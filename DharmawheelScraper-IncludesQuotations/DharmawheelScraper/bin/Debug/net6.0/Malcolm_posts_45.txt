No, deep and shallow refer to respective approaches within the environmental movement. The late David Orton writes:


Sherab Dorje said:
The distinction between “shallow” and “deep” ecology made by Naess, although perhaps an invidious comparison which some have called self-serving, nevertheless became a signature and part of the language of ecophilosophy and radical environmentalism. In fairness to Naess, he saw these two terms as “argumentation patterns” and not applied to people. (_Philosophical Dialogues: Arne Naess and the Progress of Ecophilosophy_, p. 444.) What is being called for in this age of ecology is that individuals need to define their “selves” as being part of the natural world. Naess defined the shallow ecology movement, which he says is more influential than the deep ecology movement, as “Fight against pollution and resource depletion. Central objective: the health and affluence of people in the developed countries.” The shallow approach takes for granted beliefs in technological optimism, economic growth, and scientific management and the continuation of existing industrial societies. Naess expressed it this way: “The supporters of shallow ecology think that reforming human relations toward nature can be done within the existing structure of society.” (_Selected Works_, Volume Ten, p. 16.)

Naess defined the “deep movement”, which seeks the transformation of industrial capitalist societies who have brought about the existing environmental crisis, by putting forward seven main points. The article is only a few pages long, but profound and showing the complexity of Naess. He pointed out that biological complexity required a corresponding social and cultural complexity. Outlined is an “anti-class posture” and how anti-pollution devices can, because of increasing the “prices of life necessities” increase class differences. He stressed local autonomy and decentralization.

As a mountaineer who had climbed all over the world, Naess had enjoyed the opportunity to observe political and social activism in diverse cultures. Both historically and in the contemporary movement, Naess saw two different forms of environmentalism, not necessarily incompatible with each other. One he called the “long-range deep ecology movement” and the other, the “shallow ecology movement.” The word “deep” in part referred to the level of questioning of our purposes and values when arguing in environmental conflicts. The “deep” movement involves deep questioning, right down to fundamental root causes. The short-term, shallow approach stops before the ultimate level of fundamental change, often promoting technological fixes (e.g. recycling, increased automotive efficiency, export-driven monocultural organic agriculture) based on the same consumption-oriented values and methods of the industrial economy. The long-range deep approach involves redesigning our whole systems based on values and methods that truly preserve the ecological and cultural diversity of natural systems.

This part of the conversation began when I noted that the failure of the Green Party is rooted in two things: 1) it's abandonment of a deep ecological framework (at least this is clearly the case with the dominant Green Party in the US) and 2) its subsequent adoption of Ecosocialism, which is purely green-washed old school Marxism.

Yeah i have no problem with that. I'm in agreement with Naess in that all three movements need to occur side by side. That of social justice, that of peace and that of the 'deep ecology movement.'

My "issue' is simply the insistence on the self-proclaimed name of 'deep-ecology' as the definitive title of that third movement. The name and ethos evolved from the enviriomental movement in general and not the other way around. If you asked your average person if they simply knew of the existence of the enviromental movement, most would say yes. If you asked your average person if they knew of the existence of the deep ecology movement, most would say no. Deep ecology is a species of the enviriomental movement and not the other way around. Enviriomental movements might have different ideologies but some will still remain consistent with the praxis of D.E and you can still effectively advocate for meaningful ecological progress without the need to lump things under a single title.

It would just be a case of 'a rose by any other name smelling just as sweet' if the deep ecology movement was synonymous with all forms of environmentalism but that doesn't seem to be so. Equally, there are thousands of enviriomental initiatives that are in alignment with the D.E view but have no association with them.

People are less concerned with the titles of movements and of the various 'isms' and nore conceened with whether they actually function.


Malcolm wrote:
It is a matter of perspective, mainly:

Vasana said:
You’ve been credited with having coined the expression “deep ecology.” How exactly did the idea originate?
Well, I did not coin the term “deep ecology.” I coined two terms. One is “supporter of the deep ecology movement” – a fairly long expressions. And the other is “ecosophy.” But this term “supporter of the deep ecology movement” was very soon abbreviated to “deep ecology” and supporters were called “deep ecologists.”

How does “deep” ecology differ from “shallow” ecology?

Movements are always changing and one should be cautious in saying what strictly separates two movements, like the deep and the shallow. One marked difference is that the total argumentations of those who support the shallow movement are anthropocentric in the sense that everything done to protect and restore nature sis seen as having benefit for future human generations. In deep ecology, future generations means future generations of all living beings, including rivers for example.

I was inspired to make this thread after reading a passage in Not For Happiness by Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche, in which he says:

There will also be times when none of the usual logic works and you find yourself incapable of accepting even the most patently obvious truth that death is imminent and inevitable, and not one living being—friend, family or even you yourself—can escape it. When such stubborn delusions take hold of your mind, pray to your guru, the buddhas and the bodhisattvas and beg them for help truly to accept the inexorability of death. And don’t fall into the trap of imagining you should first learn to despise samsara and develop strong “renunciation mind” before you resort to such a prayer. As the great Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Tayé said, you should rely on your guru for everything, including the blessing of no longer hungering for samsara. In fact, you should pray to your guru and ask him to make sure that you pray!

This passage gives me the idea that praying to guru the activates some sort of force that helps you along the path. The force could be coming from outside of you, or it could be a matter of psyching yourself up to unlock your hidden potential.

Statements from some of the Earth First!ers would give you the impression that the whole species is screwed up, but again, I think this is a minority dimension.

There’s a difference between saying we want to get rid of all human beings, and saying that humans aren’t the most important species on the planet.

Vasana said:
About another misunderstanding: what is your feeling about those who have used ecology to defend social Darwinism or Malthusianism? For example, David Foreman of Earth First! has been quoted as saying with regard to the Ethiopian famine, “The best thing would be to just let nature seek its own balance, to let the people there just starve.”

Dave Foreman sometimes seems to speak without much carefulness and sometimes he’s then quoted even less carefully making these statements. The only thing I can find there which can be said to be a supportable view is the opinion of many doctors who are treating Ethiopian starving children, when they say – not publicly – but when they say that the best thing for may of these children would be to die. But of course we cannot let them die. We have to, as physicians, try to heal them. Also because of the parents, we cannot let children die. Dave Foreman may have the opinion that it would be best for starving people to die, but ecological humanitarian norms among humans are such that we are extremely concerned about starvation. We have more responsibility toward humans than we do toward animals. If someone had to choose between saving a starving child and the possibility of killing the last rhinoceros, if there were no other means of saving the child, he should kill the rhinoceros and we would all think that correct. But it would be a scandal, especially among rich nations, not to help the poorer nations let living beings continue to live. In short, we are not social Darwinists.

Malcolm wrote:
And this is an important clarification by Naess:

Vasana said:
Would deep ecology preclude concern for the issues of social justice, which have become part of the agenda of left Greens?

No, I think that in this century we have three great grassroots movements: that of social justice, that of peace and that of the deep ecology movement. Those three have to cooperate intimately. It’s quite clear that the ecological crisis cannot be solved in isolation from social justice – for instance, to try to conserve rainforests without at the same time taking up the tremendous problem of what to do with relations between North and South. We have to take those problems – all of them – at once, and not say that one is more important than the others. So it’s extremely important that the social justice movement is always taken into consideration. The peace movement is too obvious to talk about at all. The military – 900 billion dollars used every year for militarism – is one of the greatest polluters in the present day. Also any kind of warlike situation immediately tends to negate every kind of concern not only for civilians but for all living beings whatsoever. So those three movements must cooperate. What distinguishes the deep ecology movements is that it is practically 100% a grassroots movement, whereas the other two have some support among the governments.

And there will be hundreds of catastrophes on the order of Chernobyl. I look forward to this trend changing in the 22nd century, at the earliest.

No.  A biocentric view would not give a flying f*ck about what happens to human beings during the transition to an ecology centered existence.  Like the title of one of my favorite Deep Ecology groups says: Earth First!  Human concerns don't get factored into the equation.

Malcolm wrote:
However inconvenient it may be to some, humans are also part of the biosphere. Deep ecology does not exclude human beings:
The well-being and flourishing of human and non-human life on Earth have value in themselves (synonyms: intrinsic value, inherent worth). These values are independent of the usefulness of the non-human world for human purposes.

Richness and diversity of life forms contribute to the realization of these values and are also values in themselves.

Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital needs.

The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantially smaller human population. The flourishing of non-human life requires a smaller human population.

Present human interference with the non-human world is excessive, and the situation is rapidly worsening.

Policies must therefore be changed. These policies affect basic economic, technological, and ideological structures. The resulting state of affairs will be deeply different from the present.

The ideological change will be mainly that of appreciating life quality (dwelling in situations of inherent value) rather than adhering to an increasingly higher standard of living. There will be a profound awareness of the difference between bigness and greatness.

Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation directly or indirectly to try to implement the necessary changes.

It is pretty simple, really —— I told you that the technology that got us to where we are today cannot fix these problems because our whole economy, as well as the technology it produced, is based on resource extraction and exploitation. Somehow, you reject this idea since you imagine, naively, that technology is value free, the old "people kill people, guns don't kill people" argument.
Guns are designed and made for killing people.  A production line can (for example) be used to make ecologically-sound recycled products.

treehuggingoctopus said:
Yes, but a part of the parcel is the role the worker plays there, the changes to their lifestyle such a role forces, the appearance of the social class in the long run... Not to mention the fact that production lines assume (and are possible in) a 100% androcentric culture, one which has the concept of "resources" (i.e., that which is what we use to create our world, which we are separate from and superior to, which is non-sentient, etc.) and thus also endorses a fundamentally androcentric (and instrumental) approach to the non-human world. Come to think of it, the seed of capitalism is there as well...

Malcolm wrote:
The whole point is that the technology we use shapes how we perceive the world. To a hammer, for example, everything is a nail. Class is nothing more nor less than divisions of society based upon who has the privilege of extracting and consuming more resources. Class is a symptom of extractive economics, not the case of extractive economics. Therefore, thinking that we need to resolve class issues in order to resolved ecological issues is both far too human-centered, and is addressing a symptom instead of a cause. Indeed, the latter fact is largely the reason Socialist economies have been every bit as much extractive economies as Capitalist ones. As I pointed out already, Socialism never created a means of production on its own, and therefore it relies on the principles of extractive economics equally as much as Capitalism.

Nope, the only way to resolve the ecological crisis is to abandon a human centered approach to civilization, and adopt a biocentric approach. As far as we know, this is the only planet that can support life such as ours. We better stop f&8cking it up.

I did not say the goal was to end nirvana. I said, in contrast to your statement that samsara has no end that indeed samsara has an end. It ends (ends for you) when nirvana begins. Of course, the corollary is that nirvana has no end, but it does have a beginning.

There was no state prior to the arising of samsara because samsara is beginningless. There is no "big bang" for samsara. The idea of a first big bang is not consistent with dependent origination, so it is either false or Buddha's teaching of dependent origination is false. The idea that the material universe contracts and expands without beginning however is perfectly consistent with dependent origination.

According to my dictionary, "primordial" can mean "existing at the beginning of time," but it can also mean "fundamental."

Time is illusory, just as all of samsara is illusory.  There can therefore be no beginning of time, much less anything which exists at the beginning of time--but, from within a "closed system" of illusion, samsara, one could perhaps understand the primordial Buddha as the fundamental state.  As Malcolm has said, this fundamental state is connate with the very non-knowing which obscures knowledge of the state.  Time itself is a result of this non-knowing.

We say that while the mind is inherently pure, since there is never any time the mind itself found this state of purity, ignorance is therefore connate.

Deep ecology is a way of arriving at a system of values, which can then be expressed through political action. The expression of those values may be no different in expression than the way so called Social Ecologists express their convictions. For example, most Buddhists are, by and large, opposed to capital punishment for any reason; so are many Catholics. The framework through which they arrive at their shared opposition to capital punishment are utterly different, but in terms of the movement that they share, the outcome desired is mutual.

As for the ādibuddha, some claim it does exist because a buddhahood without gathering accumulations is not reasonable; if there is no other buddha, the gathering accumulations itself is not reasonable; and because of beginninglessness, a single buddha is also not reasonable. Also many buddhas are not asserted because the dharmakāya is undifferentiated within the immaculate dhātu. Therefore, from the perspective of the dharmakāya, the time of full awakening and the time of being are not at odds. Therefore, from the perspective of the dharmakāya, it is also reasonable to present an ādibuddha, because ultimate nature of the dharmakāya is single."

Here are some real stats for you the world population:

Poor = 15%
Low income = 56%
Middle income = 13%
Upper-middle income 9%
High income = 7%

The income groups are defined as follows: The poor live on $2 or less daily, low income on $2.01-10, middle income on $10.01-20, upper-middle income on $20.01-50, and high income on more than $50; figures expressed in 2011 purchasing power parities in 2011 prices.

There is also the practice of the transference of consciousness, and in 90 percent of such practices, the goal of transference is Sukhavati, and Amitabha is the main object of visualization.

However, this is not the important point. The important point is what ādibuddha actually means. Candrakīrti's explanation is perfect:

As for the ādibuddha, some claim it does exist because a buddhahood without gathering accumulations is not reasonable; if there is no other buddha, the gathering accumulations itself is not reasonable; and because of beginninglessness, a single buddha is also not reasonable. Also many buddhas are not asserted because the dharmakāya is undifferentiated within the immaculate dhātu. Therefore, from the perspective of the dharmakāya, the time of full awakening and the time of being are not at odds. Therefore, from the perspective of the dharmakāya, it is also reasonable to present an ādibuddha, because ultimate nature of the dharmakāya is single."

The term "Primordial Buddha" is this: 本佛. The character translated as "Primordial" is 本.

本 has a wide range of meanings - From the Digital Dictionary of Buddhism
Basic Meaning: root
Senses:

Source, origin, essence, basis. To be rooted in, to find the origin in (Skt. upâdāya; Tib. nye bar bzung nas). The Sanskrit mūla, pūrva, ādi ( 'root' ) is transliterated as 慕攞. (Skt. prakṛti; grantha; atyanta, ākara, aditas, uddeśa, eva, jātīya, dravya, nityam, purā, purāṇa, puri, purima, pure, pūrvaka, pūrva-kāla, pūrva-prahīṇa, pūrvam, pūrvânta, pūrvika, paurāṇa, paurāṇaka, paurvika, prakṛtyā, pradhāna, bimba, bhāva, mūla-yoni, maula, yoni, samam, saṃbhava, sarvathā, sva) [Charles Muller; source(s): Nakamura, YBh-Ind, Hirakawa]

In Buddhist texts, often found in such compound words as 'original nature'  本性, 'original enlightenment'  本覺, or 'original Buddhahood' 本佛, indicating the human mind which is in essence undefiled and enlightened. [Charles Muller]

Radical, fundamental, original, principal, one's own; the Buddha himself, contrasted with 蹟, traces left by him among men to educate them; also a volume of a book. [Charles Muller; source(s): Soothill]

Book, document. [Charles Muller]

Early Middle Chinese (Pulleyblank 1991, p. 31): 'Originally, in its origin' ; 'once,' past tense Adverbial use: sentential adverb, following the subject: 'originally,' derived from the nominal meaning 'origin, source' . Classical, Han period Chinese, Buddhist literature. [Barbara Meisterernst]

Aspecto-temporal adverb in the Buddhist literature: preceding the verb, i.e. in the syntactic position typical for aspecto-temporal adverbs (following modal adverbs, but preceding prepositional phrases and manner adverbs): 'past tense,' 'once' . In this position similar to céng 曾. [Barbara Meisterernst]

'Etiology' of a disease, as in the compound 病本 [Robert Buswell]

There are three pieces of scripture, which are just scripture I know, but they shed some more light on this issue, at least from a historical perspective: Now, the Blessed One has said, "Whoever sees dependent co-arising sees the Dhamma; whoever sees the Dhamma sees dependent co-arising."
(MN 28 in the Pali Canon) Enough Vakkali! Why do you want to see this foul body? One who sees the Dhamma sees me; one who sees me sees the Dhamma. For in seeing the dhamma, Vakkali, one sees me; and in seeing me one sees the Dhamma.
(SN 22.87 in the Pali Canon again)

Not having a good handle on Chinese, I have little access to the āgamas, it is possible these quotes have parallels there. Nonetheless I found these quotes somewhat foundational for the Primordial Buddha discourse.

As if, venerable sir, a person were to turn face upward what is upside down, or to uncover the concealed, or to point the way to one who is lost or to carry a lamp in the darkness, thinking, 'Those who have eyes will see visible objects,' so has the Dhamma been set forth in many ways by the Blessed One. We, venerable sir, go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma for refuge, and to the Community of Bhikkhus for refuge. Venerable sir, may the Blessed One regard us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life, from today."
Significantly, this sūtra merely shows a form of boosterism for the Buddha. It should be balanced with this from the Eastern Gatehouse Sutta:

"Excellent, Sariputta. Excellent. Those who have not known, seen, penetrated, realized, or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction in others that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed & pursued, gains a footing in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal & consummation; whereas those who have known, seen, penetrated, realized, & attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed & pursued, gains a footing in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal & consummation."

The idea that there is a hard distinction between conditioned and unconditioned phenomena is a form of realism. The Dzogchen point of view is best, IMO:

The mind that clings to entities and clings to cause and result
itself appears as cause and condition, but because they are nondual, there is no arising and perishing. 
Because there is no arising and perishing, there is no self and other. Because there is no death and transmigration, there is no permanence and annihilation.

Thanks. Isn't that at times the meaning of unconditioned when the term is used in (some translations of) Dzogchen texts?

Malcolm wrote:
You can describe it like that, sure.

In Original Mind, MIpham makes this disctinction between the view of sūtra and the view of Anuyoga:

Furthermore, the Avatamska Sūtra asserts that the kāyas and pristine consciousnesses of buddhahood are impermanent by nature, but permanent by continuum. Those who assert the kāyas and pristine consciousnesses as the nature of the emptiness that possesses the supreme of all aspects are asserting that the kāyas and pristine consciousnesses are permanent by nature, and are asserting that they are impermanent by nature in the mode of appearing to trainees, according to what is taught in the Sūtra that Gathers All Intentions.

As such, from the perspective of the way reality is, while any phenomena included in the three times never moves from being the same by lacking birth and cessation in the natural state, since there is no need to reject or accept one side or the other of this duality arising distinctly as all phenomena there are such as self and other, samsara and nirvana, conditioned and unconditioned, past, present and future and so on, those in whom meaning of noncontradictory two truths that are equivalent with the teachings of the principles of realization endowed with eight profundities will easily give rise to the doubtless certain knowledge that is the intention of the sūtras and tantras of Mahāyāna.
He mentions in another text:
In both the example luminosity and the vidyā of the Great Perfection, the reflection of the sky-like meaning luminosity is an appearance for the water-like mind. Though emptiness is ascertained by the mind (that meditates on emptiness) to be unconditioned, while the mind (in which that aspect arises) is unconditioned, a mind and an emptiness that are discrete will not appear in experience, but will be distinguished in the subsequent knowledge, just like the form of the sky in the water.

But it is never said that the mind arises from ignorance. Furthermore, your metaphor is mistaken. Bread may not have soil in it, but that is because bread is something refined from wheat. Wheat itself is inedible. It requires a great deal of processing to turn into bread.

The lotus example is used to describe how it is that the Buddha appeared in the swamp of samsara without being affected by it. The swamp is merely a condition, it is not a cause. The cause of a lotus is a lotus seed (bodhicitta). If you propose something which is a cause, like a wheat seed, it should produce a wheat plant, and not a lotus flower. Likewise, if the cause of the mind is ignorance (wheat seed) it is impossible that a mind could ever be awakened (lotus), since its nature and its continuum is inherently ignorant (wheat), since its cause is ignorance (wheat seed).

Then how come, that our behaviour is often in contradiction of your wise sharing here? How come that partiality still is and so the basis of singularity is? There is no self and other. _/\_ How come mind still clings in behaviour to entities?

Yes. Any clinging is our problem, just as clinging to cause and result. But when we do not know the cause of our suffering, we suffer the results and this not knowing is itself by the idea of a singularity its’ confused clinging to entities/things and so it’s actions = karma.

I think it is good to reflect and contemplate about what you shared here.

Astus said:
Of course. What is it that drives the mind? The Hinayana position is that it is ignorance, and with the ignorance removed there is no reason for another birth. Mahayana follows that view, that's why it needs to exchange ignorance with aspirations, since that type of understanding comes from the Hinayana version of the bodhisattva path, in other words, all the Mahayana explanations are built to back up an already accepted model. And the problem I see here is that it lacks the explanation for why arhats could not simply end the process, thus questioning the assumption that the mind-stream is unceasing.

Malcolm wrote:
If ignorance were the ultimate or first cause of the mind (it isn't) than everything you say would make sense. But ignorance is not the ultimate or first cause of the mind, and in fact, ignorance is not inherent to the mind, as your query suggests.

In fact, it is affliction in general that drives samsara, but afflictions do not drive the mind.

Third, just because one no longer takes rebirth in the three realms does not mean that one's mind has ceased to exist. The mind does not exist in the three realms; the three realms exist in the mind.

Ignorance cannot be what sustains rebirth, because then arhats would be finished, as they are without aspirations. It also cannot be established that arhats grasp at non-existence and that's why they succumb temporarily to an inactive state, since they are without any form of identification with anything. Furthermore, if aspirations are necessary for the buddhas to remain functional, that in itself means that dependent origination is driven by mental effort.

For bodhisattvas and buddhas compassion is said to be the driving force so that they don't abandon beings. Such a condition is needed if birth can end. But since birth cannot end, there is no need for such an aspiration, and there is always either a deluded or an enlightened inclination that sustains birth, in which case both types of beings are subjects to birth and death. Thus nirvana is samsara.

Call Houston a drunk if you want to, but he did advise against joining the Civil War:
Unknown said:
Many Texans considered the election of Abraham Lincoln to the presidency (November 1860) as a threat to slavery. They urged Governor Sam Houston to call a convention of the people to determine what course of action the state should take. Houston, devoted both to Texas and the Union, paid little heed to these requests, refusing to take any step that might aid secession. The demands for a convention increased, however, with the secession of South Carolina in December 1860 and the calling of state secession conventions in Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia, and Louisiana in early January. A group of secessionist leaders, including O. M. Roberts, John S. (Rip) Ford, George M. Flournoy, and William P. Rogers, issued an address to the people calling for the election of delegates to a state Secession Convention in early January. Houston attempted to forestall the convention by calling a special session of the legislature and recommending that it refuse to recognize the convention. Instead, the legislature gave approval to the convention, on the condition that the people ratify its outcome by a final vote.

The convention, which assembled in Austin on January 28, 1861, was dominated by secessionists. On February 1 the delegates adopted an ordinance of secession by a vote of 166 to 8. This ordinance was approved by the voters of the state, 46,153 to 14,747, on February 23. The convention reassembled in early March, declared Texas out of the Union, and adopted a measure uniting the state with other Southern states in the newly formed Confederate States of America. Governor Houston, who refused to recognize the authority of the convention to take this action, refused to take an oath of allegiance to the new government, whereupon the convention declared the office of governor vacant and elevated Lieutenant Governor Edward Clark to the position. President Lincoln offered to send troops to assist Houston if he would resist the convention, but Houston rejected the offer rather than bring on civil conflict within the state. He retired to his home in Huntsville, where he died on July 26, 1863.

Malcolm wrote:
It appears he both rejected the Confederacy, as well as rejected help from Lincoln to restore order.

Anyway, my main point still stands, "I like where I live too. This does not blind me to the fact that I live here by virtue of the fact that English Settlers began a program of ethnic cleansing and genocide against native people beginning in the 17th century", etc. This is as true of Texas as it is true of everywhere else in the United States and Canada, i.e, the wherever there was an Anglo Hegemony. The Spanish hegemony in Mexico, etc., has its own analysis and problems.

Dunbar-Ortiz writes:

Admin_PC said:
The Republic of Mexico opened a door to US domination by granting land to Anglo immigrants. During the first decade of Mexican independence, some thirty thousand Anglo-American farmers and plantation owners, along with their slaves, poured into Texas, receiving development land grants. By the time Texas became a US state in 1845, Anglo settlers numbered 160,000.18 Mexico abolished slavery in 1829, which affected the Anglo-American settlers’ quest for wealth in building plantations worked by enslaved Africans. They lobbied the Mexican government for a reversal of the ban and gained only a one-year extension to settle their affairs and free their bonded workers— the government refused to legalize slavery. The settlers decided to secede from Mexico, initiating the famous and mythologized 1836 Battle of the Alamo, where the mercenaries James Bowie and Davy Crockett and slave owner William Travis were killed. Although technically an Anglo-American loss, the siege of the Alamo served to stir Anglo patriotic passions, and within a month at the decisive Battle of San Jacinto, Mexico handed over the province. This was a great victory for the Andrew Jackson administration, for Jackson’s brother, Mason, who was one of the Texas planters, and especially for the alcoholic settler-warrior hero Sam Houston. The former governor of Tennessee, Houston was made commander in chief of the Texas army and president of the new “Texas republic,” which he helped guide to US statehood in 1845. One of the first acts of the pro-slavery independent government was to establish a counterinsurgency force that— as its name, the Texas Rangers, suggests— followed the “American way of war” in destroying Indigenous towns, eliminating Native nations in Texas, pursuing ethnic cleansing, and suppressing protest from Tejanos, former Mexican citizens.

“REDSKINS”
Indigenous people continued to resist by burning settlements and killing and capturing settlers. As an incentive to recruit fighters, colonial authorities introduced a program of scalp hunting that became a permanent and long-lasting element of settler warfare against Indigenous nations. During the Pequot War, Connecticut and Massachusetts colonial officials had offered bounties initially for the heads of murdered Indigenous people and later for only their scalps, which were more portable in large numbers. But scalp hunting became routine only in the mid-1670s, following an incident on the northern frontier of the Massachusetts colony. The practice began in earnest in 1697 when settler Hannah Dustin, having murdered ten of her Abenaki captors in a nighttime escape, presented their ten scalps to the Massachusetts General Assembly and was rewarded with bounties for two men, two women, and six children.

Dustin soon became a folk hero among New England settlers. Scalp hunting became a lucrative commercial practice. The settler authorities had hit upon a way to encourage settlers to take off on their own or with a few others to gather scalps, at random, for the reward money. “In the process,” John Grenier points out, “they established the large-scale privatization of war within American frontier communities.” Although the colonial government in time raised the bounty for adult male scalps, lowered that for adult females, and eliminated that for Indigenous children under ten, the age and gender of victims were not easily distinguished by their scalps nor checked carefully. What is more, the scalp hunter could take the children captive and sell them into slavery. These practices erased any remaining distinction between Indigenous combatants and noncombatants and introduced a market for Indigenous slaves. Bounties for Indigenous scalps were honored even in absence of war. Scalps and Indigenous children became means of exchange, currency, and this development may even have created a black market. Scalp hunting was not only a profitable privatized enterprise but also a means to eradicate or subjugate the Indigenous population of the Anglo-American Atlantic seaboard. The settlers gave a name to the mutilated and bloody corpses they left in the wake of scalp-hunts: redskins.

All of this, I now think, is not quite right. “Deism” in its own day referred not to a superficial theological doctrine but to a comprehensive intellectual tradition that ranged freely across the terrain we now associate with ethics, political theory, metaphysics, the philosophy of mind, and epistemology. It was an astonishingly coherent and systematic body of thought, closer to a way of being than any particular dogma, and it retained its essential elements over a span of centuries, not decades. In origin and substance, deism was neither British nor Christian, as the conventional view supposes, but largely ancient, pagan, and continental, and it spread in America far beyond the educated elite. Although America’s revolutionary deists lavished many sincere expressions of adoration upon their deity, deism is in fact functionally indistinguishable from what we would now call “pantheism”; and pantheism is really just a pretty word for atheism. While deism could often be associated with moderation in politics, it served principally to advance a system of thought that was revolutionary in its essence and effects. This essentially atheistic and revolutionary aspect of deism, I further contend, is central to any credible explanation of the revolutionary dimension of the American Revolution. In a word, America’s founders were philosophical radicals.

Any direct introduction possesses three lineages: the aural lineage, the symbolic lineage and the lineage of the transcendent state.

You must be able to understand the first two in order to grasp the meaning, which is contained in the third.

All of this constitutes empowerment of the potentiality of vidyā (rig pa'i rtsal dbang). This is why the Syllableless Tantra states states:
[T]he dharmakāya is encountered in the intimate instruction.
The dharmakāya is the lineage of the transcendent state; the intimate instruction is the aural lineage and the symbolic lineage.

Tantric empowerments only grant one a conceptual idea. They start with the idea that there  are aggregates which in fact need to be transformed into buddha families, for example, like applying an elixir to a base metal to transform it into gold.

Dzogchen starts with the idea that there is nothing to transform, just something to point out. As Vimalamitra states in Buddhahood in this Life:
If it is objected, “If afflictions are liberated into dharmatā without antidotes, there is no need for purification on the path. Otherwise, liberation would require no effort,” for what reason would those who do not understand be liberated? Asserting that those who understand are liberated merely by recognizing concepts as dharmatā is the fruit of one’s wishes. As such, in order to recognize that concepts are dharmatā, the intimate instructions of the guru are important.
Supporting this perspective, the Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra states:
ecause it exists to be explained,
the result is attained through the explanation.
If not explained, how can there be liberation?
There are no signs in the dharmas of the basis,
no grasping to the dharmas of the path,
and no attainment of the dharmatā of the result.
The basis of sentient beings and the basis of buddhahood
is definitely differentiated by a sole difference.
For what reason is there a sole difference?
Why is it called “the sole difference?”
The basis of buddhahood is pristine consciousness;
the basis of sentient-beinghood is not pristine consciousness.
When both the pristine state (ye) and the consciousness (shes pa) of
it are combined,
it is the sublime transcendent state of the buddhas.
Therefore, what other differences are there?

Crazywisdom,

In Dzogchen there is gzhi, lam, and 'bras bu, in other words base, path, and fruit. This is something Dzogchen teachers teach all the time.

There has to be a base, and a path, and a fruit, because it is a complete path lacking nothing. Otherwise if Dzogchen was only the result, it'd just begin and end with "the fruit", but that's really not the case.

Crazywisdom said:
I know what they say. Im challenging the conceptual regimen. Let's look at your statement. It contains some Tibetan words. Looks so scholarly. But wait, I see a non sequitur: there has to be a base, path and fruit because it is a complete path lacking nothing. This is like poetry, not reasoning.

Then you contradict Malcom, bc he said the result does not arise from a cause. So by his statements the result results the result. There might as well be a result, a result and a result. Because the base, path and result are inseparable, by the terms of that teaching.

Malcolm wrote:
Basis path and result has a different meaning in Dzogchen.

The basis here is not a cause, it is something one did not know.

The path is recognizing what that basis is, based on the teacher's instructions which result in direct perception.

The result is fully experiencing the qualities of that basis.

Thus, Dzogchen is the result that does not arise from a cause.

For example, let us imagine that we are living on an island of gold. But we have no idea what gold is, and so we make various discriminations between things on that island, liking this one, disliking that one, not recognizing their nature is the same.

Someone explains to us what gold is, and then tells us to look past our conceptual discriminations to see what is actually there in our direct perception, i.e., gold.

In the end, when we have ascertained that everything on the island is gold, then we have nothing left to do.

This both what "the result that does not arise from a cause" means, and also what the basis, path and result are in Dzogchen.

Since all appearances that occur are one of the five aggregates and six areas, there cannot be anything an arhat grasps as self or belonging to a self. Furthermore, belief in any kind of substance can occur only in the aggregates, and since no aggregate is grasped, no view can be grasped either.

Malcolm wrote:
Not so. When we say that "Arhats realize the selfless of the aggregates," in fact they do not realize the selflessness of the aggregates themselves, rather, only the selflessness of the person imputed on the aggregates. Gorampa points out:

Now then, if it is thought that one will be able to give up the grasping true existence of grasping the true existence in the aggregates with the unimpeded path of the śrāvakas, since apprehending the non-existence of true existence of the aggregates is not the main point, but apprehending the non-existence of the true existence of the person is the main point, there is no error. Likewise, since apprehending the non-existence of the true existence of the apprehended outer objects is the main point of the unimpeded path of the path of seeing of the pratyekabuddhas, it is possible to give up the grasping true existence of grasping the true existence in outer apprehended objects, but it is not possible to give up the knowledge obscuration beyond that. 

Because apprehending the freedom from proliferation of the four extremes with the unimpeded path of the path of seeing of Mahāyāna is the main point, that is the point of being able to give up all knowledge obscurations.

...

In brief, primary object of realization of śrāvakas is the selflessness of the person but that realization grasps true existence in the aggregates. It is necessary to reject [such grasping to true existence] because grasping true existence of grasping the true existence in the aggregates has the unimpeded power to cause the actual grasping to the self of persons. The primary object of realization of pratyekabuddhas is [42/b] the non-existence of true existence in apprehended outer objects. Because the primary object of realization of Mahāyāna is freedom from all proliferations of dualistic grasping, the difference in views are vast. 


---


In the context of the Abhisamayālaṃkāra, since the unshared path of the Mahāyāna is primarily explained, having considered that the realization of freedom from proliferation is the realization of the selflessness of phenomena, that is said not to exist for śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.

Moreover if it is inquired “If it is not possible to abandon the knowledge obscurations below the seventh stage, what object to give up would a śrāvaka Arhat entering the Mahāyāna path give up at the seventh stage?” It will be necessary to hide one’s head under a fur coat.

 
Some, wishing to avoid that error, claim “Śrāvaka Arhats enter from the eighth stage”, which is a truly inferior standpoint. If that were so, in order to accomplish Buddhahood from the very beginning it would be quicker to enter the śrāvaka path than the Mahāyāna path, since the latter must take wait two incalculable eons before attaining the eighth bodhisattva stage while the former can attain the state of an Arhat in three lifetimes through rapid effort, and afterwards it would then be sufficient to enter on the eighth stage. Also this appears to be a belittling affront to Mahāyāna

Kindly clarify your understanding please?

Malcolm wrote:
The reason why this debate exists in this tantra is because it reflects a debate on the ground in the 8th century between the Indian forbears of the Dzogchen tradition, Śṛī Siṃha et al and other Indians invested in the formal process of what we have come to refer, in blanket terms, as the stages of creation and completion. The passage itself favors those Indians who favored the formal process of the two stages. But the mere fact that the question exists in this tantra (which emerged following the era in which Śṛī Siṃha and co. lived) proves that this was a significant debate in Indian Vajrayāna circles as a relatively early time.

But the creation and completion stages, as envisioned for example in the system of Sakya Lamdre or Naro Khachöma, is completely irrelevant to Dzogchen theory and practice. There is simply no need to go through the conceptual exercise of transforming one's aggregates, sense bases and elements in a mandala of deities, nor is there any need to work with karma vāyus, or relative nāḍis and bindus in the manner of the various completion stage systems such as those found in Lamdre, the Six Dharmas of Naropa, etc.

It is for this reason that tantras like Hevajra are considered provisional in Dzogchen teachings.

What in fact that Dzogchen tradition rejects is that the two stages are needed at all. They can be used if desired, but they are not necessary. Further, another consequence of this is that yogas derived from so called "completion stage" repertoire can be used without needing to engage in creation at all.

There is simply no need at all, from a Dzogchen perspective, to engage in the conceptual exercise of substituting pure vision for impure vision when in fact the vision of pristine consciousness is constantly available to anyone to perceive at any time at all providing they have the proper instructions. If you want to learn what this means, find a real Dzogchen master.

This is really just a result of how the pie is sliced. Actual Mahamudra is also beyond cause and result, so if we classified HYT and Mahamudra the way the Nine yana system is set up, we would divide HYT into maha and anu and Mahamudra would correspond to Dzogchen

The state of Mahāmudra, Dzogchen, and Prajñāparamitā is the same state. What distinguishes these are their respective paths. Unlike Mahāmudra and Prajñāpāramita, the actual path of Dzogchen itself is beyond cause and result.

If one engages in KyeRim, for instance, which is mind-based, but with one's Awareness of the Nature permeating all mental activities, is that a deviation, in the Dzogchen system?

conebeckham said:
Thus, for one who practices Dzogchen, deity practices are either deviations--if one understands those practices to be means toward Buddhahood--or not, if one practices with other "goals" or "mundane needs" in mind?

Malcolm wrote:
Mipham explains it well, in his commentary on Mañjuśrimitra's Meditation of Awakened Mind:
If it is asked, “What is the method of realizing the definitive meaning through the indirect method?,” since nonactivity is illustrated with the activity of fabricated efforts, like pointing to the moon with the finger, also awakened mind correctly grasped through a symbol will accomplish awakening, because the Bhagavan Buddha, the teacher of devas and humans, has declared that it is “great awakening.” Any unfortunate one who conceptualizes entities should make efforts in the indirect method of realization.
This unfortunate one is anyone who has not discovered vidyā, or has difficulty doing so.

And:
If one meditates generating the thought that the samadhis and the mudras are dharmatā, and therefore are not different, the ultimate awakened mind arises from that. If one actualizes the meditation, one realizes that all phenomena do not exist apart from one’s mind. The accumulations are gathered and obscurations are purified because of that meditation. One becomes realized through one’s continuum being blessed by the deity of pristine consciousness.

Not in my experience--though of course, there is a presentation of Mahamudra as "fruition," and gathering the two accumulations, etc., as path practices, along with pretty much every other practice one can engage in, including the two stages, leads to a "goal," there is also a way of understanding Mahamudra as "Ground" and "Path."

Basically, when someone who is a Dzogchen pracitioner is using methods such as deity yoga, they are using mind to try and go beyond mind. This is a valid approach. However, actual Dzogchen practice means you have already understood what it means to go beyond mind, and have left that kind of practice behind as a path. At that point, practices involving mind are used to gather accumulations, deal with illness and obstacles, and so on, for example the practice of Sang offerings is useful with there are problems with local guardians and so on.

Dzogchen practitioners can use various methods in order to overcome problems that arise because of impure vision and karma, but the actual path of Dzogchen is never based on concepts and mind, unlike mahāyoga and anuyoga, and the rest of the Buddhist and non-Buddhist vehicles. This is all very straight forward and explained at length in the primary literature of Dzogchen.

maybe having a rational mind that can think logically is what they mean by having a penis?

Astus said:
The female body has several drawbacks in Buddhism. First of all, there are the "five obstacles, three subordinations" (
五障三從), that is, no woman can become brahma, indra, mara, cakravartin, or buddha; and they are subject to their father as a child, their husband as an adult, and their son as an old person. Furthermore, particularly in East Asian Buddhism, they are impure from menstruation (see: http://www.onmarkproductions.com/menstration-sutra-michael-kelsey.pdf and http://www.reed.edu/hellscrolls/scrolls/Aseries/A06/A06e.html ), and suffer from giving birth (see: http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/filial-sutra.htm ). It is also a regular theme that women are overly passionate.

Here is a famous section from the Nirvana Sutra (tr Yamamoto, ch 16):

"All good men and women desire to be born as a man. Why so? Because females are the nests of evil. Also, it is as in the case of the water of mosquitoes and sawflies, which cannot moisten this great earth. In addition, the sensual appetite of females cannot ever be satisfied."

But eventually the scripture states:

"Any person who does not realise that he has the Buddha-Nature is a woman. If he does so realise, he is a man. If any woman knows that she has the Buddha-Nature, she is a man."

Any woman who has been afflicted by the one hundred faults of womanhood, despises the state of womanhood, and wishes to be completely free from the birth place of women, they will avoid the state of womanhood and will produce male genitalia until they reach final awakening.

Sure, he thinks that everyone but right wing nut jobs should have free speech and right to assembly, unless he disagrees with what they too say, in which case they don't, since it is all down to what some imaginary committee in his head is going to define as acceptable speech for everyone. Orwell had it right when he said:
But freedom, as Rosa Luxembourg [sic] said, is ‘freedom for the other fellow’. The same principle is contained in the famous words of Voltaire: ‘I detest what you say; I will defend to the death your right to say it.’ If the intellectual liberty which without a doubt has been one of the distinguishing marks of western civilisation means anything at all, it means that everyone shall have the right to say and to print what he believes to be the truth, provided only that it does not harm the rest of the community in some quite unmistakable way
And:
These people don’t see that if you encourage totalitarian methods, the time may come when they will be used against you instead of for you. Make a habit of imprisoning Fascists without trial, and perhaps the process won’t stop at Fascists.

There are of course laws banning incitement, since incitement to criminal actions is not protected speech. But in order to ban such speech, incitement has to be proven. In other words, someone can say, "We ought to go out and shoot some Mexicans," and this is protected speech as long as no one responds to it or takes it seriously, as several cases where idle threats made against the life of POTUS has shown.

But if someone responds to it, and it can be a) shown that the author of such speech actually intended harm, and b) some other parties went out and engaged in that harm, then it becomes incitement.

But what you are recommending is effectively thought policing.

The long and short of it however is this. When someone decides to control freedom of speech, this creates the issues of authority, "who can control speech?"

What is the criteria? Why do we decide to ban Mein Kampf, but to allow the publication of Mao's little Red Book?  Or Naked Lunch? Lolita? etc.

"Hate" is too broad a criteria, just like obscenity.

One has to demonstrate that a specific act of speech has harmed someone; for example, in the US one can refer to someone as a Jew as in "Stanley is a Jew, I saw him at Temple the other day." This is not harmful speech, and no one would blink at it.

Saying to someone on an internet forum, "That Stanley is goddamn Jew," is unpleasant, but it is protected speech, at least in the US. Stanley would have to go out of his way to prove harm.

Saying  "Stanley, you damn Jew" on the other hand is a civil rights violation, this will cause you to wind up in jail, since you are addressing Stanley directly.

Americans have not had to struggle with the tanglible outcomes of Facsist, Stalinist and Nazi (style) dictatorships since the early 1900's.  In western Europe the last long-running regime of this type fell only recently (Portugal 1932-1974).  In Greece we had a short lived Fascist military junta from 1968-1974.

The proponents of these political regimes utilised democracy and its tools (freedom of speech) in order to abolish democracy.  They are doing the same thing now in many countries, especially in the former Eastern Bloc countries (cf Ukraine).  And let's not forget the war in former Yugoslavia that reignited pro-Soviet era Nationalistic tendencies and lead to all sorts of horrific slaughters.

Now while you may believe that the American approach is a more "adult" approach, the reality is that a large proportion of the citizens within democracies are not political adults.  This is why one sees, for example, the likelihood of Trump being voted into power.  Or the Bush dynasty.

Free speech also assumes that everybody is being heard at an equal volume.  This is also naive to the point of brain death.

If the playing field were level, then there could be freedom of speech.  But as things stand, the notion of freedom of speech, especially somewhere like the US, is a farce and a scam.

Given all this, the least that a politically mature citizen can ask for is that hate speech is not allowed.  Unfortunately the Chinese proverb:  Kill the rooster to quiet the monkeys is very practical.  Particularly when applied to the types of primates that run to the support of hate mongers.

Malcolm wrote:
We are all tulkus.

Footsteps said:
The purpose of this post is to settle a controversy [and perhaps create another] and remove a misunderstanding about so called "sprul skus" or reincarnations, that venerable institution that causes so much controversy in Tibetan Buddhism.

In the teaching of the great perfection there are two kinds of so called nirmanakāyas or tulkus. First, there are impure forward-progression [ma dag pa lugs 'byung] nirmanakāyas  i.e. all sentient beings. These arise because of ignorance.

The second are pure reverse-progression [dag pa lugs ldog] nirmanakāyas: among these there are also two, those that come from the dharmakāya and sambhogakāya, nirmanākāyas of compassion if you will. The second are called nirmanakāyas of the attained result, these are sentient beings of pure karma, blessed by being seen by the buddhas, who make more and more progress, attaining higher and higher states of yogic understanding.

Thus we sentient beings are all nirmanakāyas -- differentiated only by our level of relative attainment and relative level of pure and impure karma.

The so-called "tulkus" of institutional Tibetan Buddhism are also sentient beings; some with higher yogic attainments, some with none, and others with some. Because they are sentient beings, some remember their rebirths well, and others not at all. Some achieve high levels of yogic understanding, some are great teachers, some are panditas, poets and artists. Some tulkus are mere politicians, some are gangsters, some are thieves. But they are all sentient beings. Not one of them was not born from the womb of a human mother.

Most tulkus are never "recognized" because anyone who practices Dharma sincerely is a tulku, no matter what level of "realization" they are reputed to have, whether or not they have been recognized. In this sense, a tulku is defined as someone who acts to help sentient beings inspired by the compassion of the buddhas for sentient beings.

We are all rinpoches, precious ones. Sentient beings are precious because their plight is the cause of the compassion of the buddhas. Buddhas are precious because they exist solely to aid sentient beings from suffering. I guess you could say it is rinpoches all the way down.

Some people crave recognition, wanting others to acknowledge their status -- consider yourselves acknowledged  but don't expect a title. If you want people to consider you a tulku, act like one. If you must, fake it. Faking it may even lead to developing some real compassion which exceeds your petty narrow-minded grasping to titles and position. Being a pure reverse-progression tulku means cherishing all sentient beings. Nothing is holding you back but your own selfishness.

The Dzogchen teachings acknowledge that all sentient beings are tulkus. But whether that is meaningful is not up to the buddhas, it is up to each one of us and our dedication to the path of awakening and benefitting our fellow tulkus.

In reality, tulkuhood is defined not by robes, titles, race, position, gender, education, or creed but by how we are able to apply wisdom and compassion in our efforts to aid sentient beings and alleviate their suffering.

Okay.  In other words, methods of praxis, including tantras, sadhanas, and instructions, will reflect the environment of their gestation, or revalation, or whatnot.  It seems to me that, with the exception of the very highest methods of practice, the majority of practice paths will have no choice but to represent the inequality present in that environment.  I suppose the question is whether Vajrayana MUST reflect the power structures and dynamics of the environment, with respect to gender, and perhaps other factors--whether such characteristics are essential to Vajrayana, in other words, or whether those dynamics and power structures can be corrected, equalized to a greater or lesser degree, etc., by practitioners or other sentient beings, thereby allowing practice paths and methods that reflect this less hierarchical, more "flat" (equal) environment.

So, Vajrayana, and Buddhism in general, is soiled with patriarchy all over the place. Being aware of this and learning not to play into it is in itself step forward, but then what? What is the skilful way forward that avoids these errors then?


Malcolm wrote:
Awareness itself is the first step. Empowering women is the second. Maybay complained that there were no women (AFAWK) in this conversation, but that is ok. Women already know that Vajrayāna is a patriarchal system. The people who are ignorant of this fact are men, who are privileged by the system.

People complain about Western culture all the time, and much of their complaint has a base. But the one point where Western civilization has come to surpass others is in our recognition of women's rights. Indeed, most of the animosity aimed at the "profligate" nature of Western civilization is based on the freedom women here experience, compared to that in more "traditional" societies.

I find these kinds of attitudes towards animals and their suffering to be perfect exemplars of how patriarchs are given to behave. The point is really that people are ready to excuse such actions in their transvalued guru figure, when they would never excuse such an action in a maybay or Malcolm.

What is most amazing to me, is that people do not even experience qualms over stories such as these.

That said, of course we cannot box Chökyi Lödo's life into one incident when he was an old man who just lost his country. But at least he had been assigned a devout teenage women to care for his needs (oh, wait, another patriarchal trope).

The point is really not the person, the point is the environment in which we operate. Vajrayāna has been a patriarchal system for all of its history, not just a part. Even its reliance on the trope, "ḍākinīs as reservoirs for wisdom" is a transgressive element in an otherwise male-dominated world that serves male needs.

So one day, Khyentse Chokyi Lodro rather abruptly said, "We should cut off the monkey's tail right now." Tashi Namgyal held the monkey and I held the tail and Khyentse Chokyi Lodro cut off his tail with a kitchen knife. Afterward I thought that Khyentse Chokyi Lodro might change his expression somehow - that perhaps he would be sad or feel compassion for the monkey, but to my surprise he remained perfectly relaxed and normal.
(DKR is the narrator)

Yes, absolutely. If someone cut off your arm, for example, wouldn't you described this as torture? Monkeys use their tail as a limb.

dzogchungpa said:
torture |ˈtôrCHər|
noun
the action or practice of inflicting severe pain on someone as a punishment or to force them to do or say something, or for the pleasure of the person inflicting the pain.
• great physical or mental suffering or anxiety: the torture I've gone through because of loving you so.
• a cause of suffering or anxiety: dances were absolute torture because I was so small.

That sounds to me too broad a question. Practitioners are individuals, and people can use for practice all sorts of things, and approach the same method in many ways. As for the ideal part, there is creation stage, and there are various forms of completion stage: six yogas, dzogchen, and mahamudra. All four could be combined, all four can be used separately, and in any other setting. Besides that, I guess you are already familiar with the general descriptions of those methods.

“This yoga of the completion stage,
its joy is called great bliss.
Completion is not a meditation,
so why do creation?”

The Bhgavan replied:

“Incredible, the great bodhisattva,
has lost the power of faith.
Where does bliss come from without the existence of the body?
Such bliss cannot be spoken of.
Joy pervades all migrating beings

Malcolm wrote:
No, there are of course various interpretive schemes for the Indian tantras, the six limits, and so on. It can be fun an interesting to read various attempts by Indian panditas to explain these things. And when it comes to the same tantra, different Panditas have wildly different explanations, meaning that there was very little consensus on just how to interpret these tantras. Of course, than there is the fact that Tibetans, in general, preferred violence to eroticism, which is why the more popular yidams among Tibetans are Vajrabhairava, Vajrakīlaya, and so on.

Are we certain that what we have in this or that text are the literal words of this or that Buddha, free from editing by human beings? I am not so certain. Are you?

This is one reason, that as a class of literature, I like Dzogchen tantras. They are, like the Dohas of Saraha and Virupa, largely free from, or explicitly critical of, all of this kind of imagery, apart from what they inherent from the Guhyagarbha in terms of the mandala of peaceful and wrathful deities. But in Dzogchen tantras, the so called "antinomian" aspects of the Guhyagarba are so sublimated as to be nonexistent. This is another reason why Dzogchen is more appropriate today, because it has a place in a post-patriarchal society. Cakrasamvara, Hevajra, etc., will have a more difficult time.

Karma does not make senseless violence sensible, nor injustice just. The operations of karma are beyond sense and justice. They are relentless.

The ripening of karma is something which we all experience. For example, if could be the case that in the past, this person destroyed a spiders nest with juvenile spiders with some intense anger and hatred. What we consider small actions can have a very large result.

Content:
Malcolm wrote:
Basically folks, Vajrayāna reflects male, patriarchal values. Just accept this is so and move on.

Does this mean that Vajrayāna cannot itself move beyond such values? Of course not (that's why we have termas).

But we do ourselves a disservice by pretending that some of the tropes in Vajrayāna which are deeply sexist do not exist, and are in fact based on the idea of women as disposable property. For example, one hears accounts of young women who died after being used during empowerments.

There is an inherent sexism in the trope of lower caste women being used by upper caste males.

While some revisionist scholars such as Miranda Shaw indulge in romantic fantasies about the origins of Vajrayāna being grounded in subaltern female gurus, we should shelve such interpretations for the fantasies that they are.

While it is true that there were female gurus in ancient India, and continuing on in Tibet, we still have Yeshe Tsogyal referring to herself over and over again as someone of lower birth ( skye dman ) and small intelligence ( shes rab chung ) merely because she is a women.

The very fact that there is a samaya vow not to disparage women as being incapable of buddhahood is in fact proof of the depth of patriarchy and sexism which permeates the Buddhist environment in which Vajrayāna arose.

For example, there are literally hundreds of texts which describe the features of young women (generally between 15 and 25,but in Kalācakra, as young as 12) to be used for partners, the size of their breasts, buttocks and eyes, the shape of their vaginas, their smell, tone of their voice, etc, for use as consorts by men. But I have never seen a similar text for men in which they are analyzed for the size and shape of their penis, and so on, for their suitability to be used as consorts by women.

So ladies and gentleman, let us not pretend that Buddhism in general has not expressed itself historically as a patriarchal religion, and in particular, that Vajrayāna (from kriya tantra to anuyoga) does not have obvious and explicit patriarchal features.

This kind of behavior is forbidden by national law, universal law, and natural law. Those who do will fall into the hells no matter who they are. Every one of us must know this.

People cannot be oblivious to the basic responsibilities of human beings, otherwise we cannot even compare to animals. Notice how animals do not engage in homosexual behavior. Some may argue that same-sex lab rats practice homosexuality, but that is because you force these rats. Has anyone confined you so that you are only with those of your sex and make you practice homosexuality? This kind of behavior defies creation; it is wrong. Cultivators must be normal and not psychologically deranged."

You cannot become a man by removing your breasts and sewing on a penis anymore than you can become a woman by taking hormones to grow breasts and castrating yourself. There is, in the women's community, a lot of discussion amongst women-born women about how to accommodate trans-women who will never (in this life) have the gendered experience of experiencing menstruation, childbirth and menopause, for example.

Having said this, I sympathize with people who experience gender dysmorphia, and if they are adults, it is not my job to approve or disapprove of their choices about lifestyle, surgery, and so on.

Nevertheless, Nick's posts on the issues of transgenderism have been largely confined to the trend in some areas to encourage children with gender dysmorphia to explore reassignment surgery. I agree with him that this is wrong headed.
