Content:
ThreeVows said:
I was curious to hear what people believe to be the doctrinal perspective on prayer. Specifically, for instance, hypothetically say that there is an individual who prays to the three jewels with a mind of faith and longing, and they pray, "If I have any wrong views, I pray that they be corrected so that I can realize the nature of mind!"

Doctrinally, would it be considered to be the case that such a prayer would be heard and responded to, in one way or another, by Buddhas or Bodhisattvas?

What if, for example, there was someone who had never encountered Buddhism, and they were in a culture where there was some general idea of a God. This individual wasn't particularly intellectual, but they did have a heart-felt pull towards the Most High, towards the Sublime. And this person sort of vaguely prayed towards this general sense of the Sublime, which maybe they called God, and they said, "I wish to know the Truth, I wish that all wrong views may be removed from my mind!" Would that prayer be heard and responded to by Buddhas and/or Bodhisattvas, even though the person was not formally Buddhist, didn't know anything about Buddhism, etc?

Malcolm wrote:
From one point of view, all religious traditions are vehicles towards liberation, divided only by whether they are vehicles of samsara (the 360 wrong views) or nirvana (the nine yānas).

It is also said that bodhisattvas like Avalokiteśvara manifest as any kind of nonbuddhist teacher, etc., to benefit those who do not have the merit to enter Buddhadharma:

The Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Akṣayamati, “Noble one, there are world realms where the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the Dharma to beings in the form of buddhas. There are world realms where the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the Dharma to beings in the form of bodhisattva mahāsattvas. The bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the Dharma to some beings in the form of a pratyeka­buddha, to some in the form of a śrāvaka, to some in the form of Brahmā, and to some in the form of Śakra. The bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the Dharma to some beings in the form of a gandharva. He teaches the Dharma in the form of a yakṣa to those beings who are to be guided by a yakṣa. He teaches the Dharma in the form of Īśvara to those beings who are to be guided by Īśvara. He teaches the Dharma in the form of Maheśvara to those beings who are to be guided by Maheśvara. He teaches the Dharma in the form of a cakravartin to those beings who are to be guided by a cakravartin. He teaches the Dharma in the form of piśāca to those beings who are to be guided by a piśāca. He teaches the Dharma in the form of Vaiśravaṇa to those beings who are to be guided by Vaiśravaṇa. He teaches the Dharma in the form of a general to those beings who are to be guided by a general. He teaches the Dharma in the form of a brahmin to those beings who are to be guided by a brahmin. He teaches the Dharma in the form of Vajrapāṇi to those beings who are to be guided by Vajrapāṇi

Yes, it is problematic to connect trekcho to Kagyu Mahāmudra in this way.

You can discern why in Longchenpa commentary on the Treasury of Dharmadhātu, in chapter 10, where where he prefaces his presentataion of the method of equipoise in Dzogchen by the distinguishing between "meditation," which includes pretty everything in the nine yānas, as opposed to natural concentration, which he explains is the specific preserve of the Dzogchen tradition.

As for the third empowerment, there is no introduction in the third empowerment, just an experience, which serves the basis for explaining the example gnosis. Whether the fourth is the actual gnosis (path of seeing) or an example gnosis depends on the person.

Ummm, that’s smoke not wind. You’ve just proven my point. There is no sign one can identify to identify a realized person. In Buddha’s day, most people thought he was just another shaved headed shramana.

As one roshi put it in very plain words, what I thought is - is not, what i did not even imagine that is - is. We need thoroughly realized person to talk about kensho, satori, sho, etc. and I do not mean 'talk' in terms of conversation or arguments.
Otherwise we may also easily play down even historical Buddha and claim, that bodhi he showed is whatever, and fianlly not important, and give our own limited interpretations. Scholars are able to do such thingss. We may easily neglect all struggle Buddha himself had to go through."

C4rl0s said:
I don't know why you have "halfquoted" me - maybe I'm not explaint rightly- but acting in that way, I think we may lost the main point of this thread, it would be, if someone pretends to talk the genuine Soto Zen, then this individual must explain what understand of genuine Soto Zen, i. e., what she understands - you, Matylda - about the Dogen's perspective of zazen, of Buddhism.


Malcolm wrote:
Matylda’ s point, for quite some time and very consistently, has been that you won’t find genuine Soto merely by reading Dogen and practicing what one thinks he means by shikantaza. You will only find it by working with a realized teacher and that the transmission of realization in Soto has been lost in the past 100 years or so.

She has asserted that there are no realized teachers of Soto Zen in Japan today that she knows of, that Soto has become lost in Dogen scholasticism and rhetorical posturing about practice = realization, etc. To the extent that Dogen scholasticism and rhetoric is reproduced amongst American exponents of Soto, one can infer she doesn’t think it’s likely there are any realized American Soto teachers either.

I am also concerned regarding my impression that it is a whole lot easier to get dharma transmission in soto than in rinzai (I know, different terms, processes, etc. but I am sure people can catch the drift here).

Matylda said:
Yes that is true. In soto basically every priest has dharma transmission. But it is also true in Chinese zen as far as I know from Chinese monks and nuns.

Genjo Conan said:
Are we talking about Japan or the US, here?  It is not true that, in the US, "basically every priest has dharma transmission."

Malcolm wrote:
What I find most significant about this system of ecclesiastical grades is that dharma transmission provides access to only a relatively low grade. It is listed as a requirement for the very lowest ecclesiastical status, that of an instructor third class (santo kyoshi). Thus, in present day Soto Zen, dharma transmission constitutes a preliminary step, after which one’s real develop- ment begins. The relatively low status of dharma transmission means that in and of itself it does not qualify one to accept students or to train disciples. According to the regulations, Zen students should be supervised only by a teacher who has attained supervisory certification (i.e., sanzen dojo shike status), that is, someone who in the popular literature might be called a Zen master. To attain supervisory certification requires not just high ecclesiastical grades and dharma seniority but also at least three years’ experience as an assistant su- pervisor at a specially designated training hall (tokubetsu sodo), during which time one undergoes an apprenticeship. This monastic apprenticeship agrees with the popular image of Zen Buddhism as a form of extreme asceticism. The popular image, however, reflects only a limited view of Zen life. These training halls are found at only about one hundred of the nearly 14,000 temples that constitute the modern Soto school. The vast majority of Soto Zen religious activities occur not at the training halls but at the local temples.
Today, the key authority conferred by dharma transmission is that it qualifies a priest to manage an ordinary (jun hochi) local temple.

Bodiford,

And:

While dharma transmission has never been restricted exclusively to clergy, it always has been controlled by ordained members of the clergy, that is, by people who receive rites of ordination, shave their heads, and wear Bud- dhist robes. Within this group, dharma transmission always has been a matter of insider knowledge, discussed only by the clerical elite, who themselves have been initiated into a dharma lineage. For ordinary lay people, in contrast, the much more obvious public social distinction bestowed by ordination always has been of prime importance, since it is the people with shaved heads and Buddhist robes who can generate karmic merit for the laity by accepting their gifts. At Zen Centers in North America, however, a lay-clerical distinction based on gift giving (by laity) and generating merit (by priests) is all but meaningless. Most people see Zen (especially sitting Zen or zazen) as a form of self-realization or relaxation exercises that lay people can practice as well as (or better than) clerics.43 Within this context, lay practitioners who might care nothing about priestly status can, nonetheless, become very concerned about dharma transmission, who has it and who does not. From conversations among practitioners at different Zen Centers, it seems each Center has developed its own individual culture of dharma transmission: here it might signify eligi- bility to join a Center’s board of directors, there it might mark completion of a koan curriculum, and somewhere else it might be seen as equivalent to clerical ordination, and so forth.
These variations in the social significance assigned to dharma transmis- sion highlight the unsettled state of North American Zen communities. Differences in their respective histories, founders, economic circumstances, and facilities have imbued each Zen Center with its own distinctive culture and idiosyncrasies. The Dharma Heritage Ceremony serves to remind Soto priests from these dissimilar Centers of the collective tradition they share. It provides a common ritual in which all of them can participate simultaneously, jointly offer homage to the founders of one another’s lineages, and formally acknowledge one another as religious peers.44 Clearly, it is designed to help foster the development of a new shared culture of dharma transmission. Each of the individual elements within the ceremony (the setting, musical instru- ments, processions, prostrations, circumambulations, prostrations, chants, and so forth) consist of standard Zen ritual practices as performed at Buddhist temples in Japan. The ceremony as a whole, its format and sequence as well as its emphasis on mutual affirmation, however, presents something new and uniquely American. Significantly, it concludes with all the participants chanting the Zen hymn known as the Harmony of Difference and Sameness, a title that aptly expresses the goal of the ceremony itself and the task now faced by the SZBA.45 Thus, the ceremony represents a development of traditional ritual forms for new purposes in a new land. It is a development that reflects both the growing maturity of Zen traditions in North America and their precarious, difficult quest to harmonize imported and native, old and new, similar and different.

Bodiford,

Just for context….

Hi Matylda

Matylda said:
"We should be critical of soto, rinzai and obaku whenever they loose their essense. They are not immune and godly untouchable systems of practice and experience. The name soto etc. does not give to anyone diplomatic immunity. It is us, humans who run the show, and if we miss the point, we should be at least informed about it."

C4rl0s said:
Yes. And, precisely, if we dont want to miss the point, and we actually talk about a genuine Zen, a genuinue Soto Zen in this case, we must do it standing for a right perspective of Dôgen.
I think the next famous passage from Genjōkōan - recall this was the first chapter of Shôbôgenzô in the earliest version - is truly enlightenment about that (quoted from BDK version):

"To learn Buddha's truth is to learn ourselves. To learn ourselves is to forget ourselves. To forget ourselves is to be experienced by the myriad of dharma. To be experienced by the myriad of dharma is to let our body and mind, and the body and mind of the external world, fall away. There is a state in which traces of realization is forgotten; and it manifests the traces of forgotten realization for a long, long time."

Note not only learning is importance, but also forgetting. Learning and forgetting are like our two legs; if we want walk, we cant do it just with only one of them at all. Learning and forgetting are decisive not only in Shôbôgenzô, but also in Zen, as well as in Buddha's Way.

Finally, kensho is not about someone who has seen something than others haven't seen it. Kensho is about seeing we must not give up our practice not even a lapse of time.



Malcolm wrote:
I think, if you read carefully, Matylda is saying that you won’t find what Dogen was talking about in any of Dogen’s writings, which according to her, have no bearing on the question of realization in the Soto School, as she understands it, since, as I understand what she is saying, what Dogen was talking about is only found in the interaction between teacher and student, and not in any books.

She has been quite adamant on the point that realization on Soto is dead. She has also suggested that Soto needs to be revived by a blood transfusion from Rinzai.

The situation in American Zen is even stranger, with whole lines of teachers and their students to whom they have conferred inka having conflicts with one another, or so I have heard.

No, I cited the half of the paragraph. I did not cut off any sentences. Here is another extract from the following paragraph:

The Zen school—members of the Rinzai, Sōtō, and Ōbaku lineages—is regarded as being foremost among them all. In recent times, however, the Zen schools have been engaging in the practice of “silent illumination,” doing nothing but sitting lifelessly like wooden blocks. What, aside from that, do you suppose they consider their most urgent concern? Well, they witter on about being “men of nobility” who have “nothing at all to do.” They proceed to live up to that self-proclaimed role. Consuming lots of good rice. Passing day after day in a state of seated sleep. The surplice and cotton robe they wear as Buddhist priests is no more than a disguise.

Ekaku, Hakuin. Wild Ivy (p. 2). Shambhala. Kindle Edition.

Or how about these  paragraphs:

But for the past hundred years, ever since the passing of National Master Gudō,4 advocates of blind, withered-up, silent illumination Zen have appeared within the Rinzai, Sōtō, and Ōbaku schools. In spots all over the country, they band together, flicking their fingers contemptuously, pishing and pughing: “Great satori eighteen times! Small satoris beyond count! Pah! It’s ridiculous. If you’re enlightened, you’re enlightened. If you’re not, you’re not. For a human being, the severing of the life-root that frees you from the clutches of birth-and-death is the single great matter. How can you count the number of times it happens—as if it were a case of diarrhea! 

“Ta-hui made statements like that because he was ignorant of the supreme, sublime Zen that is to be found at the highest reaches of attainment. Supreme Zen, at the highest reaches, does not belong to a dimension that human understanding of any kind can grasp or perceive. It is a matter of simply being Buddhas the way we are right now—‘covered bowls of plain unvarnished wood.’ It is the state of great happiness and peace, the great liberation. Put a stop to all the chasing and hankering in your mind. Do not interfere or poke around after anything whatever. That mind-free state detached from all thought is the complete and ultimate attainment.” 

These people, true to their words, do not do a single thing. They engage in no act of religious practice; they don’t develop a shred of wisdom. They just waste their lives dozing idly away like comatose badgers, useless to their contemporaries while they live, completely forgotten after they die. They aren’t capable of leaving behind even a syllable of their own to repay the profound debt they owe to the Buddha patriarchs.

The other one was within the ranks and had 3rd or so position at honzan but was critical of monastery authenticity of practice and warned my friend not to stay there for long and adviced him a soto master who used koans.
But koan or shikna taza is not the issue I think, but genuity of ones realization, whatever way of zazen one follows.

So though there were very few individuals, they kept away from the official soto, or were very critical of it. So these few examples were no match for shumucho bureaucracy or sholardom of Komazawa, those two big powers which shape soto zen in Japan for last 100 years. So those few had no influence on soto whatsoever.

My subjective experience is no Christian I have ever met and discussed this with has believed in a young earth or taken every word in the Bible literally.  Fundamentalists of all stripes hold a minority view in my experience.

Join us as we examine dating methods, fossils, and dinosaurs from a biblical worldview. The evidence from a biblical worldview clearly shows that the earth is young, and Noah’s global flood buried organisms creating the vast majority of fossils just a few thousand years ago.

Taking the talking rabbits in the Jatakas, and so on, literally, is about on the same level as this.

Śāriputra: Goddess, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?163
Goddess: Although I have sought my “female state” for these twelve years, [F.213.a] I have not yet found it. Reverend Śāriputra, if a magician were to incarnate a woman by magic, would you ask her, “What prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?”
6.­33
Śāriputra: No! Such a woman would not really exist, so what would there be to transform?
Goddess: Just so, reverend Śāriputra, all things do not really exist. Now, would you think, “What prevents one whose nature is that of a magical incarnation from transforming herself out of her female state?”
6.­34
Thereupon, the goddess employed her magical power to cause the elder Śāriputra to appear in her form and to cause herself to appear in his form. Then the goddess, transformed into Śāriputra, said to Śāriputra, transformed into a goddess, “Reverend Śāriputra, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?”
And Śāriputra, transformed into the goddess, replied, “I no longer appear in the form of a male! My body has changed into the body of a woman! I do not know what to transform!”
6.­35
The goddess continued, “If the elder could again change out of the female state, then all women could also change out of their female states. All women appear in the form of women in just the same way as the elder appears in the form of a woman. While they are not women in reality, they appear in the form of women. With this in mind, the Buddha said, ‘In all things, there is neither male nor female.’ ”
6.­36
Then, the goddess released her magical power and each returned to their ordinary form. She then said to him, “Reverend Śāriputra, what have you done with your female form?”
Śāriputra: I neither made it nor did I change it.
Goddess: Just so, all things are neither made nor changed, and that they are not made and not changed, that is the teaching of the Buddha.

Aśvaghoṣa’s detailed description of the Buddha’s father as an ideal Brahmanical king contrasts sharply with other contemporary biographies of the Buddha. The Mahāvastu, for all its length, has very little to say about Śuddhodana’s accomplishments as a king. And the Lalitavistara presents him as an ideal Buddhist king, without using any Brahmanical terminology.41 Indeed, it would seem that Aśvaghoṣa has himself invented the elaborate descriptions of the ideal kingship of the Buddha’s father, perhaps with the conscious purpose of glorifying Brahmanical notions.

Nah, it just substitutes one unwieldy theory of karma and its ripening for another one.

If a vasana merely reproduces itself in the mind stream, waiting to meet special condition for the arising of its result, this is similar to asserting that a rice seed merely reproduces itself until it meets water, mud, and sunshine.

If one asserts the trace itself remains in the mindstream unchanged, one has to then create a theory of how that trace exists in the mind as something carried by the mind. This latter theory is slightly more preferable, according to Nagārjuna, it's based on the Buddha's comment that karma is like a debt that exists until it is paid. But even this theory won't hold up to analysis. So in the end we are left with the the fact that karma is just an illusion created by an illusion, just as Nagārjuna states in the MMK.

Edit: The guest would have already eaten seven fish, a lizard, some sour milk, and a few mangos, so rabbit stew would be course number 5 and he would likely have to barf up some of what he head eaten up to that point to make room for it. Also, the rabbit was apparently teaching the dharma which it would be unable to continue doing after killing itself. All in all, the meaning of the story seems to actually contradict the dharma.

Don't tell him!"  When our laughter had subsided, he said simply, "It's not that satori is unimportant, but it's not the part of Zen that needs to be stressed."

ZMBM, at p. ix (2011 ed.)
He never denied satori.  It's just that, according to Suzuki, a focus on satori--how do we get there?  Am I doing it right? How long is it going to take?--is unhelpful and probably counterproductive.  His focus was rather on how we live our lives.  My dharma grandfather was one of Suzuki's students and once asked him "what is nirvana?"  Suzuki's response was: "to see one thing through completely to the end."

Apparently you do not know why he was addicted to heroin. Crowley had extremely severe asthma, life-threateningly so. It was progressive and got worse as he aged. Until the Germans invented a medicine for controlling asthma in the early 20's, everyone with asthma as severe as his took heroin to control it. In fact, once that medicine was available to Crowley, he stopped taking heroin altogether until, in 1939, when WWII broke out, and this medicine was no longer available in Britain. So he, and many other people returned to using prescription heroin:

In 1898, Bayer & Co. introduced heroin as a pain reliever and cough suppressant. The company packaged and sold the drug in bottles like this one. Its amber glass and colorful label presented the newly commercialized product “Heroin” to customers as an effective, safe treatment. While stronger and cheaper than morphine, heroin is also more addictive. An Englishman discovered the drug’s compound in 1875. However, 20 years passed before German chemist and Bayer employee Felix Hoffmann synthesized it into heroin. Hoffmann also created aspirin, a groundbreaking medication that is still widely used today.

So, to the extent that Soto Zen teachers--and again, there are some--deprecate awakening experiences (whether we want to call them kensho or something else), like I wrote earlier, I find that hard to square with the history of the school and with basic Mahayana doctrine.  My own belief--and this is what my teachers have taught me--is that Soto and Rinzai differ principally on method and outlook, not in the belief that awakening is the aspiration.


Malcolm wrote:
It appears to me that the whole issue actually is grounded around which source texts were considered acceptable by Dogen. I don't know enough about how the Platform Sutra was received in Japanese Zen as a whole, but I assume it is quite accepted by many. Maybe Meido could shed some light on this.

A question for you: how you understand the role of the Platform Sutra in your school? And perhaps Meido, Matylda, and Astus could weigh in here. When it is boiled down, it really seems that what is at issue is this text.


Genjo Conan said:
I think bodhicitta is the heart of Mahayana practice.  Without bodhicitta, I'm not sure what we're doing here.  I think that's just as true in Soto Zen as it is in any other branch of the Mahayana.  Dogen certainly believed so.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, bodhicitta is one of the three sublimities, as we call it: the first is relative bodhicitta, the aspiration to awaken; the second is ultimate bodhicitta, the union of śamatha and vipaśyanā, and the third is dedication. This is the essence of all Mahāyāna practice, including Dzogchen.

"Seeing the mind and seeing the nature (見性) is the animated activity of non-Buddhists."
(Sansuigyo, SBGZ, vol 1, p 219, BDK Edition; https://21dzk.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/SAT2015/T2582_.82.0063b27:0063b28.cit )

"Some fellow has said, “Old Man Śākyamuni, besides expounding the teaching and the sutras throughout his life, also authentically transmitted to Mahākāśyapa the Dharma of the one mind which is the supreme vehicle, and this transmission has passed from rightful successor to rightful successor. So the teaching is opportunistic idle discussion, but the mind is the essential true reality. This authentically transmitted one mind is called ‘the separate transmission outside the teachings.’ It is not to be likened to discussion of the three vehicles and the twelve divisions of the teaching. Because the one mind is the supreme vehicle, we speak of ‘direct pointing into the human heart’ and ‘seeing the nature (見性) and becoming buddha.’” This expression is never about the everyday conduct of the Buddha-Dharma: it lacks the vigorous road of getting the body free, and it has no dignified behavior throughout the body. Fellows like this, even hundreds or thousands of years ago, were proclaiming themselves to be leading authorities; but we should know that, if they had such talk as this, they neither clarified nor penetrated the Buddha’sDharma and the Buddha’s truth."
(Bukkyo, SBGZ, vol 2, p 70, BDK Edition; http://21dzk.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/SAT2015/T2582_.82.0107a13:0107a26.cit )

"The essence of the Buddha-Dharma is never seeing the nature (見性). Where has any of the Seven Buddhas or the twenty-eight patriarchs of India said that the Buddha-Dharma is only “seeing the nature” (見性)? The Sixth Patriarch’s Platform Sutra contains the words “seeing the nature,” (見性) but that text is a fake text; it is not the writing of one to whom the Dharma treasury was transmitted, and it is not the words of Sōkei. It is a text upon which descendants of the Buddhist Patriarch absolutely never rely."
(Shizen-biku, SBGZ, vol 4, p 269, BDK Edition; https://21dzk.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/SAT2015/T2582_.82.0298b23:0298b29.cit )

It is interesting to learn that Dogen rejected the Platform Sutra.

An interesting corollary is that Sakya Paṇdita also rejected the idea of "seeing the nature of the mind" as a non-buddhist system, linked to his rejection of the Single White Remedy advanced by Lama Shang, etc.

Sapan and Dogen lived at the same time.

Genjo Conan said:
Again, commonly attributed to the Daruma Shu--and, according to Faure, to Tendai as well, with which Dogen was intimately familiar.
The kensho jobutsu theory advocated by Hui-neng in the Platform Sutra and by Shen-hui had been transmitted in the Tendai tradition (for example, in Saichos Kechimyakufu and in Daruma Daishi Sanron), and constituted the theme of Kensho Jobutsuron, one of the Daruma-shū's treatises.


Bernard Faure, The Daruma-shū, Dōgen, and Sōtō Zen, at n.60 (1987), available here: http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/DogenStudies/DarumaShu_Dogen_Soto.html#note60

I don't speak Japanese, so if Matylda wants to argue with the scholarship, I'm out of my league.  But that's the scholarship.

Malcolm wrote:
So, really, the root of the dispute is that not the Dogen rejected awakening, (obviously), he rejected a subitist term from a text he considered forged, one of the seminal texts of the entire Chan/Zen tradition. And in reading the rest of Faure's article, Dogen was critical of the Chinese founder of Rinzai as well.

Natan said:
It's the definition that matters. In credible translations, pristine awareness is often used. And there's no problem, because an author like Longchenpa devotes entire treatises to it's elucidation. The word brilliance could have been used instead with no problems. Even if one relies on archaic Indian terms, the specific use must be fleshed out. What Vidya means for one Indian tradition, has nothing to do with how it's meant in another. An Indophile preference doesn't seem helpful, nor does an attitude of "only this way and no other." If best translations are sought, knowledge, science, lucidity, cognizance and so forth can be used, but these hardly shed light on Vidya as used in Vajrayana teachings, let alone the elaborations made by Tibetans and their use of Rigpa which takes on very specific and even anatomical significance. For my money, of we are talking about concepts which have only Tibetan source materials, then, if the preference is for original terms, use Rigpa. Again what this word means among the various lineages of Tibet varies significantly. Just from my own organic growth trajectory, not interacting with many folks for a long time, I used Bindu or Bindi, plural. That seemed to wrap up all the permutations of meanings for me. I'm vary suspicious of anyone who is inflexible and has a my way or no way mentality.

natusake said:
The word literally means "knowledge". Adding "pristine" is interpretive at best, and plainly additive at worst. "Awareness" has already been criticized in this thread, and I haven't observed any compelling argument in its favor so far. Longchenpa explains that rigpa is a contraction of the phrase "one's own knowledge of pristine consciousness (yeshe)".

As I understand it, the equivalence between vidya and rigpa as terms comes from translation standards established in the transmission of Buddhist texts from India to Tibet. As Buddhists have the idea that our source material is Indic, whether evidence on a text-critical/historical basis for this is produced, as far as our own tradition and lineage is concerned I think it is appropriate to back translate technical terms into Sanskrit.

Natan said:
Whose tradition and lineage is that?

Malcolm wrote:
He is talking about a common term, from Hinayana though Dzogchen. In Sanskrit, pratyatmyavedanajñāna, so so rang gi rig pa'i ye shes. Gnosis which is personally known to oneself. This is literally how it is defined in all Buddhist traditions, and specifically, in chapter 1 of the Choying Dzod Commentary, Longchenpa asserts that the term "rig pa" is a contraction of so so rang gi rig pa'i ye shes, and so is rang rig.

"Pristine" because of "ye nas" which is a synonym of primordial, and so on. The word "primordial" is quite overused in Dzogchen translations. It's lazy and often grammatically incorrect, depending on which part of the sentence it belongs.

Natan said:
None of these words are going to call up an entrance to experience of Dzogchen without the kind of textual output someone like Longchenpa provides,

Title: Tasting Sugar

Malcolm wrote:
This post was conceived elsewhere, but it is being born here:

clyde said:
There are a few Zen teachers who have publicly spoken about their kensho/satori, including Meido (Rinzai) and Guo Gu (Chan), but a more open and honest discussion of Zen teachers and students regarding realization would be controversial - but would be revitalizing.

Malcolm wrote:
The issues you raise, Clyde, are not just in Zen. The issues you raise are endemic in Western Budddhism. Why? In general if you make light of yourself, in Asia everyone will think maybe you have depth you are hiding. In America, and to a lesser extent in Europe, if you don't loudly proclaim who you are, set out your achievements and qualifications, if you tell people that you really don't have any qualities, Western people, especially Americans, will believe you and move on. There is a saying in Tibet, "An empty bucket makes the most noise."

It's really easy to talk about sugar to someone who has not tasted it. You can use all kinds of words. However none of them will permit the person to have insight into what it tastes like. And worse, people can use these words to deceive those who have never tasted sugar (including themselves) into believing that the person describing sugar (which they have never tasted) has actually tasted sugar, selling sugar substitutes, such as saccharine and aspartame.

Ordinary students who have never tasted sugar will never be able tell who has tasted sugar just because some teacher with a name proclaims everywhere, "I have tasted sugar!" advertising their retreats and seminars to the Tricyle/Lion's Roar/ Patreon/Wisdom/Shambhala audience. There is no guarantee that such a person who is advertising some brand of sugar has actually tasted the sugar they are selling, even when they claim someone else signed off on their sales license. Realization, whatever word you use for it, kensho, satori, rig pa, is not something which one can successfully discuss with people who do not have that experience. If one is not a teacher, one should not really try to either.

People who have had that experience recognize that trying to convey this experience in words is fraught with peril, that it can be misleading. Meido mentions this in his brief discourse on kensho, offering a disclaimer to those listening, by saying that it is easier to say what kensho isn't then what it is:

https://www.patreon.com/posts/about-kensho-46557679

All I can say is that those who have tasted sugar can identify those who have not tasted sugar by how the latter describe it to the former. When two people who have tasted sugar get together however, they don't really need to say very much at all to recognize each other.

For example, in the Tibetan Dzogchen tradition, it is traditionally kept very secret. Why? Not because of national security, not because it is a trade secret, and not because it is reserved for a special, elite grade of practitioners. Dzogchen has been kept secret, because like Zen, it is not realizable through intellectual analysis--it is experiential from beginning to end. And it is very easy to see in discussions who has some realization of Dzogchen teachings and who doesn't. The problem is that people can deceive others by using words and concepts found in Dzogchen texts, and the same applies to Zen/'Chan, Mahāmudra, etc. They can fool people with lineages, titles, status, certifications, and large retinues.

There is also no guarantee that a person who has tasted sugar is going to be someone we like, someone we can relate to, someone who makes us comfortable and relieves our stress. It's very likely quite the opposite, that person will make us feel very uncomfortable, and we will have a hard time relating to that person. Why? Because the job of such a person is to show us our own state, and just as everyone hates the sound of their own voice, looking at our own state is not comfortable.

Sometimes students feel that when a teacher goes out of the way to make them feel uncomfortable, acts strangely, and so on, this is "crazy wisdom". There are many so-called teachers who hide behind unconventional behavior because they have no realization at all. Its all just Dharma business, and making students feel unbalanced, insecure, and afraid is often the best way to gaslight them.

But a real teacher who is making us feel uncomfortable, out of our zone, does not need to do anything obviously outrageous, all they need to do is keep telling us, "That's not sugar," "Nope, that's not sugar either," until we discover what sugar actually tastes like. Sometimes helping us taste sugar feels very extreme, causes us to have doubts about what we are doing.

Then finally, say someone has satori, kensho, discovers rigpa, identifies the nature of the mind. So what? This is the beginning of the actual path. Now they actually have something to work with other than confusion. Now they have less doubt. But if they do not have a qualified teacher, someone who has actually tasted sugar, then they will never know if they have tasted sugar or instead tasted saccharine or aspartame.  Anyone who has tasted sugar immediately knows that saccharine, aspartame, while both sweet, taste nothing like sugar. But working with such a teacher is a two way street. The teacher has to trust the student, otherwise, they may not feel comfortable if the student is just a kind of dharma junkie, go to this teacher and that teacher, this teacher and tradition, chasing concepts and not gnosis. So in this case the teacher may not open up right away, show their hand as someone who actually has been tasting sugar for some time. See, it is not enough to taste sugar once. One has to make sure. One has to also sample sugar against sugar substitutes so one can make sure.

The point is very simple, how does anyone know anyone is realized? There is certainly no way for an ordinary student to tell. This being the case, how are we to know who is a realized Zen master, Lama, etc? It’s not like there is some external sign or verbal indication of realization. This is why lineage is more important than the individual teacher, and that’s true in every authentic Buddhist tradition.

Given the number of Japanese Zen teachers who have proven to be absolute shitshows in America, and who have “confirmed “ their students, not to mention Tibetans, Koreans, and so on, even the safeguard of lineage is questionable.

In reality, one puts away silly romantic ideas about realized teachers, finds a compatible person to study and practice with who at least has a valid lineage, and you follow the Dharma, not the person: the meaning, not the words; definitive texts rather than provisional ones; and gnosis rather than concepts, as the Buddha recommended.

The overarching conclusion of this book is that the causes of the conflict were deep and remain persistent. Therefore, resolving it will be difficult. When Radoslaw Sikorski criticized “Russia’s 19th century approach” to security in 2013,16 he made an important point: Russia seeks an order based on the dominance of the great powers that was widely accepted in the era prior to World War I. The West rejects this idea, insisting instead on an order based on a combination of democracy and international institutions. That disagreement emerged from the moment that Mikhail Gorbachev was loosening the Soviet Union’s control over central Europe in 1989. Russia’s deployment of force in 2014 can be viewed as a determination to no longer accept the results of a set of rules it did not endorse. Ending the conflict will require, and will likely help shape, a new set of security arrangements in Europe. Until Russia accepts the West’s vision for Europe or the West accepts Russia’s, the conflict will endure, with Ukraine caught in the middle.

The only reason Putin felt impunity about attacking Ukraine is because they had no nuclear weapons, and he had already frustrated their attempt to join the EU and NATO in 2008 and again in 2013-2014.

Because of Putin's attack on Ukraine, NATO has in the last year admitted two countries that have been historically neutral for decades: Finland and Sweden. Putin has succeeded only in strengthening NATO.

Personally, I support Ukraine %100 percent in their fight against the genocidal ambitions of Putin. Putin is destroying his own country to fight a war he has no hope of winning, whether or not he decides to use nuclear weapons.

As for Taiwan. The PRC just likes to saber rattle. Right now China is in the middle of a huge economic crisis, with 20% unemployment, rampant inflation, etc. They are not going to go to war against Taiwan anytime soon. If they do, they too will lose.

Further, Dosho Port writes:


Unknown said:
When the Meiji Soto reformers first began collaborating with each other to determine what they could identify as the central practice they offered householders (in order both to shore up their congregations and hopefully convert some of those at the gates who were carrying torches), you might be surprised that "shikantaza" did not come up. And it didn't come up as a practice for householders until much later, possibly with Sawaki Roshi (1880-1965).

In the first such efforts to convey what Soto Zen was about, the venerable monks simply highlighted the goal and avoided specifying any method. Significantly, they identified that goal as awakening (“directly pointing to the mind, seeing into one’s nature and becoming Buddha” they said) and did not hesitate to use the words "kensho" and "satori." These had not yet become taboo in the new Soto School.

At that time, some in Soto Zen were enamored with Western Protestant Christianity and set about to reform Soto Zen in its image, in part by centering householders rather than monastics (as had been the case throughout Soto history in China and Japan). It was also at this time that the Soto school's emphasis on kensho and/or satori were dropped because the consensus was that it required an intensity of training that householders (and arsonists) were not up for. It was only much later that the avoidance of the word "kensho" was blamed on Dogen having a personal issue with the word (which he did)…

Rather than a path of vivid practice verification, the PMSO only offers to meet people's belonging needs, a trivialized and truncated dharma belief system, lots of ceremony, and a little zazen. Ironically, today in the West, most Soto practitioners, as well as most Soto teachers, seem to unknowingly embrace what they think is the "Soto Tradition" and "Dogen's Way," when, in fact, what they are embracing is a recently reformulated religion, born in part from the trauma of the "abolish Buddhism, destroy Shakyamuni" campaigns as well as Western colonialism, and repackaged in a wrapping much like what many of them fled - Protestant Christianity.

" Cheah draws from critical race theory to illuminate a legacy of Orientalism and white supremacy from the Western Orientalists of the Victorian era to the contemporary Vipassana movement. Cheah borrows from Lori Pierce to define white supremacy as “the conscious or unconscious promotion and advancement of the beliefs, practices, values and ideals of Euroamerican White culture, especially when those cultural values are represented as normal.”95 As a largely invisible hegemonic discourse, white supremacy operates as a standard of normality in convert lineages. For example, bell hooks has discussed how African Americans feel marginalized in white convert communities, and for some, participating within them “has been synonymous with choosing whiteness.”96 Both Cheah and hooks argue that white supremacy, as an unconscious cultural discourse, has largely shaped Euro-American convert communities. 

Crucial to Cheah’s argument is the distinction made by Michael Omi and Howard Winant between cultural and racial rearticulation.97 Cheah extends their work to define “cultural rearticulation” as “a way of representing religious tradition from another’s culture into ideas and practices that are familiar and meaningful to people of one’s own culture.”98 Such a process is inevitable when religions travel across cultural contexts, and examples from Buddhist history include the sinicization of Buddhism in China.

I think you need to think about this in relation to your dialogue with Matylda. Specifically, she is critiquing the Zen that came to America as a trend that grew out of the Buddhism Modernism period in Japan. She is pointing out, that in her opinion, what passes for Zen in the West, largely has nothing to with actual Zen, by and large.

Robert Sharf offers a close examination of the historical and ideological emergence of New Buddhism, the distinctively Japanese iteration of Buddhist modernism.36 The early years of the Meiji period (1868–1912) witnessed dramatic political and cultural changes and rapid modernization and industrialization. Against this backdrop, Shinto government officials mounted a strong campaign called “abolishing Buddhism” against the Tokugawa Buddhist establishment. They accused Japanese Buddhism of being both antimodern—institutionally corrupt, superstitious, and holding Japan back from scientific advancement—and anti nationalist—a foreign religious import that did not reflect the innate cultural and spiritual sensibilities of the Japanese.37 

In response to the dual challenges of Shinto government opposition and Western discourses of modernity, a group of elite, university-educated Japanese Buddhists fashioned a distinctively modern form of Buddhism. They admitted that Buddhism had become corrupt but attributed this to institutional and cultural accretions that had distorted the pure spiritual core of the tradition. In what came to be known as the New Buddhism, reformers presented a picture of a pure Buddhism that was rational, empirical, and compatible with modern science and social reform...

Sharf points out that the typically cosmopolitan and intellectual proponents of New Buddhism were educated at universities that were highly influenced by modern Western discourses, and he identifies the determinative influence of Romantic critiques of institutional religion and Enlightenment values of universalism, science, and reason.40 He claims, for example, that the framing of Zen as “pure experience” reflected the understanding in the works of Friedrich Schleiermacher, Rudolph Otto, and William James of the core of religion as a sui generis unmediated experience. This Western-influenced reconstruction of Zen as pure spirituality was then presented to unsuspecting Westerners as an historically authentic picture of Zen, which, moreover, was claimed to be superior to Christianity. According to Sharf, therefore, Meiji Buddhist reform figures subversively appropriated key values of Western modernity to form a modern picture of Zen that was used to challenge the religious and cultural hegemony of the West.41 

Sharf has shown that the New Buddhism was distinct from traditional or classical Zen on multiple levels. He disputes the notion of a “pure experience” that can be uncoupled from its institutional and doctrinal constraints, noting that classical Zen is one of the most scholastic and ritualistic forms of Buddhist monasticism and that enlightenment in Zen is “constituted in elaborately choreographed and eminently public ritual performance.”42 He has also questioned the legitimacy of New Buddhist proponents, pointing out that they were largely laypeople who were not trained in traditional Zen monastic settings. Nonetheless, this modernist vision of Zen was largely embraced by Western scholars and lay practitioners as an historically accurate picture of traditional Zen until recent studies such as Sharf’s illuminated its specifically modernist and nationalist contextual origins.43
Gleig, Ann. American Dharma . Yale University Press. Kindle Edition.

This "modern picture of Zen that...used to challenge the religious and cultural hegemony of the West" was imported to the West, and because it was largely informed by Western ideals, "This Western-influenced reconstruction of Zen as pure spirituality was then presented to unsuspecting Westerners as an historically authentic picture of Zen."

experience and awareness of experience are two different things. For example. We experience a moist surface on the eyes, as well as blinking, but we have No awareness of it. And except perhaps where damaged or scarred, we experience every inch of the surface of our skin constantly. Even the backs of our knees and tops of our ears. But we are just so used to these continuous things, these very subtle sensations, that we are simply not aware of them unless for some reason they are interrupted. For example, by touching hot or cold or sharp.
We are experiencing brain activity constantly but we experience it as ideas, thoughts, dreams, and so on. We have no direct awareness of neurons firing. We are only aware of how we interpret those physiological experiences.

Malcolm wrote:
I would argue it is not the case that experience and awareness are phenomenologically distinct. If we are color-blind for example, we cannot experience certain colors. so we are not aware of them. Same goes for certain kinds of deafness.

Zen and the Art of Saving the Planet by Thich Nhat Hanh (2021) is a worthwhile book with some odd aspects.

The general reader is likely to read it "as is", as a book by TNH with commentaries from one of his senior students. As such, it is wise, gentle and positive, as is everything I know by this teacher. He argues that the only way to have a positive effect on the world is to work from a position of universal compassion, and the way to reach that position is mindfulness practice.

Malcolm wrote:
Mindfulness, these days, has been sewn up in a neat neoliberal packaging:

One of the claims made by mindfulness advocates is that the practice in and of itself leads to pro-social conduct, enhancing compassion, altruism and empathy, while reducing aggression and prejudice. This is one of the movement’s central tenets, used to justify the absence of any overt discussion of ethics. It is the basis of the utopian promise that a mindful revolution will usher in a more humane society and even world peace.

Purser, Ronald E. . McMindfulness (p. 122). Watkins Media. Kindle Edition.

Hopefully, what people will understand from this book instead, though I doubt it, is this:

Instead of despairing at the ravages of capitalism, or clinging to myths about its instant destruction, we can be liberated moment to moment by meaningful action. This is powerful because it reverses our dismembering by neoliberalism, which leaves us divided to fend for ourselves in a cutthroat environment, erasing our collective memory in the process. It is hardly surprising that so many feel hopeless, passive, and cynical. We need to re-member — to come back together, to recall what has happened, and to cultivate what Bhikkhu Bodhi calls “conscientious compassion,” awakening new visions: 

A collective voice might emerge that could well set in motion the forces needed to articulate and embody a new paradigm rooted in the intrinsic dignity of the person and the interdependence of all life on Earth. Such collaboration could serve to promote the alternative values that offer sane alternatives to our free-market imperatives of corporatism, exploitation, extraction, consumerism, and toxic economic growth.32

Purser, Ronald E. . McMindfulness (pp. 259-260). Watkins Media. Kindle Edition.

What i think people are going to see is this:

The Davos crowd, already well versed in managing assets, tends to view human behavior in terms of economic motivations. Mindfulness framed as a skill just becomes a new way to invest in human capital. The entrepreneurial self is encouraged to make this wise investment so as to gain a competitive edge as an economic actor. This reduces the self to a “collection of assets that must be continually invested in, nurtured, managed and developed,” warns Wendy Brown in Undoing the Demos, making resistance far less likely.14 It can be hard to see out of the box if the system that builds it is reinforced by mindfulness, suggesting we can thrive if we only let go of awkward questions.

Purser, Ronald E. . McMindfulness (pp. 174-175). Watkins Media. Kindle Edition.

Further, that no-one can do it alone and that, to be most effective, we need to form or join  communities consciously working for change. None of this is particularly specific to "saving the planet", and environmental activism as such is hardly mentioned in the middle half of the book.
But if our hypothetical general reader takes it all in and applies it, they will be a better and happier person by the end of it, having painlessly absorbed a solid course of Engaged Zen. And then, we hope, they are ready to go on saving the planet.

Malcolm wrote:
I’m unconvinced that humans will exist in a thousand years without radical changes.

As for changing the pluto- cratic control of government, finance, and the media by corporations — or ending unemployment, inequality, homelessness, substance abuse, or white supremacy — it seems almost mean to suggest that paying attention will wave magic wands. 

Ironically, Kabat-Zinn’s ideas about future deliverance distract us from what the present most requires of us: political engagement. As the University of Chicago’s Lauren Berlant notes: “Optimism is cruel when the object/scene that ignites a sense of possibility actually makes it impossible to attain the expansive transformation for which a person or a people risks striving.”5 Dissent is often stifled by fixation on the moment, letting go of “doing,” and thoughts about action. Instead, we are told to retreat to unstable conditions, indulging in what Berlant calls “conventional good-life fantasies.” Mindfulness is all very well as a basic coping device, but as a revolutionary strategy it seems empty, tempting its adherents with the comforting impasse of passivity.

Perhaps the point is, that in the context of Dzogchen, awareness is non-referential..

Malcolm wrote:
In the context of English, the term refers to being vigilant:

Middle English aware, from late Old English gewær "watchful, vigilant," from Proto-Germanic *ga-waraz (source also of Old Saxon giwar, Middle Dutch gheware, Old High German giwar, German gewahr), from *ga-, intensive prefix, + *waraz "wary, cautious" (from PIE root *wer- (3) "perceive, watch out for").

This is quite far from the preferable translation of rig pa as "cognizance:"

cognizance (n.)
mid-14c., conisance, "device or mark by which something or someone is known," from Anglo-French conysance "recognition," later, "knowledge," from Old French conoissance "acquaintance, recognition; knowledge, wisdom" (Modern French connaissance), from past participle of conoistre "to know," from Latin cognoscere "to get to know, recognize," from assimilated form of com "together" (see co-) + gnoscere "to know" (from PIE root *gno- "to know").

Meaning "knowledge by observation or notice, understanding, information" is from c. 1400. In law, "the exercise of jurisdiction, the right to try a case" (mid-15c.). Meaning "acknowledgment, admission" is from 1560s. The -g- was restored in English spelling 15c. and has gradually affected the pronunciation, which was always "con-." The old pronunciation lingered longest in legal use.

kirtu said:
Just to stir the pot some more, I suspect, although I have no solid evidence, that in fact Early Indian Vajrayana did have a notion of tulku's, so identified or identifiable nirmanakayas although the Tibetans extended this by creating lineages.
What we now group together as Hinduism developed the concept of an avatar between the 5-2th BCE - 6 CE:
The concept of avatars was first introduced in the post-Vedic literature, particularly the Bhagavad-Gita of the epic Mahabharata, the Ramayana, and the Puranas.
Thus the basic concept of an avatar, an incarnation to revitalize the teachings, have this long window dating from around the time of the Buddha all the way up to just after the establishment of Indian Buddhist Vajrayana.

So Indian Buddhism had a model available for nirmanakayas more or less from the start.

Secondly some consider that phowa, transference, was actually mentioned in the Yoga Sutras of Pantajali (around 400 CE):

From The Perfection of Desire as the Path (Kāma-Siddhi) Three Early Indian Vajrayāna Treatises, Jadusingh, Laul (the kind of transference mentioned is into the body of a recently deceased person)
[58]Parapurapraveśa: (lit. entrance into another city”). Sometimes, the Yoga of Resurrection in Another Body, literally, Another City (Skt.nagara/pura-praveśa/ Tib. gron ‘jug) is treated as a separate practice; otherwise, it is included within the Yoga of Consciousness Transference, the last among the Six Yogas of Nāropa....This is a practice also described in the Yoga Sutras of Patañjali (Vibhūti Pada, 37). Therein, it is explained that the yogī who knows the course of the network of nerves (nāḍi-sañcara) can project his consciousness into another body and by nagivating the course of the network of consciousness-conveying nerves (chititavāha-nāḍī) in that body, establish his own consciousness therein.
So the concepts themselves arise in what became Hinduism around the time of Buddhist Vajrayana in India historically and predate the transmission of Dharma to Tibet and were just laying around to be used/appropriated.

Really?  Is there a real difference here though as Buddhist Vajrayana yogis associated with one another in charnel grounds and other places and we clearly have what are effectively clans of siddha style practitioners in India today that claim their traditions stem from the 8th century.

Malcolm wrote:
What we don't find is family lineages in the Tibetan style, modeled on the style of brahmins, like the Khon. There wasn't any need for such family lineages in India because of the central role brahmins played in the ritual life of Indians.

The only such kula lineages I am aware of are Shakti family lineages in Hinduism. I suppose there could have been such buddhist family lineages of tantic practitioner in India, but there is no record of them forming distinct institutions like the Ngakpa families of Tibet.

I am always happy to discover new historical information, but I have not seen any on this subject. what we call the tantric period in Indian history was pretty brief, chaotic, with lots of social upheaval. The insitutional base for Vajrayāna Buddhism was destroyed, and frankly, that last practitioners we know of date to the 17th century. Claims by 21st century Bengalis to 1000 year old tantric lineages ought to be met with some suspicion.  It is a little hard to suss out the Naths-- they might have maintained Cakrasamvara secretly, but there is only anecdotal evidence, nothing hard.

What was never the case was recognizing incarnations for the purpose of continuing lineages, which include property, and so on.

Assume your statement is correct that the entire tulku system is corrupt, this begs the question - why such precious teachings entrusted to a corrupt system (by the boddhisattvas, etc)? Why do they say the blessing of the lineage (e.g. there surely is no blessing coming out of a "corrupt system"? Is this also a political statement? What makes Vajrayana work then? Not the "lineage blessings" and devotion/faith?

I’m not sure I follow… I understand the first sentence to mean that relative truth is any object perceived by an ignorant perceiver/awareness. So wouldn’t the emphasis be equally on both subject and object?

Malcolm wrote:
Because a truth is a perception, which is either veridical or not. In Candrakīrit, all objects are defined as having two natures: one the object of a veridical perception, one the object of a nonveridical perception. The Geluks generally define the objects of these two perceptions as isolates in the object. Non-Gelug madhyamakas however do not take the idea that objects have two natures literally, merely that objects can be seen correct or incorrectly. In other words, satyas are perceptions of objects, they do not exist in the objects themselves.

Many realized masters came out of the tulku system. Starting from the most recent: Gyatrul Rinpoche, Dudjom Rinpoche, the 16th Karmapa … going all the way back to the early tulku system, the list is too long.

There have some tulkus who practiced and attained realization. but being recognized a tulku by itself is not a guarantor that the person is realized. And below the seventh bhumi bodhisattvas completely lose all memory of their realization, and so have to start all over again at the beginning in every life time.

And at least one famous tulku, the 5th Dalai Lama, wrote in his autobiography that he failed the tulku exam. Despite this, the regent claimed he passed. So, I remain completely skeptical. It's a corrupt system and has been forever.

Corrupt systems often seem to be thriving from a worldly point of view.

I have been researching neuroscience and dissociation. Would the state of awareness, from a neuroscience perspective, be similar to the state of dissociation? Although similar, it doesn't mean they are the same, as the doctrine of dependent origination prevents a person from disconnecting from convential reality.

On that, there is this passage found within the Upa Tantras:


"If [the yogin] recites in the night, he will be pure and have no hindrance. That drug will change and will emit circular light and will be bright in the midnight or at sunrise. If the mantrayanist takes the drug, he will wander in space. He will have longevity and great prestige. He will be free in life and death. He will go to the summit of the world and will manifest various forms. The meritorious and auspicious man will offer to one Buddha after another. Many things are produced by the mantra. Such is called siddhi (accomplishment) non-discrimination (siddhi in non-form) - all will be accomplished by the discriminated drugs".

Then again, it’s possible that Rongzompa didn’t say that “…views of Sutra such as Madhyamaka were inferior to that of Tantra”; but just that he had critiqued a specific interpretation of Madhyamaka.

I’m just taking it on faith that the above statement is in the said book translated by Heidi Koppl, and that she did not mistranslate what he originally wrote.

Malcolm wrote:
She didn't, and when Rongzom was alive Candrakīrti was just being translated into Tibetan, and had yet to exercise the impact the latter had on Tibetan scholars. However, in the opinion of later Nyingma scholars, Rongzom would not have rejected Candrakīrti's madhyamaka. The Madhyamaka he was rejecting is very similar to Tsongkhapa's formulation.

That's correct.  This is the view of the Buddhist teachings themselves, those of the Buddha and all bodhisattvas and buddhas after him, and the whole traditional history of the Dharma.

Malcolm wrote:
"The Buddha" is a broad term. Not every Buddhist sūtra was spoken the Buddha, and the inner tantras are definitely not teachings of the historical Buddha, unlike the lower tantras.

For example, Śākyamuni Buddha did not explain Guhyasamaja to Indrabhuti I. He merely manifested the mandala and bestowed the empowerment. The same goes for the Hevajra Tantra, although in this case some Indians held that he taught the Hevajra tantras while in the form of Hevajra, Of course, being in the form of Hevajra means one is not a nirmāṇakāya.

And in point of fact, Sákyamuni never taught the Cakrsamvara tantra. It was taught by Buddha Vajradhara long before the time of Śākyamuni to Vajrasattva, thence to Vajrapani, who gave it to Saraha I. Likewise, the Dzogchen tantras were never taught by Śākyamuni, the latter merely predicted their arrival, etc.

And all of these are "just so stories," without any historical fact to base them upon.

So, we cannot be promiscuous with the notion, "Taught by the Buddha." One has to be precise. Not only this, but texts are not the real tantra anyway.

Anyway, I am sure you will be banned again for being a complete pain in the ass with your dogmatic obsessions, just like all the other times you chose to register under a new nym and start a fight with me.

In addition the Muslim (barbarian) invasions towards India, were a 10th/11th century event that go unnoticed by the other HYTs from the earlier centuries like secret assembly, etc. Earlier anuttarayoga tantras were silent on that matter and do not contain the same prophecies about a Messiah like figure unlike the prophecy in Kalachakra which is a sign/display of Buddhists reacting to their time and circumstances.

Indra's Bow said:
the Samantabhadra state predating the separation of the Dharma Realm into samsara and nirvana, hence preceding the start of the operation of the initial causal link of ignorance and all its consequent effects leading to this whole mass of suffering.


Malcolm wrote:
Common mistake here: Samantabhadra also possessed the so-called ignorance of the same identical cause and the connate ignorance.

The divide between samsara and nirvana happens with the third ignorance, the imputing ignorance. This is also the beginning of the delusion, the formation of the all-basis, the operation of the six intellects. This third ignorance, the cause of delusion is what Samantabhadra was never subjected to. This distinction is made because there is a) nonafflictive ignorance, which is a knowledge obscuration, and b) afflictive ignorance, which is the afflictive obscuration, and the actual start of the twelve nidanas.

Thus, in every moment, we have the possibility to avoid the third ignorance, and realize the state of Samantanbhadra.

Whether we like it or not, liberation is clearly not a result of positive karma, and cannot be impeded by negative karma. If liberation could be impeded by negative karma, no one could ever attain liberation because we have gathered far more negative karma than positive karma from beginningless time.

Malcolm wrote:
Again with the Christian thing.

Karma cannot be absolved. Buddha did not absolve Angulimala of killing hundreds of people. Karma either ripens or it does not. In Angulimala’s case, he was never going to take birth in samsara again. If he were, he would have necessarily experienced the ripening of those actions.

As for the bardo, if you don’t accept rebirth, it doesn’t matter. But if you don’t accept rebirth, karma doesn’t matter either. Also liberation does not matter.  And it’s strange you even consider yourself a Buddhist if you don’t accept rebirth, and so on.

I personally accept rebirth, based inference, etc. YMMV. Based on that acceptance, I take seriously the idea that most Dzogchen practitioners are liberated in the bardo and that everyone who enters the door of Dzogchen teachings attains liberation, again, YMMV.

That’s hilarious. We are talking about someone who had the best Dzogchen teachers on the planet, who spent tons of time with all of them, who had total faith and devotion to Dzogchen teachings. Sure, Sogyal embarrassed himself, was sybaritic, pompous, and had many other apparent faults. That has nothing to do with his opportunity for liberation in the bardo, or his practice while he was alive.

He also sponsored more teachers to come to the west than anyone else. I’d stack up that fact against his “ethical breaches” any day. He did more for the Dharma in Europe than you or I will ever do. The same goes for Trungpa. So stop being so arrogant and judgmental.

Sure. But, in those stories, we were always told the end result that revealed the benovelant intentions of the bodhisattvas or the happy endings for the people involved. Although I try not to make conclusive statements as I don't have the full facts, most of the offences committed by the modern-day teachers in the West (either by Tibetan or western teachers) appear to only have negative or very damaging effects to other people, which we can the question whether they were "skillful means" or just plain wrong.

Malcolm wrote:

More than that, are we really certain that in terms of karma, the “offenses” these teachers are supposed to have committed did not in fact remove many obstacles from the paths of their “victims,” shortening the paths of the latter by eons?

It’s quite narrow minded to pretend we have any real insight into the workings of positive and negative karma of this teacher and that teacher, this student and that student, given that the activity of karma spreads out over eons and countless lifetimes. We have all been every terrible being and benevolent being, perpetrator and victim alike.

No one forces us to take teachings from anyone. But we should exercise caution before deciding to commit ourselves to a negative view of people like Trungpa and Sogyal.

The doctrine of dependent arising via the links of ignorance through old age, sickness and death isn't itself a contemplation of nonarising; quite the opposite - it considers exactly how conditioned phenomena do arise, abide, change and cease.

Malcolm wrote:
That really depends on how one perceives dependent origination. When one understands the real meaning of arising from conditions, one understands nonarising. This is why it is said in the PP Sutra in 2000 lines, "Whatever arises in dependence, in reality, that does not arise."

Its also why Nāgārjuna states:

I pay homage to the best of teachers,
the perfect Buddha, by whom dependent origination—
neither ceasing nor arising, 
neither annihilated nor permanent,
neither going nor coming,
neither different nor identical—
was taught as peace to pacify proliferation.

You have to keep in mind: most people in Vajradhātu had very little personal interaction with Trungpa. The organization was and is very hierarchical, and particularly after 1976, when someone brought a gun to one of his public talks in Boulder and started waving it around, student interaction with Trungpa became more ceremonial in nature, as Trungpa surrounded himself with guards, valets, and so on.

But this is all ancient history. Trungpa passed away in 1987, and he would not recognize the organization he left behind.

The Buddha taught the truth of the causes of our agitation and the path to serenity and freedom. In forty years, I have yet to find anything strictly requiring “belief” that is not, in a sense or at least to some degree, optional.

In other words, there’s very little in the vast collection of Buddhist texts that one needs to really be concerned with if it doesn’t lead to realization. You don’t need to believe that there’s a literal Mount Meru, or Buddhist hells, or even other realms if it doesn’t help you.
Their descriptions are customized for the way we humans grasp concepts anyway.

At the same time, at some point they may become obvious and you won’t need to “believe” in them then any more than you now “believe” you have eyeballs (which you have never seen directly!). You will be fully confident in what you know.

Indra's Bow said:
In the Abhidharmasamuccaya, for instance, the entire chapter of teaching on the Noble Truth of Suffering is cast in the mold of the impermanence of the universe as it is revealed and described by the Buddha and his offspring.  Without this insight, according to this text, and instead, say, holding to the popular views of nihilism, one cannot get a right view of the Truth of Suffering.  In this way, it follows that one must of necessity have the correct view of all of the Abhidharma, both that of psychology, morality, meditation, etc., as well as the nature of the external world, in order to properly understand the Noble Truth uniquely taught by the Buddha.  By this logic, with a heretical or nihilist view, one wouldn't be able to actually enter into the stream of awakening by penetrating into the Truth of Suffering.  It would follow then by the foregoing that it might be considered crucial that one embrace all of the Buddha's and Bodhisattvas' teaching as being accurate and true, both regarding mind and the physical external realm, since otherwise one would have misunderstood the meaning of the teaching and not realised the (Noble) Truth which cannot be heard anywhere in the threefold world outside of the Buddha's dispensation.

Malcolm wrote:
No, it is not necessary to embrace the precise model presented in the Abhidharmasamuccaya to understand that the beings in the universe arises from causes of affliction and karma. One can understand the general principle to be correct without subscribing the particulars in every instance. And one can enter Buddhadharma without necessarily accepting any kind of belief, provided that one correctly understand that the Buddha's teaching is focused on ending rebirth in samsara, since that indeed is liberation.

Malcolm wrote:
I do not think this is fair assessment. He coined the term quite early, and while he certainly related the concept to Padmasambhava's role as a teacher trying to tame Tibetans, and by inference, what it takes to tame savage westerners, if you read his two seminal seminars on the idea, it's much more related to Dzogchen. Specifically, he related Dorje Drollo to discovering that one's primordial state is beyond being harmed by negative deeds or benefited by positive deeds.

For example, he explicitly says in his book that "crazy wisdom" is not part of the mahāmudra tradition:

Student: Has the crazy-wisdom teaching developed in any lineages other than the Nyingma lineage? 

Trungpa Rinpoche: I don’t think so. There is also the mahamudra lineage, which is based on a sense of precision and accuracy. But the crazy-wisdom lineage that I received from my guru seems to have much more potency. It is somewhat illogical—some people might find the sense of not knowing how to relate with it quite threatening. It seems to be connected with the Nyingma tradition and the maha ati lineage exclusively.

Trungpa, Chögyam. Crazy Wisdom (Dharma Ocean) . Shambhala. Kindle Edition.

You see, in Nyingma there are four classes of manifestation: peaceful, semi-wrathful, wrathful, and crazy. Only Dorje Drollo really qualifies for the last category. The practice of Drollo is very much related to the eight classes which cause so much trouble today, which makes it perhaps among the most effective yidam practices for the modern era, as I have asserted before. To practice Drollo, one really has to go beyond hope and fear.

Yes, and let’s continue to the end of that same paragraph: From this profound point of view, spiritual practice does not provide comfortable answers to pain or confusion. On the contrary, painful emotions can be appreciated as a challenging opportunity for new discovery. In particular, the author discusses meditation as a practical way to uncover one's own innate wisdom.
The point is, whether fresh and sparkly or drunk and stinky, is to keep the mind from settling into an ego trip.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, since the mind is already settled into an ego trip, I think the point is to dislodge it.

In any case, the book is pretty precise about what Trungpa meant when he coined the term. For example:

In the case of the primordial craziness of crazy wisdom, we do not permit ourselves to get seduced by passion or aroused by aggression at all. We relate with these experiences as they are, and if anything comes up in the midst of that complete ordinariness and begins to make itself into a big deal, then we cut it down—without any special reference to what is good and what is bad.

Trungpa, Chögyam. Crazy Wisdom (Dharma Ocean) . Shambhala. Kindle Edition.

So really, Trungpa's intent was that one use crazy wisdom for oneself. It has been poorly misunderstood to be something that teachers use with students.

As it relates to relating with students, he says:

The essence of crazy wisdom is that you have no strategized programs or ideals anymore at all. You are just open. Whatever students present, you just react accordingly.

Trungpa, Chögyam. Crazy Wisdom (Dharma Ocean) . Shambhala. Kindle Edition.

And of course, ultimately, for Trungpa, crazy wisdom means to be beyond hope and fear:

Until we realize the true implication of hopelessness, we have no chance of understanding crazy wisdom at all, ladies and gentlemen.

Trungpa, Chögyam. Crazy Wisdom (Dharma Ocean) . Shambhala. Kindle Edition.

Honestly, its his best book.

"Crazy wisdom", along with having such a high level of realization that he was unharmed by all that booze while the rest of us would not cope.

I guess he was right about the last seven words above.

Diana claims Trungpa inherited the "crazy wisdom lineage" from Khenpo Gangshar, who perhaps could be graced with the epithet of "crazy wisdom", although, afaik, while he did take a consort and did drop monastic vows, he did not exactly adopt a life of luxury!!!

First of all, I disagree because before the BuddhaDharma I met the theory of the trutis and it was explained to my surprise how water element emerges from the fire element. It happens via condensation of vibration.
You can't do philosophy on examples that are already set as true. Trying to be a theoretician, you abandon the path, remember? And not only that, but you deny the observation.

Then you quote an even bigger thing, If names and so on are not fixed,
then the separate actions of the elements could switch.
No, this does not happen. Name is assigned to meaning. A name is assigned to designate. In the context of the theory of trutis, elements can be arbitrarily named, but they'll keep their meaning/qualities. You could give wrong names, but behind the name there are fixed qualities. I refer only to the theory here. The meaning fixes the name. It's from the inside out, not the other way around!
Since this does not separate name and meaning at all
Well, you've been prevented from doing it by way of necessity.

The reason the retreats in it are short, etc., is because it is a practice designed for busy physicians. But this does not apply to other people. Why? Because the YN is intended for people of great merit and little time. Other peoples time is better spent receiving teachings in Longchen Nyinthig, Dudjom Tersar, and so on.

The primary role of the YN these days is drupchens for blessing medicine.

It's more common than you might imagine. It's not necessarily a red flag, however. Some lamas only wish to devote their time to students who are dedicated to one practice lineage. Quite honestly, if someone came to me and explicitly said, "I want to learn about Dzogchen, but I really prefer keep practicing x," I'd say, "You're wasting both of our time. The teachings are not something we study just for idle interest. Come back when you are serious about Dzogchen teachings and are interested in making them your primary focus."

"All" means all. Everything we do in this life, apart from practicing the dharma, is pointless and just causes us to continue in samsara. Therefore, in order to make our life meaningful, we practice the dharma. In other words, life is meaningless, but dharma makes it meaningful. The example is a dream, since no matter what we do in a dream, good or bad, when we wake up, we understand that it was all meaningless, just a dream.

While waiting for his plate of meat loaf, gravy, and an iceberg wedge at an empty restaurant in Concord, New Hampshire, on the first day of June, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was gently explaining to me that nobody knows whether HIV is the sole cause of AIDS…


Kennedy crowed to me about his horseshoe coalition gathered round a campaign he views as fundamentally populist. And it’s quite a band he has put together: crunchy Whole Foods–shopping anti-vaxxers, paunchy architects of hard-right authoritarianism looking to boost a chaos agent, Nader-Stein third-party perma-gremlins, some Kennedy-family superfans, and rich tech bros seeking a lone wolf to legitimize them. Their convening can give the impression of weightiness, but if you so much as blew on them, the alliance would shatter into a million pieces. The only thing that seems to bind them is Kennedy, the current embodiment of a warped fantasy of marginalization and martyrdom that has become ever more appealing — and thus politically significant — in an age of disinformation and distrust in government and institutions…

Kennedy has also suggested that 5G high-speed-internet towers are being used to “harvest our data and control our behavior”; posited a link between mass shootings and antidepressant use; told Rogan that Wi-Fi pierces “the blood-brain barrier,” causing “leaky brain”; and claimed the presence of atrazine in the water supply has contributed to depression and gender dysphoria among boys since atrazine is known to clinically castrate frogs when dumped into their tanks.

Kennedy called Tucker Carlson “breathtakingly courageous.” This spring, he posted a photo of himself with far-right activist James O’Keefe, who has used deceptively edited videos as attack vehicles against ACORN, Planned Parenthood, and NPR..

Now his brain trust appears to be the hyperonline, hard-right masculinity influencers who give him the approval he craves and encourage him to do things like post videos of himself shirtless, his chest and arms improbably pumped, doing nine janky push-ups…

But this country, with its political system built around white patriarchal ideals of who powerful men are supposed to be, and its very limited view of what other kinds of power might look like, has created too irresistible an opportunity for someone with a famous name, a tremendous ego, and a persecution complex. So here we are, eight years after Trump descended the elevator in Trump Tower, listening to a man talking about ivermectin and the fascism of Fauci and the castration of frogs and watching him run riot in a Democratic primary.

As Orwell observes:

Pacifism is objectively pro-Fascist. This is elementary common sense. If you hamper the war effort of one side you automatically help that of the other. Nor is there any real way of remaining outside such a war as the present one. In practice, ‘he that is not with me is against me’. The idea that you can somehow remain aloof from and superior to the struggle, while living on food which British sailors have to risk their lives to bring you, is a bourgeois illusion bred of money and security. Mr Savage remarks that ‘according to this type of reasoning, a German or Japanese pacifist would be “objectively pro-British”.’ But of course he would be! That is why pacifist activities are not permitted in those countries (in both of them the penalty is, or can be, beheading) while both the Germans and the Japanese do all they can to encourage the spread of pacifism in British and American territories.
https://www.orwell.ru/library/articles/pacifism/english/e_patw

The same holds true today. This is why Putin and co. are trying as hard as they can to encourage isolationist sentiments among Americans and Europeans, but punish their own citizens when they protest Russia's "special military operation" with long prison sentences.

Would Kennedy be a disaster for America? I believe so. He says he accepts climate change but doesn't know if carbon is to blame... that's enough in itself for me to completely discount him. This is the most important crisis the world is currently facing, and he is unclear on the basic science, nevermind having policy ideas to try and mitigate it.

Malcolm wrote:
He is unclear about basic science in its entirety, so it seems. And he thinks climate change is going to create a pretext for all kinds of dystopian outcomes, without realizing climate change is the dystopian outcome future generations are going to to deal with for the next 1000 years, assuming the human race lasts that long.

The real problem with the RFKjr. candidacy is that his platform in many respects seems good, but it begins with a conspiracy theory: that the US Government is against the people.

Secondly, his nod to climate change on his campaign website is "the weather is wacky." This is not a serious climate change mitigation policy. Nor are his ideas about agricultural remediation, which seem to be taken from Joel Salatan books.

His healh care plan seems to hinge on legitimizing quacks like Mercola: "A Kennedy administration will go beyond making existing modalities available to all, to include low-cost alternative and holistic therapies that have been marginalized in a pharma-dominated system." There is a reason most alternative health care is not insurable: they do not produce consistent, measurable outcomes for patients. The basic attitude is fine, there are serious problems with the industrial medicine complex, but sorting healthcare for Americans is not something to be fixed by feelgood "You can see your sound healer and we will pay for it" solutions. And, tellingly, there is no mention of Universal Healthcare in his platform. Healthcare is not something that can be managed well by the market:

Bristollad said:
Social insurance cannot be applied to only small parts of the workforce because it then naturally leads to adverse selection, a point well illustrated by the endless wrangles over health care coverage in the United States. If it is possible to opt out, anyone who thinks they may not require the insurance (for example, the rich, those unlikely to be unemployed, or healthy people) will do so, since they do not want to subsidize the “others.” A system that relies only on the “others” is unsustainable because of the huge premiums it would require. Thus, the welfare state can work only when it covers all, or almost all, of the labor force or all citizens.

Globalization erodes these requirements. Trade globalization has led, in most Western countries, to a decline in the share of the middle class and its relative income. This has produced income polarization: there are more people at the two ends of the income distribution and fewer around the median. With income polarization, the rich come to realize that they are better off creating their own private systems because sharing a mass system with those who are substantially poorer and face different risks (such as a higher probability of unemployment or of certain diseases) would lead to sizeable income transfers from the rich.

Private systems also provide better quality for the rich (per unit of expense) because they allow savings for the types of risks that the rich do not face. If very few among the rich smoke or are obese, they do not have an incentive to pay for the health care of smokers or obese people. This leads to a system of social separatism, reflected in the growing importance of private health plans, private education, and private pensions. Once these private systems are created, the rich are increasingly unwilling to pay high taxes because they benefit little from them. This in turn leads to erosion of the tax base. The bottom line is that a very unequal, or polarized, society cannot easily maintain an extensive welfare state.

The cost of labor is a barrier to manufacture of many goods such as IPhones in the US, etc. This sort of isolationism is naive.

Kennedy also erroneously claims the US dollar's position as the world's reserve currency is threatened. By what? The RMB? Give me a break. The Chinese economy is in rapid decline. They are freaking out because they cannot maintain the 5.5% growth rate they've targeted. https://www.foreignaffairs.com/china/how-chinas-economic-slowdown-could-hurt-world #

He is also an advocate of the world's great grift in history: cryptocurrency. This shit is just a ponzi scheme. What a fool.

His foreign policy solutions are equally inadequate, in that they are nonexistent. His idea—which of course is stupid in this climate of international uncertainty—is to eviscerate the US armed forces, withdraw from the international security agreements we have made, and defund the military. The oft recited figure of "800" bases ignores the fact that the majority of these "bases" are manned by less than 50 personnel and most of these are manned by less than 20 personnel. Most of the large ones are in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East, and if he thinks those should be dismantled, he should have his head examined.

His platform makes no mention of the State Department. If he were a serious person about foreign policy, he would be running on platform of increasing the number of career foreign service officers and beefing up State, as well as providing more funding for the CIA, NSA, and our other intelligence services.

His civil liberties platform also features a conspiracy theory, "in which Big Tech censors, deplatforms, shadowbans, and algorithmically suppresses any person or opinion the government asks them to." This is laughable bullshit. He is just butt hurt because he traffics in lies and conspiracy theories, and Yahoo, etc. don't want to support his bullshit. He has plenty of outlets where he can spew whatever crap he wants to: Rumble, Telegram, Twitch, etc. "Big Tech" is a number of private companies, and particularly in the light of the (absurd) SCOTUS ruling on websites the other day, they just don't have to give him a platform at all.

He also clearly does not have a firm grasp of the history of pandemics in this country, nor does he understand  vaccination, the need for quarantine in pandemics, etc. The rest of it is just pandering nonsense as well.

A stable Russia, with good foreign relations, is essential. If you think a weak and cornered nuclear power is a good idea, you need to stop drinking all that wine you're collecting and spend some more time in retreat.
A stable Russia, at this point in history, is an impossibility for as long as Putin in power. Russia is the very definition of a kleptocracy. It is run by criminal gangs. Russia needs to be isolated and contained until Russia shows it can play well with others. This likely requires a change in regime.

Russia is not cornered at all. They keep playing the nuke card, but they have been doing so for more than two decades, and they know quite well no one survives, despite the nihilistic pronouncements by Russian State Television hosts. If you think that Russia is actually going to use nuclear weapons, then you are mad to think there is any negotiated peace to be had.

There is no scenario where Russia employs even tactical nukes. 1) It would do nothing to halt the advance of UAF. 2) Such a use would be regarded as terrorism since there are no legitimate targets against which Russia could use such a bomb—Ukraine has no nuclear weapons—and would automatically trigger Article 5, since any use of nuclear weapons anywhere on the European continent would be regarded as an attack on NATO.

Putin just made another aggressive adventure. and rather than the world sitting idly by as they did before, he got called out for his blunder. There is no scenario where Ukraine settles for anything less than a complete Russia withdrawal to pre-2014 borders. All deaths in the "Special Military Operation," no matter which side, are blood on Putin's hands and no one else.

But he famously said, “The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.” When Russia began losing, (which was immediately), all of sudden you people decided this was a proxy war initiated by the United States, because we all could not understand that a) how incompetent the Russian Army actually was and b) how much experience the Ukrainians had gained in fighting the initial invasion of Eastern Ukraine in 2014.

Yes, whatever stops the killing. The whole situation is at something of a stalemate, and the rest of Ukraine and its young men face continued destruction so long as the West want it to. Zelensky was elected on the promise of ending the war (which actually started in 2014), and he was pushed into becoming a wartime president by both Putin and the West; they're stuck in the middle of a pitiful great power conflict, and there are no signs of anyone coming out of this any the wiser or better off. Despite that, Ukraine is in quite a strong position at the moment, and it's absolutely not clear that Ukraine will have to yield any territory after rounds of negotiations and peace talks. There is no all-or-nothing ending to this war unless nukes are involved.

Malcolm wrote:
Your advocacy of offensive realism does not hold up, however. One of Mearshiermer's students, John Owen, points out the inconsistencies of Mearshiemer's thesis:

Zhen Li said:
lthough Putin’s invasion of Ukraine certainly is a reaction to NATO expansion, it won’t do to say that the war is therefore the West’s fault. The flaw in the thinking of Mearsheimer, Walt, and other academic realists is that they present an inconsistent view of how international relations works. Mearsheimer, for example, is no more entitled to say that the West caused the war by expanding NATO than he is to say that Russia caused the West to expand NATO by being weak. A fuller explanation for the war takes into account the ideological differences between authoritarian Russia and the democratic West...

Realists generally agree that “international anarchy,” or the absence of a world government to punish aggression and enforce agreements, forces states to take steps to defend themselves. Mearsheimer’s version, called offensive realism, says that the quest for security leads states to expand their power as far as is prudent. A consistent offensive realist argument would have to say that the United States agreed to take more allies in Europe because it could – because Russia was too weak to oppose it. Walt’s version of realism, called balance-of-threat theory, is more complicated: It says that states expand their power when other states become more powerful and display evidence of offensive intent. A consistent balance-of-threat explanation would say that it was a powerful and menacing Russia that produced NATO expansion. Neither version of realism can assign any moral blame to either America or NATO.

But neither Walt nor Mearsheimer applies his own theory to NATO expansion. In fact, both think their theories fail to explain it, and both appeal to a different theory. The United States and its democratic allies, they claim, are captive to liberal ideology, a jumble of ideals and wishful thinking that has propelled them into foolhardy behavior that has provoked a Russian backlash. NATO governments have deluded themselves into seeing their alliance not as the tool of American power that it is, but as a vehicle of freedom and democracy whose eastward march could only be opposed by wicked or paranoid people.

Mearsheimer and Walt have written elsewhere that the United States has been in thrall to the ideology of “liberal hegemony” since 1991. They admit, then, that the United States – the greatest of the world’s great powers, and hence the country that realism should best explain – confronts their own theory with an anomaly three decades long and counting. That is a serious problem for them. Realism also claims that the international system punishes imprudent behavior, meaning that it should discipline America for acting as if it dwells in a liberal utopia. The West, then, should correct course and behave as realism predicts. But the international system has been unaccountably merciful. Judging from the West’s unified support of Ukraine over Russia in the war, it is going to be in thrall to liberal ideology for a while longer.

Malcolm wrote:
You can read the rest yourself. Instead what we see is that the international system is punishing Russia for its imprudent behavior. Even China, post-Prighozhin, is now backing away from Russia and openly acknowledging Ukraine's claim to Westphalian Sovereignty. The Ukrainians will not back down. They are an independent people, with their own language, customs and so on. Peace will only come when Russia withdraws to pre-2014 borders.

NATO war or further escalation with either Russia or China or pushing them into further escalation against us is beyond insanity.

Vajrasvapna said:
No, and in fact, there is much in Dzogchen literature that renders this assertion baseless, and nothing to support it apart from post 17th century syncretic apologetics.
Dzogchen concepts have a clear ground in Yogacara concepts.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, no they do not, actually. The whole reason Mañjuśrīmitra wrote his Cultivation of Bodhicitta was to distinguish Dzogchen from Yogacāra. His ultimate argument refuting Yogacāra is this:

Never separate from the momentary location, at that time, they are mutual;
without one, [the other] does not exist.
Traces do not exist  because they are generated by false concepts.
The all-basis does not exist because its experiential sphere does not exist. Also, those cognitions are nonexistent.
If the supporting [traces] and the location do not exist because partiality does not exist, how can consciousness and cognition arise? 
Therefore this mind too is beyond the extremes of existence and nonexistence, and is free from being one or many. 

[Mipham's comment] 

The momentary all-basis that is the location of the traces and the traces themselves are never separate. When one does not exist, it is necessary that the other does not exist. At that time, without one, the other is impossible. Both their existence and nonexistence are mutual. When those traces do not exist, also that all-basis does not exist, like a result without a cause.

If it is asked, “While that may indeed be the case, why do the traces not exist?,” since traces do not correspond with how those entities exist because they are generated by false concepts, the traces do not exist. If the traces do not exist, since the domain of the all-basis is the traces, its experiential range does not exist. Due to its nonexistence, the all-basis does not exist. If the object of clinging does not exist, all those cognitions do not exist because the consciousness will not exist. 

When both the supporting traces do not exist and the all-basis, the location where they exist, does not exist because the partialities do not exist as shown above, how can consciousness and cognition based on those arise? Therefore, not existing in any way, this mind and its mental factors are beyond the extremes of existence and nonexistence, and are free from being one or many.

Further, the commentary in the Soaring Garuda, one of the five early lungs, states:

In order to demonstrate the deviation and obscurations of vijñaptimatra: [7/a]

Delusion and the path of awakening cannot be obtained with concepts.

Because atiyoga is true, undeluded about everything, the vijñāptimatra understanding of things as reflections of delusion and the view attained through that is a conceptual imputation of their own. Due to their not seeing this, Smelting the Gold in the Ore states:

Seeing phenomena as delusion is itself fully understood to be delusional.

Nonsense:

In short, I was frustrated by the constant lies and distortions about the work of US Embassy Kyiv during the 2013–2014 Euromaidan Revolution—and these lies were coming from the Russian state apparatus. Russian government statements and high-volume, confident Russian media invective constantly implored publics worldwide to believe that the US Embassy was the secret but decisive force behind the Ukrainian protest movement, plotting to thwart Russia’s interests in its own backyard in some sort of geopolitical maneuver. Their distorted mirror presented the Ukrainians as pawns, legitimate Russian interests as innocent targets, and the United States as a hostile interloper with motivations somewhere between a satanic jackal and a cartoonish horror movie villain. None of this was true, and it congealed into a foundational lie upon which propagandists built fresh new sedimentary layers of deceit. Today in Russia, the falsehood that the United States had some pivotal role in supporting, funding, or even creating Euromaidan as a cynical maneuver against Russia is treated as established truth beyond question. Stacked on top of this were mistruths about Ukraine being run by “fascists,” separatists in eastern Ukraine being local and organic, and much, much more. But having served there at the time in US Embassy Kyiv, I was shocked to realize that many people worldwide believed these crude propaganda hooks.

According to many sūtras, Pāpīyān Māra and his army were quite conclusively converted to protect the Dharma. If there was such a being, it seems like he's no longer a threat, but in the Mahāsaṃnipāta, it talks about how there are still plenty of other māras around.

Zhen Li said:
The Perfection of Wisdom literature often uses some variation on the phrase "māraḥ pāpīyān avatāraṃ na labhate" (Pāpīyān Māra does not obtain entry) in reference to overcoming Māra's deeds. Phrasing along the lines of "avatāraṃ na labhate" is used elsewhere in reference to other devas. This is used in the context of someone practicing the Dharma suddenly having thoughts of abandoning it, or otherwise being disturbed during practice with fiendish ideas. Chapter 11 of the Aṣṭasāhasrikā, for example, suggests that when a bodhisattva is practising the copying of the Perfection of Wisdom, Māra will come and make him think of all sorts of distracting things, sorrows, troubles, about themselves, hateful, greedy, ignorant thoughts, etc. While "Mārakarma" (deeds of māras) also refers to misunderstandings of the Perfection of Wisdom or Dharma (and one can take this figuratively), it also refers to these kinds of thoughts inserted (entered) into the minds of a practitioner.

This sounds a lot like the experience of intrusive thoughts, so I posted this topic in the "wellness" forum since this does fit into the category of mental wellness. Lee Baer's The Imp of the Mind defines this as follows (as paraphrased on Wiki): "Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times, and generally have aggressive, sexual, or blasphemous themes." Baer says in Chapter 7 of his book that with religious people, this appears to be associated with an OCD closely linked to fear about blasphemy and damnation—St. Ignatius, for instance, was extremely obsessive about committing minor blasphemies such as stepping on straw in fear that it might be in the form of a cross, and also experienced severe cases of intrusive thoughts. It doesn't seem to be the case (as I suspected) that Christians identify the phenomenon as demons or other spirits, however Fred Penzel (on Wiki) suggests that "thoughts of being possessed" are among common intrusive thoughts among the religious. That is of course entirely different from what the Aṣṭa is suggesting: it is not that the person's thought that "Māra is gaining entry to my mind" is the intrusive thought, but that one has intrusive thoughts, and this is interpreted as something caused by Māra (or māras). I think the Buddhist case here might be describing a unique interpretation.

I discussed this with Dharma friends and most of them also said that they experienced some form of "non-Dharmic" unwanted thought that disrupts their practice. Even as a kind of management strategy, I personally found acknowledging that such thoughts are not "mine" (whether or not they are inserted by another being, Buddhist thought holds that to be true) helps significantly in ignoring them and getting back to practice. In a group of about eight, only one was surprised that we would have such thoughts during a Dharma service or practice—so this phenomenon might be more common than might be expected. I think a poll is appropriate to get some sense of whether other Buddhist practitioners have experienced this phenomenon.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, that's true because of corporate socialism. The subsidies energy companies get to produce natural gas and oil are appalling:

Globally, fossil fuel subsidies are were $5.9 trillion or 6.8 percent of GDP in 2020 and are expected to increase to 7.4 percent of GDP in 2025 as the share of fuel consumption in emerging markets (where price gaps are generally larger) continues to climb. Just 8 percent of the 2020 subsidy reflects undercharging for supply costs (explicit subsidies) and 92 percent for undercharging for environmental costs and foregone consumption taxes (implicit subsidies).

https://www.imf.org/en/Topics/climate-change/energy-subsidies

2017 numbers for the US:

These were dominated by subsidies to fossil fuels, which account for around 70% (USD 447 billion) of the total. Subsidies to renewable power generation technologies account for around 20 % of total energy sector subsidies (USD 128 billion), biofuels for about 6 % (USD 38 billion) and nuclear for at least 3 % (USD 21 billion)...

Subsidies to petroleum products dominated the total, at USD 220 billion, followed by electricity-based support to fossil fuels at USD 128 billion. Subsidies to natural gas and coal in 2017 were estimated to be USD 82 billion and USD 17 billion, respectively.

https://www.irena.org/-/media/Files/IRENA/Agency/Publication/2020/Apr/IRENA_Energy_subsidies_2020.pdf

So basically, US subsidies are about 20 percent of the total global outlay of government subsidies for oil and gas.

Then there agriculture subsidies. In 2021, the federal government provided farms with $28.5 billion in subsidies, or direct farm program payments. That, combined with exploitation of migrant labor, keeps our food cheap.

So its socialism all the way down until you get to the consumer, then it is profit all the way up.

Malcolm wrote:

Appearances can not be found, on analysis. So we term them “clearly apparent nonexistents.”

Generally, we are working with the delusion about essences, whether appearances exist according to any of the four extremes.

In order to work with the delusion about essences, first we must remove delusion about appearances.

I gather from you though that the Ati literature says that sutra schools are wrong and the first moment of perceiving the red of a stop light is a conceptual consciousness.

The perception of redness of a stop light is not conceptual, nevertheless, it has an object, otherwise there could be no direct perception at all.

"Appearances cannot be found, on analysis. So we term them “clearly apparent nonexistents.” "

I love this term. I just learned it a week ago and it seems to help my practice. It sounds so rang tong with the non-finding under analysis language. Do you consider rang tong to be correct? Or, are rang tong and shen tong extremes to be discarded?

I have written extensively on this site about my opinion ove the so-called rang stong/gzhan stong debate. It's a nondebate. "Rang stong" is a gshan stong straw man. There is no such thing as "rang stong."

Is my dull mind an appearance?

Any mental image is an "appearance," whether it is a physical or a mental appearance. We do make a distinction in Dzogchen between appearances and apparent objects. You can take my Wisdom Academy course, I will discuss this in some detail.

The Valid Cognition literature coming from Dignaga defines 7 types of valid direct perception: the 5 sense direct perceptions involving sense organs, mental direct perception and yogic direct perception (related to powers stemming from clairvoyance, etc.).

Appearances can not be found, on analysis. So we term them “clearly apparent nonexistents.”

Delusion has two levels: delusion about appearances and essences.

Generally, we are working with the delusion about essences, whether appearances exist according to any of the four extremes.

Well in that case, Dzongkapa and his followers have unwarranted assumptions....

Malcolm wrote:
Some people do argue this.

My entire argument hinges on Dzongkapa's view of the impossibility of validly ascertaining the object of negation prior to having a direct perception (mngon sum) of emptiness. He doesn't write about this much but he states it in the introduction to his commentary on the Sutra Unraveling the Thought (mdo sde dgongs 'grel). [/quote]

One cannot really have a direct perception of emptiness, since a direct perception requires a sense organ and a sense objects, as well as a sense consciousness which functions through that organ. This is why Śantideva states in chapter 9 of the Bodhicaryāvatāra:

The ultimate is not within the domain the mind,
the mind is relative.

And:

When neither an existent nor a nonexistent
remain before the mind,
there being no other alternative, 
the mind is pacified.

Thus, the term "direct perception of emptiness" is just a convention for a nonperception.


OB1 said:
Interestingly, in my clinical work with young people with a psychotic range of mental functioning, I found it important to help them conceptually differentiate the negation of inherent existence from the negation of appearances. It was a convenient conceptual schema for avoiding the extreme of nihilism.

Malcolm wrote:
People with secure attachment are far more likely to be able to understand emptiness as a remedy to their afflictive states than those who cannot even begin to perceive they are in an intensified state of affliction (psychotic break) to begin with.

In any case, no one meditates on emptiness directly. As you allude to, one meditates on appearances, and tries to discern their nature through analytical reasoning. That's not what we do in Vajrayāna, as well as Dzogchen, but that is what people do in sūtra.

In one of the few cases where I have been asked to intervene with someone who was on the verge of a such a break, the best option for them, rather than Buddhist philosophy, was to remind them that they had a loving wife, whom they needed to trust, and that if she insisted that something was the case that contradicted the delusion they were experiencing, they should trust her and not the delusion (this person was stuck in the Descarte's demon trap). I am not convinced Buddhist philosophy is the best solution for a person who is spinning out. But what do I know, I am not a shrink.

My contention is that people with so-called Secure Attachments are somewhat ill equipped to feel the impact of analytic meditation on emptiness.

Malcolm wrote:
That’s an unproven assertion. I would argue the opposite.

OB1 said:
Alright, let's do this! I'll make the argument and you show me where I'm wrong. Fortunately, I think the shrooms have worn off

I understand that this is a Dzogchen forum but please keep in mind that I'm defending the above quoted claim specifically contextualized within the school of Madhyamika. My argument is not being presented autonomously but as a defense to a qualm raised by a senior practitioner on the forum.

My thesis: Individuals with a Secure attachment style are somewhat ill equipped for doing Madhyamika analysis.

Premise 1: In order for meditative analysis on the emptiness of the self of persons to work it is necessary to ascertain the object of negation (dgag chya).

P2: Individuals who have not previously had a direct perception of emptiness do not ascertain the object of negation thru valud cognition (tshad ma). In other words, the misconception of the self of persons is not validly ascertained thru an incontrovertible consciousness (mi slu ba'i rig pa).

This premise is established by the following: 1) The inherently established self (rang bzhin gyis grub pa) does not exist. 2) You cannot perceive something that does not exist. Only beings (on first level bhumi and above) who already have a direct perception of emptiness can directly perceive the misconception of inherent existence. 3) It is necessary to have a direct perception of the misconception of inherent existence in order to validly (tshad ma) identify the object of negation. 4) beings that have not had a direct perception of emptiness must rely on an invalid cognition to ascertain the object of negation. They must rely on a correctly assuming consciousness (yid dpyod). A correctly assuming consciousness is not incontrovertible (mi slu ba'i rig pa). Since beings, not on the bhumis, must rely on a controvertible invalid cognition to identify what is negated through the view of emptiness there is a lot of room for error and uncertainty. No wonder why it takes two incalculable eons just to arrive at the first bhumi!

P3: Ordinary beings with a Secure Attachment style acquire their secure sense of a self in dependence upon consistent reliable caregiving beginning from a young age. These beings easily achieve developmental stages such as Object Permanency. There is no need to hallucinate an imaginary reliable caregiver nor is there a need to imagine themselves as having omnipotent or omniscient powers. On the other hand, beings with disorganized attachment styles rely on such ideations in order cope with the stresses related to a lack of present and supportive care-giving. The developmental stage of Object Permanency may not ever be attained because they live in an imaginary world. They don't experience a stable sense of a self because their sense of self is projected as imaginary friends and so forth. Only when alone in bed practicing self-taught calm abiding can their imaginary friends be stabilized.

P4 Back to meditative analysis and the first of five stages of meditative analysis as is outlined by the 5th Dalai Lama in his commentary on the Root versus of Manjushri translated in Meditation on Emptiness (Hopkins trans.). Ascertaining the Object of Negation is tricky. The moment that the concretely appearing, "I" shows itself to the meditator it disappears almost immediately upon observation! The Dalai lama recommends observing the concretely appearing "I" as if from the corner of your eye. Another method is to recall occasions of having been wrongfully accused. The "I" appears more vividly when wrongfully accused. However, one has to become convinced that everything is on the line. If this appearing "I" is proven unfindable, one must be utterly convinced of its lack of true existence. The conclusion is like being struck by lightning.

P5: Now our guys with Secure and Disorganized Attachment styles are trying to ascertain the object of negation. Granted they both have to use guess work because it can't really be done through valid cognition. We are talking about allowing a hallucination to arise and be believed in. The Disorganized guy is the natural expert because he has been hallucinating all his life and most importantly, actively invested in believing in his hallucinations. The world tells him that rabbit horns don't exist but to him they do and he suffers terribly for it. When he refutes his belief in appearances, this saves him from the pits of hell.
The Securely attached guy is like, "Ya, whatever. The appearing "I" for a moment looked like myself as a baby when Johnny stole my candy". Then he goes on to study Nagarjuna's arguments and concludes that they are tautological.
Besides, he doesn't really want anything to do with a meditation on the emptiness of the self of persons because his secure sense of the self is ego-syntonic. He just needs a better job, house, wife and cat. Unfortunately, death comes along and he's totally unprepared. The schizophrenic never felt like he was born. Having the walls melt down and the ground fall out from under is just another day at the office and so is death.

Ok, I'm taking this a little too far but I appreciate the opportunity to clarify my thinking (based on my experience) of this matter.

There are so many unwarranted assumptions in your response I hardly know where to begin, apart from to say ascertaining the object of negation isn’t hard at all, since the object of negation of Madhyamaka is existence, etc., not solely inherent existence.

Lingpupa said:
Yes, back to the first post, and the reason for all this back and forth is right there. "Accessibility" and "mental health" are very broad, abstract terms, and there is little point talking about them without tying them down. Nyamlae, could you describe at least one case in which someone with "mental health issues" was denied access to teachings or practice facilities for that reason? What was the nature of the illness? How did it affect their behaviour? How was the access restricted?

I'm not asking you to prove your case - it could be fictional, if you like. But it would help my understanding if I knew what kind of thing you are talking about.

nyamlae said:
I can't really speak to people being denied access due to mental health issues. The issues I've seen are more often about a lack of accommodation, rather than active exclusion, and most of the issues I've seen involve trauma responses.

For example, I know someone with PTSD who gets scared in crowds. People notice that he doesn't travel or get out much. His lack of engagement is often assumed to be a lack of interest or seriousness on his part, and people rarely make an effort to understand him better. Having the option to do events online helps him access teachings that he wouldn't otherwise be able to sit through in person, but the communities he's most interested in rarely do online events. This set of conditions are an obstacle to him engaging in the dharma and the sangha.

Malcolm wrote:
Quite sad, but perhaps they need treatment for their PTSD.

nyamlae said:
Some people have childhood trauma and get triggered by teachers or sangha members speaking harshly  in an accusatory way. Healthy people might get uncomfortable when spoken to in this way, but for people with childhood trauma it can completely make them shut down. Their mind will go completely blank, they will be unable to remember things during the event, they might start crying involuntarily, and they feel intense shame and embarrassment about this response. If they're separately given practices that actually improve their condition, then great, but in the meantime it damages their connection to the community and their ability to learn the dharma.

Malcolm wrote:
The only way this works is if such people identify themselves beforehand, that in itself is a huge risk. And, what kind of “separately given” practices do you have in mind?

nyamlae said:
On top of these initial obstacles, people with these issues often are shamed or blamed for their responses. This whole set of conditions can make dharma practice an extremely negative experience. The most important cultural shift (in my opinion) would be for people to approach accessibility with curiosity and respect. I believe in actively soliciting people's feedback about accessibility, collaboratively finding ways for people to practice in spite of their obstacles, and holding people in positive regard even if ( especially if) they're not operating as well as other practitioners are.

I would venture a guess that many or even most of the people you describe would be hard pressed to out themselves to event organizers or teachers.

You read about psychology from good sources, then look at these tendencies in your mind, then understand that others who have these just have them in technicolor. Then you learn what the best methods are to respond to people with varying tendencies. For example, narcissists tend to need to be validated until they can tolerate the experience of not being one-mind. Or borderlines need to be treated with great love and given good boundaries, etc. It takes time to understand, and maybe people don't think it's relevant to dharma, but this is ridiculous. If you said dharma folks don't need to learn about electrical engineering to practice, I would agree. But psychology is just the study of the mind, which is very close to dharma in the sense that we're describing issues that happen as soon as one "deviates" from rigpa.

I am simply calling for more dharma teachers and practitioners to actively take on this focus. I'm tired of people debating whether it's feasible -- I know it's feasible, it's a very common skillset in my generation.

Teaching dharma and being a mental health counselor are very different sorts of tasks, requiring different training and skill sets.

Although this is a very popular view among practitioners these days, it's a false one. I've met plenty of people with severe mental health diagnoses who have done very well in the dharma without *first* becoming the sort of person others want to hang out with because they are 'tolerably balanced'. How stable do you think Milarepa's mental health was when he murdered all of those folks? Do you think he worked with a clinical psychologist prior to meeting Marpa and spending his life in practice and realizing buddhahood? Of course it's not a bad thing to practice dharma simultaneously with being in therapy (since developing intelligence about the thought/emotional patterns which go along with mental health issues is extremely helpful) but getting years of therapy prior to beginning the path is not necessary.

stoneinfocus said:
It's not necessary, but it's pretty obvious that someone whose life is in shambles is going to have a pretty hard time focusing on Dharma. It was much harder to practice as a clinically depressed person with no income; pretty much all my energy was spent on that, whether I wanted it to be or not. Some people are lucky if they can get out of bed to shower, let alone even think about Dharma.

Kai lord said:
Mi-pham attempts to interpret Rong-zom-pa's statements in which he unquestionably maintains that gnosis does not exist at the stage of a buddha as only referring to gnosis that had been generated on the path but not to gnosis as such, for Rong-zom-pa, Mi-pham argues, is an expounder of rDzogs-chen, a system in which what is called 'self-occurring gnosis' (rang byung gi ye shes: svayaṃbhūjñāna) features prominently. Nonetheless, from my examination of Rong-zom-pa's discussions of the whole issue, it has become evident that he did indeed deny the existence of any cognitive element whatsoever at the stage of a buddha, the sole constituent of Buddhahood being for him the purified dharmadhātu. Although he alludes to self-occurring gnosis on numerous occasions in his works, there is a salient difference between his and Mi-pham's understanding of the term: for Mi-pham self-occurring gnosis is something cognitive, whereas for Rong-zom-pa, who equates it with the dharmadhātu, it is not. Rong-zom-pa, however, does not deny that a buddha's gnosis, as mere appearance, manifests to those who have not yet attained release and thus have not yet eliminated all their delusions. A buddha, on the other hand, whose delusions have been completely exhausted, does not possess such gnosis.
Interesting to read that Mipham's position on Jnana Dharmakaya is closer to Gelug than expected.

Malcolm wrote:
I would not be so hasty. Mipham's commentary on the Cultivation of Bodhicitta, when discussing the nonexistence of buddhahood, states:

[Root] Since the awakening of the sugata does not exist, his magical apparitions appear to the deluded, similar to an illusion. 

[Commentary] Since the awakening of the sugata does not exist, his magical apparition, while a false appearance, appears to the deluded, similar to an illusion.

[Root] Likewise, the pure pristine consciousnesses that are a stream of utter virtue 
and the arising of their perceptions of the dharmadhātu itself are to be investigated.
Because the vajra has no basis and mutual existence [is not established], the nature is similar;
and as there is no partiality for those [pure pristine consciousnesses] — the dharmadhātu, the vajra, and the pinnacle— there are no moments.


[Commentary] Likewise, when those nonconceptual, pure gnoses that are a stream of limitless roots of utter virtue and the unmistaken dharmadhātu that gives rise to the perceptions of those gnoses are analytically investigated, they are not established. In this way, because the basis or cause of that vajra, nonconceptual gnosis, does not exist in the mind, there is also no resultant gnosis. Therefore, since their mutual existence is not established, they become similar in every respect to the nature of the mind that is not established and are the same. The assertion of the Vijñāptivadins that gnosis is ultimate is also not established. The vajra-like gnosis that realizes the dharmadhātu is the pinnacle of all gnosis. Since they do not perceive any partiality at all, those gnoses are not momentary."

And:

[Root] The root of pure virtue [is similar to] a reflection. Since [the root of pure virtue] does not exist, mundane gnosis also does not exist.

[Commentary] The root of the pure virtue of the three wheels is similar to a reflection. Since [the root of pure virtue] does not truly exist, the pure, mundane gnosis which depends on that also does not exist.

Also Rongzom's view of this depends on Mañjuśrīmitra, as does Longchenpa's view, as well as being one more point which shows that gzhan stong is not compatible with Dzogchen teachings.

For that, you need to do an economic analysis, and in that field Polanyi's is quite lacking.

Looking at the book myself, I can't help but feel you have grossly mischaracterized Milanovic's argument. Political capitalism is a term he gets from Max Weber, who described a "politically motivated capitalism" (incidentally, Max Weber and Ludwig von Mises were contemporaries and friends; Mises would have been quite aware of this idea). Milanovic raises this idea after he questions why it is that liberals were unable to predict the world wars, and the following trends in socioeconomic development.

Malcolm wrote:
Political capitalism is a term he uses to describe the capitalism which grew out of communism in underdeveloped nations.

natusake said:
Having looked at these sections of the book, I am not convinced by any means that Milanovic is directing his statements to libertarians as you describe.

All markets have always been regulated. The central role of government, as mentioned above, is the regulation and protection of markets. Markets are idiots, they are not intelligent, and this is demonstrably shown time and again:

Liberal writers like Spencer and Sumner, Mises and Lippmann offer an account of the double movement substantially similar to our own, but they put an entirely different interpretation on it. While in our view the concept of a self-regulating market was utopian, and its progress was stopped by the realistic self-protection of society, in their view all protectionism was a mistake due to impatience, greed, and shortsightedness, but for which the market would have resolved its difficulties. The question as to which of these two views is correct is perhaps the most important problem of recent social history, involving as it does no less than a decision on the claim of economic liberalism to be the basic organizing principle in society. Before we turn to the testimony of the facts, a more precise formulation of the issue is needed.

Polanyi, Karl. The Great Transformation (p. 148). Beacon Press. Kindle Edition.

And:

Finally, the behavior of liberals themselves proved that the maintenance of freedom of trade—in our terms, of a self-regulating market—far from excluding intervention, in effect, demanded such action, and that liberals themselves regularly called for compulsory action on the part of the state as in the case of trade union law and anti-trust laws. Thus nothing could be more decisive than the evidence of history as to which of the two contending interpretations of the double movement was correct: that of the economic liberal who maintained that his policy never had a chance, but was strangled by shortsighted trade unionists, Marxist intellectuals, greedy manufacturers, and reactionary landlords; or that of his critics, who can point to the universal “collectivist” reaction against the expansion of market economy in the second half of the nineteenth century as conclusive proof of the peril to society inherent in the utopian principle of a self-regulating market.

The objective of political capitalism is to take politics out of people’s minds, which can be more easily done when disenchantment and lack of interest in democratic politics are high.

Mises, Hayek, Rawls, etc., were unequipped to imagine political capitalism; they imagined, wrongly, that capitalism and democracy were coterminous. Demonstrably, they are not.

natusake said:
Even if Milanovich is correct, I can hardly see this as a worse situation than the inevitable road to socialism that Mises amply proves interventionism to lead us….

But I cannot imagine that Milanovich could possibly be describing what he sees as politics in the present day. Modern politics undoubtedly is a result of the unopposed support for government intervention in the economy, not due to laissez-faire.

Malcolm wrote:
There is no longer a road to “socialism” anywhere. And yes, he is describing modern political economy. You need to get with it and cease relying  on the outdated views of political economists of the past. Milanovich goes over their errors and their inability to predict the rise of political capitalism. Like most libertarians, you’ve betrayed your hand by admitting that “rule by elites” isn’t that bad. That’s the “proto-communist policies” Milanovich points out is a result of the libertarian small state. Nozick too is smart, but not that smart.

You better read Milanovic’s two books, the first on globalism, the second, Capitalism, Alone. He concludes the latter book with this final paragraph:

If liberal capitalism were to evolve toward political capitalism, it would display all or most of the features that I discussed in Chapter 3. A very effective management of the economy would be required to produce the relatively high growth rates that would keep the population satisfied; an efficient bureaucracy would be needed to implement such measures; and there would be an increase in intrinsic corruption that can always, in the long term, present a threat to the survival of a regime.

The approach to competition today and the one Hayek speaks about here do not differ in essentials. If you're not going to read the article I referenced, then why did you even ask? Hayek's argument applies even more strikingly to mathematical economics today. In actual fact, you cannot do most of what is important in economics with mathematics.

Of course I’ve read Hayek, but these days he’s more likely to be taught in a history of philosophy course than in an economics course.

And how many centuries after Cāndrakīrti was Atisha? I don't know why you won't just concede the fact that Cāndrakīrti was not taken seriously in India for centuries after his death and that the prominence the rangtongpas ascribe to him is largely a byproduct of Tibetan polemics and politics.

Malcolm wrote:
Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

Secondly, we know that Candra created some discomfort in the Madhyamaka community, since 8th century authors like Jñānagarbha, as well as the translators of the Santipa's 11th century Madhyamakālaṃkara, complain about him, committed as they were to syllogistic arguments about emptiness, arguments that Candra shows are not the intention of Nāgārjuna, since the latter exclusively uses consequences nd not formal syllogisms. And then there is the famous debate between Candrakīrti and Candragomin.

In reality, Candra is just defending Buddhapalita against Bhavaviveka's criticism that the latter merely used a simple consequence, rather than formal negation, to refute the Samkhya assertion that effects exist in causes. Since Candra is merely defending Buddhapalita, this may account for a lack of commentarial interest, as Candra is just doing mop-up work, and establishing the final Madhyamaka view by resorting to many citations, which Buddhapalita uses sparingly. And it is not the case he was unknown in the 8th century, for example his Yuktiṣaṣṭikāvṛtti was translated by Jinamitra, Dānaśīla, Śīlendrabodhi, and Ye-shes-sde

The Buddha's experience of gnosis is greatly detailed in the PP sūtras, there is no reason for Candra to extensively comment on it. However he says things like:

"Since [a buddha's] mind is unimpeded with respect to everything, it is called "all knowing (sarvajñāna)."

I mean, what else could one possibly need to know about the experience of a buddha?

Candra's main interest is eliminating wrong views among Buddhists——that's the point of Madhyamaka anyway.

In any case, he discusses gnosis in his  Yuktiṣaṣṭikāvṛtti a bit more than in his other texts, apart from the MAV commentary (where there are 18 references to all-knowledge, 107 references to gnosis (jnāna) of various kinds, and so on). An essential component of nondual gnosis for Candra is compassion, etc.

Umm, no, what you are saying is bullshit.

Taxation is not "robbing" people. In fact, during the period of the strongest economic growth in the US, the marginal tax rate for the wealthiest was, in 2020 dollars, 91% over 2 million in income. If you can't live on 2 million dollars a year, you are a total loser. This rate encouraged business growth.

When you account for all taxes, as professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Sucman did in their book, “The Triumph of Injustice,” the overall tax system in America is nearly flat, and the 400 taxpayers at the very top — billionaires, that is — pay the lowest overall rate. It was factual, not “demagoguery,” as some have charged, for President Biden to say that billionaires pay lower tax rates than their secretaries. 

No, America doesn’t drain the affluent. But the highly affluent — particularly, the top 1 percent — sure are draining the rest of us.

Referring back to some of the truths written in DNS and Natusake’s posts on the first page of this thread, you’d think that there would be more variation among western Buddhists in their political and social views, instead of seemingly 70%+ leaning so far left

Malcolm wrote:
If you examine the Ratnavali, for example, you will discover that Nāgārjuna recommended universal health care, eliminating capital punishment, etc. The Buddha himself advocated for socially liberal policies——indeed, Buddha probably invented CRT when he castigated the varna system as a form of structural racism in Indian society, admitted women to the ordained Sangha and so on. In response, Buddhism met with strongest resistance from the Conservative element of Indian society, brahmins, who followd the Laws of Manu, etc. Thus, it is really no surprise whatsoever that Buddhism is popular amongst Liberals. Buddhism is not popular with the Left however, who generally follow some sort of materialist leanings, a hang over from Marx.

Thus, Buddhism is an inherently liberal doctrine, unlike Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Confuscism, Taoism, and so on. As Aryadeva points out, kings are fools.

It seems that Rep. James Comer wont let this just fade away.
The House Oversight and Reform Committee expects to uncover $20M-$30M in bribes received by the Biden family from foreign nationals during his time as VP.

The revelation was made by Rep. James Comer who suggested that the web of alleged bribes ran deeper than originally thought.

"There's more money that we are going to be able to identify that was transferred between foreign nationals and the Biden family."

"We have more bank records coming but we are going to exceed $10 million this week and I think we will get up between $20 and $30 million."
From Forbes (Oct 22, 2020)
....When Biden left the West Wing, the big money started coming. In 2017, the Bidens declared $11.1 million in total earnings, nearly twice as much in a single year as they had made in the previous 18 years combined. About $10 million of that flowed through two S-corporations called CelticCapri and Giacoppa.

It's understandable, since the whole Burisma thing is a puton, found to be baseless by DOJ during the former adminstration:

Representative James R. Comer, the Kentucky Republican who is chairman of the Oversight Committee, made the announcement after summoning F.B.I. officials to Capitol Hill for a closed-door briefing on a document containing an unverified allegation of bribery against Mr. Biden when he was vice president. The Trump Justice Department investigated the allegation, which involved his son Hunter Biden’s dealings in Ukraine, in 2020, but prosecutors could not substantiate the claims, according to two people familiar with the matter...“What we’re talking about is secondhand hearsay,” Mr. Raskin said, adding, “That confidential human source said that he had no way of knowing about the underlying veracity of the things that he was being told...Representative Dan Goldman, Democrat of New York and a member of the Oversight Committee who examined allegations against Mr. Biden and Burisma as part of a House impeachment team in 2019, said the Republican narrative had fallen flat because Mr. Biden sought to crack down on corruption in Ukraine, not enable it.

“The facts are actually directly contrary to any of the Republican allegations,” Mr. Goldman said.”

If one understands the meaning and symbolism of that syllable, yes, that's all one needs. The job of a teacher is to explain that meaning and symbolism to the student.

Mind (sems) and pristine consciousness (ye shes),
are neither the same nor different.
They are phenomena that are difficult to differentiate.
The mind is the potential (rtsal) of pristine consciousness.
The basis of the mind is pristine consciousness.
Therefore, since mind and pristine consciousness

there is so-called liberation and nonliberation

Malcolm wrote:
That's not actually true, theoretically or actually:

Here, however, the transformation from feudalism to capitalism took place under the control of an extremely powerful state, a different process from what happened in Europe and North America, where the role of the state was much less important and where countries were free of foreign interference.20 But this is a fundamental difference; and this difference in the role of the state explains why capitalism in China, Vietnam, and many other places, either in the past (South Korea) or currently (Ethiopia, Rwanda), has so often had an authoritarian edge to it.

The argument that communism was the system that enabled the transition from feudalism to indigenous capitalism in countries that were colonized or dominated by the West is also supported by the fact that communism was more successful in less-developed countries. When we measure the success of communism either by a crude growth rate or, preferably, by comparing the performance of communist countries against capitalist countries at the same level of development, we find a negative correlation between the income level of a country at the time when it became communist and its subsequent absolute growth rate, or its growth rate relative to its capitalist counterparts. In simple terms, this means that communism was least successful in developed industrial economies like East Germany and Czechoslovakia and most successful in poor agricultural societies like China and Vietnam.

What about that means a person will tirelessly devote their time to helping others?

PadmaVonSamba said:
Are you basically asking on what principle
does awakening (direct realization of emptiness)
launch compassion?

Does it create an “urge” to free others from samsara, and if so, why?

Is this the question?

stong gzugs said:
Yes, but specifically from the viewpoint of Cāndrakīrti. We have to remember that Cāndrakīrti's basically unable to provide any specificity about the actual (non)experience(?) of Buddhas. But he does say what it isn't, and that much enough is problematic. Because for Cāndrakīrti jñana is merely the non-arising of the mind paralleling the non-arising of any phenomena, then Buddhas not only don't even perceive the conventional reality like tables and chairs (because even perceptions are conceptually structured in his theory, unlike in Dharmakīrti's), but Buddhas also don't know ultimate reality either (because there's no mind to know and nothing to be known, as jñana is defined as an absence of mind, not asserted as something positive with its own qualities).

Where, in all this, do you get the ability and motivation to teach others? Consider ability: if Buddhas don't even see the conventional world, how do they interact with sentient beings to benefit them, as they don't even really see sentient beings which are part of conventional reality; and how could they use language, as they are without concepts that undergird all language? Because Buddhas don't know any thing, they can't really teach or benefit others. And even if you could somehow account for the ability, where does this motivation come from?

Surely Cāndrakīrti must have a good answer to these major problems in his system? No, not really. Cāndrakīrti's explanation of how Buddhas teach and benefit others is as vague and far-fetched as his explanations of what the Buddhas' experience of jñana is. In terms of ability, he roughly claims that form bodies are produced through accumulations of merit and the teachings emerge (in some mysterious unexplained way) as sounds from this non-arising of mind that knows nothing and has no content, and that these sounds aren't just coming from mouths but also from other random objects? What about motivation? The Buddhas don't have any mind any more, but back when they did, they were like potters spinning a wheel and had intentions to act to benefit others, and the wheel continues to spin even now that they have lost their minds that can create intentions to act. (So if the accumulations of merit and vows and intentions that produce the form bodies are dependently originated through action, won't the wheel eventually slow down and stop spinning, so Buddhas are also impermanent?). And if you really push him on this? Well, again another vague metaphor, he says there is no real ability or motivation to help others presently for Buddhas, but the Buddhas are instead like wish fulfilling gems that grant wishes and help mechanically, without using any mind or feeling of compassion whatsoever.

So, anybody is absolutely free to build their view around Cāndrakīrti and place their enlightenment in his hands. But I'm not really going to put my trust in someone who can't coherently explain the experience of Buddhas and how/why Buddhas benefit others, especially when he basically seems to be describing something akin to a zombie. These issues are well-known and there simply aren't good answers, even though people have offered their own convoluted fixes to these ideas. As I have said before, Cāndrakīrti wasn't a serious commentator in India, and had maybe only one Indian seriously engage with his ideas, Jayānanda, who points out these issues. Cāndrakīrti only became popularized in the Tibetan polemical context, especially promoted by Tsongkhapa, who had a very novel re-interpretation of Cāndrakīrti anyways, in part because of these issues. I get the sense that this conversation has wound itself down, and I've also lost steam on this to reply much further, but I find it funny that rangtongpas standing in this house of glass try to throw stones at gzhanstong. But this will have to be a conversation for another day!

From a historical prospective, Vilāsavajra wrote in his work, Spar Khabs commentary to the Guhyagarbha Tantra, did mention Atiyoga (one of the earliest written references on Dzogchen) being separate from Mahayoga but he never make the former into the independent vehicle and insisted that the former is still dependent on the latter and emerges from it. Guru Rinpoche wrote Garland of views about seven Vehicles in which Atiyoga is seen as a separate (and probably independent from the rest) technique of the seventh vehicle.

Its not until Nupchen Sangye Yeshe in his famous anuyoga commentary, Armor Against Darkness,  that the arguments for Atiyoga as an independent vehicle totally divorce from Mahayoga and the  nine vehicle doxography really appeared as a formal debate.

Hence the movement to make Dzogchen an independent vehicle started even before the 17 tantras were formally written down. And as you can see, that debate continues till today.

DW is somewhat unique in that it keeps returning to the argument about Dzogchen being or not being an entirely standalone path, intrinsically separate from tantra; two different worlds that may or may not be merged, at user's discretion. I have never heard it phrased exactly like that by any teacher, to be honest. Even the ones who often teach Dzogchen qua Dzogchen (including Bon lamas) will not use these words. When ChNN taught Longsal sadhanas, he did so because he thought they can both help one discover the state and help one develop one's Dzogchen practice, as he often said -- so no real separation here.

Does that mean one can practice Dzogchen and never ever touch tantra? Well, ChNN also taught us to do puja regularly, and he never forgot to transmit the so-called secondary practices (which of course become primary if one can combine them with moments of resting in the state). There are teachers, such as James Low or some Bon lamas, who very rarely teach tantra (James changed this recently, btw). They do practice tantra themselves, though. I think the row about Dzogchen being or not being a completely standalone path is mostly semantics, tbh. But can one skip tantra entirely, and do just Dzogchen? But why are we asking -- is it just mere curiosity, or is there a practical, practice-related reason (another good question would be, why one would want or need to do that?) In the end one just follows the advice of one's teacher(s), after all...

Malcolm wrote:
ChNN made it quite clear that Dzogchen was a stand alone path, not an add on to Vajrayana. He never taught pujas as absolute requirements or samayas. He did, as you say, teach many Dzogchen adjacent cycles, as supports, in keeping with Manjushrimitra’s observation that there is also an indirect path of dzogchen through symbols. But he always maintained Dzogchen is an independent vehicle, entirely self-sufficient and complete, like the other nine yanas.

there has been nothing but an assertion that my estimate (i.e. that sadhana-free dzogchen doesn't get a lot of credence outside certain corners of the internet) is a mis-estimate, and a claim that they somehow must be there somewhere.

What's now more than clear, even if some are found at this stage, that such practioners are rare as garudas' teeth. My curiosity is satisfied.

Never mind. Re-read it, bearing in mind that it will be a different book next time, or not.

That's a huge jump from what I actually said.
And you present it as a flat statement, not even a question.

No, I don't support terrorism. I don't participate in it, I don't fund it, and I don't advocate for it.

That said, there are times when bad things produce good results (most karma is mixed, after all) and I do believe in accepting the good and making the best possible use of it. Letting it go to waste makes the whole thing negative, doesn't it?

In MOTF, as in real life, the world needs both the carrot and the stick to make the necessary changes. In the book, terrorism was a big stick (there were others). The Ministry provided carrots - planted carrots, if you like.

Hello,
I've just joined this site to ask a specific question that's been bothering me.
I'm a middle-aged married man, father to a young son, and lead a pretty contented life, very much a family man. I consider myself a Buddhist and think it has helped me greatly in terms of day-to-day life - I'm never envious of what others have, for example, and have become far less judgmental than I used to be. To me, Buddhism makes a lot of practical sense and certainly makes life better. I do try to be good to people, without being sanctimonious.
Well in case you haven't guessed where this is leading, I meet up with another woman every couple of weeks. She is also married. It is very enjoyable and consensual on both sides and something both of us need for its own sake, with no strings attached. At the time I never feel guilty about it in the least, even though I know it would hurt my wife a great deal if she knew. Since nobody is ever likely to find out, though, I tell myself it's a harmless, occasional pleasure that simply fills a physical need in life.
I've never tried to write this down before, and now that I have I must say it looks pretty awful.
I'm not trying to convince myself I'm right, but maybe some of you could convince me why it's wrong? I don't drink or smoke or gamble, and I do try hard to help others, so is giving in to this one human weakness such a bad thing? And how would I go about giving it up? That's the really tough part.
I look forward to any replies, thank you.

Most definitely sexual misconduct. You owe it to your wife to tell her the truth.

The major driver of change in the book is UN action in response to a particularly horrific heatwave.

1) Are buddha qualities the same as or different than omniscience? If they are the same, then the elimination of affliction through realizing emptiness free of extremes and attainment of omniscience are the same thing, just as raising a lamp in the dark room dispels darkness that’s been there for 1000 years. 1) if they are different than omniscience, than what are they? Where do they exist in the five aggregates that define a sentient being?

Not really, when you look at the definition - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autarky - and compare it to MOTF.
The Ministry of the title is in fact a UN body, and the whole project could not work without it.
The book's model is more of a mixed system, with big government driving a partial shift from market economies and bureaucratic dictatorships (a better term for most "communist" governments) towards regionalism and local control with socialist elements.

Malcolm wrote:
It precisely is this, “generally in an effort to build alternative economic structures or to control resources against structures a particular movement views as hostile.”

Kim O'Hara said:
Yes, that motivation applies to MOTF's plan. But autarky more broadly* is an attempt to establish self-sufficiency, independence, and the Ministry's reach is global so there is nothing left over to be independent from.

I'm still saying it's a mixed economic model.
