Frequently I hear in prayers about gaining the omniscience of the Buddha and this has led me to question this particular aspect. One of the reasons I left monotheistic religions is that I do not believe in a god that is omniscience, omnipresent, omnipotent, etc.

My question is: am I confusing my past experience of what omniscience means in Buddhism? Am I putting a western slant to an eastern idea which may view this heavily laden term differently? Any advice is needed. Thanks.

Malcolm wrote:
A buddha is omniscient about the _nature_ of all dharma and the extent of dharmas within their field of perception (and dharmas here is a very specific technical term), but more specifically it refers to their knowledge of all paths of liberation; not their insights into string theory.

What is karma? Please define your terms.

I'll go first. "Karma is volition, and what proceeds from volition."

Volitions spawn verbal and physical acts.

There are three kinds of karma: when meritorious, the result of karma is happiness and birth in higher realms when the conditions for their ripening assemble; when nonvirtuous, result is suffering and birth in lower realms when the conditions for their ripening assemble; and when neither meritorious nor nonvirtuous, result is neutral sensations and do not affect rebirth.

What you are are referring to is karmaphala, the result of karma and karmavipāka, the ripening of karma.

The result of karma will ripen solely on oneself, and it cannot be interfered with or prevented by anyone else other than oneself. Not even a buddha can remove some else's karma.

I never implied that one could not be influenced in positive or negative ways, nor that one could not influence others in positive and negative ways. But influencing others in positive and negative ways is still only's one own karma. And people's response to your influence is their own karma.

https://www.sapiens.org/column/race/cau ... gy-origin/

Unknown said:
The term “Caucasian” originated from a growing 18th-century European science of racial classification. German anatomist Johann Blumenbach visited the Caucasus Mountains, located between the Caspian and Black seas, and he must have been enchanted because he labeled the people there “Caucasians” and proposed that they were created in God’s image as an ideal form of humanity

And the label has stuck to this day. According to Mukhopadhyay, Blumenbach went on to name four other “races,” each considered “physically and morally ‘degenerate’ forms of ‘God’s original creation.’” He categorized Africans, excluding light-skinned North Africans, as “Ethiopians” or “black.” He divided non-Caucasian Asians into two separate races: the “Mongolian” or “yellow” race of Japan and China, and the “Malayan” or “brown” race, which included Aboriginal Australians and Pacific Islanders. And he called Native Americans the “red” race.

Blumenbach’s system of racial classification was adopted in the United States to justify racial discrimination—particularly slavery. Popular race science and evolutionary theories generally posited that there were separate races, that differences in behavior were tied to skin color, and that there were scientific ways to measure race. One way racial differences were defined was through craniometrics, which measured skull size to determine the intelligence of each racial group. As you can imagine, this flawed application of the scientific method resulted in race scientists developing a flawed system of racial classification that ranked the five races from most primitive (black and brown races), to more advanced (the Asian races), to the most advanced (the white, or Caucasian, races). Even though the five-race topology was later disproven, “Caucasian” still has currency in the U.S.

One reason we keep using the term “Caucasian” is that the U.S. legal system made use of Blumenbach’s taxonomy. As early as 1790 the first naturalization law was passed, preventing foreigners who were not white from becoming citizens. But according to Mukhopadhyay, Blumenbach’s category of “Caucasian” posed a problem because his classification of white also included some North Africans, Armenians, Persians, Arabs, and North Indians. The definition of Caucasian had to be reinvented to focus the ideological category of whiteness on northern and western Europe. The term, even though its exact definition changed over time, was used to shape legal policy and the nature of our society.

No, this is not correct at all.

First the question of “deserved” is false. Karma  is unerring, and it’s result is commensurate with the intention that produced it.

Kimberle Crenshaw (she who coined the term "intersectionality"--which, like CRT itself, has come to mean something different than it initially did) springs to mind.  Much of her work focuses specifically on race and gender, but she certainly includes a class analysis in her work.  For example, from the 1989 paper in which she coined the term, here's her description of the problem:

Malcolm wrote:
And here is an article from 2017, where she fleshes out the falsity of post-racial America:

https://thebaffler.com/salvos/race-to-bottom-crenshaw

Genjo Conan said:
Within the Obama-era bid to characterize America’s newly transformed social order as “post-racial,” a striking bit of legerdemain took hold. The term worked both to de-historicize race in American society and, perversely enough, to reframe the idea of racism as something that was very much the opposite of the lived experience of race in America. Under this inside-out account of our racial history, a post-racial America was, by definition, a racially egalitarian America, no longer measured by forward-looking assessments of how far we have come, but by congratulatory declarations that we have arrived.

In one sense, there’s nothing conceptually new about this. For two decades, an entire industry of lawyers, politicians, pundits, and foundations rallied around the banner of colorblindness in an effort to convince judges, policymakers, and voters that the project of racial reform was completed long ago.[2] Colorblindness fueled a host of right-wing projects throughout the 1990s and the early twenty-first century, including Ward Connerly’s assault on both affirmative action and the collection of racial data,[3] along with efforts by others to attack the Voting Rights Act and Title VII. With the rhetoric of colorblindness thus conscripted as a justification of first resort for rolling back the gains of the civil rights revolution, moderates and liberals—together with the traditional civil rights establishment—regarded it with a good deal of justified suspicion. In his 2000 presidential run, for example, Al Gore likened the colorblind rhetoric of the nineties GOP to a “duck blind” offering cover to the forces of racial reaction.

A good summary of CRT:

https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what- ... ck/2021/05

This is what uninformed people state about CRT, and these are all the talking points bandied about by conservatives:

Unknown said:
"One conservative organization, the Heritage Foundation, recently attributed a whole host of issues to CRT, including the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, LGBTQ clubs in schools, diversity training in federal agencies and organizations, California’s recent ethnic studies model curriculum, the free-speech debate on college campuses, and alternatives to exclusionary discipline—such as the Promise program in Broward County, Fla., that some parents blame for the Parkland school shootings. “When followed to its logical conclusion, CRT is destructive and rejects the fundamental ideas on which our constitutional republic is based,” the organization claimed.

Malcolm wrote:
This is what they wish to deny:

Unknown said:
The theory says that racism is part of everyday life, so people—white or nonwhite—who don’t intend to be racist can nevertheless make choices that fuel racism.


Malcolm wrote:
This is what Archie is worried about.

Unknown said:
Some critics claim that the theory advocates discriminating against white people in order to achieve equity. They mainly aim those accusations at theorists who advocate for policies that explicitly take race into account. (The writer Ibram X. Kendi, whose recent popular book How to Be An Antiracist suggests that discrimination that creates equity can be considered anti-racist, is often cited in this context.)

Malcolm wrote:
All these people oppose Affirmative Action, one of the best policies for ending class disparities in our lifetime.


Unknown said:
Fundamentally, though, the disagreement springs from different conceptions of racism. CRT puts an emphasis on outcomes, not merely on individuals’ own beliefs, and it calls on these outcomes to be examined and rectified. Among lawyers, teachers, policymakers, and the general public, there are many disagreements about how precisely to do those things, and to what extent race should be explicitly appealed to or referred to in the process.

Malcolm wrote:
This is what people can't stand, that their very existence is owed to a racist set of social and economic conditions, even though they may not themselves possess racist beliefs. However, what I observe, is that the people who most offended by this idea often wind up becoming full blown racists. I have seen it happen.

I strongly suspect that the reason this is being debated in such a heated way is that there has been a concerted effort to create political tension over this, as it is a potentially inflammatory wedge issue.  "Vaccine passports" are just the newest addition to a long list of topics such as "death panels", "critical race theory", "black-on-black violence" or take your pick of other slogans.

And actually it's almost impossible to have a discussion about whether "mandating" "vaccine passports" is a good or a bad thing, because you have to actually define what you're talking about.  Proof of vaccination to enter certain premises? Participate in certain events?  How prevalent would this be?  What level of government enforces it?  Maintains records?  Who has access to the records?  Are there medical exemptions and how obtained?  Are we taking a position of default exclusion, or default inclusion?  Do private individuals and companies get to decide whether to include or exclude?  Etc etc.  We don't know, and that's the point.

That said I would hold a few basic truths to be self-evident here:

1. Different societies can reasonably come to different consensuses on what the role of the state is in public health.  Some countries will opt for monitoring of all individuals' movements and health conditions.  Other societies will decide that the state should have zero involvement.  There's nothing intrinsically good or bad about any of these positions.

2. There are, within the US, many very different societies that will have very different views on this, stratified by geography, wealth, race, etc.  It is almost inconceivable that there could be a nationwide consensus with broad support.

3. It is completely possible to implement these tracking systems in a privacy-protecting, non-intrusive way.

4. It is almost certain that no US governmental authority is sufficiently competent to achieve #3

5. It is absolutely certain that any US governmental entity will abuse its authority while doing #3 to give more power to law enforcement by the backdoor

6. It is completely consistent with historic practice that certain activities require proof of medical status, which may include vaccination, and I believe it lies well within the remit of emergency powers at both federal and state level.

7. It is completely rational, given what we know about the coronavirus, that a society should seek to implement a system that tracks who is unvaccinated and prohibits them from engaging in certain activities.

Finally - the post at the start of this thread by Nightbloom is insidious, hypocritical BS dressed up in pseudodharma.  I believe the technical term is concern trolling.  This is the sort of behavior that should get people kicked off the site.

His thesis, that some disparities we see may originate in the sociology of Black people, may be true, however, how can he claim that very sociology was not formed by the deeply racist,  post-reconstruction period in the US? Long and short of it, he can’t.

The arguments for systemic racism in America are far stronger than those against. But I know white people, Bill Maher, etc., take comfort in the soothing words of the few Black intellectuals who seek to disarm its more serious implications. Indeed, Friday, Bill was going off about wokeness again with George Will, and just repeated Fox News talking points. He was pretty unhappy his other guest, Christina Bellantoni pushed back hard against his assertions. He also, cluelessly, went off on the so-called Black national anthem, forgetting that the original poem on which our national anthem is based, explicitly supports slavery.

Malcolm wrote:
Buddhist Ethics, page 261; the 7th root downfall, disclosing secrets. This includes using a partner who has not taken empowerment (first branch downfall) to practice actual karmamudra with them (since it is an explicit secret mantra ritual procedure).

Buddhist Ethics, page 265; the first branch downfall, to rely on a consort who lacks samaya, has broken samaya, etc.

In West, it is a lonely world for the single, lay Vajrayāna practitioner.

At best, if one's partner is not a Vajrayāni, one's practice will really never get anywhere and one will have obstacles. And if one is tries to practice actual karmamudra with them, performing the creation and completion stage with them as required, it is a root downfall. I don't think 21 Vajrasattvas a day will keep Yama away in that case.

This is why the Tantras such as Hevajra and so on, have instructions on how to train a suitable mudra step by step. Mudra practice also exists in seventeen tantras, so there is no easy out there either.

Crazywisdom said:
But this is about karmamudra. Just having sex isn't relying on a consort.

No, its not just about karma mudra. Read the book. However you free to interpret it anyway you like. I know how it is understood in the traditional context.

I was not giving either dharma or moral advice, I was giving common sense advice. Of course, then there is the question of whether one is sleeping with a non-practitioner or not. It's technically just a branch downfall, if it is just ordinary sex. It's a root downfall, if you are visualizing them as your consort.

I personally still think it is a bad idea, but if both partners are in agreement and the person you are sleeping with has told the other person of their intention to sleep with you, no problem. Just make sure you wear your party hat.

I have however seen situations where one person thinks they are in a monogamous relationship, and the partner who wants to step outside the relationship claims to the new love interest they are in an open relationship. Now, this is not a case of sexual misconduct on your part, because you were misled, but it is sexual misconduct on their part. Sexual misconduct includes "adultery" in its non-legal sense, that is, when a person screws around on someone with whom they have a monogamous commitment.

I recently received the jenang of the Lion Faced Dakini (Simhamukha) coming from Bari Lotsawa to Chogye Trichen Rinpoche and then my guru.

I was wondering if there are any resources on the deity, the practice or the history available?

Malcolm wrote:
From the text

Lobsang Chojor said:
When Bari Lotsawa was in Nepal, he debated the tīrthika Bhavyarāja. Since he was defeated Bhavyarāja, the latter became angry and said, "You will die in seven days through a maledictory mantra!"

The Lotsawa scoffed. The tīrthika said, "You must abandon your deity, the Three Jewels, and convert to doctrine and burn your text with the golden wrap in the fire."

Bari Lotsawa said, "This life is impermanent and short, won't enter your doctrine, nor will I abandon the deity, the Three Jewels"

In order to force Bari's death, the tīrthika said, "You will exhibit death in seven days."

Bari scoffed again and reported this story to his guru, Vajrāsanapāda. Vajrāsanapāda said, "I have a method. Make offerings to the Three Jewels, and prepare a feast offering for the ḍākinīs and supplicate them!" Ha

Having been foretold that the ḍākinīs would come, Bari carried out the instruction, and at midnight, Ḍākinī Siṃhamukha, with the eye of gnosis, arrived in the sky in front of him, in the center of a fire. She said "There is no need to scoff, underneath a boulder shaped like a yak at Vajrāsana, there is the so-called "wealth practice of all the ḍākinīs", also called "a longevity practice,"  and called "a repelling rite for repelling the mighty and powerful," the supreme protection against weapons and the crusher of enemies. If there is a mandala, it will wil free from from the destruction of the evil māras. It assists in protection from all gods and demons. It will cause those who use mantras of power and malediction to vomit blood. It will prevent harm from poison and weapons. One cannot be harmed even by the practice of a thousand mantrins. Since one will sleep happily, it is enough. Since it is an instruction that is auspicious and effective, take it out and promulgate in a single lineage. One should not engage in the meditation and recitation for more than a week. If one practices without breaks and without speaking, the signs will come." The she vanished.

The lotsawa went to that place, and there was such a boulder, and under the boulder, there was a golden box. In that box was the heart essence of ten million ḍākinīs written on red silk. When Bari removed that, a great apparition appeared. Bari wrote that down in gold letters and wore it on his body. Since he recited the mantra for seven days. the tīrthika vomited blood and died.

Having heard that the tīrthika died, he related the story to Guru Vajrāsanapāda. The Guru said, "You didn't die, but if he hadn't died, it would have been better. It is not correct to slay tīrthikas, even though they have entered an errant path. It would have been sufficient for you to merely wear the mantra on your body. The disciple did not really listen to the guru. Since you recited the mantra, he died. Since you have to purify this misdeed, you should sponsor some teachings."

Malcolm wrote:
There you have it. This is the origin story of Siṃhamukha practice in Bari Lotsawa's lineage, according to the Sakya Thirteen Golden Dharmas, which is the tradition you received as written by Namkhai Palzang in the sgrub thabs kung btus. This is from the text your lama probably used. There is a slightly  longer story set down by Tsharchen with more details at the beginning of the cycle. It looks like the account Khyentse Wangpo received and was set down in the Rinchen Terzod garbles some details present in Tsarchen's account.

There are also minor differences between the account above and Tsarchen's such as there being several boxes, one of agate, one made of "rhinoceros hide," one made of bodhitree wood, one made of silver, one made of gold, one made of turquoise, one made of sapphire, and one made of ruby, one inside the other other.

I agree with Malcolm it's better to pronounce the mantra correctly from the beginning. The lesson is not that one should pronounce them how you received them but to recite mantra with faith and confidence, free from doubt.

Yes, this is an important point. That's why even Sapan allowed that mantra recited with full confidence and devotion, even if a bit wrong, would be effective.

The Chilli Chilaya story is just a bit of Nyingma butt hurt meant to denigrate Sapan's text, "How to pronounce Mantras" in his collected works. In that text he also covers Sanskrit regional pronunciations. The man had 30 Indian pandita tutors and spoke fluent Sanskrit, despite having never visited India. He was more Indian than Tibetan. Since Sapan was quite famous even in India, six tirthika panditas came to Tibet to debate him and lost,.  He was also extremely handsome and charismatic, leading to no small amount of jealousy on the part of his detractors.

Gyalpo Rinpoche told me that the Drikung War with Sakya was entirely Drikung's fault. What he shared with me was that someone misheard Sapan talking about Jigten Sumgon, for whom Sapan had tremendous respect, even though there were points of disagreement. This man went back to Drikung and spread a false rumor that Sapan was slandering Jigten Sumgon. The rest is history.

There are some mantras, like Black Mañjuśrī, which are clearly not all Sanskrit, same for the Kilaya "razor mantra." Especially in protector practices there are a lot of mantras that are mixed Sanskrit and Tibetan. Believe it or not, Dilgo Khyentse advised the Vajradhātu translators to translate the Tibetan words into English and recite those with English mixed with Sanskrit. Black Mañuśrī has "snying mgo la chod" in the mantra meaning "sever the heart and head." Imagine handing that out to beginners.

All I meant by 'subjective' here is that no one except a highly trained teacher or a Bodhisattva can know what another person's mental state is.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, correct, and part of that training is learning how to discover these mental factors that are associated with contemplative states experientially, so one can guide others. While it is not rocket science, it is knowledge that is earned with a lot of sweat equity and guidance from qualified people, like Meido, and so on. I have heard good things about Guo Gu as well. There are a number of Korean Son centers out there as well.

I am a Tibetan Buddhist, so, I am not that familiar with the Chan/Zen/Son scene in the US.

But the basic principles are the same: find a teacher, rely on their guidance, do as much retreat as one's life will permit; most importantly, be humble. Buddhadharma is so vast, no one can master it all. But that is not necessary, all one has to do is stick with one qualified practice in a qualified lineage under the guidance of a qualified teacher/s, and then one will generate true bodhicitta, overcome one's afflictions, understand emptiness, and rouse great compassion for all sentient beings, with a bit of concerted effort and study. When all this is complete, one can say one is really on the Mahāyāna path of liberation

My advice, especially with Zen and Chan, is that there are a lot of fools out there pretending to be internet Zen masters, teachers of "Nonduality" and so on, who are really just bolstering their own egos and lining their pockets. Avoid them like you would avoid sleeping with someone who has syphilis. Not everyone with a book published by Wisdom or Shambhala is really a qualified teacher.

It's never a slight against one's teacher to correctly practice the Dharma. It says in no sūtra or tantra anywhere that there is a penalty for correctly pronouncing mantras. There are statements concerning mumbling, not reciting clearly, and so on.

Tibetans cannot pronounce, without retraining, the syllble ṣa in the middle of a mantra. They cannot make that sound, thus bhaiṣajya, always is pronounced bhekhenze, aṣṭa is also akha, etc. Most of these errors come from Tibetans reading transcriptions of Sanskrit, but relying on the Tibetan pronunciations of ཙ་ཚ་ཛ་ཥ, which are used to represent ca, cha, ja, and ṣa. Sounds English speakers generally have trouble with are ṛi, ḷi, ṭa, ṭha, ḍa, ṇa, and ṣa. Also Tibetan regularly confuse བ་when it is used for va, rather than ba, since in texts often Tibetan transcriptions do not use the full ཝ་ , but short hand, བ, leading to pronunciations such as badzra for vajra, etc., or in extreme cases benzar. We and Tibetans also have a hard time with long and short vowels, a and ā, for example.

And he ran into Sakya Sapan who corrected his pronunciation saying he should say it closest to Sanskrit Kili Kilaya. After he had doubt and lost his Siddhi. Then he went back to saying it his way and got his faith and power back. The moral of the story is that faith is the more important factor than technical accuracy.

There is two schools of thought about this. I prefer Sakya Pandita's advice on this issue. He says that while one may achieve results though mispronounced mantras, if one has sincere faith, even so the result will be much slower. If you pronounce them clear and correctly, the result will be faster.

Some lamas insist that you have to pronounce mantras the way they are received, but this makes no logical sense at all. Why? Because someone did not correctly pronounce the mantra they received from the original Indian master who introduced them to the mantra.

The Chilli Chilaya story never happened. It also makes no sense. There is a similar story about the Fifth Dalai Lama who saw an old lady from his window doing korwa around a stupa. She also had an umbrella of light over her head. So he disguised himself and went to ask her what her practice was. She said "Kalacakra." He asked how she was pronouncing that mantra, and it was wrong. So he corrected her, and the next day he saw that her umbrella had disappeared, so he ran down and told her that he made an error, etc. you get the drift. This is also just an excuse Tibetans make for poor pronunciation.

Malcolm wrote:
These things are not subjective.

Dhyāna/samādhi/samapatti states, in Buddhadharma, are defined by specific mental factors which arise in predictable and repeatable fashions.

These things are discussed in Abhidharma, which concerns the first principles upon which Mahāyāna exegesis, including Chan/Zen are predicated.

The observation of the arising, abiding, and passing away of concepts in the mind is an instruction for beginners in every school of Mahāyāna Buddhism, at least those that actually engage in the cultivation of śamatha and vipaśyanā.

Further, there are many manuals, such as Asanga's text on śamatha, Kamalashila's manuals on cultivation and so on, as well as a very influential set of meditation manuals, which had great influence on people like Dogen, etc., by the fifth century Chinese master Chih-I. You should study them (which a teacher).

Buddhism has an extremely rich literature on contemplative phenomenology, if you will, a literature that most people have no access to, because most of it is still locked away in Sanskrit, Pali, Tibetan, Chinese, and Japanese. Further, all of the great masters spent years mastering these curriculums, combining their study with practice. This is why your post and subsequent remarks have met with general incredulity. You are simply out of your depth here.

Since you are a modern, educated person, you have the Western attitude that somehow these pre-modern systems, which are not based on a modern medical understanding of anatomy and physiology, need to be helped in some way, an attitude that is frankly mere cultural chauvinism, not grounded in any facts. For example, while in Tibetan medicine they did not recognize things such as neurons, etc., they certainly were aware of circulation, the connection between the brain, sense organs, and the functions of limbs and organs in the body via nerves, since at least the 10th century (they dealt with a lot of traumatic injuries from warfare, and their methods of diagnosing organ and brain damage from traumatic injuries are remarkable and accurate). One of the consequences of this attitude is that you feel, based on a couple of short, classical texts, that you have somehow grasped the entirety of Buddhadharma and are now in a position to offer your esteemed opinion on such matters, arrogating to yourself the position of having discovered "a brand new method of using the the 4NT as a skillful means." You haven't discovered anything new.

Even more ridiculous, you somehow insist that if your English phraseology is not found in classical texts, somehow this validates your so-called "discovery," as if all this is merely an exercise in creating a computational algorithm based on your conceptual observation of rising, abiding, and passing away of thoughts. You certainly do not know how to do meditation according to Buddhist instructions. You do not know how eliminate lethargy, nor avoid agitation, and a hundred other flaws and obstacles one confronts in meditation. You are talking to people, who in some cases, have spent years in solitary retreats practicing between 10-12 hours a day for extended periods of time.

Malcolm wrote:
This is not the meaning of the term "pratītyasamutpāda." Dependent origination is not mutual or inter- dependence.

In Buddhadharma, there are three schemes of causation: general causation is covered under the the six causes and the four conditions. One of those causes is called kāraṇahetu, which means generative cause, it is also called the dominant condition. What is a generative cause? It means that all things are causes of all other things apart from themselves. It is therefore, not an efficient cause, but rather, a formal cause. You can read about these six causes and four conditions in Abhidharma.

The next causal scheme is dependent origination. The Buddha taught that dependent origination does not apply to inanimate things, only to living beings. The general theory is "Where that exists, then this exists. From the arising of that, this arises." The specific theory is the twelve limbs, which have four presentations: static, serial, momentary, simultaneous.

The final theory of causation is karma and its results.

There is no magical connection which transfers a butcher's karma to me, no chain of karma, per se, unless I actually order a butcher to slaughter an animal on my behalf, see it butchered on my behalf, or hear of it was butchered on my behalf.

If what you say is true, then every vegetable one consumes is also attended by someone's intention somewhere to produce food and prevent other sentient beings from eating it by killing them, before that food is sent to market for consumption.

Your logic is very faulty from the point of view of karma. If you want to discuss the economics of industrial agriculture, its deleterious environmental impacts, its contribution to climate change, water pollution, soil degradation, and so on, that's a completely different conversation, and one I am happy to have.

KathyLauren said:
No one is suggesting that one person's karma is transferred to another.  I am talking only about your karma.  You craved meat.  Therefore you purchased it.  Therefore the store will stock it again in future.  Therefore the butcher will kill again in future.  That is a chain of actions that you set in motion, intentionally.  None of it is incidental or inadvertent.  It is your intention that that happen.  So it is your karma.  No number of middlemen can insulate you from the fact that it is your intention that the killing be carried out.

Malcolm wrote:
No, this represents a gross misunderstanding of karma and its results.

I am not responsible for what a butcher does unless I direct him or her to engage in killing directly. Likewise, even if I see a person killed in front of me, unless I ask for that person to be killed, or approve of the action, it is not my karma.

I don't approve of killing of animals for food,actually. I also think it is wasteful to just dump their carcasses in a landfill.


KathyLauren said:
I am familiar with all the rationalizations that Buddhist carnivores use to pretend that they have no responsibility.  None of them are valid.  You are responsible.

Malcolm wrote:
It is not a rationalization, it's a fact, from a karmic point of view.

I accept responsibility for my participation in the world economy, and I know, for a fact that even if I did not eat meat, not one less animal would die because of my choice, nor would one more animal die because I eat meat. The fact is that the supply of meat, poultry, etc., outstrips its demand by a considerable and significant margin. There is no "just in time" slaughtering of animals.


KathyLauren said:
No sentient beings are intentionally killed for my vegetables.  I grant that some die by accident.  That is unfortunate.  But unlike the production of meat, it is not intentional.

Malcolm wrote:
You cannot make that argument for produce and grain purchased in a market. Virtually no one, unless they grow and can all their own food can make this claim. Grain production is responsible for the deliberate killing of millions of animals and billions of insects every year, and none of those deaths are accidental, none of the violence wrought upon those creatures is accidental. The principle fertilizer for rice grown in the West is feather meal, etc.

KathyLauren said:
The arguments about environmental degradation, climate change, etc. are valid, but I agree they are not the subject of this discussion.  Which is why I did not raise them.  You should not either.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, they should be raised, because the argument that there is a karmic burden from eating meat pure in three ways is a faulty.

There are many humanitarian reasons not to eat meat. There are so health reasons not to eat meat. There are many environmental reasons not to eat meat. There are many reasons related to economics and social justice not to eat meat. But there are really no valid reasons not to eat meat that is pure in three ways, when we are confining the conversation to what the Buddha has said on the subject, and masters such as Bhavaviveka.

Buddha did not teach us that a) karma was destiny and b) that liberation was related to our diets.

The issue, again, is not eating. It is killing. Because people do not really understand karma, they import all kinds of strange notions into their understanding. The Buddha did not list meat-eating under the ten nonvirtues, only killing. And to be involved in that nonvirtue one has to either kill a being oneself or deliberately, volitionally, encourage someone to do so. Picking up a chicken breast does not meet that test. It simply doesn't. That is why the Buddha taught that it was permissible to eat meat pure in three ways.

If you wish to understand this in a more precise way, then consult chapter 4 of the Abhidharmakośabhaṣyaṃ.

If we accept your idea, even organic agriculture involves you in killing for food, due to use of pesticides and so on. But vegetarians always come up with excuses for why it is not the same...forgetting that the Buddha forbade monastics to farm because of the number of creatures killed by the occupation of farming—from tilling to harvesting. But someone has to grow food so people can eat. Thus we have this idea of the golden age, where we lived off fruit from trees, uncultivated grain crops, and so on, where our food consumption involved no nonvirtue on the part of anyone. But we do not live in that world.

When you look back at the history of the development of Buddhism in, say China, where do you see this kind of segregation taking place? I guess Dogen should have stayed in Japan.

Malcolm wrote:
You are not practicing Chan or Zen. You cannot practice Chan or Zen by reading a book and then trying to meditate. Chan and Zen are oral traditions in which working with a teacher is not only recommended, but is mandatory. The same is true of Theravada, Tibetan Buddhism, and so on.

JimTempleman said:
If that were the case throughout the history of Buddhism there would only be a single linage. Don't teachers adopt skillful means suitable to each individual?

Malcolm wrote:
You are not a teacher, or so you have said. Also, this is overblown. The teachings are not adapted to persons, they are adapted to afflictive profiles and levels of intelligence. We have three afflictions, desire, hatred, and ignorance, and everyone has some mixture of these. When it is said there are 84,000 dharma skandhas, this is reference to the teachings meant to address these three afflictions, separately and combined. These afflictions cause us to engage in actions, and those actions result in suffering in this and future lives. In general, we practice three trainings: discipline to counteract desire; samādhi to counteract hatred; and wisdom to counteract ignorance. Practicing discipline eliminates rebirth in the three lower realms. Practicing samādhi eliminates rebirth in the desire realm; and practicing wisdom eliminates rebirth in the three realms altogether. This is from the point of view of our own personal benefit. Developing bodhicitta, the wish to attain full buddhahood for the benefit of sentient beings involves practicing the six perfections for the benefit of others.

The whole point of the Dharma is to reverse this cycle of endless, uncontrolled rebirth in the three realms, both for ourselves and for others. If one does not accept rebirth, there is no point in practicing Buddhadharma at all, because one is negating the very point of practicing Buddhadharma to begin with.

JimTempleman said:
And how you exactly do you keep them from learning through experience?

Malcolm wrote:
Even the Buddha had to deal with Māra when he was on the seat of awakening. We have far more issues with Māra than the Buddha, since we are still ordinary, unawakened people, and our capacity for being deceived is far greater than our capacity to ascertain where we have erred. Every tradition of Buddhadharma has many teachings concerning experience, and how to judge an authentic experience from a deceptive experience (most of them). The problem is that, without a teacher, one will be unable to ascertain the difference, just a person with no knowledge of jungle plants will be unable to ascertain which ones will sustain them and which ones will kill them.

Something happened that night that transformed  Gautama into the Buddha. Let's not argue about what it was this time, just accept that it was a change.

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddha gave a very detailed account of his awakening. So there is no need to argue what it was. It is quite well known.

He first recalled 90k+ lifetimes, understood that these lifetimes were a result of karma, suffering. He then entered into the eight dhyānas to eliminate traces for rebirth in their corresponding lokas, but seeing for each of them that they were suffering, that there was a cause for that suffering, there was a cessation for that suffering, and a means to bring about that cessation. He then entered Vajropama Samadhi, eradicated all traces connecting him with samsara. That's it and that's all. No altered states of consciousness, etc. There was also an episode with Papayin Māra, aka Kamadeva, just prior to his final awakening.

Samadhi, concentration, etc. create traces in rebirth in ordinary people. This is why it is said by many awakened masters prajñā must be cultivated first. What is prajñā? Right view, the first of the eight limbs of the path of nobles.

Observing the rising, abiding, and passing away of thoughts is not in itself profound. Even a child can do this. That does not constitute right view. Right view is discussed here:

https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitak ... an.html#s1

If you wish to understand what samādhi is in Mahāyāna, then you should consult this sūtra, in particular chapter 13.

In the market analysis  monks and other persons are nameless individuals called consumers of goods. Because this market exists, it can be known how much meat has to be produced in the coming years to satisfy the market need for it. The consumption of meat is the driving force, it causes the production of meat, i.e. the raising and slaughtering of animals and processing their meat. The market is not really concerned with the volitions of the meat consumers. The volitions of consumers do not change the mechanism of it. As long as people want to eat meat, there is the market for it. Monks and other people are equally just nameless consumers, whose habits create the demand for meat, right now and in the future.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct, but prohibition is not against eating meat, it is against killing. Meat does not suffer. It’s dead flesh. One can’t kill it. Seeing, requesting, or killing an animal for meat involves karma and it’s result. Buying a steak in the market does not. The market argument is a valid one from the point view of climate change etc., but it’s irrelevant to liberation.

Aemilius said:
The animal has been killed because of one's desire for meat. It is the functioning of the market. Demand creates production. Consumers do not directly kill animals, but their habit of eating meat causes the slaughtering of animals. If no one wanted to eat meat, the animals would not be killed.  The market is caused by one's desire for meat. Buying a steak keeps the market going.

Malcolm wrote:
If people stopped killing  animals for food (fat chance of that happening), then there would be no meat to purchase. I would be fine with that. Hydrocarbon extraction is also killing the planet, but no one is going to stop driving anytime soon, or using the internet to vocalize their deeply-felt opinions, so, we mustn’t pretend that being vegetarian is saving any being from anything. Also, there is no relationship between diet and liberation.

My point is, how can someone know if they are in samādhi if they cannot define it? What are its characteristics? These things are very precisely defined by in Buddhadharma. There are very precise indicators for what a samādhi is, and what a samādhi isn't. There are also very many different kinds of samadhis, hundreds and thousands of them.

It's not a bad thing to embrace your own cultural heritage as a good thing. It only gets bad if it goes too far.

PadmaVonSamba said:
Isn’t the concept of “my heritage”, which means everything created by other people in the past, basically plagiarism?

Heimdall said:
Whether you like it or not, your own cultural experience defines who you are and how you perceive the world.


I mean let's look at you - you worked in an incense shop. The idea of that in my cultural experience is totally foreign; here in the West people don't generally do that. Yet all those experience, all the incense smells you've experienced, the people you've worked with - to some extent, they all are a part of who you are. Without your culture, you wouldn't have been Buddhist, because your ancestors gave you the necessary foundation stones to find Buddhism.

So you should be thankful for your ancestors for that.




As another example, if you are born and raised in a Western country, most people are not genuinely aware of how much the Judeo-Christian framework consciously and unconsciously influences their perceptions, down even to the level of political movements and socio-political philosophy, conceptions of "good" and "evil", and down even to the level of basic cultural custom.

Elaborating that, in Christianity, unlike any other religion in the world, the lower-classes are seen as having intrinsic moral value due to the fact that they suffer more and they less prone to being slaves to materiality. "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven", "It's easier for a camel to enter through the eye of a needle than a rich person to enter the Kingdom of Heaven". Additionally, both Judaism and Christianity have this utopian fantasy where the world will eventually collapse, and the good will enter the Heavenly Jerusalem.

In my understanding, this conception of "the moral superiority of the lower classes" is totally alien to Buddhism. The Buddha himself was an upper-class prince. Sure, we should help the poor, and sure, the upper classes may be prone to spiritually destructive practices (In the Buddha's own words, "living like a Deva"), but everyone here has karma to work out and should strive to achieve enlightenment. There's nothing inherently valuable about being lower class or morally evil about being upper class - a Buddhist king has to keep the eight precepts anyways. And the place we find ourselves in are a product of Karma anyways.


But given the background of Judeo-Christian values, is it any wonder why Marx, and his contemporary disciples, have totally embraced this worldview of "oppressor and oppressee" by various identity groups where the oppressee, by virtue of being oppressed, is seen as morally superior? Or that Marx and his followers have this utopian vision about the social structures collapsing and ushering in an egalitarian utopia like some kind of Heavenly Jerusalem on Earth? The only reason why these political frameworks got such a holding in the West is likely a product of Judeo-Christian values where "good" is defined as "poor, oppressed, detached, meek" and bad is "rich, powerful, greedy, Caesar", and the relatability of the corrupt world withering away and a perfect one coming in.

Even down to expressions like "God bless you" when someone sneezes or "God damn it" or "What the hell", all products of Judeo-Christian influence.

Here are a few examples that caught my eye.  I'm sure I glossed over more.

Drung, Deu, and Bon

Chapter 1, part 4, quoting from "Birth In Ling"



Of course, I notice these are all quotations from the same text.  I assume there are at least shades of meaning that distinguish the above from the below:

Chapter 8, section 1:

(p 106)

Malcolm wrote:
"Oh great, pure, divine race!"  (p 6)

lha sde dkar po: here "pure" is translating dkar po, or "white." sde is not usually translated as race. It is basically a military term, and means "division, section, or segment." But given the context, I see why Adriano has chosen race (usually given for rigs).

"let the pure (dkar po) people of Ling sing and dance!" (p 7)
"the deities have chosen a man from among the pure (dkar) Ling." (p 9)
"may his birth be like an ornament for the pure (dkar po) Ling!" (p 9)

"Dkar po" here as denotes good, virtuous, etc.

"as men do not distinguish good from evil, and do not know how to maintain purity (gtsang) and avoid impurity (dme), they create a basis for negativity"

gtsang here has the connotation of moral purity, chastity, proper sexual conduct; while dme has the connotation of adultery and incest.

Yes, he was being less than inspiring.

Here, I am pointing out the cause of lack of success in Vajrayāna practice (lack of devotion to one's guru as a buddha in fact), and for those who care to see it, the remedy (devotion to one's guru as a buddha in fact).

On the other hand, Nāgārjuna stated in the Pañcakrama:

When falling off of a mountain peak, 
some think they are not falling, even though they are falling 
When the beneficial instruction of the guru is received,
some think they are not liberated, even though they are liberated.

Generally speaking, this is sound. This is why we both agree beginners should, if possible, rely on lineage heads when seeking empowerments.

You will certainly agree that there can be no mahāmudra realization without complete devotion to one's guru. Most people do not have that level of devotion, especially in the beginning, and usually only because of past life cultivation of the Vajrayāna path. Hence the reason we regularly make aspirations to encounter our guru in lifetime after lifetime. And, as we know, people usually overestimate their own level of competency.

The point missed here is that bhumis do not refer to realizations, paths do. Bhumis are just measures of qualities.

In terms of awakened people, there is the path of seeing (first bhumi), and the path of cultivation (second through tenth). These two paths make up the ten bhumis. The path of no more learning is buddhahood.

The point is that when one has reached the path of seeing and entered the path of cultivation, buddhahood is inevitable, in some lifetime or another.

So, Dogen was pointing out something important. On the other hand, the realization of a buddha and that of a first stage bodhisattva are not really that different. They have realized the same emptiness. The difference is only the level of cultivation.

That's the point. And it is very clear what the tantras say. For example, the Hevajra Tantra states:

There are many such citations in the tantras. Also Nāgārjuna states in the Five Stages:

Those wishing to practice the completion stage,
should abide well in the creation stage.
The method is the gradual path
said by the Buddha to be like a staircase.

So here, it is without dispute that Vajrayāna practice is a (comparatively) gradual path for those who do not attain awakening during the empowerment. It would be great if we were all like Saraha and Indrabhūti I, and attained awakening during the empowerment. But we aren't and we don't, and that's why we practice sādhanas, maintain samayas, and so on, the usual work of Vajrayānis. It is also recognized in Dzogchen teachings that most people cannot practice the direct Dzogchen path, as indicated by Mañjuśṛīmitra, and hence we practice the indirect path.

Malcolm wrote:
Appearances (snang ba) are one thing. Apparent objects (yul snang) are another. The former is the basis for the latter. For example, water, amrita, pus and blood, and boiling metal are appearances; the liquid substance upon which these appearances are based is an apparent object.

However, I am not going to continue to discuss this because well, I have better things to do than try and disabuse people of their attachment to views. Especially since they live in the real world, and if their kid was hit by a car they would not be thinking, hmmmm, this is just an appearance of my own mind, therefore, I have no one to sue but my own mind.

They may be more intelligent, more discerning, and have more experience (whatever that means), but outside of Buddhadharma, they don't have correct view. This is why the Buddha declared in many sūtras that outside of his dharma and vinaya, there were no stream entrants, etc., in other words, no awakened people.

Also, he excluded the possibility of pratyekabuddhas while his Dharma was present in the world. Of course, no one is binding you to accept this.

The term "taming" ('dul ba, damya) really refers to the process of obtaining the mental and emotional resilience on a deep level.

Patience (bzod pa, kṣānti) is the quality of resilience you are referring to.

Let’s take the example faith in karma and reincarnation. Ordinary beings cannot directly know it to be true. That “not knowing” is unawareness by definition. However once buddhahood is realized, a being can then see the workings of karma, and faith in that doctrine is no longer an issue.

Malcolm wrote:
Incorrect. There are three sources of authority in Buddhadharma: direct perception, inference, and testimony of reliable witness. As for the latter, since we can trust the Buddha's teachings on the four truths of nobles, we can infer that his teachings on rebirth and karma are correct. Moreover, one does not even need to be an awakened person to have recall of past lives, meaning that anyone who develops sufficient samadhi can observe these things for themselves. Since many yogis and awakens people have indeed confirmed this, we can accept karma and rebirth as true on the basis of that authority. Thus testimony is considered a valid form of knowledge, and therefore, in this instance, faith is not a form of ignorance, but an informed belief. It is only materialists who believe the only valid form of knowledge is direct perception. You are not a materialist, are you?

The term is meant to unify the two truths, not support a mind-only presentation.

You should consult Gorampa's Differentiation of Views, where he disputes Tsonghapa's claim that only the Prasangika Madhyamaka system supports external objects conventionally. Without Gorampa, there is no Mipham or Ganden Chophel, since they largely hew to his presentation of Madhyamaka in general.

And that is also clearly besides the point in this thread. The conventional buddhist position on time is that it depends on outer objects. Specifically it is measurable in units of moments of thought. No outer object, no thought, no time.

A real madhyamaka does not waste time disputing conventional truth. In conventional truth, there are outer objects, hence there is time, etc. We only dispute ultimate existence, not things like vases, pillars, chairs, and so on.

Mipham:

Matt J said:
In reality, if we apply reasoning, then not only at an ultimate level, but also conventionally speaking, arising is never really observed. If production were observable and proven conventionally, then it would follow that conventionally true phenomena such as the aggregates and elements would become immune to ultimate analysis. It would also follow that ultimate or truly existent arising would not be refuted.

Malcolm wrote:
Since Mipham here admits that aggregates and elements are conventionally true, he also admits that outer objects are conventionally true. The aggregate of matter, for example, includes the five sense organs and the five sense objects.



GC:
Matt J said:
There are those who fear that if vases, pillars, and so on were refuted through reasoning, everyone would come to espouse nihilistic views of nonexistence. Their worries are pointless. For in the case of ordinary, everyday beings who are looking at a vase in front of them, how is it possible that a nihilistic view regarding the vase to be utterly nonexistent could arise?

Malcolm wrote:
Here, GC admits there are other objects. How could be otherwise?


Matt J said:
Even if such an outlook did happen to arise in someone, he or she would directly cognize that the vase can still be seen and touched. Therefore, if a mind naturally arose that thinks, "The vase is appearing to me, but while appearing, it is utterly nonexistent," that is the Middle Way view known as "the two-fold collection of appearance and emptiness that cognizes how appearing phenomenon do not exist in the way they appear." How is that nihilism?

Malcolm wrote:
Here, GC also admits there are outer objects. How could it be otherwise? I never maintained that there were truly existent outer objects. I just stated that madhyamakas accept outer objects, as both of your citations show. It matters very little if we call them "clearly apparent nonexistents" as do Mipham and GC, following Gorampa, or "mere existents," following Tsongkhapa and his followers. The point is actually the same.

Personally, I think all this "backwards in time" stuff is taking a metaphor literally. Metaphorically, we compare time to physical objects, such as rivers or land. Accordingly, we can move back and forth along a river or a piece of land, so why not with time?

But time is not like that at all, that is just a spatialized concept. The past is waiting somewhere in the multiverse like our backyard waiting to be discovered. If I were to reify time, I would say everything is always here all at once, and in constant flux. All connection with any sort of past (i.e. memory) occurs here and now.

Such a views winds up with the same contradictions identified in Saṃkhya. The Sarvāstivādins are so-named because they held that "all that exists,"  meaning that past, present, and future all exist simultaneously. Vasubandhu dispenses with the Sarvāstivādin theory in chapter 2 of the Kośabhaṣyaṃ.

From Commentaries on Living by Krishnamurti:
You use discipline, control, as a means to gain tranquillity, do you not? Discipline implies conformity to a pattern; you control in order to be this or that. Is not discipline, in its very nature, violence? It may give you pleasure to discipline yourself, but is not that very pleasure a form of resistance which only breeds further conflict? Is not the practice of discipline the cultivation of defence? And what is defended is always attacked. Does not discipline imply the suppression of what is in order to achieve a desired end? Suppression, substitution and sublimation only increase effort and bring about further conflict. You may succeed in suppressing a disease, but it will continue to appear in different forms until it is eradicated. Discipline is the suppression, the overcoming of what is. Discipline is a form of violence; so through a ’wrong’ means we hope to gain the ‘right’ end. Through resistance, how can there be the free, the true? Freedom is at the beginning, not at the end; the goal is the first step the means is the end. The first step must be free, and not the last. Discipline implies compulsion, subtle or brutal, outward or self-imposed; and where there is compulsion, there is fear. Fear, compulsion, is used as a means to an end, the end being love.

That doesn't sound like shamatha without an object to me, but as it no doubt obvious as the dickens, I'm no expert.

In Buddhadharma, this is called "following objects" and "being distracted."

In stable śamatha combined with mindfulness, one registers sense objects as they arise, but one never follows them. In Dzogchen, one makes contact with all sense objects, but one does not follow them or drift along with them. That is how "one-pointedness" is defined in the latter system.

Which skandha does "nondual awareness" belong to? "Self and other" is a knowledge obscuration, which even tenth stage bodhisattvas have.

Freedom from extremes means being free from reified notion of existence and nonexistence due to not understanding dependent origination. It does not mean rooting around like a dog or a pig in the garbage.

Crazywisdom said:
Self and other is dual. Without these nondual. Skandhas are dual.

Malcolm wrote:
Umm, is one ever without the skandhas? Is there such a thing as a sentient beings that has no skandhas?

Even the Buddha had skandhas. So according to your logic, the Buddha was hopelessly caught in dualism.

The Buddha taught very clearly that freedom from existence and nonexistence, from proliferation of extremes, was his teaching of dependent origination. There really isn't any other kind of absence of duality in the Dharma.

Not especially Kagyu, this is common in all schools. The inner body gives rise to external appearances because there is a correlation between them.

Indifference is not neutral, it’s
Either lazy or non caring.
So to my stupid mind it carries negative intentions.

A non position.. is a position.

PadmaVonSamba said:
Indifference can mean that.
It also means not holding an opinion for or against.

Suppose a hungry stray cat shows up at your door, and you happen to have two cans of cat food. One is fish and the other is chicken.  Out of a sense of caring, you want to feed the cat. Do you care which can you open?  Probably not. You may be totally indifferent as far as which can is opened, as long as the cat is fed.
This shows that indifference itself has nothing to do with compassion.
Indifference towards whether the cat starves or not is a different issue.
Likewise, one can have awareness without picking and choosing, and still practice compassion.

Malcolm wrote:
Practicing compassion is a choice. So no, you cannot have awareness free of choices. You may not care whether you feed a cat tuna or chicken as long as it is fed, but that does not mean your action is "indifferent." The goal of feeding the cat is a choice, the food is secondary. And you do have to choose which can. The cat isn't going to choose for you.

Malcolm wrote:
The three poisons are the cause of grasping, not objects of grasping.

Freedom from the three afflictions arises from recognizing how they are the direct cause of actions that result in suffering. One refrains from grasping objects of desire, for example, because one understands how that leads to the suffering of change. One refrains from grasping objects of anger, understanding how that leads to the suffering of suffering, and one refrains from grasping objects of ignorance, because one understands how that leads to the suffering of pervasive formations.

While that may be true, the subject/object dichotomy is not the same as the subject engaged in “choiceless awareness”.

It’s like, if someone hands me a lunch menu, yes there is a difference between me and the menu. But if I say, “oh bring me whatever—it doesn’t make any difference to me” this is like the meditator who simply observes. And at some point, the distinction between observer and that which is observed (subject and object) becomes moot. When choosing ceases, it ceases to be a cause.

Happy to:
Choiceless awareness is posited in philosophy, psychology, and spirituality to be the state of unpremeditated, complete awareness of the present without preference, effort, or compulsion.
It's a quote from Wikipedia's article on choiceless awareness: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choiceless_awareness and like most Wikipedia articles, it should be taken with a grain of salt. But I think it's quite good.

Key is the choiceless part. Often it only applies to the awareness itself. But Krishnamurti stipulated that everything in the process needed to be fully choiceless:
He did not offer any method to achieve such awareness; in his view application of technique cannot possibly evolve into, or result in, true choicelessness – just as unceasing application of effort leads to illusory effortlessness, in reality the action of habit. Additionally, in his opinion all methods introduce potential or actual conflict, generated by the practitioner's efforts to comply. According to this analysis, all practices towards achieving choiceless awareness have the opposite effect: they inhibit its action in the present by treating it as a future, premeditated result, and moreover one that is conditioned by the practitioner's implied or expressed expectations.
Is there any Buddhist practice that is similar to either of these two flavors of choiceless awareness?

Malcolm, yes, I know the things I mentioned are just the innate purity of the mind, i.e. its emptiness. And I already thought things like the Ground (ghzi) were just upayas, as you seem to suggest.

Seung Sahn tried again, holding out the orange and demanding to know: “What is it?!”... while everyone waited for the old lama to manifest unfettered Mind, he remained silent. Finally, Kalu Rinpoche whispered to his translator. Then the translator said (to paraphrase) “Rinpoche wants to know,”What’s the matter with this guy? Hasn’t he ever seen an orange before?’”

Where do you think that money should have been spent? I know where we ought to have spent it. But as we all know, the war on terror was warped our sense of priorities. We spent years looking for terrorists around the world, only to find the most dangerous terrorists are in our own backyard, tweeking on Qanon meth.

Huh? So who is Amithaba and why does the entire pure land school pray to him to be reborn in Dewachen? Of course you could split hairs and argue that people only do that in order to find perfect circumstances to practice, or that deities are supposed to be not inherently self-existing, or make any other such philosophical statement - but in applied daily life of Buddhists, how is that actually any different from relying on deities in a soteriological manner? The vast majority of Buddhists actually don't give a fig whether the deities to which they pray are as real or not as Hindu deities, only people in this forum do. And, while they might believe to be very representative of Buddhists around the globe, fact is: they aren't. Majority of Buddhists actually don't write or speak English, so you won't find them in this forum.

Vishnu/Narayana resides in Vaikuntha with Lakshmi, the goddess of fortune, in palaces with crystal walls.

The abstract that is publically available there summarises the relevant argument quite well: While there are chiastic structures in both the opening and closing chapter clusters, they also persist throughout the entire sūtra. So, they probably were composed at the same time. That being said, it is possible for such things to be inserted by a redactor into parts that were composed separately.

While many other scholars besides Conze had ur-sūtra theories, claiming that the original core was different parts of the sūtra, I think that most would agree that his claim about the first two chapters is too simplistic. But Conze also admits that the Vajracchedikā, for instance, is not based on any part of the Aṣṭa. A lot of the dhāraṇi and esoteric based Prajñāpāramitā stuff also is not based on the Aṣṭa. But the Heart Sūtra is based on portions of a longer version (25,000 if I recall correctly) which itself is based on the Aṣṭa. So, Conze was not claiming that all of Prajñā literature is based on the first two chapters of the Aṣṭa, but only a certain strand of it.

As such, combined with the 2001 SCOTUS decision concerning the question of whether noncitizens outside the US are entitled to due process, and the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF, P.L. 107- 40), its pretty clear that the US Government considers its decision to detain people in Guantanamo Bay and to kill people like OBL, etc., perfectly lawful. Also, this legitimizes as lawful, in the US Government's eyes, the covert action it took in Pakistan. Also, in the case of OBL's killing, members of Congress were alerted, and as police power rests in the hands of the legislature, as Congress signed off on it, which they did, from the US Government's point of view, all perfectly legal.

Mahayana has twofold divisions: Paramitayana and Mantrayana. The former is explained being based on the philosophy of the Sautrantikas, Yogacaras and Madhyamikas. And the latter is explained being based on the philosophy of the Yogacaras and Madhyamikas.

From another narrative, the Mahayana regards there is only one vehicle; ultimately, even sravaka (both gotras) also enters into Buddha vehicle.  Somewhere Asanga quoted that even Sakyamuni Buddha (or any Buddha) dwelled many eons in Sravaka Nirvana and then ultimately entered into the Buddha vehicle.

Theravada is just a branch of Sravaka vehicles whereas Tibetan Buddhism is just a branch of Mahayana, especially the Vajrayana/Mantrayana; it has several sects (black hat, yellow hat, old one, etc.) lol

The largest concentration of wealth in the US, actually the world, is in Washington DC area).

The success of the Chinese campaign against Tibet, for example, is based on the fact that the CCP always intended to settle the Tibetan plateau with Han Chinese.

There are a few understandings of bodhicitta in Vajrayāna. On the one hand there is "relative bodhicitta" which is aspiring to attain awakening and engaging in bodhisattva behaviour to attain it. "Absolute bodhicitta," on the other hand, is closer to the understanding in Jōdo Shinshū, where it might be understood as a mind that cognises emptiness.

Malcolm wrote:
These two kinds of bodhicitta are common Mahayana teachings. Relative bodhicitta in Vajrayana specifically refers to bindu, the yoga of which cause the realization of ultimate bodhicitta.

The rousing of bodhicitta is always a mind free of affliction, like a lotus that grows from muck, even in an afflicted person. How one rouses it is less of an issue than rousing it. Also, rousing bodhicitta in this life is taken as proof one has done so before. Unlike other vows, which expire at death, bodhicitta vows are only taken once. The afflicted state of an individual is of no consequence at all with respect to rousing of the two bodhicittas. After all, Shakyamuni Buddha first roused bodhicitta in hell.

This is how Āryanāgārjuna is able to declare that all things are, are not, are and are not, and neither are nor are not, and then declare it "the teaching of the many Buddhas." Only the conventional is like this. Ultimately, no one is taught. Conventionally, sentient beings are taught in a rhetorical 84,000 ways. It is a violation of the integrated middle to insist that no one is taught and that the conventional is false. Similarly, it is a violation, or diminution, of the conventional to say that all sentient beings are Buddhas and that they've no need for a basis, a path, a result, etc. As I see things, it's a matter of basic confusion between the two truths.

To those who adopted or accepted the view of rebirth (re-existence as Malcolm pointed out) - what convinced you of this view?

Would you say that it was:

1. something you came to through the logic presented in the canon (e.g, all things emerging from a cause and the example of the light of a candle being the same but not identical) and wouldn’t have accepted it without this presentation

2. something you accepted in a leap of faith/trust (after some reading and contemplation of course)

3. something that is a belief that enables the rest of the tradition you rest follow and respect

But “re-existence” implies “existence” which makes the whole thing easy to be misunderstood.
What I mean by clumsy and misleading is that there needs to be better English language vocabulary to really grasp what is being suggested, otherwise it’s very easy for someone to assume there is a truly existing being who then becomes another truly existing being.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, that's the point of the Buddhist presentation. We accept rebirth, but not rebirth of a soul, etc. We assert rebirth must be predicated on absence of inherent existence, and that it will not work otherwise.

The Indians did not have "better vocabulary" so the Buddhists just worked with what they had before them. Generally, Indians who accepted rebirth (and not all Indians did) assumed there was some essence or entity that went from one life to another. What we are dealing with here in the West is the Shirley Mclaine version of reincarnation, etc.

The Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) reports that Geshe Tenpa Gyaltsen, a Buddhist scholar at Gaden Jangtse Monastery in southern India, who was declared dead some 26 days ago, has shown no signs of physical decay or decomposition. It is believed that the monk has entered a rare tantric meditative state known as thukdam (Tib: ཐུགས་དམ་).

The thukdam state, which has been observed in a number of advanced tantric practitioners in recent years, is a meditative condition in which the individual’s consciousness is believed to remain in the body despite and beyond physical death. This is believed to posptpone the usual signs of decay. Tibetan Buddhist literature describes a glow on the face and warmth in the body of the deceased, making them appear to be alive.

The Tibetan term thukdam is a combination of “thuk,” meaning mind, and “dam,” referring to the meditative state of samadhi or concentration. As recently reported, scientific studies of this state are underway. Most recently in August, the Taiwan-based Tibetan Buddhist monk and scholar Geshe Jampa Gyatso entered the state. Thereafter his body was observed by scientists from Academia Sinica, the pre-eminent academic research institution in Taiwan.

The channels are not physical in the sense of being a part of the gross anatomical structure of the body but they are "embodied" as light, and are the support for the development of our physical form.

Malcolm wrote:
Nah, they are actually just the nerves, arteries, blood vessels, lymphatic system, and other passageways of the body, spoken of in a concealed way in the tantras. "Light" is not a sixth element.

Jangchup Donden said:
So then what is light? Some combination of fire and air?

Malcolm wrote:
Ordinary light is a product of either combustion or chemical reaction (fire flies), etc.

When we practice a deity, we imagine that it is in the form of light, but this light is the light of consciousness. We use visualizations to manipulate our physical body to produce various results, to experience various kinds of bliss, overcome illnesses, and so on. Sentient beings are composed of six things: earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness. Apart from these six dhātus, there is nothing else out of which sentient being is formed. It's pretty simple.

When one becomes accustomed the Buddhist view of the elements as well as the formation of the body, then much speculation vanishes.

If someone holds that there are no physical correlates to nāḍīs, vāyus, and bindus, then they must admit such visualizations are entirely imaginary and have no basis in conventional reality and no effect on the body.

Not only does such an assertion harm the basis of Vajrayāna teachings in general, it harms Dzogchen teachings as well. People who maintain such a view and call their practice "mahāmudra" or "atiyoga" are just practicing sutrayāna śamatha and vipaśayanā, which of course have no profound methods connected with the body. It is a farce to then discuss the harm to the body maṇḍala which may be entailed by surgery, suicide, and so on, since such a maṇḍala will also be just an imaginary conceptual construct.

Certainly someone might decide that this presentation of the universe is medieval, does not correspond with scientific materialism and so on. That's perfectly fine. But then it does not make much sense for them to engage in the creation stage and completion stage, ganacakras to please imaginary ḍākinīs, torma offerings to imaginary dharmapālas, and so on, nor to engage in the practice of caṇḍḹī yoga, karmamudra, and so on, much less trekcho and thogal.
