You cannot divulge someone else's practice, only they can do this.

Moreover, in some schools, but not all, there is the principle of self-secrecy, that is, things only make sense if you have received instruction in this or that practice, something you cannot get from a book.

In general, Greg, there are no secrets anymore. It has all been published. Not every detail of every cycle of practice, but there is very little difference between one cycle and another in terms of the general outlines of creation and completion stage.

This is largely a show among Tibetans, since you can walk into any Tibetan monastery and see all the Yidams, Mandalas, implements and so on, since Vajrayāna is the state religion of Tibet.

In the end, it is up to you.

Your claim is similar to the mistaken assertion made by some who claim that Candrakirti never resorts to syllogisms, which in fact he clearly does in the opening lines of the MAV. What Candra disputes is not syllogistic reasoning in its entirety, but rather, syllogistic reasoning applied to emptiness.

Well, Astus, why do you find a qualified Guru and find out for yourself.



Astus said:

Wisdom first needs to be attained - hence the movement from ignorance to knowledge. Then, with that knowledge, that wisdom or pristine consciousness, one can progress on. That's what happens in all paths, where one goes from ordinary being to a noble one, and from noble practitioner to a non-practitioner. Unless it is the sudden enlightenment version, where with one step one goes from ordinary to buddha.

And then there is the third option. Pristine consciousness is innate. The stage of liberation is first. Vajrasattva lost his jewel, and needed to find it again.

How is direct perception certain? We all see that the sun goes up and down. Does the sun actually go up and down? Or do you mean that first hand experience of the validity of the teachings is better than only believing in it based on a level of theoretical confirmation? If so, then I see no difference between the vehicles, they all point to seeing the truth for oneself. At the same time, isn't it the case that in the nine vehicles scheme all that the lower vehicles assume to be direct realisations are actually false? That is, it just shows how direct perception is uncertain.

I did not suggest that. Of course faith is necessary. But it is not sufficient.

Also Vajrayāna, in general, is a path which is based in mind and intellect, and not the direct perception of pristine consciousness.

The difference of course is that Vajrayāna has many sure methods for attaining awakening in this life with this body. The Pure Land traditions, being based in sūtra, have none of these. This is especially the case in Jodo Shinshu, where such methods are eschewed as being jiriki, self-powered.

Vajrapani himself towards the end of his life went to Tsang in Tibet together with his disciple Dharmashri and taught mahamudra to several Tibetan disciples, this lineage was known as upper or western mahamudra.

You will recall, the dividing line between Sūtra and Secret Mantra is empowerment. You will also recall that the mahāmudra we are discussing does not even belong to lower tantra (Mahāmudra in lower tantra refers to the commitment to mediate one's body as the body of the deity).

And as I have repeated already, this sūtra mahāmudra was elaborated for those who did not have the capacity for Vajrayāna, as can be easily verified  by reading Kongtrul's description of sūtra mahāmudra.

The story with naked buttocks in the earlier (prior to Tsangnyon Heruka) sources happens between Milarepa and Rechungpa. Also there was no sun and moon disciple prior to Tsangnyon. Whatever his reason might have been Tsangnyon Heruka clearly altered the whole Milarepa - Rechungpa and Milarepa - Gampopa story. Older materials also mention that Milarepa had several human consorts. Again this was played down by monastic Kagyu traditions, so much so that some Kagyu lamas even claimed that Milarepa was celibate.

If we accept "12 nails" and "Clarification of Primordial wisdom" as Milarepa´s texts, these are texts on mahamudra. 12 nails is a short text that specifically deals with view, practice, conduct and fruit of mahamudra. Also there are texts on mahamudra by Rechungpa for example his famous cycle on six-fold equal taste. I agree that Gampopa greatly expanded on mahamudra teachings, but based on the existence of these texts predating or independent of Gampopa´s work I doubt that mahamudra practice system was his own invention. Sutra mahamudra was, but the essence mahamudra was not. Of course the attribute of the "essence" is also of Gampopa´s making, but what I mean here is was not the title, but the practice system as such.

Malcolm wrote:
So therefore any text on mahamudra that does not mention the two stages proves mahamudra is an independent tradition from vajryana in general? I dont think this good reasoning.

Corruption, inequality, grievous pollution, political repression suitable to a paranoid and insecure regime... the CPC has made a real mess of the place, knows it, and is constantly looking over its own shoulder to ensure that no one learns the details.

History has a way of coming back around on itself.  The Tibetan genocide has not been accounted for, nor is the current repression of Tibetans in China.  No institution can attack Dharma and Dharma practitioners in a systematic way and expect good results.  Who knows what the karmic consequences of supporting the "Shugden" scene may be.

The triumphalism over a rising China should be checked with a healthy skepticism.  Yes, China is rising, but on what foundation and in what direction and to what end?

I remember Brunnhölzl making the point that Gompopa's Mahamudra was based on the Uttaratantra, and therefore Buddha Nature. I don't remember if it was specific to sutra, essence, tantric, or all three.

Lama Jampa Thaye mentioned that recently:

Lama Jampa Thaye said:
Gampopa was very learned in the Uttara–Tantra Shastra, the teaching by Maitreya to Asanga; it is a teaching in 5 texts, but the fifth and most important of them is called the Supreme Continuity, or Uttara-Tantra Shastra. It is a text dealing with Buddha-nature. Having contemplated this teaching also, Gampopa again came to the conclusion that what was taught about in the Uttara-Tantra -as the Buddha-nature, the actual fundamental nature of our mind- and what is taught about in the Mahamudra is, in essence, one point. As he said to his disciple Pagmodrupa: “Our Mahamudra is as the Mahamudra expressed in Maitreya’s Uttara-Tantra.”
This is a very, very extraordinary understanding reached by Gampopa through his meditation on both the Sutra and the Tantra teachings. You see, his point was this: in the Mahamudra we can distinguish view, meditation and action –that is how it is taught in the Indian songs, in the Indian Mahamudra dohas. The view -as that which is to be realized as the nature of reality- is expressed in this way: all appearances are actually none other than mind itself, but if we look into the mind, we see that the mind’s nature is just like space. It has no beginning, no end, no center, no periphery. If we look into the nature of space, we see it is none other than emptiness. In this way, appearances are mind, mind is space, and space does not go beyond emptiness. This is, for instance, how Tilopa teaches in his song about Mahamudra given at the Ganges. But Gampopa said it is exactly the same teaching that is found in the Perfection of the Wisdom Sutras [editor’s note: Prajnaparamita Sutras] -particularly in the Samadhiraja Sutra- and that is found in the Uttara-Tantra. Therefore, there exists in this way a Sutra transmission of Mahamudra, known as a Mahamudra that is not just derived from the Tantras but is being presented in the Sutra tradition.

I think part of the reason is that  a sense of aesthetic  or spiritual austerity (which some other teachings really rely on) is actually very difficult in this day and age for people to profit from spiritually. On the flipside, people today are already immersed in their senses whether they want to be or not, in that sense Vajrayanas' skillful use of these things fits very well with how people already (have to) live.

Also not all Vajrayana involves elaborate ritual, though that seems to be a big component in lower tantra stuff.

Iconodule said:
I understand that the hypersensual aspect of it can be very appropriate for someone in the modern world, but to actually engage in the practices in depth requires maintaining a relationship with a teacher and a high level of commitment, both of time and effort. And I recognize that some popular practices, like chanting "om mani peme hung", are accessible to anyone and are regarded as highly meritorious, but the same can be said of many sutra Mahayana practices.

Working my way through The Practice of Dzogchen, and came to this passage:

"In Rangshar it is said: "The primordial purity, the basis, is present [in the mode of] essence [entity], nature [character], and compassion [power]." The essence is the ceaselessness of the changeless intrinsic wisdom, and it is called the nature of "the youthful vase body". The nature is the ceaseless appearances of the five lights. The appearance of compassion are [pervasive] like the cloudless sky. These are called the nature of primordial purity as they do not fall into any extremes of dimensions or partialities."

Trying to understand these three modes of the basis.

What is the wisdom?
...the youthful vase body?
...compassion?

These three modes are merely three ways of talking about one thing, pristine consciousness, or as translated here, wisdom.

What happen is that at the time of the so called basis, apparent aspect of the basis, compassion, is reified as subject and object, than at that point the 12 links kick in because the knower in the basis, which is treated as separate from the basis, does not recognize its own appearances as its own state.

A 'real table' is different from an 'illusory table' in that one does not interact with the illusory table in the same way one does with the real table; one can tap on the real table or stub one's toe on it, but one cannot do this with an illusory one. One could perhaps say 'don't worry about tripping over that table, because it's an illusion,' but saying that 'all phenomena are illusions' doesn't seem to provide one with similar practical information about whether or not one could trip over said phenomena. Thus the statement that 'all phenomena are illusions' does not seem to utilise the same sense of the word 'illusion' as the table example does; In saying this one does not seem to be comparing 'all phenomena' with any real phenomenon as one does in the table example.

If all phenomena are illusions, then what would real phenomena be?

If one cannot give a meaningful description of what real phenomena would be, what are we to take a statement such as 'all phenomena are illusions' to mean?

A geshe challenged Milarepa to a debate. He said to Milarepa, "You are a great meditator. Tell us, is space conditioned or unconditioned?"

The Geshe really thought he had caught Milarepa in a gross error, and replied, "How is space conditioned like this rock? The rock offers impediment, space offers no impediment."

Other illustrious Kagyus like Kongtrul are equally clear that sūtra mahāmudra for example is a "mahāmudra" for those who lack the capacity to practice Vajrayāna.

The best you are going to get is that there was a group of Indian masters such as Shri Simha (the Dzogchen master) who taught that the creation stage was not important. One can make an argument perhaps that Maitripa was such a later exponent, but not for Saraha, who was the master who introduced to the Cakrasamvara Tantra to the world.

Well, nobody was arguing about that. Though I think this is rather formalist view, as it stands now Tibetans have mixed guruyoga even into stura practices such as lojong. So who cares?

Malcolm wrote:
Lojong used to be very secret, and it is an error to consider it merely "sūtra."

dzoki said:
Of course one needs an empowerment in order to practice Vajrayana in general, even Kriya tantra practice, but since the core element of guruyoga is faith I believe this practice can be done by anyone, who is interested as long as they have intention to receive the actual empowerment later on and have already received lung and instructions.

Malcolm wrote:
Remember, there is no one in Tibet who has not received some kind of empowerment.

My observation derives from looking at the practice in the text itself. It begins with A, and ends with two A's.

dzoki said:
Also if one has sufficient faith, they can receive the actual empowerment directly from Guru Padmasambhava while doing the practice (though that is probably pretty rare I guess).

Malcolm wrote:
My point really is that if you carefully examine the text, it is the opposite of what most people imagine it to be. Most people imagine it to be some kind of outer Guru Padmasambhava practice that does not require an empowerment. I think it's real import is that it is a guru yoga practice for practicing Atiyoga: after all, the feast portion is in fact a separate text.

One big difference in their approach is the willingness to accept the idea that they won't find the answer to their problem using their own emotional/intellectual resources and willpower. In other words, a willingness to take direction from an external source and not rely on self-will. My Tibetan teachers seem to have a similar approach, and Westerners all seem to agree that's not necessary. We want to do it on my terms, on my preconditions, without giving up any of my ego territory, etc.

I submit the hypothesis that this is possibly problematic.

It is not problematical at all. Buddhas teach according to people's inclinations. That means that people are taught according to their proclivities.

All the following says is that the Buddha is reminding Śariputra of his bodhisattva vows and giving him a prediction for full buddhahood.
Śrāvakayāna is a long route to Buddhahood, very long., etc. All these paths eventually lead to Buddhahood, they are all Buddhayānas. Why? Because they all lead to awakening. Awakening and buddhahood are to different things. The former is necessary for the latter, but paths which produce the former do not necessarily directly produce the former. But they do indirectly, since once one becomes an Arya and is free from birth in samsara, buddhahood is inevitable at some point. So from the point of view of the Indo-Tibetan Mahāyāna tradition, the ultimate goal of all paths is the same — buddhahood, hence, Ekayāna. To quote the Saddharma Pundarika directly:
Due to the skillful means of the Tathāgata, Arhat, Samyak Sambuddha, the single vehicle of buddhahood was taught as three vehicles.
This passage argues that there really aren't three vehicles at all, just one. This is consistent with the Lankāvatara Sutra which asserts that śrāvaka arhats, etc., are roused from the equipoise of cessation and placed on the bodhisattva path to attain buddhahood.

Queequeg said:
It goes further than that, explaining that the Sravakayana was more or less a delusion, and that the Sravkas have always been bodhisattvas...
I declare to thee, Sâriputra, I announce to thee, in presence of this world including the gods, Mâras, and Brahmas, in presence of this people, including ascetics and Brahmans, that thou, Sâriputra, hast been by me made ripe for supreme, perfect enlightenment, in presence of twenty hundred thousand myriads of kotis of Buddhas, and that thou, Sâriputra, hast for a long time followed my commandments. Thou, Sâriputra, art, by the counsel of the Bodhisattva, by the decree of the Bodhisattva, reborn here under my rule. Owing to the mighty will of the Bodhisattva thou, Sâriputra, hast no recollection of thy former vow to observe the (religious) course; of the counsel of the Bodhisattva, the decree of the Bodhisattva. Thou thinkest that thou hast reached final rest. I, wishing to revive and renew in thee the knowledge of thy former vow to observe the (religious) course, will reveal to the disciples the Dharmaparyaya called 'the Lotus of the True Law,' this Sûrânta, &c.

Again, Sâriputra, at a future period, after innumerable, inconceivable, immeasurable Æons, when thou shalt have learnt the true law of hundred thousand myriads of kotis of Tathâgatas, showed devotion in various ways, and achieved the present Bodhisattva-course, thou shalt become in the world a Tathâgata, &c., named Padmaprabha, endowed with science and conduct, a Sugata, a knower of the world, an unsurpassed tamer of men, a master of gods and men, a Lord Buddha...
Saying the Sravakayana leads to Buddhahood is not telling the whole story. Its when the full scope of the matter is revealed that we see the context of the three vehicles.

We're not saying much different. I think you're being a little more polite to those on the Sravakayana than the Buddha is in the Lotus. Later, the Sravakayana is compared to a phantom city conjured by the Buddha for weary travelers. Its awakening is not what its purported to be.

To answer the question whether there's scientifically satisfactory evidence for the rainbow body, a good counter question that Khenpo Sodargye might pose is (in the first place) whether or not Buddhism needs validation from science since it is a science in its own right.

Malcolm wrote:
If by science you simply means an area of knowledge, then I can agree.

But if by science you mean it can stand along with physics, and so on, I have to disagree.

Why? Science in the latter sense depends upon empirical validation of the perceptions of many ordinary people over time under controlled experimental conditions, slowly piecing together this and that kind of knowledge. Buddhadharma on the other hand is entirely revelatory, and is based on faith in the perception of extraordinary people whose perceptions cannot be validated by ordinary people. The validation of those perceptions necessitates that one has oneself transformed into an extraordinary person whose knowledge does not depend on the empirical validation of the perceptions of many ordinary people over time under controlled experimental conditions.

First and foremost, rainbow body is the result of what happens when you eradicate for yourself the fundamental delusion that sustains samsaric appearances. Since the outer and inner five elements are already the five lights of pristine consciousness misperceived, when that misperception is utterly removed, where one once perceived the five elements in all their diversity, one now perceives nothing but a field of light.

smcj said:
Negative thoughts/feelings are kleshas.

From Wiki: Kleshas (Sanskrit: kleśa; Pali: kilesa; Standard Tibetan: nyon mongs,) in Buddhism, are mental states that cloud the mind and manifest in unwholesome actions. Kleshas include states of mind such as anxiety, fear, anger, jealousy, desire, depression, etc. Contemporary translators use a variety of English words to translate the term kleshas, such as: afflictions, defilements, destructive emotions, disturbing emotions, negative emotions, mind poisons, etc.

Malcolm wrote:
No, in point of fact kleshas are mental factors, not minds. There are 26 altogether:

Six root unwholesome factors[edit]
The six root unwholesome factors (mūlakleśa) are:

Raga - attachment
Pratigha - anger
Avidya - ignorance
Māna - pride, conceit
Vicikitsa - doubt
Dṛiṣṭi - wrong view
Twenty secondary unwholesome factors[edit]
The twenty secondary unwholesome factors (upakleśa) are:

Krodha - rage, fury
Upanāha - resentment
Mrakśa - concealment, slyness-concealment
Pradāśa - spitefulness
Irshya - envy, jealousy
Mātsarya - stinginess, avarice, miserliness
Māyā - pretense, deceit
Śāṭhya - hypocrisy, dishonesty
Mada - self-infatuation, mental inflation, self-satisfaction
Vihiṃsā - malice, hostility, cruelty, intention to harm
Āhrīkya - lack of shame, lack of conscience, shamelessness
Anapatrāpya - lack of propriety, disregard, shamelessness
Styāna - lethargy, gloominess
Auddhatya - excitement, ebullience
Āśraddhya - lack of faith, lack of trust
Kausīdya - laziness, slothfulness
Pramāda - heedlessness, carelessness, unconcern
Muṣitasmṛtitā - forgetfulness
Asaṃprajanya - non-alertness, inattentiveness
Vikṣepa - distraction, desultoriness

In order to attain liberation in the degenerate age, an ordinary person needs a practice which is based on the direct perception of dharmatā, rather than intellectual analysis, mind, faith, championing one sūtra or tantra over another, renunciation and so on.

Ekayāna is saying no more and no less than that all Dharma paths have one goal, Buddhahood. It does not however comment on which of those paths is long delayed, indirect, direct, or immediate.

But if you study the nine yānas presentation one can easily ascertain which paths fall where.

Of course people have their karmic dispositions for this and that path, which is why there are so many paths. But when it comes to liberation, one needs a path based on jñāna, not citta.

I used to have a copy of Rubin's Steal this Book, and when I was ten, I was reading Alinsky's Rules for Radicals, Weather Underground's Prairie Fire, as well as Be Here Now, first edition (where I first discovered Padmasambhava).

It would take several decades—and several more smoke-induced “dark days”—before the forest fire theory won wide acceptance. It was finally confirmed in 2007, after researchers from the University of Missouri discovered signs of a massive, centuries-old wildfire in the Algonquin Highlands of southern Ontario. “Fire scars” in the rings of the affected trees allowed the team to date the blaze to the spring of 1780. After studying weather reports from the period, they concluded that low barometric pressure and heavy winds had most likely carried smoke into the upper atmosphere and over the Northeast, blotting out the sun. Evidence shows that a similar phenomenon also occurred in 1881, when the haze from fires in Ontario and Michigan reduced sunlight in New England by as much as 90 percent.

My response thus far has been to turn my attention to a mantra (Amitabha) instead of my aversion and fear.
But if this experience is more in line with an opportunity to bring some benefit to hungry ghosts, I'd very much like to know what I could do.
It seems the mantra either cancels out my fear or drives the beings away.

The "I" is the habit of grasping to the idea of self. It can take the form of grasping to something as a self, or, as it really is, merely a mental habit of thinking "I am."

That habit is not a self, does not belong to a self, and has no self, but it continually carries on imputing a self.

This habit maintains its "individuality" because its causes and conditions are unique to it, just as the causes and conditions that lead from seed to sprout are unique to that series.

This nonexistent I can be an agent of karma and a recipient of ripening of karma, even though it does not exist as such.

I've read and heard a fair amount of Buddhist teaching, but one question I don't recall hearing an answer to is this: Between rebirths there is a single stream of consciousness, so one death leads to one rebirth in one of the six realms depending on the karmic orientation. Why does this mindstream not split up and constitute in several different births? What keeps it from merging with other mindstreams?

The mind stream is an attempt to explain rebirth without self. However, rebirth and karma applies only to those who are attached to the concept of self. Since a self is always unitary, there is no splitting into two selves.

A buddha's mind has no limitations, a buddha also cannot accumulate karma, suffer in samsara, etc. However, in reality, from a Dzogchen point of view, nirmanakāyas are a result of the delusions of sentient being, as Manjuśrimitra says:
Because the awakening of the sugata does not exist, his magical apparitions appear to the deluded, similar to an illusion.
Therefore, an argument can be made that all these emanations just correspond to our own delusion, nothing more, nothing less.

An effect is supported on its causes and conditions. In order for a mind stream to "split" it would have to, in effect, calve itself, produce two instances of itself simultaneously.

Likewise, for merging, one consciousness would have to give up it own causes and conditions, and adopt those of another.

The point is that in the end, the Buddha said that we are owners and heirs of our own karma. If a mind stream split, then this would not be the case, the second person of the split mind stream would be an heir of karma they never produced themselves, etc.

I've read and heard a fair amount of Buddhist teaching, but one question I don't recall hearing an answer to is this: Between rebirths there is a single stream of consciousness, so one death leads to one rebirth in one of the six realms depending on the karmic orientation. Why does this mindstream not split up and constitute in several different births? What keeps it from merging with other mindstreams?

Malcolm wrote:
How can a single instant of consciousness split? It is not made of parts.

Iconodule said:
I'm not talking about an instant but the mindstream that passes from death to rebirth and which, in some Buddhist traditions, undergoes a lengthy intermediate state.

If that were not made of parts, that would imply it cannot dissolve, in which case, wouldn't it have to be considered an abiding self?

Malcolm wrote:
It is a rosary of serial moments, each moment neither the same as nor different from the preceding or the next. There is no way for a stream of consciousness to "split."

So essentially Nagarjuna's explanation of sunyata does not pertain to jnana -- whose emptiness is different, or rather differently approached, than the emptiness of all phenomena at the Sutrayana level, right?

Both stories aim at and succeed in revealing emptiness, but they do it differently, Nagarjuna's context being dependent origination and two truths, Vajrayana/Dzogchen focusing on what is transmitted during empowerment/direct introduction. Am I getting anywhere near?

I agree, but part of that is that simply raising/regulating people's serotonin doesn't fix much of anything, a lot of the studies out there on psilocybin are just looking at it like a biological therapy, similar to SSRIs.

Johnny Dangerous said:
Maybe, but the point is most of these studies are treating the psilocybin like an SSRI or something, studies similar to which BTW I remember reading 20 years ago.

They may be different animals, but what "researchers" (and frankly for some of these you could use that term loosely) are finding is basically that psilocybin raises/regulates serotonin in some ways, which again is not really unusual or controversial, and is done by all kinds of other things - including exercise, sex, supplements of various kinds etc..

Beyond that, stuff that is pleasurable and gives you a huge serotonin bump has it's own risks when done regularly.

I don't know why you are going off on the SSRI thing, I'm not advocating them, I'm pointing out that in most of the studies their things they are looking are related to treating psilocybin like an antidepressant, and that misses the context entirely, because you could do it with any number of chemical or biological things that raise serotonin, and probably get similar results, especially in these small scale studies. What i'm saying is these studies rely on the same silly reductionist model of treating depression that causes your average MD to think that Zoloft will "cure" people's depression. For that reason, to me at least, they are really unconvincing.

Indeed one needs to know the purpose of Khaita joyful dances and there are so many times that Rinpoche insisted that I attend the webcasts.
That is why in return I insist he is a great teacher. I only had to win from him.

If you were to teach me Dzogchen or anything, I was dead and burried by now and a phowa transfer done to me that you forget about later.

Yeah like I said, when something causes a big serotonin bump, it can obviously be used therapeutically for depression..really not controversial, also doesn't say there is anything particularly unique about it. There's is as much or more evidence that exercise (not to mention meditation) can do the same thing AFAIK, and obviously with fewer associated risks.

Not saying yay or nay to psychedelics on an individual basis, just saying, something "treating depression" in this regard is really nothing amazing, and in fact relies mostly on the idea that "treating depression" is mostly about balance of neurotransmitters anyway. If that were true, the boom in use of SSRI's would have entirely cured the American public of their depression. instead, they've gotten worse.

Another definition can be found given by Viryavajra in his commentary on Cakrasamvara Root tantra
Self-originated: since there is arising from the cause and condition of experiencing the intrinsic luminosity of the mind, but not arising from temporary causes and conditions, there is "self-origination."

Hi all,

So I've been trying to wrap my head around the meaning of rang jung lately. Anytime I'm reading Dzogchen-related material, I'm always seeing the terms "Self-existent" or "self arisen" or "spontaneously existing" (I'm assuming these are all different translations of rangjung) or what not and usually my eyes just gloss over these words, but I'm realizing I don't really have any real sense of what rang jung actually means. To my best understanding, would it be accurate to say that it connotes a sense of timelessness, of being beyond causality, beginningless/endless? If anyone could clarify the meaning of rangjung a little more, or point me towards any reading materials, provide examples/analogies/metaphors/etc. that would be really helpful. Thank you guys!!

The Melody of the Quick Path of the Vidyādharas: The Profound Aspiration of Traveling to the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain
E ma ho:
The natural objectless dharmadhatu is free from proliferation,
the clear appearances of the essence of pristine consciousness are naturally perfected,
transformations of the varied dramatic play of union:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

On the island of Lanka, the terrifying rakshasa land in the southwest, 
amidst many cities of flesh-eating rakshasas
is a very cold smooth lake rippled by waves:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

In the middle of that lake are male and female nāgas
adorned with beautiful ornaments, attractive, showing smiling faces, 
with hands gesturing with devotion, and billowing clouds of the wealth of nagas:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Water birds with beautiful plumage
swim happily, give throat to song, and look from the side.
Golden fish undulate and move quickly. The crocodiles are glossy and bright:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

There in the middle is a ruby mountain,
huge, high and great, radiating brilliant light rays everywhere. 
The base is the country of the nāgas, and the peak touches the realm of form:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

On its slopes dakinis perform a ganacakra at the four times, 
in the overhangs are fans of kusa grass and inside of small compounds
male and female siddha vidyādharas practice samadhi:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

The peak is a vast area, beyond all measure. 
The ground is made from the seven precious substances. 
The surface is even like the palm of the hand, brilliant with lights rays.
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Upon that is a self-originating celestial mansion 
showing the four activities with stacks of rock crystal, tiger’s eye, 
ruby and sapphire in the four directions:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Above it, a palace of pure white crystal
is the well built, exquisite Vijaya palace;
also above it is a beautiful coral celestial temple:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.
 
Three stories, with four corners, with an outer courtyard ornamented with checkered patterns, 
with jewel beams, cross pieces, and projections;
four doors in the four directions ornamented with pediments:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Filling the center is a 
vast three storied canopy beautified with
sapphire, silver, the finest gold and so on:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

The roof is adorned with a shining victorious jewel-emanated vajra finial 
and beautiful railings.
A variety of silk ribbons flutter:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Decorated with emanated hanging nets and half nets of
beautiful garlands of many types of gems,
small bells are rung by the fluttering hanging silk borders:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

When moved by a soft breeze small gold and silver bells, 
half-moons, vajras, and fly whisks festooned with gems, 
jingle with the pleasing sound of Dharma:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

The four porticos are adorned with a Dharma wheel, 
a five-colored umbrella and a male and female deer, 
ornamented with diamond lintels and lapis lazuli door locks:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Streamers of desirable things hang down to the foundation of the walls, 
an assembly of beautiful, lovely goddesses
dance blissfully, smile charmingly and sing songs:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Like the display of Bodhisattva Samantabhadra, 
billowing inconceivable clouds 
of inner, outer, secret and reality offerings:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Wish-fulfilling jewels appear outside everywhere,
the tiles of the three staged border
are beautified with nets of pearl bells:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Above that, the white crystal Bodhi Stupa
radiates white light and is adorned with garlands of blue lotuses
surrounded by one thousand and two beautiful statues:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Surrounding the celestial mansion is a rainbow pavilion. 
Eight great heroic dancers sing songs of power
dancing with bell-festooned bangles and the sound of drums:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Inside of the clouds of various excellent colors in the sky, 
are an assembly of beautiful sons and daughters of the gods,
well formed, adorned with ornaments, beautiful to be behold:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Umbrellas, victory banners, pennants, cymbals, 
vinas, flutes, lutes with melodious praise,
fragrant incense and washing water manifest in the form of musicians:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

In all directions throughout space without interruption
in the middle of the clouds of interwoven rainbows of five lights, 
a cool rain of flowers float, swirl and fall:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.
 
All scents of self-originated fragrant incense 
permeate that whole buddhafield, inside, outside and in between, 
just like sap before summer growth:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Luminous without any mention of “day” or “night”,
with a sun and moon which never set, 
arising without obstructions, everywhere is pervaded with light:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

A vajra fence, beautified with the seven precious substances, 
is decorated with many flowers by gods. 
One can never see it enough since it shines with its own radiance:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Bathing ponds, very pure and beautiful,
with rosaries of slow ripples shining with shimmering rainbow patterns,
adorned with golden swans, permeated with sweet scents:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

In meadows, medicine groves, and bunches of kumuda flowers
tiny bees of gold and turquoise hover and soar, collecting nectar. 
Many beautiful wild animals frolic:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

A wish-granting tree made out of jewels
has dancing limbs and perfect leaves,
adorned with hanging strands of peals, gold and turquoise:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

White, yellow, red and green emanated birds
fly beautifully and eat its fruit,
melodiously proclaiming the Dharma with sweet tones:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Between brilliant shining ruby cliffs
rivers of stainless amrita slowly flow,
peacefully spreading out on the jeweled delta:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

The wind that slowly moves sands of gold,
piles up dunes of various wish-fulfilling gems,
turquoise, coral, pearl, lapis lazuli, Zi and agate:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

On that peak of the mountain that starts in the rakshasa country
is five colored rainbow bridge of the fortune of liberation,
lined with welcoming dakinis who bear various offerings:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

In the center of the celestial palace
on a self-originated jeweled throne, in the middle of a lotus of one thousand petals,
are sun and moon discs, full like the moon of the fifteenth day:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

In the center of a pavilion of interlaced five colored rainbow lightrays
is Orgyen Chenpo Nangsid Zilnon,
the essence of the Sugatas of the three times:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain

His rainbow body, the vajra body, is the union of appearance and emptiness,
with a pinkish complexion, blazing with the major and minor marks,
with all signs and meaning perfect, adorned with silks and jewels:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

The unimpeded lion’s roar, possessing the sixty-limbed melodious voice of Brahma,
roars the sound of the Dharma, the essence of profound secret intimate instructions, 
the inexpressible unceasing nature:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

The great bliss that has always been pure is the vajra mind,
possessing omniscient pristine consciousness that knows clearly and without confusion
the unceasing phenomena of samsara and nirvana within the non-arisen vast expanse:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain

His compassionate activity is the supreme wish-fulfilling gem beyond example,
acting on behalf of any possible wish
of sentient beings pervading space:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

In his lap is his own luminosity, Samantabhadri Yeshe Tsogyal,
pinkish complexion, youthful,
delighting in intercourse with the mood of non-dual bliss:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Above and in the four directions on lotus, sun and moon seats
are the five emanated Thotrengtsals in union with their consorts,
in the colors of the directions, youthful and blazing brilliantly:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

In the front ranks are the vidyādharas of India and Tibet
overwhelming samsara and nirvana with non-conceptual experience,
show peaceful, increasing, power and fierce activities:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

In the ranks to the right are panditas and translators of India and Tibet
murmuring the melodious sounds of the Dharma of speech and text
of intimate instructions of sutra, tantra, and essence tantras:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

In the ranks on the left are emanated tertons,
maintaining ascetic conduct, roaring the fearless lion’s roar 
of ceaseless vajra sons:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Behind him, in the expanse of squares of five lights of pristine consciousness,
are stacked volumes of the sublime Dharma of the nine vehicles,
showing their cloth labels, resounding with the intrinsic sound of the vowels and consonants:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

On the periphery are wisdom dakinis
dancing dramatically in all sorts of beautiful ways, 
tiny bells jingling:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

On the inner veranda are the assembly of brother and sister protectors awaiting commands,
with fierce power and blazing like brilliant fire 
at play in an expanse of a seething triangular ocean of blood:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

On the outer veranda are the assembly of Kinkara and Lanka couples,
the ksetrapalas, the four swift messengers, the seven mothers, the four sisters, 
pisachis, shakinis, and female place guardians: 
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

On the second story, in the center of a pavilion of rainbow light
is Avalokiteshvara, the giver of compassion holding a lotus,
surrounded by his retinue, the play of self-appearing pristine consciousness:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

On the upper story, in a sphere of self-originated bliss,
is Samantabhadra Adinath Amitabha
demonstrating the symbolic Dharma to a retinue of rigpa’s own display:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

At the four doors are the four directional kings with their messengers. 
There is freedom from any causes for misfortune 
because they stand guard wrathfully:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

In brief, the qualities of that buddhafield are unimaginable.
The assembly of the three roots, buddhas and bodhisattvas
always gather there like dust in a sunbeam:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Internally, it is the buddhafield of the great bliss of Samantabhadra, 
the originally pure, naturally perfected dharmadhātu of the basis free from proliferation, 
a self-originated celestial mansion possessing the supreme of all aspects:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Light rays stream out everywhere without any direction or partiality,
beautified with wisdom ornaments of forms and bindus,
a limitless array spreading out lacking center or periphery:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

In the center of that is the vase body, one’s own self-originated rigpa,
Padmasambhava, who has never been the same nor different than the three kāyas,
surrounded by retinue of his own display appearing in every kind of way:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Having seen the face of the natural state of vidyā 
free from any external action or effort in the state of relaxation free from activity,
empowered on the great throne of the unmoving dharmadhātu:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

As such, the non-conceptual external buddhafield
is Sudarshana, a naturally perfected limitless array.
Through bringing sincere intense devotion to mind:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

When the time of death arrives 
May no harm or suffering occur
to myself and all father and mother sentient beings :
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Pushed from behind by red winds of karma,
escorted from the front by the servants of Yamarāja, 
when the breath stops and leaves this illusory body:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Without attachment to relatives, food, drink, or wealth,
tears streaming from my eyes, palms clasped together,
offering a melodious supplication over and over again:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Without fear of the deluded visions of the bardo,
may the compassion of the Vidyadhara of Orgyen, Padmasambahva,
shine forth from the natural buddhafield, Lotus Light:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

And at that very moment, from the direction of that buddhafield,
dancing blissful dakinis 
project a rainbow bridge:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Mother Tsogyal, heroes and assembly of dakinis,
come scattering flowers, dancing to the sound of harmonious music
holding cymbals, umbrellas, and banners:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain

From smiling mouths declaring “Undistracted child of a good familty,
now you are going to the Lotus Light Palace”,
physically taking one by the hand:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Surrounded by an assembly of heros and dakinis,
when leaving on the rainbow bridge,
having crossed it in a single instant like a trick of the eyes:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

When led before the father Guru,
through seeing his face with eyes of pure devotion,
the delighted bliss of a joyful mind arises:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

The eyes of his pleasantly smiling face are wide open,
in pleased manner he says,
“Child, you have come before me”, providing solace:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

Having emanated offerings, like the cloud of offerings emanated
by the bodhisattva Samantabhadra,
all of the assembly of gods of that land are pleased:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

The Vidyādharas are arranged in ranks, 
mixed inseparably with the mind of Padmsambhava,
having mastered the throne of the dharmadhātu, enjoying the stage of a vajra holder:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

The innate form of compassion from the empty dharmadhātu,
with the dance of the net of illusion that tames all,
his omniscience provides solace to all migrating beings at the same time:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain.

By the blessings of the Guru, the union of the three roots,
and the undeceiving truth of the real nature of phenomena,
and by the power of my sublime pure devotion:
May I be born in the Lotus Light Palace on the Glorious Copper Colored Mountain. 

This is the essence of the most profound.
When the time of death arrives,
if this is recited just once with intense faith and yearning,
without any doubt at all one will definitely be
born in the Lotus Light Palace;
what need to mention whether or not
those who recite this regularly will be reborn there?
Encouraged through the circumstances of the passing away of my nun, Tenzin Zangmo, I, Kunzang Dechen Lingpa recited these profound words of aspiration under a overhanging rock. May this be a cause for the liberation of all migrating beings from the ocean of samsara and [may they] be reborn in the Palace of Lotus Light.

There would be topics of discussion we could conscionably ignore, and we would neither prattle on about trivialities nor grow ego-maniacal about acquiring knowledge. Conflicts would not be avoided outright, but weighed up as either dignified or undignified. The elderly would be respected. What had been turned over would be made upright. What balance we could achieve between study, contemplation and meditation. From the island of Dharma would beam the lighthouse of dignity, guiding us through the tumultuous ocean of uncertainty.

However, the point is that the Buddha's path is not only about freedom from negative qualities. It is also about the attainment of positive qualities, such as the four fearlessness, the eighteen unshared qualities of a Buddha and so on.

So while it is true that the motive for the attainment of these positive qualities is in order to liberate other sentient beings, they are also positive in their own right, apart from that motivation.

Malcolm wrote:
From a Buddhist point of view, physical gender is unalterable (apart from the third week of pregnancy, where there are thing one can do to change the gender of a child). Whether you have a penis removed or attached, it has no bearing on your actual gender.

It is interesting to note that there was at one time a lot of pushback from women's festivals over the issue of transwomen. If anyone has seen the show Transparent on Amazon, there is treatment of this issue on that show, there is still some pushback, but in general, it seems that younger women are more accepting of transwomen than older women.

Still, there are key experiences, embodied experiences, that transwomen will never undergo such as developing breasts at puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, and so on. The same holds true for transmen.

Thus, while one may be able to change one's appearance, changing one's gender is impossible. Gender assignment is a function of karma, not surgery.

Despite this, I see no real reason to make such a big issue out of trans people using the bathroom of their choice.

I think I really misunderstood what was going on earlier in this thread, then. What did you mean when you said that Vajrayana describes the mind-essence differently?

Malcolm wrote:
It depends on which system we are discussing, Mahāmudra or Dzogchen.

In general, in Chan we do not find any descriptions of the mind essence one would not also find in the sūtras, such attributes as luminosity, etc., are all tp be found in the sūtra division. Also, there is the notion that buddhahood is to be found in the mind.

Mahāmudra, and here we are referring to Mahāmudra as it is practiced mainly the Karma Kagyu school, is divided up into three kinds, sūtra, "tantric" and essence. The first of these is based on a gradual system of pointing out done in conjunction with sessions of practice. The second of these is based on the experience of empowerment combined with yogic practices which rapidly induce samadhi, and the third of these systems is based on a kind of blessing empowerment and does not have any practice other than guru devotion. Of these three, the first is most like Chan, in that while it is gradual, it is also includes the idea of sudden awakening. In all, the practice is based on understand that mind as inseparable clarity and emptiness as the basis for the three kāyas. Clarity and luminosity are not the same thing (though the term gsal ba, clarity, can be used as a gloss for 'od gsal, luminosity"), the former term refers to mind's open lit-up space in which appearances rise and subside — some people like to translate clarity as "cognizance." In sūtra and Chan "luminosity" refers to the mind's essential purity.

In Dzogchen on the other hand, mind is strictly a product of a process of delusion. While the mind-essence is also inseparable clarity and emptiness, mind itself is the result of ignorance about its own state. Thus mind is always with concepts and is always deluded, mind-essence is always nonconceptual and undeluded.

The reason why the awakening of all three systems is the same is that all realize the same emptiness. But there are distinct differences in path and praxis based on how the mind-essence is understood and how the human body plays a role in awakening (Note, I did not say that buddhahood offered by all three systems is the same, just the awakening (there is one level of Buddhahood in Chan, three in Mahāmudra and six in Dzogchen.) In Chan, apart from posture, there is basically no role for the human body in terms of awakening. This also true in Sūtra Mahāmudra, where the practice based on a gradual approach to śamatha and vipaśyāna, combined with oral instructions from the siddhas.

In Dzogchen, the practice is based on the human body from beginning to end, like other Vajrayāna systems. While there are many differences between Dzogchen and other Vajrayāna systems, one of the most salient is Dzogchen is not a path of renunciation, nor is it a path of transformation. It is a path of self-liberation. How that self-liberation is understood is a direct consequence of how it deals with the issue of mind essence.

Chan is Sūtra because it is not Vajrayāna, plain and simple. It has no method of empowerment, no method of direct introduction, no practice based on the anatomy of the human body, etc.

There are no methods in Chan not taught in sūtras. Chan is basically prajñāpāramitā in theory and approach, using the sudden approach taught in the Lankāvatara Sūtra. This is why I call Chan sūtra-based, not because there is some sūtra that Chan follows.

But its ok, you asked a question, I endeavored to answer it. It is pretty clear to me when I talk to Zen folks that their practice is very different than what we do. I also have a student who practiced for 35 years under Maizumi Roshi and his successors. She is pretty clear on how Zen, including koans, and Dzogchen, etc. are different.

According to who is that the Chan account of the nature of mind?

In the classical Chan texts I've read, no clear distinction is made between the mind and its nature. The mind is described as dynamic, miraculously aware, luminous, unborn, and blissful, and all changing appearances perceived are no different from the mind. It's not as simple saying that its nature is empty, I don't think.

Ok, well, you continue to believe what you like. You seem to have decided what is true and what is not. Since you have decided there is no difference between Chan, Dzogchen and Mahāmudra, there is no reason for you to pursue the latter two.

It's never called "direct introduction", but I think it would be a bit silly to think that what's going on in Tibetan ngo sprod is any different from what's going on in some of the gong-ans. The same words (well, in translation at least) are even used at times -- "just this". Does it really matter that Chan didn't reify this into a method?

Malcolm wrote:
Again, the difference is that in direct introduction you are introduced to the mind-essence immediately, it is not something you need to go out and discover on your own or search for.

In Chan, there is no discussion of direct introduction, or even hint of it, because Chan is a path which is not based on Secret Mantra. So the approach is completely different.

I suspect we might be talking about different kinds of experience. Huangbo talks extensively about how the Buddha and the Patriarchs pointed out the nature of mind. He also says that "if one recognizes one's own Mind and sees one's own Nature, there is nothing at all to seek outside oneself". The nature of mind can clearly also be talked about as something experienced. So it's not as simple as I formulated it.

The concept of "nature" (xing 性) has a history in China pre-dating Buddhism. See a short section on nature here, or for instance the opposing views of Mengzi and Xunzi. Besides that, the concept also comes from India in the form of the tathagatagarbha teachings. So, it is fairly complicated why and how certain terms are used.
It just throws me for a loop when the nature of mind is so frequently discussed as if it's a thing that can be cognized, even if such a view is explicitly shot down. If it's not adding anything on, then why add it on?

I was contemplating some obstacles I've identified in my practice - without going into detail, they are deep seated beliefs that restrain me from wholeheartedly exploring certain avenues. They manifest with a feeling of fear of doing wrong. In the course of considering my limitations, it got me thinking of similar obstacles faced by others - for instance, for many Westerners, a belief in God instilled from an early age presents obstacles to Buddhist understanding. Whatever the particular nature of these sorts of obstacles, they impress me as hindrances to the sort of relinquishment necessary to advance on the path.

The train of thought next got me thinking of the general decline in religious affiliation and the growth of atheism in the developed world. It reminded me of the parable of the doctor who proscribes and then later prescribes milk in the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra.

The parable in short: There is a royal doctor who indiscriminately prescribed milk as a cure for all ills. One day the king falls ill but the milk prescribed only makes him worse. Another doctor comes along, declares that milk is the wrong cure, cures the king with other medicine. The king rewards the new doctor by making him the royal doctor. The new royal doctor proscribes milk as a cure for any disease throughout the kingdom, and after a time, the entire kingdom comes to see milk more or less as a pathogen. The king falls ill again and after examining him, the new royal doctor prescribes milk as a cure. The king is apprehensive as the new royal doctor had taught for years that milk was a pathogen. The king takes the milk and is cured. The new royal doctor explains that the previous doctor did not understand illness or milk and indiscriminately prescribed milk which might have cure some illnesses, but also made people sick. The nature of illness and the nature of milk must be understood, and when it is understood, milk can be an appropriate cure.

I wonder if the decline in religious affiliation and growth in atheism is a sort of rejection of milk?

In both Tibetan and East Asian Buddhism there is an idea that in a time marked by overall decline in standards of ethics, morality, religion, etc. the real, most profound teachings of Buddhism will spread. I wonder if its the breakdown in the perpetuation of (false) views that permits people open to the most profound teaching to arise, free of the fetters that hold people of previous generations back?

Jeff,

What you say is fine, but it does not address the age in which we live nor the reason for Vajrayāna teachings.

Vajrayāna is a path of nonrenunciation, i.e., it is a path of transformation. While it is certainly true that one should eschew irresponsible and harmful sexual behavior, it is not the case that sexuality is, a priori, a "significant deterrent" to "overcoming the pervasive suffering of samsara."

Since this is the upaya section, it should be observed that Vajrayāna is the path of means. As such, there are many means in Vajrayāna to transform the three or five afflictions into the path of awakening. One needs to be open to this possibility if one is studying Lamrim.

Jeff H said:
I think most of this thread has been the personal opinions of individual Buddhists, which is certainly valid, but lacks apparent grounding in the traditional teachings. Personal opinions that do not account for the traditional teachings can be misleading, in my opinion. As this is posted in the upaya forum, I think a more skillful method is to gain an authoritative overview of the actual teachings first and then freely decide how to conduct ourselves.

Buddhism does not say we “shouldn’t have sex”. We are free to do whatever we want. Buddhism addresses the consequences. If you want to stop experiencing certain results, or if you want to attain a certain goal, Buddhism teaches us to recognize the normally hidden causes. Buddhism teaches what to abandon and what to adopt IF you want to go in a certain direction.

In the context of overcoming the pervasive suffering of samsara, sexuality is not an innocent pleasure; it is a significant deterrent. The teachings on sexual misconduct are intended to help mitigate the harmful results of our natural sexual tendencies, without undue repression, until such time as we can freely and willingly overcome it.

It is like the verse in the Foundation of All Good Qualities prayer (from the FPMT prayer book): Seeking samsaric pleasures is the door to all suffering:
They are uncertain and cannot be relied upon.
Recognizing these shortcomings,
Please bless me to generate the strong wish for the bliss of liberation.
Or the translation I prefer: Samsara’s pleasures are deceptive, give no contentment only torment;
So please bless me to strive sincerely to gain the bliss of perfect freedom.
Sexual bliss is not at all related to the bliss referred to here, except, perhaps, as a grossly imperfect simile.

No one said they leaped: the last hell being out of hell take rebirth in the preta realm; the last preta takes rebirth in the animal realm, and so on. This all takes an extraordinary amount of time from our limited 100 year (if we are lucky) perspective.

The reason why the upper form realms do not perish, as near as I can make out, it because they are the location of the pure abodes such as the Akaniṣṭha (not the same as Akaniṣṭha Ganavyuha) , āryas inhabit them. Relevant pages in the Kośabhasyaṃ vol.2, 475-477.

And yes, if we are indolent and like to suffering for a really long time, sure, we do not have to do anything much, and eventually we will be born in the upper form realm, hear teachings, attain liberation, and that will be that. Or we can save ourselves the trouble, hear teachings now, put them into practice and at worst achieve buddhahood in the bardo.

What about Padmasambhava appearing as the rakshasa king? According to you, rakshasas are just Madagascan headhunters which were recorded by the Indians as being monsters. Therefore, if ordinary beings can see the headhunters/rakshasas, then we should also find Padmasambhava there, in his monstrous and freakish nirmanakaya form with no problem, as we have the requisite karmic vision, just like the Indians of old, yes?

Malcolm wrote:
I think if you relinquish your attachment to your karmic vision, you will easily find Padmasambhava there, just as you will easily find Vimalamitra at Wu Tai Shan, along with many Chinese tourists.

We can understand from the account of the taming of Rudra, the Ramayāna and so on, that Indian shipping lanes were troubled by seagoing pirates related to the headhunters of Borneo, and in the case of Śrī Lanka, there was an out and out war between Indo-Aryans and the headhunting tribes living there.

What would happen to those beings in the next kalpa when those six realms reappear, is not clear.  Is their karmic slate pristine or do they begin at the bottom again, being bad or badder?

Malcolm wrote:
The way it works is like this, according to Abhidharma:

After the last sentient being leaves the hell realm, the hells disappear.
After the last sentient being leaves the preta realm, the preta realm disappears.
After the last sentient being leaves the animal realm, the animal realm disappears.
After the last sentient being leaves the human realm, the human realm disappears.
After the last sentient being leaves the lower deva realms, the deva realms disappear (including the asuras), with the exception of the two upper form realm heavens.

At this point, all sentient beings exist in the two upper form realms. Why?


After the last sentient being leaves the hell realm, the hells disappear because all karma to generate the hell realms has been purified in all sentient beings who are to be born there.
After the last sentient being leaves the preta realm, the preta realm disappear because...
After the last sentient being leaves the animal realm, the animal realm disappear because...
After the last sentient being leaves the human realm, the human realm disappear because...
After the last sentient being leaves the lower deva realms, the deva realms disappear, with the exception of the two upper form realm heavens, because all karma to generate the the lower deva realms has been purified in all sentient beings who are to be born there.

So every thing up to the Brahmalokas disappear because there are no more sentient beings with karma to be born there, since that karma has been exhausted, apart from subtle traces.

Those traces are however important, because according to the Abhidharma scheme, these traces are what causes the six lokas to gradually reappear, from the Brahmaloka on down to the hells, one realm at a time, from top to bottom as sentient beings gradually gather again the karma to be born in those realms.

The method behind Abhidharma, similarly, is not concerned with postulating theories based on statistical probabilities and verifying these through conducting experiments, resulting in "facts". There are no facts in Abhidharma. The Abhidharma takes the words of the Buddha as law / Dharma, and then through experience and inference, and through a process of much even handed debate, arrives at the most convincing extension of this understanding. If the Buddha never explicitly proclaimed the geometry of the earth, you can be sure it was not of any significance.

Malcolm wrote:
Abhidharma does not accept every word the Buddha said as literally true. For example, the debate with the Pudgalavadin's who introduce various statements of the Buddha which they take literally in order to prove there is an inexpressible pudgala which transmigrates.

Southern half of the island is better of, it has some of the original forests, but overall the whole country is in very poor state. One would expect that influence of Padmasambhava´s pure realm would influence the people to be more virtuous and take better care of their environment and lives.

You seem to have forgotten that each of the six realms vanishes when it is emptied of sentient beings, beginning with the hell realms. This is common also to Abhidharma. However, the two upper form realms never disappear, even though everything below them is destroyed by cataclysms of fire, air and water at the end of the eon. The main difference between this cosmological idea in Abhidharma and Dzogchen is that in the latter, it is held by Garab Dorje that all sentient beings attain buddhahood through the practice of Atiyoga. So here, the idea that there is no one devoid of the gotra, family of buddhahood.

Thurman accepts the traditional view, a pretty good scholar.  Also why would Vasubandhu comment on his brother's works if he thought Maitreya the Regent was not the guru of Asanga?  Also Thurman uses Maitreya-natha for the Regent, because 'nath' means something like Lord, which can be applied to the mahasattva.

This is also OT, so fare thee well, our contentious one.

Malcolm wrote:
Hi Nicholas,

It is not off topic, because you invoked the authority of this account in your defense of this position.

I don't accept this traditional Tibetan account because it is contradicted by Chinese sources, and because it does not appear until centuries after Asanga.

Now, is it possible that Asanga received these five texts in a vision. Perhaps, however, I don't believe this is so, because of the stylistic consistency of the five treatises, the great difference between them and Asanga's mode of writing, and because of a complete absence of confirmation about this from the Madhyamaka school. It is therefore my belief that Maitreyanātha was an Indian scholar who summarized the three main trends of Mahāyāna sūtras in five texts who lived before Asanga and after Nāgārjuna, and that is about as much as we actually know.

The tradition of Maitreya the Regent is supported by Mipham, Vasubandhu and many others - it is strong enough to satisfy me.

Malcolm wrote:
In fact, there is no place where Vasubandhu makes this identification.

This is a later tradition, post-Vasubandhu, making its first appearance in the works of Xuantsang, and in fact the Chinese tradition itself is all over the map. By the eight century however, the tradition is solidified in India (nearly five centuries after the dates generally assumed for the composition of the five treatises, i.e. late 3rd, early 4th century), and thus the Tibetan sources are univocal on this point.

The fact that Mipham reports a tradition that is demonstrably late and has no foundation in the core texts we are discussing themselves is of no weight whatsoever.

The fact is that no Madhyamaka authors until the Haribhadra make this identification, especially in light of Vimuktisena making no mention of it, and the fact that Vasubandhu's main student, Sthiramati, makes no mention of it either. The latter merely refers to Maitreya as "Ārya Maitreya," and while he indicates that the author of the Madhyantavibhanga is impeded by only a single birth, he offers no details on the transmission of the text to Asanga apart from noting that it was bestowed upon Asanga through the blessings of Maitreya.

As we move through the texts in time, we can see the story becoming more elaborated and fleshed out.

During the first of the three big kalpas bodhisattvas use female bodies if they wish, but after that time period (a mere 10 to the 59th power years) the use only male bodies.  So women can become great bodhisattvas, but not full Buddhas.

See Engle's new translation The Bodhisattva Path to Unsurpassed Enlightenment, pp 169-70.

Astus said:
The Astasahasrika says otherwise, attributing the freedom from female birth to much higher level bodhisattvas.

"Endowed with these attributes, tokens and signs a Bodhisattva should be borne in mind as irreversible from full enlightenment. Furthermore, an irreversible Bodhisattva does not pander to Shramanas and Brahmins of other schools, telling them that they know what is worth knowing, that they see what is worth seeing. He pays no homage to strange Gods, offers them no flowers, incenses, etc., does not put his trusts in them. He is no more reborn in the places of woe, nor does he ever again become a woman."
(PP 8000 17.1, tr Conze)

Nicholas Weeks said:
No PDF yet, so I have been too lazy (until now) to quote the full passage:
All buddhas are the same in every respect and free of differences, except for these four things:  life span, name, caste, and physical size.  The distinction among buddhas is due to a variation in these four qualities and not to anything else whatsoever.

A woman cannot attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment.  Why is that?

Once a bodhisattva has passed beyond the first [period of a] countless number of kalpas he abandons the state of being a woman, and [from then on] until he sits at the seat of enlightenment, he will never again become a woman.
The entirerty of womankind naturally possesses a great many mental afflictions and is subject to inferior wisdom, and it is not possible for [a person with] a mind stream that naturally possesses a great many mental afflictions and is subject to inferior wisdom to attain unsurpassed true and complete enlightenment.
The first short graph giving the only four distinctions among buddhas does not list sex.

As to what exactly Astus means by 'much higher level bodhisattvas', I do not know.  In any case both this sutra and Asanga agree that at some point the woman state is not used.  That does not mean that female buddhas or bodhisattvas do not appear.  At the 8th Ground the power to appear as any sort of being, even buddhas, is gained.

The main reason for bringing up this subject again is that I tired of seeing all the sociology supposedly ruling the buddhadharma.

"Irreverisble" refers to the 8th bhumi which requires two incalculable kalpas to reach. Being that the words from a sutra trump that of a sastra, Asanga is incorrect in this case if the translations are correct.

And as pointed out, at any rate beings do not realise buddhahood in a female body in sutrayana, and saying that they do is both extra-textual and contra-textual.

But these are just mental concepts upon which he focused, and he discovered that by focusing them they created paths for rebirth.

This is also why it is said that śamatha without vipaśyāna merely creates a cause for birth as a lower form realm deity, because it is conceptual.

thought creates partitions of manifestation into "me" "you" "the table" etc. these may or may not be useful, but since they are changeable, they cannot be fundamental. only the fact of manifestation is fundamental. That is why it is less clear to claim that the basis is a quality of "mind" as if mind were a self-existent entity: "mind" is a partition created by thought, just like "table".


Malcolm wrote:
There are no thoughts to create a partition if there is no mind.

And, since, as you say, when you discover your own state, you also discover the state of the "universe" (i.e. gcig shes kun grol), this reduces the so called "basis" to a set of generic qualities. This does not render a mind "self-existent."

For example, Āryadeva says that when you discover the emptiness of one thing, you discover the emptiness of all things. But this does not mean there is an emptiness "out there" which pervades everything, anymore than there is a basis "out there" which is the foundation for manifestation.

Malcolm wrote:
I did not say anything of the kind anywhere. I never made such a claim and neither do Dzogchen texts.

You seem to think there is some kind of basis, which you imagine to be transcendent (aka free from extremes), out of which there arises an appearance (how and to whom?); despite the obvious contradiction in such a position if your putative basis is just blank emptiness free from extremes (i.e. something which does not exist at all, conventionally or otherwise).

When the Dzogchen texts are talking about "the basis" in terms of essence, nature and compassion, they are talking about qualities of the nature of the mind, not some transcendent pleroma.

The model I have provided is mostly my take on the sutta teachings. As noted above, there is no Mahayana version of the eight stages model. As for Zen, dhyana goes together with wisdom, and they together refer to the essence (emptiness) and function (discernment) of the nature of mind.

Malcolm wrote:
The problem with your model is that each of the dhyānas represents a conceptual focus. That is why we can take rebirth in the corresponding realms when we focus on them. So for example, if we make intense meditation on "everything is emptiness" as a conceptual focus, this means we will take rebirth in that realm.

Buddha cruised through them, one at a time, and saw how the four noble truths related to each abode, and eradicated that potential for rebirth.

Malcolm wrote:
Take it up with the Goddess of the Ganges, I suspect she has a thing or two to say about this:

Thereupon, a certain goddess who lived in that house, having heard this teaching of the Dharma of the great heroic bodhisattvas, and being delighted, pleased, and overjoyed, manifested herself in a material body and showered the great spiritual heroes, the bodhisattvas, and the great disciples with heavenly flowers. When the flowers fell on the bodies of the bodhisattvas, they fell off on the floor, but when they fell on the bodies of the great disciples, they stuck to them and did not fall. The great disciples shook the flowers and even tried to use their magical powers, but still the flowers would not shake off. Then, the goddess said to the venerable Sariputra, "Reverend Sariputra, why do you shake these flowers?"

Sariputra replied, "Goddess, these flowers are not proper for religious persons and so we are trying to shake them off."

The goddess said, "Do not say that, reverend Sariputra. Why? These flowers are proper indeed! Why? Such flowers have neither constructual thought nor discrimination. But the elder Sariputra has both constructual thought and discrimination.

"Reverend Sariputra, impropriety for one who has renounced the world for the discipline of the rightly taught Dharma consists of constructual thought and discrimination, yet the elders are full of such thoughts. One who is without such thoughts is always proper.

"Reverend Sariputra, see how these flowers do not stick to the bodies of these great spiritual heroes, the bodhisattvas! This is because they have eliminated constructual thoughts and discriminations.

"For example, evil spirits have power over fearful men but cannot disturb the fearless. Likewise, those intimidated by fear of the world are in the power of forms, sounds, smells, tastes, and textures, which do not disturb those who are free from fear of the passions inherent in the constructive world. Thus, these flowers stick to the bodies of those who have not eliminated their instincts for the passions and do not stick to the bodies of those who have eliminated their instincts. Therefore, the flowers do not stick to the bodies of these bodhisattvas, who have abandoned all instincts."

Then the venerable Sariputra said to the goddess, "Goddess, how long have you been in this house?"

The goddess replied, "I have been here as long as the elder has been in liberation."

Sariputra said, "Then, have you been in this house for quite some time?"

The goddess said, "Has the elder been in liberation for quite some time?"

At that, the elder Sariputra fell silent.

The goddess continued, "Elder, you are 'foremost of the wise!' Why do you not speak? Now, when it is your turn, you do not answer the question."

Sariputra: Since liberation is inexpressible, goddess, I do not know what to say.

Goddess: All the syllables pronounced by the elder have the nature of liberation. Why? Liberation is neither internal nor external, nor can it be apprehended apart from them. Likewise, syllables are neither internal nor external, nor can they be apprehended anywhere else. Therefore, reverend Sariputra, do not point to liberation by abandoning speech! Why? The holy liberation is the equality of all things!

Sariputra: Goddess, is not liberation the freedom from desire, hatred, and folly?

Goddess: "Liberation is freedom from desire, hatred, and folly" that is the teaching of the excessively proud. But those free of pride are taught that the very nature of desire, hatred, and folly is itself liberation.

Sariputra: Excellent! Excellent, goddess! Pray, what have you attained, what have you realized, that you have such eloquence?

Goddess: I have attained nothing, reverend Sariputra. I have no realization. Therefore I have such eloquence. Whoever thinks, "I have attained! I have realized!" is overly proud in the discipline of the well-taught Dharma.

Sariputra: Goddess, do you belong to the disciple-vehicle, to the solitary-vehicle, or to the great vehicle?

Goddess: I belong to the disciple-vehicle when I teach it to those who need it. I belong to the solitary-vehicle when I teach the twelve links of dependent origination to those who need them. And, since I never abandon the great compassion, I belong to the great vehicle, as all need that teaching to attain ultimate liberation.

Nevertheless, reverend Sariputra, just as one cannot smell the castor plant in a magnolia wood, but only the magnolia flowers, so, reverend Sariputra, living in this house, which is redolent with the perfume of the virtues of the Buddha-qualities, one does not smell the perfume of the disciples and the solitary sages. Reverend Sariputra, the Sakras, the Brahmas, the Lokapalas, the devas, nagas, yaksas, gandharvas, asuras, garudas, kimnaras, and mahoragas who live in this house hear the Dharma from the mouth of this holy man and, enticed by the perfume of the virtues of the Buddha-qualities, proceed to conceive the spirit of enlightenment.

Reverend Sariputra, I have been in this house for twelve years, and I have heard no discourses concerning the disciples and solitary sages but have heard only those concerning the great love, the great compassion, and the inconceivable qualities of the Buddha.

Reverend Sariputra, eight strange and wonderful things manifest themselves constantly in this house. What are these eight?

A light of golden hue shines here constantly, so bright that it is hard to distinguish day and night; and neither the moon nor the sun shines here distinctly. That is the first wonder of this house.

Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, whoever enters this house is no longer troubled by his passions from the moment he is within. That is the second strange and wonderful thing.

Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, this house is never forsaken by Sakra, Brahma, the Lokapalas, and the bodhisattvas from all the other buddha-fields. That is the third strange and wonderful thing.

Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, this house is never empty of the sounds of the Dharma, the discourse on the six transcendences, and the discourses of the irreversible wheel of the Dharma. That is the fourth strange and wonderful thing.

Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, in this house one always hears the rhythms, songs, and music of gods and men, and from this music constantly resounds the sound of the infinite Dharma of the Buddha. That is the fifth strange and wonderful thing.

Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, in this house there are always four inexhaustible treasures, replete with all kinds of jewels, which never decrease, although all the poor and wretched may partake to their satisfaction. That is the sixth strange and wonderful thing.

Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, at the wish of this good man, to this house come the innumerable Tathagatas of the ten directions, such as the Tathagatas Sakyamuni, Amitabha, Aksobhya, Ratnasri, Ratnarcis, Ratnacandra, Ratnavyuha, Dusprasaha, Sarvarthasiddha, Ratnabahula, Simhakirti, Simhasvara, and so forth; and when they come they teach the door of Dharma called the "Secrets of the Tathagatas" and then depart. That is the seventh strange and wonderful thing.

Furthermore, reverend Sariputra, all the splendors of the abodes of the gods and all the splendors of the fields of the Buddhas shine forth in this house. That is the eighth strange and wonderful thing.

Reverend Sariputra, these eight strange and wonderful things are seen in this house. Who then, seeing such inconceivable things, would believe the teaching of the disciples?

Sariputra: Goddess, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?

Goddess: Although I have sought my "female state" for these twelve years, I have not yet found it. Reverend Sariputra, if a magician were to incarnate a woman by magic, would you ask her, "What prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?"

Sariputra: No! Such a woman would not really exist, so what would there be to transform?

Goddess: Just so, reverend Sariputra, all things do not really exist. Now, would you think, "What prevents one whose nature is that of a magical incarnation from transforming herself out of her female state?"

Thereupon, the goddess employed her magical power to cause the elder Sariputra to appear in her form and to cause herself to appear in his form. Then the goddess, transformed into Sariputra, said to Sariputra, transformed into a goddess, "Reverend Sariputra, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?"

And Sariputra, transformed into the goddess, replied, "I no longer appear in the form of a male! My body has changed into the body of a woman! I do not know what to transform!"

The goddess continued, "If the elder could again change out of the female state, then all women could also change out of their female states. All women appear in the form of women in just the same way

as the elder appears in the form of a woman. While they are not women in reality, they appear in the form of women. With this in mind, the Buddha said, 'In all things, there is neither male nor female.'"

Then, the goddess released her magical power and each returned to his ordinary form. She then said to him, "Reverend Sariputra, what have you done with your female form?"

Sariputra: I neither made it nor did I change it.

Goddess: Just so, all things are neither made nor changed, and that they are not made and not changed, that is the teaching of the Buddha.

Sariputra: Goddess, where will you be born when you transmigrate after death?

Goddess: I will be born where all the magical incarnations of the Tathagata are born.

Sariputra: But the emanated incarnations of the Tathagata do not transmigrate nor are they born.

Goddess: All things and living beings are just the same; they do not transmigrate nor are they born!

Sariputra: Goddess, how soon will you attain the perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood?

Goddess: At such time as you, elder, become endowed once more with the qualities of an ordinary individual, then will I attain the perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood.

Sariputra: Goddess, it is impossible that I should become endowed once more with the qualities of an ordinary individual.

Goddess: Just so, reverend Sariputra, it is impossible that I should attain the perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood! Why? Because perfect enlightenment stands upon the impossible. Because it is impossible, no one attains the perfect enlightenment of Buddhahood.

Sariputra: But the Tathagata has declared: "The Tathagatas, who are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, have attained perfect Buddhahood, are attaining perfect Buddhahood, and will go on attaining perfect Buddhahood."

Goddess: Reverend Sariputra, the expression, "the Buddhas of the past, present and future," is a conventional expression made up of a certain number of syllables. The Buddhas are neither past, nor present, nor future. Their enlightenment transcends the three times! But tell me, elder, have you attained sainthood?

Sariputra: It is attained, because there is no attainment.

Goddess: Just so, there is perfect enlightenment because there is no attainment of perfect enlightenment.

We do not say the basis only has an conscious aspect, it also has an emptiness aspect. That is one of the qualities of the basis.

By pointing that the basis is a generic set of qualities, Dzogchen is stating that the basis is one's own consciousness, out of which one's afflictive reality is constructed by ignorance (ma rig pa), and deconstructed by knowledge (rig pa).

If you claim, as you are doing, that the basis is some kind of ineffable ground of being, this is contradicts not only the teaching of Dzogchen, but the teaching of the Buddha in toto. (and yes, peanut gallery, I am aware that there are some translators of Dzogchen texts who have taken the ill-advised route of importing terms from Christian theology into their translations, endlessly confusing students who read such texts and leading them far away from the teachings of Dzogchen in the process).

Arya Asanga, a Third Ground bodhisattva, says in his Bodhisattvabhumi that women cannot reach annutarasamyaksambodhi.  Because they have too many mental afflictions and inferior wisdom.

During the first of the three big kalpas bodhisattvas use female bodies if they wish, but after that time period (a mere 10 to the 59th power years) the use only male bodies.  So women can become great bodhisattvas, but not full Buddhas.

Well, in order to be free of knowledge obscurations, he would have to be a buddha, actually. Anyway, we do not really know that Asanga was a bodhisattva on the stages, apart from someone's claim that it is so.

I think may a visit to Vimalakirti's house might be in order for Asanga. I think Yeshe Tsogyal and Mandarava might have a thing or two to say about women's wisdom being "inferior."

are you saying the basis has consciousness or the basis is consciousness? If the basis has consciousness, you have reified it. If you say it simply is consciousness, then you are a cittamatrin.

Malcolm wrote:
You decide. The texts state pretty clearly that the basis has a conscious aspect (and in other places that it is an unfabricated consciousness), which we normally term both lhun grub and thugs rje, depending which level we are discussing. Both are considered the basis for delusion. Ka dag, on the other hand, since it never partakes in appearance, can never be a basis for delusion.

The reason that it is said that the basis has a conscious (shes pa) aspect is to provide an explanation of how there is rig pa and ma rig pa, and how ma rig pa then generates dualistic consciousness (rnam shes), and so on.

If you wish to consider the primary teaching of Dzogchen to be reifying the basis, that is ok with me. Whatever Dzogchen you are then following is not the Dzogchen of the sgra thal gyur and so on.

I think this got mixed up because of terminology. I only used the word consciousness to compare it to the 18 dhatu scheme, to show that experiences precedes subject and object. On the other hand, I debate an independent consciousness, because that is an absolutist version of subject, while even the subject itself is an abstraction from experience.

I consider production and nonproduction to be mutually exclusive. There is one or the other. There cannot be both. For example, in the illusion of elephant an elephant is never produced.

When it is understood that the illusion of an elephant is not an elephant, there is no concept of elephant to eliminate. One knows an elephant never existed where one seemed previously to appear.

Not necessarily. As I read the suttas, change from one jhana to another happens by recognition that the present mental factors are troubling. Then either one realises the true nature of appearances and abandons it all (i.e. nirvana) completely, or goes to the next level. It seems logical to me that unless there is a level of awareness, such a shift from one jhana to another could not happen. So, there is indeed correct samadhi and incorrect samadhi.

Malcolm wrote:
Shifts between dhyānas cannot deliberately happen after the second dhyāna. There can only be a deliberate shift through the remaining dhyānas by exiting one and then entering another. Because of the absence of vitarka in the second dhyāna on up, we then have the notion of so called "access concentrations."

He mentions development of jhanas to some extent, like in Detachment Within Activity on p 298-299.

In The Path in Harmony on p 316 he talks about the dangers of deep samadhi and that one should just go with access concentration. Then on the next page:

"So, there can be right samadhi and wrong samadhi. Wrong samadhi is where the mind enters calm and there’s no awareness at all. One could sit for two hours or even all day but the mind doesn’t know where it’s been or what’s happened. It doesn’t know anything. There is calm, but that’s all. It’s like a well-sharpened knife which we don’t bother to put to any use. This is a deluded type of calm, because there is not much self-awareness. The meditator may think he has reached the ultimate already, so he doesn’t bother to look for anything else. Samadhi can be an enemy at this level. Wisdom can not arise because there is no awareness of right and wrong.
With right samadhi, no matter what level of calm is reached, there is awareness. There is full mindfulness and clear comprehension. This is the samadhi which can give rise to wisdom, one can not get lost in it. Practitioners should understand this well. You can’t do without this awareness, it must be present from beginning to end. This kind of samadhi has no danger."

Thanks to all for your patience. At least now I can see the nut we are trying to crack.

First Problem

If there is an unconditioned mind, then it is beginningless, causeless.

If it's beginningless. it exists now.

If my mind is not pristine, its current state is conditioned, caused.

Therefore two minds exist and I am schizophrenic or something.

Malcolm wrote:
Time is not something real, therefore, this qualm does not apply [conditioned entities can only exist in time].


catmoon said:
Second Problem

Prior to enlightenment the Buddha's mind was not pristine.

After enlightenment it presumably was pristine.

Since this pristine mind could not have arisen without the prior existence of the conditioned mind...
The pristine mind is conditioned. If the pristine mind did not arise, but is present from beginningless time, we're back to problem 1.

I'm not trying to put these ideas forward as truth. I'm just trying to state the problems clearly.

All over the world, there are differences between the accounts of the after death visions. For example, christians may see Jesus; tibetans and some buddhists cultures will see wrathful gods or beautiful bodhisattvas.


If, as some lamas/Tibetan book of deads/ say, in the bardo we see the wrathful and benevolent deitys, why do westerners dont see them? I mean, if the bardo of death was really like the Tibetan Book of Dead describes, everybody would experience - among other things - that stuff related to deitys. But we dont see that on westerner descriptions of after life experiences.

Malcolm wrote:
This is because they have not received the empowerment of the peaceful and wrathful deities, and have not done this practice, so when they experience the sounds, lights and rays of the bardo of dharmatā, they just experience it as a confusing kaleidoscopic cacophony.

Astus said:
It doesn't arise from anything, since it's not something to arise or disappear, so in that sense it is unconditioned.

Malcolm wrote:
Right, I completely disagree with this. This is not how these things are explained in Dzogchen exegesis, nor how they are to be understood.

The nidāna or gleng gzhi is a major topic of importance in understanding Dzogchen tantras.

As Shenphen Ozer writes in the beginning of the commentary on this text:
In that respect, not saying "[Thus have I] heard [at one time]" is a superiority over the common vehicles in which the teacher and the retinue appear as separate. Here, the powerful scholar vidyādharas of the past have said this [Thus did I explain at one time] is a phrase which shows the teacher and retinue to be inseparable.
There is even a citation from the Kun byed rgyal po itself which contradicts your assertion:
I have always been Kulyarāja. 
Having made the teacher, the teaching, the retinue and the time, 
the teacher of the teachers is also made by me. 
The teaching is the explanation of my nature. 
After the retinue is the arising of my essence,
the time and place are my nature.
That tantra is the Kulayarāja which explains my nature, 
aside from which there is not even a single Dharma that is explained which is not mine.
Vimalamitra expands upon this further:
The perfection of place is dharmatā free from proliferation, not established through any characteristic and not established within the experiential range of words and syllables. Since the teacher (the mode of the existence of things) does not exist even as a word upon which proliferation is based, he is not established in terms of faces and hands because he is not established as a nominal proliferation. The perfect retinue for such a teacher is the self-originated [rang byung], self-arisen [rang shar] display of dharmatā. The perfect teaching for such a retinue is one’s own vidyā, the ultimate teaching — though it originates, it is self-originated; though it arises, it is self-arisen without being created by any cause or condition; and it is free from arising and perishing. Though it is present pervading all, its characteristic cannot be understood by anyone. As such, since place, teacher, retinue and the Dharma to be explained meet in the natural reality of things, the perfect time is called “without beginning or end.”
The setting for this tantra is beyond time, and both the teacher and retinue are also beyond time.

Sattvavajra is not someone who does not understand. Satvavajra, the retinue of vidyā, is the emanation of the dharmakāya Kulyarāja. This tantra only has an uncommon nidāna or introduction. It has no common nidāna. I.e, it has "This at one time did I explain" and no "Thus at one time did I hear." This means that the teacher and the retinue are the same continuum.

The three prajñās are the basis of all Buddhist paths: hearing, reflection and meditation. But of course the text says:
Since the transcendent state of I, Kulyarāja,
is beyond objects of reflection, it cannot be meditated.
Of course this is the case. It must be experienced.

But of course, in the commentary on chapter 78 , Shenphen Ozer cites Padmasambhava:
Though the view is higher than the sky, 
the cause and result of karma is finer than flour.

The simpler way to put it is that one cannot attain rainbow body by working with karmically solidified vision which arises from traces. One needs to work with so called "appearances of primordial wisdom (pristine consciousness)."

All appearances initially arise from the (unrecognized) potentiality ( rtsal ) of compassion ( thugs rjes ) because this corresponds with what ordinary sentient beings are able to see (i.e., the nirmanakāya), and this is why thugs rje corresponds with the nirmanakāya.

In other words, we are only able to perceive a portion of the basis, with which we are not integrated due to our ignorance. The path allows us to remove that ignorance.

This is definitely a point of contention. In general, in sūtra, it is considered that on the path of seeing all ordinary appearances vanish, one does not perceive them anymore. It is only in post-equipoise that appearances, albeit, now truly dream-like and illusory, return.
If by "ordinary appearances" it is meant as perceiving with delusion, then it is OK. If what is meant is total cessation of perception, then it is more like nirodha-samapatti.

Throughout the entire text.But you will need to be properly introduced to details via oral and symbolic transmission  about what it all means to say that we are the body of light already and how it can be  manifested.

Malcolm wrote:
That is the point, florin, the Kun byed rgyal po does not actually contain instructions about the path of realizing rainbow body. That is what man ngag sde is for, i.e., how to manifest the result which we have not realized (the basis a.k.a "primordial state").

For example, the commentary on the kun byed rgyal po contains myriad citations from the man ngag sde tantras in order to flesh out the meaning which is not explicitly discussed in the kun byed rgyal po itself. However, when one has received instructions on man ngag sde, then it is relative easy to to see how various things stated in the kun byed rgyal po imply thögal.

But there is no way that one can attain the complete result of Dzogchen teachings based on sems sde alone. If you don't believe me, read Longchenpa. And if you don't believe him, let me remind you that according to ChNN, there is no Tibetan who is more authoritative on explaining the meaning of Dzogchen that Longchenpa.

That has almost zero to do with how America conducts itself globally as an entity, in terms of projecting power, in terms of what it does and does not support in other nations etc. If anything generally our government has a pretty poor track record of supporting these supposed "values", except when they serve financial interests.

We can very well understand nonconceptual experiences, actually that's what we normally do all the time, conjecturing about sights and sounds, all sorts meditative experiences, and practically anything.

The emptiness of emptiness is dropping the conceptual grasping of the idea of emptiness, so it does have something there. Same goes for the unconditioned. Perception of emptiness is not perceiving anything (i.e. it's only nominally a type of perception), it is just normal perception without the imputation of substance.

Malcolm wrote:

Sems sde, within the Dzogchen literature itself, is mainly treated as the completion stage of mahāyoga, and in fact is really more or less the same thing as trekchö.

And the three words themselves are from the sgra thal gyur, originally.

Basically, there is this idea that the five bodhicitta texts translated by Vairocana, the four lungs and Mañjuśrīmitra's Meditation of Bodhicitta, somehow represent the real authentic or original Dzogchen. Well if they do, everybody grab a māla:
Further, because the teacher has declared that awakening can be correctly grasped with a symbol,
in that case, this is the basis of the meditation that generates awakened mind. 
After the three samadhis are stable, and after binding three symbolic mudras, 
generate the mind as the great dharmamudra and meditate the recitation of the essence [mantra].
Because most of us are not realizing the meaning of Dzogchen with the so-called direct method, so indirect methods are called for. Similar encouragements to use tantric methods can be found in the Dorsem Namkhaiche, which are supposedly the first words that Garab Dorje taught.

The bodhicitta texts concern the basis and direct introduction, but they lack any method to attain rainbow body.

It is a given in Dzogchen that our basis or primordial state is essence, nature and compassion. The actual state of the five elements, for example, is the five pristine consciousness, and this is why rainbow body is possible. But we do not manifest rainbow body in the present because of our ignorance, the trio of ignorances which we are subject to after we did not recognize the display of the basis as our own state, once upon a time.

There is not a single idea in the bodhicitta texts such as Kun byed rgyal po and so on that is not present in the man ngag sde. Actually, the reverse is the case. There are many things in man ngag sde which you will never find in the bodhicitta texts.

The store-consciousness' function is to maintain the seeds, where the seeds and the store-consciousness depend on each other, forming a stream. So, the store-consciousness is aware of the seeds (plus the "material" (not the 5 sense-consciousnesses) world). It includes and maintains all that one is not actually aware of, but it is explained as if there were a consciousness that knows of innumerable things, just like the ordinary ideas about the subconscious and memory where so many things are hidden. However - and this is where the problem is - none of us are actually conscious of anything that the store-consciousness supposedly knows. And, as you have noted before, the eight are simply functions of one consciousness, and it is unreasonable to say that one cannot know what one actually knows, there cannot be such a store-consciousness.

The reason you say it is immune, is because it cannot be conceived. What cannot be conceived cannot have a meaning, because meaning comes from conceiving what something is. Therefore, it is immune, because it is meaningless. On the other hand, if it is meaningful, then there is something to be conceived, and it is within the boundaries of conceptual analysis, hence not immune.

How can you separate something from its essence? Also, what is not the essence, the attributes? Is it the mind that discerns its own essence?

Malcolm wrote:
In the same way you can separate a grain from its husk. A conceptual mind will never perceive its own essence, because it focuses outward. But when, through either samadhi or introduction, the conceptual stream of the mind is interrupted, the nature of the mind shines out, like the sun shining through clouds, and is unmistakable.


Astus said:
Therefore, the original mind is dharmatā emptiness which is the luminous mind that does not become solely empty by nature or an inert emptiness and is called self-originated wisdom. Since there isn’t an iota of a characteristic of conditioned or unconditioned apart from being intrinsically clear emptiness, it is beyond the inert composed of particles, clarity which possesses subject and object, and a knowing consciousness.
Emptiness is always emptiness of something, just as awareness is awareness of something. Saying that appearances are always experienced (awareness, consciousness, mind) and also without essence (empty, not self, ungraspable), is perfectly fine with me. And an empty knowing as an abstract concept is also good, as long as it's not turned into some transcendental soul.

I think there are two possible reasons that rarely anyone puts up an extreme claim as you seem to do. Antinomianism is feared to be misused as licensed evil, or one wants a more coherent system that includes the stages of the path. Probably the two goes together.

Illusions are causes and conditions. It makes little difference to call pain and joy illusory as long as one is bound by them. And when not bound, it doesn't matter whether one calls them illusory or not either.

Malcolm wrote:
Astus, the etymology of the word "Illusion" is maya, maya means "deception" and "false." Appearances are either false or not. They cannot be a little false, just as one cannot be a little pregnant.

Rongzom states:
If is asked, "Do characteristics exist or not in appearances?,” if characteristics are held to exist, how will the system of the Great Perfection be the culmination of comprehending “like an illusion?” In that case, the higher and lower views are merely differentiate between more and less attachment to reality in appearances. 

For example, for the reflection of a black snake in the water; some will see a snake, [48/a] and will leave due to their fear. Likewise, even though phenomena which are a source of suffering are like an illusion, they are abandoned by the hearers who perceive them as real.

Even though some understand the black snake to be a reflection, thinking it will be harmful if touched, even so they depend on medicine. Likewise, even though in the system of the perfection of wisdom the relative is like an illusion. However since there is a view in which functional agents exist, one develops pristine consciousness concerning the objects of knowledge and relies upon the medicine of great compassion. [This is the perspective from which you are making your arguments, Astus]

Since some understand the black snake is a reflection. Even though it touched, no harm is perceived. They able to communicate to those with anxiety that its touch has no power. Likewise, in the systems of action and outer yoga tantra, even though it is comprehended there is no fault in lower conduct and substances, they do not have the capacity for intrepid behavior. But they have the capacity for the behavior of making offerings to deities, perform strict discipline, accomplishment substances, etc. 

Some understand there is no fault in touching a black snake even if touching it has the ability to harm, because that anxiety is rapidly removed, for which reason the strict discipline of the conduct of subjugation exists.[49/a]  Likewise, the system of inner yoga stands on the neck of practice to quickly render all phenomena homogenous. One’s behavior specifically corresponds to the strict discipline of the absence of virtue and misdeed in phenomena and the lack of no purity or impurity in food choices. 

Since some, possessing an undeceived mind regarding the characteristic of a reflection of a black snake, see all of those behaviors as the behavior of children. Thus, leaving aside the others, abandoning existents, etc.;, even the heroic subjugation of that reflection of a black snake is seen as a childish thought.  Accepting, rejecting or a mind fabricating the condition of those cannot develop, and moving and seeking do not occur. Likewise, since the system of the Great Perfection comprehends and is the culmination of the comprehension of all phenomena as totally equivalent to illusions, in that case, the mind is not confused by the power of appearances and there is no ability to develop formations— not accepting, not rejecting, not moving, and not seeking. As such, this culmination of the comprehension of being like an illusion is also proven to be the culmination of comprehending the two truths as inseparable.

The Buddhist teaching that the mind is by nature radiant is a very wholesome notion in working with suffering. It means that suffering is mind-made situation, a misperception of true reality, that clouds out the natural radiance, plunging one into greater darkness of delusion and pain. When the mind is attended to directly with mindfulness, one touches the natural radiance, and when one clears away the mental hindrances and other defilements, the mind shine radiantly again.
This not only a dhyānic radiance.

As the sutta itself says, consciousness ceases. Adding in brackets "activity of" means little, since a non-active consciousness is just unconsciousness. See more: Nibbana is not viññāṇa. Really, it just isn’t.. More analysis on the unestablished consciousness: Viññāṇa (Consciousness).

See my previous comment. Although it can be said that since there is no attachment, it doesn't rely on anything, doesn't identify with anything, so in a way it is as you say. My problem is that when it is said there is an "unconditioned consciousness", because consciousness means knowing and thinking, and there can be no knowing and thinking without causes and conditions, it is a contradiction.

Malcolm wrote:
It is a contradiction only if one has stubborn clinging things as real. But we already know that causes and conditions are completely unreal, so why get stuck on a consciousness being unconditioned?

That's a valid question. The difference here is that while normally it is easy to identify the first six consciousnesses, and that's what one works with, the 7th and 8th are not seen nor used for anything, except for theorising about karma.

The delusion in conventional is to take it for the absolute. When conventional is seen as conventional, there is no problem, so it is then the absolute. In other words, conventional is not negated but enlightened. But, again, we can say that there is either deluded functions and buddha functions, and the two never meet. However, I consider that model more misleading.

Malcolm wrote:

Further, the Kāśyapa-parivarta Sūtra states:
"Permanent," that is one extreme;"impermanent," that is another extreme. Whatever is the middle of those two cannot be investigated.
Sthiramati's comment on how this is understood is instructive:
If it is asked what is an extreme, the extreme of the tirthikas is grasping at a self. That is grasped as permanent, reifying the aggregates, sense bases and elements..."'Permanent,' that is the first extreme..." means "self, that is the first extreme." 

The śravakas and pratyekabuddhas grasp the aggregates and so on as impermanent and grasp them as selfless..."'Impermanent,' that is the second extreme..." means "selfless, that is the second extreme." 

"Whatever is the middle of those two, that is..." means that is nonconceptual pristine consciousness. Because that cannot be analyzed, it cannot be investigated.
Something [nonconceptual pristine consciousness] which is neither permanent nor impermanent can hardly be called conditioned. It also cannot be called something that arises from cause and conditions. Nonconceptual pristine consciousness is by definition beyond the range of conventional analysis and can only be discovered for oneself.

The problem is with deluded appearances. The appearances of pristine consciousness are not a problem, and nor can there be any attachment to them. If there is attachment, the appearance is automatically a product of delusion and is delusion.
Then this is only a matter of terminology.

Not really.

Astus said:
All eight consciousnesses and their attendant dharmas are delusion, products of delusion and experiences of delusion.
The question is about experiencing seeds, not delusions. Since seeds are not experienced, they are conceptual assumptions of a theoretical explanation, a philosophical attempt to connect action and fruit.

I didn't say that the seeds were experienced, you really did not understand the sentence. I said:

All delusion is the experience of seeds/traces.

Malcolm wrote:
What I am saying here is that what one experiences is the seeds in the sense that without the seeds/traces there are no deluded experiences to be had.

Rainbow body is formed out of pristine consciousness, or to put it more accurately, when the elements of the body revert to their original nature as pristine consciousness, this is called "rainbow body."

It does not mean that you suddenly burst into rainbow light, if you attain this in this life, ordinary people will still see you just as you were, but perhaps you will not cast a shadow.

I predict a massive swing to the right in the coming decades. Nothing like the Trump bandwagon. Non whites antagonize whites at their own risk. Population issues are nothing, "useless breeders" can easily be adversely affected by a wealthy power minority.


Johnny Dangerous said:
You mean *poor* white people, who are most of Trump's base, and will be the base for similar movements to come. The irony is, they will be lead by people like Trump that don't give two squats about the plight of poor whites, or anyone else, but simply find turning poor people of different races against one another to be politically useful to maintain their oligarchy. Truthfully, it does happen to some degree on the democratic side too, for sure.

"Whites" should get over themselves. They do not even form a coherent ethnic community, unless you define them by the fact that white people in general cannot dance.

I really believe that the moderators here can lighten up a bit, and that goes for language, for topics and for tough debates. The Dharma, and its practitioners, can handle more than what you seem to think. Open the windows, let the fresh air and sunlight stream in.

Some of the rules here would please a Baptist preacher.

( I say this with great love for the mods and the forum, but above all for the Dharma)

Ayu said:
Can you please write a PM to the respective moderators about what you mean exactly? Which cases? Which acts of moderation? This critique is not helpful, because there is not the slightest hint, what you are talking about.

Malcolm wrote:
He means that the moderation here is often a bit overbearing. The moderation team here has heard this complaint before and usually responds with "You have no idea how tolerant we are" followed with "You have no idea how hard it is to be a moderator."

Even so, this does not go beyond delusion.

Anything that is beyond causality is irrelevant in life.

Malcolm wrote:
Causality is a delusion. Further, your assertion proposes that there cannot be a consciousness of any kind which is free of the three realms, which does not take birth in the three realms, that outside of the three realms there can be no sort of consciousness at all.


Astus said:
No, it isn't.
In that case, there is neither enlightenment in this life, nor is it compatible with life.

Malcolm wrote:
Au contraire, this is why we have rainbow body.


Astus said:
This is a subtle reification of things. Your view here is very much the same as the Gelugpa view.
Do you think then that the problem is not (only) with attachment, but with appearances?

Deluded experiences are manifestations of seeds, not the seeds themselves.
