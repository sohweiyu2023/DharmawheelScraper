The language in Sutra is hard to understand. This is the reason why people get caught up with the teachings/tools more than what's the teachings are pointing to. Language of Zen Patriarchs are to understand as well.

Many difficulties regarding relationships in my life lately.

Marital problems possibly leading to divorce or separation soon.
One very important friendship dissolving into fights and negativity. We are temporarily not speaking.
Another heading in the wrong direction that makes it difficult for me to know how to proceed.
Still another with a sudden "change of heart" that makes me very nervous.

Outside of that, there is only one person I see regularly, as I'm a very private person.
So nearly all of the important relationships in my life are, to put it bluntly, in the shitter in some form or another.
I've never had insomnia or such strong feelings of aloneness as right now.
I'm not sure how to bring them to the dharma path.
It's made shamatha very difficult, to say the least.

Of course this brings home the samsaric qualities of every relationship. But how bittersweet to see it in your own life, and in such a large amount at one time. My instinct isn't towards cultivating insight but just some way to not feel so bad.
For now, I just say some mantras, manis mostly.

Thanks for anyone's advice, who has maybe been in a similar situation.

Astus said:
Kamalashila's Bhavanakramas are instructions for meditation. I dare say that even the Middle Treatise of Nagarjuna is good for meditation, not to mention the many prajnaparamita sutras. Just as Vajrayana texts can be taken for purely philosophical writings, so can the teachings of the Buddha can and often are mistaken as theoretical matters. Analysis is not meant for achieving an objective statement but to attain insight. I'm not even sure why it happens that while it is obvious that the Dharma is for liberation, teachings are regularly dismissed as if they were products of a bored academic. It is another thing that philosophy is viewed with contempt, calling it idle talk. But once we rename it as ideology, it becomes more apparent how thoughts govern action.

For instance, when there is a teaching about the aggregates, it is not about abstract ideas with no relevance to one's personal life and experience, but instructions on what and how to investigate in order to see the true nature of reality and gain liberation. It is always about direct seeing, that's what vipasyana is. Reducing the words of the Buddha and numerous teachers to mere theorising is not just insulting but inconsiderate and ignorant. (And I'm not saying here, Cone, that you are like that, these are just my general observations.)

It is not a question of conceptuality but how those concepts are understood. Keeping a distance between oneself and some ideas is when it is mere theorising, fantasising about things that have no weight. On the other hand, when a concept is taken seriously, when it is reflected on and connected to one's experience, that is heeding the advice and following the teachings. It becomes a personal matter. Just like when one can listen to any teacher and not find anything noteworthy in his words, if that teacher is seen as one's guru, even the most innocent movements become Dharma instructions.

Malcolm wrote:
Here is your original question:

Astus said:
How can it be argued that the popular methods lacking the conceptual methods of discerning appearances are valid?

Malcolm wrote:
Mañjuśrimitra in the Meditation of Bodhicitta would have replied to Kamalaśila in the following way:
When analyzing the extremes of deconstruction and proofs for entities by the reason of direct perception and so on,
after that domain of those who follow the stream of concepts is defined as authoritative,
because the conceptualized extreme does not exist, there is no extreme to analyze, and if there is no core, what can be defined as an authority?
Therefore, the conventions of mundane analysis are not necessary in this yoga.
Keep in mind, the Meditation of Bodhicitta is a text aimed Mahāyānis just like Kamalaśila, oriented towards showing that this kind of analysis is just not necessary at all in Mahāyāna.   That in fact, it is an obstacle to understanding the real meaning of Mahāyāna.

The point is that the methods of conceptual analysis are invalid for ultimate analysis, as Mipham points out in his commentary on this text:
...a mundane authority is not valid for an ultimate analysis,
Why is this important? Because in general, the whole notion of direct perceptions, inferences, and so on are defined on the basis of of the conceptual cognitions of ordinary people. Therefore:
Therefore, the conventions of mundane analysis are not necessary in this yoga.
Which yoga? Mahāyāna yoga.

So the question must be turned around:

Astus said:
How can it be argued that conceptual methods of discerning appearances are valid?

Malcolm wrote:
Incidentally, Mañjuśrimitra never once uses the term "Ati yoga" or "Dzogchen" in this text, though he does make reference to Vajrasattva, Mahāyoga concepts and Samantabhadri. He also on the other hand uses Prajñāpāramitā references, even working the name "Arhat Subhuti" into the text to represent a principle of the teachings.

Have most people who do yidam practice and highest yoga tantra completed long shamatha retreats? It's supposed to take 6 months in retreat to master shamatha, isn't it?

Is there a definitive list of practices that are considered A-okay before one has done a shamatha retreat? Is it effective to do non-ngondro prostrations, like the 3 heaps sutra, before mastering shamatha?

When we say Dzogchen teachings are "secret", it does mean they are secret in the sense of a classified document which only people with proper clearance can read — though certainly this is a prevailing attitude evinced by the plethora of "restricted books." Dzogchen teachings are secret because their meaning is obscure to those who still are involved with the vehicles of cause and result. This is the real sense of secrecy in Dzogchen teachings.

The difference between a buddha and sentient being is just the difference recognition and nonrecognition.

If even temporary cessation of ideation cannot overcome that fundamental ignorance, what kind of experience is it that can?

With regards to the OP quote, it is no secret that many Lamas have different styles of transmission based on their own understanding and how they feel the teachings will root the most deeply and effectively in their students hearts.
Malcolm,

I remember you explaining something quite similar to us on e-sangha. The word I remember you using at that time was "fiefdom" though. How in old tibet, each lama had their own fiefdom. This stayed with me because I often thought about how much of a transition they all had to make, coming out of Tibet as they did. Lama Chime often said that he went directly from living in the eighth century to living in the twentieth century.

There are many approaches to practices. Why? Because everyone is different and the fact that everyone is different is not a trivial matter.

And we are off topic again sort of-- the point isn't keeping things secret it's about authentic transmission. Shri Singha didn't just write it down and publish it widely in Tibet-- he gave an oral transmission to Vairotsana until both of them were satisfied with his understanding, then he left to return to Tibet to bring the teachings there, and transmit them from master to disciple. You can read the different lineages of Dzogchen and how they were transmitted to whom and how they were carried forth in the History of the Nyingma book of HH Dudjom Rinpoche. Nowhere does it say "and then this disciple never met a human master but found a text in a bookstore and achieved full realization after reading it over and over again". It is through the master disciple relationship that the teaching has always been transmitted- not through books - and this is what ChNN teaches and what you yourself affirmed at the beginning of the thread.

Malcolm wrote:
I was addressing the intent of the story you raised. The purpose of Śrī Siṃha's teaching Dzogchen in such a ridiculous fashion had nothing to do with generally keeping Dzogchen teachings secret, it had to do with fooling the Indian King and Panditas so Vairocana could return with Dzogchen teachings Tibet.

Everything in Buddhadharma needs to transmitted from master to disciple, no exceptions, even sūtra knowledge.

Not sure how that is relevant to anything I said, number of students is not really a part of the question is it? Anyway Shri Singha was whispering the Great Perfection teachings through a long copper pipe to Vairotsana in the middle of the night, only teaching the cause and result teachings to him openly during the light of day.

Malcolm wrote:
This is because, as we know, that Indians were jealous and did not want to the Tibetans to receive the teachings. Therefore, to confuse the their diviners, in the earliest account we have [from the Bairo rgyud 'bum ], Śrī Simha devised a ridiculous method of granting the teachings:
On the surface of three large boulders he placed an iron jar inside of a net. After the ācarya sat inside of it, he had the top filled with water and closed. Having run a clay pipe through a hole in the wall, those two monks where on the outside of the wall. As a precaution, they put their boots on backwards, they put long hoods on their heads, and listened.
When the Indian King tried to find out who had given the teachings to the Tibetans:
Since it was asked which person bestowed them, also no one wished to reply, it was said “It is necessary to examine the mirror”. The mirror diviner said “The abbot who is explaining the Great Perfection, the Dharma of transcendent intimate instructions, is sitting on a rock, his body is filled with eyes. He is seated on the surface of three large rocks. A lake has arisen over his head. He is giving the explanation with a long beak. Two with long deerskin hoods are listening from outside.”

Since the Dharma protecting king and all the pandits said “This is incredible, are they emanations of an asura? They cannot be clearly identified from the mirror. It must be no other than the two Tibetans. It is clear from the water divination that a swift runner must be sent.”
This indicates that the Great Perfection was quite well known to the Indians at that time, not such a huge secret.

If, as Kamalashila states, analysis is a necessary element of the path, it excludes all other options to reach insight into the nature of reality. Consequently, there can be no direct methods (pointing to the nature of mind, empowerment, direct introduction, etc.) that avoid using analysis. How can it be argued that the popular methods lacking the conceptual methods of discerning appearances are valid?

"Those who do not meditate with wisdom by analysing individually the entity of things, but merely meditate on elimination of mental activity, cannot avert conceptual thoughts and also cannot realise identitylessness because one lacks the light of wisdom. If the fire of consciousness knowing phenomena as they are is produced from individual analysis of suchness, then like the fire produced by rubbing wood it will burn the wood of conceptual thought."
( Middle Stages of Meditation )

"Thus it is on the basis of obtaining unobscured knowledge that one understands every single teaching of the Buddha. Hence without the discernment of reality there is no arising of perfect knowledge, nor also the abandonment of the afflictive obscurations."

Besides the remarks I've already made, I really can't see how it would make a practical difference whether you believe in rebirth or not. At the end of a day, in either case you are practising NOW, in THIS life and you are trying to end suffering starting here and now. Not in a million lifetimes from now.  Some even want to reach liberation in one lifetime. And that's one more reason why I think the quote was misused.
If someone doesn't believe in rebirth, he could well be inclined to seek nirvana in this very life even if it is the only one. If it's not ok to go through samsara for eons, then it's not ok to go through it even for a lifetime, and as little as I have read so far, I know this is something the Buddha has said himself. Even a second of samsara is not worth living. So I really don't see why such a perpective of practice should be frowned upon or disparaged in such a way. The goal is the same and the mens to achieve it are the same.

Malcolm wrote:
You need to read the entire teachings:
If you have attachment to this life, you are not a Dharma practitioner. 
If you have attachment to samsara, you do not have renunciation. 
If you have attachment to your own purpose, you do not have bodhicitta.
If you have grasping, you do not have the view.
This means if you are only working for this life's happiness and freedom from suffering, you are not a Dharma practitioner. If you are practicing Dharma for higher rebirth only, you do not have renunciation. If you are only interested in your own liberation, you do not have bodhicitta, the motivation to become Buddha for the benefit of everyone. If you have grasping [to the view of self, etc.], you do not have the view.

The fact is that someone who does not accept rebirth automatically has wrong views and thus will not even be capable of stream entry. They will not understand why they are suffering and therefore, will not be capable of removing the cause of their suffering, just as a doctor who does not properly diagnose the cause of an illness will not be able to apply the proper treatment for that illness.

Lots of masters and traditional texts say that you should have a close personal relationship with a guru, proper guidance and personal instruction, and whatnot, but since ChNN is constantly travelling it seems very difficult to receive these, so all you're left is with a bunch of books with complex practices to try on your own.

Basically, the difference between a real teacher of Dzogchen and someone who only teaches Dzogchen as a theory is that real teachers of Dzogchen teach Dzogchen as the basis. Others teach it as a result of a path, like Mahāmudra. In a real sense, when Dzogchen is taught as the apex of the nine yānas for example, this is merely to contrast Dzogchen with the eight vehicles of cause and result.

Just one more question: In another thread it was mentioned that ChNN on the last day of a retreat gave out really lots of stuff. How do I have to interpret this? Reading through this list it'd be impossible to practice all these things. At the same time, there are for example individual mantras listed, which in my eyes are quite useless without having a complete instruction set. So, how do I have to understand this?

Under Republican administrations, the size of the Gvt. always increases. The only time the size of the Gvt. decreased in recent history was under Bill Clinton, who also balanced the budget. The Bush II ruined all of that, along with the economy, stripped us of our civil liberties, used 9/11 as a pretext to punish Hussein, etc.

Nevertheless, small government does not necessarily equal good government, nor to a large government necessarily equal bad government. These categories are too simplistic.

trump is educated and runs has done business all over the world and he is not taking bribes from special interest groups. voting for trump (or other non politicians) sends a powerful message to the republican establishment that they cant keep running the same game on us.

Malcolm wrote:
Trump is educated, even though he talks and behaves like a dumbass — but he thinks nothing of letting his companies go bankrupt. He has filed bankruptcy four times in eighteen years, that is an average of one bankruptcy every 4.5 years. How is this good business? If anything, this just proves that wealthy people in this country are treated differently than the little guy, just as white kids are treated differently than black kids when it comes to be being busted for possession of marijuana:

mossy said:
But Trump’s multiple spells in bankruptcy court, and the little effect they have played on his abundant wealth, highlights the stiff gap between how businesses and consumers are treated amid financial strife. The Trump businesses, as with many companies, were afforded significant leeway in the hope they could recoup those massive debts.

Malcolm wrote:

Also, Trump is not a "conservative". He was a registered Democrat from 2001 to 2008. He said to CNN:

mossy said:
Before Donald Trump was a front-running Republican presidential candidate, the real estate mogul believed that the nation's economy ran better when Democrats were in control and that Hillary Clinton would be a strong negotiator with foreign nations.

"In many cases, I probably identify more as Democrat," Trump told CNN's Wolf Blitzer in a 2004 interview. "It just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats than the Republicans. Now, it shouldn't be that way. But if you go back, I mean it just seems that the economy does better under the Democrats. ...But certainly we had some very good economies under Democrats, as well as Republicans. But we've had some pretty bad disaster under the Republicans."

Malcolm wrote:

Or are you so cynical that you do not believe that the US can evolve from its present destructive courses of action? Basically, having a reasonable leadership in the US is in everyone's best interest, I would hope that you would not be encouraging the international rise of political demagoguery, and I would imagine that you do not fail to see that having a person like Trump in power will inevitably lead to further chaos and destruction, mostly of other countries. In this case, it seems, if the US is getting the leaders it deserves, those leaders just keep wreaking havoc on others. Unfortunately, we did not get it right with Obama. Hopefully, with someone like Sanders we would get it right, because the Democrats and Republicans are deeply out of touch with reality and the rest of the world, for the most part.

The practice path begins with receiving direct introduction, and then working to stabilize that recognition within oneself. There are many different approaches to this from learning Vajra Dance to Yantra Yoga, doing the special Dzogchen preliminaries and so on — no single approach suits everyone, but in general everyone tries a bit of all of it until they figure out what is working for them.

According to this writer, Trump needs to convince a majority of black voters to abandon the Democratic Party for him. Not likely, considering the history of the Republican Party since the majority of Southern Democrats abandoned the Democratic party over abortion and other issues...

The other thing, which is really clear, is that we do not have an "immigration problem." This is just a fantasy concocted by Trump to create media hysteria and whip up the Tea Party folks into a xenophobic frenzy.

Required reading:

The so-called illegal immigration problem was entirely caused by US interference in Latin American countries, the war on drugs, NAFTA, etc.

Illegal immigrants are not here to steal your job, rape your wife or daughter, etc. Illegal immigrants are not responsible for the heroin epidemic sweeping the US. Why?

Thanks for sharing, Malcolm.

Both teachers have my respect and gratitude for bringing their teaching to the West. I read some of Chogyal Namkhai Norbu's works a while ago, from his remarkably extensive bibliography. Too bad Kunzang Dechen Lingpa passed on already. Luckily Norbu is still around, isn't he? Norbu spoke quite freely about the teachings as far as I remember, which I found very refreshing, although learning from books is not really all too instructive - especially for a Dzogchen newb like me. Maybe I get a chance to meet him sometime.

Did you get a chance to receive a direct introduction from him? Or how does he work?

Well, there are many web casts, free. He always gives transmission during these. Depending on your circumstances however, it is good to go see him in person and meet with many fellow students.

Yes, I'd be very sorry if he was elected and like you I am really happy Bernie Sanders's ideas are getting some serious exposure. I hope he goes further than anybody expects.

But one of the matters that is profoundly wrong in the political discourse in the US, the way I see it, is actual absence of such. People get hot under the collar if you even mention the candidate they don't like, it is so black-and-white (no pun intended this time). There is a wide-spread inability to even try to even countenance the other point of view and this dogmatism and polarisation is a very serious issue, IMO.

If you are looking that way, check out the Buddhist priests executed by the Japanese for opposing the Empire. There are several anarchist leaning Buddhist thinkers in pre- and post-war Japan.

Going west, Korean monks led the anti-Japanese/anti-Korean gov't uprisings before annexation, but I am not sure if that counts here. The 1980s saw the development of Masses' Buddhism (Minjung Bulkyo) in Korea and there are a couple of English language books  about it. It is definitely anti-state, but was so incoherent and poorly thought out that there is little intellectual engagement possible, except as a historical study of  the more wide ranging shift of Korean Buddhism to more enagement with civilians.

If memory serves, there are some early 20th Century Chinese Buddhist thinkers who at least flirted with serious  engagement with anarchist thought.

Yes, although there doesn't seem to be an essential difference between theory and practice. My experience is, that it's more like two sides of one coin. At least for me, since it were spontaneous experiences that lead me to study emptiness in the first place.

"You say, ‘A buddha has six supernatural powers. This is miraculous!’ All the gods, immortals, asuras, and mighty pretas also have supernatural powers—must they be considered buddhas? Followers of the Way, make no mistake! For instance, when Asura fought against Indra and was routed in battle he led his entire throng, to the number of eighty-four thousand, into the tube in a fiber of a lotus root to hide. Wasn’t he then a sage? Such supernatural powers as these I have just mentioned are all reward powers or dependent powers.
Those are not the six supernatural powers of a buddha, which are entering the world of color yet not being deluded by color; entering the world of sound yet not being deluded by sound; entering the world of odor yet not being deluded by odor; entering the world of taste yet not being deluded by taste; entering the world of touch yet not being deluded by touch; entering the world of dharmas yet not being deluded by dharmas. Therefore, when it is realized that these six—color, sound, odor, taste, touch, and dharmas— are all empty forms, they cannot bind the man of the Way, dependent upon nothing. Constituted though he is of the seepage of the five skandhas, he has the supernatural power of walking upon the earth."

As I said, since you do not understand the basic terms of the conversation, it is hard to have this conversation with you.

Unconditioned space is considered a fifth "element", and consciousness is considered the sixth. The universe is made up, from a Buddhist point of view, only of these six elements. When we say these things are elements, it does not mean they are single substances. When we say consciousness is an element, we mean the aggregates of all consciousness taken together is a component or element of the universe, since the universe contains sentient beings.

Actually according to the theory, time started with the big bang, as time is just one of several dimensions along with spatial ones. There was no time before the expansion, according to the theory. This does not mean that the theory is right, but at least it points to the fact that logic and mathematics allow the possibility of time having a beginning and being caused by something apparently uncaused.

Stephen Hawking said:
At this time, the Big Bang, all the matter in the universe, would have been on top of itself. The density would have been infinite. It would have been what is called, a singularity. At a singularity, all the laws of physics would have broken down. This means that the state of the universe, after the Big Bang, will not depend on anything that may have happened before, because the deterministic laws that govern the universe will break down in the Big Bang. The universe will evolve from the Big Bang, completely independently of what it was like before. Even the amount of matter in the universe, can be different to what it was before the Big Bang, as the Law of Conservation of Matter, will break down at the Big Bang.

There's also Pure Land which is based on the belief that liberation will come postmortem. Mahāyāna's traditional understanding of 'liberation' is not what you describe strictly speaking: you are only liberated from involuntary rebirth after a certain point way down the path, but until then you're committed to engaging in beneficial activities, though ideally your wisdom prevents suffering while your compassion enables continued countless rebirths rather than seeking arhatship.

All this is beside the point — but address your rebuttal — Chan/Zen do not offer some special model of liberation separate and unique. It is based on common Mahāyāna.

And this is merely a variation on the never-returner.

It may be the case that in the common Mahāyāna path one does not eradicate afflictions that cause rebirth in the desire realm until the eighth bhumi, nevertheless, this is because the bhumis of Mahāyāna stream entry are 1-6, once returner is the seventh bhumi, never-returner is eighth bhumi and so on.

Still, the model is all based on the afflictive obscurations that cause rebirth in the three realms. Liberation is not omniscience.

Stream entrants up to Arhats are all liberated, will never take rebirth in the three lowers realms, and their final liberation is guaranteed.

Either side led to people having consistent and enriching experiences of some kind, which may or may not be mutually comparable depending on who you talk to. Perhaps the Buddhists had different versions of liberation too. In fact, this very much seems to be the case. What liberation means to a Pure Land practitioner (perhaps a vision of Amitabha near death) is different from what it would be to a Vajrayana or Zen practitioner.

Basically I'm just saying don't be so dogmatic.

Malcolm wrote:
In the Hinayāna system, a stream entrant is guaranteed to reach the stage of an arhat within seven lifetimes.

There is no such guarantee in Mahāyāna because the path is necessarily longer. It takes two incalculable eons to reach the eighth bhumi, and another incalculable eon to reach buddhahood after that. So, one does not necessarily progress beyond the level one reached in the past life, but eventually one will. Once one has reached the first bodhisattva stage, one no longer returns to samsara, so to speak, meaning that one's progress to buddhahood is a certainty.

Hello,

One thing that's not explained in what I have been reading about karma and rebirth, is how exactly the benefits in the previous life of a buddhist are carried over to the next lives. For example, at what point does the reincarnation of a great master reconnect with the spiritual level reached previously? Is the same level still present at birth (like, if he died a stream-enterer he is reborn with the same spiritual characteristics as a stream-enterer and instinctively perceives what any stream-enterer should perceive about dharma), or does he have to undergo the same type of training as any other child, except that the whole process goes much faster for him?

Eidul-Adha sacrifices are usually done by wealthy families that go buy a few dozen sheep, have them slaughtered, keep one for the head of the family to slaughter, and then give the meat to the local mosque where it is then given out to the needy. In the Muslim countries where I have lived, that would represent about one family out of ten, or less.

Malcolm wrote:
Do they support it? For example, let us say you are soldier in a unit of 100 soldiers. This group kills one man. If everyone in that group soldiers approves of the action, they bear the karma of killing that one man times the number of people in the group, thus each soldier now bears the karma of killing one hundred men.

For example, all the Americans who approved of the killing of Iraqis and rejoiced in it each bear the amount of karma times the millions of Americans who approved of that killing. The same is true of any war and all soldiers in it. This is why the Buddha clearly explains that soldiers _Never_ take higher rebirth.

In the case of sacrifice it is the same. If you approve of the killing of animals for sacrifice, or even for consumption of meat, you bear the responsibility of all of the animals whose deaths you are knowingly involved in. If you approve in general of Eidul-Adha then you are culpable for all those deaths times the number of people who approve and rejoice.

Of course, I don't on what authority he is making that claim, just that he has made it on occasion.

Also, China is not so far from Tibet, and there were a number of Chan masters who in fact were Tibetans from far-eastern Tibet, or so I read in some academic book somewhere.

The trouble with this question is that only someone who is trained in both Dzogchen and Zen can even begin to properly address it. And then the rest of us will still be none the wiser really.

Sure I believe that Zen training can lead to complete liberation and so can Dzogchen, but this is just a belief. Those who believe that one can and the other one can't will similarly hold beliefs. Basically they are of no value outside supporting one's practice, ie of no objective value.

Or so it seems to me.

Malcolm wrote:
The the question of the similarities and differences between Chan and Dzogchen arose because some early Tibetologists erroneously asserted that Dzogchen derived from what we call Early Northern Chan.

There is a book by a 9th century Tibetan master, Nubchen Sangye Yeshe, which extensively examines the differences in the positions of Kamalashila and Hashang Mahāyāna, favors Hashang in terms of sūtrayāna presentations, but nevertheless asserts that Mahāyoga, even though gradual, is more efficacious than EN Chan because Mahāyoga has direct introduction, something lacking in EN Chan as it was practiced in 8th century in Tibet. Needless to say, it presents Atiyoga, Dzogchen as the pinnacle of vehicles.

Chogyal Namkhai Norbu stresses that the Chan examined by Nubchen is not the same as Zen. He asserts that modern Zen has been deeply influenced by Esoteric Buddhism.

The upshot is that when we have discussions of the relationship between Chan and Dzogchen, this has virtually no bearing on what people now a days practice as Zen, Chan or Son. For example, the Koan system did not even exist during this period of time, there was no Rinzai, no Soto, etc. The Chan under question is Early Northern Chan, and its sources and influence in Tibetan Buddhism all but ended in the 790's when the Tibetans chose Indian Buddhism as the gold standard.

Is this method widely or at all used by other teachers/lamas?

fckw said:
I'm not sure if this question is directed to me. Personally, I don't know any other Buddhist teacher who teaches this way. Mr. Brown a few times told the story when he attended teachings given by a Tibetan yogi. Apparently he had received an invitation by H. H. Dalai Lama (?) who had announced these teachings to be somewhat special. Now, the special thing about the teachings were that said yogi actually performed the practice while teaching it. This left a deep impression.

One notable exception of someone also teaching in this style (but having made up his own meditation system for better or worse) is this guy, whose eclectic teachings I personally find quite interesting.. However, it's nothing I personally practice or have practiced. (Brown and him are in no way affiliated.)

One of the most important meditation instructions I ever received from any teacher to me was given by Brown. He pointed out to me a state of mind in meditation which is quiet and calm and relatively free of thoughts - but it's not bright and clear. It's fundamentally a state of dullness that leads nowhere. I immediately knew what he meant and from then on completely avoided this state. I had gone already much further in my meditation, but sporadically got stuck during meditation in that state without understanding it. None of my former teachers had ever pointed this out to me before.

zenman said:
I am familiar with this way of teaching, that is, the teacher doing the practice at the same time when giving students instructions. I don't know a better way to pass meditation teachings than this.

I also know Anadi. Somehow interesting fellow. However I haven't been able to make any sense of what he actually says. He keeps on repeating his terminology (while his students in the vids keep asking him the same questions again and again) but manages not to explain what he actually means. I like untraditional and creative approach but unfortunately I just cannot follow what this man means, despite of having listened to him for couple of hours.

Pointing unaware or semi-aware fields of one's mind is also something that I am familiar with when working with a teacher. Invaluable pointing! I'd say. FCKW, did that particular dull state have a specific name? Is that mentioned in Brown's book? The reason I am asking is because I have also received this pointing (not from Brown). I didn't avoid it though but pierced it.

Malcolm wrote:

Per Madhyamaka reasoning, but not according to Vedanta.

Vedanta disagrees with the "not from itself" causation. The primary example is the clay-pot. The pot depends on the clay, but the clay does not depend on the pot.

Where Vedanta gets fuzzy how it explains the mechanism of maya. But there is a famous story about an Advaitin yogi who had everything figured out except for maya. He was told not to worry about it. I think Vedanta runs into trouble because it has to square its findings with the Vedas.

Malcolm wrote:
Time cannot depend on Brahman; if it did, Brahman would be conditioned.
The clay depends on the four elements. It is also conditioned, which is why it can form another conditioned entity.

Vedanta's roots are Samkhya. It never really manages to escape those roots, which is why is never really manages to overcome the Madhyamaka refutation of satkaryavāda — even though this point of view was rejected by Gaudapada in favor of ajativāda, which he borrowed from Madhyamaka.

By contrast the roots of Madhyamaka view and all Buddhist teaching in general is dependent origination. The Buddhist concept of nonarising found in the Prajñāpāramitā comes out of this insight.

That's why time depends on Brahman and not the other way around. If one wants to get technical, one can say that time and space are an illusory appearance of Brahman. In fact, Advaitins teachers often argue that time is change, and that change is only known against a backdrop of changelessness (the atman).

The Advaita view I am familiar with has at least three levels of reality: 1) the really real (sat), or Brahman, which is beyond time, space, etc. 2) the really unreal (asat), such as the horns of a rabbit or the son of a barren woman, and 3) the real/unreal, or "mithya" which has both qualities. Time would be "mithya", and therefore dependent on Brahman. This "mithya" is compared to a dream which is both dependent on and at the same time non-different from the dreamer. However, while the dream depends on the dreamer, the dreamer does not depend on the dream.

I don't own Derrida stock.  I'm looking at ways of looking at texts that point back to the guru, the oral tradition, the lineage of blessings, and not just the texts themselves so we can get beyond an endless debate as to what texts really mean.  Have realization? Hold oral tradition?  Lineage holder?  Then you know.  Otherwise not.

Malcolm wrote:
But this has nothing to do with "post structuralism" and everything to do with the fact that Buddhadharma is an oral tradition, in essence.

Unknown said:
If we decide that there is a life to Buddhist texts beyond marks on paper, and if we recognize the oral tradition of the lineage to be what unlocks the meaning of those marks on a piece of paper-- then we examine a teacher, his or her qualifications, and his or her qualities, and study those texts with that person.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, I know, and I think Derrida is an intellectual dilettante — but hey, that's just me.

Urgyen Dorje said:
I think with dharma texts that context is the valid cognition of realized beings and the oral tradition of lineage masters that continues that valid cognition.  Without that context those texts can be anything.  And people do make them anything.  So for me, there are dharma texts, marks on pages, and the unbroken lineage of realization that unlocks those texts.  The marks on the page make no sense without the unbroken lineage of realization to unlock them.  This is why it's absurd, from my side as a practitioner, when academics study texts without any reference to the living tradition, and when students attempt to study texts without any guidance from the living tradition.  I think an approach like this shuts down academic chauvinism, false lamas, teacher-less students, modernists, all in one swoop.

Malcolm wrote:
What you desire is the opposite of your method. And in any case, this notion of "valid cognition of realized beings" is highly problematic. How does anyone know who is realized and who is not? This is why texts have words, and those words have invariable meanings. Even if you are not realized, as long as you understand and convey the the meaning, there is always a possibility someone can wake up from the meaning you have communicated as long as you have a valid lineage.

If it's against the view of dharma, please red pill me on that.

From my vantage point, this approach immediately derails the views of many who feel that they can study the dharma on their own by reading texts without resorting to a teacher.  It also derials the views of many who feel that they can just buy books and complete a shedra without relying on teachers for clarification of the difficult points in the source materials.  It also derails the view that many have that they can expound on tantric materials, dzogchen, mahamudra, after simply receiving instructions.

From my vantage point this puts everything back on the valid cogintion of a buddha.  Might be a realized teacher, might be a holder of the oral tradition and lineage of blessings of a realized teacher.

But definitely something trans-textual.

Without this, the texts are just marks on paper.  Or we're as good as blind.
As such a post structural approach to texts gives the dharma texts an infinite space of interpretation according to the realization of the teacher and the needs of the students.

To diagnose the persons illness is hard, especially over the web, but to know the right medicine for that person is practically impossible, IMO. What certainty can there be in such an uncertain endeavour? Skilful means are not about certainty but about skill. So the question then becomes whether certainty is skilful, ie helpful. What do people think about that?

When having an interfaith dialog, one can either focus on the differences between the paths or the similarities.  If one focuses on the differences, the conversation will be about nothing but differences, and that's fine.  But if one focuses on similarities, and those similarities may only be "similar" in that they reflect the other persons interests, one has a point of connection.  A point of connection is more important than an ocean of differences if one wants to acknowledge and nurture some one's interest in dharma.  Not every difference and confusion needs to be addressed at once.  So generally the approach to real interfaith dialog is to find common ground on a couple points and share there.

So here we have a Muslim with a serious interest in Buddhism.

If a non-Buddhist person is interested in the Dharma, that is great. But in order to understand what Dharma is they have to understand first the differences between the Dharma and the religion they are currently following.

I have been reading about early buddhism and the multiplication of different schools of thought following a number of schisms. Some of them seem to be quite divergent from each other, sometimes even opposed (like sarvastivada and theravada) in their theories about reality, existence and so on, which makes me wonder if all those treatises and theories were really written and developped by 'attained' people or rather by simple philosophers who tried to rationalise the universe using the brain instead of through direct knowledge, like western philosophers did with Christianity?
Also, are these developments still seen as useful and exploitable in terms of spiritual development today, or simply as a phase in buddhist history?

Thanks

Malcolm wrote:
It really depends on which school you are interested in. Zen, Son and Theravadin schools [for different reasons] do not seem to have much problem accommodating theists. Most expressions of Tibetan Buddhism however would require you to take refuge in Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, and that means you would have to relinquish your former religious affiliations and beliefs. They would maintain one cannot find refuge in non-Buddhist deities if one has found refuge in the Buddha. So there is a difference in refuge.

There is a difference of view — Buddhadharma utterly rejects the notion of an efficient creator god, or even a formal one. It instead proposes there is no absolute beginning, and relies in the notion of dependent origination and emptiness to explain everything. The Buddha maintained that views other than the view of dependent origination were false.

There is a difference in path — since Buddhadharma rejects God in toto because of the view of dependent origination, liberation depends solely on one's own efforts and there is no external moral agency that one has to satisfy or worship. Liberation depends solely on recognizing one's own nature. There is nothing with which to unify, no transcendent principle binding all beings together, etc.

There is a difference in conduct -- we will leave this aside for now.

There is a difference in result — the result of practicing Buddhadharma is Buddhahood. Buddhahood cannot be attained in non-Buddhist paths.

That's a pretty wild association to make. Over half of the African continent does not practice religious slaughters as seen in Abrahamic religions, yet subsaharan Africa is in a much more dire situation than many Muslim countries...

If it can be experienced, it is relative. A relative mind cannot experience anything unconditioned. It is simply impossible. Also, in Buddhadharma there are only three unconditioned things, generally, space and the two kinds of cessation. [In Mahāyāna we add emptiness, but that is beyond discussion here].

Nirvana has two meanings but it is not an experience. It is a kind of knowledge that you will no longer take rebirth in samsara because you have exhausted afflictions, and second, when you die, your continuum ceases with regard to afflictive rebirth in the three realms. Beyond this, we move in the Mahāyāna Buddhology, which is a little more complex.

Second, the word translated as 'eternal' (usually khalid) has been very much debated among Muslim scholars as to what it really means. Is it really absolute eternity, or is it ond of those semitic exaggerations to signify 'a very long period of time'. Many have favored the second option, on the basis of some evidence which I don't remember, with this same word being used for obviously non-eternal events.

We have constant information from the OT Prophets that they communicated directly with a being they gave various names, and they report this entity took and takes a generational interest in their people from a very early time.

The "chosen people" meme has been one of the most destructive in human history because it gives a certain population a teleological claim to primacy and favor.

I think we agree on the major points.

That the Abrahamic traditions aren't dharma paths, no matter how contemplative and mystical they might be.

That gyalpo provocations are real and have causes and solutions as indicated in the tradition.

Red pill me though on why the Abrahamic god actually exists?  In that case I would probably interpret many things differently...

Malcolm wrote:
Religions do not form without cause. As far as I am concerned the actual "god" of the OT, NT and Koran is a rgyal po, more than one. rGyal pos delight on conflict and causing people to break samaya.

And it seems to me that whatever adaptions of Greek Philosophy and so on Christians, Jews and Muslims may have made, again and again all three religions traditions become involved in paranoia, dominance and political power [the Jews, post Temple, much less so because of their long history of persecution, but these days, Israel?"]. For this reason I personally think that backbone of these traditions is sustained by a rgyal po/rgyal pos, and it can be more than one.

You kept asking the question, are all these people rgyal po worshippers — of course not. I never said they were. If your philosophical definition of the divine is drawn from Aristotle or Plotinus, of course not.

But it does not mean that you are not in the company of people whose concept of god feeds right into and feeds the egos of this kind of dregs pa.

There can be many kinds of gdon associated with a religion. There gdon associated with the US Government, dkor bdags [owners of donations, literally] and so on.

One reason why it is so hard for people to get off of the dole is that when one gets into debt with the government or the banks, and so on, the influence of the dkor bdags who rule your debt, Gvt. property and so on, keep you poor until you get free of the debt by paying it off.

Some people never get free, and this kind of provocation can be passed on in families for generations. This is why it best not to carry much debt. And if you have debt you cannot pay, it is better to declare bankruptcy.

I am sure some of you reading this think I am insane, thinking "What? Spirits who have an interest in Bank and Welfar debt? What a crazy idea!" In reality, even secular institutions have their nonhuman protectors, whether they recognize them or not.

Obviously there are many people who subscribe to this belief, if the Pope had to criticize it. So how have the Catholic Theologians defined God then?

Caodemarte said:
The one absolutely and infinitely perfect spirit who is the Creator of all. In the definition of the First Vatican Council, fifteen internal attributes of God are affirmed, besides his role as Creator of the universe: "The holy, Catholic, apostolic Roman Church believes and professes that there is one true, living God, the Creator and Lord of heaven and earth. He is almighty, eternal, beyond measure, incomprehensible, and infinite in intellect, will and in every perfection. Since He is one unique spiritual substance, entirely simple and unchangeable, He must be declared really and essentially distinct from the world, perfectly happy in Himself and by his very nature, and inexpressibly exalted over all things that exist or can be conceived other than Himself" (Denzinger 3001).

Reflecting on the nature of God, theology has variously identified what may be called his metaphysical essence, i.e., what is God. It is commonly said to be his self-subsistence. God is Being Itself. In God essence and existence coincide. He is the Being who cannot not exist. God alone must be. All other beings exist only because of the will of God.

Malcolm wrote:
There are fifteen problems with this definition. So this is the definition of God, it is a nice tidy philosopher's definition and just as sterile. It is also perfectly Aristotelian in nature [as are similar Islamic definitions]:
[Et vita autem] And life also belongs to God; for the actuality of thought is life, and God is that actuality; and God’s self-dependent actuality is life most good and eternal. We say therefore that God is a living being, eternal, most good, so that life and duration continuous and eternal belong to God; for this is God.
Yes, the doctrine of the Rapture is a Scottish innovation.

Theologians like Tillich were pretty clear that God existed, this is why he uses the term "ground of being" to describe God. A term, sadly, that has been misappropriated by some translators of Dzogchen texts [without any reasoned basis at all].

I don't think this is the part anyone was objecting to. For my part, I share some of these beliefs, and think that some practitioners of monotheism are engaging in something that will, and does lead to something bad, and are spurred on by some conflict-gobbling big ugly. That said, I know plenty of other practitioners of those faiths who are very far from being in that category, despite sharing a common religion, who I do not think are engaged in anything like this at all. Additionally, when one looks at different parts of these religions, one does find practitioners who seem to be doing something meritorious.

We generally accept that the pantheon of Hindu devas are real, albeit worldly entities. For example, Shiva, often portrayed as a transcendent deva in Hindu sources, is a worldly protector in Buddhist sources.

Zhang Qian had been very lucky to escape twice from Xiongnu captivity, and he was not anxious to enter their territory again.

If those southwestern Chinese goods had reached Bactria from India, there had to be a more direct route connecting India and China. He suggested to Wudi that he send expeditions to explore other ways to get to India that circumvented the Xiongnu. Wudi took his advice and did so, but without success. In order to get from Sichuan to India, the only possible land route was to cut through the mountainous regions of Yunnan, which was then outside the bounds of China. People living in that area saw no benefit to themselves from any encroachment of Han trade routes into their territory. They resisted or killed any intruders. As a result, dangerous though it might be, the steppe route remained the most viable thoroughfare to Central Asia and parts further west.

If you look just at texts, I'd agree with you.  The Abrahamic texts are pretty grotesque for the most part.   My only point of departure is that there is an extra-textual aspect to all religion, and as Tibetan Buddhists we should be pretty aware of that as our texts are grotesque separated from the living tradition.

Malcolm wrote:
Sure, the anuttarayoga tantras can be seen as pretty gross and repellent. This is why they are supposed to be secret. But we don't do a very good job of that as a tradition, for example, Buddhadharma Quarterly this month has a picture of Vajrayogini on the cover drinking from a skull cup.

In this case you just make a choice to not examine the extra-textual dimensions of the Abrahamic tradition because your mind is made up on the texts.  That's a very academic approach.

Texts inform people's choices. For example, do you really think Israel would be as intense about eliminating Palestinians from Israel if they did not have a convenient narrative derived from their textual tradition? I don't. Would there even be an Israel at all unless this narrative existed to inform European guilt about permitting the holocaust? I don't think so.

Much has been said about mystics. Mystics and mysticism can be perverse, look at Himmler, etc.

I am convinced, seriously, that human beings do not act negatively the way they do without nonhuman provocations, especially when it comes to large scale events like the holocaust, the cultural revolution, the 1918 Influenza epidemic and so on. Human beings are basically decent, over all. But they can be twisted pretty easily.

The hilarious thing is that most faithful and loyal followers of HHDL will sooner go to Muslim festival of sacrifice than spend on minute with the Gyalpo folks.

You just vehemently object to my point of view. That's ok. I don't post things in order to get people to agree with me.

The fact is that these books, the OT, are not read solely by academicians. They are read mostly by ordinary people. Unlike Islam, which has a sophisticated tradition of jurisprudence, there is no such tradition for the OT in the West. Yes, the Talmud is such a text, but that is not read by your average Christian. Your average Christian will read this and take it face value.

There is nothing in our scriptures that would establish it for a fact that what Abrahamics worship is an evil spirit.

Malcolm wrote:
I did not use the word evil, spirits, being mundane creatures, are nice to their followers and not so nice to their enemies, for example, 1 Samuel 15:

treehuggingoctopus said:
1 Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.

2 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came up from Egypt.

3 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

4 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of Judah.

5 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the valley.

6 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites.

7 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest to Shur, that is over against Egypt.

8 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.

9 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed utterly.

10 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,

11 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is turned back from following me, and hath not performed my commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the LORD all night.

12 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone down to Gilgal.

13 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the LORD.

14 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?

15 And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly destroyed.

16 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say on.

17 And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight, wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the LORD anointed thee king over Israel?

18 And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them until they be consumed.

19 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the LORD?

20 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed the Amalekites.

21 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.

22 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD? Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.

23 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.

24 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words: because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.

25 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD.

26 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath rejected thee from being king over Israel.

27 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the skirt of his mantle, and it rent.

28 And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of thine, that is better than thou.

29 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for he is not a man, that he should repent.

30 Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee, before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.

31 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the LORD.

32 Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said, Surely the bitterness of death is past.

33 And Samuel said, As thy sword hath made women childless, so shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.

34 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to Gibeah of Saul.

35 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.

Malcolm wrote:
So here we have a channeler [prophet], who shows up at Saul's door, and informs him that the LORD has told him to annihilate another tribe. Samuel castigates Saul for taking plunder, rather than following the scorched earth policy the LORD has ordained. Then Samuel, just to make a point, slays Agag, a duty in which Saul has failed. And apparently, the LORD regretted his decision to make Saul the king of the Israelites.

It's one thing to say that Buddhism is the only path that leads from samsara.... and asserting that the Abrahamic religions all worship a demon Gyalpo.

It's subtle.  Just try to catch it if you can.

This back pedaling is BS.  That Malcolm "just said that these were samsaric" is nonsense.


Malcolm wrote:
The God of Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Mohammed

a) Does not exist

b) Is a mundane entity [i.e. does not exist in the way the adherents of the Abrahamic religions imagine]

There is no third choice.

Given that Judaism, Islam and Christianity are a revealed religions, [through the angel Gabriel no less, in the case if Islam], I am inclined towards b.

In Buddhadharma, we have always been comfortable with the idea that a mundane entity deceives others into believe they are the creator of the universe and so. For example:

Urgyen Dorje said:
"So the monk approached the Great Brahma and, on arrival, said, 'Friend, where do these four great elements — the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property — cease without remainder?'

"When this was said, the Great Brahma said to the monk, 'I, monk, am Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be.'

A second time, the monk said to the Great Brahma, 'Friend, I didn't ask you if you were Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. I asked you where these four great elements — the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property — cease without remainder.'

"A second time, the Great Brahma said to the monk, 'I, monk, am Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be.'

"A third time, the monk said to the Great Brahma, 'Friend, I didn't ask you if you were Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Sovereign Lord, the Maker, Creator, Chief, Appointer and Ruler, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. I asked you where these four great elements — the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, and the wind property — cease without remainder.'

"Then the Great Brahma, taking the monk by the arm and leading him off to one side, said to him, 'These gods of the retinue of Brahma believe, "There is nothing that the Great Brahma does not know. There is nothing that the Great Brahma does not see. There is nothing of which the Great Brahma is unaware. There is nothing that the Great Brahma has not realized." That is why I did not say in their presence that I, too, don't know where the four great elements... cease without remainder. So you have acted wrongly, acted incorrectly, in bypassing the Blessed One in search of an answer to this question elsewhere. Go right back to the Blessed One and, on arrival, ask him this question. However he answers it, you should take it to heart.'

A Zen story about the importance of holy books.
----------------

The Zen master Mu-nan had only one successor. His name was Shoju. After Shoju had completed his study of Zen, Mu-nan called him into his room. “I am getting old,” he said, “and as far as I know, Shoju, you are the only one who will carry on this teaching. Here is a book. It has been passed down from master to master for seven generations. I also have added many points according to my understanding. The book is very valuable, and I am giving it to you to represent your successorship.”

“If the book is such an important thing, you had better keep it,” Shoju replied. “I received your Zen without writing and am satisfied with it as it is.”

“I know that,” said Mu-nan. “Even so, this work has been carried from master to master for seven generations, so you may keep it as a symbol of having received the teaching. Here.”

The two happened to be talking before a brazier. The instant Shoju felt the book in his hands he thrust it into the flaming coals. He had no lust for possessions.

Mu-nan, who never had been angry before, yelled: “What are you doing!”

Shoju shouted back: “What are you saying!”

The fact that there is a tiny minority of dissenting vegetarian Muslims amounts to very little in the face of the 3.5 billion spent on animals in Pakistan last year, for example, for the festival of sacrifice.

Maybe better expressed by HH the Dalai Lama:
Dalai Lama: I always say that people should not rush to change religions. There is real value in finding the spiritual resources you need in your home religion. Even secular humanism has great spiritual resources; it is almost like a religion to me. All religions try to benefit people, with the same basic message of the need for love and compassion, for justice and honesty, for contentment. So merely changing formal religious affiliations will often not help much.

I have sympathy with the idea of 'perennial philosophy' - that there is a broad current or stream of wisdom which finds expression in different traditions and different times and places throughout history. But I have noticed that this view gets pretty short shrift on Dharma Wheel. That's fair enough, it is a forum that is dedicated to Buddhist dharma, and it's certainly not a place to proselytize other religions (as it says in the ToS). On the other hand the kind of attitude, that there is only one 'true way', or even that there is only one type of view within Buddhism itself, which is the 'one true way', , and the deprecation of other faiths, is a mirror-image of what you would read on a Christian forum about Buddhism. 'Our way is better than their's', is what they would be saying there. And so on.

I find that through my Buddhist practice I actually have a much better and more sympathetic insight for the spiritual meaning of the Catholic liturgy and ritual and I also sympathize with a good many Catholic writers and teachers. I don't feel I need to join up; I don't think that 'converting' to their religion is necessary. But I can feel the spirituality of that faith and admire it, without having to either embrace it or push it away.

None of that rationalises animal sacrifice, by the way. I think that ought to be opposed on all counts, but that doesn't apply to Christianity.

Actually I have been reading a bit of Thich Nath Hahn's 'Living Buddha Living Christ' and finding it very moving. I've been read a Franciscan monastic called Father Richard Rohr. I don't think he's worlds apart from the Buddhist attitude.

But the world is global village nowadays, we have to accept a plurality of views - it doesn't mean going along with every one of them, or agreeing with everyone, but I am not very fond of the 'my way or the highway' attitude either.

Someone whose karma is to be born outside of Buddhadharma, meaning that they will not meet it, does not have a precious human birth. It does not matter how nice they are, how kind they are, how compassionate they are, how spiritual they are — they do not have a precious human birth.

For them, there is no guarantee of where they will find themselves in the next world.

DGA said:
1. Malcolm's position is that the deities propitiated by practitioners of Islam, Santeria, some traditional African and Indian religions, &c are worldly spirits:  they are real, and classified as gyalpo.

Malcolm wrote:
Not necessarily gyalpos, can be klu bdud, such as one entity I encountered in South Africa through a young Sangoma couple I met there through my host [who posts here on Dharmawheel].

Really super lovely people, you would never meet any one sweeter.

But they worship this pretty bloody klu bdud entity, very ferocious. Did they kill some chickens in the course of our meeting. Yes. Did they feed those chickens to the river to satisfy this spirit? Yes. Did we try to create a positive connection with the Dharma for everyone there? Yes. Did we succeed? I hope so.

So do they, as Sangoma, regularly sacrifice cows, goats, etc.? Yes. It is all part of their tradition, it is how they do things there. It is, in my opinion, one of the things that makes Africa so screwed up. Not because the people are bad, evil and so on, but because the practice of sacrificing animals feeds very powerful worldly spirits through life force and intention, and those spirits are angry, jealous, competitive, etc.

To their credit, the Sangoma couple were super interested in learning Song of the Vajra. I think eventually they got a hold of a CD. I don't know anything more than that. I hope someday we here something like a Sounds of Soweto version — that would be awesome.

We were the first white people they ever met who took them seriously as people. They were completely thrilled to host us, and we took everything in stride. I really liked them. They are fantastic people.

A footnote, when it came time for them to sacrifice the chickens, the lead Sangoma, dressed in his finest, tried to show me respect by offering to have me kill the first chicken. I politely refused, saying, this is not part of my tradition. He did not mind, and dispatched those chickens efficiently, tossing them into the river. They were a little sad we could not hang around and cook them and eat them, that is why they tossed the chickens in the river. Some people might say, "How horrible! How come you did not try to save the chickens?" Those chickens were destined to die, if not that day, the next, or the next. Nothing we could do would have saved them.

So you folks have the wrong idea about my point of view. I have seen first hand experience with these kinds of traditions. I don't judge the people who engage in them, I judge the practices themselves.

For example, when I first met ChNN in 1992, he was making fun of people who want to become Shamans, because in reality, to become a Real Shaman™, you have to sacrifice some animals as part of the initiation [in this case, three sheep], based on his experience in Mongolia, visiting Real Shaman™. He was pointing out that if you want to become a shaman, this is what you have to do, and that this contradicted the principles of Dzogchen teachings.

DGA said:
He sees hypocrisy in those Buddhists who denounce gyalpo worship among some other Buddhists, but tend not to do so with regard to those who are, from his perspective, gyalpo worshippers--Muslims particularly but not exclusively.

This is something my own Tibetan Buddhist teachers have articulated as well.  While they would not suggest that Abrahamic practitioners were on dharma paths, they have also said not to disparage them.  As one of my teachers said, and this is a quote, "some of them are on a path close to yours, closer than you know."   This may sound strange, but the term for "buddhist", nangpa, simply means "insider", one directed towards inner process, inner spirituality, as opposed to outer forms-- such as worshipping gods and the like.  We're not the only one's turned inwards.  We may not be turned to the same place, and thus not all on dharma paths, but others are turned inwards as well.

Malcolm wrote:
Pointing out that the deities of other religions are samsaric is not disparaging them. It is stating simply that those paths do not lead to nirvana [cessation of afflictions]. They have a different goal in mind, if they even have a goal [there are plenty of religious expressions, such as Purva Mimamsa, that do not even believe in the concept of liberation, mukti.]

People who are not fortunate, those who have not met the teachings, are objects of compassion. This does not prevent us, however, from analyzing and understanding their mistakes and how the views they espouse shroud them in darkness.

For example, the Rig pa rang shar tantra runs through 60 incorrect views. The Brahmajala sutta runs through a different set of 62 incorrect views.

The point is not to castigate people who follow those views, the point is to understand that those views exist and that they are not conducive to liberation.

Malcolm...

Thanks for the clarifications of your points.  It's not clear what people's intentions are sometimes in the "fog of the internet forum", especially when people are debating multiple points asynchronously.

Points where I agree with you...

I would agree that there is much about the Abrahamic religions that would lead to the provocation of gyalpos, such as the murder of Christ and Ali ibn Abi Talib and various martyred saints.  I would agree that these gyalpo uprisings lead to any number of problems for these cultural areas over time.  History seems to illustrate that.  And seeing ChNNR as one of my own teachers, though by webcast only, I respect thoughts on relating gyalpo uprisings to problems in the middle east.   I would agree that it is problematic that we're not engaged in practices to pacify these influences.   I would also agree that any number of practices in the Abrahamic traditions would lead to various disturbances, such as animal sacrifices.  I would agree that these are scourges to our world and that there is no way Buddhists should engage in them, encourage them, or defend them.  And I would agree that none of these Abrahamic religions are dharma paths, and should not be defended as such as by Buddhists.

Points where I disagree with you...

While I would disagree that none of these Abrahamic religions are dharma paths, I do not accept that they are necessarily "worldly religions".  As I have been taught uniformly by my teachers, the non-Buddhist paths include "non-worldly" and "worldly" paths. The "worldly paths" are those that are not based on love and compassion for beings, which rationalize harming beings as virtue, and which rejoice in negative qualities.  I would assert that the Abrahamic religions have produced both worldly and non-worldly non-dharma paths. Note: I am not sure that you and I are using the terms "worldly" and "non-worldly" the same way.  You seem to use it in the context of any path that is non-Buddhist.  For a lack of other terms, I am following my teachers (or their translators rather) and using the terms as I have indicated here.

I would disagree that we can make broad generalizations about the theology and worldview of the Abrahamic traditions.  Given the geographical and historical context of the Abrahamic religions, there are too many spiritual and intellectual influences, too many local ideosyncratic expressions, and too many radical changes in theory and practice to summarize them as you have.  I would agree that there are people in the Abrahamic tradition who are certainly propitiating a gyalpo as they slit animals throats or kill and/or mutilate people.  I disagree that can be generalized.  Several examples such as Kabbalah, Druze, Sufism, etc. can be made, and while we can argue that these traditions actually have their roots in Buddhism or Neoplatonism-- these people certainly identify as being part of the Abrahamic tradition. There are people who embrace a "theology" that is hardly theological at all.  In those cases deity is more an ethical impulse than something of a master or lord.

So...

To reiterate my own position... I don't consider people who embrace a "worldly path" (as I've defined above) as practitioners of any religion.  So when I "defend Islam" what I'm defending are people who are on a non-worldly path.  I defend and support anyone on a non-worldly path.  I don't think there's anything in the dharma that prohibits associating with and supporting people on positive non-worldly non-Buddhist paths-- though there are certainly prohibitions against associating with and supporting those who follow worldly paths.

I guess the question is how do you know?  That is the question, and I don't think it's answered by gross generalizations, but by experience.  We know by people's qualities and actions.  It's madness to me to attempt to equate the spirituality of a snake handling church pastor in the Appalachians with Julian of Norwich, just as it is to equate a Talibani ordering a woman stoned with Ra'abia.

Yes.  That narrows the pool down.  But I'd much rather associate with Christian contemplatives and Sufis who have really amazing qualities that really unkind and self-absorbed Buddhists and similarly narcissistic materialists.

Malcolm wrote:
It is very simple.

There are basically two paths: samsaric and nirvanic.

Samsaric paths have a number different kinds of paths: eternalist, annihilationist, incorrect conduct [like impaling yourself with weapons], wrong paths and so on.

Nirvanic paths refer to the nine yānas beginning with the śravakayāna.

When I say worldly, I mean samsaric.

Thanks Malcolm, but I can parse my own posts. I did not label the US government a "terrorist organization". I said it has committed terrorist acts with examples which satisfy the commonly accepted definition of terrorism:
Violent acts (or the threat of violent acts) intended to create fear (terror), perpetrated for an economic, religious, political, or ideological goal, and which deliberately target or disregard the safety of non-combatants (e.g., neutral military personnel or civilians).

Malcolm wrote:
Then the US Government military actions in general do not correspond with this. The whole point of US Military policy since Vietnam has been to avoid as much as possible harming noncombatants. Successfully? No. But US Military has very strict rules of engagement, and the consequences of breaking them as landed many soldiers in jail for murder.

Are those rules always effective? Hell no, just look at that video of those poor journalists who were shot in Iraq, the video that landed Manning in jail. Do people get hurt unnecessarily in war? Always. War is hell and should always be avoided. But that is not the world we are living in.

As for Dresden, it was a legitimate target. The Dresden bombing as to serve two main purposes: to eliminate the very many factories in that city supporting the German war effort, including a chemical weapons plant, and to show the Russians the full power of the Allied forces.

The problem with Dresden is that they bombed the city center, rather than the suburbs [more than half of the bombers sent bombed other cities by mistake, including Prague], where most of the targeted factories were located. A journalist labelled it a terror bombing, and then the political spin began...

A tragedy, yes, a deliberate act of terror on the part of the Allies? No.

Hiroshima and Nagasaki, again tragic, but not terrorism. Folly, yes. Terrorism, no.

OK, couple of points here.

The KKK is/was a terrorist organization.  So was Posse Comitatus.  So were the thugs who killed Mulugeta Seraw on the streets of my hometown:  "East Side White Pride."  There's a longstanding tradition of terrorism in the US--terrorism specifically against blacks and Native Americans, but not exclusively.  Lynchings are terrorist acts, and were at one time a regular spectacle across much of the country (and not only in the South...).  So while it's true that the federal government does not endorse or mobilize terrorism against any US population, it's still in the repertoire, so to speak.  And that's not even counting terrorists of the Tim McVeigh variety.

Some Americans now are sympathetic to acts of terror against other Americans.  You can take my word for it, or you can go spend a minute at Stormfront, if you can last that long before puking on your machine.  Some Americans act on those sympathies and impulses.  I present Dylann Roof, terrorist, as an example here.

I don't bring this up because I'm ashamed of American history or culture.  I really like living here; there's a lot to love about the United States.  There's also a lot to be repelled by and to seek to change and heal.  That's the side I prefer to take.  But to do that, it's important to face the ugly truth and to view the present moment with a gimlet eye from time to time.  Jameson was right:  "history is what hurts"  it's another word for "samsara"

Meanwhile, the world sits on its ass as another real terrorist organization sets its sights on Turkey.

Anyway, this thread has spun way off topic, from "Tolerance of other religions" to "Demonizing America as the Great Satan."

It's not a question of what I believe. It's a question of making unfalsifiable claims on a public forum that depend solely on your devotion to a guru.

I find your approach to this a little confusing, and I suspect it reflects more of a personal bias on your part, than your methodology.

For example, over in the Forbidden Archaeology thread, you're asserting that we can't approach texts in a materialistic context, while ignoring the living tradition.  As such, the academic's assertion that the abhidharmic cosmology is flawed and represents a flaw world-view really does not apply, as there are many meanings to those texts and many meanings of cosmology itself.  And thus, if we approach these texts through the living tradition, we understand that there is cosmology re locations of mountains and oceans and cosmology re representations of merit.

Malcolm wrote:
I am not asserting that. I am asserting that Indrajala's method is materialistic in nature. I have not made any claims at all there apart from pointing out that there are several Buddhist cosmologies and that therefore, they are not definitive.

It seems if we're going to use post-structuralist approaches to Buddhist texts to appreciate their polyvalency and pliancy in the context of their cultural and historical expressions, along with the living traditions that go along with them-- then we need to afford the Abrahamic texts the same method.

If you want to say that a bunch of dark shit associated with the Abrahamic tradition was either caused by gyalpos or evoked gyalpos-- I'm with you.

Why? Gyalpos don't have a form.

Not only that, I already addressed this issue by pointing out that Kabbalah is basically neo-Platonism, etc. There is a strong tradition of Hellenistic philosophy that runs through all Western and Near-Eastern Philosophy and mysticism. As far as Sufism goes, there are arguments on both sides of the issues — some scholars contend that due to the rise of Sufism in the Persian world, there is a strong element of Buddhist undercurrent within it; others reject this and site the rise of Sufism in the Islamic experience itself. But these things do not matter very much. They are not germaine to the main point I am making. Every religion has its Pālas, its protectors. In Tibet for example, bTsan, Gyalpos, and the like, such as Thang lha, Ma chen Pomra, etc. were moved from the position of being the object of worship to being bound into oath as protectors.

The central god of the Abrahamic tradition, by definition a worldly being, has never been bound to an oath. He is part of the eight classes, one of the dregs pa sde brgyad.

The vast atrocities of Cortez, Genghis Khan, etc., the unknown millions who died in the An Lushan Rebellion in the mid 8th century, all of these things can be laid at the feet of human beings whose minds are deranged by provocations.

Most people do not give the eight classes the kind of credit they deserve for causing havoc among humans.

So let's apply our analysis and methods uniformly, and let's be clear what are and are not religious paths.

Malcolm wrote:
There are three kinds of religious paths: Saddharma, Lokadharma and Mithyadharma. Buddha's Dharma is Saddharma. Everything else is either a Lokadharma or a Mithyadharma, and is usually a mixture of both.

For example, you might ask, well, what about Jesus? Jesus was a human being, a man. He was not a spirit, or some kind of provocation. But in reality, it is exactly the kind of death he suffered that gives rise to Gyalpos. Gyalpos arise when people with powerful spiritual charisma, etc. are murdered.

The Christian pantheon is filled with martyrs who also can have exactly that kind of rebirth, as powerful avenging spirits. Then there are more benevolent protectors, we like to call them "saints."

Gyalpos, etc. function best when they are not recognized as such.

Since no one believes in them any more, very little is done to quell their actions, and as a result we live in the kind of world we do.

Samsara has been a mess since forever. It's not all or even mostly caused by gyalpos. The beings that are born into areas of strife quite obviously are habituated strongly to afflictive emotions.
Yes, and that includes being born into areas of strife where that strife is largely a result of non-human provocation. For example, Padmasambava explains our times perfectly to Nyang Tingzing Zangpo:
Taking life, deceptive trade practices, are each poisonous supports. Competing in skill at theft and plunder, teachers who take the life of virtue are made into one’s mother. “Father” is not heard by children, “master” is not heard by servants, “lord” is not heard by subjects. The wicked are in full bloom. Ornaments are made into weapons. Dharma activities shorten one’s life, but misdeeds raise one’s spirits. The temples fall into disrepair. Since the negative local spirits spread, there is much frost and hail. Mamos and dākinīs spread contagious diseases among children, adult diseases for adults, cattle diseases for cattle, and blights on harvests, etc., will appear suddenly like dust devils. Tree wither above the roots, generations are destroyed by famine. Rats invade the land.

At that time, there are no Dharma activities, and since misdeeds increase, cause and result is ignored. Because of the power of the ten misdeeds, etc., the merit of Tibet sinks lower and lower.

Pehar possess monks, only a few men possess vows. Since demons and spirits possess mantra practitioners, commitments do not exist and illness increase. Since Gyalpos possess men, they start civil wars. Since Srinmo possess women, they commit adultery, administer poisons and are deceptive. Since The'u rang possess children, they steal, have fevers, and are badly behaved. There are many madmen and rabid dogs. Since the food portions of sentient beings diminish, the essence of their elements is harmed. Efforts will be made to reach the top of the Himalayas and there will be farming on the mountains.
This is a description of our era.

The reason we have these oracles is because these are worldly entities that are able to take control of trained mediums [sku brten] and communicate with us directly.

But conventionally, spirits, non-humans beings, like nāgas, devas, pretas [this is actually what "spirits" are], gandharvas, yakṣas, dakas, dakinīs, unmadas, apasmaras, kumbhadhas etc., all exist. Some of them are on our side, some are not, as this sutta points out:

Tsongkhapafan said:
"If any monk or nun, layman or laywoman learns by heart this Atanata protection, and be word-perfect in repeating it, and if any non-human male or female Yakkha, youth or maiden Yakkha, Yakkha Minister or any Yakkha, or Yakkha attendant; male or female Gandhabba... (as before); male or female Kumbhanda... male or female Naga... were to walk with him or her, or stand or sit or lie down with him or her with malevolent intent, such a non-human, Happy One, will not obtain hospitality from any town or township, will not obtain a place to dwell, nor could live in the Kingdom of Alakamanda. He will not be able to attend the meetings of the Yakkhas. Further he would not be accepted or given in marriage, he would be reproached (by casting remarks on his deformed teeth or eyes or any part of the body), and the non-humans would put an empty bowl over his head and split it (head) in seven pieces.

"Happy One, there are non-humans who are fierce, violent, given to retaliation; those non-humans heed neither the (four) great kings, nor their ministers nor their attendants. They are called rebels against the (four) great kings. Even as in the kingdom of Magadha, the thieves heed neither the king of Magadha, nor the ministers, nor their attendants, and are called rebels against the king of Magadha, so there are non-humans who are fierce... (as before). They are called rebels against the (four) great kings.

The issue here as I see it is that the line gets quite grey.

Native Americans for instance have plenty of "ritual killing" under this definition, but it is also simply a part (or was, still is for some who choose) a part of obtaining food. It is the same with Kosher laws, unless you believe everyone would be vegetarian (and actually, it is easy to argue that Kosher laws actually encourage vegetarianism) without following kosher laws, then there is little difference between eating Kosher foods or non-Kosher..since it is not something done to obtain a favorable result.

Random trivia:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapparot

"[...] Jewish atonement ritual practiced by some Jews on the eve of Yom Kippur. "

" On the afternoon before Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement of the world, one prepares an item to be donated to the poor for consumption at the pre-Yom Kippur meal.,[2] recites the two biblical passages of Psalms 107:17-20 and Job 33:23-24, and then swings the prepared charitable donation over one's head three times while reciting a short prayer three times.

the prayer recited translates as:

This is my exchange, this is my substitute, this is my atonement. This rooster (hen) will go to its death, while I will enter and proceed to a good long life and to peace. "

" The ritual appealed especially to Kabbalists "
In the United States, the Kapparot ritual would seem to be constitutionally protected as an exercise of freedom of religion, based upon a 1993 U.S. Supreme Court decision in the case of Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye v. City of Hialeah. In that case, the court upheld the right of Santeria adherents to practice ritual animal sacrifice, with Justice Anthony Kennedy stating in the decision, "religious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, consistent or comprehensible to others in order to merit First Amendment protection". (quoted by Justice Kennedy from the opinion by Justice Warren E. Burger in Thomas v. Review Board of the Indiana Employment Security Division 450 U.S. 707 (1981))
The mass-slaughter of chickens on the day of high demand by a Shochet (licensed and trained "butcher"), repeatedly results in a certain percentage of chicken not slaughtered according to shechita due to haste, fatigue, imperfection and non-reviewed uncertainty. Furthermore, chicken of kapparot may not be accepted even by the poor, because they are commonly perceived as being quasi-accurst (cursed) after the ritual.
Sad.

I have never made any kind of claim that resembles this. You are tilting windmills. I have only referred to different cosmologies in order to point out that they are not fixed frames of reference in pan-Buddhist doctrine. The cosmology of the Avatamsaka or the Realms and Transformations of Sound Tantra [ sgra thal gyur ] in no way resembles the cosmology of the Kosha.

One of the key features of the Carvaka school is that they reject all authorities other than direct perception.

The consequence of the methodology advocated by you is largely the same. Ergo, whether you intend it to be or not, your methodology is rooted in the western tradition of logical positivism, it is therefore materialist, even if you are not in terms of your personal beliefs a materialist or a physicalist.

"Evidence-based" is a nice catch phrase, for example, it is used in medicine quite a bit these days too, given that medicine is the origin of the term. To give you an example of the problem:

Indrajala said:
Evidence-based medicine is controversial not because people disagree about whether medical decisions ought to incorporate the best available evidence, but because they disagree about how narrowly evidence should be defined.14 Neither advocates nor opponents of evidence-based medicine consistently differentiate between the everyday meaning of evidence and the evidence of evidence-based medicine that refers only to the results of particular types of research.12,15 This persistent confusion makes the label evidence-based medicine divisive, and authors on both sides of the debate have suggested that it be discarded or replaced.

I haven't looked at the Kalacakra in any great detail, but I've read his work on the matter.

I think the simplest explanation is that mathematical astronomy or something based on it, all originally meant for a spherical earth, had to be accounted for given its universal applicability and accuracy, in a flat earth Mt. Meru cosmology. By the 11th century presumably such knowledge was readily accessible and thus anyone with an interest in astrology and astronomy would have been aware of the requisite math involved.

I'm throwing myself in the fire here... but here it goes...

The reality of the situation is that new forms of Tibetan Buddhism are forming within PRC from a combination of Beijing's policies against traditional Tibetan Buddhism and the rise of a Chinese middle class with an interest and need for spiritual things, and money to spend on it, not to mention Tibetans floating in cultural and religious limbo as China destroys their culture.  Of course these "new forms" aren't related to the "old forms" that traditional Tibetan Buddhists would relate to and consider legitimate, but from an anthropological vantage point, they're every bit as legitimate as the old forms that have unbroken lineages.

From my side, this is sort of important to keep in mind.  Of course China identifying and promoting a fake Panchen Lama is a political stunt and a tactic to destabilize the seat of the Dalai Lama, and thus Tibetan Buddhism as a whole.  And of course people are intimidated into recognizing this fake Panchen Lama.  And of course it is an illegitimate lineage.  At the same time, there are certainly people who relate to him in a way that they would consider genuine.

This goes for a whole spectrum of other nontraditional forms of Buddhism created by opportunists, some of them more spiritually genuine than others, some more predatory than others.

The only reason I bring this up is that it's a difficult set of fault lines.  As one directly attacks Beijing's fake Panchen lama, one is fighting for the legitimacy of his lineage and indirectly of that of the Dalai Lama, and thus for all of traditional Tibetan Buddhism.  At the same time, one is fighting against what at least some people consider to be legitimate.

This might seem like a moot point, but look at all the fake lamas that people have legitimized in the West.  NKT.  Geshe Michael Roach.  People are willing to go down with the ship for these things, and I suspect that's the ase in China as well.  At least that's what I'm told by people who did Buddhist ethnography over there.

No, it doesn't work like this. It simply says if there is no evidence, then you cannot make anything more than speculative claims. Even if evidence is available, one has to ask how credible and reliable it is.

I'm quite willing to accept he had this experience (meeting spirits or gods in the wilderness is a common experience around the world), but if he reported details of what the Buddha said based on the testimonies of these goddesses he encountered, how would I be able to gauge or evaluate these new accounts?

Our attempts to understand the pre-7th century culture of Tibet and Zhang Zhung can only be mined from Bon and Buddhist sources that are quite late, and pretty much everyone agrees that we can only make broad conjectures based on systematic themes found [mainly] in Bon literature [which is very understudied and poorly understood in the West] which clearly differentiates native Tibetan cultural patterns and practices from imported Indian, as well as Chinese, patterns.

But if we accept your methodology, we can say nothing of this culture prior to its being noticed by Tang Chinese bureaucrats and Arab generals. But obviously there was a culture there, and a people, and so on.

Indrajala said:
If your goal is liberation from saṃsāra, then maybe not so much, but then you might have to ask the question what did saṃsāra originally mean and how did it change over time, and what did it come to mean to different Buddhist thinkers?

As one example, what is the relationship of saṃsāra to astrology? Originally Buddhists rejected astrology and said it was basically inappropriate nonsense, but that changed over time (a parallel development can be traced in India), and by the sixth century you see the suggestion that astrology is in fact quite important and knowledge of it is necessary for liberation. This is even more evident in Tantric traditions in which rites have to be performed according to an astrological schedule.

However, these points have little bearing on an evidence-based analysis of history run through the gauntlet of precise philology. Buddhist history can be charted out according to a chronology that corresponds well with other parallel developments in the world, like rise and fall of the Mauryas and Kushanas, or the introduction of Hellenistic elements into Indian civilization. That means linear time and cause followed by effect. This analysis has its limits, but it works and yields good results.

The Pellucid Transcendent State of Samantabhadra asserts that buddhahood cannot be obtained through gathering accumulations and purifying obscurations caused by samsaric impediments. 

If one wishes to attain buddhahood, three recognitions are necessary. Those are: the result does not arise from a cause, buddhahood does not arise from the mind and the intimate instruction does not arise from scripture. 

Furthermore, all buddhas do not attain buddhahood gradually, but attain buddhahood instantly. If recognized in the morning, there is buddhahood in the morning. If recognized in the evening, there is buddhahood in the evening. Vajrasattva said:

Buddhahood is not attained through purification [sangs].
Through recognizing the three kinds of self-origination,
pristine consciousness expands [rgyas] from vidyā.

Stupid question time, though. The term 'state' is used often in English language Dzogchen literature, especially in the DC.

I'm not a scholar, but here's a quote from Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche's "As It Is, Vol. I": By training thoroughly in this way, discursive thinking will gradually grow less and less, and moments of thoughtfree wakefulness will grow longer and longer. When this nonconceptual wakefulness lasts one hour, you have attained the level of an arhat. When it lasts throughout the day, you have attained the level of a bodhisattva. When it is uninterrupted day and night, you have become a fully enlightened buddha. There is nothing more precious than this.

zenman said:
Interesting quote, especially because it mentions the requirement of an arhat which is hinayana directly compared to mahayana- and vajrayana-attainments. I understand Tulku Urgyen was a great master but I wonder if this is actually so. This is in fact what I was after with my former question reg. 24/7 awareness vs. fully enlightened buddhahood. I have come across a few people who say that their awareness is uninterrupted day and night and has been for many years. And it seemed to me that it might actually be so without any "specialty" or egoism to them. I thought 24/7 was what arhats are in. I think this is a wonderful degree of attainment but surely anyone I have met saying this can't stick their hand into fire without getting hurt. That's why I was asking Malcolm for the quote, to get a reliable source or sources on this exact issue.

Malcolm wrote:
Everyone's awareness is 24/7/365 for eons and eons. But not everyone's knowledge of their primordial state is 24/7/365. Those whose knowledge of their primordial state is 24/7/365 are Buddhas.

steve_bakr said:
Keep us posted on your forthcoming book. I hope it is available in Kindle format.

Malcolm wrote:
At this point, we are not doing an electronic edition.

The very short explanation is, according to the upadesha class tantras such as the root tantra of Dzogchen, sgra thal gyur, that there is a neutral awareness [ shes pa ] that arises out of the basis because of a stirring of vāyu [ rlung ], sometimes mistranslated as prāṇa ( prāṇa is a vāyu ). Because there is a movement, accompanied by sound [ sgra ], lights [ 'od ] and rays [ zer ]*, there are appearances that arise out of the basis. When these appearances are recognized as one's own state, this recognition is what is called " rig pa ", it is also given the name " shes rab " or prājña. When these appearances are not recognized as one's own state, this is called " ma rig pa ", avidyā.

It is for this reason, for example, that the famous Aspiration of Buddha Samantabhadra begins:
All of the universe and beings, samsara and nirvana
have one basis. The two paths and two results
are the enchantments of knowledge [rig pa] and ignorance [ma rig pa].
The two paths are the path to buddhahood, which is based on rig pa; and the path of the six realms which is based on ma rig pa.

Futher, we can see that vidyā, rig pa comes from the basis, but it is not the basis:
Vidyā self-originates from that basis itself
without bearing the faults of external and internal reification,
free from the tainted darkness of amnesia,
therefore, it self-appears unaffected by faults.
Rig pa self originates from the basis because rig pa is just the recognition of the basis as one's own state itself. It self-originates because you did not receive this knowledge from someone else, you must recognize it in a direct perception called the direct perception of dharmatā, your real nature. The so-called "direct introduction" is mere a method to introduce you to "your own face." This is one reason why the metaphor of the mirror is so important in Dzogchen teachings. This rig pa, this true knowledge of one's own state, is therefore unaffected by subject and object dualism; is free from non-recollection, because once you have this unmistaken knowledge, i.e., vidyā, you will never forget it, and therefore, vidyā is unaffected by any faults whatsoever.

However western translators may translate these terms, what they mean in Tibetan is very precise, and between Chos and Bon, have exactly the same meaning.

You can see again in this following passage that shes pa, awareness, and knowledge, rig pa, vidyā, are used in two different ways:
One’s vidyā [rig pa, knowledge of the basis] abides in a pristine state,
not terrified by the terrors of the three realms,
not attached to sensuous qualities. 
Physical form and color do not exist
in self-originated nonconceptual awareness [shes pa].
One's vidya, rigpa, knowledge, abides in a pristine state because there are no physical forms and colors in consciousness; rig pa is the knowledge that the appearances of the five lights and so on in one's fundamental unfabricated consciousness are not substantial or real. They are merely the energy of the basis, from which that awareness is inseparable.

When this knowledge does not arise, then as the Aspiration of Samantbhadra states:
First, since vidyā/rig pa did not arise in the basis 
deluded sentient beings
cannot recall anything and are confused.
The cause of that is the delusion of ignorance.
Within that is a sudden unconsciousness
in which a fearful awareness stirs without clarity, 
Within that self and other are perceived as enemies. 
From the gradual buildup of traces, 
entry into the process of samsara happens.
If vidyā is the basis, then there is no way anyone could ever be deluded, samsara would never have happened. Indeed, there is popular strand of misconception in Dzogchen that claims that samsara never did happen. While this is true from the point of view of Samantabhadra [and hence the rhetoric of the sems sde literature], this is not true from our point of view, since we are continuing in samsara and gather karma and building up traces. If we are in the state of knowledge that is the state of Samantabhadra, then for us samsara will gave never happened. But until we are in that knowledge 24/7/365 and therefore totally beyond time, then we are still in samsara.

Since vidyā is not the basis, by mistaking the nature of the sounds, lights and rays that come from the basis for being dualistic phenomena, one is trapped by avidyā, ma rig pa and one cycles endlessly in the three realms. Dzogchen practice is the means the reverse this error because the basis of knowledge and ignorance is the same, and knowledge and ignorance arise on the basis of an awareness [shes pa] that exists as part of the basis.

My book expends a little energy in explaining these critical points in an introduction, but my explanation is not novel nor is it my own. I merely follow an outline that is common in both Chos and Bon Dzogchen teachings, and I use many citations from untranslated commentaries of Vimalamitra on the 17 Dzogchen tantras to illustrate my points. The only novel thing in my explanation is that I show the link between the initial shes pa, awareness or fundamental consciousness that arises from the basis, how that becomes pristine consciousness [ ye shes ] when in the presence of rig pa or knowledge of its own state; and how it becomes yid kyi rnam shes or "mental consciousness" and mind [ sems ] when it does not recognize its own state and engages in the dualistic imputations of because of ignorance [ ma rig pa ]. But even here, I do so on the basis of citations and reasonings drawn from classic commentaries, and I cannot claim any of these ideas as novel or as being my own.

Title: The Point of No Return: Climate Change Nightmares Are Alread

Evidence for the above scenario comes in large part from our best understanding of what happened 250 million years ago, during the "Great Dying," when more than 90 percent of all oceanic species perished after a pulse of carbon dioxide and methane from land-based sources began a period of profound climate change. The conditions that triggered "Great Dying" took hundreds of thousands of years to develop. But humans have been emitting carbon dioxide at a much quicker rate, so the current mass extinction only took 100 years or so to kick-start.

With all these stressors working against it, a hypoxic feedback loop could wind up destroying some of the oceans' most species-rich ecosystems within our lifetime. A recent study by Sarah Moffitt of the University of California-Davis said it could take the ocean thousands of years to recover. "Looking forward for my kid, people in the future are not going to have the same ocean that I have today," Moffitt said.

Please, don't forget that the interpretations of Rigpa can be:
According Lopon Tenzin Namdak Rinpoche: "Awareness". So in Bon it seems to be that we have a different interpretation of Rigpa.

We have discussed this before, and this state of affairs is mainly due to the influence of western translators on Tibetan Lamas, not the other way around.

Rig pa and the gzhi are not identical. Why? Because if they were, the gzhi would never mistaken for an external object. It is because one is ignorant [ma rig pa] of the gzhi that samsara happens.

When you read my forthcoming book, you will then understand how it is that rig pa neither the nature of the mind, nor the gzhi.

I would say that the description of Rigpa as "knowledge" is too narrow and limited as applied to Dzogchen. It might be more accurate to describe Rigpa as "cognizance" but there is much more to it. It is not enough to go with a definition from a Tibetan dictionary. You must draw from original Dzogchen texts to appreciate the depth of Rigpa in Dzogchen.

Malcolm wrote:
Do you know Tibetan? If not, how can you say you are drawing on original Dzogchen texts?

A translator cannot rely on a dictionary meaning for Rigpa.

Malcolm wrote:
Indeed, they must able to read actual original Dzogchen texts, there are but a handful of people who can do that, and they do not all do it well.

steve_bakr said:
One must be intimately familiar with original Dzogchen texts and the quintessential masters. I would be very dubious of a teacher who described Rigpa merely as "knowledge," and who did not give to Rigpa its quintessential and pivitol place in his Dzogchen teachings.

Malcolm wrote:
Rig pa fundamentally means "knowledge of the basis." Rig pa is not the nature of the mind. The basis is the nature of the mind. This is a point that Chogyal Namkhai Norbu stresses again and again. Of course, if you are a follower of Jaxchen, well, then...

The description of Rigpa as nature of mind occurs in the works, "Natural Perfection: Longchenpa's Radical Dzogchen," "Original Perfection: Vairotsana's Five Early Transmissions," "Self-Liberation Through Seeing With Naked Awareness" (Padmasambhava), and elsewhere.

The term rig pa is not used in the five early lungs translated by Vairocana, anywhere.

You have not cited a text, you have merely mentioned some texts. A citation means producing the passage in question.

Malcolm: The "Old Tibetan Chronicles" is a fairly mythic account of the founding of the Tibetan Empire. What you seem to be referring to are the "Old Tibetan Annals", a year-by-year, fairly bare-bones account of what the court was up to. And, by the way, there is lots of external evidence against which Chinese testimony for the period can be and has been checked. Again, we cannot say that Buddhism was mostly Chinese until 780, and leave it at that, because (among other reasons)much of the remaining temple art from the very earliest temples reflects Central Asian and Kashmiri rather than Chinese styles.

Malcolm wrote:
http://otdo.aa.tufs.ac.jp/index.cgi?page=History.

Buddhism went through three phases in Tibet: the earliest period which began in the reign of Srongtsan Gampo. Buddhism was suppressed following his death; and revived again during the reign of Me Agtsom, with largely Chinese influences at the court.

A contingent of Khotanese monks indeed fled to Tibet in 740, but shortly thereafter left for Gandhara following a small pox epidemic.

Later, during the reign of Trisong Detsen, Tibet dominated all of Central Asia, Kashimir, Gilgit and so on. It is not surprising then that Tibetans have art and stylistic influences from Khotan, also they invaded it and controlled it, and we know that the monastic hierarchy of Tibetan monasteries was derived form Central Asia.

Still, epigraphically, there is very little mention of an intellectual presence of Central Asian monks. It seems, when you read Tibetan historical works on the period, the dominant external Buddhist influences were Chinese and Indian, with Indian Buddhism eventually supplanting Chinese Buddhism.

tingdzin said:
IMO, it is also already a major mistaken assumption to believe that whatever Buddhism did exist on the plateau from 600 - 900 was the same as that which arose after the period of fragmentation, although this is a topic too big for chat rooms.

Agreed.

No, I mean Tibetans.

Look, the Old Tibetan Chronicles are contemporary court records of the kind of you find in China, with corroboration of the kind you invoked from non-court sources.


Indrajala said:
No, it wasn't so simplistic as this. I'm not really convinced one could argue that Tibetan Buddhism in the Yarlung period was ignored simply because the Chinese were at odds with the Yarlung Empre.

Malcolm wrote:
Everyone knows that during the time of Trisong Desten, there were only 7 ordained Buddhist monks of Tibetan origin in Tibet. But there were Chinese Monks, Khotanese Monks etc., there as well. We also know that the court Buddhism of Tibet was largely Chinese until the 1780's, when, for various reasons, the winds changed and Tibetans decided to throw in their lot with the Indians.



Indrajala said:
Koguryo, you will remember, was an enemy state and conquered by the Chinese-Silla alliance in the 660s, yet they recognized the fact they had a big Buddhist institution there.

Malcolm wrote:
You are forgetting that Buddhism spread into that region by sea, mainly.

There was not much in Tibet that anyone wanted, and what they wanted [gold and salt] was brought down by Tibetans to trade for things in China [tea, silk] and India [spices].

As for Tibetan Ministers, well, they were soldiers; and even in the time of the 5th Dalai Lama, there were certain kinds of animal sacrifices done in Lhasa. This does not mean that the population as a whole were not interested in Dharma.
Okay, but it still understandably raises doubts about how deep the Buddhism went in the period in question.

Malcolm wrote:
It apparently went really deep...just look at Tibet today...what more evidence do you need

Dzogchen is the most direct (24/7) of all paths. It is nonconceptual Intrinsic Awareness. .

Malcolm wrote:
To what is this awareness intrinsic?

The term rang gi rig pa means "own's own vidyā", one's own knowledge."

It is used this way again and again in hundreds of Dzogchen texts written in Tibetan. Some western translators got a hold of the term, and with no justification whatsoever, decided that the " rang gi " meant "intrinsic", and " rig pa " meant "awareness." Now, rig pa can, in certain contexts, be translated as awareness, but not universally, and not in this context.

Rig pa, vidyā, knowledge, is paired against ma rig pa, avidyā, ignorance. Knowledge or ignorance of what? One's own nature, the basis, essence, nature and compassion/energy.

I am a tiny bit uncomfortable here with the word "consciousness" out of the fear of introducing subcategories such as "subconscious" or "unconscious." Honestly, the other poster is correct in prefering "awareness" to "consciousness" because all the Dzogchen literature and texts that I have seen use "awareness," specifically "Intrinsic Awareness." The word "intrinsic" signifies that awareness is intrinsic to mind; that is, awareness is the nature of mind.

Malcolm wrote:
This is because of the allergy people have to the word "consciousness", it is not a justifiable translation based on the term "consciousness" by itself.

There are a range of words in Tibetan that use the particle "shes pa" such as rnam shes, ye shes, shes rab, shes pa itself, and so on. They all refer to modes of consciousness. Rig pa refers to what that consciousness knows. Pristine consciousness [ ye shes ] is one thing, our ordinary state of consciousness [ rnam shes ] something else — but they both have the same basis, shes pa.

Dzogchen terminology for these things is a very sophisticated psychology of delusion and liberation, but unfortunately, it has been obscured by translations that are not precise and clear.

Again, so far as I can tell though there's nothing saying the Chinese noticed a significant (or any) Buddhist presence in Tibet in the Yarlung period. Later medieval historians can say what they want about this period, but questions will remain. Compare that with the Chinese accounts of places like Kucha, Khotan, Samarkand, Koguryo, Japan and SE Asian nations where popular devotion to Buddhism is noted.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, China is not the navel of the world.

Your argument runs as follows, "The Chinese did write about it, therefore it did not exist."

Tibet was of interest to China solely because Tibetans threatened their interests on the Silk Road. Other than that, China had no interest in the Tibetans, this, more than anything else, explains the lack of mention of Tibetan in Chinese annals.

This is not the case with "Khotan, Samarkand, Koguryo, Japan and SE Asian nations..." where China had active trade interests.

As for Tibetan Ministers, well, they were soldiers; and even in the time of the 5th Dalai Lama, there were certain kinds of animal sacrifices done in Lhasa. This does not mean that the population as a whole were not interested in Dharma.
