The interlocutor in the Madhyamakaśāstra is apparently Sammitiya. It would make sense if Ven Nāgārjuna was a dissident from the same, critiquing it from an insider's perspective and putting authentic words into his interlocutor's mouth in the MMK.

yes, we infer this from Nāgārjuna's sole state preference, that is, for the avipranaśa theory of karmic residuum, that and the fact that the Sammitiya school was dominant in Andra Pradesh, where he apparently resided.

One, this is quite well known. But a little misleading. Many people have overlooked the fact that the maṅgalam of the MMK is a formula found in the PP sūtras.

Thus, this factoid does not have the implication you seek, i.e. that Nāgārjuna only based himself on the Agamas, since it is directly contradicted by other Mahāyāna works he composed.

The reason he only cites that verse is because the śravaka scholars who were his contemporaries did not understand the meaning of dependent origination.

My point was and is, one needs to be careful in invoking Sapan when complaining about "progress," if you yourself are engaged in practices which Sapan scoffed at——in Jampa Thaye's case, both Kagyu Mahāmudra and the terma tradition. Trying to position yourself as a Buddhist conservative using Sapan as an authority when yourself engage in practices of which Sapan plainly rejected, well, a little inept. Otherwise, I am sure Jampa Thaye is a nice fellow. I never met him.

Dharmasherab said:

Malcolm wrote:
One should rely on a doctrine taught by the Buddhas, realized by mahasiddhas, commented upon by panditas, and translated by the lotsawas. That's it. All of Thaye's other remarks are just so much conservative whinging that have nothing to with Buddhadharma. I mean, what are we to make of Aśoka murdering 18,000 Jains over a satirical cartoon? Continue to revere him as the ideal Dharmarāja? Come on.

This, "The rejection of progress as incompatible with the very nature of dharma...," is a ridiculous assertion, as ridiculous as those people whom Salya Pandita chided for rejecting medicine because some people imagine, foolishly, that accepting medicine to cure illness means one has no faith in Dharma.

He directly contradicts himself in the very next passage:

The Mahayana notion of universal enlightenment should not, however, be misunderstood as a claim that progress toward Buddhahood is somehow structured into the very nature of the world, and that we are always reaching ever closer to it. Instead, its sense is that all beings will obtain enlightenment because they are primordially pervaded by buddhanature, the true nature of reality itself.

If the true nature of reality is buddhanature (it isn't, only sentient beings have buddhanature, not rocks and trees) then progress towards buddhahood is structured into the nature of the world.


This is also poorly written, "Buddhism offers a contrary idea of history. It teaches us that history, as the manifestation of samsara, is essentially cyclical in nature." Buddhism does not teach anything at all about history. History is a modern, empirically-based discipline, which did not exist in the time of the Buddha. At best, during the time of the Buddha, there was only "Itihasa," that is, just so stories.

The funny thing, he could be criticizing the right wing author, Francis Fukuyama here, "The notion of inevitable progress has been so tenacious that today’s dominant liberal and Marxist ideologies, which have in one way or another sought to replace Christianity, have swallowed its historical narrative without demur. They have merely recast it in terms of an inevitable social and intellectual progress culminating in the end of history itself."  Of course, Fukuyama retreated from his neoconservative ideals in the wake of the Iraq war:

https://www.spiegel.de/international/in ... 07315.html

Finally he says, in contradiction to his whole spiel, "The task before us in the 21st century is not to alter the timeless message of the Buddha, but, once we have received it fully (a process which may well have some way to go!), to present it in the language and organizational forms most appropriate for the contemporary situation."

This happens organically anyway. There is no need to contrive this, especially by going off like some Buddhist William F. Buckley Jr. on the supposed tragedies of "liberalism." What people have to do is learn Tibetan, receive the teachings, do the retreats, and pass on the teachings. Personal politics has very little to do with this process. But when people begin citing people like Sapan, who was a strict formalist when it came discerning which teachings were of valid provenance as opposed to Tibetan innovations, they had better make sure they are not hoisting themselves on their own petards.

Any time you use contemporary Liberal Western socio-political models that posit one identity group "systemically oppressing" another by virtue of identity alone and the amorphous "social structures" in place, you necessarily imply Marx and Hegel because that "class binary" of "oppressor" and "oppressee" is simply the Marxist dialectical structure except the "classes" are swapped with identity groups.

The narrative of "majority" identity groups oppressing "minority" identity groups and the oppressed identity groups, by virtue of being oppressed, have morally correction sociopolitical opinions, is a Western theory that has nothing to do with Buddhism, and to the extent that it's affected Asian Buddhism, that's by virtue of Western corruption.

Malcolm wrote:
There is no such thing as an ideal-type, pure Asian Buddhism. Demonstrably, Buddhism has been affected by ideas from the west nearly from its inception, for example, the adoption by the Bactrian branch of Sarvāstivādin school of Aristotle's four causes, as well as Greek atomism, etc.

What is new, for Buddhism to deal with in the West is the West's history of imperialism, genocide, and slavery, and how this is has negatively impacted people of non-European ancestry, for example, the near-extinction of Buddhism in Śrī Lanka under the British, the purge of Buddhism in Japan, following nationalist and modernist impulses when Japan was engaged in a process of assimilation to modern capitalism, and so on. This continues as  westerners of European descent— blind to their economic privilege which they received as the inheritors 500+ years of Western imperialist expansion and oppression—adopt Buddhism without seeing that their privilege, when it goes unrecognized, can serve to limit the participation of people of non-European descent in Buddhist teaching and practice in the United States, Canada, England, France, Germany, and so on, including people of descent from Buddhist countries.

For example, when I was in China, many Tibetans were quite jealous of the amount of teachings I had received, and I experienced the same comments from monks from India. White people in America and Europe are given special privileges and access to teachings often unobtainable for common, average Tibetans.

Heimdall said:
By the way, if "whiteness" was such a problem that we should dismiss social opinions by virtue of genetics, we should disavow Buddhism altogether, considering the Buddha, according to the 32 marks, had blue eyes.

Malcolm wrote:
There are many people who have blue eyes who are not "white." "Blue eyeness" is a recessive gene, which has only existed in human populations for 6,000 to 10,000 years or so.

Of course, we do have to keep in mind that people with blond hair were forbidden to ordain as monks at one time. So there is that.

If Catholicism with its Roman mysticism, unmolested by the Protestant revolution had encountered Japanese Mahayana, the conversations between Tendai acharyas and Catholic monks - if we could suspend the missionary impulses of the Catholics - might have been an interesting encounter between two catholic approaches that each entertained great intellectual flexibility and comparable mysticism.

Malcolm wrote:
We already have an example this. A Jesuit priest went to Tibet:

Mission to Tibet recounts the fascinating eighteenth-century journey of the Jesuit priest ippolito Desideri (1684 - 1733) to the Tibetan plateau. The italian missionary was most notably the first european to learn about Buddhism directly with Tibetan schol ars and monks - and from a profound study of its primary texts. while there, Desideri was an eyewitness to some of the most tumultuous events in Tibet's history, of which he left us a vivid and dramatic account.

Desideri explores key Buddhist concepts including emptiness and rebirth, together with their philosophical and ethical implications, with startling detail and sophistication. This book also includes an introduction situating the work in the context of Desideri's life and the intellectual and religious milieu of eighteenth-century Catholicism.




And Jesuits were in Japan, but it seems Francis Xavier took no pains to learn about any form of Buddhism. And as you know, the Catholics attempted to purge Buddhism from Kyushu, beginning in 1562.

Queequeg said:
I wonder if things would have been different if the Jesuits had arrived in Japan by themselves without armed trade missions? I'm guessing the isolation of Tibet limited the efforts of Europeans to open direct trade, and so Jesuits like Desideri showed up pretty much on their own and were forced to navigate individually, whereas the Jesuits in Japan came with some imperial power that maybe enabled their missionary arrogance and closed their mind to more open engagement, and conversely, got them greater suspicion from the samurai who would see them not as relatively harmless nerds but rather the apparatus of those greedy traders with dreams of colonization.

Malcolm wrote:
It as not all roses:

Queequeg said:
However, it would appear that about the time that Gioachino reached Rome, persecution of the Capuchins broke out in Lhasa. The jealous Tibetan monastic community viewed the open patronage of the missionaries by Polhanas and other highly placed secular officials with increasingly intolerable disfavor. The tension increased until one day in May 1742 when several hundred furious Gelugpa lamas invaded the royal palace and upbraided Polhanas for his partiality. The Tibetan ruler, terrified of meeting the same fate as his unfortunate predecessors, immediately declared that the Capuchin priests had fallen from his favor. The frightened king of Tibet also forbade the missionaries from preaching Christianity in the country, except to outside traders. The Tibetan government further ordered that local converts be hunted down, placed in Chinese wooden collars (cangue), and flogged. Tremendously frustrated by this turn of events, the Capuchin fathers began to realize that the time had arrived for them to abandon their work. A momentary compromise was reached between the Capuchins and the Lhasa authorities when Polhanas reluctantly allowed the priests to preach only on condition that they should declare Tibetan Buddhism to abound in goodness and perfection. The friars lingered on in Lhasa for another two and a half years until April 1745 when the valiant Father Orazio della Penna finally acknowledged himself beaten, and resolved to abandon the mission.

Malcolm wrote:
Modern historical method is not false, it is, as much as possible, empirical and evidence-based. It is limited in so far as the evidence that can be mustered is limited.

Assertions by the ancients that cannot be empirically verified or disproven are left aside as unproven— not false, not true, just unverified. Things like the geocentrism, etc., which are demonstrably false, given the evidence, of course ought to be left in the dustbin of mistaken notions. Axial mountain myths are understandable and inspiring, but in the end they are just myths.

Also ancient scholars weren't dummies. For example, Sakya Pandita shows, based on textual sources, namely the Mahābharata, that identifying Kailash as Mt. Meru is impossible. Ancient scholars too had their empirical standards of evidence, especially ancient Buddhist scholars. The thing about empirical knowledge is that it changes with the evidence, as it should.

When one is writing history, one must adhere to what can be empirically shown with evidence. Otherwise, it is not history at all. It is just opinion and conjecture. The very real inability to distinguish between opinion and conjecture on the one hand, and evidence on the other, is one of the great failings of the modern educational system, which has largely abandoned rationality in favor of technology. Some of the stupidest, most gullible people I have ever met are really good at math, engineering, and applied science. But when it comes to anything else, dumb as rocks.

If Catholicism with its Roman mysticism, unmolested by the Protestant revolution had encountered Japanese Mahayana, the conversations between Tendai acharyas and Catholic monks - if we could suspend the missionary impulses of the Catholics - might have been an interesting encounter between two catholic approaches that each entertained great intellectual flexibility and comparable mysticism.

Malcolm wrote:
We already have an example this. A Jesuit priest went to Tibet:

Mission to Tibet recounts the fascinating eighteenth-century journey of the Jesuit priest ippolito Desideri (1684 - 1733) to the Tibetan plateau. The italian missionary was most notably the first european to learn about Buddhism directly with Tibetan schol ars and monks - and from a profound study of its primary texts. while there, Desideri was an eyewitness to some of the most tumultuous events in Tibet's history, of which he left us a vivid and dramatic account.

Desideri explores key Buddhist concepts including emptiness and rebirth, together with their philosophical and ethical implications, with startling detail and sophistication. This book also includes an introduction situating the work in the context of Desideri's life and the intellectual and religious milieu of eighteenth-century Catholicism.




And Jesuits were in Japan, but it seems Francis Xavier took no pains to learn about any form of Buddhism. And as you know, the Catholics attempted to purge Buddhism from Kyushu, beginning in 1562.

The thing that changed in me was connected to developing bodhicitta from extremely slight to a little less slight. And I kind of realised that politics always = asura mentality. It is always about victory, and about vanquishing "those immoral" others. This can be coarse to the degree of actual violence, or extremely subtle, to degree of the merest thought of righteousness justifying moral-political superiority. If one retains this in the mindstream, one will part from bodhicitta.

Malcolm wrote:
The Asura mentality means being jealous of what others have and feeling cheated by them. The deva mentality means being proud of one’s status and entitled to one’s possessions, without caring for others.

The lesson of the destruction of the city Tripura for us is not that devas should overcome the asuras in a vicious class struggle, but rather, the devas should contribute to the welfare of the asuras because the trunk of the wishfulfilling tree grows through their land, so they have rights to its fruit also. Politics done right, like FDR, Johnson, etc,  keep this in mind. Politics done wrong, the GOP since Hoover, ignore this to our collective peril.

Is it possible to ordain in any of the Tibetan traditions and stay vegan? I have debated on posting this since I know the vegan/vegetarian topic can spark a lot of debate and controversy, but I can not find any information about it online so I wanted to ask here since many seem knowledgeable. Coming from the East Asian traditions I know it is possible there, but unsure on Tibetan traditions. Metta

Könchok Thrinley said:
Absolutely no problem. Here is a good bunch of resources. http://www.shabkar.org/vegetarianism/index.htm

All I would only advise is to realise that dharma should be a priority not some dietery prefference. I personally try to be vegan as much as possible, however when food with meat is offered I take it as it creates a link between me and the person and they are being generous in however small amount and since I am on the path (however badly and trust me I am very bad at this) sooner or later I will attain enlightenment hopefully (probably in billions of eons, but still that is something) and so I will be able to benefit them.

Also during tsok I take the meet if it is there as thems the rules.

We have to realise that veganism is still seeing things through materialistic viewpoint. They care only about the animals current life not other lives. While dharma cares also about the future lives. So try to make connection with the animals, say mantras infront of them and msot importantly do not create bad views of masters and disciples based on what they eat or not eat.

Few months back I saw vegans bashing a theravada monk for saying when monks are allowed to eat food, citing one "quote" from Buddha and completely ignoring the rest. That is bad, he did nothing wrong just shared the teachings.

So yeah... to end my ramble. Ofc you can be vegan buddhist, there is a plenty of us. Also whatever I wrote is just my view. No need to take it too seriously.

James84 said:
Thank you for your reply. How would it work if a monk was vegan and the monastery was having tsok? I understand that if they were offered meat they would have to accept it, but not consume it themselves.

Malcolm wrote:
As long as you never become a practitioner of Highest Yoga Tantra, this will never be a problem and you will never have to participate in a tsok.

James84 said:
Although with meat being a part of tsok, how would that work for a monk trying to be vegan or vegetarian? Could they simply visualize themselves eating it, or must consumption of meat be taken during these rituals? If it is required that leads me to believe one could not be fully vegan and a Tibetan monastic.

Malcolm wrote:
You are generally required to just taste it, at minimum. Otherwise, it is a serious infraction. However, these days, Karma Kagyu monasteries are favoring meatless tsoks, even though I don't agree with this practice.

The best way to avoid this issue in Tantric teachings is to pursue only the lower tantras.

Sure. There is no requirement to eat meat in Buddhism. However, in all schools you are not allowed to reject food which is donated to you. The exception to this are those bhikshus who adopt the ten ascetic vows.

Yes. We know. This is not the fact-free assertions to which Peter was referring. In my personal experience, left-leaning people (as opposed to radical leftists) are more open-minded and accepting of cultures differing from than their own. Education also has great deal to do with this—but not STEM education, rather humanities education— because people study things like literature, anthropology, philosophy, etc., tend to be more flexible thinkers. People educated in STEM programs are as likely to tack right as left, because STEM programs do not teach humanities. The great sadness I feel in the American educational system is the lack of comprehensive humanities education in grade 1-12 education. So many of our kids arrive in college barely able to read and write. They are good at filling in circles with graphite pencils though.

Now you’re just being ridiculous.  Atheists absolutely do not enjoy a position of disproportionate social influence.  The Christians do.  What is the representation of nominal Christians in Congress, or state houses, vs the professed representation in the general population?  How does that compare to those professing other religions or no religion?

nightbloom said:
I didn't claim that Christians aren't still able to wield political power. Recent legislation in Texas proves that. But there are forms of power besides explicit political power. The secular "caste" I'm referring to overlaps heavily with what people sometimes called the "PMC" (professional managerial class), tends to be educated, concentrated in management, journalism, education, entertainment, the arts and so on. Tends to be wealthy, but not always... and ultimately, status and virtue/piety are often prized above raw wealth. It's largely, but not entirely, white. Tends to be "irreligious" (though I think politics substitute for religion in this case), if not outright hostile to religion. Leans (further and further) left.

It's not the sole power in our culture, but it's influential, despite its small size. It's not a perfect comparison, but I think it's better described as a kind of informal caste (with initiation largely conferred through education) rather than a class. In fact, I think that one could learn a lot about it by studying the history of caste in India. I'm thinking of the way brahmins historically held onto their power (which waxed and waned, of course) via their *purity* codes and control over knowledge.

I also suspect that the reason why this thread has been so heated is because many western Buddhists belong to this caste, share its attitudes, material concerns, and so on. Hard to leave behind one's conditioning entirely, but Buddhists should make an effort, in my opinion.

You see, if you do not recognize a form of suffering, you cannot have compassion for the person experiencing it. This is why the discussion of privilege, etc., as well as the absurd lengths white conservatives (and some PoC too, like Dinesh Desouza, etc.) go to rail against the idea, as well as try to discredit things like CRT, etc. is important for Buddhists to acknowledge and engage. It exposes to us a level of suffering which we have been insulated from, because of structural disadvantages baked into our system, especially in America. Structural disadvantages such as the racial covenants in real estate, millions of which still exist in the language of many deeds to houses, especially in communities in the Midwest through California that were built after the WWI.

Well, if people would address the actual point of the thread...rather than freaking out over whether they are personally being accused being white supremacists, it might get somewhere.

But for some reason, white people feel so guilty about racism, they can never discuss it without feeling shame. Pity. I don't feel shame for being born a white person. I do feel that white people are sheltered from the effects of racism in this country. We did an enormously successful job of instituting apartheid in the US. It was not dismantled in in 1963 and 1965. It still exists. It exists in all of our institutions and in our communities, including Buddhist communities. For example, I was at a teaching in Alameda CA. in 2019. Out of three hundred people, there were a few Chinese people, a few Tibetans, a few Latinos, two or three trans people, some gay people, but mostly whites, and not a single Black person. And this is in a place one mile from Oakland. Now I am not saying there are no Black people who use this temple. There may be. I don't live there. But in CA and elsewhere, most Tibetan Buddhist communities have almost no Black participation. Now, we can rationalize this with things like throwing karma, precious human birth, but that is in some sense bullshit. In my experience, Dharma communities are not welcoming to to Black people, over all.

While studying for my Divinity degree at Naropa University, a professor of mine asked me in Zen kōan fashion the question: “Does a Bodhisattva get Angry?” Now, why I, a Black man, was given this kōan is questionable, however, I would like to think in my respect for this teacher, that they were very aware of the potential for anger for a person of color in this society and not simply stereotyping me as another “angry Negro.”

I can’t remember my exact answer, but I am sure that it was a load of bull about experiencing anger vs. acting out of anger. I gave the common liberal religious response that I was expected to give, my assimilation was confirmed with a smile. However, that answer is misleading and a non-sequitur, klesha, by definition, takes over your mind, your well being, your identity and you can’t simply and dispassionately experience klesha, i.e., powerful emotions, such as, passion and aggression.

...

In a recent article posted by Noriyuki Ueda and published in Tricycle, His Holiness the Dalai Lama speaks about anger and his words seem to contradict those aforementioned words of the Buddha, and even His Holiness’ own words on anger. When speaking of anger and social injustice, His Holiness differentiates between an anger that is motivated by hatred and an anger that arises in response to injustice.

In response to the question of whether we can transform anger to something more acceptable like compassion, His Holiness explains that this second anger, anger in response to injustice, doesn’t go away so easily. He says “anger toward social injustice will remain until the goal is achieved. It has to remain.” I, for the life of me, cannot reconcile this with the words of the Buddha, the words of Shantideva in the Bodhicaryāvatāra, not even in my tantric wrathful-compassion practices.

Personally, I am not angry, but I am concerned. And I think the Trump Presidency has exposed a vein of racism in this country that lay dormant. It's a vein that threatens our democracy. Not sure if you are from the US, but frankly, this is no time to be complacent. If what passes for democracy fails in the US, it will fail everywhere else.

Confronting that racism requires facing it directly, and exposing it where it is. But this makes white people uncomfortable, understandably, especially white buddhists, it seems. Well, good, it should make you uncomfortable. You need to feel uncomfortable. It is necessary for you to feel uncomfortable. Because if you are not uncomfortable you are not paying attention, and your dharma is just pablum to feed your egos.

Why is there backlash? For the same reason that in the 1930's schools in the US were forbidden to teach about economic inequality, etc. In reality, the backlash against CRT has resulted in censorship in American schools. Teachers, in many GOP controlled school districts, are no longer allowed to teach about the Civil Rights movement, and many other topics because it might make fragile white schoolchildren feel bad about themselves.

That specific sadhana is the only place I've seen this mantra used. I've never seen it referenced anywhere else, not in an article or teaching, nor in a practice text from outside the Drikung Kagyu school. In all other Medicine Buddha practices I've seen, the long mantra is this, or some variation of it:

OM NAMO BHAGAVATE BHAISHAJYE / GURU BAIDURYA / PRABHA RADJAYA / TATHAGATAYA / ARHATE SAMYAKSAM BUDDHAYA / TADYATHA / OM BHAISHAJYE BHAISHAJYE MAHA BHAISHAJYE [BHAISHAJYE ] / RAJA SAMUDGATE SVAHA

Does anybody know where the first mantra is from, and if it's specific to the Drikung Kagyu or if other traditions use it as well? Every other source I've seen so far uses the second mantra.

And materialism does not foreclose the possibility of liberation. It merely defines it differently, just as Hindus, Christians, etc. define liberation differently we do. This is where looking at Epicurean thought is useful.

Materialists (and not all atheists are materialists) are looking to alleviate their existential anxieties in this life, before they die. The Secular Humanist movement is an example of materialist atheists who are not merely money-grubbing Walter Gecko types, or futurists, etc:

Zhen Li said:
How do we deal with them? To win someone over, you have to allow them to see your point of view from their point of view. Do you continue to frame it in antagonistic terms or try to find a new way of approaching the matter?
Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.—In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.

Now, again, I am not saying that if you practice Advaita you will become a buddha -- I honestly do not know. But I am saying that when you study these things, philosophically, at any rate, it is very hard to show the difference between Advaita and Madhyamaka. The main difference between them is that Hindus accept the Vedas as self-originated and Buddhists do not.
Right, because Shankara via Gaudapada, used Madhyamaka arguments to defeat his Hindu colleagues. So context.

But in Dzogchen we accept that Dzogchen tantras are self-originated, that they arise directly out of the sound of dharmatā. So, this is not really very different than what the Vedic scholars believe. For example, the Song of the Vajra is just the intrinsic sound of dharmatā, the state of realization of Samantabhadra and Samantabhadri in union.
Yes, from the point of view of mere words, not much different; from the point of view of meaning, very different.
Though Dzogchen tantras do take pains to differentiate themselves from Upanishadic doctrines of the atman, these very same ideas get used in Dzogchen in a very similar way -- which is why there is a rebuttal in Dzogchen tantras of certain ideas we find in the Upanishads so we don't run out and say "The Upanishads teach the same thing as Dzogchen".
Yes, Indian Tantras and Dzogchen tantras occupy a milieu that shares a myth space with nonBuddhists. But the ways in which these myths are employed are completely different from one another.
So we can find a lot of parallels in Dzogchen and non-Buddhist teachings.
Sure, we can find a lot of parallels in Buddhism and nonBuddhist teachings in general: they have śila; we have śila; they practice compassion, we practice compassion. They have a version of karma, we have a version of karma. This is all true, but what distinguishes us from them, is that we are insiders, our liberation comes from understanding our condition, and we reject external liberation of any kind. Of course, some will argue that the nondual Hindu traditions, and even Samkhya, is similar-- they also find their liberation inside, however, they are eternalists and reject dependent origination, so they do not really find their liberation inside.

The one main difference between Dzogchen and most non-Buddhist traditions is that in Dzogchen there is a definite rejection of creation by a creator. Even in Advaita, on a relative level, they accept Ishvara as a creator. So this is an important difference.

Don't beleive it when people say that Kun byed rgyal po is a Buddhist creator myth. It is not true. Kun byed gyal po refers to the mind. It does not mean Samantabhadra is a primordial creator deity or a kind of Buddhism theism. People who claim this like Alan Wallace and Eva Dargyay-Neumier are mistaken.
And here is the rub. We are atheists.
But as Chogyal Namkhai Norbu says, "God" can be understood as a symbol of one's primordial state. So we do not necessarily have to reject "God" if we are Dzogchen practitioners, if by "God" we mean our own primordial potentiality and the primordial potentiality of everything.
And this so-called "god" aka basis [gzhi] is just a nonexistent mere appearance, that is, our primordial potentiality also has no real existence, which is stated over and over again in countless Dzogchen tantras.

For those whom emptiness is possible, everything is possible.
For those whom emptiness is not possible, nothing is possible.

Also, I still feel that we have common ground with realist polytheists. Not sure it's in the Bodhicaryavatara or another text but there is at least one Indian Buddhist text that says that between realism and annihilationism, it's better to be a realist.

There is a statement in the Ratnavali where it is held that it is better to be an eternalist than an annihilationist (Of course, in the Yuktiṣaṣṭika, Nāgārjuna declares that having negated nonexistence, the source of faults, one must then reject existence). But this can be seen as defensive move on the part of Buddhists, because the actual works of Indian materialists have been erased from history. We have no Lokayati texts. What we known of them comes from parodies and lampoons. But to be an ucchedavadin means really, to negate rebirth. But it does not mean one affirms powerful divinities as having any role at all one's liberation.

MiphamFan said:
From another PoV we are polytheists, we just don't have a supreme deity.

Malcolm wrote:
Yeah, we really are not. Polytheism attributes control of the world through various functions of external deities. We certainly give lip service to such concepts, but again, the Buddhist thought about such beings is much like that of Epicurean thought:

Lucretius presents Epicurus’ chief achievement as the defeat of religio. Although this Latin word is correctly translated into English as ‘religion’, its literal meaning is ‘binding down’, and it therefore serves Lucretius as a term, not for all attitudes of reverence towards the divine, but for those which cow people’s spirits, rather than, as he thinks such attitudes should, elevate them to a joyful state of tranquility.

......

Either way, what is not in doubt is that the gods’ role as moral ideals is paramount in the Epicurean system. And this is the function Lucretius too gives them, especially in the proems to books 1, 3, 5 and 6. The gods live a supremely tranquil life, never disquieted by either favour or anger towards us. By contemplating them as they truly are we can aspire to achieve that same blissful state within the confines of a human lifespan. But Lucretius adds another dimension to this theology: What Lucretius effectively asserts is that, on a Euhemeristic ranking, Epicurus is a far greater god than Ceres or Bacchus, held to have originally been the institutors of, respectively, agriculture and wine, and also a far greater god than the divinized Hercules. For Hercules rid the world merely of literal monsters like the Hydra, but it’s not as if there aren’t plenty of wild beasts left in the world to terrorize us today. Epicurus on the other hand has offered us real and permanent salvation from monsters, namely those truly frightful monsters that haunt our souls, such as insatiable desires, fears, and arrogance.

.....

Lucretius was both admired and imitated by writers of the early Roman empire, while in the eyes of Latin patristic authors like Lactantius he came to serve as the leading spokesman of the godless Epicurean philosophy. His poem subsequently survived in two outstanding 9th-century manuscripts (known as O and Q), which following the poem’s rediscovery by the papal secretary Poggio Bracciolini in 1417 (for this fascinating story see Greenblatt 2011) became the basis of the Renaissance editions. It was through Lucretius, along with the Latin translation of Diogenes Laertius’ Life of Epicurus, that Epicurean ideas entered the main philosophical (especially ethical) debates of the age. However, despite his extensive impact in literary and philosophical circles—he is, for example, among the writers most assiduously cited by Montaigne—Lucretius struggled for two centuries to shake off the pejorative label of ‘atheist’.
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lucretius


The impact of the Epicurean thought on the Enlightenment is much neglected.

As I have often mentioned, if I were to select a western philosophy to emulate, it would be that of Epicurus and Lucretius.

Here is another tidbit:

Epicurus rejected the conventional Greek view of the gods as anthropomorphic beings who walked the earth like ordinary people, fathered illegitimate offspring with mortals, and pursued personal feuds.[111] Instead, he taught that the gods are morally perfect, but detached and immobile beings who live in the remote regions of interstellar space.[112] In line with these teachings, Epicurus adamantly rejected the idea that deities were involved in human affairs in any way.[110][113] Epicurus maintained that the gods are so utterly perfect and removed from the world that they are incapable of listening to prayers or supplications or doing virtually anything aside from contemplating their own perfections.[112] In his Letter to Herodotus, he specifically denies that the gods have any control over natural phenomena, arguing that this would contradict their fundamental nature, which is perfect, because any kind of worldly involvement would tarnish their perfection.[113] He further warned that believing that the gods control natural phenomena would only mislead people into believing the superstitious view that the gods punish humans for wrongdoing, which only instills fear and prevents people from attaining ataraxia.[113]

Nor is the notion that "As it is without, so too is it within," and so on, or the emanationist flavor of tantric cosmology/physiology (so conspicuously overlapping with its Indian sibling traditions such as Shaivism, etc), or the alchemical logic of its ritual, etc.

At least for me the backstory and justfications are not important. What matters is what happens at the empowerment and the following practices. Guhyagarbha has this long story about Rudra taking over the universe. It's not important that it be true. What's important is the meaning about karma. Guhyagarbha is pretty neat bc it explicitly says it was taught in Akansitha which in the commentary is inside one's body.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, this is the common theme in Nyingma tantras, for which Guhyagarbha is original template.

No, we are talking about is philosophical similarities between Buddhists and materialists which cause us to share a common atheistic outlook.

What I have observed, having been in the Dharma for 30 years, is that people with theistic tendencies fit uneasily into Buddhadharma, and tend to reify theism in their understanding of Buddhadharma. For example, I first studied Madhyamaka etc., with Malcolm David Eckle, who is an expert on Bhavaviveka. I was very surprised to learn he as a Christian, and as much as he admired Madhyamaka, he was relieved he was not a Buddhist. Or Paul Williams, who wrote a popular book on Mahayana, and after a long career as a Buddhist academic, converted to Catholicism.

The problem here is that you seem to believe that being an atheist entails adhering to logical positivism.

It fact, the essence of atheism is denying supernatural causation to explain natural phenomena. Like modern atheists we reject first cause, prime movers, and creators. Like modern atheists, we assert ethics should be grounded in rationality, rather than divine ordinances. As Candrakirti pointed out, the only difference between us and materialists is that we accept karma and rebirth. Otherwise, our points of view are more similar than they are different.

So you reject Patrul's own testimony with Do Khyentse? That is not mythical, not even slightly.

He reports a similar incident with a stonemason he met in Kham, again, personal testimony, not myth. The incident was that there was this man who was building a wall on the side of the road. But as soon as the wall was built on one side of the road, he would tear it down stone by stone and build it on the other side. Dezhung Ajam got the idea that the man might be a practitioner of separation of samsara and nirvana, so he asked the man what he was doing, and the man struck him on the head with the stone he was carrying. Deshung Ajam reports that right there he had vivid experience of the nature of his mind, and even though he never knew the name of the mad stonemason, he always referred to this man as one of his root gurus.

And then of course there is my friend.

Don't sleep with your students. Don't physically or sexually assault them. Make sure your finances are transparent. It's not really so difficult?

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, it is a little difficult.

Let's start the last item, obviously money run through nonprofits has to be transparent by law. Personal gifts, dana, is private, not subject to taxation, etc., nor should it be.

Moving on the first item, there is no actual reason it is necessarily wrong for teachers to sleep with students, as long as it is consensual. There are some people who will argue that it can never be consensual. I don't buy that argument.

As for the second item, these are legal terms. If someone assaults someone this is either a misdemeanor or a felony, depending. If a student, for example, receives a blow from a teacher, and declines to press charges, that will generally be the end of it and should be the end of it. If they are beaten to a pulp, that is a different matter. Sexual assault is more serious, because that is always a crime. You neglected to mention verbal assault, BTW.

For example, in America, in the 1960's, it was permissible for elementary school teachers to slap students. I got slapped once, in second grade. Parents generally felt this was ok. By the 1980's, this was no longer ok. These things are never so cut and dry as people want to make them.

In some states in the US, it is illegal for licensed minister to sleep with a parishioner.  In most, it is not. At this point, very few Buddhist teachers are licensed members of the clergy. Generally, it is because such licensure depends on some kind of ordination and endorsement by a religious body which shows the member is in good standing, etc., and the vast majority of Buddhist teachers are not ordained and do not belong to these kinds of organized religious groups. So, it is really not as simple as you want it to be, with your reductionist set of guidelines. Many Tibetan male lay teachers active today pursue relationships among their students, if they are not married (and sometimes, even if they are, sometimes even if they are ordained). I could give you a list but in the interest of people's privacy, I am not going to. Frankly, what people do in their private lives is none of our business, as long as it is not criminal. I know a lot of people who are disappointed that Sogyal did not live long enough to be taken to court again. People point to the San Francisco Zen Center as a place which gives a good road map, but Richard Baker never stopped teaching, not ever. People still excuse Seungsahn's behavior, though, frankly, again, what people do on their own time is their own business. His Kwan Um centers are widespread in America, they are all over the place. It's such old news though, I think most new students have no idea. Maybe they are entrance counseled about it, I don't know. NKT, still going strong, after myriad sex and ethics scandals. Shambhala will continue. Diamond Mt. shut down, but Michael Roach is still out there, even being implicated in the death of one of his closest students did not stop him.

So, the only course is to make sure you examine the teacher.

Decolonizing Buddhist Studies

Religious studies is finally beginning to come to terms with its colonialist past. Discussions related to decolonizing religious studies are becoming increasingly prominent, not only in forums like this blog, but also in places like the annual meetings of the American Academy of Religion, the main academic gathering for scholars of religion in the US. We still have a long way to go, but the fact that these conversations are even happening is promising.

Within religious studies, however, scholars of Buddhism have remained largely absent from these discussions. Buddhist studies, on the whole, has not acknowledged, let alone addressed, issues of colonization, white supremacy, and the erasure of Asian people and cultures within the field. And with the news of a white man murdering Asian women on March 16, 2021, an attack that followed in the wake of increased anti-Asian violence related to misinformation about the coronavirus pandemic, scholars of Buddhist studies need to acknowledge where we stand in all of this, beyond simply expressing our outrage at specific incidents of explicit hate.

The book contained essays by Buddhist scholars and scholar-practitioners examining both how whiteness operates in Buddhist practice and academic communities, and what resources Buddhist thought and practice offer for challenging whiteness. While this was the first academic collection to attend to whiteness in Buddhism, Buddhists of Color have been confronting whiteness in American Buddhism for over two and a half decades. The landmark 2000 compilation Making the Invisible Visible: Healing Racism in our Buddhist Communities, for instance, shared that for many years the white Euro-American sangha has been resistant to efforts by People of Color to raise awareness of racism in Buddhist communities.

Well, for starters, he did not punch her very hard, it was a kind of a running joke between them, nevertheless he was mad. Second, he and she hugged and giggled immediately after the famous punch. And there is the third point, which is that the nun in question completely disagreed with how this was covered by the media, is still a loyal student of Sogyal, and refused to press charges of assault. But of course her point of view is brushed off as being a mere cult member cluelessness and blind devotion.

Now, let me clarify, Sogyal did have a penchant for hitting his students with his famous backscratcher. He hit someone I know in the head with it quite solidly once. My friend claims that this blow allowed him to understand the nature of the mind. It cut right through all his bullshit. I believe him, because this person has a very good understanding of Dzogchen teachings. I am pretty confident that Sogyal had a very good understanding of Dzogchen teachings as well. Having a good understanding of Dzogchen teachings does not necessarily make one a nice person to be around.

Now, I myself would be prefer to humiliated in front of 300 people by being yelled on a hot mic for being a young, arrogant scholar (as happened with Chogyal Namkhai Norbu in 1992, which by the way sealed the deal for me about ChNN), some people get it by being hit in public, others by being hit with sandals, backscratchers, etc. I am not saying that we have to stay with gurus who we feel are abusive or appear abusive. I am saying we need to be careful about how we judge the interactions of other people with their teachers. The people who wrote the letter, and the people who have come forward about their experience of Sogyal, felt abused. Others, experiencing just the same conduct at the same time, did not, and defended their teacher. I cannot condemn either side for the way they behaved.

In the end, it is caveat emptor, on the part of both the teacher and the student. The teacher has to examine the student well. The student has to examine the teacher well. It is clear that many Rigpa students did not examine the teacher well; it is equally clear the teacher did not examine the students well. So, in the end, they both suffered. While I would not blame his ex-students, it is pretty clear to me that Sogyal died in a state of profound sadness, and died earlier than he would have otherwise as a result of the whole thing. And people cannot give it up, still they incessantly criticize Sogyal as the Tibetan Guru Bogeyman, honestly, there are worse teachers out there, in the past and also still active, I am quite sure.

Many Asian teaches, from a Western point of view, have very poor boundaries. It's ok to have boundaries, but one should understand that in the traditional guru disciple relationship in Vajrayāna Buddhism, those boundaries can be sorely tested. Most of the problem these days arises from this kind of misunderstanding. Some of it is cultural. In old Tibet, if a renowned guru wanted to sleep with someone, it was regarded as an honor, bringing fortune to everyone, for obvious reasons which are not spiritual at all and totally patriarchal and sexist. Here, if a guru wants to sleep with someone, he or she is immediately a creep, a pervert, a libertine, a scoundrel, because we have a different set of values derived from how we view the clerical trade in West, and what kind of boundaries should be observed. If one is priest, celibacy; if one is minister, one should be in a strictly monogamous union.

In the end, we need to be careful about who we take as our teachers, just as they need to be careful about who they choose as students.

It is super weird, actually:

MiphamFan said:
Life does not end at the death of the physical body. The body dies but the soul does not. It lives on in a counterpart of the physical body which is called the astral body. The astral body is made of astral matter and resides in a world not unlike this one, called the Devaloka or Second world. In other words, in order to perfect itself, to spiritually unfold and evolve, the soul lives on in another body after death, the astral body. At the right time, according to its karma, it is reborn into a flesh body. Thus the astral body, with the soul within it, enters a new physical body. This same cycle is repeated many times until the soul spiritually unfolds and reaches a certain state of perfection or mature evolution. These repeated cycles of births and deaths are known as samsara. The soul passes from one physical body to another. Each time it does so, the Hindu says, the soul has reincarnated. This is the process to which the name “reincarnation” is given.

Therefore, the Hindu does not believe in a single life on earth, followed by eternal joy or pain. Hindus know that all souls reincarnate, take one body and then another, evolving through experience over long periods of time. To a Hindu death is not fearsome. Like the caterpillar’s metamorphosis into the delicate butterfly, death does not end our existence but frees us to pursue an even greater development. The soul never dies. It is immortal. Physical death is a most natural transition for the soul, which survives and, guided by karma, continues its long pilgrimage until it is one with its creator, God. Reincarnation is the natural cycle of birth, death & rebirth, called samsara. When we die, the soul leaves the first world physical body, it lives for a while in the Devaloka, the Second World, before returning again to earth, the Bhuloka or First World.

Malcolm wrote:
https://www.hinduismtoday.com/hindu-bas ... carnation/

This devaloka is the moon, actually. And according to Shankara, one's atman becomes vapor which rains down on plants, and then this soul gradually moves through the plant and animal kingdoms, eventually one becomes human again. I am sure the metaphor is based on the monsoon seasons in India.

MiphamFan said:
Thus, according to Hinduism, life in the ancestral heaven lasts longer, but it still is a temporary because eventually every soul that goes there has to return to the earth to continue its mortal existence. A soul may enjoy great pleasures in the ancestral heaven, but eventually its enjoyment has to end like any pleasant dream. Once its karma is exhausted, the individual soul falls down from the heights of heaven through rain and returns to the earth to participate once again in the turmoil of the unstable earthly phenomena and the ocean of births and deaths (samsara).

The scriptures explain how each soul, having the size of an atom, enters a new body in the mother’s womb upon conception and begins its rebirth. The suggested return journey starts with the falling down of the individual souls to the earth along with rain drops from the ancestral heaven, which is located in the moon. When they fall upon earth along with rain, each soul becomes deposited in the earth along with the seeping rainwater. There, they enter plants or trees through the water they absorb and become part of their sap. When those plants or trees are consumed by humans or animals they enter their bodies. Those souls which enter animal bodies may either take animal birth or await until they are consumed by humans to take human birth according to their karma. When a soul enters a male body through the aforesaid process, and if that person is destined to be its father, it becomes part of his semen (retas). From there it enters the body of female through sexual intercourse, if she is destined to be its mother, and settles in her womb inside the fertilized egg awaiting its rebirth.

Were the Jonangpas realist? If not, why are their assertions so easily mistaken for realism? If so, are they still Buddhist? Rhetorical questions, but I'm sure you take my point.

The Jonangpas are Buddhist because they go for refuge to the three jewels and engage in Buddhist training.

They are “realists, vastuvadins” because they are a subspecies of Yogacara attempts to interpret Nagarjuna through the treatises of Maitreya. Their nearest Indian exponent is Ratnakarashanti, who asserts the ultimacy of gnosis, etc.

There are three realist Buddhist tenet systems: Sarvastivada, and other shravakayana schools, Sautrantikas, and Yogacara. But here Buddhist realism means something different than the assertion of universals as real, like the Nyaya school, etc. it means asserting that disparate particulars are real or ultimate.

No, the Hindu concept of reincarnation is much stranger, much more like Pythagorean metempsychosis than the Buddhist understanding of dependent origination and karma. It’s pretty strange.

To be crystal clear, I do not intend to conflate all of these things. There is a reason why I chose to practice Buddhism and not something else. But the attempt to distance Buddhism from other traditions and place it close to contemporary atheist materialism is hard to see as anything more than an opportunistic rhetorical move designed to preserve the appearance of Buddhism's "appropriateness" within modern society. In other words, it's branding, and a rather pernicious form of branding, in my opinion...

This is even more obvious when one reflects that Buddhist practice is overflowing with things that resemble practices in other traditions (prayer, renunciation, magic) that are explicitly reviled and mocked by materialist culture.

For the record, I find the term "Spirituality" distasteful and avoid using it because of its vagueness.

Malcolm wrote:
Everyone mocks each other’s nonfalsifiable beliefs, movement atheists have many nonfalsifiable beliefs also. But that’s not the point, Buddhists offer natural mechanisms which explain all of theirs, and none of them involve relying any external force. These system, Trika, Advaita, no need to mention Samkhya, etc., are all  realist schools. Thus they are limited because they do not understand dependent origination.

Among western schools, Buddhism most closely resembles Epicureanism, then after that, Hume. Of course, we tear them apart too, but they are the closest.

I forgot to mention it, Epicurus is the father of modern, Western atheism.

Meditation is the job of religious professionals. And, I read an interesting book recently, Zen Ritual: Studies of Zen Buddhist Theory in Practice. It emphasized the fact that in many respects, in Zen temples in Japan, there was a lot of less meditation than one might expect, and that a large portion of temple activities were oriented towards ministering to the needs of the lay population with various kinds of rituals.

Is this really true? My experience has been with one of the Taiwan Chan groups, but they certainly emphasize meditation, and their origin is in Asia (and in the US the majority of the lay sangha is Asian, and all the monks I have seen). If you mean Japanese Zen specifically then I have no idea. But I also know devout people in mainland China that mediate frequently as well.

Is it the case that it depends more on the organization or tradition than the country?

Are people making a distinction here between Chan and Zen but then lumping Seon and Thein together with Zen?

Christianity, Islam, Judaism, etc are anti-democratic by nature, whereas Buddhism is not. It probably has to do with the Platonic and Neo-platonic origins of their philosophy and theology. Qabala, for example, is just reheated neoplatonism.

It is also not surprising in the least that Buddhists, in ancient India were lumped together with the carvakas by other schools, since we reject śruti, varna, etc, basically everything in the "Laws of Manu." The only difference between us and materialists, even today, is that we accept rebirth and karma, they do not.

As I mentioned before, Buddhism in all it forms is a kind of nominalism; we reject that pādārthas aka universals are real. The acceptance of the real existence of universals is a characteristic of right wing philosophy everywhere.

Moreover, while the emptiness described in the sutta is sort of comparable to madhyamaka, its really describing progressive meditative practice through the four dhyanas up to insight. Its not exactly comparable to emptiness analysis.

The lesson of understanding what's being taught is a good lesson. If one learns which lesson is being taught in a Vajrayana sadhana it's obvious one must visualize, which cannot be done in a language one doesn't understand.

Anyway, Indians recited these sadhanas in languages they understood, obviously. So did Tibetans. Accurate translation is essential.

Right. So why is it even taught?
My understanding is that the Buddha didn’t teach things that had no relevance to practice.
Is it supposed to inspire practice?
Has anyone ever known of a practitioner even getting close?

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddha always taught the whole path, whatever path he was teaching, in sūtra and tantra, so that people would understand their experiences on the path. One of the main reasons is that so that people will not mistake their experience, thinking they have realized something they have not, for example, emptiness.

For the less learned, can you explain that?

Malcolm wrote:
For Yogacārins, emptiness exists, it is strictly defined as an affirming negation; a village is empty of a city, and so on. Asanga explicitly invokes the emptiness described in the Cullasuññata sutta in a rebuke to Madhyamakas.

Queequeg said:
I've gotten around to following up on this reply.

This rebuke of Asanga is kind of a strawman, is it not? As I understand this might apply to emptiness as an analytical tool applied to dharmas, but does not apply to the so-called emptiness of emptiness.

Moreover, while the emptiness described in the sutta is sort of comparable to madhyamaka, its really describing progressive meditative practice through the four dhyanas up to insight. Its not exactly comparable to emptiness analysis.

Malcolm wrote:
Asanga is saying that emptiness, correctly understood, is like that emptiness in the Cullasuññata sutta, and the Madhyamakas go too far and negate too much.

Also, going back to the character of Vajrapāṇi, he is often characterised as being a product of a Buddhification of Herakles, but I don't see this anywhere in the textual references to him.

Malcolm wrote:
In the Pali canon, a figure named Vajrapāṇi is described as a yakṣa:

Now at that time the yakkha Thunderbolt-bearer, taking his iron thunderbolt which was aglow, ablaze, on fire, came to stand above the ground over Saccaka, the son of Jains, and said: “If this Saccaka, the son of Jains, does not answer when he is asked a legitimate question up to the third time by the Lord, verily I will make his skull split into seven pieces.”

https://legacy.suttacentral.net/en/mn35

Here we see Vajrapāṇi in his early role as dharmapāla. He is not, as some people erroneously claim, a form of Indra. Indra is never a yakṣa.

There is a continuity with this identification of Vajrapāṇi in lower tantras as Guhypati, lord of secrets,  meaning lord of the Guhyakas, a class of Yakṣas who live in the north. In Kriya tantra, for example, one notes that only Vajra family deities require secrecy in their practice.

Also in the tantras, Vajrapāṇi, in his form known as Bhūtaḍāmara, is also considered the general of the dharmapālas, as he was able to successfully subdue Yakṣa Mahākāla where Hayagriva was unable to do so (which may be throwing shade on Hayagriva as an important Vedic deity, a preserver of the Vedas), in the Buddhist version of the destruction of Tripura, which resulted from an epic class struggle between the asuras and devas.

Because otherwise, what need is there for formal
Sadhana practice at all?  I certainly don’t need to sit on a cushion and chant a cake recipe in order to visualize what the cake should look like and to take it through its beginning, middle, and completion stage. I just have to follow the recipe.

Malcolm wrote:
As I mentioned, sadhana recitation, for beginners, is a form of shamatha.  This is how it is presented by mahasiddha Padmavajra.

Yes, it’s a recipe, which has stages, etc., as well as precise bases of purification, purifiers, and results of purification.  For serious personal practice, a beginner should seek to do the middle length or long version of a sadhana. Sadhanas are not just “how fast can I get to the mantra”. Actually, mantra recitation is a post-equipoise practice, which generally comes AFTER the two stages, though thus not universal. The various stages in a sadhana, as mentioned above, have various specific functions related to purifying traces of the past life, conception, gestation, birth, and so on. They also epitomize the attainment of buddhahood in a single lifetime, from the initial thought of awakening to nonabiding nirvana, which normally takes three uncountable eons to achieve. So, there are important reasons to both understand the words and not rely on shorter sadhanas, as well as carefully reciting the words of the text so they trigger the appropriate visualization-clearly, quickly, and with focus. Short sadhanas do not have all these features, and are just for commitment maintenance, not liberation.

Malcolm wrote:
Where to begin. If you don’t know what the aggregates are, you do not understand what you are from a Buddhist point of view. At base you are mind/matter.

One of your aggregates is material, made of the five material sense organs and five material senses objects. It’s called the material aggregate.

The other four aggregates are consciousness and the mental factors.

The aggregates of mental factors are three: sensation, perception, and formations. Sensation is the mental factor of the sensations of pleasure, pain, happiness, sadness and indifference. Perception is the mental factor that coordinates discernment of one object from another. There are 51 mental factors in the aggregate of formations. That list can be sought elsewhere.

Consciousness, the knower, is the mental subject perceiving all this. That subject lacks all true identity, any identity it possesses is a mere, designated identity imputed on a false conceptual construct, I-am, which has no lore existence than an illusion. It’s present moment of cognition is nonconceptual, the handling of that immediate perception by mental factors is conceptual, both in terms of memory consciousness and speculative consciousness.

That’s it. That’s all you are. Five aggregates.

Level 3 is where with sufficient experience and understanding "certain elements are automatically performed and experienced rather than recited."

Does anyone have a sense of when and why this changed in Tibet?

I have doubts about a couple of things Malcolm has said, one factual and one more theoretical. Regarding Sogyal, he said that he:
did the retreats, etc.,
A close analysis of his known history, and his own claims about himself, strongly suggests not only that there was no time in his early life during which he could have undertaken more than light studies of the dharma, and there is no question of there being any years during which he could have undertaken a longer retreat (such as a three-year retreat). As far as I know, he didn't in any case claim to have done such a retreat, but if I'm wrong it would be interesting to know what exactly were the years in which this was supposed to have happened. He had a good English education, the gift of the gab, a pushy mother and a thirst for admiration. Poor lad!

Malcolm wrote:
Sogyal himself made no pretense towards being a ritual lama or of having done large amounts of retreat, though he did do long retreats, for example, a year long Kilaya retreat, etc in the 1990’s. He generally had other lamas give empowerments to,his students. CTR on the other hand definitely did retreats when he was quite young and in fact gave the entire Rinchen Terzod in Tibet while still a teenager. Many lamas in the Gelug and Sakya school never do three year retreats. It’s not a requirement.

The real question is who one trusts. Putting trust in organizations to perform due diligence seems perilous out of the gate. If one has already received transmission from ChNNR and understood the central point clearly, one can trust in that.  All that is left is practicing with confidence.

Malcolm wrote:
It's a continuum. The way one remembers past lives is that in a state of samadhi, one recalls events in reverse. Recollection of past lives is an abhijñā, not special to Buddhism. But it does depend on development of samadhi. For example, when you recall what happened to you 15 years ago, there is no actual presence of any of the events of 15 years ago. They all do not exist. You cannot say they are in your mind, nor can you deny your memory of them. Nor can you claim there is some entity that stayed in your mind which allows you to recall them. But you still recall some events from 15 years ago.

The same applies to past lives. The aggregates are serially connected, so there is some relationship with your past lives. Just the same, they do not exist now, and your ability to access those memories depends on your skill in samadhi, just as your abillity to recall past events in this life depends on your present mental clarity.

'nuff said.
The Madhyamakas reject is an unnecessary appendage, since all consciousnesses are just the aggregate of consciousness which is give different names when performing different functions. The reason it is rejected by Madhyamakas is that the yogacarins define the ālaya as a consciousness that engages in no processes of perception. Nāgārjuna II, in the Bodhicittavivarana equates the yogacāra theory with a magnet that just blinding attracts iron fillings. Jayānanda, in his commentary on Candra's Intro to the Middle Way has a novel take on ālayavijñāna that I have mentioned before. He states that the actual ālaya, the storehouse, if you will, is emptiness, and the vijñāna is what perceives it, hence the term ālayavijñāna properly understood, would mean "the consciousness that apprehends emptiness." This is very close to the meaning of mahāmudra and dzogchen when they talk of the dhātu and jñāna/vidya being inseparable.

No, but he was the only person who had a publisher/book store owner as one of his students. CTR's relationship with Sam Bercholz, more than any other single factor, was responsible for his swift rise and success in opening Dharma centers throughout North America. He founded Vajradhātu in 1973, the same year his first major book came out, Cutting Through Spiritual Materialism. Indeed, it was among the first books on Buddhism I ever read, along with  Myth of Freedom, Three Pillars of Zen, Zen Mind Beginners Mind, Zen Bones, Zen Flesh, etc. in 1978. By the time I went to work in bookstore owned by member of Vajradhātu, Trident Books in Boston, in 1987. The Regent scandal was in the making, since Trungpa had died earlier that year. I never did join the local Dharmadhātu. I did do a couple of Shambhala levels, but found the teachers that I encountered in that program extremely unimpressive and pompous. There were also clear problems with rampant sexual harassment of new female students and wide-spread alcoholism in that sangha.

It means that the aggregates are a continuous steam of momentary events, the preceding moment being the cause of the next, hence they are serially connected. This is stated quite clearly by Nāgārjuna in the Verses on Dependent Origination. He writes:

6)	Although the aggregates are serially connected,
the wise are to comprehend nothing has transfers.

Therein, the aggregates are the aggregates of matter, sensation, perception, formations, and consciousness. Those, called ‘serially joined’, not having ceased, produce another produced from that cause; although not even the subtle atom of an existent has transmigrated from this world to the next.

In Jodo Shu Buddhism, one approaches the matter of fulfilling this Mahayana Vow through the Three Minds and Four Modes of Practice, which center around Amida Buddha.
Those who make this heartfelt aspiration for the bodhisattva way Will be free of all lower rebirths,
Free of harmful companions,
And will quickly see Amitabha, Infinite Light.

............................

When the moment of my death arrives,
By eliminating all obscurations
And directly perceiving Amitabha,
May I go immediately to Sukhavati, Pure Land of Great Joy.

Having gone to Sukhavati,
May I actualize the meaning of these aspirations,
Fulfilling them all without exception,
For the benefit of beings for as long as this world endures.
Born from an extremely beautiful, superlative lotus In this joyful land,
the Buddha’s magnificent mandala,
May I receive a prediction of my awakening
Directly from the Buddha Amitabha.

..............................................

Through creating limitless positive potential
By dedicating this prayer of Samantabhadra’s deeds,
May all beings drowning in this torrent of suffering,
Enter the presence of Amitabha.

Through this king of aspirations, which is the greatest of the sublime,
Helping infinite wanderers in samsara,
Through the accomplishment of this scripture dazzling with
Samantabhadra’s practice,
May suffering realms be utterly emptied of all beings

Climate refugees are already a thing from Africa and Central America. The US and Western Europe are going through fits of authoritarianism because of the fact that people are on the move, and more of them will be on the move for the next 500 years and no one is preparing for that. Syria, for example, is a directly result of climate change. The Arab Spring was originally caused by farmers protesting water shortages. It then turned into a civil war. Much the same thing will happen in the Western US, especially with lunatics like the Bundys. Water wars used to be common in the 19th century, with feuds between farmers and ranchers. This is why there is a complicated water allocations in CA and other western states which are now being upended. It all looks pretty grim to me.

It's mentioned in the Perfection of Wisdom Sutra, Maha Prajna Paramita. I share your misgivings. But there it is.

Malcolm wrote:
No, the term "true self" is not used in any Prajñāpāramita sūtra.

One interpretation could be that there is a trend in Mahayana to speak in positives, even though it is controversial since it could mislead some people.

Supramundane said:
Remember that, although the Buddha rejected an eternal self, he never advocated no self.

Malcolm wrote:
False.


Supramundane said:
The middle way is in between, and I think that's what is meant by the True Self in this sutra: the correct conception of self, which is in between the eternal and the nihilistic.

Malcolm wrote:
Not, this is not correct. There is nothing in the middle which can be termed "a self," true or otherwise.


Supramundane said:
But usually Buddhism expresses itself in terms of negations --- not negatives--- but negations. And thus true self is controversial, but we do see it in certain sutras where Buddhahood is spoken as a 'womb' or an 'embryo'.

Malcolm wrote:
No, there we just see the term "self" used. How? As in the Uttaratantra commentary by Asanga, the term ātmapāramitā refers to a kind of two fold purity: freedom from the taint of general and specific characteristics, posited as freedom from the eternalist atman of nonbuddhists and the annihilationist anatman of śrāvakayānists.

And no, tathāgatagarbha is not "buddhahood." For example, the Lanka equates it with the ālayavijñana.

Supramundane said:
If we speak of it as a womb, it is pure potential, but if we speak of it as an embryo, that means that there is something there. It is a positive.

Malcolm wrote:
No, there isn't anything "there."

Supramundane said:
I think that if we are careful in judicious, it's okay to speak in positives, such as true self and true mind as opposed to false self and false mind.

Malcolm wrote:
All concepts of self are false imputations.

Supramundane said:
In the Surangama sutra --- one which you quote frequently and one which I believe you are currently reading, my friend --- I hate to tell you, but there are 149 references to true mind, true eternity, true bliss, true purity, and yes, true self. Do not mistake true with eternal, however. As I stated above, I believe 'true' refers more to a true conception of self, i.e. a non-self.

Malcolm wrote:
I don't accept that this is a valid sūtra. It is a Chinese pastiche.


Supramundane said:
The other sutras which refer to Buddhanature in the positive are the Platform Sutra, the Queen Srimālā of the Lion's Roar Sutra, the Sutra of Complete Enlightenment, Mahaparanirvana Sutra, among others.

Malcolm wrote:
The Platform Sūtra is not a sūtra.

Nevetheless, the second turning of the wheel is definitive, not the third. This is easily proven through both scripture and reasoning.

With respect to the tathāgatagarbha doctrine, if understood correctly, it can be understood as definitive, understood as you have presented it above, "If we speak of it as a womb, it is pure potential, but if we speak of it as an embryo, that means that there is something there. It is a positive," this is just eternalism, not better than the Hindu concept of self. So no.

Shambhala has little to do with the traditional teachings of the Trungpa lineage and even though some members (and former members like Pema Chodron) practise within the Kagyu tradition to some degree, I think they are their own thing. So while it is good that Shambhala help with some money, their interest is not really with the Trungpa lineage so much as with the teachings specific to the 11th Trungpa. Whether the current Trungpa will take any of those up, we wait to see. I cannot imagine him though requesting a lineage transmission from Osel Mukpo the current holder though, so it's probably unlikely.

Sentient beings don't have an ego/self that is travelling from one life to an other, this is a basic buddhist teaching. The self is an illusion. Tulkus supposedly don't really have even the illusion of a self their actions are a reflection of their circumstances.

2. Do all modern schools of Mahayana Buddhism allow Buddhists, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas to believe that other people consist of skandhas such as form, sensations, perceptions, mental activity or formations and consciousness, or are only Buddhists who have not yet come to enlightenment allowed to believe in it?

It remains for each individual to work out their spiritual path -  with diligence.

Malcolm wrote:
In any case, the whole principle of hereditary lineages is unworkable and not what the Buddha intended at all:

1. Now the Blessed One spoke to the Venerable Ananda, saying: "It may be, Ananda, that to some among you the thought will come: 'Ended is the word of the Master; we have a Master no longer.' But it should not, Ananda, be so considered. For that which I have proclaimed and made known as the Dhamma and the Discipline, that shall be your Master when I am gone.
https://accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn ... .vaji.html

So it is at present. The method of how to find a teacher and rely on a teacher exists in the sutras and tantras of the Buddha. The words of our teacher, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu are fully in accordance with the words of sūtra and tantra, and there is no contradiction with them at all.

The institutional paralysis of the DC will eventually pass, or not, but even if ChNN's direct lineage dies out, his mark on the world will be noted. Fortunately, there are sufficient numbers of people out there who can properly pass on the essence of the Dzogchen teachings.

And with any teacher of course, caveat emptor. There are many people out there who show a deer tail, but sell horse meat. Every teacher needs to be examined, as does every student.

In general, people should not practice thogal until they have understood the view, khregs chod, and stabilized it very firmly.

"Skinhead" was a fashion, which ultimately came from merging the hard mod fashion with Jamaican Rude Boy fashion in the late 60's. To be a skinhead required that you wore the right gear, levis, eight or ten-eyelet DMS, skinny braces, Fred Perry, etc., and importantly, football! It started here because people liked the look of Selector, the Specials, Madness, and so on. Then Oi! started getting promoted first in England, then here.

I was a skinhead in the early 80's, because of Ska music and Oi!. I played in a reggae band in Boston, etc. I saw the whole scene go to shit because of the white power assholes, circa 1982 onward. Plus Skinhead fashion was cool in the Industrial Music scene, and that did lead some people into neonationalist territory, like Death in June, etc. West coast punks with leather jackets and Frye motorcycle books were something else, same with Minor Threat, who wore sneakers for lord's sake. And even if these US punks had DM's, they generally never knew how to lace them properly, so they looked pretty clueless.

I abandoned that fashion completely in 1985 when I saw a ten year old on a skateboard dressed exactly like me.  But it was a good look and since I was working in food service the whole time, from 1980-1986 or so, it served me well.

They seem quite distinct to me, even though they are not labelled as such. Whenever there is a mandala built gradually from the elements etc., you have Mahayoga. Some sadhanas even speak of "Mahamudra" at the end. When you have instant manifestation, usually it means Anuyoga.

Malcolm wrote:
Anuyoga has two systems: one gradual, one instant. Mahāmudra in Nyingma does not mean the same thing as mahāmudra in the gsar ma tantras. But in any case, ChNN affirmed countless times that the result of the two stages and the result of Dzogchen were the same.

tinylocusta said:
As to the tradition of practicing the three inner tantras together, it is omnipresent in Nyingma. Yes, the Nyinghtigs exist, but they are always being practiced in the context of Vajrayana, and some of them have more Mahayoga than Anuyoga.

Malcolm wrote:
And in Dzogchen Community. For example, the medium thun, which combines the system of Mahāyoga with the system of Anuyoga and the system of Atiyoga.

You are confusing "Nying thig," like klong chen snying thig as a fashionable name, with the term snying thig, for example Vima snying thig, which is strictly about the utterly secret unsurpassed cycle of the man ngag sde tantras. They are not the same thing at all.

Malcolm wrote:
You are free to take anyone you like as a teacher, and devotionally capitalizing the indefinite pronouns when referencing them. It's fine with me. Weird to do so, but whatever.

We don't need to speculate. Yeshe made his attitude towards the broader community, as well as Buddhadharma, clear as a bell.

The criteria for following a teacher are clearly laid out in the Dzogchen tantras and elsewhere. ChNN hit every one of those marks. Why would I need another teacher? ChNN was a perfect teacher, who I studied and practiced under for 26 years. I don't need another Dzogchen teacher in this life, other than the ones I already have studied with. You have a different idea, and that is your choice. No one is criticizing you or anyone else, or and telling you or anyone else that you or anyone else cannot take Yeshe as a guru. That's strictly between you and him. Any criticism offered to you here concern your  deficiencies of learning, evident in your bombastic pronouncements and misstatements of fact.

My aim writing here was to ask people to reflect before using offensive words against Him. I had honestly thought these were accidental and that people would reflect and adjust their attitude.

Or worse, maybe provoked even more slander.

Malcolm wrote:
There is no slander here. No one is saying that Yeshe is a bad or evil person, or that by choosing to leave the community he did something inherently wrong. His actions certainly confuse a lot of people. But he is just an ordinary person in a human body with human problems, just like everyone else. Some people are disappointed he did not don the mantle. Personally, I could care less. But I do think his little dance with the community is harming the community, and that he ought to be in or be out, rather than one foot in the door and one foot out.

I do not think that it is correct to say that Rinpoche presented Dzogchen as a complete self-contained path, fullstop.

Malcolm wrote:
If he did, he would have only presented trekcho and thogal, following empowerment. In fact, he mostly focused on trekcho, and only _very_ rarely did he teach thogal.

What ChNN understood, finally, from Changchub Dorje was the meaning of the teaching on the basis (gzhi) a.k.a the primordial state a.k.a the nature of one's own mind, in Dzogchen. That was the topic that had eluded ChNN in his previous studies and teachings he had received. If one does not understand the Dzogchen teaching on the basis, one cannot understand the Dzogchen path.

This is why he taught the way _all_ Nyingma teachers do, extensively teaching on gzhi khregs chod combined with anuyoga transformation practices until people are ready to practice the path, lhun grub thogal, which almost no one does seriously. In this respect he was very traditional. He also tried to explain to people that the unelaborate path of Dzogchen, of the Nyinthig teachings, the utterly secret unsurpassed cycle, was beyond the nine yānas, a fact stated in the seventeen tantras themselves as well as all major Nyinthig cycles, and countless commentaries. In fact, ChNN taught Dzogchen in an utterly traditional way, as anyone who has extensively studied the length and breadth of Dzogchen teachings knows, and has not fallen for the bullshit propaganda some people in DC repeatedly drone, which mainly derives from an incorrect understanding of the Kun byed rGyal po and other sems sde texts. ChNN repeatedly stated that sems sde concerned the teaching on the basis, and that in essence, it was about khregs chod. If one does not understand that basis, one can do Ati guru yoga and sing the SOV until the cows come home, but it isn't really Dzogchen practice. Authentic teachers of Dzogchen spend years emphasizing the teaching on the basis to their students until they get it right. ChNN was exactly that kind of teacher.

Rather than being angry at the students his father surrounded himself with and to whom he dedicated his life, Yeshe should direct his unhappiness at its true source.

Other teachers have never done that. They were focused on preserving the totality of Buddha's teaching as presented in their tradition, starting with Vinaya (+presenting Tibetan "folklore", seeing it being destroyed and dying out).

The second - related - was aiming not only at "spiritual people", but the general population. This was not the case in Tibet: Dzogchen was often closely guarded and not taught openly, given only after a long training etc. Giving it openly is a recent phenomenon.

Malcolm wrote:
False, it was one of the most widespread and easily available teachings in Tibet. There are more manuals on Dzogchen than any other single teaching.

False. Many people have discovered the nature of their mind, and yet they still continue to take rebirth.

You should really properly educate yourself before you continue to make yourself look ignorant.

The reality is that people have opinions, some people are threatened by those opinions, and make samaya threats, etc., forgetting that they are just imposing limitations on other people, trying to shut down uncomfortable conversations.

Now, there are certain natural limitations, like for example the one that says that one has to have a living teacher to enter secret mantra, and so on. That's one teacher has to measure up to certain qualifications to be a teacher. And the fact that these days, a perfect teacher is almost impossible to find.

There are so many things people are confused about here. A simple example: the empowerments for the three inner tantras mentioned in the Precious Vase. When you read that fragment it is clear it is for people following the SMS training, and during this training there is something to learn about each of these.

Malcolm wrote:
And Rinpoche made it very clear that everyone in the DC is to follow the base of SMS. So then?

tinylocusta said:
As entering the way of Mantra without receiving an initiation is negative, of course.

Malcolm wrote:
Dzogchen is part of Mantra. Without empowerment, no Dzogchen. You want citations? I can give you many.

The sgra thal 'gyur is the gold standard here, and the sgral thal 'gyur insists that empowerment, samaya, etc., are all important. So does Longchenpa, which Rinpoche held up as the gold standard of Tibetan masters, no merely once, but many times.

tinylocusta said:
Rinpoche describes it and gives some alternatives for people who can't do that. It is perfectly normal. The suggestion that what Rinpoche was giving to everybody for His whole life works only if you are extremely lucky and that now people should flock to other teachers to receive Dupa Do and Guhyagarbha makes no sense!

Malcolm wrote:
Since Rinpoche never gave the Guhyagarbha or long Anuyoga empowerment, his suggestion that people should receive then could only mean that people should seek out qualified teachers elsewhere, and receive them.

tinylocusta said:
(btw when you go to Blye [???} to receive Guhyagarbha you may want to ask earlier if you receive the whole thing, because normally it's given in parts.)

Malcolm wrote:
It takes three days.

tinylocusta said:
Such statements are in direct contradiction to what He was teaching.

Malcolm wrote:
No, they are not.

tinylocusta said:
Instead of receiving these initiations, people who haven't woken up should repeat what they received and sing the SoV. Of course if someone is doing SMS and studies the three inner tantras, that's a different thing.

Malcolm wrote:
So now you are in a position to tell people what they ought and ought not do? You are just an anonymous voice on the internet, hiding behind a nym. If you had any courage whatsoever, you would post in your real name.

Some things seem to be said just for the sake of being said, I see no other reason. For example that people don't understand the qualifications of the teacher because they prefer to party...

Malcolm wrote:
There are a lot of people in the DC who have been following Rinpoche for years, who still know nothing. It's not his fault. But it's good they have faith in him. At least that much will gain them birth in a dharma family in their next life.

tinylocusta said:
Anyone who follows SMS is well aware of these things, regardless of their leisure preferences. In the Precious Vase Rinpoche quotes several pages about the necessary qualifications of teachers from Adzom Drugpa and Patrul Rinpoche.

Malcolm wrote:
And people never read these things. Or if they read them, they forget them, and so on.

tinylocusta said:
There are many more false things written here but I feel like I would act wrongly by discussing them.



Malcolm wrote:
Then your remarks are kind of pointless, no?

tinylocusta said:
Also, for everything I've written above you can easily find 10 counter-arguments and discuss these ad nauseam. I have no interest in these kinds of discussions; what I'm asking you - that is people blaming everybody outside - to reflect a bit how much of it is a projection of your minds and how beneficial or harmful are the things you write here.

"Danny Boyle has revealed he's working on a follow-up to 28 Days Later.

The director told The Independent that a third film is in the works with Ex Machina filmmaker Alex Garland, who wrote the 2002 original.

"Alex Garland and I have a wonderful idea for the third part," he said. "It's properly good."

He continued: "The original film led to a bit of a resurgence in the zombie drama and it doesn't reference any of that. It doesn't feel stale at all. He's concentrating on directing his own work at the moment, so it's stood in abeyance really, but it's a you-never-know."

Sequel 28 Weeks Later, directed by Juan Carlos Fresnadillo, was released in 2007.
The question of "does a philosophical zombie have buddha nature" is an interesting challenge though.

If someone has received the empowerments, done the retreats and the study and has the necessary level of realization (which is obviously difficult, that’s true with any teacher right?) then they are qualified to pass on the teachings.
Is that not right?

Malcolm wrote:
Its not a modern innovation, per se, but the fact is that most people who start teaching do so when their guru passes away, and usually, to preserve the lineage, not promote themselves. It is ideal if one receives permission from one of one's gurus to teach. It is not necessary to receive permission from each and every one, however. Tulkus kind of have permission built in.

DIRECT TRANSMISSION
(...)

mutsuk said:
Ok, so this means direct introduction (ngo sprod). If you attended a teaching (webcast or live) during which the DI was given you have received that transmission but understanding it is different. I read somewhere some DC people saying stuff like "Oh I was there, he gave it, but actually I did not received it" and things like that. Sorry but this is nonsense. The DI is about understanding the nature of the mind. It is easy to understand if you don't expect a magic trick that is going to make you a Buddha right away because understanding Rigpa has never liberated anyone on the spot. So during DI what you should expect is to have a clear understanding of the Emptiness-Clarity of your mind. This understanding is the knowledge (rig-pa) of the natural state. Again, if you don't project unrelated expectations on this,  then it is very easy to understand. In a sense, you cannot "not have received it", in particular since Rinpoche gave it in a very clear and simple way. However, to transmit that DI yourself, you need to have your understanding of it validated by the master and then obtain his formal authorization.

Malcolm wrote:
These are actually Donwangs. They originally fell on the birth anniversaries of Garab Dorje, Guru P and Adzom Drukpa, and on these days we would do gurus yogas at the time of their birth. Then, ChNN switched giving to empowerments of Garab Dorje and Padmasambhava coordinated by video on these dates, and then finally, web casts.

So I am proposing a new Dzogchen Community based on the Teachings of ChNN, with the spirit of ChNN being the living Teacher.

Through dreams, visions, and praying with strong faith, many have taken Transmission from Teachers who are no longer in their body.

I think that this will work for many practitioners - both old and new.  If someone claims that they have received a Transmission / permission from ChNN how can anyone say that they did not.  This is an entirely subjective experience. So certainly this works (or should work) for SSF to allow the purchase of practice materials and to allow the replay of recorded material.

I also want to add, that the qualifications of who can teach Dzogchen are very specifically spelled out by Longchenpa in texts such as the Treasury of the Dharmadhātu, its commentary, based in authoritative Dzogchen Tantra like the Kun byed rgyal po, etc. One has to know how to give empowerments, understand secret mantra in general, have done the retreats, be skilled in the views of the various yānas, be able to answer questions, etc., etc. Its not sufficient to make a loud noise, like scaring a flock of pigeons.

Well, as far as I know, there is basically no one in the community right now, apart from Adriano, who actually has the necessary skills in Tibetan and English to give empowerments.  It is simply not enough to copy the meaning empowerments (don dbangs) Rinpoche used to give, let along the more complicated empowerments such as Longsal empowerment, or the empowerments for SMS, etc.. One has to be scholarly enough to know how to read the texts. Many people imagine that a direct introduction is enough. It may be for a few people with fantastic past life accumulations, but for most people it is not sufficient. This is why Rinpoche recommended that SMS people receive the Guhyagarbha, an Anuyoga empowerment in concise or long form, and the Khandro Nyinthig empowerment.

There are really an endless source of issues here that cannot be addressed in any comprehensive way by the IDC, and they have made it clear that there is nothing they can do.

No, that's just not correct to the best of my knowledge. New Zealand pretty much admitted it will be endemic now, and they were on super lockdown. The r0 of delta makes endemicity almost a given, without a 100% vaccine, which AFAIK is pretty much impossible with this kind of virus. None of the places that did heavy lockdowns are faring well with Delta, for the reasons I've mentioned, and the fact that they were late to the vaccination party. The UK is doing ok due to the vaccination rate. The places with no immunity (via natural infection and vaccines) are in the worst position following heavy lockdowns. That's of course not an argument for people going out and catching Covid - the dramatic drop in the risk of severe disease and death is the part of the vaccines that is most important, and taking on Covid without being vaccinated is a real crapshoot, one where the dice are more loaded the older one is.

In all seriousness though, the water table in the Central Valley has dropped fifty feet in the past 70 years or so (thanks to irrigation), and the infrastructure has suffered badly for it. California cannot sustain the number of people living there, and no, you can't have the Great Lakes... You'll have to drain Lake Tahoe first, at the very least. "This land is my land, this is land is your land" stuff went out with Trump.

Expect the US to split into four major regions in the next 100 years.

I think it must be meaningful that enlightenment and Nirvana are not mentioned at all in the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.

Malcolm wrote:
Nirodha and nirvana are synonyms.

So you have suffering, its source, and its cessation. These are not prescriptive terms, they are diagnostic terms. Then there is the eight fold path, which is prescriptive.

Awakening means recognizing these four things as truths. When one is not an ārya, these are the mundane four truths. When one has realized them through direct knowledge, they are the ārya's four truths:

Supramundane said:
"And, monks, as long as this knowledge & vision of mine — with its three rounds & twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are present — was not pure, I did not claim to have directly awakened to the right self-awakening unexcelled in the cosmos with its devas, Maras, & Brahmas, with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & commonfolk. But as soon as this knowledge & vision of mine — with its three rounds & twelve permutations concerning these four noble truths as they actually are present — was truly pure, then I did claim to have directly awakened to the right self-awakening unexcelled in the cosmos with its devas, Maras & Brahmas, with its contemplatives & brahmans, its royalty & commonfolk. Knowledge & vision arose in me: 'Unprovoked is my release. This is the last birth. There is now no further becoming.'"

As seen on Twitter:





Hello everyone, and welcome to this meeting of the Florida GOP Committee on Health Policy. We're meeting today in this parking lot behind a Hooter's because Dale, our treasurer, died of COVID-19 last night and he had sole access to the accounts, so we couldn't rent out our usual conference room space in the Best Western. Apologies for any inconvenience and thoughts and prayers to Dale's family members who have not also died of COVID-19.

My name is Tad Horkington, and I'm honored to have been named president of the committee following the tragic death of Thomas Bilgenut, the interim president who last week died of COVID-19. Tom had, of course, replaced Hugh Frank, our previous president who died two weeks ago of COVID-19, along with his entire family and the youth football team he coached.

We will not read minutes from last month's meeting, as our committee secretary, Henry Sanford is presently hospitalized with COVID-19. We wish him and his loved ones well, send our thoughts and prayers and commend his courageous work on the "MASKS ARE TYRANNY!" float that appeared in the Labor Day parade in Vero Beach. Hopefully we can honor Henry and his team at our next meeting, assuming they are all off their ventilators or out of quarantine.

Getting to business, we need to sign off on the anti-vaccine-mandate statement that was put together by Belinda Thompson prior to her death from COVID-19. Thoughts and prayers to Belinda's family, all of whom were infected by Belinda at the vaccine protest she organized in a sealed tent outside the Granada Plaza Publix in Dunedin.

The statement, which Belinda composed using her iPhone's voice dictation feature, reads: "The Florida GOP Committee on Health Policy hereby denounces Sleepy Joe Biden's TYRANNICAL attempt to COUGH mandate vaccines for anyone COUGH anywhere or at any COUGH time. We encourage all righteous COUGH Americans to stand up against this COUGH COUGH COUGH unlawful government overreach." I would propose we vote to approve that statement, but unfortunately, due to COVID-19 illnesses we do not have a quorum and, in fact, I am the only person in attendance today, and even I barely made it as I'm feeling a little under the weather. Jan Dodson, who is the only committee officer allowed to change the rules on voting, is unfortunately visiting her husband Zeke who is in Tampa General Hospital's COVID ward. They won't let her in because she patriotically refuses to wear a mask, so kudos to Jan for standing in the parking lot holding a sign that reads "STAY STRONG, ZEKE AND DON'T LET THEM MICROCHIP YOU!!"

COUGH! Excuse me. I'm sure it's just a cold. I will now conclude this meeting of the Florida GOP Committee on Health Policy. COUGH! I feel a bit feverish, so I'm going to go into the Hooter's without a mask and get a beer and some wings. God bless America.

I should also point out a few things as well:

1. The monks themselves evidently don't take the mythology too literally - they demonstrate that the Ancient Indians believed the whole world consisted of the Subcontinent of India and nothing else - something obviously not true. Moreover, in their later video on the "Northern Continent", they use two completely contradictory sources in elaborating what the "Northern Continent" is, and these two sources seem unreconcilable - one source describes the Northern Continent as some kind of Utopian post-agricultural-revolution Garden of Eden, another source describes it as a realm of floating cities where Yakas (Demonic Ogres) have slave ownership over human beings (perhaps, soteriologically, the two sources aren't so unreconcilable when you look at something like the Soviet Union, or, more pertinently, Mao China)

Malcolm wrote:
Uttarakuru is the northern steppes, and also Ptolemy refers to people there are "Kurus." So this ancient geography was shared between the Occident and Orient.

And Its pretty clear that this was a typological cosmology, treated differently in different sources, which Indian Buddhists in the classical period would have been familiar.

Anyway - probably not an important thing to fixate on, and one's natural inclinations and experiences will undoubtedly vary, but carefully tailoring physical supports to one's practices can lend the latter strength.

Regarding yak bones - the mala I was looking at is painted red, with brass inlay. The color and general vibe seemed right, and you wouldn't necessarily realize it's bone just by looking at it. But I'm going to hold off on this one, I think, due to the wrathful associations.

The Man Behind Critical Race Theory
How Derrick Bell’s pioneering work gave rise to critical race theory.
Read in The New Yorker: https://apple.news/AqOnqIwHvSZS1XWSjwBAkig

Unknown said:
For the past several months, however, conservatives have been waging war on a wide-ranging set of claims that they wrongly ascribe to critical race theory, while barely mentioning the body of scholarship behind it or even Bell’s name. As Christopher F. Rufo, an activist who launched the recent crusade, said on Twitter, the goal from the start was to distort the idea into an absurdist touchstone. “We have successfully frozen their brand—‘critical race theory’—into the public conversation and are steadily driving up negative perceptions. We will eventually turn it toxic, as we put all of the various cultural insanities under that brand category,” he wrote. Accordingly, C.R.T. has been defined as Black-supremacist racism, false history, and the terrible apotheosis of wokeness. Patricia Williams, one of the key scholars of the C.R.T. canon, refers to the ongoing mischaracterization as “definitional theft.”
