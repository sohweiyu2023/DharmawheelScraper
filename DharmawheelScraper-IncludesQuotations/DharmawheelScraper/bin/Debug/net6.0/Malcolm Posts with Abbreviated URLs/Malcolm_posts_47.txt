ChNN. At least once per teaching I've found that Namkhai Norbu endorses eating meat, and as Malcolm mentioned, also chastised practitioners like me who refuse to do so, hence my post above.

Malcolm wrote:
You have to understand one critical point: ChNN states that if, for example, you are a common Mahāyāna practitioner, then of course you must be a vegetarian. But if you are a Vajrayāna practitioner, than you have methods available to you to benefit sentient beings which wind up on your plate, either as a byproduct of agriculture, or as a consequence of slaughter. To refuse to use those methods and prefer a lower sutrayāna view makes your compassion "miserable."

The idea that you can only eat meat if you have the capacity to transfer the animal's consciousness to a buddhafield is a superstition.

Malcolm wrote:
Obsession about which food is pure and which food is not belongs to Muslims, Jews, Jains, and Hindus. It is not, and never really has been, a major Buddhist concern. Why? Because liberation is not dependent on one's diet. It is also not dependent on ritual purity, the observance of ethics, etc.

ThoroughlyCutting said:
It's not a matter of pure and impure: those are just concepts - and I'm not obsessed, I'm concerned. It's a matter of looking at the needless suffering endured by others, particularly in (but not limited to) the modern context of mass industrialized farming practices, and knowing that by mere passive non engagement with it one is helping to retard the continued growth of that industry. This is the world we live in, so as bodhisattvas it seems imperitive that we do our part to make it better, no? Of course I'm not trying to make a dogmatic statement: for those who have the realization to help others by consuming their flesh, that's a skillful means. Examination of motivation is key to the whole enterprise of Dharma, as I understand it. Liberation is predicated upon recognition of the natural state, the relative expression of which is boundless compassion and wisdom, according to my teachers and what I've read, and there seems to be no contradiction between that and living as ethically and mindfully as possible - one of the results of which is, after one has examined the source one's food, to limit as much as possible the damage done by its cultivation. I doubt very much that I'm mistaken in this, but please let me know if i can refine my thinking.

Also, why is the comment about the requirement of a high degree of realization incorrect?

Malcolm wrote:
We can try and correct samsara, but we won't succeed.

We try to observe ahimsa, non-harming, as much as possible. As Bhavaviveka points out, one cannot harm a sentient being who is already dead. Therefore, eating meat causes no suffering, just as eating bread causes no suffering, provided that you did not slaughter the animal yourself, etc. All the various themes about this have been hashed out in this thread long ago.

The reason your statement is incorrect is simply that it is. There are many methods one can use to create a good cause for a given sentient being that do not require one to be a first stage bodhisattva on up.

Or:
And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put to death.
Or in other books of the OT:
If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her ... and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her, I found her not a maid: Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the elders of the city in the gate: And the damsel's father shall say ... these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the cloth before the elders of the city. ... But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel: Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die.
Or:
They found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day. ... And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones.... And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded Moses.

Hi all,

I am working through Mipham's commentary on Padmasambhava's Garland of Views right now and I came across this passage: The Bodhisattva Vehicle takes its name from its cause. Its result is no different from that of the secret mantras, so both the Mantra Vehicle and the vehicle of the transcendent perfections constitute the same Great Vehicle.
To be clear, the text presents the Great Perfection as falling under the category of the Mantra Vehicle. I am taken aback by this passage, because I thought the 13th and 16th bhumi, especially the Rainbow Body of Great Transference, was a different result than sutra Buddhahood. I've heard before that the Rainbow Body implies more capacity for emanations than other kinds of Buddhahood, but I can't say I've heard that from a source as definitive as Mipham here. So, can anyone help to clarify?

Thanks

We should keep this definition in mind when we are discussing politics, because the attachments and aversions implicit in hatred can be a real trap we may not notice.

Who said anything about "destiny". The reality of Dharma is that if you have no connection to the teachings, you won't find them. If you have a connection to the teachings, you won't be able to avoid them. This is just a question of samskara and punya. The teachers that came here spoke to those who were interested. They did not climb on soapboxes to proselytize. Did we appear in the West in conjunction with the teachers who brought the teachings here? Obviously. If someone is interested, we must teach them to whatever capacity we have. If they aren't interested, we should really keep our mouths shut.

How exactly does tendency toward enlightenment start? Where does the accumulation of merit commence? Can you categorically say it does not start with outreach?

Malcolm wrote:
The tendency towards awakening begins with the wish to escape suffering. The accumulation of merit begins when you wish others to escape suffering before you yourself escape suffering, just as when, under an ancient Śakyamuni, the being who eventually became our Śakyamuni wished that the guardians of hell torment him rather than the other beings in the hell realms.

Of course, any being who avoids the ten natural nonvirtues is accumulating (transient) merit as well.

Dzogchen is a direct perception. Guru Yoga is a way of entering that direct perception.

Going by Malcolm's logic, one could even say that all paths have a 100% success rate, if you allow for enough time. Because over an infinite time scale, all possible events will occur an infinite number of times.

A better way to judge teachings than based upon the words of another, are to compare the average "good student" to see which have developed the Enlightenment factors prescribed by the Buddha. This should at least tell you enough about a lineage before jumping in to determine if you will really be heading in the right direction.

By this logic, one can tell that many lineages do indeed head in the right direction, even if the aspirants all argue over whose methods are better at leading people to enlightenment, and what bodhi really even means.

Yet, they all have certainly received such empowerments as Shitro, Amitabha, various forms of Guru Rinpoche, etc., all of which are essentially practices grounded in Dzogchen view, meditation and practice, as is the Karma Pakshi Ladrub.

I understand that given the close connection between Nyingma and Karma Kagyu, sometimes it is a struggle for Karma Kagyu to maintain its separate identity. It is no secret, for example, that Kongtrul's own personal practice was Dzogchen, specifically based around the Konchog Chidu cycle.

dzoki said:
I think it is quite far fetched to say that most of Karma Kagyu practices are termas. Most of daily practices are certainly not terma, also what is practiced in retreat is mostly Karma Kagyu compositions and not terma.

As for dzogchen, most of Karma Kagyupa´s that I have met consider mahamudra and dzogchen to be equal, their reasoning is that there is no higher state than the natural state of mind, which is the state of mahamudra and dzogchen, so in their view there is no difference between the two (when it comes to one being higher and the other being lower).

Malcolm wrote:
Oh, there is a very funny interaction between Kalu Rinpoche and Dudjom Rinpoche over this very question, with Dudjom Rinpoche pointing out that all of Kalu RInpoche's own daily practices were in fact from the terma tradition.

I don't know about other centers, but at KTD, which is in Woodstock, NY, most of the daily practice are termas. And just look at their catalogue of publications:

http://www.kagyu.org/ktdpub/catalog/web/viewer.html

and,

http://www.namsebangdzo.com/Pecha_s/2548.htm

Absolutely most of the daily practices they sell on their website are termas.

Their three year retreat program is a different thing, but of course, the Karma Pakshi Guru Sadhana is a major thing, yet another terma.

Content:
Jeff H said:
I have a dilemma which concerns an unmentionable and controversial teacher. This is not a question about that group, but about my actions now, as an FPMT practitioner. The issue arose for me when I was listening to Alex Berzin’s lectures on Wheel of Sharp Weapons. At one point he mentions the questionable teacher by name and said, “I would not have one of his books in my house.” The reason, as I understand it, is a based on samaya toward HHDL and the idea that anything associated with that school has the potential to produce negative energy.

So here’s my dilemma. It was that school that introduced me to Tibetan Buddhism in 2007. I attended weekly sessions for two years, but more significantly, during that time I studied all his texts designated as the Foundational Programme on my own. My entire experience there was very positive. I was never taught about their protector and never encouraged to protest HHDL.

Most importantly, I believe that this teacher’s texts gave me a very solid grounding in Gelug teachings. When I left that school for Geshe Tashi Tsering’s formal, online course called Foundations of Buddhist Thought, I found it was essentially the same curriculum, and I believe that I was able to get more out of Geshe Tashi’s teachings thanks to the preliminary work I had done.

Therefore, although I accepted my first teacher wrongly, and subsequently came to believe I should respectfully disassociate myself from him, I retain a certain loyalty because, in fact, I believe he taught me well. More significantly, I still possess all the books I studied in those first two years, and I consider them to be legitimate Dharma teachings. So if I am to get rid of them, how should I do that?

Vajrasvapna said:
Is Cult like nature of Tibetan Buddhism acceptable? Could we have a less fanatic teacher disciple relation? Since what I'm seeing in Tibetans Buddhism groups is just too ugly and the guru thing is what people use to support that.

Some quotes about that:

"In Europe and America, Tibetan teachers emphasized that to follow Guru is very important ... like that. Yes, in the essence of Tantra, Guru is important. But in this case, you need certain quality of Guru, and certain quality of disciples ... with comparison to Milarepa and Marpa. And then subject Tantra, the nature of the Tantra, the nature of the Guru, and the nature of the disciple, must be in a very proper structure. But Tantra is a very eccentric practice. It was a very eccentric practice as in the examples of Tilopa/Naropa and Marpa/Milarepa. Of course, Tantric methods is very powerful but this is not suitable for big society. A teacher like Marpa and Tilopa is not available everywhere. If you act like Tilpoa, can you take the risk? You cannot give hardship to disciples as Tilopa did. If you are 100% sure that you can liberate your disciple, otherwise you are then entirely a cult. So guru promotion is not proper everywhere. I don't mean disciples should not have respect to teacher. Of course one should respect the teacher but not in a fanatical way. There is no need and followers should not follow in that (fanatical) way." The later Sharmapa

"People these days use whatever little dharma they know to augment afflictive emotion, and then engender tremendous pride and conceit over it.
They teach the Dharma without taming their own minds. But as with a river rock [that sits in a river but is never soaked through], not even a hair’s tip of benefit penetrates the other people. Even worse, incorrigible people [are attracted] to this [false] dharma that increases conflict. When individuals who could be tamed by the Dharma encounter such incorrigible, their desire for the sacred Dharma is lost. It is not the fault of the Dharma; it is the fault of individuals."

Well, what's interesting about the Gelug texts I've read, and very limited teachings I've had, is that even in tantric practice, Gelug practitioners are advised to bring their "View" based on this understanding/experience of emptiness to their deity yoga, and their completion stage practices.  I've seen texts that specifically recommend analytic Madhyamaka analysis in the context of KyeRim and DzogRim.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, nevertheless, they maintain that without accessing the subtle mind through the two stages, it is extremely difficult to realize the emptiness ascertained in analysis because ordinary analytical consciousness is too coarse to realize subtle emptiness.

The American Empire is more ripe for a counter-revolution than revolution, for right-wing movements than left-wing ones. This is so primarily because of the deep xenophobic roots in the country and profound militaristic sentiments in the culture. Hence, progressive social momentums and chaotic social rebellions are more likely to reshape our priorities and gain some concessions from greedy elites and callous citizens.

All Western doctors, Buddhist or not, take this oath of harmlessness as their priority in treating patients.  I wonder how they handle gender dysphoria in chlldren?

Here is one doctor's view:

http://www.jpands.org/vol21no2/cretella.pdf

Her conclusion:
Gender dysphoria (GD) in children is a term used to describe a psychological condition in which a child experiences marked incongruence between his experienced gender and the gender associated with his biological sex. There is no rigorous scientific evidence that GD is an innate trait. Moreover, 80 percent to 95 percent of children with GD accept the reality of their biological sex and achieve emotional health by late adolescence.
The treatment of GD in childhood with hormones effectively amounts to mass experimentation on, and sterilization of, youth who are cognitively incapable of providing informed consent. There is a serious ethical problem with allowing irreversible, life-changing procedures to be performed on minors who are too young to give valid consent themselves.

Malcolm wrote:
Agreed. Minors should not be allowed to embark on hormones therapy to emulate their preferred (for the time being) gender identity. Physically altering one's body is a decision that should be left to adults.

Knowing that your business, farm, family or region is dependent on the beneficence of wealthy liberals is unlikely to be a recipe for satisfaction (see James Meek’s recent essay in the London Review of Books on Europhobic farmers who receive vast subsidies from the EU). More bizarrely, it has since emerged that regions with the closest economic ties to the EU in general (and not just of the subsidised variety) were most likely to vote Leave.
While it may be one thing for an investment banker to understand that they ‘benefit from the EU’ in regulatory terms, it is quite another to encourage poor and culturally marginalised people to feel grateful towards the elites that sustain them through handouts, month by month. Resentment develops not in spite of this generosity, but arguably because of it. This isn’t to discredit what the EU does in terms of redistribution, but pointing to handouts is a psychologically and politically naïve basis on which to justify remaining in the EU."

If Boris Johnson looked downbeat yesterday, that is because he realises that he has lost.

Perhaps many Brexiters do not realise it yet, but they have actually lost, and it is all down to one man: David Cameron.

With one fell swoop yesterday at 9:15 am, Cameron effectively annulled the referendum result, and simultaneously destroyed the political careers of Boris Johnson, Michael Gove and leading Brexiters who cost him so much anguish, not to mention his premiership.

How?

Throughout the campaign, Cameron had repeatedly said that a vote for leave would lead to triggering Article 50 straight away. Whether implicitly or explicitly, the image was clear: he would be giving that notice under Article 50 the morning after a vote to leave. Whether that was scaremongering or not is a bit moot now but, in the midst of the sentimental nautical references of his speech yesterday, he quietly abandoned that position and handed the responsibility over to his successor.

And as the day wore on, the enormity of that step started to sink in: the markets, Sterling, Scotland, the Irish border, the Gibraltar border, the frontier at Calais, the need to continue compliance with all EU regulations for a free market, re-issuing passports, Brits abroad, EU citizens in Britain, the mountain of legislation to be torn up and rewritten ... the list grew and grew.

The referendum result is not binding. It is advisory. Parliament is not bound to commit itself in that same direction.

The Conservative party election that Cameron triggered will now have one question looming over it: will you, if elected as party leader, trigger the notice under Article 50?

Who will want to have the responsibility of all those ramifications and consequences on his/her head and shoulders?

Boris Johnson knew this yesterday, when he emerged subdued from his home and was even more subdued at the press conference. He has been out-manoeuvred and check-mated.

If he runs for leadership of the party, and then fails to follow through on triggering Article 50, then he is finished. If he does not run and effectively abandons the field, then he is finished. If he runs, wins and pulls the UK out of the EU, then it will all be over - Scotland will break away, there will be upheaval in Ireland, a recession ... broken trade agreements. Then he is also finished. Boris Johnson knows all of this. When he acts like the dumb blond it is just that: an act.

The Brexit leaders now have a result that they cannot use. For them, leadership of the Tory party has become a poison chalice.

When Boris Johnson said there was no need to trigger Article 50 straight away, what he really meant to say was "never". When Michael Gove went on and on about "informal negotiations" ... why? why not the formal ones straight away? ... he also meant not triggering the formal departure. They both know what a formal demarche would mean: an irreversible step that neither of them is prepared to take.

All that remains is for someone to have the guts to stand up and say that Brexit is unachievable in reality without an enormous amount of pain and destruction, that cannot be borne. And David Cameron has put the onus of making that statement on the heads of the people who led the Brexit campaign.

#Lexit: The Left Leave Campaign

On June 23, Britain will vote in a referendum on EU membership. Voters deserve better than an ugly choice between David Cameron’s pro-EU campaign (or the pipe-dream of a “Social Europe”) on the one hand, and the reactionary anti-EU campaigning of UKIP and the Tory right on the other.

That is why we have come together to launch #Lexit: The Left Leave Campaign. We aim to build a principled, anti-racist and internationalist campaign, committed to democracy, social justice and environmental sustainability.
Why you should vote to leave on 23 June:

(1) A big business agenda
The EU is in secret negotiations with the US to launch the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). This will promote privatisation and reduce corporate standards to the lowest level either side of the Atlantic. War on Want estimates the deal could cost 600,000 jobs.
Membership of the EU hampers any attempt to nationalise the railways or to rescue industries such as steel where jobs are threatened.
Countries such as Greece, Cyprus, Ireland and Portugal have suffered brutal EU austerity programmes. In Greece, health spending fell by a quarter, education by a third.

(2) Unreformable and undemocratic
Decision-making in the EU is dominated by unelected bodies such as the European Commission and European Central Bank. Those running them are contemptuous of democracy. Confronted with discontent over TTIP, Cecilia Malmström, European trade commissioner, replied: “I do not take my mandate from the European people.”
Rewriting or scrapping the basic EU treaties would need unanimous agreement between all 28 governments.

(3) Rights and justice
It is a myth that the EU defends workers. Equal pay legislation came out of the struggle of the women sewing machinists at Ford Dagenham in 1968, not from the EU. Most health and safety legislation originates in the 1970s, a time of union strength. The national minimum wage was won by the labour movement—not given to us by the EU. The EU has not defended workers against any of the 12 Tory anti-union laws since 1980.
The left defends the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) adopted by the Council of Europe, a completely separate body from the EU that Britain would remain a member of whatever the referendum result.

(4) Fortress Europe
The so-called freedom of movement of labour does not apply to non-EU citizens. For those from within the EU, four European Court of Justice rulings have outlawed trade union and government action to enforce equal rights for imported (“posted”) workers.
Now the EU is engaged in the mass deportation of refugees from Greece. Amnesty International says of the deportation programme, “The very principle of international protection for those fleeing war and persecution is at stake.” We defend the rights of refugees.
“Fortress Europe” is also developing a military dimension, which EU treaties openly link to Nato.

(5) Heading right?
If Britain votes to leave, it won’t automatically mean a move to the right. The Tories are being torn apart by debate over the EU. If Cameron loses, he will almost certainly go. If a Conservative government survives, it will be hopelessly fragile.
Not only will the government be weakened. The rich and powerful overwhelmingly support British membership. The City, the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors all support the status quo. So do at least two-thirds of large British firms surveyed by the Financial Times last year. A crisis for our rulers can open up a greater space for the left.

In any event, people who are freaked out by Brexit in the UK have themselves to blame. This whole thing was staged by Cameron and it blew up in his face. He tried to use the Brexit vote very much the same way he manipulated the Scottish Independence referendum.

I imagine though, that there is serious backpedaling going on, but all this shows is just how tenuous the EU's hold is. The EU's approach has not been, "UK we'll miss you," but rather, "You fools, you will regret this." Not a very appealing message.

In Vajrayana Buddhism, the ādibuddha (Tibetan: dang-po'i sangs-rgyas), is the "First Buddha." The term reemerges in tantric literature, most prominently in the Kalachakra.[1] According to the first interpretation, ādi means “first” such that the ādibuddha was the first to attain Buddhahood.[2] According to the second interpretation, ādi means “primordial,” not referring to a person but to an innate wisdom that is present in all sentient beings.[3] In Tibetan Buddhism, the term ādibuddha is often used to describe Samantabhadra or Vajradhara.[4] In East Asia, the ādibuddha is typically considered to be Vairocana.[5]

There are also big areas of disadvantage in the USA, with the middle-class incomes stagnating and the drying up of opportunities.

But the question is, will leaving the European Union actually make any difference to those circumstances for the working poor of England?

In all of the rhetoric from the Leave campaigners, I can't recall anything concrete about the economic benefits of separation from the EU. It is all angry talk about 'taking our country back' and 'stopping foreigners from taking our jobs'.

I think there are some powerful forces around who have worked out how to capture that anger and direct it for their own purposes. One of the main backers of the Leave campaign was profiled in the Australian papers yesterday, he is a billionaire businessman. Chump said leaving the EU was 'fantastic', and I have a strong urge to be suspicious of anything that Chump thinks is 'fantastic'. Most of what Chump thinks is 'fantastic' is really tied to what he thinks he can make money out of. After all, for Chump, the only really fantastic thing is money.

So I'm much more suspicious of these string-pulling back-room business types than the so-called 'EU Beaureacrats'. In Western society, business outguns beauracracy all the time. A lot of the talk about 'the evils of government' from right-wingers, is so that they can dismantle the regulations that stop them from concentrating yet more wealth in their hands.

And I think all this talk about 'the people taking their country back' is very sad. The fish and chip shop owners and unemployed parents won't be any better of as a result, after the euphoria of 'independence day' has passed, and the placards are all put away, I can't see how there will be any economic benefits for them. It's all pseudo-patriotic sloganeering, as far as I can see.

Temicco said:
I'm not entirely sure. In the Milindapanha for example, it is said that the characteristic mark of wisdom (which I assume to be panna) is "illuminating". Immediately thereafter it says that when wisdom arises in the mind, it either makes the radiance of knowledge shine forth, or it caues the light of knowledge to arise (the two translations I have differ as to which of these is done by knowledge and which by vision). The Dvedhavitakka compares each of the tevijja to light, but whether this can be generalized to vidya as a whole is uncertain. Page 121 of Nanamoli's Patisambhidamagga, in which knowledge is discussed, compares knowledge (of the 4NT) to light.

It is a translation issue-- Tibetan is a synonym poor language, compared to Sanskrit. But there is no cross over between luminosity as ultimate purity of phenomena and usages of the term where it actually means light.

The Chinese, in the context noted above, translate ābhāsvara/prabhāsvara as purity. Clarity refers to the open space of the mind, which receives impressions.

Are we going to re-establish border controls in Northern Ireland now? Basically, the border security, which has been raised as an anti-EU argument, are governed by the Schengen-Treaty. Britain never ratified it. Still going to tolerate it? That would be against the spirit of separatism ...

And what about U.K. citizens who founded families and living in Europe because of labour mobility within the EU? (Northern Ireland probably again is the biggest issue). Are they being sent back "home"?
And what about EU citizens who founded families in Britain, because of the same? Are they being sent back "home"?

Before all, it appears a victory for sophist demagogues, creating an illusiory justification for Segregation.

I find it somewhat amazing that people who are nominally left in Europe so enthusiastically favor policies which originate from the Chicago School of Economics and the American Right:
Neo-liberalism would accept the nineteenth century liberal emphasis on the fundamental importance of the individual, but it would substitute for the nineteenth century goal of laissez- faire as a means to this end, the goal of the competitive order. It would seek to use competition among producers to protect consumers from exploitation, competition among employers to protect workers and owners of property, and competition among consumers to protect the enterprises themselves. The state would police the system, establish conditions favorable to competition and prevent monopoly, provide a stable monetary framework, and relieve acute misery and distress. The citizens would be protected against the state by the existence of a free private market; and against one another by the preservation of competition.
And:
It is essential, however, that the performance of this function involve the minimum of interference with the market. There is justification for subsidizing people because they are poor, whether they are farmers or city-dwellers, young or old. There is no justification for subsidizing farmers as farmers rather than because they are poor. There is justification in trying to achieve a minimum income for all; there is no justification for setting a minimum wage and thereby increasing the number of people without income; there is no justification for trying to achieve a minimum consumption of bread separately, meat separately, and so on.

Further, there is an account of the liberation of Samantabhadra and the delusion of sentient beings. This is not inconsistent with ChNN's observation you bring up.

Thus the argument that one needs a gun for protection is downright ludicrous. In fact, the number one categories of victims of gun homicides are African Americans at 55%.

"...gun suicides now account for six-in-ten firearms deaths, the highest share since at least 1981."

"Compared with other developed nations, the U.S. has a higher homicide rate and higher rates of gun ownership, but not higher rates for all other crimes."

"The Small Arms Survey in 2007 found not only that U.S. civilians had more total firearms than any other nation (270 million) but also that the rate of ownership (about 90 firearms for every 100 people) was higher than in other countries. “With less than 5 percent of the world’s population, the United States is home to 35-50 per cent of the world’s civilian-owned guns,” according to the survey, which included estimates for 178 countries." (seems a bit obsessive, no?)

"As for gun crime, research has found that the U.S. has a higher gun homicide and overall homicide rate than most developed nations, although the U.S. does not have the world’s highest rate for either. The U.S. does not outrank other developed nations for overall crime, but crimes with firearms are more likely to occur in the U.S."

"According to U.N. statistics, the U.S. firearm homicide rate and overall homicide rate are higher than those in Canada and in Western European and Scandinavian nations, but lower than those in many Caribbean and Latin American countries for which data are available."

"However, the report placed the U.S. among the top countries for attacks involving firearms. “Mexico, the USA and Northern Ireland stand out with the highest percentages gun-related attacks (16%, 6% and 6% respectively).” The U.S. had the highest share of sexual assault involving guns."

point of historical order:

when the Romans finally vacated the British Isles, they left a power vacuum.  The Celts had grown accustomed to Roman power keeping order.  Who filled that vacuum?  Angles and Saxons from what is now Flanders and/or the Netherlands--people who speak what we now know of as Old English, which is a very different tongue indeed from anything Celtic.  The Celts were pushed northward and westward into Cornwall, Wales, and Scotland, where Celtic languages such as Welsh and Scots Gaelic are still spoken.  (and until the middle of the last century, the Isle of Man too.)

my point is that English-ness is derived from those Angles, and not from the Celts displaced by their ancestors.

Kaccāni said:
Only media power and manipulation are driving people into it. You must understand, that it was more or less a miracle that Merkel rose to power. At the time, Germany had a larger Democrat base than there were Conservatives (which, as an adept of former Chancellor Kohl), she comes from. There were two driving forces that led to her rise. One, the social democats were split by Oscar Lafontaine (with a little help of former East German politician Gregor Gysi). They formed the "socialist left". This, in fact, rendered a democrat majority both as losers to the Conservative fraction in the election. To this date I wonder what they were paid for doing that. Two, the former liberal party, as a junior partner of the conservatives, considerably turned libertarian in the post-Schröderian heir that Merkel inherited and dwells her reign upon. Unfortunately, their key figure, who could stand for liberal values, Guido Westerwelle, died from Leukemia (after failing to lead the party out of that coalition mess).

Merkel herself is good at maintaining power. She knows how to immobilize political opponents, her main skill. Believe me, the majority of Germans (except maybe Bavaria) are not fond of her reign. Her party has lost considerable voters, to the point that there is a right shift to deal with the new right, trying to regain their base. It's that right shift that is the problem here. Liberal attempts at solving that problem have been too easily dealt with. It's exactly this new right that burns down refugee camps here, that is following the Trumpian example of racial and national separationism. Germany, too, is a melting pod.

On top of that, consider that the main source of the new far right originates in the German east (those who were told in this thread to have been screwed over). One problem is, that some rural societies did not have  the 50 years of integration attemts with foreign (Turkish, Croatian, Serbian and Italian) workers that the western parts of Germany had. They were freed from a tyrant at exactly the point where capitalist oligarchies went nuts due to the acceleration of markets by automated trading and globalization. That's bad, but it happened. It's susceptible to prejudice. It has turned formerly socialist-oppressed people into capitalism-oppressed racist-nationalists. Now pouring more prejudice there won't help one single bit, but confirm the (we had it in another thread) silly people who get off on "me first!".

Malcolm wrote:
If you think the solution to prejudice is enforcing the technocratic rule of Brussels, you are kidding yourself. The EU survives solely because it is in Germany's present interest that it survive. When that changes, and it will, the EU will collapse like the house of cards that it is.

Kaccāni said:
Uniting all the integration-opponents throughout Europe by example (who thrive on violence against any minority, or say, "foreigners"), is not the way to go. Heck, Suisse claimed that they have more "foreigners" than any E.U. country, and a German nationalist politician publicly asked whether they count Germans as "foreigners". That's the level of public demagogy there. Those movements exist throughout Europe. Austrian government recently almost turned nationalist-conservative. Let's not talk about Hungary, the chief source of neo-nazism. Or Polish government, who are eager to follow their example. Or those non-central countries like Spain or Greece whose economy suffered a ton. And in the middle of all of that, due to the mess global oil-wars have created in the middle east and the refugee crisis that followed it, Turkish quasi-dicator Erdogan can spill his religio-conservative spit over the whole debate.

If you really want a European Union, you need to more than just a currency union. You will need an actual democratic government, not a system of trade agreements and enforcers of the same.

Each of the nations which form the EU will need to relinquish its own sovereignty.

Since no European nation is willing to do so, least of all the French, your EU was doomed before it began (and of course, it is not an accident that the former Holy Roman Empire regions get along swimmingly, for the most part). You will also need to decide on one official language in which to conduct all business and which will form the primary language of education.

What you are talking about is not an EU, but a United States of Europe, a USE. But you are very far away from a USE because of the individual desire of each of your member nations to preserve its own unique identity. Thus, there is no chance that Europe will ever be able form into a coherent state.

This is why I think that exit is the best way forward for Britain. It may not happen in this referendum, but it will happen eventually, within the next ten years, I guess.

Ho Chi Minh etc.] do not inspire the same visceral reaction as do the crimes of
Hitler.” A large part of the reason for these discrepant attitudes was that “to
condemn the Soviet Union too thoroughly would be to condemn a part of
what some of the Western left once held dear as well.” Or as Tony Judt put it:
“To many Western European intellectuals communism was a failed variant of
a common progressive heritage.”

Well, no, the purges of Stalin, the cultural revolution of Mao, the killing fields of Cambodia, were all essentially born out of an impulse to cultural suicide which was the legacy of centuries of enduring despotic rulers — communism was the excuse, not the cause.

The war in Vietnam was a proxy war, as was the Cuban crisis, and we should have handled things there very differently.

The reason many find the Nazi regime more horrifying is because it was so clearly based on the irrationality of hatred for others.

But in fact, the structure of totalitarian states, whether right or left, are identical. They all rely on a tripod of the military, a civil police force, and a powerful extra-judicial secret police (KGB, Stazi, Gestapo, etc.) who keep watch on the other two.

Malcolm, it would be greatly appreciated if you have Dharma citations that answer the two points I made about the Buddha and the ship captain and the 10th vow. If my understanding of these things is incorrect, according to the Teachings, I have no problem being corrected...

Malcolm wrote:
In order for a being to qualify for "liberation" according to the 10th vows you mention, they must fulfill all the following ten criteria: they must be harmful to the teachings; despise the Jewels; rob the property of the Sangha; despise Mahāyāna; physically harm the guru; wound vajra brothers and sisters; create obstacles to accomplishment; utterly lack love and compassion; lack samaya vows; and possess an incorrect view of cause and result.

As far as the famed ship's captain story, in order to act in the manner of the ship's captain, one must possess the same level of clairvoyance as the ship's captain in order to know whether the mind of a being is truly harmful or not. One must also possess realization of emptiness so that one's compassion is free from any sort of personal self-interest and coloring.

We are heading into the age of weapons. But it can be prevented if human beings set down their arms and embrace each other.

Malcolm,
in an ideal world I wholeheartedly agree with you...but this is samsara, and I for one have no problem taking on the bad karma of taking somebody out that is going to harm either my Teacher, one of my Vajra siblings, or an innocent person. Life is short and there are evil people who would take your precious human rebirth from you thereby delaying your Awakening for who knows how long. I am reminded of the story of the Buddha and the ship captain as well as the 10th root commitment of a ngakpa:
"10.   To have compassion for evil beings especially those who harm the doctrine
This refers to failing to act in a potentially disastrous situation and spilling the heart blood of self-justification whenever it violates one vows.  It is a failure of one who holds the bodhisattva vow not to kill, if it saves other beings from harm. A bodhisattva must act towards the liberation of violently malicious beings even if this entails destroying their physical form. This vow must be considered in the context of the fourth vow not to foresake loving kindness on behalf of sentient beings – even those with negative motivation and harmful intentions.   Shakyamuni Buddha told a sea captain that an act of murder he committed was not negative as, having overheard the victim plotting to kill all the others on the boat the captain’s  motivation was compassionate in wishing to save the lives of his five hundred other voyagers. Pacifism should not detract from one’s kindness. If the avoidance of killing is merely cowardice and lack of deep concern for others, then failure to act is a breakage of one’s vows."

Friend Nick (we have after all been conversing for years), let me put it to you plainly.

The greatest threat to humanity today is nuclear conflict. We live in a world where no form of government nor regime can keep us safe from the threat of a nuclear holocaust. And in fact, all indications are that we are falling headlong in that kind of conflict, with very few barriers —whether social, political, economic, or military — which seem to be able to withstand it. Thus far, it is only by the amazing self-discipline on the part of all our respective militaries regardless of political system or ideology that we have not actually blown ourselves into oblivion already. We should in fact be amazed we still exist given how easily we can destroy ourselves if just a few conditions are not met or backfire.

So the real question is: how do we prevent humanity's utter self-destruction? This is really the only salient question we should have in our minds in any discussion of post Hiroshima world politics.

In reality, the only acceptable alternative—since all others merely lead to the endless conflict of war and its miseries —is the complete and utter disarmament of humanity. This is the only sane path forward.

Marx himself termed Capitalism "progressive," a necessary phase in human history. Marx's specific theory was that the Socialist phase in human history could only happen after the world economy had been completely industrialized under advanced Capitalism. Lenin decided this was not necessary, that one only needed proletariat elites, and that this was sufficient for revolution.

Frankly, Marx really had no idea what advanced Capitalism looked like. He further thought, inaccurately, that the revolution was going to happen in the US and Western Europe. Boy, was he ever mistaken about that.

The brutalism you are referring to was a direct result of Lenin's jumping the gun and revising Marx's theory.

Today, there are no more "Reds", other than in name only. Fascist Corporatism is winning largely because of neoliberalism. Nationalized socialisms such as Stalinism, Maoism, etc., were never going to win against international capital.

As a moral and aesthetic cosmolgy, not literally. For example, Edward Henning, probably the worlds leading expert on Kalacakra calculations right now, points out in his lengthy technical book, Kalacakra and the Tibetan Calendar, that the authors of the Kalacakra certainly did not take the Meru cosmology literally because the calculations it offers for calendar making won't work in a Meru Cosmology, though they do work fine in a terra-centric model, just like Ptolmeic astrology (upon which all Indian astrological systems are based).

Pretty much, it is true. The language Indians use to describe these things are largely lifted from Greek. I am not suggesting that Indians did not have their own astrological and astronomical ideas prior to the Greeks, for they certainly did, but in terms of calendar making and so on...


Indrajala said:
The original Kalacakra authors studied a number of astronomical systems available to them, one of which was most certainly based on a Hellenistic model since it uses a tropical zodiac (in contrast to a sidereal zodiac which was the norm in India -- the Kalacakra sages were quite innovative by the standards of their day).  The Kalacakra also describes the corruption of siddhānta -s (astronomical treatises), which the commentary identifies as those of Brahma, Sauram, Yamanakam and Romakam. They took into consideration a number of models with clear foreign sources, so they had to somehow fit the mathematical astronomy they understood (much of Hellenistic in origin) with Meru cosmology.


Malcolm wrote:
But they didn't really fit it in. You should check out Henning's book, if you have it.


Indrajala said:
However, in earlier periods Buddhists unquestioningly believed in flat earth cosmology. The * Lokasthānābhidharma-śāstra 佛說立世阿毘曇論, for instance, details a flat earth cosmology of Mt. Meru and the four continents, explaining in literal physical terms how these two bodies (which are described as flat drum-shaped deva palaces) orbit above the disc-shaped world at an altitude half that of Mt. Meru, driven by a circuit of wind (vāyu-maṇḍalaka). Solar luminosity is said to be a result of karma of beings. In such a world, the flat earth is stationary while the sun, moon and stars revolve above, not actually dipping below the edge of the world. The apparent arc that the sun follows as it rises and sets as seen from earth is the sun following along its circular path above at an unchanging altitude.

Among many other things, the function of a sadhana is to work with the experiential wisdom, after it has been stabilized by working with the experiential view. This is how the student "brings back" that recognition, in terms of sadhana practice.

Trangu Rinpoche's statement is consistent with the Sūtra yāna approach upheld in Kagyu and Gelug, but it is not the approach in Sakya and Nyingma.
It means that one has received direct introduction through the word empowerment and is experientially familiar with the example wisdom. So no, one has not realized emptiness, but neither is one pretending.

Dzogchen, of course, is quite different.

Astus said:
Example wisdom occurs at the wisdom empowerment, but according to Tsele Natsok (Empowerment, p 41) if it's not genuine insight "there is no way to recognize all forms of conceptual thinking to be the innate nature (dharmata), and thus one misses the point of the third empowerment. Without experiencing the nature of the third empowerment, one does not obtain the true fourth empowerment."

Also, according to Thrangu rinpoche (Creation and Completion, p 142-143), the sudden pointing out of the nature of the mind "as authentic as it is, is in some ways adulterated by conceptualization and therefore remains an experience rather than a realization. The problem with this is that, while the recognition is authentic as far as it goes, because it is incomplete and imperfect, it will at some point vanish. When it vanishes, the student does not know how to bring it back, because their initial recognition was experienced under the dramatic circumstances of receiving the pointing out from their guru." That is practically a criticism of the example wisdom. Therefore, he says, the solution to that in the Kagyu tradition is "to enable students, through their own exploration, to come to a decisive recognition of the mind's nature."

In 2001, 2016 the govt required this massive slum to be made smaller - both times leaving the core intact and demolishing hovels. Hardly "constant attack". As I say, if it were happening in the UK we'd have clear this slum by now. And arrested those who resisted. There is precedent.

If the people who run the place were more obviously looking after the people; allowing them a vote, providing equal rights for women; and providing sanitation, running water, and all the things we expect in a civilised country (if it wasn't a medieval slum in order words) then I'd be a lot more sympathetic. As it is, they do seem to need an intervention of some kind. And reducing their numbers to just 5000 seems quite restrained.

The bullet from an AR-15 does an entirely different kind of violence to the human body. It’s relatively small, but it leaves the muzzle at three times the speed of a handgun bullet. It has so much energy that it can disintegrate three inches of leg bone. “It would just turn it to dust,” says Donald Jenkins, a trauma surgeon at University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio. If it hits the liver, “the liver looks like a jello mold that’s been dropped on the floor.” And the exit wound can be a nasty, jagged hole the size of an orange.

These high-velocity bullets can damage flesh inches away from their path, either because they fragment or because they cause something called cavitation. When you trail your fingers through water, the water ripples and curls. When a high-velocity bullet pierces the body, human tissues ripples as well—but much more violently. The bullet from an AR-15 might miss the femoral artery in the leg, but cavitation may burst the artery anyway, causing death by blood loss. A swath of stretched and torn tissue around the wound may die. That’s why, says Rhee, a handgun wound might require only one surgery but an AR-15 bullet wound might require three to ten.

Then, multiply the damage from a single bullet by the ease of shooting an AR-15, which doesn’t kick. “The gun barely moves. You can sit there boom boom boom and reel off shots as fast as you can move your finger,” says Ernest Moore, a trauma surgeon at Denver Health and editor of the Journal of Trauma and Acute Surgery, which just published an issue dedicated to gun violence.

Malcolm wrote:
SCOTUS rulings can be overturned. But here are the precedents:

tomamundsen said:
Long a controversial issue in American political, legal, and social discourse, the Second Amendment has been at the heart of several Supreme Court decisions.

In United States v. Cruikshank (1875), the Court ruled that "[t]he right to bear arms is not granted by the Constitution; neither is it in any manner dependent upon that instrument for its existence. The Second Amendment means no more than that it shall not be infringed by Congress, and has no other effect than to restrict the powers of the National Government."[85]

In United States v. Miller (1939), the Court ruled that the amendment "[protects arms that had a] reasonable relationship to the preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia".[86]

In District of Columbia v. Heller (2008), the Court ruled that the Second Amendment "codified a pre-existing right" and that it "protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home" but also stated that "the right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose".[87]

In McDonald v. Chicago (2010),[88] the Court ruled that the Second Amendment limits state and local governments to the same extent that it limits the federal government.[89]

Malcolm wrote:

The ruling you cite refers to tasers, and not assault rifles. As SCOTUS notes above in the Heller decision:
"the right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose".
It is my point of view that it is not constitutionally problematical at all to limit assault rifles for civilian use under this principle. Use of sporting weapons such as bolt-action or single-action rifles or breech-loaded shotguns for hunting and so on, I have no issue with. Possession of semiautomatic handguns such as Glocks, etc., should be reserved for police and military use, along with semi-automatic rifles and shotguns. You will note that in none of the decisions SCOTUS made is there any mention of the Second Amendment being validly used to defend oneself against the State. You do not have that right, and you never have.

The present gun policies of the US do not support a well-regulated Militia. They in fact do the opposite. What this statement in fact says is that the government should not infringe orderly, well-regulate Militias. Why? To defend the State. There is no language in this amendment that suggests the second amendment supports the idea of protecting oneself against the Gvt. It suggests the opposite in fact, that citizens use their arms to suppress threats to the State.

Just in case anyone really doubts the AR-15 is a military grade weapon:


Unknown said:
The AR-15 is a military and civilian rifle that has been produced in many different versions. The term AR-15 was chosen by Colt for the civilian models it produced after selling the rifle to the U.S. military as the M16 rifle, and many people and references use the term AR-15 exclusively for civilian models. This article discusses the original design for military users and its major variants, however they are labeled. AR-15 rifles are lightweight, gas-operated, magazine-fed, and air-cooled. They fire an intermediate cartridge, and are manufactured with extensive use of aluminum alloys and synthetic materials.

The AR-15 was first built in 1959 by ArmaLite as a small arms rifle for the United States armed forces. Because of financial problems, ArmaLite sold the design to Colt. After some modifications, the redesigned rifle was adopted as the M16 rifle. In 1963, Colt started selling the semi-automatic version of the rifle for civilians designated as the Colt SP1. Although the name AR-15 remains a Colt registered trademark, variants of the firearm are made, modified, and sold under various names by multiple manufacturers.

OK, thanks. While we're on the topic can you say something about why DJKR would say... when Vairotsana translated the word shunyata, he considered it from many angles and came up with tong pa–nyi, which expresses a lot of potential, the complete opposite of the word “empty".
as quoted above? How is it that 'stong pa nyid' expresses a lot of potential, if you agree with this statement?

Malcolm wrote:
Well, the word stong pa has several meanings in Tibetan. It's primary meaning is isolation ( dben pa ) or exhaustion ( zad par 'gyur ba ). It also can bear the meaning of ripen ( smin pa ) and benefit ( phan pa ); it's a kind of pulse, it is a phase of the moon; it also refers to a void space, for example, the emptiness of a pot that has nothing in it.

I would be very surprised if in fact Vairocana was the one who came up with the term stong pa nyid for śūnyatā. It is not impossible, but what is the real evidence for it?

Malcolm wrote:
Generally, in Dzogchen texts in man ngag sde, where it occasionally occurs, it should probably be rendered as something like "fundamentally/originally/primordially limitless" with a note that it is a gloss on the term śūnyatā.


Orna Almogi comments in Rong-zom-pa's Discourses on Buddhology, pg. 162, footnote 64:
Compare the term ye 'byams, which is an old designation for emptiness (Śūnyatā: stong pa nyid)
and is still used in the rNying-ma tradition in this sense. Although the term is often translated as
'primordial field,' such an understanding does not seem to be lexically attested, It is conceivable
that here, too, the component ye was initially employed in the sense of 'totality.' In this case, the
term ye 'byams would literally mean 'total/complete openness/expanse,' that is, 'emptiness.' As in
the case of the term ye shes, however, I have not been able to locate any Tibetan source to support
such an etymology, Note also the meaning of the Zhang-zhung word ye sangs, which according to
Martin 2004, S.v., is equivalent, among other things, to Tibetan stong, that is, 'empty,' 'void.'

dzogchungpa said:
Also, could you say more about the rationale for the original translation and subsequent revision?

Malcolm wrote:
Lost to history, perhaps it was overtly influenced by early translations of sūtras from Chinese into Tibetan. As it stands now the term is quite rare, though it makes an appearance in some sems sde texts and in the Treasury of the Dharmadhātu and Resting into the Nature of the Mind by Longchenpa.

How does everyone feel about this idea of "two quite distinct ways of translation"?

Curious to hear what others think.

Malcolm wrote:
I can't speak to what other translators do or don't do. And of course more than one scholar has taken issue with Dowman's translations, the same applies to Tony Duff, etc. But that is not very important. Why? We would be very foolish to think that after translating Dharma texts into English for a generation that we are in any position to stake out definite positions about how things could or should be translated into English.

For example, someone brought up the example of " stong pa nyid " as a translation for śūnyatā. Śūnyatā was originally translated into Tibetan as " ye 'byams." Very few people are aware of this, and so we run into rather strange translations of the term, not realizing it translated śūnyatā. So what to do?

Or do we use the very loose approximation "timeless infinity," as one translator suggests? Or do we translate it as emptiness, as we generally translate stong pa nyid?

Someone else mentioned committee translations. In my opinion, the quality of a translations depends on the committee, who did the original, who edited it, and so on. The failure of translation committees is the desire to create a brand, like different models of cars. Different translations from the same committee exhibit different levels of accuracy and quality depending on the composition of the actual team. Even among Tibetans, those who are educated in Shedras may not actually have the knowledge of Dzogchen for example, to accurately give information when questioned about the usage of term such as la zla ba.

The quality of a translation also depends very much on the ability of a person to express themselves well in their native tongue. Poor writers make poor translations. There are other factors: are you a native English speaker? Even the best of the non-native translators, not just Guenther, quite often make choices which are quite frankly nonidiomatic English and are strange in our language. Do you speak British, American, Canadian, Australian or Indian English? One's choice of words, one's compositional style, and so on, will all very much be influenced by the country and education one has.

Than there are other factors: people who have never translated anything other than Dharma texts tend to have a very brittle and dry style, because Dharma texts from the traditions of Madhyamaka and so on are exactly that, dry and brittle taxonomies which give very little indication of or possibility for process.

For myself personally, studying Tibetan Medicine opened up a whole new way of looking at Tibetan to which I previously had been blind. Biographies too demand a somewhat more personable style. In general, one modern fault of we Tibetan translators is a lack of diversity in our reading. I know of professors, much hailed for their translation of philosophical texts, who cannot handle that most simplistic of formats, the sadhana, with any skill at all. I have watched famous translators badly botch explanations given by Lamas because the translator had no knowledge of Tibetan Medicine and was therefore unable to accurately translate some concepts from a Dzogchen text, and amazingly just make up some bullshit on the spot, apparently to cover up their own ignorance. That said, I also have sympathy for oral translators, it is no easy job. Oral translators usually are not such good text translators, and the reverse is also true. There are very few translators who excel at both. As an oral translator, for example, I suck.

Then there is the issue of "helping" the text. It is the habit of some translators to embed their understanding in their translations by fleshing them out, sometimes by as much as 40 percent, with extraneous material either derived from commentaries or from information provided in the course of hearing a text being taught. Other translations are leaner, more austere, tending to stick more closely to the text, depending on the reader's familiarity with the subject. Is this good, bad? How can we say it is either, when Tibetan translators themselves have often embellished?

If anything, translators of texts should find themselves humbled by the process. There is little glory in it. The translation process is driven by a passion for discovering the unknown, the unread. Principally, Dharma translation should be driven by the motivation to deepen one's own practice, and to aid others. It can be especially disheartening in the beginning because you are mostly wrong all the time; but of course in the end, when one can share texts that have never been seen in English, it is deeply rewarding because of the joy it brings to oneself through deeper understanding and the joy it brings to others because it is like giving the blind eyes to see, however imperfect those eyes may be and still in need of correction.

While I certainly admit to having my preferences in both translation terms as well as translators, in general we should try to be supportive of the efforts of translators and not give them too hard a time. This does not mean that people cannot discuss this or that term and its suitability. Most people do not realize that a majority of texts translated from Sanskrit to Tibetan, especially the more important texts, underwent multiple revisions, a process that began in the mid-8th century and ended only in the 14th century. There exist dictionaries of archaic terms and their modern (i.e. post-Ralpacan) equivalents. Translators themselves should do their own research and not depend so heavily on translations made two, three, four, and five decades ago. Translators must question why for example we are translating ye shes as "primordial wisdom," rig pa as awareness, etc. We must not fall into formulaic translations, because in the end we will wind up with the very clumsy, basically unreadable translations done by Tibetans after the 14th century.

I would only caution those translators who are much given to criticizing the work of others that such criticism merely opens the door for rebuttal and criticism in turn, and this helps no one in the end. People may wish to ignore this fact, but translation is a crowd-sourced process. The more eyes there are on our translations, the more accurate they can in time become.

I am sharing these thoughts with you because the question arose and because I have spent the last 24 years of my life obeying my guru, Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje's command that I become a translator. In that time I have translated many texts, made even more mistakes, and have had my own pride and arrogance knocked down again and again (as hard as it may seem for some of you to believe) by the process of translation.

I will share with you one of my guiding principles in translating Dzogchen texts into English, since that is really what this thread is about. Rongzom states that while the words of the Great Perfection are simple, their meaning is vast and deep like space. On the other hand, the words of the lower vehicles are are very precise and detailed in their complexity, but their meaning is rough, just like a pile of dust. Therefore, as much as possible, when translating the texts of the Great Perfection, I try to keep my English as simple and plain as I can.

However there are some other principles that I also observe summarized here: http://www3.dbu.edu/mitchell/poundtra.htm, and based on the work of Ezra Pound.

1) A true translation must reject "Wardour-Street English," the pseudo-archaic language of Victorian translators associated with William Morris and F. W. Newman.  Pound was willing to experiment with a variety of poetic style and diction.  He made free-verse translations of classical works acceptable.

2) Each translation is a kind of criticism of the original.  It stresses the strengths of the original, but it also shows what its limits may have been.

3) No translation has to reproduce all aspects of the original.  It can choose to concentrate on only some aspects.  It can leave part of the original out.  It may even add to it or rearrange it in order to accomplish the translator's purpose.

4) Modern topical allusions may be used to bring across the emotions associated with the original's allusions.

5) Translations should be new poems in their own right.  They should be artistically well-done. (while this refers to poems, it applies to everything)

6) History is a product of the present.  All knowledge of the past is experienced in our current reception and reading of it.  In this sense, all translation is both a continuity and a re-reading of past texts and authors.

One may find much food for thought on this Wiki page too:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation

Finally, another point that many people don't understand. Poetry and Prosody (Kavya) are distinct from the style of Karika literature of Indo-Tibetan religio-philosophical texts. Texts from the Samcayagathas to the Precious Treasury of the Dharmadhātu are not poetry, nor are they intended as poetry. The so called "verse" portions of the tantras emulate the gathas of sūtra, and so too are not poetry, but are in metered verses to aid memorization. While such compositions can be "poetic," it must be firmly understood they are not poems in our sense of the word. True poetry in the Indo-Tibetan traditions is a very specific, very highly stylized form which is generally confined to the so called "verses of praise" and the dedications found in the beginning and end of texts, ranging from short texts to multivolume treatises, and whose complexity and depth depends very much on the education of the author. Real poetry in Tibetan can be pretty boring reading, depending on deep familiarity with the synonyms which may be found in the compendium Amarakośa and its commentary. For example, a common synonym for the sun is "The one who is drawn by seven horses."

So, in the end, it is better to be light-handed in our criticisms of translators and their translations unless they are engaged in gross fabrications or outright plagiarism.

In fact, believing you are too good to waste time on gradual teachings probably means the best practice for you is 100000 prostrations to knock these spiritual materialistic ideas out of your head. But I may be wrong. That's why you need a teacher who can get to know you and have the wisdom to advice appropriately.

I realize this might be in context of developing meditative concentration, but the way it's written makes it sound like this is advice for any scenario.

Take only what will serve the practice of the Dharma.
Treat everyone like new acquaintances

The point is that what you are describing is an intellectual view that is meaningless outside of the context of a teacher student relationship, where such a view is integrated meaningfully with practice. There is no liberation through words, my friend, as your final citation points out.

It is funny to watch ordinary people like us confidentally opine on awakening, it is like watching children playing at being royalty.
This is all very nice, Astus, but what you are describing is just an intellectual view thst wont help one deal with affluctions at all.

Astus said:
What view is not intellectual? The teachings are all made of words. How one uses them decides if they are of any help. Even Bodhidharma taught the direct entrance as "to awaken to the Truth through the doctrine". And direct entrance is where the teaching of afflictions are bodhi belongs to:

"In the Ultimate Vehicle, we neither transform our afflictions nor extinguish them; our mind is originally pure and lucid. This mind is inherent in everyone; we do not need to seek it externally. This is the Chan School’s principle of “affliction is bodhi; birth and death (samsara) is nirvana.”"
( From Bodhi Mind to Ultimate Enlightenment )

As for teaching it, here's a short story.

For a long time Yaoshan did not enter the hall to speak. 
The temple director said to him, “The monks have been waiting for a long time for the master to give them some instruction.”
Yaoshan said, “Ring the bell!”
The monks assembled in the hall. 
Yaoshan then got down from the Dharma seat and went back to the abbot’s quarters.
The temple director followed him and said, “Master, since you consented to speak to the monks, why didn’t you say anything?”
Yaoshan said, “Sutras have sutra teachers. Shastras have shastra teachers. Why are you unhappy with me?”
(Zen's Chinese Heritage, p 124-125)

So, what is there to do with views and words?

"The more words and thoughts the more you will go astray.
Stop speaking, stop thinking and there is nothing you cannot understand."

It basically just feels that the only way you can get to non-gradual teachings to see if they even work for you is through a long process of, more or less, jumping through gradual, path-based hoops. This process will either a) be kind of a waste of time and potentially delusive, or b) really helpful. And if TB considers most people to be lamrimpas, then I get why administering such a path for the 95% of people who will benefit from it is the best idea. It's just frustrating that the more direct teachings are kind of locked away at the top of the vehicles, as opposed to being more immediately accessible.

tomamundsen said:
I think there is a difference between how things are presented to the public and then how things actually work out once you build a relationship with a teacher. If you have the capacity for the "higher" practices, I don't think the teacher will be reluctant to give them to you. Things are presented more formally to public audiences, but working with a teacher eventually becomes a really personal thing and you will get whichever practices are best suited for you. I guess I shouldn't speak generally, I doubt everyone's experience is that way. But I do think that if you create a genuine connection with a teacher, you won't be disappointed and feel like things are being held back from you. It could be the case that you are instructed to engage in more gradual teachings, but if you trust in your teacher fully, there won't be an issue.

Temicco said:
That's a good point. But then, part of my concern is related to the (apparent) fixedness of the lamrimpa/cigcarba categories in Tibetan thinking -- Chan doesn't make such a big deal out of karmically determined capacity, and mainly discusses it as a point of sectarianism (in that Chan doesn't cater to people of lower capacities). In Chan you never hear, "won't realize it because of your karma", you hear, "you won't realize it because you persist in these bad habits, even though you don't have to". A subtle difference, but a big one. Would getting pinned as someone of lower capacity by one Tibetan teacher follow me throughout my studies like some kind of past failed class?

how can reality ever be found by seeking?

The nature of the miraculous ambrosia

Temicco said:
I've been somewhat skeptical of "practices" of liberation since I first got into Chan (how could liberation be confined to the enactment of a practice or produced through some method? It just doesn't make sense), but the fact that multiple groups within Buddhism ultimately agree just makes me feel kind of annoyed. If Dzogchen's where it's at (now that pure Chan is dead), why would I pay a Tibetan Buddhist centre to give me some raft to delude myself with? I'd really like to get to things directly, and it feels like that's an ideal that's impossible in reality. That my attachment to non-gradual teachings is something for me to investigate is definitely true, but doesn't really hit my main concern. Why am I expected and encouraged to tarry in samsara when I'm already interested in the dharma and want the heart of the matter?

The reason why you are in samsara is because you are afflicted. Most people have to gradually penetrate their afflictions. When they are free from being controlled by afflictions, they are liberated.

One of the reasons for the intensive use of grasslands is the high natural soil fertility. Grasslands characteristically have high inherent soil organic matter content, averaging 333 Mg1 ha-1 (Schlesinger, 1977). Soil organic matter – an important source of plant nutrients – influences the fate of organic residues and inorganic fertilizers, increases soil aggregation, which can limit soil erosion, and also increases action exchange and water holding capacities (Miller and Donahue, 1990; Kononova, 1966; Allison, 1973; Tate, 1987). It is a key regulator of grassland ecosystem processes. Thus, a prime underlying goal of sustainable management of grassland ecosystems is to maintain high levels of soil organic matter and soil carbon stocks.

In general, it is true. For example, the massive sod buildup in the midwest, before it was all dug up. It averaged 12 feet in depth and more, million of acres.

And it is not simple, "plant things" and heal the planet. One has to plant the right sort of things, and we really do not understand how to "grow a jungle" and create diversity. So, it is better not to destroy habitat in the first place. Conserve, not restore. Why? Restoration is actually impossible and comes with unintended consequences.

BTW, I am not defending lawns, since they are nothing like sod. And of course dry grasslands, are well, dry. But not all are, such as the Pampas in S.

Non-gradual doesn't mean a magic light switch comes on only once and you're completely finished unless you're of the highest capacity of practioners who has no need to stabilize your initial recognition.

Most of us need to recognize mind escence again and again until it's stable hence these auxiliary practices to help integrate the natural state.

Yantra can be a complete path in anf of its self if completely mastered, although the path of means is always to be accompanied by the path of wisdom.

steve_bakr said:
This seems like a wise answer in terms of stabilizing the natural state. A Tantra translated by Wilkonson as "The Tantras of Vajrasattva's Magnificent Sky" demonstrates the non-gradualism of the Great Perfection, and so does that called "The Supreme Source." These two seem to say that the ways of cause and result, of working towards a goal, are not the highest. Some even call meditation a hindrance when it has a goal in mind. They state that the natural state is not to be worked for, because it is already here. But stabilization of this state is very appropriate because there are many distractions.

Monlam Tharchin said:
So in sutras, you sometimes encounter lists of Buddhas, such as:
Shorter Amitabha Sutra said:
Shariputra, in the Zenith words there are Buddha Brahmaghosha, Buddha Nakshatraraja, Buddha Gandhottama, Buddha Gandhaprabhasa, Buddha Maharciskandha, Buddha Ratnakusumasampushpitagatra, Buddha Salendraraja, Buddha Ratnotpalashri, Buddha Sarvarthadarsha, Buddha Sumerukalpa, and Buddhas as many as the sands of the River Ganges

Monlam Tharchin said:
I'm not sure what to do with these lists.
Does each Buddha have its own practice/story/visualization that I should become familiar with, or is it sufficient to read the names as I chant the sutra?

Malcolm wrote:
It is sufficient merely to read their names.

Monlam Tharchin said:
Second, is it acceptable to chant the equivalent English translations of the buddha names instead of the Sanskrit?
Is there any reason to chant them in Sanskrit?

Malcolm wrote:
Yes. Though the Sanskrit is nicer.


Brah-ma-ghosha
Nak-shatra-raja
Gandh-ottama
Gan-dha-pra-bhasa
Mahar-chi-skandha
Ratna-ku-suma-sam-poosh-pita-gatra
Sa-lendra-raja
Rat-not-pala-shri
Sarv-ar-tha-dar-sha

All biographies of Nagarjuna explain that he went to the Northern Continent (sorry, my mistake). What evidence do you have that these are tall tales? Because you don't agree?

The biographies of Nāgārjuna are fanciful hagiographies (and you are only referring to Tibetan hagiographies, to the exclusion of earlier Chinese ones) written many centuries after his death. They are statements of faith, not statements of fact. In fact we know very little about Nāgārjuna as a person. Traditional sources frequently conflate Nāgārjuna of the MMK with later persons of the same name. But really, we don't need to know much about Nāgārjuna of the MMK as a person. His enduring legacy is found in the collection of reasoning and the collection of praises (excluding the Dharmadhātustava, which is clearly much later).

Surely someone who understands emptiness also understands that there are as many worlds and as many universes as there are living beings because everyone has individual karma and there is no inherently existent world? It's completely subjective and therefore for those who have the karma to validly perceive Mount Meru, Mount Meru exists.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course I accept that there are many worlds and universes, all formed out of the karma of sentient beings.

What I do not accept is that medieval Indian representations of Terra Firma ever depicted our own planet with as much accuracy as we have today.

There are so many inconsistencies: for example, the sun rises because it comes from behind Meru, and the moon sets because it moves behind Meru. But the reality is that even Indian astronomical math, concurrent with Vasubandhu, for example, excludes the possibility of Mt. Meru, which is why Hindus commonly located Meru at the poles (of course they never visited the poles, so they were speculating).

So just accept Meri cosmology for what it is a) an inaccurate representation of our world, an axial cosmology meant to describe the relative location of beings above and below the plane of the ground, according to their merit and leave it at that. Meru Cosmology cannot be taken literally, or conventionally. It is a best a moral metaphor.

It is quite possible Nāgārjuna went to Africa (the western continent), though unlikely, given that he lived in South-East India, in the Andhra region. The basis for the Meru cosmology is this planet, merely represented inaccurately in the imagination of some medieval Indians who did not have as accurate a geographical understanding of this world as we do today.

For example, both Ptolemy and Vasubandhu talk about the Kurus (Scythians), but by Vasubandhu's time (a good 6 centuries after Ptolemy's time, long after the Scythians had vanished as a people), the account of the Central Asian steppes and their peoples were so garbled in the imagination of some Indians, they wrote down all kinds of fabulous exaggerations about the Earth that we see in chapter three of the Kosha.

For example, many people make the mistake of thinking that Jambudvipa is the whole planet earth, when its descriptions clearly indicate that it is only a description of the subcontinent of India.

Thank you, I do appreciate the quotes. For me it is obvious that there was a lineage of Dzogchen Nyingtik  before Zhangton and that he was a lineage holder. Isn't it possible that some of the Vima Nyingtik is more kama than terma?

Malcolm wrote:
Zhangton makes it very clear that prior to him the utterly secret cycle was not promulgated prior to his revelation.  By this I understand his termas specifically to be the Golden Letters, Copper Letters, Agate Letters, Conch letters and Turquoise letters cycles, based on the index to the collection.

However, there are some texts which may have been bundled together with his termas, such as the four empowerments authored by Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, the Seventy-Four Fragments (which are a terma attributed to Chetsun), the Soaring Garuda of Śrī Simha, the so called Sems dmigs drug of Vimalamitra, The Seven-fold Trekchö, and so on which are included. However, some of these aforementioned texts are also found separately from the Volumes of the Vima Nyinthig. Thus, strictly speaking, for various reasons I consider the Vima Snyinthig to be comprised of the Golden Letters, Copper Letters, Agate Letters, Conch letters and Turquoise letters cycles, and therefore the termas of Zhangton.

There is no distinction whatsoever between nirvāṇa and saṃsāra."
MMK 25.19
Or perhaps more apt:

Malcolm wrote:
Chetsun was the teacher of Chegom Nagpo. Chegom Nagpo was the teacher of Zhangton. Zhangton spent one year with Chegom when he was eleven. His bio says:
...when he arrived, he met Guru Chegom Nagpo, Having pleased the guru, the latter said “Since this one is the arrival of an emanation of a buddha, you should give this one to me” and Tashi Dorje remained in his presence for one year.
As Zhangton says:

As such, thirty years later, having gone to the place where Chetsun disappeared, Chegom Nagpo of mNar mDa’ in Rong took out the outer, inner and secret oral lineage and the instruction was not promulgated to others apart from himself. These then spread widely in dBus and gTsang. Fifty years after the revelation by Chegom Nagpo, I [Tashi Dorje] removed these unsurpassed secret cycles and the instruction was not promulgated to others apart from myself.
After he left Chegom, he studied with 13 masters, and learned all Dharma topics, including secret mantra.

Zhangton Tashi Dorje was 18 when he revealed the Vima Nyinthig — this was eighty years after Chetsun took rainbow body. However, in Zhang's bio, after he revealed the Vima Nyinthig, it says:
Then, when he returned to gTsang, because he went up from Shangs and rTa nag, after he met with the siddha Senge Wangchuk on a bridge, he [Tashi Dorje] confirmed the ultimate three kāyas were inseparable, and having granted permission for the Dharma, [Senge Wangchuk] left and disappeared.
So basically, Zhangton received an entrustment of the teachings from Chetsun Senge Wangchuk in a vision. But they never met as two physical human beings. The relative connection between them was Chegom Nagpo.

BTW, these texts are directly from the Vima Nyinthig. This information was going to be part of my intro, but it was becoming too long. I have a book of Vima Nyinthig material, I will probably included it there. The later bios that state that Chetsun was the guru of Zhangton are not very precise. But the autobiography and the bios in the Vima Nyinthik itself are very precise and explain the situation very thoroughly. Not only did Zhangton have a visionary encounter with Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, he later had a visionary encounter with Vimalamitra:
After that, at one time when he [Tashi Dorje]  was invited to mTshur khungs by Loppon Nyergom. In the pre-dawn, when doing a ganacakra, he met Vimala, was blessed and granted permissions. [Vimala] left into the sky and disappeared. At that time Tashi Dorje was sixty-one years of age.

Without realizing the ultimate meaning,

In the second passage above, the first two lines explain the nominal ultimate; the second two lines explain the ultimate of realization.

In the next passage he warns against leaving the explanation of the ultimate truth (emptiness) as an intellectual theory:
When emptiness is seen incorrectly, 
those of little wisdom are destroyed,
like one who handles a snake incorrectly,
or practices a vidyāmantra incorrectly.

As such, thirty years later, having gone to the place where lCe bTsun disappeared lCe sGom Nag po of mNar mDa’ in Rong took out the outer, inner and secret oral lineage and the instruction was not promulgated to others apart from himself. These then spread widely in dBus and gTsang. Fifty years after the revelation by lCe sGom, I removed these unsurpassed secret cycles and the instruction was not promulgated to others apart from myself.

And his biography states:
After that, when he was living in the region of Sna khu in upper Nyang, before dawn there was a loud noise. Having arisen, he looked and in the sky there were rainbows, whorls of shimmering light, ḍākā and ḍākinīs, Mahākarunika, Tārā and the gurus of the past giving a prediction, “Listen! Amazing! The intimate instruction of buddhahood in a single life, the Dzogchen unsurpassed secret cycle is in a cliff that resembles a lion. The removal of that will have countless benefits for sentient beings.  The Dharma that is enough to meet is amazing, just amazing!” and then they disappeared. 

It is said that when he was eighteen years, Tashi Dorje did not understand the prediction. That evening, after thinking it over, a man wearing a white hat said to Tashi Dorje, “You will be given siddhi, go!”. 

That morning before dawn, [the man wearing a white hat] said “Go!”

Having left, that evening he arrived at Tsha ba Nyi ma mdar in lower Nyang. There were a group of many monks wearing yellow. Having sat, since he was given much food and drink, he wondered “That year there was a great famine. Should those be called siddhis?” 

Again at dawn [the man wearing a white hat] said “Go!”

Those monks were drinking a lot of alcohol, and having many dharma conversations, and it is said that they were content in prajñā, hearing and contemplation. 

Then, at noon he arrived somewhere, but he did not recognize the path. Again, he was guided by an upāsaka with a white hat. In the evening he arrived at sTag thabs, and just as he was lying down in an empty house, [the man wearing a white hat] said “Do not stay here, leave now!” and as soon as Tashi Dorje left the door, the house collapsed. 

That evening, a great rain occurred, and so that night he stayed under an overhanging cliff. The [the man wearing a white hat] emanation brought a lot of food and drink. 

Then, having crossed Rva lag tshugs, though there was a disturbance in the lower end of ‘O yug, since the emanation was fearless, on the day he reached “O yug, Tashi Dorje was extremely hungry and was given food by all the ladies who were cutting wood. Then he left and arrived at the base of a cliff that resembled a lion. After he became lost, he could not find it. He looked everywhere, but could not find it. He stayed because he could not return. Since he looked in the index, from the door where good grass was growing, in his hand he had a sharp weapon. Because he struck that [grass], the inside was revealed. Since he went inside, after sunrise he stayed in the center of a mandala. Since he dug with the sharp weapon, there was a mass of snakes and frogs all together. Having gradually cleared them away, he emerged above, and looked around, thinking in in his mind “Dharma is my expertise. If there is wealth, I will be happy.” Then, after producing one hundred and eight indexes, he danced from great joy. 

After that, he wrapped them all with a leather cord, and he looked in the cave of the valley. He could not see anything after dusk. At that time, again the upasaka brought light, food and drink and as soon as he looked at the books, the sound of a very terrifying voice arose in front of the door. “He is the emanation predicted for this, but older sister does not know him” and “I will and bring older sister.”
After that, at certain times, there were very terrifying voices, thinking that the cave was going to collapse, since his eyes fluttered, in front of the cave there was an an extremely terrifying eye the size of a skillet, a mouth of boiling blood, baring a single fang, of which he was frightened. He wondered why he was encountering this? 

Again, as in the prediction above, since he was not known by the older sister, she said:

I am Ekajati.
Offer one hundred and eight ganapujas.
Explain nothing for three years. 

Then she departed. That upāsaka with the white hat was Upāska Vajrasadhu. 

He blocked the entrance of the cave. Since there was a small piece of turquoise, with one man he offered cow meat and three bushels of barely for one hundred and eight feasts. 

In Nyang rTag rJed, he was greatly served by a faithful  benefactress named Shag mo dKar mTsho, and he was able to write down the books completely.
This is why I think so.

Well, this in an interesting point. I think we can say Sangye Lama was among the first tertons working with Guru Padsmabhava material, for sure. Most people consider termas to be teachings concealed by either Guru Rinpoche or the 25 disciples. For example, technically speaking, the Barchey Kunsel cycle was not concealed by Guru P, but rather by those disciples who heard that teaching.

Or, with Gongpa Zangthal, the cave of Zang Zag Lha drag was a place where people such as Padmasambhava, Mutig Tsenpo, Yeshe Tsogyal and so on would visit and conceal this and that teaching in five chambered casket taken out by Rigzin Godem.

There is a Tsasum Dilrup that has been given many times by Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche , I seem to remember it being a rediscovered terma  of Khyentse Wangpo originally from Sangye Lingpa , the first terton.

Malcolm wrote:
That is Sangye Lama, not Sangye Lingpa, and his claim to being the "first" terton (1000-1080 is a little arguable, since he had a younger contemporary, Trapa Ngonshe (1010-1090), who was also a terton.

Amazingly, Zhangton Tashi Dorje is always over looked in the lists of tertons, because for some strange reason, the Vima Nyinthig is never considered terma, though it is in fact.

Ok so if we can forgive Malcolm for muddying the waters by claiming that statements of the order "I like ice cream" are views, and can agree that views are "theories about the nature of reality", then do you agree with Nagarjuna that the Buddha taught the dharma for the abandonment of all views?

Malcolm wrote:
I did not claim that my friend, you did. I said at the outset that the "views" Nāgārjuna was critiquing were views of existence and nonexistence. If you respond, this is not all he was critiquing, that he was critiquing the four extremes, the second two extremes are merely repetitions of the first two: i.e., to say that something both exists and does not exits, is just a view of existence. To say that something neither exists nor does not exist, is just a view of nonexistence.

In the end, Nāgārjuna was aiming at views of permanence and annihilation, existence or nonexistence, which is why the only sūtra he cites in the whole MMK is the Inquiry of Kaśyapa. When the Buddha made such an argument against "yasti" and "nasti," he did so with respect to how things exist objectively. Thus it is entirely accurate to state that Madhyamaka is the study of the objective state of reality, whether or not there is such an objective state, a reality, and so on, or not.

Man ngag sde, for sure.

For example, most people have not understood that the song of the guidance of the six bardos is directly based on Dzogchen teachings. There is no teaching of four or six bardos outside of Dzogchen, not even in the Nyingma tantra cycles of Mahayoga and Anuyoga. The four or six bardos are based on man ngag sde.

Bakmoon said:
gad rgyangs, I really think you are making a big fuss over what boils down to a semantic issue. According to you, what is the definition of the word "view" when Nagarjuna says he has no views?

Does this mean that he has no assertions about anything or that he makes no positive statements about anything whatsoever? That's problematic because his writings make positive assertions all the time.

What I gather from Malcolm here is that the correct and more restricted sense of the term 'view' in this context is ontological views, not conventional views about how things function in a worldly sense.

gad rgyangs said:
Malcolm just said that to say "The Buddha is the best of teachers" is a view. so wtf are you talking about? I agree that views in madhyamaka texts do not mean "a statement of any kind" but rather a theory about the nature of reality. It is these that are to be abandoned, including the notion of emptiness, for as MMK says at 22.11

"Empty" should not be asserted.
"Non-empty" should not be asserted.
Neither both nor neither should be asserted.
They are only used nominally. (MK 22: 11)

I think the passage just cited makes it clear that Milarepa's Dzogchen practice was a failure.

Malcolm wrote:
Hahahaha, you think that was the only opportunity he had to practice and study Dzogchen? Milarepa studied with ten Nyingma teachers before he met Marpa, and did many years of retreat after Marpa passed on.

I don't think you can conclude his practice of Dzogchen was a failure at all. Why do you think he says he was "stabbed in the back by Dzogchen?"

smcj said:
As Cone and I have both been asking, other than that one song, can anybody find anything in his bio or other literature that substantiates that idea? If not then The last we hear of Dzogchen in Mila's story is his admitting failure and being motivated by that failure to start seeking out Marpa.

Malcolm wrote:
You have not carefully studied Mila's songs. For example, as I just pointed out, the scheme of the six barods is lifted directly from Dzogchen Man ngag sde.

The of course there is the song of the Dying Bonpo, where he treats themes of the great perfection quite explicitly.

But part of the problem is that you are not familiar with the teachings of Dzogchen, and so do not recognize them when they occur in Mila's songs.

Yes you can do both, put food on the table and respect the secrecy aspects of what you are studying. It comes down to motivation and what you are telling your students in class and your peers in papers. It might be good to emphasize that you are teaching and studying something that is a living tradition, something very much alive and of great importance to other people. It is not like a study of Attic Greek or the Latin of ancient Rome where he likelihood of causing offense is remote.

I had a chance to reflect on HH Dalai Lama's words that Malcolm summarizes, where the former "...discerned that in our modern society, secrecy creates hostility and suspicion." This seems a wise view in our increasingly crowded and linked-together world. You can teach things already in the public domain if you note they are not museum pieces but rather living practices of great importance to many. Respect for the field of study is always a good thing & not to treat it as an abstract notion.

Of course if you engage in the practices yourself your whole life and mind may change & you may find yourself in a different situation if not dilemma, but that's true for any intense Vajrayana practices.


Malcolm wrote:
We also need to bear in mind that we are, as a society, a great deal more literate than societies were 1000 years ago in general. As such, while our modernism may give rise to a certain level of conceptual complexity which can be a obstacle for sure, on the other hand, the learning curve is lower since literacy is not a barrier at all. If literacy forms a barrier, it is because we are very conditioned by our world view, and it then becomes very hard to overcome our education in science and so on.
