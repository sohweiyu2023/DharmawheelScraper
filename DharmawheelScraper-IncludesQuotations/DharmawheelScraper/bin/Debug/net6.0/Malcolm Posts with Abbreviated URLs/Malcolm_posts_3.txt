The gap between thoughts is a rather popular meditative tactics for the Theravadins as demonstrated below.
Space Around Thoughts

Take that simple sentence, “I am,” and begin to notice, contemplate, and reflect on the space around those two words. Rather than looking for something else, sustain attention on the space around the words. Look at thinking itself, really examining and investigating it. Now you can’t watch yourself habitually thinking, because as soon as you notice that you’re thinking, the thinking stops. You might be going along worrying, “I wonder if this will happen. What if that happens … mumble, mumble. Oh, I’m thinking,” and it stops.

To examine the thinking process, deliberately think something: take just one ordinary thought like “I am a human being,” and just look at it. If you look at the beginning of it, you can see that just before you say, “I,” there is a kind of empty space. Then, if you think in your mind, “I – am – a – human – being,” you will see space between the words. We are not looking at thought to see whether we have intelligent thoughts or stupid ones. Instead, we are deliberately thinking in order to notice the space around each thought. This way, we begin to have a perspective on the impermanent nature of thinking.

This is just a way of investigating, so that we can notice the emptiness when there is no thought in the mind. Try to focus on that space; see if you can concentrate on that space before and after a thought. For how long can you do it? Think, “I am a human being,” and just before you start thinking it, stay in that space just before you say it. Now that’s mindfulness isn’t it? Your mind is empty but there is also an intention to think a particular thought. Then think it; and at the end of the thought, try to stay in the space at the end. Does your mind stay empty?

Most of our suffering comes from habitual thinking. If we try to stop it out of aversion to thinking, we can’t; we just go on and on and on. So the important thing is not to get rid of thought, but to understand it. And we do this by concentrating on the space in the mind, rather than on the thoughts.....
Some even name that gap as "Bhavanga" but again its being disputed.

Patrul Rinpoche is not referring to the actual dharmakāya, per Ju Mipham:
From the perspective of the mode of appearance, the basis itself never ripens as the result, and since that non-ripening is not the actual dharmakāya, since this present basis is not the buddhahood that manifest the ten powers from the mere cause of the dharmakāya, it may be considered that “dharmakāya of the basis” is not "the actual one.”
Dharmakāya cannot be encountered between thoughts. Norbu Rinpoche was critical of the misconception that there was any benefit to investigating the alleged gap between thoughts at all. Even Zen masters like Huineng reject the idea of a gap between thoughts.

I’m not sure. It is Malcolm’s translation.

Malcolm wrote:
It's from Mipham's Original Mind (gnyug ma sems). Here is the rest of the citation:

When the appearance of the basis arises, when one arrives at the liberation of the initial state of original purity, since realization is manifest buddhahood, the ten powers are actualized. Therefore, though the qualities of non-abiding nirvana such as the ten powers and so on exist in the basis exist as a primordial endowment, other than those who have reached the ultimate realization, buddhas, when even the bodhisattvas of the tenth bhumi cannot see the manifestation of all qualities, what need is there to mention ordinary sentient beings? That being so, the difference between all the qualities of the basis being manifestly apparent or nonapparent is not from perspective of just the basis. [4/a] It is necessary to make a distinction in dependence on the appearances of a buddha, one who realizes the basis just as it is, and a sentient being, the one who does not realize that. That original basis that does not change at the time of either samsara or nirvana is “original” [gnyug ma]. Both the delusion and liberation which arise from its potentiality (rtsal) are adventitious. When there is no stirring from the basis, neither samsara nor nirvana appear.

This is more ofthen than not quite different from the stage of taking refuge. These more advanced stages have been described in many ways in the sutras, upadesas and commentaries. For example, you don't have to conceptualize any being as "samsaric", if you see that everything is from the start in a state of eternal peace or nirvana. You should not insist that "samsara exists objectively", because it doesn't. "Samsara" is only one of  several possible views of reality. There are other, far more advanced, views and experiences of reality.

Hello,

I have often heard or read that psychedelics can be very disturbing to a person's subtle wind. I have also heard that they can "open" a person's subtle system to other sentient beings, to the point of "spirit harm." However, I do not know how this precisely functions in the case of spirit harm. How can drugs open a person?

Conversely, I have heard that practitioners seeking to mitigate these negative effects (spirit harm) may engage in mantra, meditation, and even devotion. In the most extreme cases, I have heard that pracitioners will resort to the use of antipsychotics, but how does this function?

My present model for the function of antipsychotics is that the serotonin and dopamine systems are in a feedback loop with a person's wind. When a person disturbs them through psychedelic experimentation and contact with other spirits, that person may have an experience of never coming down (Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder [HPPD] or even Schizophrenia). Through the use of an antipsychotic, users are effectively rebalancing their serotonin and dopamine systems to a more baseline state, which has a corresponding effect in the subtle system.

Do you think people can have an abnormal subtle wind pattern which makes them vulnerable to spirit harm? Do you also think this abnormal wind pattern can find some of its causal underpinnings in imbalanced neurotransmitters?

Trying to understand this theoretically...

Thanks so much.

OK thanks Malcolm

Malcolm wrote:
I see this word "nihilism" bandied about by Buddhists as if they are clear about what the term means. This is largely a result of its misuse by Tibetan teachers who write in English. Nihilism is in fact moral skepticism: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism-moral/

The term in Sanskrit for people who do not believe in rebirth is ucchedavāda, "the advocation of cutting off." This is the philosophical view of the Carvaka school in ancient India. Often accused of harboring nihilist convictions, such materialists are not necessarily bereft of ethical concerns. For example, take Epicurus:

Konchog Thogme Jampa said:
Most prominent among the negative mental states is fear, above all the fear of unreal dangers, such as death. Death, Epicurus insists, is nothing to us, since while we exist, our death is not, and when our death occurs, we do not exist (LM 124–25); but if one is frightened by the empty name of death, the fear will persist since we must all eventually die. This fear is one source of perturbation (tarakhê), and is a worse curse than physical pain itself; the absence of such fear is ataraxy, lack of perturbation, and ataraxy, together with freedom from physical pain, is one way of specifying the goal of life, for Epicurus.

...

Epicurus held that a wise man would feel the torture of a friend no less than his own, and would die for a friend rather than betray him, for otherwise his own life would be confounded (VS 56–57). These are powerfully altruistic sentiments for a philosopher who posits as the unique goal in life happiness based on freedom from physical pain and mental anxiety. Epicurus could justify such an attitude by the same prudential calculus that he uses to argue in favor of living justly: only by living in such a way that loyalty to friends is perceived to be a consummate value will one be able to feel secure in one’s friends, and thus maximize one’s felicity. Yet this does not seem quite what Epicurus means when he says that “friendship [or love] had its beginning as a result of utility, but is to be chosen [or is a virtue, if we follow the manuscript reading] for its own sake”

Malcolm wrote:
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/epicurus/

Or we have the Confucians and Neo-confucians, who certainly do not accept rebirth, but who have a highly developed moral system of ethics:

Konchog Thogme Jampa said:
Zhu Xi’s methodology for achieving perspicacity (ming) in ethical judgment and “appropriateness” (yi) in practice can be summed up in his call to investigate things to extend knowledge (gewu zhizhi). Zhu advocated this methodology to stress the need for people, as prospective moral agents, to notice the fine details, the distinguishing features of particular situations and to fashion on that basis the most discerning, appropriate response. These distinguishing features can suggest alternative moral considerations to be weighed (Pincoffs 1986). This call lay behind Zhu’s promotion of the Great Learning (Daxue) and call for life-long learning and moral reflection in a bid to achieve a modicum of objectivity and break free of the moral intuitionism and resultant subjectivism typical of Neo-Confucians of his generation.

Malcolm wrote:
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/zhu- ... rEthDisPra


Finally, HH Dalai Lama says:

Konchog Thogme Jampa said:
Today, however, any religion-based answer to the problem of our neglect of inner values can never be universal, and so will be inadequate. What we need today is an approach to ethics which makes no recourse to religion and can be equally acceptable to those with faith and those without: a secular ethics.

...

To my mind, although humans can manage without religion, they cannot manage without inner values. So my argument for the independence of ethics from religion is quite simple. As I see it, spirituality has two dimensions. The first dimension, that of basic spiritual well-being—by which I mean inner mental and emotional strength and balance—does not depend on religion but comes from our innate human nature as beings with a natural disposition toward compassion, kindness, and caring for others. The second dimension is what may be considered religion-based spirituality, which is acquired from our upbringing and culture and is tied to particular beliefs and practices. The difference between the two is something like the difference between water and tea. Ethics and inner values without religious content are like water, something we need every day for health and survival. Ethics and inner values based in a religious context are more like tea. The tea we drink is mostly composed of water, but it also contains some other ingredients—tea leaves, spices, perhaps some sugar or, at least in Tibet, salt—and this makes it more nutritious and sustaining and something we want every day. But however the tea is prepared, the primary ingredient is always water. While we can live without tea, we can’t live without water. Likewise we are born free of religion, but we are not born free of the need for compassion.

On footnote 619, Walsh point out that the six reasons implies that Sakra must take rebirth again as a human being in order to attain awakening, and doubt must be held out that Sakra actually attained stream entry because of this passage:

Absence of metaphysical convictions does not equal absence of ethical and social concerns, in fact, it can make them more compelling.

Malcolm wrote:
I don't think it is far to claim that atheists are more at risk of nihilism than theists or buddhists, etc.

Annihilationism, the belief that there is no result of actions in the next world, does not entail the consequence that people with such beliefs are at risk of abandoning moral constraints. Kant's categorical imperative, for example, does not depend on fear of future retribution. Kant, it is argued, was an atheist. Yet his moral philosophy is quite subtle and interesting:

Konchog Thogme Jampa said:
Kant holds that the fundamental principle of our moral duties is a categorical imperative. It is an imperative because it is a command addressed to agents who could follow it but might not (e.g. , “Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.”). It is categorical in virtue of applying to us unconditionally, or simply because we possesses rational wills, without reference to any ends that we might or might not have. It does not, in other words, apply to us on the condition that we have antecedently adopted some goal for ourselves.

Malcolm wrote:
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant ... #CatHypImp

In my personal experience, Buddhists are no more likely to behave morally than nonBuddhists. For example, the 17th Karmapa recently paid millions of dollars to silence a women who accused him of raping and impregnating her.

And when Buddhist teachers talk about why we should behave ethically, it is never discussed in terms of behaving ethically for its own sake, and invariably because of the personal consequences of behaving immorally, such as taking birth in lower realms—this is what I mean when I say religious ethics are self-involved, they invariably turn on admittance to heaven or higher realms as the desirable result of behaving morally.

Kant's point is that morality and freedom go together, and are an end in themselves, separate from goals we imagine for ourselves.

Konchog Thogme Jampa said:
to act morally is to exercise freedom, and the only way to fully exercise freedom is to act morally.

Malcolm wrote:
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/#MorFre

Kant contrasts the categorical imperative mentioned above what he calls the hypothetical imperative, for example, avoiding breaking Buddhist vows in order to ensure a higher rebirth:

Konchog Thogme Jampa said:
A hypothetical imperative is a principle of rationality that says I should act in a certain way if I choose to satisfy some desire.

Also, he really comes across as an asshole (in my humble opinion).  The “atheist day,” is reflective of the new atheist have-it-both-ways idea. When told that they are being fundamentalists, many public atheists will say “no, not at all, it’s just a lack of particular beliefs and can’t be judged that way,” but then, they will treat it as a belief system when it benefits them. Of course, new-atheism is a belief system, because what it affirms to be objective truth includes many unproven assumptions of reductionist materialism. …which is why most of the “nones,” are not on Bill Maher’s side.

Atwood writes, "Between us, we ought to have created enough doubt to suggest the need for a reappraisal of Prajñāpāramitā philosophy."

This is a risible statement on the face of it. He imagines the whole of Prajñāpāramitā thought is encapsulated in the Heart Sutra?

Prajñāpāramitā concerns gnosis (jñāna), not emptiness. The 8k says it best, "Bhagavān, prajñāpāramitā is omniscience (sarvajñāna)."

His other errors, in the post you reference, are, first, the assertion that cessation is the end goal of practice, "Cessation is something we can systematically cultivate. The way to cultivate it is to minimise sensory experience, both in daily life and more radically in meditation." While I can sympathize with this Epicurean ideal, this sort of ataraxia is not the goal of Buddhadharma. The goal of Buddhadharma is not limiting the senses, but rather, eliminating afflictions.

Secondly, that there is some contentless awareness one is trying to reach. All cognitions are "contentless," just as all reflections are contentless. Again, his critique of Buddhist idealism is fine, but it is not unique, and it most eloquently stated by Longchepa.

A yogi should comprehend corrupt words such as these, and others, too, by reading the texts. Likewise, I must write this commentary relying on the meaning in order to eradicate conceit in proper words. Thus, Buddhas and bodhisattvas teach the Dharma for the sake of liberation.

In this way, yogis do not perceive an intrinsic nature in any entities, and therefore, they are liberated from samsara."

If consciousness must always have an object, such a nonperception would be impossible, and therefore, liberation also would be impossible, and one must accept the consequence that liberation involves consciousness becoming a nonexistent, and therefore, one's view is necessarily annihilationist, like that of sautrantikas.

If the unique qualities of an instance of consciousness is held to be uncompounded, the same can be applied to all dharmas. How is that any different from denying the emptiness of dharmas? Or even affirming a sort of ultimate awareness/self.

Malcolm wrote:
It’s quite different. The mistake many people make is assuming that uncompounded is the antithesis of compounded, when in fact all compounded phenomena have an uncompounded nature.

Minds also are conscious, but that consciousness is not fabricated by someone or something. Minds cannot be reduced in such a way as to exclude consciousness, consciousness is an irreducible fact of minds. Unlike inanimate phenomena, minds possesses two irreducible qualities, consciousness and emptiness.

All of which seems to be suggesting, if the ideal state for seekers of the highest mystic state of Buddha-enlightenment is one where even vegetarian food is avoided, how much the more, that of the flesh and blood of living beings.

Malcolm wrote:
This sutra is a Chinese composition. As the to other sutras, as I mentioned already, Bhavya proves in the Blaze of Dialectics that the teaching in the Lanka, etc., is not definitive, devoting many pages to explicating the difference between eating things in which there are minds and things in which there are not, and by definition, meat is something in which there is no mind, thus he concludes at great length that there is no fault in eating meat that is pure in three ways.

They literally apply the words of the Blossoming Lotus Commentary of the Tantra Without Syllables, applying them one-sidely. However, [the four cog bzhag] are to be applied in general. The Precious Appearance Handbook applies them to all."

The root of either trekcho and thogal is knowing how to nakedly expose this pellucid rigpa. If one does not know this, no matter what one applies is of no benefit. Since such a "trekcho" is lost in trivial methods of mental fixation through being mixed with the path of all confused great meditators, it will not transcend samsara and with respect to "thogal," one will deviate into the form realm due to clinging to entities and signs. Thus, it is very important here to recognize genuine, naked consciousness (zang ka rjen pa'i shes pa). It is not sufficient to merely recognize this, but one must constantly maintain this.

Longchenpa then goes onto describe the methods of equipoise, beginning with the cog bzhag of the ocean, and so on.

Natan said:
This literally contradicts what he says in Genuine Meaning, because he does not present them in the passage before or during tregcho, but as the preliminaries to togal.

Malcolm wrote:
The Tshig don mdzod is a commentary which expands on an earlier text, the rdzog chen bcu gcig pa by Nyi ma 'Bum (1158-1213), which Longchenpa had in front of him when he wrote the Tshig don mdzod.

His treatment of the four cog bzhags precisely matches its place in Nyi ma 'bum's earlier text, in topic eight, which is first of three topics the path (Buddhahood in this Life is identical to Nyibum's earlier text, apart from intro and colophon). This topic is divided into two sections, the section for those inclined towards perceptual objects and the section for those inclined towards the self-appearance of rigpa. In this presentation, the four cog bzhags are included in the section for those inclined towards perceptual objects, and they are distributed among the four yogas: view, meditation, conduct, and result. In this presentation, the four cho bzhags are presented in a gradual way, is if they are to be practiced one after the other, and they presented just before the section on trekcho.

The section on treckho and thogal are the section for those inclined towards the self-appearance of rigpa, and cover trekcho in terms of the three words of Garab Dorje, and thogal's four visions, postures, and gazes.

But the Chos dbyings mdzod is Longchenpa's declaration of his own realization, and its commentary, the Treasury of Citations (Lung gyi gter mdzod) is the last of the seven treasures and stands as Longchenpa's defining work. Everyone agrees this is so. The entire text is on trekcho, and it contains a detailed presentation of the four cog bzhag in chapter 10.

Not only this, but in his Theg mchog mdzod, his two volume detailed commentary on the general meaning of the seventeen tantras, Lonchenpa includes his explanation of the four cog bzhag in chapter 19, the Trekcho chapter, in the middle of a detailed presentation of the three words, in the direct introduction part.

The Treasury of Citations, which is entirely devoted to trekcho, devotes an entire chapter to direct introduction, chapter 9, and devotes an entire chapter to the four cog bzhags and three samadhis, which are branches of the latter.

Things like, space, rocks, cliffs, and so are compounded, but they too have a dharmatā. But since they are inanimate, their dharmatā is only emptiness. Sentient beings have mind, which has three dharmatās: emptiness, clarity, and cognizance (rig pa), which are in fact inseparable. The key here is to understand that since the mind is empty, it does not arise inherently, and thus, it cannot cease, and therefore, its clarity and cognizance are in some sense imperishable, even thought the mind itself is momentary.

• delighting in the negative action and undertaking it with joy,
• having no moral self-dignity or care for how our actions reflect on others, and thus having no intention of repairing the damage we are doing to ourselves and to them.

With Atiyoga also Anu and Mahayoga there is what is listed in Buddhist Ethics by Jamgon Kongtrul

With regards to individual Samaya given in Empowerments for example by Garchen Rinpoche and Sakya Trizin what factors protect those Samaya?

I have so many individual Samaya's from various Empowements that it is impossible to keep all of them all of the time.

Is it simply a case of reciting Vajrasattva to purify damage to the Samayas or applying the 4 Binding Factors listed above where Vajrasattva would be a means to repair?

Because it exists to be explained,
the result is attained through the explanation.
If not explained, how can there be liberation?

Tantra Without Syllables:
"Though the nature of vidyā pervades all, the dharmakāya is encountered in the instructions.”

ThreeVows said:
So then authentic realization of this pointing out of the pristine consciousness of vidya is the same as what is discussed here by Dudjom Lingpa, correct?
Ultimately, simply by identifying the dharmakāya, pristine awareness that is present in the ground, you gain power over the life force of saṃsāra and nirvāṇa. This is not a discussion of receiving empowerment through such things as water and symbolic pictures that are used as methods to awaken the mind. Rather, you know you have obtained the empowerments of the jinas and jinaputras and the oral transmissions of all the writings that emerge from primordial consciousness, pristine awareness.  Thus, you have already simultaneously obtained all empowerments and oral transmissions.

Ok, but as is discussed above with krodha, kyle dixon, and yourself, it seems like there is discusssion of this 'nominal' trekcho, which is not yet at the point of recognizing the nature of mind.

Malcolm wrote:
No. I have never said this. One cannot practice trekcho at all until one has removed doubt and can continue in the confidence of liberation. That means you must have confirmed the reality of the mind. Until that time, you use the methods of semzin and rushan until you have. Confirming the reality of the mind is not the same as realizing emptiness.

Krodha is Kyle Dixon, BTW.

You are also conflating what Kyle's restatement with what I actually said:

ThreeVows said:
Malcolm:

“The question is framed incorrectly. Treckhöd is best described in general terms as a practice in which insight into emptiness and śamatha are combined. But below the path of seeing, this insight is conceptual, based on the example wisdom of the direct introduction. However, the emptiness meditated upon in trekchöd is also inferential until one mounts the path of seeing. There really is no difference between perfection of wisdom, mahāmudra, Chan/Zen, etc., and tregchöd. I have heard it said that Tulku Orgyen asserted that trekchöd exists in all yānas, perhaps EPK would be kind enough to confirm this. What separates from trekchöd from these other systems of the method of introduction. Trekchöd, like any secret mantra practice, is based on empowerment/introduction.”

“Actually, what one is resting is empty clarity. However, below the path of seeing, the emptiness of that clarity is a conceptual inference. However, when meditating, we just rest in the clarity aspect without engaging in concepts like "this is empty." We know already that it is empty since we confirmed this analytically during rushan of the mind or the semzin of gradual and sudden emptiness.”
And so even if the dharmakaya is our basis, the 'pristine consciousness of vidya in which thoughts have ceased' presumably is not actually discerned unless one realizes the non-nominal, actual trekcho, at which point one is not an ordinary being at all.

Malcolm wrote:
This is yet another error of understanding. If we continue to insist on practicing Dzogchen according to the meaning of the nine yānas we will never get anywhere.

If ordinary people cannot discern "the 'pristine consciousness of vidya in which thoughts have ceased" then Samantabhadra is a liar.

Malcolm wrote:
In Dzogchen, the dharmakāya is our basis. It's already there. This has nothing to do realizing emptiness or not. The two issues are distinct from one another.

One need only confirm the reality of the mind and rest on that knowledge. Then the rest happens quite naturally. But this only works on the basis of hearing the intimate instructions of the guru. As it is said in the Tantra Without Syllables, "Though the nature of vidyā pervades all, the dharmakāya is encountered in the instructions.”

Vimalmitra states about this:

Similarly, though there is buddhahood in nondual dharmatā, it does not exist in one’s vidyā alone, which is insufficient. Likewise, a guru alone is insufficient. Also, one’s cultivation is insufficient. When these three things meet [vidyā, guru, and cultivation], buddhahood is a certainty.

Dzogchen is not a gradual path.

For clarification, sometimes it seems that trekcho is used in two ways - there is sort of a preliminary trekcho which does not necessarily entail direct insight into suchness/emptiness, and then there is sort of full trekcho which necessarily entails proper insight into emptiness, which would necessarily be the domain of the noble sangha alone as such.

No. It's the lamp. Lamps work in unison on either path and develop differently depending on which is followed. In fact Longchenpa specifically says Tregcho is not a prajna.

Malcolm wrote:
The term prajñā is used in various ways in Dzogchen. Trekcho is not an analytical prajñā, but it is a prajñā. For example, the Blazing Lamp Commentary states:

Therefore, in the present, wisdom arises the moment mere consciousness is without reification of thought.

Longchenpa writes in the Lama Yangthig trekcho manual:

In that state of momentary natural equipoise, dharmakāya is the reality of the pristine consciousness of vidyā in which thoughts have ceased.

And we know that on his deathbed, when people had doubts, he directed them to consult Lama Yangthig.

So we have to be clear that there is the analytical prajñā of the nine vehicles, and the self-orginated prajñā of Dzogchen. They are different. When Longchenpa negate prajñā, he is doing so in the same way Vimalamitra negates analytical prajñā of mental activity in the Tantra Without Syllables commentary.

So, I am fairly certain I know far more about Tibetan medicine than you do, since I actually practice it.

Meat is prescribed in four medicine tantras as food in the diet chapter of the explanatory tantra. Various kinds of animal products are also prescribed in the intimate instruction tantra as well as the subsequent tantra, and also the root tantra, for both diet and medicine, depending on context and condition. As in Ayurveda, there are four modalities in Tibetan medicine: diet comes first, then conduct, medicines, and finally external therapies, in that order. Diet and conduct are intended to be preventative, in the best case scenario.

And it seems like pronunciation can vary from word to word (not as bad as English though, obviously).  And the vowels are tricky as well...a vowel in the middle of a word seems to often be pronounced differently to if it's at the end of a word.  I know there are a lot of guides out there, both in book, YouTube video, and blog form, but just in case someone has any particularly good succinct, no nonsense, easy to understand recommendations.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct. The Snellgrove, Farrow/Menon, and Gerloff translations all rely on the Yogaratnamāla, and Farrow/Menon and Gerloff clearly depend on Snellgrove (who never received a single explanation of the text from a lineage holder).

On the other hand, in his commentary on the Hevajra Tantra, Sonam Tsemo comments on the vajra song, "Kolla and so on are explained according to the intimate instruction, not literally, [because] the meaning of the words have innumerable ways of being explained."

An attempt to read the text, or any tantric text, in absence of the intimate instructions which comes from the lineage is therefore completely spurious, and is just an exercise in forensic textual criticism, which is about the same as dissecting a cadaver in a morgue, and in many respects, just as ghoulish.

So, yes "those with compassion eat meat, those with samaya drink alcohol."

One way to benefit sentient beings is rest in a state of unification with that animal. Another way is to use a mantra such as the six syllables of Samantabhadra to plant a good cause. Another way is to use meat in a ganapuja, transforming it with mantra into amṛta. Vajrayāna is a path of special methods, not available to common Mahāyāna.

Malcolm wrote:
ChNN states in the book, Teachings on the Thun and Ganapuja:

"Accordingly, the Hevajra Tantra states, "Those who have compassion eat meat." In other words, if we refuse to eat meat on the grounds that eating meat involves harming the life of other beings, we are in fact rejecting the opportunity to give that animal a chance to join the path of liberation and this is not positive...Eating meat with compassion can benefit the animal and using mantra and visualizations, this can effectively create a positive cause for the animal. Thanks to the practitioner who has eaten its flesh, that being will one day find the path of wisdom and with that its transmigration in samsara will come to an end."

There is a caveat of course, is that the practitioner has to never eat meat in an ordinary way, and nor is this practice confined to a ritual context, as our friend opined. ChNN continues:

"Eating meat without distraction and in a state of awareness, as we do in the Ganapuja, creates a precise cause for liberation for that animal. How? When we eat meat we should have compassion, knowing that the animal has suffered in being killed for its flesh, and thus we eat with presence (dran pa) and awareness (shes bzhin). A serious practitioner who is experienced in contemplation creates a cause of liberation for an animal by eating its flesh with presence, and being, if only for a moment, in a state of unification with the poor animal. Those who do not have this capacity can at least create a positive cause for the animal by eating with awareness and by using the power of mantra. This should always be done, not just during the Ganapuja. Eating meat in this way eliminates much of its negative quality. So, for a practitioner who is aware and not distracted, eating meat yields more benefits than not eating meat."

Surely, outside of ganapuja, meat does not land on anyone’s plate by accident. You either have bought and cooked it for yourself, ordered it yourself or taken it yourself from a buffet etc. If the objective is to benefit slaughtered animals, practice can be done inside or outside of abatoirs, and liberation through hearing can be said in butcher shops and supermarkets without the need to participate in the economic transactions around meat production.

Malcolm wrote:
This is a false equivalence--if you buy a vegetable at a grocery store that sells meat...people imagine they can isolate themselves from samsara, but, one really cannot. Samsara is pervasive.

As for the other part of your statement, yes, this is true. It does not prevent one from buying meat however and eating it, since meat itself has no consciousness and does not suffer. As long as it is pure in three ways, there is no fault.

On the other hand, when one consumes the flesh of an animal with a proper method, according to my guru, ChNN, that being will be reborn in one's retinue when one attains buddhahood. So, there is also that. Hence his reason for saying that Mantra practitioners who refused to eat meat had "miserable compassion."

Someone is bound to ask now, why don't we eat every kind of animal or even humans? Convention, of course. And if you think about it, it takes a certain amount of merit to be born a domestic animal, even one destined for a slaughterhouse.

Most of the classical Mahāyāna Buddhist arguments against eating meat appeal to selfish motives: i.e. eating meat results in going to lower realms. Let that sink in. Then reflect on whether that sort of motivation, based on self-interest, is really consistent with Mahāyāna.

Thankfully, our own liberation does not depend on what kind of diet we choose.

There is no contradiction at all, apart from the contradictions your limited, and somewhat hysterical, imagination imposes. But I think it is sad that you feel that animals who have been killed in industrial farming should be be denied a chance for a positive connection through liberation through hearing based on your ideological and narrow-minded biases.

Anyway, I am not telling you what to practice, eat, or drink——you can do as you please.

The ones mentioned already praised vegetarianism even without modern farming methods.

Malcolm wrote:
Not really. Patrul called into question the whole of the food production system, including agriculture, as one massive exercise in cruelty.

But people do not read carefully nor in context. The context of this passage is the suffering of suffering. It is not a moral imperative:

When lamas and monks arrive at the house of a patron, the sentient beings killed by the patron are served after their flesh and blood has been cooked. Since the lamas and monks crave flesh and blood without any regret or compassion at all for the slain sentient beings, when they are served according to their pleasure, there is no difference at all between the patron and the recipients in terms of the misdeed of taking life. Also, when a great personage arrives somewhere, countless lives are taken for the purpose of tea parties and festivities. However many cattle and sheep a wealthy person has, in the end every one is slain when they get old. [120/a] Apart from the one or two that die naturally, countless lives are taken. 

In addition, in the summer those cattle and sheep eat many insects, bees, ants, fish, frogs, snakes, baby birds, and so on along with grazing grass. Countless lives are taken by trampling hoofs, within horse manure and urine, and so on. 
Among horses, cattle ,and so on, these sheep are a source of inexhaustible nonvirtue. As shown above, they eat all kinds of small creatures. During the summer wool season, there are one hundred thousand creatures on the backs of each sheep, and all of them are killed. All the ewes are milked. The lambs are killed for their meat and hides. All the rams are killed without exception. When sheep lice occur, one hundred million creatures on the back of each sheep are killed. Therefore that owner of one hundred sheep definitely will be born in hell one time. [120/b] 

Also, countless sheep are slaughtered when women are given farewell parties, welcoming presents, and so on after betrothals. Thereafter every sentient being that group returning to her home will be killed. In the same way, even when invited by friends and relatives, though given other food to eat, she acts like she has no appetite. That deceitful woman eats as if she does not know how to chew. But after each one of the fattened sheep are killed, having set a huge amount of ribs and intestines in front of her, that red-faced ogress sits right down, draws her little knife, and eats with relish. The next morning after loading up that fresh carcass, she returns to her home. Since she never returns empty-handed after going out, she is worse than a hunter. 

Also, countless creatures seen and unseen are killed during the playtime of children. Countless sentient beings are killed when picking grass or flowers. [121/a] Therefore, like ogres, we humans pass our time continuously engaged in the act of taking life. In one lifetime, having killed the female cows who kindly sustain us like parents with drinking milk for our use, we enjoy their flesh and blood. Upon reflection, we are worse than ogres.

And the context of this passage is the suffering of the conditioned:

The cause of all these sufferings is only nonvirtuous deeds. If this is illustrated, it is like tea and roasted barley flour. For tea, a seed is planted in China. When the leaves are pruned and so on, countless creatures are killed. Below Dartsedo, tea is carried by human porters. Each man carries twelve six-packs on their heads. Even though one can see the white bone where the skin of their foreheads has been rubbed off, they continue to carry the tea. Above Dartsedo the tea is loaded onto dzo, yaks, mules, and so on; those animals experience inconceivable sufferings such as broken backs, punctured lungs, and so on. Also when that tea is sold, without any consideration of promises or decency, business is done through deceit and fighting. [82/b] Also, most business involves sheep’s wool, lamb skins, and so on. 

When sheep are sheared, many creatures, smaller than a hair, such as ticks, tre le and so on exist living on the bodies of sheep. Most of those are decapitated, maimed and die when the sheep are sheared with a knife. Their internal parts protrude. Those who do not die are trapped in the wool and suffocate, resulting in birth in lower realms. Some lambs born when all of their sense organs are completely developed and so on are slaughtered for their skin. When one reflects on the causes and trade of such things, even a single sip is nothing other than a cause for lower realms. 

Also in pursuit of roasted barley flour, first, when one turns the fields, all of the insects under the ground are exposed on the surface.All the insects above the ground are crushed underneath. The mouths of crows and birds ceaselessly peck at the insects in the tracks of the plough beasts. Similarly, when water is led into the fields, all the creatures who live in the wetlands are dried and exposed. All the creatures who live in the drylands are killed bymoisture. Similarly when the seeds are planted, harvested, and flailed, countless beings are killed. If one reflects on those, it is like eating flowers made of insects. Similarly, even though the so-called “three sweets and three whites” such as butter, milk and so on are considered to be faultless, they are mostly products of slaughtered half-breeds, calves, lambs and so on. Even those who are not killed are tied at the neck as soon as they are born without being able to suckle even a sip of their mother’s milk. When they stand, they are tethered. When they travel, they are tied together. Whatever milk they suckle, the entire portion of food and drink is stolen. They are made to carry it. The nutriment of the mother’s body that sustains the life of the child is stolen. They are neither dead nor alive…They stumble when they walk, barely alive.

Similarly, when reflecting on everything that we consider happiness, the food we eat, the material we wear on our backs, all food and enjoyments are proven to be only suffering and nothing else. The final result of all these misdeeds that one must experience is endless suffering. Also, all appearances of present happiness are said to be the suffering of the conditioned.

Furthermore, of the four translations, three of them agree with each other and with the major commentary on how to render that verse...

Malcolm wrote:
There are eight major commentaries on the Hevajra Tantra, most important of which is Saroruha/Padmavajra's Padmini (Hevajratantrapañjikāpadminīnāma. Kye'i rdo rje'i rgyud kyi dka' 'grel padma can zhes bya ba, Dg.K, ka, rgyud, (Toh. 1181)).

My translation is based on Jetsun Drakpa Gyaltsen's interlineal notes on the Hevajra Tantra (Kye’i rdo rje zhes bya ba'i rgyud kyi rgyal po." In Sa skya bka' 'bum ma phyi gsar rnyed phyogs bsgrigs. TBRC W20751. vol 3, pg. 647. Lha sa: s. n., 1999).

In line with the Sakya oral lineage through Drokmi Lotsawa, Jetsun Drakpa Gyaltsen bases his own rendering on Saroruha's exegesis, which can be found on pp. 325-326 of the Padmini.

Thus, this is the standard set of interlineal notes on the vajra song found in the Medium-length Six-Limb Hevajra sadhana (on which I did a three year retreat 1993-1997).

Ha ha took this from my translation of that sadhana, which was recently published by Shambhala (Sakya: The Path with Its Result, pg. 179, Shambhala, 2022).

Chogyal Namkhai Norbu was raised in the Sakya tradition—as was I—and received this explanation—as I did. More than that, he received the explanation for all eight major commentaries. So, he was quite aware of the broad variation of exegesis of the Hevajra Tantra's vajra song.

Finally, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu summarized this teaching for us thousands of times: "Those with compassion eat meat; those with samaya (the diligent) drink alcohol.

stong gzugs said:
the fourth is wildly discrepant.

Malcolm wrote:
No, it is actually the normative version, based on the Padmini.

As for your quotes of Kun bzang bla ma'i zhal lung, you do realize that not only does Patrul criticize butchers, he also criticizes farmers for all the countless creatures they injure while farming and sheep-shearers for all the countless insects they mangle in wool?

Everything we do in this life is harmful to something, whether we intend it to be so or not. But I have long been of the opinion that the most strident vegetarians among Buddhists are actually former Jains reborn outside of India.

Following Bhavaviveka, we really do not have to avoid meat that is pure in three ways. He addresses the Lanka and so on. Those exhortations that even such meat is not pure are not definitive statements, quite clearly.

This is why Sapan can write in the Clear Differentiation of the Three Vows, pg. 66:

A disciple may partake of meat that is pure
in three ways; to refuse it would be 
on of Devadatta's austerities.
In the Great Vehicle,
meat is forbidden: meat-eating, it is taught, 
causes birth in the lower destinies.

Similarly, certain differences in what is allowed
and not allowed exist among the violations
against the codes of the Great Vehicle Perfections and Mantra traditions.
How could invariant sanctions and bans be reckoned
for such radically divergent systems? 

It is wrong, therefore, to apply
one-sidedly schemata of
invariant prohibition and allowance.

Malcolm wrote:
The tantra says, "those with compassion eat meat; those with samaya drink alcohol."

stong gzugs said:
Got a chapter/verse for that quote? I'd like to see the context. If it's purely within the context of the five meats being prepared in a ritual manner for the ganacakra ritual, I don't see how the text would therefore support other uses of meat-eating. I searched through Snellgrove's translation of the Hevajra for all references to meat/flesh and alcohol/wine and I couldn't find it. Most of the quotes I saw were about ganacakra and/or ways of obtaining lower siddhis.

Malcolm wrote:

stong gzugs said:
There also are some absurd consequences that might follow from this Dzogchen interpretation. For instance, you can have beef jerky for months/years before eating it. By the time you eat it and say the mantra, the animal would have already gone through the bardo realm and been reborn.

Malcolm wrote:
By the time one eats any meat the animal in question has already gone through the bardo.



stong gzugs said:
Does the reborn animal then disappear and rapture up to the realm of the devas when a dzogchenpa says the mantra? Or does the positive effect somehow last over an entire lifetime and then reassert itself upon death?

Malcolm wrote:
The effect lasts until the being is liberated as a result of the positive cause created by the dependent origination facilitated by the practitioner for that being. And, when the practioner attains buddhahood themselves, all those beings will be part of their retinue.

stong gzugs said:
What if the beef jerky cattle is reborn as a human, and the human does some really bad acts that should doom it to a hell-realm? Does the mantra from when they were eaten as cattle balance out the negative throwing a karma they accrued as a human, etc. This starts getting absurd very quickly.

But we don't apply the instructions for waking yoga to yoga of passion, do we? This is my exact point.

And I especially don't believe they claim that eating meat with a mantra will help liberate the animals we eat. I'm just asking for clear textual evidence from the Hevajra for where I'm wrong in these two claims. It may very well exist, I'm not an expert on this tantra. But I'd like to see it.


Malcolm wrote:
The tantra says, "those with compassion eat meat; those with samaya drink alcohol."

The yoga of eating applies to all meals one may have. Of course, if one is a practitioner, one cannot eat meat in an ordinary way.

And I didn't say that Hevajra Tantra has a mantra for liberating animals.

The Cakrasamvara Tantra however states that any being who comes into contact with a practitioner experiences positive causes for liberation. You might object, this refers only to living beings. But there are always traces in any being's consciousness which link it to its previous forms.

That mantra is from the 17 Man ngag sde tantras and is part of the system of six liberations, which are unique to the Dzogchen tradition. Liberation through seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and of course, thinking. There are many methods for creating positive causes for sentient beings. This is just one of them. It is a general mantra for creating positives causes. It can also be recited to any creature, living or dead to the same effect. It is not a mantra specifically for eating meat.

Yes, that's why I made the distinction between eating meat in the ritual context vs. eating it at KFC, following Dölpopa. We can all do the former, but there's really no need to do the latter as we don't live in hostile climates like Tibet. If you have quotes from the Hevajra that specifically condone KFC meat-eating, rather than meat-eating within ritual practice, I'd be surprised.

It's also the case that the five meats are supposed to be seen as disgusting conventionally, so eating them during the tantric ritual reveals non-dual wisdom (advayajñāna). That's not at all the same as eating well-prepared meats during everyday meals outside of a ritual context.

I can sum it up for you: ChNN stated this opinion to thousands of his students over the years—quoting the Hevajra Tantra to this effect thousands of times, and mentioning getting fast food for this purpose, hence the broad use of sausages in DC ganapujas, since more beings would be benefitted.

Eating is not a ritual, and ChNN made the point that we should eat meat because we understand the principle of benefitting animals through methods, not only when we are doing a collective practice. He said, thousands of times, Vajrayāna practitioners who refuse to eat meat have miserable compassion. You ask any DC person who posts here. They will confirm what I am telling you, 100%.

Ultimately we are to go beyond pure and impure in our choice of food, treating pink slime and pure sattvic food as the same. But, baby steps.

Advice against eating meat and drinking alcohol does not apply to Vajrayāna practitioners, it only applies to sūtra followers. This is why Sapan points out that what is forbidden to śrāvakas is permitted for bodhisattvas and vice versa, and what is prohibited for bodhisattvas is permitted for secret mantra practitioners. The three vows do not have one intention. And Longchenpa composed a hilarious and wonderful Praise to Booze.

Unlikely because Gobi desert conditions are harsh and too extreme to support large population of humans.

Indeed, in Thailand, so I’ve heard, people keep little ledgers where they record their acts of generosity, counting up their merit like so many coins.

Even in Mahayana, we are encouraged to accumulate merit, not merely for the benefit of others, but in order to benefit ourselves. Thus the claim that the merit of donations is purely altruistic might be true in the case of someone who has actually realized emptiness—such as yoursel, presumably—but the rest of us who are concerned with not taking birth in lower realms principally accumulate merit out of self-interest, hoping one day to secure the conditions for achieving the awakening which will largely not be realized by us in this lifetime.

Virgo said:
As it is by treaty, by barter, and by purchase, that we obtain from one another the greater part of those mutual good offices which we stand in need of, so it is this same trucking disposition which originally gives occasion to the division of labour. He frequently exchanges them for cattle or for venison, with his companions; and he finds at last that he can, in this manner, get more cattle and venison, than if he himself went to the field to catch them. From a regard to his own interest, therefore, the making of bows and arrows grows to be his chief business, and he becomes a sort of armourer. Another excels in making the frames and covers of their little huts or moveable houses. He is accustomed to be of use in this way to his neighbours, who reward him in the same manner with cattle and with venison, till at last he finds it his interest to dedicate himself entirely to this employment, and to become a sort of house-carpenter. In the same manner a third becomes a smith or a brazier; a fourth, a tanner or dresser of hides or skins, the principal part of the clothing of savages. And thus the certainty of being able to exchange all that surplus part of the produce of his own labour, which is over and above his own consumption, for such parts of the produce of other men's labour as he may have occasion for, encourages every man to apply himself to a particular occupation, and to cultivate and bring to perfection whatever talent.

That is probably the best one can hope for for the time being.

(I am speaking here as an organiser, not just a participant, btw.)

Malcolm wrote:
The problem comes here: where does sustainability end and commodification begin? I've observed ChNN raise 80k in 10 minutes. He gave himself a frozen shoulder to make trinkets, to be sold to raise money for Dzamling Gar, which are now so in demand that one cannot even purchase a key chain made by him for less than 1000 euros. FInally, ChNN was a privileged tulku from a wealthy family. His situation was not the same as Kunzang Dechen Lingpa, for example. KDL stated quite clearly that there were many instructions he could not receive because he did not have the required wealth to make offerings for this and that instruction. So the idea that the Dharma was all for free in Tibet is just not accurate.

Dont get me wrong, I support the idea of people being able to attend any event for free, means or not. However, I expect that people who have means will make a reasonable donation to support their teachers. Why? Because I have been trained that one should never receive a dharma teaching without making offerings, either through sustaining one's teacher by membership in an organization, or making a donation per teaching. So, I always make an offering in consideration of my means whenever I take teachings from another teacher. That is our culture in Tibetan Buddhism. It's does not matter much to me if it is framed as a "fee" or a "donation." These are just words.

What I am objecting to here is framing the discussion in terms of political economy, using labels like "neoliberalism" and so on, when it is so clearly obvious that we do not and cannot operated outside of the economic framework in which we live.

Malcolm wrote:

But this opens the question: do we really want Dharma Institutions to depend on the whims of an economic elite, as it has for the past 2500 years? Or do we prefer to have a more crowd-sourced model going forward?

Right now, Dharma Institutions are almost entirely dependent on capital gains earned in the market, which are donated by private, high value individuals. Previously, in every country, the Dharma was supported/sponsored by a small aristocracy who controlled primitive capital accumulations. In both cases, Dharma Institutions were controlled/sponsored by an elite who controlled private wealth. And yet, people are still encouraged to offer dana so they can earn merit, with virtually nothing returned to the local community, and everything going into statues, temples, and brocades. Buddhism does not even have a temple economy, like in the ancient mideast. Classically speaking, dana is nothing more or less than the nonproductive destruction of surplus value for an intangible: merit, punya, bsod nams. These days, large Buddhist foundations have investment portfolios.

And the market has a further role.  We have seen over the years fads of interest in various different lineages and teachings: from Kalacakra to Dzogchen and everything in between. Demand for some teachings increase and at the same time, demand for other teachings wane. We have seen, in the economic history of Tibet, institutional dominance controlled the supply of various lineages, leading to clear hegemonies of Dharma Institutions in various parts of Tibet. Not only this, but elite sponsorship of Dharma Institutions governed the spread and development of Dharma in disparate parts of the Buddhist world, from Śrī Lanka to Japan and everywhere in between.

Nothing much has changed, actually. Right now, the Robert Ho Foundation, Tsadra Foundation, Khyentse Foundation, etc. are almost entirely responsible for most of the funding of Dharma publishing, translation projects, and so on, in the West.

So when I hear people complain about "neoliberalism" in the Dharma, I have to chuckle, because any honest assessment of the situation must come to the conclusion that it is precisely the market society that is making the funding of Dharma possible today, because that is the global society in which we live.

So we have to work with circumstances.

You began by framing the discussion in terms of “neoliberalism.” Arguably, neoliberal economic relations, beginning with the British Empire, opened new territories into which  Buddhism could spread. Just as arguably, Islam provided a more efficient economic model which undermined Buddhism in Central Asia, Indonesia, and so on.

No one is in the Dharna to become rich, despite the millions of dollars a year the heads of lineages receive in donations and personal gifts.

In the West, we have a type of economic society that did not exist at the time of the Buddha. Everything here is done with money. No one brings gold, or their yaks and horses anymore as gifts to receive Dharma teachings.

There is only one way people can support the Dharna these days: either through volunteer labor or cash. If the Dharma you want to study is sufficiently important to you, then you will spend whatever is necessary for you to receive it, either by donating your time or cash.

People who care about the Dharma will support teachers, translators, yogis, and publishers. People who don’t, won’t. Supporting the Dharma is meritorious whether one is paying a subscription fee to belong to a program, like at Tara Mandala, or making a donation to 84000 or BDRC, buying a Dharma book, etc.

If you are worried about the program fee/price being dana, then just think of the program price/fee as dana and relax.

I get this and I grant it. If there are costs they need to be met. If it is a retreat for example, and food, accommodation is required, then of course a fee is necessary. Likewise a Dharma teaching that is large and may require the hiring of a hall or something, of course a fee is the best approach.

Still none of this touches my core position, which is that Dharma is highest gift. It is not overthinking to propose this, it is something the our tradition has long held dear.

Bristollad said:
the only fees I’ve ever hard to pay are to cover cost of the overheads: food accommodations materials venues etc.

I’ve never had to pay a fee for the Dharma.

I’m happy on top of those necessary fees to make a voluntary donation expressing my gratitude to the teacher, organisation and so on.  You say you understand the necessity of fees but seem to be suggesting it’s improper to levy them… I find your position confusing.

My position is that at times - as aforementioned - it is necessary to set a fee. But there are also many occasions when fees are not necessary, and this is the ideal.

Malcolm wrote:
Just to clarify things for you. I have no set fees for teaching. I also don’t have a bricks and mortar situation, no dharma center, etc. My point is a bit different. If someone is interested in a set of teachings, one will participate in the required manner. Thus, dogma about what is correct and what is not correct really should not enter into one’s decision making. If dharma is essential for you personally, you will do what it takes to receive it. That’s the point.

A common argument here seems to be: one's motivation for not paying for Dharma is stinginess, greediness or not valuing the Dharma, or valuing those who have put time and energy into cultivating the Dharma.

But this flies in the face of all the traditions who have striven hard and made so many sacrifices to **offer** the Dharma. There is a curious refusal or cognitive dissonance to look at this, and ask: why? Why has this been such a thing?

Malcolm wrote:
Tergar has 50k subscribers. They need a team to work full time providing services. Much of what they do is also supplemented by volunteer labor. But the full time people need to be paid, such as the technicians,  web designers, etc. They pull in roughly two million a year, and spend it.

Likewise, IMS, a major Theravadin organization, charges for their retreats. Here is the link to their annual report: https://www.dharma.org/about-us/annual-report/. It is clear from this link that in order to do what they do, they both need to charge for retreats and receive donations.

People might think Goeneka retreats are free, and they are, right up until you get lobbied hard in your final meeting at the end of the retreat, where strong pressure tactics are employed for donations.

The impossibility of escaping the logic of the market society is well framed by this Dharma organization:

https://static1.squarespace.com/static/ ... Report.pdf

Even where Dharma organizations charge, as we can see in the case of IMS, their fees are supplemented by donations, without which they cannot function.

My books are expensive. Why? It’s not because I make money from them, I don’t. They are expensive because the dignity of the Dharma demands that they be printed and hardbound with a slipcover. No one is sponsoring Wisdom books to make sure they are able to give away all of their books for free.

84,000 is making their library of translations available, but they are not in book form, and so we know they are ephemeral until printed. If our society collapses, those files on storage media go poof!

So, dana is nice, but for most large Dharma orgs in the west, it isn’t enough to make ends meet. If people can’t make ends meet, they won’t work for Dharma organizations and they won’t work on translations of Dharma texts, etc.

We live in the society we live in. So, we should work with our circumstances rather than engage in counterproductive and dogmatic moralizing about dana, and just do our best. In Buddhadharma, we don’t just do things because it is “tradition.” We use our wisdom to see what is best for promoting the Dharma. These days that seems to involve a combination of dana and set fees for most Dharma events and products. It’s just unavoidable.

As I said above, the implication that people teach or follow gzhanstong because they are weak/fragile is ridiculous given the long list of profoundly realized gzhanstongpas.

Malcolm wrote:
It is not as ridiculous as it sounds. Here's why: All gzhan stong pas admit that they are meditating on emptiness free from extremes when in nonconceptual equipoise. If one is not meditating on emptiness free from extremes in a nonconceptual equipoise, there is no chance one is going realize the path of seeing.

Thus, gzhan stong, like the tathāgatagarbha theory in general, is taught for the reasons listed in the Uttaratantra, in order to give people confidence in the Mahāyāna path, and also for the reasons given in the Lanka, in order to provide a on-ramp into Buddhadharma for those who are afraid of the profound emptiness of Mahāyāna. It is for this reason then it is a) criticized as being a transitional view between false aspectarian yogacāra and madhyamaka (Rongton), c) a distorted mashup of madhyamaka and yogacāra that misrepresents both (Tsongkhapa) and b) a view outside of pale of the buddhadharma (Rendawa), or d) a mildly eternalistic view (Gorampa) that is inconsequential if one is a Vajrayāna practitioner.

Politically speaking, gzhan stong tends to be a right wing view, if one follows the reasoning of Adorno's refutation of Heidegger in the former's Negative Dialectics.

Phillips Payson O’Brien strongly disagrees.

For example, this is you:

Although the Ukrainians almost immediately proved far more formidable than nearly anyone had anticipated, lulls in the war play to the expectation that Russia will soon start massing its supposed great reserves and recover the situation on the battlefield. The underlying assumption is that Ukraine has little hope of ultimate triumph over a fully mobilized Russia. In this account, the longer the war goes on, and the more rounds of forced conscription that Vladimir Putin and his military impose on the Russian population, the more decisive Russia’s supposed advantages will be.

This is the EU:

In recent days Norway, Finland, the Baltic states, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia have all promised continued support for Ukraine. These donors do not believe that NATO membership alone will protect them from Russian military interference; their security now hinges on Putin’s Russia being vanquished.

This is Ukraine:

Still, Ukraine has most of the advantages that typically decide a war. Its forces will be better trained, better led, and, with the West’s help, far better armed. And most Ukrainians’ determination is likely to remain strong, in part because they don’t have any choice but to win.

The notion that Buddha Nature just means emptiness is one view out of many, and one that I don't find particularly compelling. I quite like how Brunnhölzl described the 8th Karmapa's view (see also "When the clouds part: The Uttaratantra and its meditative tradition as a bridge between sutra and tantra.")
The Karmapa emphasizes that the tathāgata heart is the only ultimately real entity, which is permanent and able to perform functions (such as enlightened activity). He also repeatedly says that the tathāgata heart and sentient beings are mutually exclusive since sentient beings are nothing but the sum of adventitious stains. Thus, sentient beings neither possess nor are the tathāgata heart. This also means that it is not the case that buddha nature exists in sentient beings, but sentient beings (seem to) exist in buddha nature, just like clouds floating in the sky without affecting it.

Ukraine will have to make a deal and it will be a worse deal then the original peace deal. 250,000 soldiers are dead and generations worth of infrastructure was destroyed for nothing. Ukraine will be a failed state. NATO cannot build weapons fast enough. They are boutique and overpriced.

As to question 2. Yes, Russia’s defeat is completely possible.

As for question 3 and 4, that’s up to the Ukrainian people. I suspect that nothing short of the total expulsion of Russian troops from their borders are the terms, and the cost will be that if the Ukrainians do not prevail, liberal democracy in Europe is finished. This conflict is existential. That’s why, sooner or later, NATO will be fully involved.

Respect the signatory's independence and sovereignty in the existing borders.[6]
Refrain from the threat or the use of force against the signatory.
Refrain from economic coercion designed to subordinate to their own interest the exercise by the signatory of the rights inherent in its sovereignty and thus to secure advantages of any kind.
Seek immediate Security Council action to provide assistance to the signatory if they "should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used".
Refrain from the use of nuclear arms against the signatory.
Consult with one another if questions arise regarding those commitments.

However, to categorically state that receiving teachings from different teachers is evidence of lack of faith and not being serious is very limited, imo.

Matylda said:
Of course it is nothing wrong with seeing different teachers in the beginning; nobody expects from the newcomer to be aware of what is good for oneself. But there is time to settle down. Then one has to focus on one thing, one teacher, at least for some longer time; otherwise one will never learn anything. If a teacher who is reliable makes a strong remark, do not move, stay, and you will get proper benefit, then it is what one should do. Lack of faith is commonly spread in this world and time.

Malcolm wrote:
Hi Matylda:

Vajrayāna does not work the way Zen does.

Even if one is very committed to one teacher, in Tibetan Buddhism it is common practice to receive teachings from many other teachers, and is quite encouraged.

Most Vajrayāna practitioners have multiple teachers in multiple lineages, including David Stott aka Lama Jampa Thaye. Of course, if Lama Jampa Thaye does not wish to mentor people, who like himself, have multiple teachers, that's entirely his prerogative.

My personal approach to this issue is that I don't answer questions from students about transmissions they've received from other teachers. But it does not mean I refuse to discuss things with them or meet with them, etc. But my preferences are not everyones' and I would hesitate to negatively judge Lama Jampa, just as I would hesitate to judge the student who expressed dissatisfaction in being told that he or she, unawares, have entered into an exclusive relationship. There is no one right way here.

Ok,I don't really see what any of that has to do with drinking beer though. Nobody needs to drink beer. There is really no "nuance" when it comes to the 5th precept and alcohol. Either you drink it or you don't. If you do, then that's breaking it. Pretty clear cut.

Malcolm wrote:
Not so. There are many opinions on this in classical texts, and not everyone is in agreement that the precept regards the substance. If the precept is only against the substance, then other intoxicants are not included. If the precept regards intoxicated, then unlike some other drugs, alcohol can be consumed without becoming intoxicated. Also, there is an medical exception, and in Vinaya we find the Buddha administering medicinal alcohol preparations for ill bhikṣus. Likewise, taking psychedelics as a therapy for addiction, PTSD, etc., would not be considered a violation of the vow against becoming intoxication. You see, the vow states that one should not indulge in "madana," which can refer to alcohol, but refers in fact to any intoxicating passion, and in this context, the vow was created in relationship to a bhikṣu who became drunk and broke his vows by having sex with a householder women.

Simplistic reductionism does not help anyone. Likewise with lying. I am quite sure you would readily lie to protect someone or some animal.

The Shin perspective would be not to take these precepts that we are not likely to be able to live up to. It is worse to distort the Dharma and say that the fifth precepts actually does allow intoxicants in small quantities, than it is to admit that we are simply not capable of living up to that standard. If you can uphold the precepts, then by all means do, but if you can't, it doesn't affect your ability to be born in the Pure Land. Just don't twist the words of the Buddha to be convenient—alcohol violates the fifth precept and the bodhisattva precepts prohibit eating meat or the five pungent herbs. If we can't abstain from these, then that's on us: the precepts themselves don't need to answer for themselves.

Malcolm wrote:
The fifth vow is like the second amendment, it has various interpretations. But we can understand it is not at the level of four root precepts, since consuming alcohol for bhikshus, like harming plants or killing animals, requires only confession, with no attached censure or punishments.

Also, it can be adopted or not, according Sarvastivada.

And while there are certainly opinions that “not a single drop” is to be taken, other opinions indicate it us intoxication that is forbidden, not alcohol itself.

I truly don't know I Ching is connected with Dzogchen. Although there have been cases of people using the working principles behind I Ching to understand the interdependence nature of various phenomenons and hence Sunyata.

Malcolm wrote:
It has nothing to with I Ching, actually. There four kinds of cosmic tortoise in elemental calculation:

There is a cosmic tortoise of the abode, where Mañjuśrī acts a demiurge; cosmic tortoise of the basis, which produces all buddhas and sentient beings; cosmic tortoise of formation; a golden cosmic tortoise of existence (divided in method and wisdom):

It is at this stage for the eight spar kha form:

Next, the manner in which the Grandfather Sky and Grandmother Earth form the brother and sister elemental sequence, the eight figures marking the body of that tortoise of existence. The mist of the vapor of its mouth along with light produced Grandfather Sky as the pure element appearing as the character ☰ (khen). 
The external soil of the tortoise that drips down produced Grandmother Earth as the impure element appearing as the character ☷ (khon). 
Grandfather Sky and Grandmother Earth lay down together in a valley and based on the pillar of earth and sky made by a mountain, the eldest son and first child, Gin (☶), mountain, arose. 
Through the condition of wind arising between the rocky mountains, the eldest daughter Zon ☴, wind arose. 
Disturbed and spread by the wind, fire blazes, producing the middle daughter, Li (☲). 
The wind and fire fight, and since rain falls, the youngest son, Kham (☵) arose as the unclean hunchback water. 
Since trees grow between those, the youngest daughter, Zin (☳), wood arose. 
Earth melted by fire produces metal, therefore. the middle son, the cutting Dwa (☱), metal arose.

The way in which both Kham and Zin form: After the eldest son, Gin, and the eldest daughter, Zon, reached adulthood, having given rise to desire because of karma, brother mountain Gin circled Meru three times, and the eldest sister Zon circled the ocean. They both were unable to catch the moon, and since it wandered, in that valley where the rough wind of karma arose, in that country of the poisonous female demons (srin mo) called "The Primeval Blue Sky", the brother and sister came together and met without recognizing [one another] and through their incestuous union, Kham and Zin were born from incest.

Through that, after the gods and nāgās of existence fought, the eight classes of mundane gods and demons came from the mating or union of the gods and nāgās. Further, different shapes of their bodies and heads formed. In the same way, from the mating of the gods and demons, the region of the asuras arose in the crevices of Meru. Below it, when [the gods] mated with the nāgās, there formed the deformed paralyzed [zha grum mnol] gods. 

Since the gods exhausted their karma, those sentient beings fell into the human lands. and humans arose in the four main continents and the minor continents. And since they exhausted their human karma, also the three lower realms formed. Since birth and death occurs because of the power of affliction, the the six classes of existence of migrating beings is renowned to arise in order, and because of them, the eight trigrams form from the tortoise of existence.

This is all explained in much detail.

Further,

Because the eight trigrams separate because of such conflicts, the so called eight trigrams surround the outside of the golden tortoise. Through the state of their place, each trigram has a disharmonious direction that is like a demon, and also a harmonious direction, thus the eight trigrams are placed on one of the directions of the tortoise. For example, like Khen being attached to the left hind leg of the tortoise and the Mother Khon being attached to the left fore leg, the position of the formation of the symbols of the eight trigrams, clearly demonstrate the positions that occur at the start of many signs of black calculation.

As for Fu Xi:

Further, the first of the ancient kings of China, Sba hu hshi dhī (Fu Xi) saw a golden colored tortoise rise by the side of the ocean, and after examining it, the symbols of the eight trigrams arose in his mind. The calculations of Fire Li trigram is based upon that. Based on that, the kings, ministers and scholars gradually based themselves on that. In particular Confucius, the emanation of Manjughoṣa, known in Tibet as Kong tse ‘phrul rgyal, the instigator the limitless texts of calculation and gto rites and so on, is held to have very many treatises that appeared later on.

There is too much detail to give here, but it all based on the White Sapphire commentary by Desri Sangye Gyatso.

we dont steal, hurt anyone or have sex while having alcohol. we just talk a lot, laugh or sing silly songs.

from Mahā-Sudassana Sutta, The Great King Of Glory:
"Long ago, Ānanda, there was a king, by name Mahā-Sudassana, a king of kings, a righteous man who ruled in righteousness, an anointed Kshatriya, Lord of the four quarters of the earth, conqueror, the protector of his people, possessor of the seven royal treasures. This Kusinārā, Ānanda, was the royal city of king Mahā-Sudassana, under the name of Kusāvatī, and on the east and on the west it was twelve leagues in length, and on the north and on the south it was seven leagues in breadth. That royal city Kusāvatī, Ānanda, was mighty, and prosperous, and full of people, crowded with men, and provided with all things for food. Just, Ānanda, as the royal city of the gods, Ālakamandā by name, is mighty, prosperous, and full of people, crowded with the gods, and provided with all kinds of food, so. Ānanda, was the royal city Kusāvatī mighty and prosperous, full of people, crowded with men, and provided with all kinds of food.

Both by day and by night, Ānanda, the royal city Kusāvatī resounded with the ten cries; that is to say, the noise of elephants, and the noise of horses, and the noise of chariots; the sounds of the drum, of the tabor, and of the lute; the sound of singing, and the sounds of the cymbal and of the gong; and lastly, with the cry, ‘Eat, drink, and be merry!’"
...
“And whoever, Ānanda, in the royal city Kusāvatī were at that time gamblers, drunkards, and given to drink, they used to dance round together to the sound of those palms when shaken by the wind."

There is no admonition anywhere in the sūtras that the Dharma must be free. Quite the opposite, actually. There are reams of pages extolling the virtues of generosity. Material gifts are the primary dana of householders. If people, ordained or not, skilled in translation, explaination, composition, and debate are not afforded the leisure to engage in these activities, well, the world will be poorer in the Dharma.

What bothers some people is that they might be required to explain why they should be given free access to resources for which others are happy to contribute, regarding this inquiry as a violation of their privacy. They somehow regard Dharma education as different from other kinds of education.

The idea that Dharma should be free comes from this western idea of not taxing churches.

For example, the fees associated with becoming a Shingon Dai Ajari are prohibitive, which is one reason why only old men are Dai Ajaris in Shingon. Likewise, the fees for higher ranks in Soto, etc.

Jodo Shinshu priests charge money for rituals, like 2000 yen. Of course, this is peanuts. But the point is, they charge.

Also it is well known in Tibetan Buddhism that ritual lamas charge for their services.

Tibetan monasteries did not support monks. They were supported by their families, who also made large donations to monasteries. Some poor monks, of course, had to work menial jobs. Others chanted sutras on street corners for change, etc.

My teacher, Kunzang Dechen Lingpa, openly discussed the fact that many times there were teachings he could not attend because he did not have money. He just regarded it as his own lack of merit.

In fact, bitching about $$$ and complaining about this or that fee is, for a Vajrayāna practitioner, a kind of jealousy and envy, and is quite negative.

To sum it up: If you can't afford it, don't go. If you can afford it...

Recently saw an interview with Dr. James Mallinson and he stated that he's (controversially) of the opinion that Hatha Yoga has origins in Daoist alchemy.
He points out that the same alchemical language, symbolism, and understanding of the body found in the amritasiddhi can be found 200-300 years prior in Daoist texts. He also mentions that Indian Rasayana utilizes substances indigenous to China and Chinese Weidan predates the Indian Rasayana tradition.

I'm curious to hear what others might think of this. Personally, I lean towards this theory myself. You can even find things such as Utkranti-like practices in the Shangqing scriptures and Daoist mythology (the story of Li Tieguai).

PeterC said:
This sounds highly implausible.  I haven't watched the video - it's an hour long - but he'd need to do a lot better than the symbolism and understanding of the body, as although these look superficially similar, the functions of the channels, winds etc. are so different as to make it clear that you're dealing with two very different theories.

I meditate quite regularly as a side practice. I started recently vedic mantra meditation, in a similar vein to transcendental meditation.

I have found it a lot more therapeutic than anapana, at least in dealing with stress.

For those unaware, mantra meditation involves the silent repetition in your mind of a seed syllable, like 'Ram' or 'Aham', which normally has some sort of religious significance, (although meaningless words like 'one' also work just as well, according to neuroscientist Howard Benson.)

I was practicing the other day and suddenly had a flash of inspiration to change the mantra to the syllable 'Hrih' - which is associated with Amitabha. Thus enabling the meditation to get a pure land 'flavour'.

Has anyone heard of a meditation like this before? I'm cautious about experimenting too much and going off piste.

stong gzugs said:
Generally, there is disagreement about whether it's important to properly pronounce Sanskrit mantras in Tibetan Buddhism. There's a lot of interesting debate to be had here, and yes it is always good to follow your teacher, but you also deserve a simple answer to your question. So, whether you're on team vajra or team benza, here are the proper way to pronounce the Sanskrit

nyamlae said:
You provide the Western-style pronunciation, which is fine, but it's specifically in the "team vajra" camp.

Unfortunately for the OP, there's no neutral "proper" way to pronounce Sanskrit, so you really do just have to pick a camp.

Tibetans aren't really mispronouncing Sanskrit; they are following pronunciation standards that are hundreds of years old, laid out in the many Mantrasya Pathopaya (སྔགས་ཀྱི་བཀླག་ཐབས་) texts that are part of the tradition. Everything from the pronunciation of སྭཱ་ཧཱ་ as "soha" to the pronunciation of ཥ་ as "kha" are intentional, educated decisions. For example, see page 31 of this text (སཏྭ་ལྟ་བུ་ལས་སཏོཝ྄་ལྟ་བུར་བཀླག་གོ། "for example, from satva you should read satow.") or page 22 of this text (གཞུང་ལས་ཥ་ནི་ཁ་དང་ཆ་མཐུན་པར་ཞེས་གསལ་བས་ཥ་འདིའི་སྒྲ་ཁ་ཞེས་བཀླག་དགོས། "As is clarified in the classics, ཥ་ has the same aspect as kha, and so the sound of this ཥ་ should be read as kha.")

This work by Gendun Pal is actually quite late, he lived in 14th to 15th century, when the contact of Tibetans with India was quite limited already, so no wonder, that some mistaken pronunciations are presented as correct.

Not at all.  There is a difference between explaining what is taught in the text and guiding people who are interested in the teachings. For the former, one explains what they say. For the latter, one does not force beliefs on people.

Now in particular, since Dzogchen really cannot be confirmed through words, one does not have to believe anything. All the words of the mundane vehicles and the nine yanas are just abstract intellectual analysis, just so many words.

Since [dharmatā] is beyond the intellect, analysis, and words, 
it is seen with the sense organs, but not with wisdom (prajñā).

Nevertheless:

In the natural Great Perfection,
though the mind that has a referential view is exhausted,
sometimes [the view] is confirmed with words.

Malcolm wrote:
You are missing the point and creating a tempest in a teapot.

The Buddha never said to anyone, "If you don't accept rebirth, I won't teach you."

Buddha educated people about what he observed to be the principle existential issue facing human beings, suffering. He did not say first, "rebirth is suffering," he said first "Birth is suffering:"

"The Noble Truth of Suffering (dukkha), monks, is this: Birth is suffering, aging is suffering, sickness is suffering, death is suffering, association with the unpleasant is suffering, dissociation from the pleasant is suffering, not to receive what one desires is suffering — in brief the five aggregates subject to grasping are suffering.

https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitak ... .piya.html

He identified the cause as rebirth only in the second truth of nobles:

Adamantine said:
"The Noble Truth of the Origin (cause) of Suffering is this: It is this craving (thirst) which produces re-becoming (rebirth) accompanied by passionate greed, and finding fresh delight now here, and now there, namely craving for sense pleasure, craving for existence and craving for non-existence (self-annihilation).

It’s not clear why you present this after the prior sutra quote..though since you seem to be fitting them together I’ll reply accordingly. If birth was the only cause of suffering, and not rebirth, then the project of relieving oneself from the extremes of suffering in your version of a rebirth-free ‘samsara’, would be as simple as suicide.

Regarding this one statement of yours in particular, I have to admit I’m now even more confused. I certainly did notice you wrote “without the existential issue of birth in samsara”, I didn’t include that in the quote merely to be succinct. Actually, that was precisely what caused me to read it as referring to rebirth, since the term samsara refers of course to the harrowing continuity of cyclic existence..in which rebirth is naturally implicated.. there is no samsara without rebirth. To cite Rigpa wiki “Samsara (Skt. saṃsāra; Tib. འཁོར་བ་, khorwa, Wyl. ‘khor ba) is the cycle of conditioned existence, birth and death, which is characterized by suffering and in which one is continually reborn until attaining nirvana. ”
But of course you know this quite well, …so?

Malcolm wrote:
Birth has the consequence of suffering, whether one accepts rebirth or not. Everyone who is born ages , grows ill, and dies.

Saṃsāra basically means to wander around. In the context of Indian Buddhist texts, it means punarbhāva, rebecoming. But the Buddha never asked people to accept rebirth uncritically, rather than Buddha's discourse into free inquiry, we can call the Kalama Sutta the Buddha's version of Pascal's wager:

"The disciple of the Noble Ones, Kalamas, who has such a hate-free mind, such a malice-free mind, such an undefiled mind, and such a purified mind, is one by whom, here and now, these four solaces are found."

"So it is, Blessed One. So it is, Sublime one. The disciple of the Noble Ones, venerable sir, who has such a hate-free mind, such a malice-free mind, such an undefiled mind, and such a purified mind, is one by whom, here and now, four solaces are found.

"'Suppose there is a hereafter and there is a fruit, result, of deeds done well or ill. Then it is possible that at the dissolution of the body after death, I shall arise in the heavenly world, which is possessed of the state of bliss.' This is the first solace found by him.

"'Suppose there is no hereafter and there is no fruit, no result, of deeds done well or ill. Yet in this world, here and now, free from hatred, free from malice, safe and sound, and happy, I keep myself.' This is the second solace found by him.

"'Suppose evil (results) befall an evil-doer. I, however, think of doing evil to no one. Then, how can ill (results) affect me who do no evil deed?' This is the third solace found by him.

"'Suppose evil (results) do not befall an evil-doer. Then I see myself purified in any case.' This is the fourth solace found by him.

"The disciple of the Noble Ones, venerable sir, who has such a hate-free mind, such a malice-free mind, such an undefiled mind, and such a purified mind, is one by whom, here and now, these four solaces are found.

At the level of what we ourselves actually experience in our lives it is clear where transmigration begins; it begins in any instant in which we enter into dualism just as it ends when we rediscover the primordial state...

Chogyal Namkhai Norbu. The Crystal and the Way of Light: Sutra, Tantra and Dzogchen (pp. 90-91). Kindle Edition.

Some people think Dzogchen is about realizing some awakened state. It isn't. It's about cessation. Dzogchen is the third truth of nobles Recognizing the basis is the method we use in Dzogchen, but it isn't the end goal.

"Bliss" in Dzogchen is a negative definition, like the rest of Buddhadharma. It means we are no longer subject to suffering at all. When we have realized this state, then we can be of much benefit to others. Until that time, our ability benefit others is quite curtailed by our own limitations.

My current system ends with something like deity yoga and developing all siddhis.

That is why reading about Dzogchen and Boddhisattva the first time about year ago deeply affected me. It made a lot of sense when I was very confused.

I just don't agree we have to force people to become card-carrying Buddhists if they are interested in Dzogchen teachings. That is religion, not Dharma.

This requires some investigation, some diagnosis so we can get at the cause. But we do not have to have any beliefs at all to enter Dzogchen teachings. Along the way, it will become evident to us that we need to understand the cause of the three poisons, and so on. Along the way we will discover that the eight-fold path has right view, and right view entails not rejecting karma and dependent origination and so on.

I don't think you need to have any beliefs to be a Dzogchen practitioner. But if one is sincere about Dzogchen, one has to recognize that the solution posed to ones suffering involves the idea of the cause of suffering, karma and affliction. That one has to investigate for oneself. Being unsure of rebirth, which is something ordinary people simply take on faith, is normal. It is not disqualifying.

If however, someone claims that the teaching of rebirth is unnecessary, this is obviously false and attempts to remove rebirth, karma, and dependent origination, etc., as being key parts of the solution to suffering offered by Dzogchen teachings is incorrect. I have always maintained this, I maintained it then, maintain it now, and will always maintain it. I will also always maintain that one does not have to believe anything to practice Dzogchen teachings, because Dzogchen teaching is not based on intellectual analysis, reasoning, or words. If you find it dissonant that I have these two perspectives that are seemingly in opposition, I am sorry. But nothing has changed. You are only looking at one thing I wrote in 2012, not everything. You will never find one word where I negate rebirth, karma, dependent origination.

Correct. I stand by all these statements. "Beliefs" belong to lower vehicles.

However, Dzogchen sets out to resolve the existential predicament the Buddha pointed out, but without intellectual beliefs. If someone shows up at my teaching, I don't tell them they have to believe anything, or change what they do believe. My job is to teach them what they need to understand about their own nature, not condition them into adopting a new set of beliefs. Eventually, we can even drop the idea of karma if and when we can really be in our own nature.

However, there is no point in practicing Dzogchen if one does not take the four truths of nobles as a basis. If someone does not have the idea that there is rebirth caused by the three afflictions, there is no point in practicing Dzogchen, other than to have a more relaxed attitude in this life. Certainly all the teachings of rushan, etc., won't make any sense to someone like this. And as for relaxation, you can get that with the Calm app.

In the end, Dzogchen is about ending afflicted existence in samsara.

I recall the phase when you were promoting Dzogchen...entirely outside of Buddhism, or any religious container, in a quite absolute way.

Malcolm wrote:
The state of Dzogchen is absolutely outside of Buddhism or any religious container. Dzogchen tantras say so quite explicitly, such as the Sound Tantra:

Since [dharmatā] is beyond the intellect, analysis, and words...
the common vehicles will not accomplish the meaning
since dharmatā cannot be seen through words.

"The common yānas" refers to the nine yānas.

Now as a public teacher of Dzogchen, your presentation is much more traditional.

Sorry, but these are incorrect pronunciations. Tibetans mispronounce mantras because there are certain sounds they cannot easily make, like kṣa in in the middle of a word, or hriḥ without a sibilant added to it.

If you wish to know how a Tibetan highly educated in Sanskrit pronounces mantras, you should read Sakya Pandita's Flower that Produces Fruit (sngags kyi klog thabs 'bras bu 'byung ba'i me tog, https://legacy.tbrc.org/#library_work_V ... 3%7CW22271 )

Out of everything, it surprises me most that people got stuck with that particular statement. Even in the sutra system one of the most famous sutras conveys this meaning in a few succinct sentences (there is no path, no realization etc. - imagine the uproar here if Yeshi said that). Also some tantras end along the lines of "...but actually it never happened". And especially in Dzogchen, when you start your practice you need to discover something, and this something is beyond the concept of some entity traveling from one dimension to another assuming different bodies. It is not some secondary aspect, it is the very essence of practice. So it really surprises me that Dzogchen practitioners even start discussing that.

In fact, most Dzogchen practitioners attain their awakening in the bardo, after mind and body separate. It is for this reason such extensive teachings exist on the signs of death, and so on, and what the experience of the death and bardo process entails.

In fact, without the existential issue of birth in samsara, Dzogchen teachings are of no consequence at all, and completely lose meaning and relevance. This kind of “Ati lite (tm)” is just an empty lifestyle choice.

Also, if I continue my puja of the Hindu deities and keep following the Hindu rituals after taking refuge in the Buddha Dharma, which means I would still allocate a certain level of high respect to the Hindu Deities and system. So, would I consider the Hindu deities to be Bodhisattvas then? What would be the correct attitude to adopt towards the Hindu deities, scriptures, and rituals after the refuge?

As for your first question, ultimately, there is no Buddha apart from your mind. But there is also no contradiction between going for outer refuge to the Buddha and understanding that Buddha himself was pointing you to your state. So it us both.

We sometimes hear that vajrayana teachings are "self-secret"

Malcolm wrote:
It's mainly a Nyingma idea, criticized by Sapan.

However, it is legitimate and arises from the fact that unlike the meaning and practice of lower vehicles, the meaning and practice of Dzogchen teachings of the upadeśa class cannot be arrived at through words, analysis, or even through prajñā, but only through requesting the intimate instructions from a qualified guru. Thus, if you should pick up a Dzogchen text, without proper instruction you will not understand its meaning even if you think you understand the words and the meanings. This is what "self-secret" means.

Even though many Sakyapas do practice Mahasandhi, I don't see how any Sakyapa monastery would particularly benefit in an worldly way from recognizing the Tulku of a Guru whose previous Incarnation was known for only wanting to teach Dzogchen and little to no Sakya or Kagyu practices, and also whose previous Tulkus were associated with the Kagyu of Bhutan. Therefore, if this report is true, perhaps Chögyal Namkhai Norbu did change his mind about not reincarnating here again....

Malcolm wrote:
ChNN was also recognized as the tulku of a Sakya Khenpo. Not only that, but Adzom Drukpa's main teacher was affiliated with Sakya. Not only this, but HHST and CHNN were quite close.

I don't think this has anything to do with ChNN changing his mind. If the tulku is real, it is because ChNN's transcendent state is manifesting that effortlessly.

Some of the reactions here show that what should be taken for granted by now is still surprising or unacceptable to both them and some lay Buddhists.

I am with Keith in thinking it doesn't make any difference where the Heart Sutra was composed, but there is an entire edifice built on "all authentic Buddhism came from India", which had and has supporters in both China and Tibet, and to which challenges are either ignored or suppressed. The historical reasons for that are tied into motivations of authenticity and so power politics, so it's not always a trivial question.  Attwood is just frustrated by that, I think.

It’s important to note that nearly 100 years ago, on November 24, 1922, delegates from seven U.S. states gathered in Santa Fe, New Mexico, to sign the Colorado River Compact—and inadvertently set the region up for failure.

The delegates believed the average Colorado River stream flow was 16.5 million acre-feet per year. So, their agreement apportioned 7.5 million acre-feet of water annually to provide for growing cities, industrial applications, and irrigation for farming in what they hoped would be a sustainable way. This would allow the remaining 9 million acre-feet per year to maintain the Colorado River ecosystem. Or so they thought.

The instrumental stream-flow data they employed to inform the compact came from a 22-year period between 1900 and 1921. In an almost unbelievable twist of fate, the Colorado River enjoyed a significantly higher stream flow during that 22-year period than at any other period in the last 500 years! We now know this through tree-ring analyses.

Compact signatories therefore legally bound themselves to unrealistically large allocations because their input data, unbeknownst to them and by sheer chance, came from an anomalously wet period in the climatic history of the U.S. Southwest. People in the region have been dealing with the consequences of this ever since.

It seems highly unlikely that the compact will be renegotiated given the current political climate. Politics may supersede nature in the short run, but Mother Nature will rule in the long run.

Well, the concept of Adviya (ignorance), initial link and I would say that the principal of dependent origin (since if this does not originate), not only develops in Buddhism. Also in Advaita Vedanta is a central theme.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, no actually. Shankara basically embraces the Samkhya model (with qualifications):

Śaṅkara argues that prior to universe emergence, when all objects, time, and space, are unmanifest, only primordial undifferentiated existence exists (see ChUBh 6.2.1–2 for example). This existence is a single potential cause free of form; but even after the universe emerges, there is still just that single cause. It persists through all objects and causation, like the clay persists through its changing forms.

https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/shankara/

The idea that there is a single cause stands in direct contradiction to dependent origination. Further, this position of Advaita is also rejected by the Buddha:

Following his readings of the Upaniṣads, Śaṅkara identifies īśvara as both the material and intelligent causes of the universe (BrSūBh 1.1.2). Īśvara emanates the universe through a cosmic causal power (māyāṣakti), and is the very process of becoming itself, a beginningless cycle of universe manifestation, sustenance, and dissolution. This process is an auto-cosmogony, making īśvara the material of the universe. As nothing but īśvara, the whole universe is sentient and self-aware. (See Ram-Prasad 2013; Comans 2000; Hacker 1995; and Warrier 1977 for further discussions of īśvara).

In any case, all these ideas of liberation are not commensurate with one another, let alone commensurate with liberation as defined in Buddhadharma. Indeed, Hindus who accept rebirth have a completely different understanding of karma and rebirth, so as to render their notions of samsara entirely dissimilar from that of the Buddha. Jews and Confucians don't really have an idea of an afterlife; we all know about Christianity and Islam and their notions. None of these ideas are compatible with dependent origination/emptiness.

Disagree. Apart from Buddhadharma, all the other spiritual and philosophical traditions are either eternalist, annihilationist, or fail to be concerned with liberation from the cycle of rebirth at all

It is not the "technique," it is the lack of adequate training and preparation, as well as an approach to meditation that view it as a technique. Since people often jump into "meditation" without sufficient grounding in the Buddhist psychosomatic model, which applies in all traditions from Hinayāna through Dzogchen, as well as being lead by "teachers" who are insufficiently grounded in this model, and not being informed that meditation itself is not a panacea, and in fact, has hazards (all described in traditional texts, mainly vata aggravation, BTW), it leads to problems.

Protestant Buddhism’ is a label that has been applied to certain progressive elements in the Theravāda tradition, first in Sri Lanka in the 19th century, and more recently to modernist Buddhism in this country and around the globe. It is sometimes used as a pejorative, to the extent the enterprise is regarded as tainted with orientalist and colonialist attitudes, along with the historical Euro-centrism that led the first western Buddhists to immediately begin the task of “improving upon” the traditional manifestations of Buddhism in Asia. Another point against it is its tendency to downplay or even marginalize the role of the ordained Sangha...

Let’s look at some of the parallels. In ancient India the Brahmins held specialized sacred knowledge of the Vedic hymns, and were the only ones qualified to perform the rituals needed for the well being of the population. The entire Śramaņa movement was a rebellion against this privileged information, and the Buddha, like other wandering ascetics, taught that anyone can gain direct access to spiritual understanding by practicing meditation and understanding the Dhamma for themselves. This is much like the Protestants in Europe by-passing the Church and empowering people to study the Bible for themselves and forge their own meaning from it directly.

Actually, if you study what Gautama Buddha said, there are some passages where he did not explicitly reject the idea of a self, but rather the question whether there is or is not a self based on the argument that the whole discussion around the topic is simply not helpful.

It is fascinating how many Buddhists heavily make use of the argument of no-self to demonstrate that they are "completely different" from Vedantins, hence ignoring those passages.

stong gzugs said:
We actually have supportive data on this now. A professor did a statistical analyses of the Pāli suttas and found that anatta is only mentioned in 378 of these 5,126 discourses (about 7.4%), which can be compared with 368 for the Noble Eightfold Path, and 340 on the jhanas. So, it's not unreasonable to think that most of the Buddhists alive during the time of Buddha never heard the notion of anatta.

Doing a further analysis, the doctrine of anatta was actually mentioned significantly less often when the Buddha had a Brahmin as an interlocutor (across lay Brahmins, wandering Brahmins, and ordained monks who were Brahmins). In 394 discourses that involve named monks who were Brahmin, only 10 monks are aware of the anatta doctrine, and only one sees an atta as being outside the pale of Buddhism. Instead, much of the teachings to Brahmins of all stripes was focused on jhana and the Eightfold path, which were portrayed as the fulfillment of the Vedic path, not a refutation of it.

There is a lot more richness in the analyses, but the author basically provides good reason to think that the Brahmin/Buddhist distinction wasn't originally at all what we pretend it was today and that there were basically distinct canons for distinct audiences. If you know anything about the debates in the Theravada world around concentration and insight, you can see how this dynamic still plays out to this day.

Joseph Walser said:
When Did Buddhism Become Anti-Brahmanical? The Case of the Missing Soul

Many textbooks for Introduction to Buddhism or World Religions courses treat Buddhism as a competitor of either “Hinduism” or “Brahmanism” by asserting that Buddhism teaches that there is no eternal self or soul and Hinduism teaches that there is. I ask whether these assumptions hold up for one of the earliest sources about Buddhism, the Pali canon. Using statistical analysis of 5,126 suttas or “discourses,” I argue that there is little evidence that the doctrine of soullessness was preached to “convert” representatives of the Brahmanical tradition to Buddhism. On the contrary, it would appear that Brahmin Buddhists had their own canon-within-a-canon that simply avoided the topic of soullessness. Rather than seeing the canon as “what the Buddha taught,” the argument here will present canonicity itself as one of the stakes in a nexus of power where different communities strove to assert their version of Buddhism to be “what the Buddha taught.”

Samkhya, as presented in the Gita, is not a view of dependent origination. Why? Because it presents matter as a mere transformations of three gunas in one substance. So it does not compute.

stong gzugs said:
From the early suttas, I take the core import of dependent origination to be a series of links in a chain that show how ignorance and attachment produce rebirth and suffering, and thus how we can interrupt the chain (various forms of non-attachment and equanimity). In this sense, dependent origination and what the Gita describes have the same core import.

But, from a madhyamaka perspective, I take the core import of dependent origination to be inherent-emptiness. In this case, as the Gita is describing these links as fluctuations of prakriti's guna-qualities, the links don't reduce down to inherent-emptiness, because prakriti can still be taken as a substance that is not inherently empty. Hence dependent origination and what the Gita describes don't have the same core import here. Is this what you're getting at?

Malcolm wrote:
Samkhya and Buddhism begin with the same observation : suffering is produced by ignorance of how things are and liberation Is produced by knowledge of how things are. Where they diverge is in understanding how things are. Samkhya predates the Buddha, and he was knowledgeable in it, according to the Buddhacarita. Samkhya supposes that effects exist in the cause, this can never be compatible with dependent origination, and indeed, the Sarvastivadin interpretation of “everything exists in the three times” was taken to task by the Sautrantikas because it veers dangerously close to Samkhya.

The basic point is that Advaitans, and Hindus in general, reject dependent origination. No Buddhists reject dependent origination

stong gzugs said:
Not sure this is accurate. Although the exact links differ (and, indeed, there are multiple versions of dependent origination in the early suttas), the basic idea of dependent origination is presupposed in Vedanta. For instance, the Bhagavad Gita 2:62-62, traces the links from sense contact to a loss of buddhi and rebirth in samsara:
While contemplating the objects of the senses, a person develops attachment for them, and from such attachment lust develops, and from lust anger arises. From anger, complete delusion arises, and from delusion bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, intelligence is lost, and when intelligence is lost one falls down again into the material pool.
The difference is that vedantins believe there's a self that exists outside the field of "dependent origination" that is fundamentally untouched by it because it's the knower of the field, so we have to distinguish between the field and its knower (i.e., kṣhetra-kṣhetrajña-vibhāga). So, my revised take would be that, Hindus work on dependent origination from the outside (by resting in the atman and witnessing it from that vantage point), whereas early Buddhists describe cutting off its chains from within (and typically deny that there is an "outside").

Well everybody has so his/her Tsawe Lama and all Bönpos have as Dzogchen Yongdzin , Lopon Tenzin Namdak Rinpoche.
That are a lot of Bönpos, i would say so.

But everything, which is based on Tibetan "Buddhism" is valid here, and everything which smells suspicious is wrong.
That is what is going round here, isn´t it ?
Yes,  this is a Buddhist forum, and on a Bön forum we would  have other valid statements, of course...........

Further, the Bön Yongdzin Rinpoche, has an excellent knowledge about Dharma matters and exceeds here, regarding quality, some prominent "Guru´s" here. He is the highest authority, when i may state that. What Rinpoche states is for all Bönpos a fact, except for non-Bönpos like you are.
Maybe you should listen to your higher inherent Wisdom and do not make discriminations, with the backing of your friends here.

I was thinking of J.D. Vance, the newly-elected junior US Senator from Ohio and author of "Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis" (2016). He came from a dirt poor Appalachian background, made it to Yale, and is now a rabid R.

The book was very interesting to me, as I was exposed to that milieu for a number of years; it's a pretty accurate representation of the vicious nature of some families. Their blatant self-interest can be the overriding motivator right up until a threatening outsider appears, then they close ranks.

After reading the book I kind of hoped that Vance's exposure to a different culture might be a positive influence, but apparently he hasn't changed a bit.

He’s an interesting character.  He’s not stupid.  He has a better understanding of the issues of his people than anyone around him in politics.  So there’s a few possible interpretations of his political affiliation. One is that his emotions are motivating his reasoning.  He feels betrayed by the democrats, because rather than stand up for the working class poor (many of whom are white) they seem to ally with a particular group of white elites and court the votes of the non-white poor.  Another possible explanation is more cynical, that he recognizes that a career in politics begins and ends with gaining and maintaining power, and the republicans simply do that much better than the democrats.  I suspect there’s a bit of truth in both these explanations, but primarily the first one.  The democrats are not the party of the working class white poor.  Nobody is.

Chandrakirti's emphasis on emptiness and Nagarjuna's emphasis on appearance, taken together, are the inseparability of appearance and emptiness.

“The Republican Party in the House is deeply divided, and they have a number of members who not only don’t like their party’s nominee for speaker, but are willing to block that nominee on the floor – and in doing so, break a norm that has been followed for a century,” said Matthew Green, a professor of politics at Catholic University in Washington, DC.

“The problem is…this isn’t just today. This is going to be everyday in the House Republican majority,” Democratic Senator Chris Murphy wrote on Twitter on Tuesday.

I didn’t say it was a fact, I said it was a possibility. There is an snyan brgyud in Man ngag sde which also uses a scheme of six lamps, and has similar terminology. Then there is the fact that the tantras this snyan brgyud are related to, such as the thig le kun gsal, describe the smooth white nadi, and so on., terminology absent in the 17. The snyan brgyud lineage splits from the 17 tantra lineage with Chetsun, who gave the snyan brgyud to Shongpa Repa, while he passed the 17 on to Chegom Nagpo. These two lineages were reunited in Kumaraja, who passed them onto Longchenpa, who systematized them in the Lama Yangtik and the Zabmo Yangtik. My present belief is that the six lamps system was borrowed into ZZNG after Chetsun.

Also ZZNG uses once the Indian term, brighatu, which is found in the 17 several times.

Hopkins is (accurately, as far as I can tell) describing Tsongkhapa's view as saying the two truths are the same thing ontologically (ngo bo gcig) but different conceptually (ldog pa tha dad), where "ldog pa tha dad" is what he translates as "different isolates." Dölpopa views the relation of the two truths instead as different in terms of negating an identity (gcig pa bkag pa’i tha dad). It's not straightforward or unanimous among various schools how to understand the relation of the two truths, and Gorampa takes the same view as Dölpopa (gcig pa bkag pa’i tha dad) as he sees them in terms of two different modes of cognition.

Other than that, the first bio of him, the mdo ‘dus, was revealed by Shenchen Luga in the early 11th century. The other two bios, zer mig and gzi brjid, are much later termas. While they certainly frame a narrative of a prehistorical, mythological Shenrab, the idea that these tell the story of a actual historical person is absurd, with no more credibility than the exaggerated narratives concerning Garab Dorje, Manjushrimitra, Shri Simha, and Vimalamitra. The difference however, is that we have firm historical evidence for three of these four persons.

Of course we have no evidence for the Buddhas prior to Shakyamuni other than mentions of them in the Pali Canon, etc., datable, as we know to around 100 BCE. So, while I am happy to concede that historical evidence apparently has no impact on tendencies of Bonpos to make ahistorical claims, just as we do, when it comes to history, we need to rely on empirical evidence, and that is entirely lacking for most Bon historical claims, unlike Buddhist claims.

Explanation by: Acharya  Pema Tsewang

Shentong views the two truths doctrine as distinguishing between relative and absolute reality,
Agreeing that relative reality is empty of self-nature, but stating that absolute reality is "empty" only of "other" relative phenomena, but is itself not empty.
This absolute reality is the "ground or substratum" which is "uncreated and indestructible, non-composite and beyond the chain of dependent origination."
Dolpopa identifies this absolute reality,  with the Buddha nature.

Then Buddha Nature has  an "Identity" and never a boring "self".

stong gzugs said:
I was generally with this until the line about "identity." I'm not sure what that means. Dölpopa uses the term "self" at times in ways that are entirely consistent with the buddha nature sutras (like the Mahaparinirvana Sutra), but I don't know what it means for buddha nature to have an "identity." It does have positive qualities, but that isn't an identity.
The view quoted above is an extreme view and is seriously flawed. The two truths are inseparable.

The relationship of the two truths is a bit more complex for Dölpopa. It's wrong to say that you can't differentiate between the ultimate and conventional, as there clearly is some difference between the two, such that they are not the same entity.

When i first got in touch with spirituality i got the books from Eckhart Tolle and afterwards some books on advaita vedanta and following satsangs on youtube. The i or ego is very stigmatized by ET and AV. It is the biggest culprit according to them and must be banished. So i got " brainwashed" and i unconsciously mix/projected it on dzogchen. If i think about it i cannot really recall dzogchen to be so talkative about the ego, it just says to not grasp or reject any phenomena. So probably this also goes with the ego, to let things be as it is, no grasping or aversion/not accepting or rejecting. If this is correct what i say, than it is a fundamental difference in practice between contemporary non duality circles and dzogchen.

So, the basis is a blank canvas that karma plays out on to give rise to everything, in conjunction with said blank canvas' ability to cognize and perceive stuff. Can it be said like that?

Then my question would be, is it possible in dzogchen, for practitioners, this illusory self that is now the current manifestation of the day, to control how the next display that arises will be? For example, if I am dreaming one night and I decide I would like to continue the story of that dream the next night, a skilled lucid dreamer can do so. Can a dzogchen practitioner do the same for their subsequent life? Such as if they decide they have unfinished business with people whom they have connection with in this life and would like to continue to see that story through.

https://himalaya.socanth.cam.ac.uk/coll ... _29_01.pdf

Also Padmasambhava certainly commented on the nine yānas as modes, nayas, in his commentary on the 13th chapter of the Guhyagarbha Tantra, which is an Indian text.

Such texts as the Cuckoo of Vidyā, Great Space of Vajrasattva, the Contemplation of Bodhicitta, all can be traced to the 8th century and Bagor Vairocana.

And you keep on ignoring klong sde. This is also a system in which postures and gazes are used, that are not at all like the positions used in togal. It is an oral lineage, not a terma systems, which also has historical masters like Dzeng Dharmabodhi (1052-1168), also a contemporary of Mikyo Dorje, etc., texts, and a long history, and also goes back to Śrī Simha. Dharmabodhi received klong de when he was 35, so in the year 1087.

To that end, I'm not well-versed on the latest research, but as far as I know from Germano's work, there is no clear evidence that any independent tradition called Dzogchen or Atiyoga existed outside of Tibet, and there is certainly no evidence that tögal (or its postures) were ever practiced in India.

Further, there is no doubt his teacher and Garab Dorje actually lived.

stong gzugs said:
The oral tradition of Yumo Mikyo Dorje described by Tāranātha thus provides the best evidence we have, to my knowledge, that these "tögal postures" can even be traced back to India, even if they are originally Kālacakra postures. Now you're correct that we don't have texts from Yumo that mention the postures. But Yumo, like his intellectual successor Dölpopa, wasn't a big fan of dzogchen. So the idea that he'd borrow the practices from there seems unlikely.

Malcolm wrote:
You are excluding the possibility post Dolpopa borrowing. Why? That's quite arbitrary, especially when we have a text of certain mid 11th century provenance (roughly 1040) which explicitly names these postures. How can you justify that as being anything other than pure bias? The old, "My father's cup is the best"?

stong gzugs said:
But there's more. The only time Yumo even mentions dzogchen, is in his Brilliant Lamp of Mahāmudrā, and he attributes to it an inanimate emptiness, which might imply that the visual practices of the instruction series weren't established at that point, as clearly the instruction series isn't an inanimate emptiness.

Malcolm wrote:
Or he was never exposed to any Dzogchen teachings and just relied on early gsar ma misrepresentations

Unknown said:
There are also some who maintain, Mahāmudrā is the Svātantrika Madhyamaka’s clearing away of appearances or the Prāsaṅgika’s Collection of Reasoning, or the vacuous view of emptiness of the Dzogchen, which is a view of inanimate emptiness, or the emptiness of annihilation. They think these approaches are more profound than the tantra vehicles that teach mahāmudrā as luminosity. If you think mahāmudrā is like that, it is not.

Malcolm wrote:
You do realize that you just placed Yumo squarely in the late-eleventh-early 12th century, right? Hatchell dates his birth as 1038 ( https://www.thlib.org/encyclopedias/lit ... -dorje.pdf ). But this is unlikely. Why? The person who introduced the terms prasanga and svatantra as Madhyamaka categories was Patshab Nyima Drag (b. 1055). Patsab returned to Tibet in 1101.( https://www.academia.edu/87233424/Intro ... makakārikā ). This terminology that he introduced will absolutely date any text written that mentions these terms after 1101, considerably later.

If we accept Hatchell's dates, Yumo passed away in 1118. It seems unlikely he would have been aware of the new fangled Madhyamaka. There is also considerable doubt about Somanatha's dates. Kalacakra itself was not completed until the period between 1025-1040. Newman points out that Somanātha and Dro were principally active in the third quarter of the eleventh century; 1050-1075. This is well after Dangma came into possession of the 17 tantras, etc. So, basically, your chronology does not add up.


Unknown said:
So Yumo was obsessed with visual experience in meditation, was familiar with Dzogchen, and doesn't see Dzogchen as having a visual practice, but an inanimate emptiness. All this is evidence that Kālacakra visual practices predate those of Dzogchen, likely including the tögal postures.

The fourth vision is the exhaustion only of all obscurations. From a Dzogchen point of view, the appearance of five lights is a result of the contamination of the potential of vidyā with karmavāyus. But one does not have to do thogal to exhaust those. Trekcho does the visions in reverse.

Tāranātha's point is that tögal is about lhundrup and trekchö is about kadak; this is attempting to fuse together two different principles.

Malcolm wrote:
They are not two different principles. Trekcho concerns the basis. Thogal concerns the path. Thogal isn't necessary, and most people practice it primarily to become familiar with the experience of the bardo of dharmatā. There is no practice for attaining buddhahood in the bardo in Kalacakra, as far as I know. There is no practice for avoiding the bardo of the six realms if one misses the luminosity at the moment of death, as far as I know. Dzogchen has methods for buddhahood in this life, the moment of death, the bardo of dharmatā (where most Dzogchen practitioners attain awakening), and through shutting the door of the womb by attaining birth in the natural nirmāṇakāya buddhafields.

If people become attached to lhun grub through thinking the visions are real or ultimate, they will block their practice. But it also because gzhan stong falls into the error of asserting the basis is only lhun grub, not the union of ka dag and lhun grup, aka, ka dag chen po.

I think this is getting to the crux of the difference! "Purity" in dzogchen is, in essence if I understand it correctly, just inherent emptiness as a non-affirming negation.
Emptiness, in Dzogchen, is freedom from all extremes. The Sound Tantra commentary states:

As such, this Great Perfection is superior to other vehicles. It is not incomplete, and since there is no other vehicle higher than this, it is called great. That has never arisen from the beginning. Since it has never arisen, it does not persist in a present arising. Since it does not persist, cannot possibly perish in the end, thus it is called a. As such, it is impossible to shift out of the Great Perfection.  Since one has already been liberated, there is no reason for liberation to be repeated. {310} Since that is self-liberation, there is no antidote. Since that is liberation merely by being seen, the present consciousness vanishes by merely seeing liberation through recognition. Since one is liberated by resting on that, one is beyond effort. When one is liberated, one is like a garuda chick hatching from the egg. Since there is nothing to transform because one is liberated through key points, it is called ti. Completely perfect and inclusive, one attains buddhahood without being lost in the universe and beings because of depending on the intimate instruction which reverses the direction of samsāra and nirvāṇa. Since samsāra and nirvāṇa are reversed, all phenomena arise as dharmatā. 

As such, total perfection free from extremes is even superior to the Great Perfection, called “freedom from the four proliferations.” Free from the extreme of existing, emptiness transcends identification. Free from the extreme of not existing, the circle of the luminosity of one’s vidyā transcends the extreme of annihilation. Freedom from both [existing and not existing] transcends grasping the extremes of permanence and annihilation. Freedom from neither [existing nor not existing] lacks bias and falling into extremes. Likewise, because of being free from all extremes, such as appearance, nonappearance, both, and neither, clarity, obscuration, and both of those extremes, being, nonbeing, and so on, no extreme at all is fallen into, and further, there is freedom in total perfection without abandoning the principle of freedom [from the four proliferations]. Because of being free as self-originated, no effort is required. Because of being free as intrinsically perfect there is nothing to negate or prove. Because of being free in self-liberation there is no antidote, and because of purity in intrinsic purity, there is original purity. Because of being free in a self-appearance there is no need to search for dharmatā. Because of being free in self-arising, activities are transcended. 

As such, because of having always been free, there is no reason for a repeated liberation. Because of being free by nature, do not look at the extreme of before and the extreme of after. {311} Because of being totally perfect, there is no need to abandon anything. All [dualities] such as appearance and emptiness, permanence and annihilation, samsāra and nirvāṇa, and so on, do not transcend dharmatā. That being the case, directly perceived dharmatā manifesting to directly to oneself through the key point of total perfection is called “liberating samsāra and nirvāṇa at the same time.”.

BTW, I won't responding to this thread. It is too time consuming.
