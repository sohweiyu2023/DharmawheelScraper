Some people insist that one needs to append "inherent" to the above formulation, but it is not necessary, in fact.

Perhaps I’m misinterpreting it, but it sounds to me like the main point is not to impose Madhyamaka as a scientific model. Rather it is to show that, with quantum, western science could be aligning more closely with an ancient Buddhist understanding of reality.

Malcolm wrote:
The resistance comes from the fact that Madhyamakas are impartial with respect to presentations of relative truth. Their only interest in with respect to presentations of relative truth is when those presentations make claims which contradict the principles of dependent origination.

This is the reason for example that followers of Bhavavivkea and Candrakirti largely follow the Sautrantika presentation of relative truth, apart from Sautrantika tenets like partless particles and so on that that conflict with reason and are found to be irrational assertions upon analysis.

In Madhyamika philosophy, particles do not inherently exist on their own right. Particles arise only in dependence upon causes and conditions, in dependence upon their parts, and in dependence upon the mind that apprehends them.

Malcolm wrote:
This is only conventionally true. When particles or their arising is sought, neither particles nor there arising can be found. For example, in the refutation of motion, Nāgarajuna states:
Apart from having moved or not having moved, [at present] there is no moving.
Arising particles cannot bear this analysis. In other words, to address your statement"
Apart from having arisen or not having arisen, [at present] there is no arising.

Kenneth Chan said:
This would correspond very well with the mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics. The quantum wave function of a particle would correspond to the “causes and conditions” aspect, and the eigenstate and its corresponding eigenvalue would correspond to the experiential event of the mind experiencing the particle. Neither the separate inherently-existing particle, nor the separate inherently-existing mind appears in the mathematical formulation. What does appear is the experiential event, where the conscious experience and the particle appear as a combined reality. These experiential events are what actually make up our reality.

Malcolm wrote:
The same applies to experience:
Apart from having been experienced or not having been experienced, [at present] there is no experiencing.

And since, these arbitrary concepts lead to problems in interpreting quantum mechanics—problems that still remain unresolved to this day—it is probably wise that we remove them from our direct experiential interpretation of quantum mechanics.

Hi Astus, Malcolm, and Conebeckham. Please allow me to address all your questions together.

The situation with quantum physics is really quite unique. What the physicists have discovered is a mathematical procedure, called quantum mechanics, that enables them to calculate very accurately the probability distribution of possible results of measurements made on a particle. The big problem is that we have no idea at all why this mathematical procedure works. Sounds amazing but it is true. No one knows why it works. That is why Richard Feynman openly admits that no one understands quantum mechanics.


Malcolm wrote:
If it works, it is conventionally true. It will still not hold up to ultimate analysis.


Kenneth Chan said:
But the problem does not end there. What this mathematical procedure, called quantum mechanics, tells us is that whenever an observer makes an actual measurement, our external reality changes. This process is called the collapse of the wave function. What it means is this: If the observer does not make a measurement, the external reality behaves in a certain way. If the observer does make a measurement, the external reality will behave in a completely different way!

Malcolm wrote:
Yes. Meaning that entities are conditioned by our perception of them.

I think it is worthwhile for Buddhists to look closely at quantum physics, and I believe that is also why His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, presided over the recent conference on Madhyamika philosophy and quantum physics. Take a look at the title of this article on the conference: "Dalai Lama: Religion Without Quantum Physics Is an Incomplete Picture of Reality" ( http://motherboard.vice.com/read/dalai- ... of-reality ). So I believe His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, would encourage Buddhists to look more closely at quantum physics, since quantum physics is telling us what our reality is really like.

What my paper shows is that there is something even better than just parallels or intersections between Madhyamika philosophy and quantum physics. Madhyamika philosophy can actually solve the mystery of quantum physics—by interpreting the actual formulation of quantum mechanics explicitly in terms of the Madhyamaka view of reality. Looking at it the other way around, it means that there is now concrete scientific evidence that Madhyamika philosophy is correct. I have deliberately written the paper in such a way that Buddhists, who may not know any mathematics or physics, can also understand it—with a bit of effort, of course. (The paper can be found at http://kenneth-chan.com/physics/direct- ... mechanics/. I would, of course, be happy to clarify things further on this forum if required.)[/quote]

Hi Malcolm. The point here is that there is no current interpretation of quantum mechanics that is actually fully functional. All the current interpretations have conceptual problems and inconsistencies.

Malcolm wrote:
Then from a Madhyamaka point of view they fail the functionality test, and this means they are not valid. However, as long as some of the predictions made by quantum models are functional, then we can accept those as conventionally true. Conventional truth does not need to be completely true, otherwise, it would stand up to ultimate analysis.

Kenneth Chan said:
However, if we interpret the formulation of quantum mechanics in terms of the Madhyamaka view of reality—i.e. that all things are empty of inherent existence because they are dependently arisen—we can now actually obtain an interpretation that is free of inconsistencies and free of the need to add on further ad hoc conditions to the basic formulation of quantum mechanics. That is what I am talking about.

Malcolm wrote:
These quantum models can only be accepted as conventional if they make predictions that turn out to be valid.

But it's not a legally binding thing like liberals think.

Malcolm wrote:
Our agreements with the WTO etc., are very binding. For example, there was a law in Massachusetts that barred trade with Myanmar over human rights violations . It was challenged by the WTO and Massachusetts lost, because:

BuddhaFollower said:
Massachusetts officials were flummoxed to learn they were required to comply with WTO procurement rules that they had never approved.  They later learned that a previous governor had sent a letter to the USTR during the Uruguay Round without legislative consultation, much less approval which was the basis for the claim that the state was bound to the WTO procurement rules.

However, the EU and Japan suspended the WTO case pending the outcome of a federal lawsuit filed against that state by the NFTC in U.S. District Court.  The NFTC argued that the Massachusetts law “unconstitutionally infringed on the federal foreign affairs power, violated the Foreign Commerce Clause, and was preempted by the federal Act.”[ix]   The District Court permanently enjoined enforcement of the state law, ruling that it “unconstitutionally impinge[d] on the federal government’s exclusive authority to regulate foreign affairs.”[x]   Massachusetts appealed, but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision.

Massachusetts appealed to the Supreme Court.  Seventy-eight Members of Congress, 38 state and local governments, all eight major state and local government associations, and 66 non-profit organizations filed amicus curiae (“friend of the court”) briefs supporting the Massachusetts law.[xi]   Nonetheless, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts’ decisions, although on narrower grounds, holding that a state or local selective purchasing law sanctioning a nation is preempted only when Congress has passed a corresponding law sanctioning that nation – as Congress had done in the case of Burma – and only when the two laws differ.  This leaves the door open for state and local governments to pass several other types of laws.

For example, state and local governments could enact general laws to avoid purchasing goods and services from companies that violate human rights or labor standards as long as the laws do not apply specifically to companies doing business in a country where Congress has adopted different sanctions.[xii]   Thus, states and cities could divest their holdings in companies that do business in Burma or could require companies to disclose whether they do business in Burma as a condition for selling goods or services to the government because these actions do not conflict with the federal Burma law.   Under the Supreme Court ruling, state and local governments also could use preferential purchasing policies regarding countries about which Congress has not passed conflicting legislation.  Thus, the Supreme Court decision, in contrast to WTO Agreement on Government Procurement (AGP) rules, does not rob state and local governments of all their options.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruling is more permissive of human rights links to procurement decisions than the relevant WTO rules.  The WTO AGP forbids consideration of any non-commercial factors in governments’, even sub-federal governments’, procurement decisions.

Therefore, Meru Cosmology, Newtonian Physics, Logical Positivism, Quantum Mechanics, String Theory, etc. can all be considered valid from a Madhyamaka point of view as long as they work and are not subjected to ultimate analysis.

Now then, this does not mean that Madhyamaka precludes cosmologies and scientific theories from being deprecated and replaced with new ones. But Madhyamaka will never hold up any conventional model of the world as being definitive. I think this is the point you are missing.

The same thing happened to the British Midlands.

The most expensive part of manufacturing is the price of human labor. The comparative advantage of labor costs on other countries, compared to the US, is too high for corporations to ignore. At the same time, we are giving corporations massive tax incentives (aka corporate welfare), shifting the burdens of their cost on the taxpayers. Corporate welfare in this country exceeds the social welfare you mention above by hundreds of billions of dollars in tax deferments, write-offs, and so on. And Trump, in his ineffable wisdom, wants to slash corporate tax rates from 35% to 15%. This might help small mom and pop businesses a little (well, until the recession hits us that Trump's policies will inevitably cause), but it will mean billions of dollars in less revenue to run the government and pay for roads, bridges, police, fire departments, schools, and so on.

Your economic nationalism will do nothing but impoverish everyone further, tipping us over into Hunger Games territory in the long run. Your economic nationalism, which will privatize all services, etc., will just in the long run create huge blocks controlled by corporations, rather than governments, as in  like Rollerball.

Islam definitely contributed to the destruction of Buddhism  after Nalanda they continued plundering.
Widespread and almost industrial scale destruction of temples, places of worship. The word ‘butshikan’ gets coined meaning destroyer of Buts (or Buddhas)
Widespread looting  and excessive taxation - Entrenchment of local zamindars, imposition of jizya (tax on non-Muslim subjects). Religion inspired violence, mass forced conversions. They also played a big part in  the slave trade. Also an introduction of Persian as the official language.

I've also seen the whole phrase written "tshogs kyi mchog dge 'dun" which makes more sense if the 'brel sgra is marking apposition rather than connecting an adjective. But most versions I've seen don't include the "dge 'dun".

I think I get it now. It seems ultimately unimportant here whether "mchog" is acting as a noun or an adjective; the meaning is the same and it is syntactically trivial here.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course they are in favor of women with children. Women typically experience a 73% loss in income after a divorce, well men typically experience a 43% boost in income. 40 percent of the households in the US headed by women live in poverty and more than half of impoverished children live with their mothers and not their fathers. For every dollar a man makes, a white women make 77 cents, a black women 63.5 cents, and hispanic woman makes 54 cents.

Thus, I contest your contention that the courts treat men unfairly in divorces. In fact, men, after a divorce, have far more advantages than their former spouses and children as we can see above. Moreover, only 61% of court-orderd child support is ever paid.

These are the facts.

Even though white privilege is a thing, its not all its cracked up to be. Theres draw backs to being a white man...

For example in the eyes of society you have 0 excuse for not being successful and wealthy. Oh youre white? If your not wealthy/have a car/have a home then you are somehow a frak up and someone to avoid. People easily forgive anyone else for not having these things because of their disadvantages, but a white man without these? Worthless. Pathetic. A loser.

If you need help there are not organizations who will really help you. There is no support group. If you are gay you can easily find groups that will take you in, help you, take care of you. If you are a straight white male? Good luck! Same goes with other minorities who have groups focused solely on helping them. As a white man Ive never been able to get help from anyone except immediate friends or family. The government could care less if I fall through the cracks, and there are no real groups that help white men that are easily accessible. You are basically laughed at and ignored if you need help as a white guy.

If you end up homeless as a white man? Well good luck with that! Theres plenty of groups helping women, gays, youths and others but a white man? Again it goes back to this expectation that white = intelligent and competent and if you dont have it all youve done something terribly wrong.

So theres upsides and downsides, but its not all its cracked up to be. My main experience of being white is being held to an impossible standard that in my entire life Ive never been able to live up to.

No different than being a black man or a latino man. Men have zero access to social services apart from food stamps. It is not a white man thing, it is a man thing. Also if you are a women, it is the same, unless you have young kids. Of course, the amount of money spent on social services such as welfare are a tiny percentage of the budget, but no one ever notices this when they bitch about lack of access to social services they imagine "other" people have access to. In other words, your post is basically racist since you imagine you are being held up to a standard that people of color are not being held up to.

When racist language is used, it is appropriate to term it racist.

When such complaints are lodged by such men, it is appropriate to call those complaints sexist. When an advantaged person complains that their advantage is a disadvantage by either ethnicity or gender, that complaint is wither racist or sexist because it involves pointing out something undesirable about another race or a gender.

If Mahamudra/Dzogchen is unconditioned then it would not be associated with positive mental factors either.  Right?

Malcolm wrote:
In order to arrive at the realization of either, one must have first given rise to five faculties (faith, diligence, mindfulness, samadhi and wisdom), the first set within the 37 factors of awakening. These five faculties are found with neutral (mindfulness, samadhi and wisdom) and positive mental factors (faith and diligence), and when combined with the right path, lead to eventual buddhahood.

There is no such thing as an actual nonconceptual experience. A so called nonconceptual experience is one that is attended by a very subtle level of conceptuality, not entirely absent of conceptuality, just as formless means "very subtle matter" but not actually immaterial in fact.

Gyurme Kundrol said:
Even though white privilege is a thing, its not all its cracked up to be. Theres draw backs to being a white man...

For example in the eyes of society you have 0 excuse for not being successful and wealthy. Oh youre white? If your not wealthy/have a car/have a home then you are somehow a frak up and someone to avoid. People easily forgive anyone else for not having these things because of their disadvantages, but a white man without these? Worthless. Pathetic. A loser.

If you need help there are not organizations who will really help you. There is no support group. If you are gay you can easily find groups that will take you in, help you, take care of you. If you are a straight white male? Good luck! Same goes with other minorities who have groups focused solely on helping them. As a white man Ive never been able to get help from anyone except immediate friends or family. The government could care less if I fall through the cracks, and there are no real groups that help white men that are easily accessible. You are basically laughed at and ignored if you need help as a white guy.

If you end up homeless as a white man? Well good luck with that! Theres plenty of groups helping women, gays, youths and others but a white man? Again it goes back to this expectation that white = intelligent and competent and if you dont have it all youve done something terribly wrong.

So theres upsides and downsides, but its not all its cracked up to be. My main experience of being white is being held to an impossible standard that in my entire life Ive never been able to live up to.

No different than being a black man or a latino man. Men have zero access to social services apart from food stamps. It is not a white man thing, it is a man thing.

Of course, the amount of money spent on social services such as welfare are a tiny percentage of the budget, but no one ever notices this when they bitch about lack of access to social services they imagine "other" people have access to. In other words, your post is basically racist since you imagine you are being held up to a standard that people of color are not being held up to.

Are you suggesting that money should be based on something like gold? The gold standard is a terrible idea:

Why would anyone want to go back to the bad old days? The gold standard limited central banks from printing money when economies needed central banks to print money, and limited governments from running deficits when economies needed governments to run deficits. It was a devilish device for turning recessions into depressions. The answer is that some people aren't worried about depressions. Some people are worried about inflation. Even when none exists. To them, these fetters are the feature, not a bug.

Gyurme Kundrol said:
Yes that is what I was suggesting. My understanding is that the economy is basically a bunch of fake money- not really backed by anything anymore. Its just...digits. Those digits have more value in some places on earth than others. They are backed maybe by labor, but thats a very emphemeral thing.

So I guess my question is... what is our money even based on anymore? It used to be based on gold and silver... now its just paper. Or so it seems!

Malcolm wrote:
I think you need to study some economic history. For example, the economic history of money, and the instability which is inevitable when the value of currency is pinned to a precious metal such as gold or silver, for example. So called commodity money is at the mercy of commodity prices, as history shows, when the Spaniards flooded the world markets with silver from Mexico:

Gyurme Kundrol said:
For hundreds of years, China produced silk, porcelain, and tea to acquire a commodity, silver, which was needed to replace the paper notes that the government had made valueless. It was as if to buy a newspaper for a dollar one first had to make and sell something else to get the dollar banknote. Actually, it was worse: the silver stocks had to be constantly replenished, incurring further costs, because the metal was constantly worn away as it passed from hand to hand. (Paper money wears out, too, but costs next to nothing to replace.) Given the circumstances, acquiring the silver was entirely rational— it provided monetary stability. But it was also extremely costly. “Rather than pull silver out of their own ground (had China contained rich silver deposits, which it did not), the Chinese produced exports to buy silver that was pulled out of the ground somewhere else,” Flynn wrote in an e-mail to me. “Even scholars tend to impute mystical qualities to commodity monies like silver and gold, but we must recognize them as physical products that involve massive production costs. A significant hunk of the GDP of China— then the world’s biggest economy— was surrendered in order to secure a white metal that was produced mostly in Spanish America and Japan. Some people made enormous profits from doing this, but think about what else those resources could have been used for.”

Or is it that the signs of accomplishment of the mantra won't arise unless we count them on the cushion and with a proper mala?  Will healing mantras not have any healing effect, or magnetizing mantras not magnetize, if they are not recited in a formally correct session?  Just wondering, since there's a lot of arguing, but I'm not sure what the criteria are for knowing if a mantra has counted or not.

Sure it is. When you condemn a religion you automatically condemn the people who have a faith commitment to that religion.

There are many religions which validate animal sacrifice, Islam among them. There are other religions, such as Christianity, which proclaim that the entire domain of nonhuman nature has been divinely mandated to be under the suzerainty of humans, men in particular. I don't happen to subscribe to those particular beliefs, but I see no reason to condemn the whole of a religion merely because I disagree with some of its parts. All religions recommend  to their adherents love and compassion as the way of life they should follow.

His Holiness, the Dalai Lama states:
“All the world’s religions, with their emphasis on love, compassion, patience, tolerance and forgiveness, can and do promote inner values. But the reality of the world today is that grounding ethics in religion is no longer adequate. This is why I am increasingly convinced that the time has come to find a way of thinking about spirituality and ethics beyond religion altogether.”
This is, in large part, a statement which reinforces my commitment to the promulgation of humanist ethics as the bedrock upon which people of different faith commitments can find common ground.

I was thinking about this issue and I remembered this: Lama Pema Dorje Rinpoche will be guiding a multi-year program for people over fifty based on intensive practice of the Vajra Guru mantra. This program is suitable for people who have faith in Guru Rinpoche Padmasambhava and would like to recite his mantras ten million times over a three year period. For most people this would amount to a commitment of two or more hours a day of practice, which could be done during formal practice, or when walking, driving, sitting on public transit or similar activity. For those who have not completed the foundational practices—the ngondro—this would be an alternative gateway to becoming a Dzogchen student of Rinpoche’s.

Malcolm wrote:
This is the basic problem in Buddhist intellectual history: to whit, when Nāgārjuna was writing, there was general hostility in Buddhist circles to what we now call "logic," (Pramāṇa), as it evidenced in Nāgārjuna's Vigrahavyāvartanī, as well as some controversy over the notion of what exactly an intrinsic characteristic (svalakṣana) is. For pre-Pramāṇa Buddhism, the idea of svalakṣana was identical to the idea of svabhāva, to give you an example, heat is both the svabhāva as well as the svalakṣana of fire. Many Śrāvaka Buddhists regarded svalakṣanas as ultimate truths.

Enter the Prāmāṇikas such as Dignaga and Dharmakīrti. They used the term "svalakṣana" in a way distinct from the usage that was attacked by Nāgārjuna. They used the term merely to describe the identifying characteristics of a given object such as the blueness of a blue vase, without imposing upon this svalakṣana the idea it was somehow an ultimate truth or entity. Instead, for the Prāmāṇikas, a svalakṣana is merely the simplest percept we can perceive, one that we perceive without concepts.

Bhavaviveka was a post-Pramāṇa author, and by his time, the conventions of Pramāṇa has become so widespread in scholarly Buddhist discourse, that he took Buddhapalita to task in one spot in his MMK commentary for ignoring those conventions (this is Bhavaviveka's real fault). In reply to this, Candrakīrti, also conversant in the conventions of Pramāṇa, decided that Bhavaviveka was being quite unfair, and defended Buddhapalita's original formulation. But this dispute between the two of them should not cause us to ignore Bhavaviveka's enduring and important contributions to the Madhyamaka tradition, and sadly, today it is the case that his contribution has been marginalized precisely because of an overall Tibetan lack of attention to the intellectual history of Indian Buddhism.

And as we know, this reading is hotly contested.

Jeff H said:
Tsong-kha-pa argues that Bhavaviveka’s insistence on autonomous syllogisms is not just a difference in method but also evidences an underlying difference — a shortcoming — in his view of emptiness. The discussion of these points in the Great Treatise is famous as the most difficult portion of the text. Here, I simply offer a summary explanation of Tsong-kha-pa’s conclusions.

In order to understand emptiness, you do not necessarily have to understand or agree with Tsong-kha-pa’s argument about how Bhavaviveka betrays his belief in intrinsic nature. Nor do you have to be absolutely sure that Bhavaviveka really held the position Tsong-kha-pa claims to have discovered implicit in his arguments. Our purpose is to understand emptiness; it is not to debate the details of Buddhist intellectual history. For us, this controversy over how to reason about reality is an opportunity to become more familiar with Tsong-kha-pa’s view of emptiness itself.

Malcolm wrote:
In fact, if you create a Madhyamaka strawman to knock down (or Yogacara strawmen for that matter), you will never come close to understanding the real differences between various Mādhyamaka authors, just as if you insist on abiding by strawmen Buddhists built for refuting in Hindu tenets, you will never come close to understanding what is actually a valid object of rebuttal within Hindu tenet systems. We resist stereotypes and inaccurate characterizations of social and racial groups, why should we be lazy in applying rigor to our investigation of our own and others' tenet systems?

Chill out Jeff. I asked the question well aware of the answer specifically to spark the response of buddhafollower.  I think these are important discussions.

Jeff H said:
Chilling...

In my febrile mind (with thanks and a hat-tip to Malcolm for my new vocabulary word ) and because of the Prasangika distinction, I think of intrinsic as referring to defining qualities that exist within an object and inherent existence as referring to a fully independent object.

The difference is this:
From a Svatantrika perspective, an observing mind discovers an object’s intrinsic qualities and then imputes the correct label on the basis of those pre-existing qualities.

From a Prasangika perspective, however, the very presence of any intrinsic quality would necessarily imply independent, concrete existence, and that is impossible. Therefore, Prasangikas say that the observing mind imputes an object’s apparently intrinsic qualities, thus falsely imbuing it with inherent existence.

The important point is that inherent existence is an object of negation for both Svatantrika and Prasangika. Tsongkhapa postulated the distinction between inherent and intrinsic existence and strongly emphasized the necessity of identifying the object of negation in distinction from “mere existence”, which he identifies as our actual experience of being.

Malcolm wrote:
But this is not the actual difference between Bhava and Buddhapalita, which hinges solely on a pedagogical distinction based on the former's criticism of the latter for not using a formal syllogism to refute the Saṃkhya position of arising from self in the latter's prolegomena in his commentary on the MMK.

First off the book I'm reading "Emptiness: The Foundation of Buddhist Thought, Volume 5" uses the words Inherent Existence and Intrinsic Existence. I do not know what these 2 things mean.. What is Inherent existence? What is Intrinsic existence? I have looked them both up on online dictionariesd but i still dont know what they really mean. I know the Intrinsic means Belonging Naturally and the Inherent means existing in something as a permanent, essential, or characteristic attribute. But what you put these together with existence and speak that this is reality I'm at a loss. I know I shouldnt be but I am. The book says that Intrinsic and Inherent existence is empty. But I dont understand that.

I was looking at my lamp and then my computer and I said to myself that I value the computer Intrinsicly but I do not value the lamp intrisicly. Then I compared the 2.. But I found that I'm really just looking at value and not intrinsic. I saw how my value is an Illusory exeprience but How do I Intriniscly see it? Is it Inrinsicly real? I'm at a loss with this.

The idea that inherent existence is the sole object of negation is a key feature of Tsongkhapa's thinking. This is his interpretation of a key feature of Candrakīriti's thinking, i.e., that the negation of inherent existence was common to both Mahāyāna and Śrāvaka tenet systems. What Tsongkhapa neglected was that the uncommon Mahāyāna formulation of emptiness however is the systematic negation of the four extremes. This is not found in Śrāvaka tenet systems at all. As a consequence, the followers of Tsongkhapa deride the profound Mahāyāna emptiness of freedom extremes as promulgated in Tibet by Batshab Nyima Drag (the translator of Candrakīrti's major works into Tibetan).

The above of course is why laws favoring poor whites were instituted in the 18th century in order to turn them against their African compatriots which whom they had previously found common cause with and with whom they often revolted together to protest the conditions of oppression they both found themselves in:

maybay said:
Fearful that such measures might not be sufficient to protect their interests, the planter class took an additional precautionary step, a step that would later come to be known as a “racial bribe.” Deliberately and strategically, the planter class extended special privileges to poor whites in an effort to drive a wedge between them and black slaves. White settlers were allowed greater access to Native American lands, white servants were allowed to police slaves through slave patrols and militias, and barriers were created so that free labor would not be placed in competition with slave labor. These measures effectively eliminated the risk of future alliances between black slaves and poor whites. Poor whites suddenly had a direct, personal stake in the existence of a race-based system of slavery. Their own plight had not improved by much, but at least they were not slaves. Once the planter elite split the labor force, poor whites responded to the logic of their situation and sought ways to expand their racially privileged position.

They repeatedly raised the issue of welfare, subtly framing it as a contest between hardworking, blue-collar whites and poor blacks who refused to work. The not-so-subtle message to working-class whites was that their tax dollars were going to support special programs for blacks who most certainly did not deserve them.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes. Definitely. Why? Because if they do not practice in a proper way, there will be no benefit whatsoever in their practice.

As for why one does not practice in the presence of those who do not have samaya or who have impure samya:

The Samayasarvaviti-anusarvasani-tantra vimalaraja-nama states:
Associating with a samaya breaker, or appeasing a samaya breaker,
explaining the Dharma to samaya breakers and unsuitable vessels, 
and not shunning samaya breakers will cause one to be affected
with the contamination of the broken samaya of those samaya breakers.
I confess and reveal with shame and repentance
the negative conditions of this life and the obscurations of the next.

Patrul Rinpoche states:
In particular, the Dharmas of Secret Mantra Vajrayāna say “Reciting the visualizations of the creations is a doorway of words.” Those critical points of the creation stage are just words of a visualization. Without even facing the meaning of the creation and completion stage which is the reason for the visualizations, they summon with many kinds of ritual words which are empty talk such as visualize this, meditate that, focus on this, chanting to drums and horns. When they come to the actual approach recitation, the essential meaning, [225/b] they relax. In the end, their posture which has been straight up to now is released. They smoke tobacco, the source of one hundred nonvirtues. They open the treasure of much gossip with irrelevant talk of news in the valleys. They pass the time by counting a thousand malas, like pulling intestines. When the evening comes, they look once at the sky, saying “Vajra puṣpe, dhupe…” and release a crescendo of cymbals. Since their ersatz rituals are worse than imitation rites, it is definitely better  than that to recite the confession of downfalls or the Bhadracaryapranhidhana with pure motivation.

Nobody is denying that. --but the idea that the weaver, or the pimp, or the sesame seed pounder, didn't do formal sessions, but engaged in the Two Stages in the midst of their work is not supported.
Neither is the idea that they DIDN'T engage in the Two Stages in the midst of their work.  There is not really enough evidence to support either view. And they kept their practice secret.
I don't think anybody here said that you should run around telling everybody your Yidam and the practice associated with it. But it doesn't mean that Vinapa used his lute playing as his method of obtaining realization.
In some of the stories they quite clearly use their daily life as a support for their practice.


Malcolm wrote:
These people were sent out to engage in these occupations once they had reached the stage of strong heat on the Mantra path of application. When one reaches the stage of strong heat, there are three things one should know: first, at this point the kind of vratyācarya ( brtul shugs spyod pa ) one before engaged in secretly should now be done in public. Secondly, at this point one cannot break one's samaya. Third, as a sign of one's practice, one's bell and vajra will float in space while one is practicing.

Prior to this, however, they did their practice in strict secrecy.

It's a really fascinating thing. You practice a tantra that supposedly brings you to a level or realization beyond good and evil, holy and unholy, pure and impure, etc. However, it's extremely important that your mala actually is of the exact right substance, blessed by a master, nobody is allowed to see or touch it and so on. Otherwise, unfortunately, there is absolutely no way of success.

Reading the stories of the mahasiddhas, it's quite obvious that they used whatever circumstances were given to either teach or learn. If you could obtain a perfect mala and practice under the perfect circumstances, great. If not, still ok.

One has to work with their circumstances.  Obviously if one can execute a practice "by-the-book" then one should.  But the internal mechanisms of the practice, seem to me, to be more important than the external forms.

As far as I am concerned it would be stupid to say to somebody that they cannot achieve liberation if they practice in the presence of people not bound by samaya, if they only have the opportunity to practice in the presence of those without samaya.  It would also fail to take into account that Dzogchen/Mahamudra is with us everywhere, and under all circumstances.  Dzogchen/Mahamudra is not restricted to those holding malas in the left hand, while hiding them from those that are not bound by samaya, and only within the physical confines of a sanctified space.  Dzogchen/Mahamudra is boundless, completely unrestricted by space and time.  So, it sees to me, that to say that it can only be realized under specific physical conditions is a recipe for failure.

Malcolm wrote:
You are making a classic error. There are many kinds of Dzogchen practice that must be done in complete secrecy. Secret Mantra is called "secret" for a reason.

What are some ways of counting mantra which will not attract unnecessary attention, besides rosary and tally counters ?

Any technique or method to count mantra anytime, anywhere easily without attracting unnecessary attention

With rosary and tally counters,  it attracts too much attention

There is one way of counting on fingers but its complicated and cant be used as easily and readily  as tally counters

Frankly, all three are "true compassion," but the third is the Buddha's compassion.  Those on the path can experience the first two.

Malcolm wrote:
In the other hand, Mr. Trump precisely matches Umberto Eco's fourteen points that make one a fascist:

Coëmgenu said:
1. The first feature of Ur-Fascism is the cult of tradition. Traditionalism is of course much older than fascism. Not only was it typical of counter-revolutionary Catholic thought after the French revolution, but it was born in the late Hellenistic era, as a reaction to classical Greek rationalism. In the Mediterranean basin, people of different religions (most of them indulgently accepted by the Roman Pantheon) started dreaming of a revelation received at the dawn of human history. This revelation, according to the traditionalist mystique, had remained for a long time concealed under the veil of forgotten languages—in Egyptian hieroglyphs, in the Celtic runes, in the scrolls of the little known religions of Asia.

This new culture had to be syncretistic. Syncretism is not only, as the dictionary says, “the combination of different forms of belief or practice”; such a combination must tolerate contradictions. Each of the original messages contains a silver of wisdom, and whenever they seem to say different or incompatible things it is only because all are alluding, allegorically, to the same primeval truth.

As a consequence, there can be no advancement of learning. Truth has been already spelled out once and for all, and we can only keep interpreting its obscure message.

One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements. The most influential theoretical source of the theories of the new Italian right, Julius Evola, merged the Holy Grail with The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, alchemy with the Holy Roman and Germanic Empire. The very fact that the Italian right, in order to show its open-mindedness, recently broadened its syllabus to include works by De Maistre, Guenon, and Gramsci, is a blatant proof of syncretism.

If you browse in the shelves that, in American bookstores, are labeled as New Age, you can find there even Saint Augustine who, as far as I know, was not a fascist. But combining Saint Augustine and Stonehenge—that is a symptom of Ur-Fascism.

2. Traditionalism implies the rejection of modernism. Both Fascists and Nazis worshiped technology, while traditionalist thinkers usually reject it as a negation of traditional spiritual values. However, even though Nazism was proud of its industrial achievements, its praise of modernism was only the surface of an ideology based upon Blood and Earth (Blut und Boden). The rejection of the modern world was disguised as a rebuttal of the capitalistic way of life, but it mainly concerned the rejection of the Spirit of 1789 (and of 1776, of course). The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.

3. Irrationalism also depends on the cult of action for action’s sake. Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation. Therefore culture is suspect insofar as it is identified with critical attitudes. Distrust of the intellectual world has always been a symptom of Ur-Fascism, from Goering’s alleged statement (“When I hear talk of culture I reach for my gun”) to the frequent use of such expressions as “degenerate intellectuals,” “eggheads,” “effete snobs,” “universities are a nest of reds.” The official Fascist intellectuals were mainly engaged in attacking modern culture and the liberal intelligentsia for having betrayed traditional values.

4. No syncretistic faith can withstand analytical criticism. The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge. For Ur-Fascism, disagreement is treason.

5. Besides, disagreement is a sign of diversity. Ur-Fascism grows up and seeks for consensus by exploiting and exacerbating the natural fear of difference. The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.
6. Ur-Fascism derives from individual or social frustration. That is why one of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups. In our time, when the old “proletarians” are becoming petty bourgeois (and the lumpen are largely excluded from the political scene), the fascism of tomorrow will find its audience in this new majority.

7. To people who feel deprived of a clear social identity, Ur-Fascism says that their only privilege is the most common one, to be born in the same country. This is the origin of nationalism. Besides, the only ones who can provide an identity to the nation are its enemies. Thus at the root of the Ur-Fascist psychology there is the obsession with a plot, possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia. But the plot must also come from the inside: Jews are usually the best target because they have the advantage of being at the same time inside and outside. In the US, a prominent instance of the plot obsession is to be found in Pat Robertson’s The New World Order, but, as we have recently seen, there are many others.

8. The followers must feel humiliated by the ostentatious wealth and force of their enemies. When I was a boy I was taught to think of Englishmen as the five-meal people. They ate more frequently than the poor but sober Italians. Jews are rich and help each other through a secret web of mutual assistance. However, the followers must be convinced that they can overwhelm the enemies. Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak. Fascist governments are condemned to lose wars because they are constitutionally incapable of objectively evaluating the force of the enemy.

9. For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle. Thus pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. It is bad because life is permanent warfare. This, however, brings about an Armageddon complex. Since enemies have to be defeated, there must be a final battle, after which the movement will have control of the world. But such a “final solution” implies a further era of peace, a Golden Age, which contradicts the principle of permanent war. No fascist leader has ever succeeded in solving this predicament.

10. Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology, insofar as it is fundamentally aristocratic, and aristocratic and militaristic elitism cruelly implies contempt for the weak. Ur-Fascism can only advocate a popular elitism. Every citizen belongs to the best people of the world, the members of the party are the best among the citizens, every citizen can (or ought to) become a member of the party. But there cannot be patricians without plebeians. In fact, the Leader, knowing that his power was not delegated to him democratically but was conquered by force, also knows that his force is based upon the weakness of the masses; they are so weak as to need and deserve a ruler. Since the group is hierarchically organized (according to a military model), every subordinate leader despises his own underlings, and each of them despises his inferiors. This reinforces the sense of mass elitism.

11. In such a perspective everybody is educated to become a hero. In every mythology the hero is an exceptional being, but in Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death. It is not by chance that a motto of the Falangists was Viva la Muerte (in English it should be translated as “Long Live Death!”). In non-fascist societies, the lay public is told that death is unpleasant but must be faced with dignity; believers are told that it is the painful way to reach a supernatural happiness. By contrast, the Ur-Fascist hero craves heroic death, advertised as the best reward for a heroic life. The Ur-Fascist hero is impatient to die. In his impatience, he more frequently sends other people to death.

12. Since both permanent war and heroism are difficult games to play, the Ur-Fascist transfers his will to power to sexual matters. This is the origin of machismo (which implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality). Since even sex is a difficult game to play, the Ur-Fascist hero tends to play with weapons—doing so becomes an ersatz phallic exercise.

13. Ur-Fascism is based upon a selective populism, a qualitative populism, one might say. In a democracy, the citizens have individual rights, but the citizens in their entirety have a political impact only from a quantitative point of view—one follows the decisions of the majority. For Ur-Fascism, however, individuals as individuals have no rights, and the People is conceived as a quality, a monolithic entity expressing the Common Will. Since no large quantity of human beings can have a common will, the Leader pretends to be their interpreter. Having lost their power of delegation, citizens do not act; they are only called on to play the role of the People. Thus the People is only a theatrical fiction. To have a good instance of qualitative populism we no longer need the Piazza Venezia in Rome or the Nuremberg Stadium. There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.

Because of its qualitative populism Ur-Fascism must be against “rotten” parliamentary governments. One of the first sentences uttered by Mussolini in the Italian parliament was “I could have transformed this deaf and gloomy place into a bivouac for my maniples”—“maniples” being a subdivision of the traditional Roman legion. As a matter of fact, he immediately found better housing for his maniples, but a little later he liquidated the parliament. Wherever a politician casts doubt on the legitimacy of a parliament because it no longer represents the Voice of the People, we can smell Ur-Fascism.

14. Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. Newspeak was invented by Orwell, in 1984, as the official language of Ingsoc, English Socialism. But elements of Ur-Fascism are common to different forms of dictatorship. All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning. But we must be ready to identify other kinds of Newspeak, even if they take the apparently innocent form of a popular talk show.

Malcolm wrote:
Thugs rje, compassion, is the basis for the arising of the nirmanakāya. For example, the commentary on the Realms and Transformation of Sound Tantra states:
Thugs is the affection (brtse ba) in the heart for sentient beings. Rje is
the arising of a special empathy (gdung sems) for them.
And:
When analyzed, there is the compassion that exists in the basis, the compassion that appears on the path, and the compassion of the perfected result.

Among those, since the compassion that exists on the path is undivided, it exists as the basis for the arising of the diversity. Since it is undisclosed, it has no activities.

There is the compassion that appears on the path. From among the three pristine consciousnesses of the basis, since the essence is intrinsically pure, [compassion] is not disclosed in any way. Since the nature self-appears, compassionate deeds are diverse. Since all beings are pervaded by compassion, compassion seems to appear as the one who tames those to be tamed.

The compassion of the perfected result intrinsically exists in the dharmakāya, comes from invocation and supplication to the sambhogakāya, and is produced when the nirmāṇakāya meets conditions and objects.

More specifically, is it plausible that Bon and Shinto only began to define themselves as "a religion" after encountering "a religion" in the form of (imported) Buddhism? That practitioners only developed a systematic philosophical framework after encountering (and no doubt debating) Buddhism?

Johnny Dangerous said:
WIth Bon, from a perspective of historicity, there i some truth to this I think. AFAIK The Bonpo developed their own system of dialectics etc. in response to Buddhism. However, I -do- think that a part of their teaching is undeniably ancient, the part that is and the part that is not is a subject for debate..and that debate is more important to historians than to practitioners, I think.

I think if you're going to ask about the influence, you at least to consider that there is some kernel of truth to the Bonpo claim that their tradition is old, and has influenced Tibetan Buddhism, the first is harder to prove with modern methods, but the second is undeniable. There are all kinds of aspects of Vajrayana that come from Bon..and vice versa, but practitioners on both sides seem to find it a thorny area.

Anyway, the main point is that Bon is as "complete" as Vajrayana, just viewing it as "shamanism" hasn't been true for near1000 years, by the most conservative estimate, and it's influence on TB extends beyond Shamanism too.

They might have had their games down, believed deeply in their stories ... but I never met anyone I would trust to tell me how to "get it." With the possible exception of Anam Thubten, but I'll never know how that would have worked out because he doesn't offer the kind of personal relationship with regular private meetings that I want in a teacher.

Speech without agency is impotent, and is therefore neither right nor wrong. Like any other action, when I speak I have created something in the world that was not there before.

Malcolm wrote:
The listener has a moral obligation to himself to evaluate all that he or she hears and judge whether it is valid or not. No one can make those determinations for anyone but themselves. A person can certainly hand over their agency by willingly choosing to believe everything a given person says, but they are never stripped of their moral autonomy with respect to making decisions about things that are right and wrong. Thus, if someone hears from Donald Trump that most Mexicans are rapists and drug dealers, and then proceeds to go out and beat and harass Mexicans, getting arrested for it, Donald Trump is not responsible for their actions to the extent that he cannot be found liable for incitement. Of course, if it is found that he is guilty of incitement, this in no way mitigates all those people who were incited to act criminally. Those people turned over their agency to another, but this does not remove their autonomous moral authority, unless they are children.

If speech has meaning, it has a moral power to affect circumstances just like any other object of perception, and those who use it are responsible for it.

If I refuse to have a conversation with some "deplorable", can I really blame that person if they take some action which I might not appreciate?

If I see someone with a knife in his hand and refuse to tell him how to remove it, can I really blame that person if they do something in some passion which harms them and others even more?

Malcolm wrote:
We are talking at cross purposes.

One is one's own authority. One cannot rely on another for authority. Eichman sought to excuse his actions by claiming his responsibility was deferred because he was following orders. The point is that he was passing the buck.

People following Trump are responsible for their own decision. I am not responsible for their decision. It is no failing of mine personally that Trump was elected. I did not vote for him.

People are autonomous authorities. They can choose to relinquish that authority, but that choice also autonomous. A person's agency can be stripped away from them, but never their authority.

You are confusing agency with authority. As an agent in the world, I have responsibility for actions of mine that harm others. But agency and authority are different. When we make moral arguments, we can only do so by respecting the fact that people are morally autonomous. For example, if we have a conversation with someone who voted for Trump, we have to respect their moral autonomy in making that decision. We have to respect Eichmann's moral autonomy too. Indeed, the whole premise upon which convicting him of genocide, etc., rests, is that he was morally autonomous and made criminal choices which arose from his autonomy. He was not a minor, for example, whose moral autonomy is limited and therefore, his crimes might be ascribed to his parents, or in Eichmanns case, his superiors. The recognition of the moral autonomy of the individual is the basis for all distinctions of right and wrong in an individual's conduct.

With respect to your knife example: you have no agency to interfere with that person unless the knife they are holding is illegal, or they appear to be actively harming someone. People have the moral autonomy to make bad choices.

Interview with Nell Irvin Painter, author of The History of White People:

Unknown said:
As you write in the book, there were four great expansions of what America considers whiteness. What were they?

The first three are expansions of whiteness, because the assumption was that to be American you first had to be white. The first occurred in the Jacksonian era, in the first half of the 19th century, when citizenship criteria were changed from wealth to race. That’s when adult males of any income were allowed to vote, as long as they were considered white. Things changed in the 20th century, when different groups came in as immigrants and people of Irish background were incorporated into the notion of American whiteness. The third great enlargement took place in the mid-20th century, starting with the New Deal in the 1930s and WWII. Politics and the mobilization of Americans to fight the Great Depression and to fight the Second World War opened up American-ness to people who had been considered alien races and their children and grandchildren.

We’re currently in the midst of the fourth great expansion, which is an expansion of the idea of the American — that an American doesn’t necessarily need to be white to be considered American. “American” now includes Hispanics, for example, and people who identify themselves as multiracial. Because of this sort of great enlargement, we can no longer sum up the American as one person or the white man as one person.

Many interesting statistics happening recently such as as huge surge in memberships in the ACLU and the Souther Poverty Law Center, plus the actions of countless protesters nationwide.

Things are just really getting started.

And as I think Malcolm rightly points out, progressive change will take a while since racism is baked-in to the justice system and many other parts of the federal and state governments. Meanwhile, people who engage in racist behavior should be held accountable in every peaceful way possible. This begins with speaking truth to power as plainly and loudly as can be done.

Political discontent is almost always divorced from economic reality.

There was no recovery from 2008. Quantitative easing has delayed any real recovery. ZIRP has been bleeding people on fixed income dry. The only jobs that have been created are at the low end of the market, everything else has been either hollowed out, shipped out or filled by foreigners on H1Bs. This is exactly why Trump's message resonated with enough people to win.

Economic "reality" is totally divorced from actual reality. Witness how a bad jobs report or CPI read leads to the stock market climbing on anticipation of further easing. Conversely a good jobs report bleeds points off the stock market as investors fear the QE party will end and/or interest rates will climb. The incentives are entirely perverse and not at all what Keynes intended to stimulate the economy during a bust.

If Obama had actually locked up the Blankfein's and Geitner's and Summers of the world for their role in the crash, the Democrats might have some credibility. The fact of the matter is, right now they are the Vampire Squid Party. You can't run an economy on financial "engineering". You need to actually make stuff. There will be a day of reckoning for us either way. The pendulum has swung far too far towards globalism. It's time for it to swing back, and yes it won't be fun for a lot of people, particularly with the fascists controlling all three branches of government.

Karma Dorje said:
Nonetheless, the majority of Americans are part of the global high-income population that resides almost exclusively in Europe and North America. These two regions accounted for 87% of the global high-income population in 2011 – only slightly less than in 2001, when their share stood at 91%.

However, larger economic problems loomed in the guise of weak banks. When the Creditanstalt of Austria failed in 1931, the global deficiencies of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff became apparent.[17]

U.S. imports decreased 66% from $4.4 billion (1929) to $1.5 billion (1933), and exports decreased 61% from $5.4 billion to $2.1 billion. GNP fell from $103.1 billion in 1929 to $75.8 billion in 1931 and bottomed out at $55.6 billion in 1933.[21] Imports from Europe decreased from a 1929 high of $1.3 billion to just $390 million during 1932, while U.S. exports to Europe decreased from $2.3 billion in 1929 to $784 million in 1932.

I think most modern U$ citizens are already "good Germans" and have been for quite some time, especially when they turned a blind-eye to the excesses of the U$ military in Asia, the Middle East and to their governments support of murderous dictatorships in Central and South America.

And let us not forget the treatment of their own citizens in U$ jail facilities.

I reckon (if one was not to take into account the methodical genocide of Native Americans, which is why I am referring to MODERN U$ citizens), that U$ citizens have been "good Germans" since the mass murder of 230,000 civilians in Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

Malcolm wrote:
I can understand why you see it that way. I think it is bit more complicated than that, however.

During the Cold War, most Americans thought that our governments actions were totally justified in the face of the spread of communism. It was not the case that Americans sought to deflect blame, they actually supported our actions overseas and abroad (including the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki).

Now, most Americans, once they woke up from the fog of 9/11, realize that the Iraq War was deeply wrong, even those who voted for Trump. Many Americans understand that the destruction of Libya was wrong. And Syria is not on us, that's on Assad and Putin, despite our blunders with respect to the the Syrian opposition. The Iraqis would not give US troops immunity, so we pulled them all out in 2011, hence ISIS.

In their pursuit of unfettered global trade, which they imagined was going to create a consumer paradise (instead it created a Walmart Nation of cheap shit that breaks easily and unhealthy food), the Democrats ceded the civil rights movement (we should include the LGBT movement here), the labor movement, the women's movement, and the environmental movement. To whom? To no one. They just dropped it.

Meanwhile, the religious right got their shit together. They 1) created a movement to oppose a woman's right to reproductive health, 2) manufactured the myth that America was post-racial and that civil rights for all people were in fact guaranteed (it isn't and they are not), 3) manufactured the myth that climate change is debatable science (it isn't), and 4) seeing an opportunity with Trump to hijack areas where in the United States the labor movement used to be powerful, they won this time.

You need real movements in order to generate electoral results. The neoliberal solution of making sure everyone has cellphones and flatscreen tvs is not working. Ergo, we need to revive the civil rights movement, the women's movement, the labor movement, and most importantly of all, the environmental movement.

another?' then he makes the decision: 'Whether this is one or the other, I shall kill him': by reason

reason of these three factors, there is the action (above, note 312). If this is the case,then a person
can be in doubt and kill (=commit the transgression of murder): 'Is this a living being or not? Is this
such a one or not?' This person, with respect to the object to be killed, is determined to kill:
'Whether this be one or the other, I shall kill him.' There is thus production of a parityaga thought.
If he kills, he obtains the transgression of killing."

In Tibet, it spread in small circles again, since everything but Nyingma was small at that point. By 1200, Indian Buddhist was more or less finished and there was never a chance in India for the Kalacakra social vision to spread far, if at all, because people were mainly interested in its yogic novelties, and astrology system.

I know is tempting to pin all the blame on CNN, MSNBC, the Times and so on. But the reality of it is that POC and young people did not turn out because they just didn't care. "An old white guy? An old white women? Meh. Who cares."

The story is, according to turn out, a not surge from a forgotten America — there was a depressed turnout in this election compared with  2008 and 2012, which showed a precipitous decline in Democratic voters between 2008 and 2016.

2008: 69.5 million for Obama; 60 million for MacCain
2012: 66 million for Obama; 61 million for Romney
2016 59.8 million votes for Clinton, 59.6 million votes for Trump.

Trump lost, but given how the electoral college works, he won. In a nutshell, Clinton failed to energize voters in the right places. (The gutting of the Voting Rights Act sure did not help her either).

The thing is, at least Clinton accepts that anthropogenic climate change is a problem we have to face up. Now, we have to deal with thin-skinned narcissist who wants to role back Roe V Wade; change the first Amendment; frack on federal lands; impose trade tariffs, etc.

Essentially, he wants to (without understanding any of the history) dismantle the Federal Government and put us back on the so-called American System of the Whigs:
*Support for a high tariff to protect American industries and generate revenue for the federal government
*Maintenance of high public land prices to generate federal revenue
*Preservation of the Bank of the United States to stabilize the currency and rein in risky state and local banks
*Development of a system of internal improvements (such as roads and canals) which would knit the nation together and be financed by the tariff and land sales revenues.
In simpler terms, he wishes to implement Neomercantilism.

Thanks for the encouraging words, Malcolm, but the election is over in any case.  I was thinking more of the election's horrific consequences.  Guru Rinpoche was even said to have stopped wars, but I suppose he is really only a "method" rather than a great being, as I hear from wiser people than I, and thus unable to influence worldly events.

Next, an Amendment to prevent all of a state's electoral votes from going to the same candidate because of majority. Basically, outlawing first past the post. This would destroy the two party hold on the Presidency, and allow the people to choose actual best options when voting.

Finally, a term limit Amendment for Congress, and a number of years limit on SCOTUS Justices. This removes people from lifetime membership to federal ruling class, and prevents the nation from moving too far in one direction because of entrenched politicians.

Finally, amendment to eliminate non-elected regulatory bodies. All laws need to run through Congress, who, by this point should actually represent the people in the manner designed.

You obviously deny the existence of the Illusory Body of Highest Yoga Tantra which possesses limbs and appears in the aspect of the Deity. Looks like Father Tantra is a waste of time then according to you!

Malcolm wrote:
The Diamond Sūtra states, famously:
Anyone who sees me as form, 
anyone who knows me as sound,
engage in mistaken effort.
Those people who do not see me,
see the dharmatā of the buddhas. 
Since the dharmakāya of the guides
is not a knowable entity,
it cannot be known.
The creation stage is not necessary as many Indian scholars such as Śri Simha and so on have argued. In the Śrīsarvaguhyavidhigarbhālaṃkāra-nāma, Mañjuśrīkīrti records their position:
The teaching of the creation stage and its means of conduct are taught as methods for refuting annihilationists, for proponents of the dependently originated result, and for some worldly people who are terrified of the profound meaning. Utterly pure, perfect buddhahood itself is an inconceivable pristine consciousness. Since that cannot arise from a dissimilar cause, here, emptiness —which is not perceptible as a sign, inconceivable, and the eliminator proliferation— is the supreme result that possessed when the yogi relies on the absence of thoughts.
Of course he complains that these Dzogchen practitioners have an invalid point of view, but this is because he does not understand the meaning of "absence of thoughts," in this case, the absence of thoughts referred refers to the nonconceptual direct perception of dharmatā. The latter does not require the creation stage since dharmatā is innate.

Tsongkhapafan said:
Thanks for your response. Of course the principal basis of imputation for a Buddha is the truth body, but Buddhas manifest as subtle and gross form to help sentient beings. The path body that is the principal cause of these is the Illusory body developed through completion stage meditation.

Your objection is already noted in here: "The teaching of the creation stage and its means of conduct are taught as methods for refuting annihilationists, for proponents of the dependently originated result, and for some worldly people who are terrified of the profound meaning."

I completely disagree that generation stage is not necessary and this is in contradiction with the views of the great Indian adepts such as Saraha and Nagarjuna. They are clear that generation stage is the cause of completion stage and completion stage is where we manifest and purify our very subtle mind and turn it into the pristine consciousness of a Buddha.

Dehumanizing views are pervasive across white social groups.

That said, there is one group of whites that stands out in the degree to which it holds dehumanizing views of black people: Trump supporters. To measure evaluations of Trump, we asked our subjects to describe how warm they feel toward Trump on a 0-100 scale. Here we compare Trump’s strongest opponents (defined here as those who rate Trump at a 25 or below) to Trump’s strongest supporters (those who rate Trump higher than 75).

That policy is, I agree, flawed, but nothing she did either in the Senate nor State is inconsistent with the general tenor of US foreign policy. Pragmatically speaking, dismantling the Pax Americana means permitting power vacuums to be occupied by China and Russia , and ensuring decades of unrest around the world. As far as the money from the Saudis go, the US Government has been accepting money from the Saudis for decades: for example, the Saudis transerred 100 Billion dollars to the US in the '70's and '80's for administration, construction, weapons. The pittance that the Clinton Foundation received is hardly grounds for alarm considering how much money the Saudis have invested in the US for the past 40 years.

The myth of perpetual war is saddening, because it is false. The war on drugs, now that has been a real perpetual war, and has gained no ground. It was lost before it began. The war on terror is similar, but these are not real wars. Right now we are in one of the most peaceful eras in world history. But people are made hysterical by the media, and when they are hysterical they tend to vote for fascists like Trump, fantasists like Stein, and irresponsible, ignorant stoners like Gary "Aleppo" Johnson (whose libertarian platform is an environmental nightmare). At least Clinton and Sanders are sane, unlike the other three candidates in the race.

If you are a real Sanders supporter, you are heading out to the polls to vote the way Bernie votes.

Don't expect her to excel at retail level politics, showing up to cut ribbons at newly opened youth centers the way Schumer does.

We see her decision making is uninspired and sometimes poor because she seems she stays safely within the parameters of "Conventional Wisdom". She has conservative instincts. She will not take a position unless its clear that the support is already there. She is not a leader in the sense that she leads. She is a leader in the sense that she can get things done in bureaucratic/administrative environments.

Yes, she is not going to shake up the status quo, and as I explained to dreambow, we do not want the status quo shaken, since it will result in social, economic, and environmental calamity. we actually wish the Liberal status quo to continue. When the GOP and the far left complain about the status quo, they are complaining about the Liberal status quo. Anyone who is not a) a social conservative b) a bat shit crazy anarchist from the right or the left wants this liberal status quo. This liberal status quo is necessary so we have the social and economic stability needed to further transform our healthcare system, our educational system, and to address the climate crisis effectively.

The Diamond Sūtra states, famously:
Anyone who sees me as form, 
anyone who knows me as sound,
engage in mistaken effort.
Those people who do not see me,
see the dharmatā of the buddhas. 
Since the dharmakāya of the guides
is not a knowable entity,
it cannot be known.
The creation stage is not necessary as many Indian scholars such as Śri Simha and so on have argued. In the Śrīsarvaguhyavidhigarbhālaṃkāra-nāma, Mañjuśrīkīrti records their position:
The teaching of the creation stage and its means of conduct are taught as methods for refuting annihilationists, for proponents of the dependently originated result, and for some worldly people who are terrified of the profound meaning. Utterly pure, perfect buddhahood itself is an inconceivable pristine consciousness. Since that cannot arise from a dissimilar cause, here, emptiness —which is not perceptible as a sign, inconceivable, and the eliminator proliferation— is the supreme result that possessed when the yogi relies on the absence of thoughts.
Of course he complains that these Dzogchen practitioners have an invalid point of view, but this is because he does not understand the meaning of "absence of thoughts," in this case, the absence of thoughts referred refers to the nonconceptual direct perception of dharmatā. The latter does not require the creation stage since dharmatā is innate.

Citizen's United pretty much closed the the lid on the idea that taking money necessitated a quid pro quo arrangement, and as a consequence of Citizen's United, it is now very difficult to show quid pro quo arrangements without specific documents proving, for example, that HRC granted favors to to people as a direct result of cash donations to the Clinton Foundation, etc.

In any case, she will at minimum be a competent executive, and if the Dems win the senate, which is a toss up right now, at least we will have liberal supreme court justices on the bench.

You can't blame CLinton because the Iraqi's refused to provide legal protection to US troops fielded to protect their government.

Syria: Clinton advocated not permitted a vacuum in Syria. Mistakes in Syria rest mainly on Obama's shoulders.

Libya: started by NATO, with Clinton's support in response to the 2011 Libyan Civil War. Definitely a geopolitical error on the part of NATO.

Yemen: Every administration has been arming the Saudi's with the latest in high tech weapons. This is a problem wth US foreign policy in general, not Clinton specifically.

You forgot to mention Honduras— now here was twisted reasoning used by State: if they cut off Honduras because of the coup, they would have immediately had to end all humanitarian aid to the region by US law, so they sought to finesse the deal. Bad reasoning by my estimate, but there you have it.

The thing is, she gets no credit for the Iran deal, which is a good thing. A very good thing, despite the GOP hysteria is caused.

A impartial review of her tenure at State here:

dreambow said:
The verdict? Clinton brought a clear vision of U.S. interests and power to the job, and future presidents and secretaries of state will find many of her ideas essential. Yet she struggled to bring together the different elements of her vision into a coherent set of policies. The tension between America’s role as a revolutionary power and its role as a status quo power predates Clinton; the struggle to reconcile those two opposed but equally indispensable aspects of American foreign policy has survived her tenure at the State Department.
She has Wall Street backing her, the bankers and the corporations  don't want any change in the status quo.

Right now in the world, the only place where there is outright war is in the Middle East and parts of Africa. The Western Hemisphere is free of war, apart from social conflict in Venezuela and Central America. Asia is free of war. Europe is free of war. Changing the status quo, as you call it, will result in war over much of the planet. We need to have stable economies and governments so we can tackle the problems posed by climate change properly. If we do not tackle those problems, then we really will be facing a change of the status quo and not one for which anyone will be able to see a favorable outcome.

Trump is dangerous primarily because he is an ignorant fool, something he has proven time and again while campaigning. He is also dangerous because he is a deeply racist man, who indicates his racism with almost every speech he gives, especially when he goes off the message that has been carefully scripted for him by Conway et al (which is also filled with the most egregious lies).  His racism has awoken a kind of xenophobia in the US, a xenophobia that was scripted by the alt-right and something he buys into uncritically. It is no mistake that he and his sons regularly retweet tweets from  @WhiteGenocideTM, Jason Bergkamp, etc. Melania Trump, for example, claimed that Julie Ioffe provoked anti-semitic attacks against herself because Ioffe wrote an piece for GQ that was not merely a puff-piece profile. Racism is a systematic problem in the Trump clan, despite Ivanka's having married into the tribe.

Quite frankly, when stacked up against Clinton, the only reason he has gotten as far as he has is because of the unreasonable hatred for Clinton which has been fueled by right wing mysogyny since the 1970's.

Also what is Dakini energy? What would it be called in Sanskrit? Is it one of the forms of Shakti? Is it Kundalini? Not sure if these are questions that can be answered publicly or not.

Does seeing/touching/tasting the hair of a "true ngakpa" therefore contain some special blessing due to it carrying this special energy?

Ngakpas are people who have shown some juice from their practice of mantra. When I see some practitioners who develop some real juice in their practice, then I will call them ngakpas. Until then, for me, they are just earnest practitioners with aspirations.

My teachers, Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje and Kunzang Dechen Lingpa (both "heart sons" of Dudjom Rinpoche who were with him in Tibet for many years) demonstrated the juice of their practice. The former did several years of retreat on Throma in remote caves in Kongpo, the latter did one week of Vajrakīlaya practice and achieved siddhi (the latter was recognized by Dudjom Rinpoche as the tulku of Terton Longsal Nyingpo).

Ordinations do not create Ngakpas, siddhis do. That is my main point here. Since I do not have siddhis, I don't call myself a Ngakpa, even though I have all the requisite empowerments and so on.

Good luck piercing the aristocratic foundation of the Ngakpa tradition. In Tibet, in terms of one's reputation, one's family comes first, then one's teacher, then one's personal qualities.

For example, I have seen doctors presented as good teachers (who were horrible actually) because their qualities were listed in that order. It really does not fit with the egalitarian model you have in your head, Greg, that "anyone" become a Ngakpa in the traditional Tibetan sense. For example, my teacher, the famed late Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje (d. 1993], made it quite clear that not everyone could just become a weather controller. In order to become a weather controller, you have to have the ability in your bone lineage (father line).

Tibetans translate the term varna as rigs, which means caste, derived from Spanish and Portuguese "casta", ‘lineage, race, breed." But we can also say "color" if you insist, which just shows that Indian civilization is inherently racist, but we knew this already, right?

This is not a dualistic concept any more than the absence of delusion is a dualistic concept. The six realms of samsara don't exist for Buddhas because they are creations of deluded mind and Buddhas are not deluded. Not only does shit not exist for them, any ordinary thing that is perceived by an impure human mind doesn't exist for them, otherwise you are saying that a person with clear sight sees the appearance of floating hairs, they just don't grasp at them! Hallucinations don't exist for people who are not hallucinating.

You do understand that appearances are relative and dependent on the mind, right?

No, there is no contradiction.

Tsongkhapafan said:
Impurity isn't related to Buddha's mind. Buddha's don't see shit, these are hallucinations for impure beings like ourselves. If even gods perceive fluids are nectar, it goes without saying that Buddhas do not perceive impure things.

Malcolm wrote:
Things are neither pure nor impure, "pure and impure" are the dualistic concepts of sentient beings. Buddhas see shit, they just don't relate to it as impure or something to avoid, nor to they relate to gold as something pure to acquire.

Since this is case, if you insist that Buddhas in the human realm do not see water (or do not see pus and blood in a preta realm), I think you are deluded and you do not understand the meaning of conventional truth.

If on the other hand you opine that buddhas do not perceive phenomena such as shit and gold in terms of purity or impurity, then I can go along with this. But to believe that buddhas live in a comic book world of pure lands is naive beyond belief, and it means, as far as I am concerned, you have not understood the real import of the generation stage nor the completion stage.

Malcolm wrote:
No, this isn't true. Buddha explains to one brahmin boy that in the distant past, his family were slaves of the Buddha's clan and were not in fact brahmins. And we know that practically speaking, families do in fact move up and down through the caste system, it is not a fixed as many believe unless you belong to one of the so called "unscheduled castes."

And while it is true that anyone can take some vow and not cut their hair, that is not really what a ngakpa is. A real ngakpa is someone who actually has some realization, someone who has at least generated some heat through practicing Secret Mantra. It is for this reason I don't place very much importance on the so called "ngakpa ordination" or necessarily have a lot of respect for all these people who want to take "ngakpa vows" and go about in religious gear. For example, at base, to really be a candidate for wearing the white lower robe, you must be proficient in tummo, and so on. To really be a candidate for not cutting your hair, you must have the great compassion necessary that ḍākinīs will take up residence in it, etc. Ḍākinīs are not going to inhabit your hair just because you took a vow not to cut it.

then there is this famous Throma Nagmo in Dudjom Tersar.it contains everything, including weapons, and so on, and full ngakpa garment. as i understood, its is conected with this upasaka tradition, but actually also with style how tantrikas used to dress in Oddiyana. Rinpoche explained to us, that you can still se there yogis dressing white (he believes that Oddiyana was in present day Orissa. i was lucky to make pilgrimage with him there).

also, when he gave as Simhamukha in Dudjom tersar, he said there is also everything for become a ngakpa.

im not wearing ngakpa robe all the time, of course. hovewer Rinpoche explained, that robe is something like armour for practicioner, cos when you are wearing a robe, you will not go to pub, and so on. i do wear a robe mainly on the retreats, or when im doing practice. also Dzongsar K.Rinpoche said in his book (Not for happiness, that it is good for us to wear smthing "special" for practice.
