Stupas are descendent from the royal funerary tumulus. There are canonical requirements surrounding the construction of such memorials. There are many considerations. One of them is consideration for the negative karma earned by those who may ignorantly destroy them. Another is the consideration for constructing them correctly. I am quite sure you can find the proper procedures for constructing such a memorial in Tendai literature. You might consult the peace pagoda folks.

I said I would not build a stupa unless I was reasonably certain it would not be desecrated and that I've been advised that building stupas on private property is fraught for that reason.

As for your views, you were the person, I think, who attempted to distinguish yourself as an "ethnic" buddhist as opposed to us "converts." I object to the distinction, since I think it is invalid. You were also the person who brought in the notion of how being raised in family of Buddhists somehow imbued the air with a mysterious aroma that we converts would never know. I merely responded in kind. Most of the ethnic Buddhists I know don't know shit about Buddhism and don't behave like they do.

PadmaVonSamba said:
We imagine there is a self because experience seems continuous. For example, we experience an hour rather than experiencing 7,200 half-seconds.
If you experienced 7,200 specifically arising “me” moments, each one produced by the previous one, the experience, the “feel” that there is a ‘self’ would be less likely to occur.

Malcolm wrote:
That’s because our experience of consciousness is principally memory, given that the present moment of consciousness is always nonconceptual and is subsequently processed into a simulacra  of those impressions.  It’s memory that ties those experiences into an identity projection. Our experiences of moments is preconceptual. Moments are also partless. Arising and perishing are simultaneous.

Biden Is Too Worried About the Deficit, Not Worried Enough About Climate Change, TNR
His infrastructure plan was supposed to be his big shot at climate legislation. It’s not nearly enough.

To meet the emissions targets outlined in the Paris Agreement, experts estimate the United States government will need to spend at least $1 trillion annually, or between 3 to 5 percent of GDP, for a decade. President Biden’s infrastructure plan, unveiled Wednesday amid much fanfare about its climate commitments, doesn’t come close.

Malcolm wrote:
The real fault of this plan is that it is being couched in language of economic nationalism (think Steven Bannon):

Bizarrely, the opening salvo of the White House’s 12,000-word fact sheet on the plan framed it as a response to “the great challenges of our time: the climate crisis and the ambitions of an autocratic China.” While numerous experts have pointed out the urgent need for collaboration with China on climate change, Biden ended his speech on a grand Bush-era note, casting the U.S. as a democratic bastion trapped in an epic battle against foreign autocrats.

Absolutely. What do you think? Climate change doesn't harm creatures? Of course it does... And we also need to rope in water pollution and all the harm from that, excess water usage and all the harm from that, excess land usage and all the harm from that, deforestation and all the harm from that, desertification and all the harm from that, loss of biodiversity and all the harm from that. I'm sure I'm not including everything there.

Malcolm wrote:
Most water pollution comes from human sewage and sources other than water runoff from farms. Water usage will increase, not decrease, under more intensive farming of fruit and nut trees.

The biggest thing that injures biodiversity is farming, followed by housing construction. That's not going away, instead, it will be expanded. Why? Nuts are essential for oils, protein, etc. Without butter or animal fats to cook with, we will need to plant millions of more acres of rape seed, etc. Biofuels are already an environmental disaster, with forests being cut down to plant trees for palm oil, etc.

Since their assumptions do not match the real world, your assertion that there will be less harm with such a conversion is just a speculative fantasy. It can't be tested.

Since you live in a world where our economy is oil-based, etc., not even you can argue that your dietary choices are "less" harming.

Malcolm wrote:

As for your first criteria, there is no evidence less creatures are harmed, since there is no evidence one way or another.

There is no evidence that less pesticides and herbicides or other pest-management solutions will be used if we switched, world wide, to an all plant-based diet.

We will have to rely on more chemical-based fertilizers in the significant absence of animal by-product fertilizer. Water pollution from nitrogen runoff will be the same, as well as chemical pollution.

Then there is the transition period of twenty years where we either support an aging population of domesticated animals until they die a natural death—or kill them all—and prevent their birth, since they will no longer be useful to human beings.

The rate of air pollution from farm vehicles will remain the same for the foreseeable future.

The recommendation to switch to all plant-based diet seems great on the surface, but it itself comes with all kinds of unimagined consequences. Same number of creatures will be killed, or even more, since there will have to be a great increase in planting of nut trees and fruit trees (water intensive, prone to disease and pests, requiring lots of pesticides), etc. One cannot simply declare that one can determine the amount of harm to creatures based on computer models which track carbon.

This is why I continue to suggest that there are other areas where we can make more substantial improvements in terms of harmful human behavior than in the area of diet. People are promoting dietary choice as an area where people feel personally empowered in doing something. On the other hand, just look at the frenzy caused recently in France when the Mayor of Lyon eliminated meat from school lunches. Many people, most people, feel that eliminating meat is harmful to human health. I am not debating that issue, some people seem to do fine on vegan and vegetarian diets, some people do not, nevertheless, the general view of most people in the world is that eating meat is desirable.

Frankly, there are many ways of reducing harm, diet evangelism seems among the most quixotic, and thus, not very effective in accomplishing its stated goals.

With respect to the major causes of water pollution they are non-agricultural effluents: human sewage (30%) is the leading source; followed by farm run off and air pollution (both 20%); then maritime transportation, waste water from industry, oil, and litter. Of course these vary depending on water basin. For example, the Mississippi is mainly polluted by farm runoff; the Thames, the Colorado, and Connecticut river, human sewage, etc.

Decoupling our economy from the burning of fossil fuels will automatically cause a serious drop in harm. This is where people should be focusing their attention. Not on diets.

Calculating the amount of vegans in the world has never been an easy task. Many people combine vegans, vegetarians, and plant-based diets into the same category – even though there is a major difference. Considering that the most progressive countries in the world are reporting a 2-8% vegan population, we can assume that the worldwide number is considerably below 1%.

For example, even though there has been a large surge in vegan interest in South Africa, 99.99% of Africa’s population aren’t vegans. Considering that there are 1.2 billion people living in Africa, and 7.53 billion people living worldwide, it’s easy to understand why the vegan population worldwide is closer to 0.1%.

Basically, the world is only 5% vegetarian. Seems unlikely this is going to change.

Based on both Vedic and Buddhist Traditions, things get worse in Kali-Yuga. But Buddha is one to defy odds. I read once in a Buddhist Tantric Text something to the extent of "May all beings become Buddhas at this very moment". Such a thing is possible! How much more possible is it to create a better future for mankind, heeding the warnings of what may come. We must live as Bodhisattvas. There is always hope.

The most comprehensive analysis to date of the damage farming does to the planet. Here is what the lead research scientist has to say about it.

“A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth, not just greenhouse gases, but global acidification, eutrophication, land use and water use,” said Joseph Poore, at the University of Oxford, UK, who led the research. “It is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car,” he said, as these only cut greenhouse gas emissions.

“Agriculture is a sector that spans all the multitude of environmental problems,” he said. “Really it is animal products that are responsible for so much of this. Avoiding consumption of animal products delivers far better environmental benefits than trying to purchase sustainable meat and dairy.”

Of course, research scientists at the The Queen's College, University of Oxford are well known for just making stuff up and not basing their statements on fact and figures.

And you don't even address the main point behind the claim that animal agriculture kills more animals than plant agriculture, which is that you have to feed the cows. So whatever harm that comes from plant agriculture is multiplied in the case of raising animals for meat, because you have to feed the animals plants.

Overall land use decreases, the area of _cultivated_land increases by double. Since the overall cultivated land use nearly doubles, pesticide and herbicide use will increase exponentially as well, as well as the need to substitute human waste for animal-dung based flail amendments.

The vegan diet is actually slightly more "expensive" than other options:

https://ensia.com/notable/which-diet-ma ... surprised/

The study the above article is based upon:

https://online.ucpress.edu/elementa/art ... l-land-Ten

In fact, the same amount of area under cultivation would be required for the planet to go 100% percent vegan. What changes is usage of land not suitable for growing crops, and that land use gets heavily reduced when you eliminate grazing, etc. On the other hand, that land is not suitable for cultivation in general, which is why it is used for grazing in the first place.

The salient point is that shifting towards a plant-based diet can increase the amount of food available to be eaten by human beings, but it won't a actually reduce the amount of land under cultivation at all (especially when you include biofuel cultivation, such as ethanol). In fact, the amount of land under direct cultivation will increase dramatically. Therefore, your repeated asserted that eliminating animals from the human food chain will result in less creatures being harmed overall is specious at best. There are many good reasons to move away from the baseline American diet, which is wasteful and unhealthy in the long run. But the idea that moving away from meat will reduce the need for the same amount of cropland is demonstrably false. In fact, it dramatically increases for the need for cultivation:




So your idea is plain wrong. If we all moved to a vegan or other plant based diet, there will be at least as many sentient beings harmed since the use of pesticides, herbicides, and other pest control measures will increase, not to mention the "collateral" damage of harvesting, pressing, etc.

The fact of the matter is that there is no ideal dietary choice which insulates one from the economics of samsara. If one thinks so, one should become a Jain or a follower of Devadatta.

I'd hate to derail the thread but does anyone have anything about Karma Chagme and vegetarianism, or why tsok in Drikung is mostly vegetarian?

GrapeLover said:
Karma Chakme's "Comprehensive Critique of Meat" is available in the book "The Faults of Meat" by Geoffrey Barstow.

Here is the conclusion:
For all these reasons, the best option is to perform the holy act of relinquishing all meat. When you perform a ritual feast, use meat with threefold purity in order to guard your samaya. At that time, it is very important simply to not reject meat, alcohol, or dough. Eat only a little, however, an amount equivalent to the leg of an insect. The middle option is to give up meat that was slaughtered for your own sake, or, if you eat other meat, to eat only a little. The least option is to give up the meat of animals killed that day, the meat of animals of a similar species, and human meat. When you do eat it, bless it as divine nectar and consume it as an inner fire offering.
Regarding the least option, he says:
The answer is that such a person must be able to either truly transform the meat into divine nectar or, if they do not transform it into divine nectar, they must be able to transform their body so that they appear as a burial-ground jackal, a tiger, a lion, or the like. After that they can eat. [...] The Vimalaprabhā, the great commentary on the Kālacakra Tantra, explains that if you are unable to turn a tooth into a pearl, a skull-cup into a lotus, meat into sons’ hair, and blood into a heruka deity, then it is unacceptable to eat this. Even if they spend eons trying, ordinary people are unable perform such transformations. Therefore it is widely explained that they should not try to transform these substances into divine nectar by themselves.

Malcolm wrote:

The term "self" is used to designate the parts of a person as a collection. But there is no self in a person, no person in a self, not person or self in an individual, and no such thing as individual, that is to say, an entity that can bear division and analysis.

Likewise, there is no soul.

Claiming that bodhicitta is innate or unacquired is a strange claim. This is not the same as the so-called prakṛtīgotra, natural disposition. Natural disposition means simply that we have a mind, and that mind can become inspired to desire awakening when it meets with proper conditions to develop Mahāyāna bodhicitta. But Mahāyāna bodhicitta is by no means innate, and neither is mahākaruna, the compassion which is absolutely free of reference points. A mother's compassion is very much a referential compassion.

Mahākaruna and bodhicitta are both acquired. How? Through training. If they were unacquired, as you claim, no training would be needed to develop them, but this is clear not the case.

tobes said:
Yes, to be honest I think there is a very big difference between the sentiments of a five year old and the actual realisations of mahakaruna. There is nothing is secretive about this, it is actually a matter of humility to recognise that having bodhicitta properly take stock in our mindstream is an incredible accomplishment. And it is rare. And it is all to easy to conflate this with mere virtuous sentiments and wishful thinking.

Queequeg said:
Nonsense. Mahakaruna is unaquired. It is coextensive with all beings and expresses as our selfless impulses - the love and concern of a parent for a child, the pull of empathy. That's not to say its untainted and undeveloped. Its not a difference of kind but difference of cultivation. Bodhicitta, too, is unacquired. If it was not there to begin with, it could not be manifest.

Malcolm wrote:
Mahakaruna is free of all references, but it begins with the development of regular old karuna. You are essentializing something that is not an essence and has no essence.

Bodhicitta is born out of compassion, it’s not an intrinsic quality of sentient beings.

I noticed that too. That's a common assumption made by some Theravadins (Mahapajapati is a Theravada bhikkhuni monastery). Not all Mahayana schools advocate vegetarian diets, in fact, it's probably just a minority number of schools, mostly being Chan and some Zen schools.


Malcolm wrote:
In fact, though some people assume it is an ipso facto Mahāyāna position, Mahāyānīs such as Bhavaviveka make the argument that as long as the meat is pure in three ways, there is no fault. You will note that that the strongest admonitions against eating meat come from the Yogacāra and Tathāgatagarbha sūtras.

Bhavaviveka recognizes that meat eating is mentioned by the Buddha in Tathāgatagarbha and Yogacāra sūtras, but he clearly considers these admonitions by the Buddha not to be in contradiction with the principle of three-fold purity. He insists that the point of the Buddha was making was not to personally engage in harming animals, because of the Buddha's love for all sentient beings.

He makes the point that there is no mind in dead meat, so there can be no suffering caused by eating that meat. He also dispenses with the idea that meat is impure food, as opposed to milk, etc. He also rejects the idea that eating meat implicitly involves one in killing, pointing out if this is so, then those who wear leather, etc., are also killers, etc.

He also rejects the idea that plants are sentient:

Plants are not sentient
because they are not included within the four types of birth.

The four types of birth are apparitional, heat and moisture, egg, and womb birth. There is no "seed," "rhizome," or "spore" birth.

So this controversy boils down to those Mahāyānīs who follow Madhyamaka and those follow Yogacāra.

Yeah, I think this is generally the standard interpretation, that basically beings can inhabit plants, rocks, etc, as a sort of abode, but the abode is not itself necessarily in-and-of-itself sentient. And so for example in monastic precepts, one should not carelessly cut plants, uproot them, etc, any more than someone should perhaps burn down someone's house. Even if burning down someone's house isn't the same as killing them. Basically.

Most Buddhists would answer “human beings” and more broadly “sentient beings” or “animals”. But there is scientific controversy about sentience and whether plants have sentience; so are plants reborn? And there is scientific controversy whether single-celled organisms which are neither plant nor animal are sentient; so are single-celled organisms reborn? And regarding animals, do they need to have a nervous system to be reborn?

The best book (in my opinion) that fairly discusses both sides is this one by Ven. Dhammika. He takes an unbiased, objective account for both sides.

Traditionally, we can use any western version of the Japanese pronounciation.   If dialect and accent don't matter, what makes the words magic?    Will pronouncing the title in english work?   If not, why not.    If its that the meaning of the words we recite matters then an english pronounciation should work, but coca-cola- being a distraction from the contemplation of the sutra- should not.

But it does not work like that. First, the emptiness realized by arhats is only the emptiness of the person, not of phenomena, and not of the emptiness of the four extremes.

Gorampa Sonam Senge addresses all these issues in his Differentiation of Views. You can look there.

Seeker12 said:
In the Sutra “Introduction to the Domain of the Inconceivable Qualities and Wisdom of the Tathāgatas” the following is a description of the arhat retinue present for the Sutra:

“ They all were established in the true, quintessential nature of all phenomena. They abided without support or foundation in the sphere of space. They had cast aside the deeply ingrained obscuration of the afflictive emotions. They possessed the knowledge of how to enter into the spheres of conduct and wisdom of the omniscient ones. They engaged in the conduct of the bodhisattvas. They were established in a method that revealed the dharmadhātu of all the tathāgatas. They were immersed in the single Dharma method. They had approached omniscience. They were unswerving on the path of omniscience; their minds never turned away from omniscience. Their minds were established in understanding and wisdom. They had perfected the wisdom and insight of omniscience. Their methods and conduct had become steadfast.
The Buddha was also accompanied by sixty-two thousand nuns, including Mahāprajāpatī and Yaśodharā. They, too, had amassed virtuous qualities and were approaching the wisdom of omniscience. They were established in a method that revealed omniscience. They had realized the nonsubstantiality of all phenomena. They were established in the signlessness of all phenomena. They understood the true nature of all phenomena. They were convinced that all phenomena are unproduced, unceasing, and beyond oppositional factors. They were established in inconceivable liberation and meditative absorption. They manifested, spontaneously and nonconceptually, in shapes, bodies, colors, and modes of conduct that were perfectly suited to all the sentient beings to be trained.”

That certainly seems like insight into the twofold emptiness to me, given phrases like “They had realized the nonsubstantiality of all phenomena.”

If we take this Sutra to be authentic, then is it that these initial disciples were basically just Bodhisattvas masquerading as arhats? If so, then which arhats are arhats that are not Bodhisattvas masquerading as arhats? Who are these sravaka arhats that only have the 1/2 insight into emptiness if it was not the initial sravaka disciples?

This thread itself took that turn, shifting the subject to some more general remarks about violent crime in the US.

Its a complicated issue. In general, people don't take Asians in the US seriously. Model minorities that can be ignored. And then layer on the screwed up views of Asian women as sex objects and men as effeminate bit characters or martial arts fighters. Cultural stoicism is taken as weakness and a basis to relegate Asians to an afterthought. The second and third generation Asians are not as stoic and are now speaking up.

The one-volume Lhasa edition of The Melodious Voice of Brahma notes an exchange of letters that took place between the Dalai Lama and Pabongkha around 1930. In the final letters of this exchange the Dalai Lama chastises the lama for his propitiation of Shugden and the spread of the practice at Drepung Monastery which appeared to displease the protector Nechung (gnas chung). Pabongkha replied to the letter saying he only propitiated Shugden as he was the protector of his maternal lineage, and that he henceforth promises to give up the practice. It is clear, however, from the dates given in the colophons of his Shugden-works that Pabongkha's propitiation of Shugden continued after 1930.

I have seen that there are a few sources of Bodhisattva Vows/Precepts. While there is significant overlap I also did notice that there are some differences between the sets of Precepts/Vows. So for my own practice I thought of combining them and then making effort to follow them in their entirety so that I dont miss out on anything (meaning that I wont be committing Bodhisattva offenses without knowing them).

I am sure that there is nothing wrong with this.

If someone has received the Madhyamaka tradition of Bodhisattva vows, that is sufficient. There is no need to mix them with the Yogacara system. But of course, one can observe both traditions, since they are not in contradiction.

We could examine this historically and we would have to conclude that many people experienced complete oppression during the entirety of their lifetime and this went on for generations.  In the case of the United States it eased up on oppression at multiple points in it's history and sometimes clamped down again later.  It's historical thrust is toward democracy , which is likely to happen at some point after my death.  Nonetheless it is not guaranteed.

No, but it argues against your case.

kirtu said:
In the case of the other countries, two of them also experienced differences in their oppression.  In the case of North Korea, a change in government/society could be rapid but this can also not be predicted.

But this is the issue wrt climate change: forces in the US, Russia and China are blocking any effective action to addressing climate change at the exact moment in history that the problem was identified and it's seriousness was also recognized.  So if all three nations change in 50 years, it will be much too late to address the problem (and it's already 40 years later than it should have been).

Malcolm wrote:
Oh, its already too late.

kirtu said:
So, yes, 50-100 years generally wipes away the current oppression - but this is 2 to 3 full generations of people enmeshed in direct oppression - and particular moments in history matter much more than others.  1980-2100 are CRUCIAL in moving the planet to a livable future trajectory and we aren't responding to the challenge.

Malcolm wrote:
No, the changes we have wrought on our environment are irreversible, sans a complete and global reorientation around energy use, food supply, access to technology, etc. We have to figure out how to live in this altered environment we have created.

In the Satya Yuga there is no need for the Dharma, so it really does not appear. The Dharma only appears when there is sufficient suffering among human beings to warrant the advent of a buddha.

Könchok Chödrak said:
I'm thinking, isn't the Dharma an active thing? Are there not many Buddhas in Satya Yuga, and that is why it is so flourishing? Yes, the Dharma is a cure for an ailment, but Buddha also means life. Amida Buddha's Pure Land, for example, has no suffering, but there must be Dharma there! And Satya Yuga is a cyclical Yuga, it comes, stays for some long time, but then there has been a degradation again, so there are these cycles. The living beings in Satya Yuga must meditate into the future to see their future births and see how they can help suffering humanity, or at least prepare themselves for lives in the subsequent Yugas if they are Bodhisattvas, willing to be reborn to help the suffering. I have heard Thich Nhat Hanh say in a Dharma talk that there must even be suffering in the Spiritual World [a World beyond this material manifestation], but I personally believe that there can be Dharma without suffering, and that Buddhas can create Pure Lands anywhere. Despite decline in society, we must understand that decline is not perpetual due to hopelessness. There will be a renewal again, because of the Flower of the Dharma, because of Buddhists like you. You may be one, but there are many like you! And what are you doing if not making the world a better place and only that? Eventually, there will be so many such people that humanity will begin to solve it's problems, but sadly there may be a great decline before that happens, yet, such a sadness is not set in stone. It is possible for Earth's climate to be saved if people work together. What is the reason and meaning for Buddhahood? If everyone was a Buddha there wouldn't even be a Saha world, and the Earth itself would be liberated from any burden!

Malcolm wrote:
I did not say there was no Dharma in Sukhavati. I said that during a golden age, on this world, there is no advent of a buddha.

Are you not constructing a positive definition of Emptiness by describing it as being "like space"? If not, are you suggesting space has independent existence or "essence"?

Is the concept of space one with the senses and the aggregates, a product of sense and the aggregates or completely apart from sense and the aggregates?

If it is the former two then have you not taken a position opposite to what you have previously claimed?

If it is the latter then are you saying space has independent existence?

In such a case all beings would be liberated after a single life and there would be no need for a path

In the traditional view, ordinary beings remain essentially unconscious during the bardo of clear light and regain consciousness in the bardo of becoming. Their mindstream, karma and afflictions remain intact

Yes and no. The Bodhisattva Path is needed and noble because the Bodhisattva understands reality and can avoid rebirth, but chooses to return to a world of suffering with the intention to end all suffering for all sentient beings - here and now.

My point is that a sentient being not familiar with the “so-called child luminosity” is unprepared at death for the direct experience of the “so-called mother luminosity” and having no refuge is overwhelmed; while a practitioner familiar with the “so-called child luminosity” recognizes the “so-called mother luminosity” and may be able to maintain awareness for rebirth. As for your second question, the experience of luminosity itself is insufficient to eliminate afflictions. One has to recognize and remain in that luminosity.
While an experience of the “so-called child luminosity” is not sufficient to eliminate all afflictions, the direct experience of the “so-called mother luminosity” is not possible with afflictions. Luminosity is already the nature of your mind, so it is quite clear that luminosity does not eradicate afflictions. Only insight has that power.

The eight deity Mahakala tradition is rooted in mahayoga.

Sapan lightly criticized some perspectives about Dzogchen in Three Vows, but in Illuminating the Intent of the Muni, he recognizes Atiyoga as the pinnacle of the nine vehicles, indicating that his criticism of the nine yānas was limited to claims about the nine yānas having different views.

Volan said:
these termas from Nyang that, as you have mentioned are practiced in the Sakya tradition since the 14th century, are associated with the nine yana Nyingma system and this Guru Drakpo might be associated with Dzogchen. Doesn`t that contradict the views of the earlier patriarch?

Malcolm wrote:
The Sakya masters did not reject Dzogchen. They rejected certain interpretations of Dzogchen. At the present time, His Holiness Sakya Trichen, His Holiness Sakya Trizen, all accept and teach cycles related to Dzogchen, like the King's Tradition of Avalokiteśvara from the Mani Kabum, Chime Phagma Nyingthig, The Termas of Apaṃ Terton, etc. Not only this, but the Nyangral Guru Dragmar is included in the Collection Of All Sādhanas, along with some other termas, like the Lama Gongdu, also critized by Chak Lotsawa. But Chak Lotsawa also criticized Chod and Zhijey, both of which are accepted systems now in all schools.

Unknown said:
Finally, the Khon Brothers did not "stop" the Nyingma lineage. That's ridiculous and offensive. In fact, the reading transmission for the five early Dzogchen lungs of Vairocana was preserved by Khon Konchog Gyalpo and passed on by him.

Malcolm wrote:
One of the gurus of Khon Konchog Gyalpo was Tanak Gö Lotsāwa , who transmitted the Guhyasamaja cycle to him. Je Tsonghkapa mentions him as one of the three main figures in transmitting Guhyasamaja in Tibet (the other two are Lhodrak Marpa and Rinchen Sangpo).  Gö Lotsāwa was famous for critising the authenticity of some of the Nyingma tantras and Sakya Pandita also admitted that there are a lot of fabricated tantras in nyingma ( "Reply to the Translator from Chak" in the "A Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes"). Gorampa includes the following nyingma tantras that were composed by Tibetans: Kun byed rgyal po; the mDo dgongs 'dus; the Zhi khro sgyu 'phrul; the Lha mo'i skyis rgyud; the Bam ril thod mkhm; the sNang brgyad, the Las dge sdig bstan pa, and others. You can see the famous dzogchen tantra in that list.
Yes, Go Lotsawa was also famous for being extremely jealous of Drokmi and criticizing him harshly, even though Drokmi was by far the better translator, so they say. Having read Go's text, it is not a very impressive critique, and is not supported by the Gongma. For example, Go claims that Ma Rinchen Chok composed the Guhyagarbha, but Jetsun Drakpa Gyaltsen defends its authenticity. Go accuses Nubchen of forging the five lungs of Vairocana, but we know that Khon Konchok Gyalpo was instrumental in passing the transmission of these texts onward, and texts like the Cuckook of Vidyā are found in Dunhuang. Sapan mentions that he received Dzogchen teachings, and one of his most important students, Gyalwa Yangonpa, was famed for claiming his realization came from Dzogchen.

The Gelukpas accept the Tārā Tantra, whose authenticity is disputed by Ngorchen. Kalacakra was rejected by Rendawa. The Nyingmapas such as Rokben were skeptical of the mother tantras with their new-fangeled cakras and nadis, and so on.

Read the story about Geshe Drepa. This story is very widespread, you can hear this both from gelugpas and from kagyupas.
This is the example of kadampa tantric practices.

The Kadampas all had various kinds of backgrounds in general. So, one just cannot make a blanket declaration, "all they practiced was kriya tantra." It isn't accurate.

The Khon family have always maintained a close relationship with Nyingma terma tradition, right up to the present day. I ought to know. I am a Sakyapa by tradition. The Ngorpas are the ones who were principally hostile to the terma tradition. The Tsharpas, from Tsarchen onwards, were favorably disposed to the terma tradition.
Any examples from 11th-14th century?

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, the Sakya protectors, Pañjaranatha Mahākala, Palden Lhamo, and the Karmanāthas, are all from combined gter ma and bka' ma lineages.

Then there are the revelations of Nyang, especially Guru Drakpo, as well as the King's Tradition of Avalokiteśvara from the Mani Kabum, which have been practiced in the Sakya tradition since the 14th century.

There are other systems where this is the case as well, for example, in the Khandro Nyinthig, there is a five buddha family peaceful deitiy practice, but no wrathful deity practice, other than Yogini and Hayagriva. Yangzab is actually a branch of the Khandro Nyinthig.

In reality, the Yangzab Shitro is more like the Guhyagarbha system, where there are separate sadhanas for the peaceful deities and the wrathful deities.

Microsoft formally started its work on a decentralized identity scheme in 2017 and has slowly built out the infrastructure over the past few years. The system is based on the Bitcoin blockchain and uses an open protocol called Sidetree to add records of transactions—in this case, identity verifications—to the blockchain. Microsoft says Azure Active Directory verifiable credentials uses a custom but still open source implementation of Sidetree called Identity Overlay Network. Organizations will be able to run their own ION “node” to verify and store identifiers for their members, like citizens, students, or employees.

neither a hair of meditation
nor a second of distraction. 

There are two in thögal:
light practice 
and dark practice.

And:

Since the supreme critical point of buddhahood through understanding
is this unsurpassed trekchö, 
that is the meaning of distinguishing mind and vidyā.

And:

For example, like a polished mirror
in which any kind of image is clear. 
if the meaning of trekchö is not clear, 
even though thögal arises, it will have subject and object.

And:

Without trekchö, there is no thögal. 
Without thögal, there is no trekchö.

In 2017 and 2018, many poured money into cryptocurrency startups through a controversial fundraising method called initial coin offerings. Such booms preceded a rise in trading groups that manipulated the price of cryptocurrencies, causing losses for others.

The value of these digital collectibles depends on the assumption that someone else is willing to pay more for it than you did, analysts say, noting similarities between their big gains and recent social-media-fueled frenzies in meme stocks like GameStop and Koss that led to heavy losses for some individual investors.

“There are people who have been conditioned by cryptocurrencies to believe that just the fact that it can be owned makes it valuable,” said Jorge Stolfi, a computer science professor at Brazil’s State University of Campinas. “People just 100% believe that this thing has value, but in fact it doesn’t because there’s no way to get value out of it except for selling it to another investor.”

For those lulled by today’s bull market, remember that you own a piece of paper. Low-yielding U.S. Treasury bills and bonds are safe because they are backed by the U.S. government, by cash flow of tax dollars and by the country’s assets (think land, not Fort Knox). Stocks are backed by expectations of future earnings, but if you overpay during periods of high expectations (like today), then your downside is huge. Crypto is backed simply by the faith of those who proclaim it is a store of value. Even art and exotic cars and silly NFT tokens are backed only by faith the wealthy will overpay for uniqueness.

Blockchain’s sluggish transaction speed is a major concern for enterprises that depend on high-performance legacy transaction processing systems.9 A lack of standards and interoperability between various blockchain platforms and solutions is another challenge.10 Unless blockchain technology can be readily connected to existing enterprise systems, it will be of little utility in large programs and initiatives. Legal and regulatory concerns around data privacy, intellectual property, enforceability of contracts, and choice of jurisdiction are inhibiting the technology’s adoption.11 And businesses are constrained by blockchain’s technical complexity, which limits the feasibility of implementing distributed ledger systems.

Seems to me blockchain's primary application so far is to create hype and expensive consultants.

Service providers agree to provide security for ones proprietary data. That’s not true with a blockchain applications. Blockchain requires third party intervention to manage data integrity.

Blockchain only functions if every node has a full copy of the data. That’s inherently inefficient. That’s why it can’t scale.

That is not quite right. You have to refresh your memory. According to Abhidharma, that is accepted by Madhyamaka and other schools, perception takes place in a rapid sequence of stages, first you perceive a "thing", then you project an identity, like a car, person, frog, snake etc.., then you perceive what you perceive. (This is a simplified version of it.) This exists in the Sravakayana Abhidharma already, it is not a product of the later developments of Dharma, (You should be aware of this).

They aren't direct indicators of bitcoin's long term value but the money they are generating is being spent to build out the industry.

For example and to the topic. One of the purchasers of the art mentioned that it might lose all value over the term but the investment into the future of virtual art was worth the investment at face value. Reportedly young people making a seeming windfall in digital currency incites discretionary spending. From what I understand the artists received compensation from these sales driving some of the momentum.

PeterC said:
What’s being “built out”, exactly?

The people doing work on distributed records in actual real world applications are a completely different set of people from the Bitcoin fanboys on social media. What cryptocurrency is promoting investment in is wasteful use of resources to “create” something that has zero utility.

The idea that ‘virtual art’ is somehow comparable to editions of prints or photos is nonsense. Editions only have value if they are limited editions.  Open editions are very hard to sell and priced very low, because they have no scarcity value. Virtual art is not even comparable to open editions. Why?  Because you can download exactly the same thing for a cost of zero.

At this juncture, it seems that the best use for blockchain databases is logistics tracking in a supply chain. But blockchain databases begin to degenerate in performance when the datasets become large and complex.

A relational database is as secure as the network it is set up on and the servers in which it sits. It is generally much superior to a blockchain database in terms data integrity (aka normalization), speed, and so on, when working with multiple data points in a complex environment. Its performance can suffer if encryption is required on tables in the database itself. But encryption load can also be downside of blockchain databases.

So again, it just depends on the application. Remember, everything looks like a nail to a hammer.

We certainly know that there is a historical consensus about what constitutes the Dharma: absence of personal and phenomenal identity; emptiness; dependent origination; rebirth caused by affliction; karma and its results; four truths of nobles; and so on.

That historical consensus, consistent for over two thousand years, is sufficient to infer what was taught by the historical Buddha. The principles he enunciated are more important than the books in which they were eventually written down.

The problem with your method, and indeed the method of post-Schopen Buddhology, is that it is materialist, and only accepts direct perception as a valid authority.

However, in Buddhadharma, the historical consensus shows across cultures, time, and sects, three forms of authority are acceptable in Buddhadharma: valid direct perception; inferences based on valid direct perception; and testimony of reliable witnesses.

On the eleventh bhumi, the four noble truths are not just truths in terms of ethical understanding and discipline, but they become wisdom, or jnana. You experience their absolute truth. You have actually understood at last what you began with as a student on the path of accumulation. You have made a complete circle, but in this case you have done it with more understanding. Previously, you were just tossed and challenged by the consequences of the truth, rather than understanding it as jnana, or higher truth. That process is very important; it makes the whole thing very real. In the end, you have not bypassed anything, but you are returning to the origin—to the source of your original inspiration at the level of the first path. Tantric scriptures say that you might feel enormously resentful that the journey was a complete put-on, a sort of pacifier. Nevertheless, you did make a journey, and you did get somewhere.
Chögyam Trungpa makes this claim in the book "The Bodhisattva Path of Wisdom and Compassion" about Buddhas having reached the 11th bhumi.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, for example, there is this passage from the Vairocana Aural Lineage in the Gongpa Zangthal:

The dharmas of the nine vehicles are like a blind man's cane, like the scaffold for a building, like the hem of a robe, like a limb of the body and are not indispensable. Though they exist, they are not essential. The teaching of the Great Perfection is like giving a blind man eyes, and having gained sight, has no need for the cane. Like the pillar that supports the building, since the building is supported in the center, the scaffolding can be removed. Since the body has a heart, limbs can be lost.



Lingpupa said:
2) if it is true that dzogchen (presumably including space, mind and instruction classes, rushen trekchod, thogal) is not what ati yoga is about, then what teachings, practices, or anything do belong to the ati yoga class? What else does it contain?

Malcolm wrote:
Atiyoga, in this context, is the completion stage of anuyoga. In the commentary on the Tantra Without Syllables attributed to Vimalamitra, we find two kinds of Ati yoga mentioned, "the proponents of Ati who assert words that are approximations" and "those who are beyond words and expressions are those of the unmistaken Atiyoga."

In the Commentary to the Tantra Without Syllables, pp. 166, it is stated:

Since the reality of inexpressible Atiyoga cannot be illustrated by the path of the partisan tenets of the nine vehicles, it naturally cannot be illustrated by their different terminologies. Therefore, since there is no grasping to the different objects of the five sense gates in the mode of being of entities, it cannot be confirmed with words. Therefore, it is explained that yogis who adhere to words are deviating into the common vehicles.

In the list, wisdom through hearing-wisdom through reflection-wisdom through meditation, does the word wisdom refer to the same wisdom (namely direct vision of 4TN = 4 Truths of the Noble) or is it three fundamentally different types of wisdom. Is it possible, based on the analysis of the Pali / Sanskrit grammar of the original text (sutra), to give an unambiguous answer to the question posed above? The background of my question is that in the time of the Buddha and not only there were cases of enlightenment at the moment of listening to the dharma. I.e. the hearing was just a trigger.

Malcolm wrote:
There are three trainings: śila, samadhi, and prājña. In the category of prajñā are the prajña's of hearing, reflection, and cultivation. They are different. The first is hearing a dharma topic; the second is reflecting on its meaning; the third is integrating into the path. Only the third is pure wisdom, the first two are conceptual.

It was born in the bloodshed of the war of king of Tsang. The 7th Dalai Lama was politically weak, as were the 8th-12th.

The political situation of Tibet was precarious at best, and actually saw very few periods of overall peace and prosperity. We can see this actually in the flourishing of the first renaissance in Tibet, from 1000 to roughly 1250. Then again, from roughly 1400-1500. Otherwise, Tibetan history was filled with a lot of war, violence, and power struggles.

Malcolm wrote:
Dzogchen takes ye shes as the path. The nine yānas take mind as the path. This is the basic difference between Dzogchen and the Nine Yānas.

There are some similarities between general Dzogchen language and Kagyu Mahāmudra language, because Milarepa and Gampopa were both raised in the Nyingma tradition. Not only this, but Dzeng Dharmabodhi exchanged teachings with Gampopa, the former teachings the space series, the latter teaching mahāmudra.

The basic point that Rongzom and Mipham make is that in Dzogchen, the absence of gnosis in the result is not an absence of gnosis per se. In Dzogchen, gnosis is the basis. Recognizing that gnosis is the path. The gnosis lacking the result is the two-fold gnosis. It is a complicated issue, totally beyond the scope of this forum or my energy to address.

There are a variety of opinions out there.

He maintained that only direct introduction and so-called "meaning empowerments" could be given online. There are a number of other teachers who happen to agree with ChNN's stance on this point.

In the end, one has to follow one's own feelings. No one should be surprised if they attended an online empowerment, live or recorded from one teacher, only to be told by another teacher the latter do not consider that a valid means of empowerment.

I’ll be honest, I believe I’m confusing the categories above that you said most people stumble on.

What Rongzom is making a distinction between is the pristine consciousness of the basis, which he equates with self-originated pristine consciousness and nonconceptual pristine consciousness, which is relative and arises from concepts.

So what does he say "self-originated" pristine consciousness is? He states that is the luminous nature of the mind. This is the only kind of "pristine consciousness" a buddha can be said to posses. But we also posses this, right now.

He details three basic kinds of gnosis or pristine consciousness: non-conceptual, pure-mundane, and self-originated. The first two are two types of gnosis with which we are generally familiar. The third is the so-called "self-originated gnosis."

Rongzom is arguing merely that all phenomena are self-originated gnosis:

"Observe that all experiential ranges self arise as self-originated pristine consciousness." Experiential range refers to the experiential range of the sense organs of the six migrating beings. Self-originated pristine consciousness refers to the fact that since all formations are peaceful by nature, pristine consciousness self-originated.

Nice try. It’s not that matter is mind stuff, but with the action of sentient beings in the world, matter, the four elements won’t arise. The reason the universe forms (repeatedly) is due to the afflictions and karma of sentient beings. Thus it is axiomatic that matter arises from mind, since only the mind, as Candra puts it, is capable of being a creator. Matter is not  so capable.

Hey Malcolm,

Just so I’m I know I’m understanding you correctly. Rongzom’s main contention is with people who believe that the the so called twin Gnosis of the Buddha’s exist substantially as constituents of enlightenment itself.he believes they are the illusionary means Manifested by Buddha’s due to there past aspirations/compassion to assist sentient beings and lead them towards enlightenment alone. Rongzom/Gampopa would both agree though that in Buddhahood there is a so called Gnosis, but that it’s only constituents are the purified space of the Dharmadhatu which is ultimately inconceivable. Is this correct?

No, they do not agree that there is gnosis in buddhahood. They expressly deny this position. Gampopa states it clearly here:

On Monday, March 1, Dr. James Benn of McMaster University is giving the lecture “Meditation in the Apocryphal Śūraṃgama Sutra” at Harvard. He notes, “In the later Chinese Buddhist tradition [this] text above all others has been extolled for the profundity of its ideas, the beauty of its language, and its insight into the practice of meditation.”

No wonder it was one of the Manchu Qianlong Emperor’s favorite texts. Because this sutra did not exist in Tibetan, one of the major translation projects undertaken by Qianlong and his Imperial Preceptor Changkya Rolpai Dorje was its translation from Chinese into Tibetan, as well as Mongolian and Manchu. Our library holds a copy of this Tibetan translation published in Beijing in 1779, and readers can see that it contains a preface from the Emperor himself. As it turns out, Professor Benn notes that scholars have concluded that Śūraṃgama is an apocryphal sutra fabricated in Chinese in the eighth century, with no Indic original.

The sutra begins with the seduction of the Buddha’s disciple Ānanda by a courtesan. On the brink of breaking his vow of celibacy, he is rescued by the Buddha’s recitation of the Śūraṃgama mantra. Mortified at his failing, Ananda makes a request for this teaching, the basis of the sutra, which can be said to be about Buddhist theories of consciousness. The Buddha says to Ānanda citing the benefits of the Śūraṃgama sutra and the Śūraṃgama mantra: “Ānanda, even in an infinite number of eons I could not fully describe the benefit that beings will gain from reciting this Sutra and from holding this mantra in their minds. By relying on this teaching that I have given you, and by practicing just as I have instructed you, you will go directly to full awakening without creating any more karma that would lead to entanglement in the demonic.”

Malcolm wrote:
A hindu, by definition will not have a proper insight into emptiness because they do not possess the view of dependent origination.

The two samadhis are the same: what is different is the person who is in those samadhis. In the case of hindus, that samadhi is not liberative, think of it as super-śamatha. In the case of a buddhist, it is the samadhi that arises beyond the āyatana of neither perception nor nonperception, the highest state of samsara, and is the samadhi that destroys all remaining traces of latent affliction, hence it is called "vajra-like."

It does and it doesn't. The lung for everything in the Bka' 'gyur exists. Not everything in the bstan 'gyur has a lung.

And why don't non-Tibetan schools do lung? And what about teacher who recommend or ask students to read certain books without giving lung?

Malcolm wrote:
Prior to the destruction of Buddhism in China in 845, there was a very robust tradition of sutra recitation in Chinese Monasteries. The same goes for Indian Buddhism. It is likely Tibetan custom of giving lungs comes from this. Also, there was more literacy in China and Indian than there ever was in Tibet until modern times. So reading transmissions are also an opportunity for people to hear books they otherwise could not read. And paper was scarce and expensive in Tibet, so only elite scholars actually could afford more than a few books.

If someone's teacher tells you to read a book, you should read it. If you want to give the transmission yourself, better get the lung.


Matt J said:

Since the mainline of Madhyamaka schools accept the Śravakayāna model of cognition, a sense consciousness only arises when the sense organ meets a sense object, this itself is a confirmation of the idea that Madhyamaka conventionally accepts object which exist independent of the mind.

Also, if sattvas are infinite (and that is a fraught conception, but since we're wallowing in conceptions here, why not?) then its not possible to say that there is any increase or decrease, and so the implication that sattvas are infinite seems as plausible an implication as saying they are finite.

Following up on this - it is thus interesting that manodhatu, manovijnanadhatu and dharmadhatu, at least in the kamadhatu, all are associated with vitarka and vicara. The implication being that all three - the mind organ and mind objects as well as conciousness are not rupa (form).

This stands in contrast to Western Scientific Materialism that reduces the mind organ, its objects and consciousness to matter.

I was not sure what vitarka and vicara were, so I looked it up. A footnote refers to Ch. 2, vv. 28 & 33. That was not particularly helpful.
Ch. 2, V. 33 reads:
"Vitarka and vicara are grossness and subtlety of the mind."
The footnote there says this definition is from some unknown sutra.

These are caitasika - mental factors.

Vitarka is translated as "thoughts," "applied thought," or "applied attention" in the Princeton Dictionary of Buddhism. It "refers to the momentary advertence toward the chosen object of attention." It is of an indeterminate moral quality and can refer both to the ordinary mind turning from one object to the next, or it can refer to the direction of the mind to an object of contemplation in the first dhyana, dropping off thereafter.

Vicara is translated as "sustained thought," "sustained attention," "imagination," and "analysis" in the PDB. It is "the continued pondering of things." It is of an indeterminate moral quality and can refer to sustained thinking about an object in ordinary mind as well as sustained contemplation in the dhyanas, including the first dhyana.

This section considers the Eighteen Dhatus from the perspective of the factors of vitarka and vicara.

The consciousnesses associated with externalities - visual, auditory, olfactory, oral and tactile consciousnesses all include both vitarka and vicara. This is clear - visual consciousness can either be adverting to an object or sustaining attention to an object.

Now, with regard to the manodhatu (mental organ), manovijnanadhatu (mental consciousness), and dharmadhaytu (mental objects), in the Kamadhatu, they all have both vitarka and vicara. They are both present in the first dhyana. In the second, third and fourth dhyanas, there is no vitarka but there is vicara. Once one has turned their attention to an object, and one capable of the dhyanas is by definition capable of maintaining attention, vitarka is done. In the arupadhatu, where beings manifest without manodhatu, vicara drops away.

The 5 sense organs and their 5 respective objects do not have vitarka and vicara because these are factors of mind.

Interesting discussion.

The following post is from about 3.5 years ago; but I remembered about it, and thought I’d search it up:



Losal Samten said:
Presumably because just as time is infinite, so are sentient beings, so mathematically speaking there's always going to be someone that's out of reach. (IIRC that was one Yogacarin argument for the existence of icchantikas?)

Some sutras state that the sattvadhatu neither increases nor decreases (anunatvaapurnatva), is this to be only understood in the non-conceptual ultimate sense, or relatively too, since whether infinity +1, or infinity -1, it still equals infinity?

Malcolm wrote:
This point is addressed by Longchenpa at the end of the difficult points chapter in the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle.He resolves the difficulty by stating that while all sentient beings are liberated at the end of the great eon, because there is never any limit to latent traces in the dharmadhātu, new sentient beings can always arise. He claims these two points of view are not contradictory.


Sādhaka said:
Apparently contradictory, but as stated: It’s one of those difficult points.

Malcolm wrote:
Since there are latent sentient beings, there are never actually any “new” ones. Liberation also does not mean a sentient being vanishes.

What fixes that limit is just the fact that no new sentient beings come into existence. Its a consequence of dependent origination. It is a finite set; it may be uncountable, but it is still finite.

PadmaVonSamba said:
Although sentient beings occur,
There is nothing essential that truly exists
that can be defined as a “sentient being”,
Just as a tiger chasing one in a dream may certainly have a form, and may even produce in one a feeling  of fear (the dreaming person may even toss and turn and sweat, and of course everything that is a result has a cause!) and in that sense it occurs, it happens for sure, but ultimately none of it exists.

The English translation can be found here :

https://daitangkinh.net/Books/T16n0668/ ... Rulu).html

Not really convincing in terms of explaining "finite number of sentient beings" imho... In fact the text does not discuss if there is a finite or infinite number but declares "increase and decrease in sentient beings" as a wrong view. It equates the dharma realm which neither increases or decreases with the real of sentient beings. So that is clear but it does not discuss if there is a finite or infinite number of sentient beings. Or am I missing something?

Malcolm wrote:
There has to be a limit to sentient beings, otherwise, where do new sentient beings come from? It is not possible for there to be brand-new sentient beings.

It just stands to reason that there is a finite number of sentient beings, despite that number being beyond any comprehension.

Johnny Dangerous said:
Two independent studies by Griffiths et al. (2016) and Ross et al. (2016) demonstrate that psilocybin, a serotoninergic psy- chedelic, can produce a rapid and clinically significant decrease in the symptoms of depression and anxiety, which can persist for up to six months. Each study utilized a double-blind design and employed different active control compounds to address design- based confounds associated with the use of a psychoactive drug. Griffiths et al. (2016) used a low dose (1–3 mg) of psilocybin, while Ross et al. (2016) selected niacin. It is worth noting that the placebo effect is a major confound in the development of novel antidepressant drugs, as placebos can produce antidepressant effects in 30–40% of individuals (Papakostas et al., 2016). Psilocybin treatment was associated with statistically significant antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in both studies. The use of two separate control compounds (including a subclinical dose of psilocybin as control) minimizes the potential outcome that the effects are due to placebo rather than an active drug effect.

Hi Magnus:

I addressed this discrepancy above. Some people consider arising without a seed syllable "Dzogchen development," but it is really just instant anuyoga creation stage. In Dzogchen proper, there is no creation and completion stage. In Dzogchen proper, there is no deity to create at all. Not understanding this point, many people mistake terms like "Dzogchen generation" for the actual practice of Dzogchen. You can ascertain this by looking up creation/generation stage in the index of the Tantra Without Syllables. But in particular, the deviations of the nine yānas are explained on pg. 180-181.

In the gradual approach, the three samadhis are summarized by the recollection of Samanbhadra, Samantabhadri, that is, pristine consciousness and the dhātu respectively, whose union results in the child, the seed syllable. In gradual Anuyoga sadhanas, there may be nominal jñānasattva, but the view is emphasized that there is no actual separation between the samayasattva and jñānasattva and nothing actually is invoked.

There is only one explanation of the three inner tantras: a Nyingma one. There is no such thing as a "Kagyu approach to the three inner tantras."

Although if you want to practice with inviting the Jnanasattva in a Anuyoga Sadhana, it is part of Narag Tongtrug, if I’m not mistaken.

But yea I don’t think that it is usually included in Anuyoga Sadhanas in general.

Yes, there are Anuyoga sadhanas that have lines to the effect, "the jñānasattva and the samayasattva are nondual from the beginning, rest in the state of that recognition" and so on.

I ran this by someone who is fluent in Tibetan and has done the traditional Nyingma 3 year retreat. He said that as long as a dirty was involved the jnanasattva is invited at the beginning of the sadhana.

It is an academic issue for me since I don’t practice the higher Tantras. But I thought that since this is a public forum the misinformation should be tagged.

Babur, the founder of the Mughal Empire, and his warriors visiting a Hindu temple in the Indian subcontinent.
The Mughal Empire was founded by Babur (reigned 1526–1530), a Central Asian ruler who was descended from the Turco-Mongol conqueror Timur (the founder of the Timurid Empire) on his father's side, and from Genghis Khan on his mother's side. [41] Ousted from his ancestral domains in Central Asia, Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions.[42] He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass.[41] Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526.[41] The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.[43]

Schrödinger’s Yidam said:
My basic point was about looking at the issue of betting one’s practice regarding jnanasattvas with a cost/benefit analysis:

What does one gain by being dismissive of their nature if they are imaginary? Or what if they are valid? And what do you lose in both cases?

What does one gain by taking their nature  seriously if they are imaginary? Or what if they are valid? And what do you lose in both cases?

By betting they aren’t valid it costs you nothing, but you might be passing up something immensely valuable.

By betting they are valid you are potentially exposing yourself to criticism for being foolish, so there is a cost. But if they are valid you can also have immense benefit.

Is possibly looking foolish worth it for what might be offered? For me, yes. But then again looking foolish is a fairly common occurrence for me. So I don’t care much.

Can a Buddhist beleive in God and still be a Buddhist? I say yes. I beleive if you say no to such a question you are missing the point of the all-inclusivensess of Buddhism. There are many beleif systems, for example many people (and not just the Hindus) beleive and beleived that Buddha is God Himself. His birth was predicted thousands of years before He was born in a Vedic Purana (The Bhagavatam Purana), describing Him as the Lord. Many people of Buddha's time such as the common peasants of the towns He walked through, when they encountered Him, beleived Him to be God. Such was the idea of advanced mendicants in India back in the day. What does your compassion and Dharmic Love tell you about who Buddha is, and what is behind His Emptiness?

Creation stage is something predicated on an Abhidharma model of a putative person, unlike Ronald McDonald. A deity is not an integral person anymore than we are. This is demonstrated by the Guru's three seats, for example, from whom we take empowerment, the five buddhas, their consorts, the male and female bodhisattvas, and the ten wrathful ones. We do not actually receive empowerment from a guru as an integral person, because an integral person is just a fiction. To break down that fiction, we substitute another fiction: the mandala.

A jnanasattva is also a purely imagined representation. It’s a method, but there is no inherently existing jnanasattva to invoke and absorb. It’s just a creation stage symbol, so wholly imagined and conceptualized.

Secondary practices work because the process of reciting mantras function through accumulating merit and dependent origination, but they are still just conceptual because they are part of our dualistic experience.

Vow 18
Provided I become a Buddha, if the beings of the ten quarters who after having heard my name, and thus awakened their highest faith and aspiration of re-birth in that country of mine, even they have recollected such a thought for ten times only, they are destinated to be born there, with the exception of those who have committed the five deadly sins (Anantarya), and who have blasphemed the orthodox Law (Dharma), otherwise may I not attain the enlightenment.

Vow 19
Provided I become a Buddha, if the beings of ten quarters who have directed their thoughts towards the Bodhi and cultivated their stock of various merits with a fervent craving for re-birth in that country of mine, if at the moment of death, should I not appear with an assembly of retinue before them, then may I not attain the enlightenment.

Vow 20
Provided I become a Buddha, if the beings of ten quarters, after having heard my name always longing for that country of mine and cultivating various essential merits for the purpose of realizing their earnest wish to be born in my country, should their fulfillment be failed, then may I not attain the enlightenment.

While there are somewhat extreme views of so-called other power in Japanese Buddhism, there are restrictions placed upon who can take birth in Sukhavati, what grade they will be born as, etc.

And this idea of "call" is Shinran's rereading. The text actually says "hear."

Further, there are many sūtras, where based on the pranidhanas or aspirations of a given bodhisattva, their resultant buddhafield will admit the aspirant. For example, the Medicine Buddha pureland can be accessed by minimally reciting the Bhaisajyaguru dhāraṇi seven times a day, etc.

Here's a stab at an analysis of that - Technically, if there is no contact between the visual object and eyes, there is no eye consciousness. Ananda knows he can't see because he notes, in mind consciousness, the absence of eye consciousness impinging on mind consciousness. That is itself a function of mind consciousness - mind consciousness takes as its object both consciousness of the 5 sense organs as well as the previous instances of mind consciousness.

Are there morning and evening services like in Chinese-influenced Buddhism? Is the prātimokṣa chanted at one point? Where would I be able to find translated liturgy books, with the obvious caveat in mind that I'm not looking for juicy secret teachings and forbidden things from "beyond the veil?" I imagine some sort of monastic chant would be to-do with the vinaya. Do they chant excerpts from the Vinayasutra instead?

Malcolm wrote:
Monastics, in Tibetan Buddhism, only recite prātimokṣa on Posada days.

However, there are many daily prayers they might do, depending on the monastery. Typically a Sakya monastery day begins with puja to Tārā, which will included a daily recital that reaffirms both prātimokṣa and bodhisattva vows. The Triskandha Sūtra is a common recitation, for example. And since most monastics are Vajrayāna practitioners, their sādhana recitations will take care of maintaining their vows. But it really depends on school to school and monastery to monastery.

Definition of theist
: a believer in theism : a person who believes in the existence of a god or gods
specifically : one who believes in the existence of one God viewed as the creative source of the human race
Not surprisingly, both scientific skeptics and theists whose ideas of God center primarily on the notion of "intelligent design" have found Darwinian ideas religiously incoherent.

atheism

[/quote]


athe·​ist | \ ˈā-thē-ist  \
Definition of atheist
: a person who does not believe in the existence of a god or any gods : one who subscribes to or advocates atheism

While some argue against defining Buddhadharma as atheist, Muslims, Christians, theists in general understand Buddhadharma as an atheist tradition. For Buddhadharma, devas are just sentient beings who, when they exhaust their merit, fall into lower realms, nothing special at all. We believe in devas with about the same fervor as we believe in leprechauns, kobolds, elves, and fairies.

Many modern atheists have abandoned these definitions as they are very untenable philosophically. So instead of denying, they know "lack a belief." The second, however, is largely panned as centering on more modern, Westernized notions.

SilenceMonkey said:
Why can't everyone just acknowledge that there are two definitions to the word atheism?

1) Disbelief in the existence of God or Gods.
2) Disbelief in the notion of a creator God.

It's just a matter of preference for one or the other definition for the word.

Frankly, I have more in common with secular humanists than Christians, etc. YMMV. I am not worried about the former trying to slaughter me for my idiosyncratic beliefs; history shows the latter are dangerous to people like us.

I never said you have to be an atheist. I said I was one, still am, and will always be one, and that I understand the Buddha was also an atheist.

As an atheist, I do not believe that any version of theism—whether poly, pan, or mono—leads to liberation. I go for refuge to the Three Jewels. Whether there are mundane gods or not (not to mention the existence of a supreme being) is quite irrelevant.

Buddhism in atheist because we eschew refuge in all versions of theism, no matter what adjective one places before it.

That's quite a stretch, especially since your quote says Epicurus denied the charge.

On the other hand, everyone understood Lucretius to be an atheist. The polite term for godless atheist in the 18th century was “deist,”

No one said the Buddha was considered an atheist by the Brahmins in ancient India, rather the charge that Buddhism itself is atheistic and profoundly so.

Malcolm wrote:
Buddha was clearly an atheist since he rejected the idea that there was a supreme being.

Matt J said:
And consider this a non-affirming negation: by denying atheism, this does not mean Buddhism is some sort of W.Y. Evans-Wentz theosophy. I just don't think the clean conceptual categories really work here.

Malcolm wrote:
Either Buddha affirmed creation by a supreme being or he didn’t. If he didn’t, that satisfies the definition of being an atheist.

Matt J said:
Let's consider some comments, and ask if they would be acceptable to an atheist:
But we must be careful here! Because to say mind is open like space is not to reduce it to something nonexistent in the sense of being nonfunctional. Like space, pure mind cannot be located, but it is omnipresent and all-penetrating; it embraces and pervades all things. Moreover, it is beyond change, and its open nature is indestructible and atemporal.

Kalu Rinpoche, Luminous Mind, p. 49-50.

Malcolm wrote:
Not an affirmation of creation of the world by a supreme being, so irrelevant, and further, the translation is suspect. “All things” is “chos thams cad,” which does not refer to everything in the universe, but is a technical term which includes all phenomena of an individual in one aggregate, one sense base, and one sense element. So of course mind pervades all of these things.

Matt J said:
At the outset, let me state that Buddhism is not atheistic as the term is ordinarily understood. It has certainly a God, the highest reality and truth, through which and in which this universe exists. However, the followers of Buddhism usually avoid the term God, for it savors so much of Christianity, whose spirit is not always exactly in accord with the Buddhist interpretation of religious experience. Again, Buddhism is not pantheistic in the sense that it identifies the universe with God. On the other hand, the Buddhist God is absolute and transcendent; this world, being merely its manifestation, is necessarily fragmental and imperfect. To define more exactly the Buddhist notion of the highest being, it may be convenient to borrow the term very happily coined by a modern German scholar, "panentheism," according to which God is πᾶν καὶ ἕν (all and one) and more than the totality of existence.

Let's not even talk about those Indonesians, who were forced to modify Buddhism to conform to Indonesian politics. Shall we eject them from the tent?:
Sanghyang Adi Buddha is the origin of everything in the universe, but he himself is without beginning or end, self-originating, infinite, omnipotent, unconditioned, absolute, omnipresent, almighty, incomparable, and immortal. However, those words are unable to describe the true self of Sanghyang Adi Buddha. The existence of Adi Buddha demonstrates that this life is not the product of chaos, but the product of spiritual hierarchy. By the presence of Adi Buddha, this life becomes useful and be possible to attain enlightenment and Buddhahood.

And here is a literal (Tibetan, not Pureland) prayer to a Amitabha to go to Sukhavati:

To you I pray: inspire me with your blessing.

Guide me, I pray, to the realm of Sukhāvatī!

Certainly, the atheist convention would ride us out of town if they learned of this from ChNNR, which is not far from what I said before about the divine qualities being located in us instead of in an external God:
Most Westerners receive a Christian education and in the Christian tradition God is very diffused. God is recognized as something outside. They don’t know that God is in our real nature. If you have that knowledge and you are reading the bible, you can see there are many words that indicate God means our real nature. But then it developed in a more dualistic way. When they started to say, “the unique God governing all universe”, then it became easy to think God is governing everything. But it does not correspond in the real condition. So it is very important when you follow the Dzogchen Teachings, that you really understand what God means. It is not necessary to wonder if God exists or not. Some people are worried there is no God in Buddhism. In Buddhism there are so many kinds of gods, but Buddhists do not speak of the unique God. The essence of Buddhist teaching is Dzogchen, which is the final teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni. Through Dzogchen we can really understand what God is and we don’t have to worry if there is a God or not. God always exists as our real nature, the base, for everybody.

People are making the same mistake as the materialists, in my mind. Just because you amass a certain number of subjective impressions does not mean that at some point, as if by magic, objectivity leaps to the stage. Nor does adopting a set of inferences that have predictive value indicate the ontological truth of those inferences--- just because something is useful does not make it true. And indeed, inferences are always subject to falsification in any instance. 100 instances of smoke leading to fire doesn't mean it will do so on the 101st (for example, dry ice "smokes," as does smouldering peat or an ember.)

Nor does this skepticism amount to a denial of some kind of physical or external reality.By definition, everything we know is subjective. Shades of color aren't hanging out there, they are generated by sentient beings. With no observers, there is simply no qualia: no color, no sound, no texture. These are not only specific to the environment, they also vary from observer to observer (i.e. a color blind person may see no red). Those are all subjective qualities. If you don't accept that, explain how the motion of light relates to different colors, or how the vibration of molecules relates to the sounds we hear. It doesn't even make sense-- the redness of red is due to how light moves?

It is a tautology. However, because we have been conditioned into naive realism (i.e. things exist as we see them), we think this is not the case. If you wish to posit a colorless, soundless, textureless, non-experienced (because all of these are subjective) external reality, then by all means do so, although I don't know what you are positing.
