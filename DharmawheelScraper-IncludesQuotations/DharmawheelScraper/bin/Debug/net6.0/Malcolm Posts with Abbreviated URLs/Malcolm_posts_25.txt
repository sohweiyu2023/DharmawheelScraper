Pratimokṣa precepts are flexible: one can be a one-vow holder, a two-vow holder, etc., up to a full upāsaka/upāsikā. Simply put, one does not have to follow the vow against sexual misconduct if one does not feel one can. Or one can elect to so for a day, a week, a month. There is nothing "Western" about this flexibility, it is stated very precisely by Vasubandhu in the Abhidharmakośa.

Furthermore, everyone admits that the codes of Vinaya and rites of ordination were developed after the Buddha passed. This why there is considerable variation in Vinaya codes and the rites of ordination in different schools.

Malcolm wrote:
Since he died in 1925, it would be hard to claim that. However, Anthroposophy is basically racist:

Danny said:
By chance, as it were, the root race which happened to be paramount at the time Steiner made these momentous discoveries was the Aryan race, a term which anthroposophists use to this day.  All racial categories are arbitrary social constructs, but the notion of an Aryan race is an especially preposterous invention.  A favorite of reactionaries in the early years of the twentieth century, the Aryan concept was based on a conflation of linguistic and biological terminology backed up by spurious “research.”  In other words, it was an amalgamation of errors which served to provide a pseudo-scientific veneer to racist fantasies.

Anthroposophy’s promotion of this ridiculous doctrine is disturbing enough.  But it is compounded by Steiner’s further claim that—in yet another remarkable coincidence—the most advanced group within the Aryan root race is currently the nordic-germanic sub-race or people.  Above all, anthroposophy’s conception of spiritual development is inextricable from its evolutionary narrative of racial decline and racial advance: a select few enlightened members evolve into a new “race” while their spiritually inferior neighbors degenerate.  Anthroposophy is thus structured around a hierarchy of biological and psychological as well as “spiritual” capacities and characteristics, all of them correlated to race. The affinities with Nazi discourse are unmistakable.

Steiner did not shy away from describing the fate of those left behind by the forward march of racial and spiritual progress.  He taught that these unfortunates would “degenerate” and eventually die out.  Like his teacher Madame Blavatsky, Steiner rejected the notion that Native Americans, for example, were nearly exterminated by the actions of European settlers.  Instead he held that Indians were “dying out of their own nature.” 11

Steiner also taught that “lower races” of humans are closer to animals than to “higher races” of humans.  Aboriginal peoples, according to anthroposophy, are descended from the already “degenerate” remnants of the third root race, the Lemurians, and are devolving into apes.  Steiner referred to them as “stunted men, whose descendants still inhabit certain parts of the earth today as so-called savage tribes.”12

The fourth root race which emerged between the Lemurians and the Aryans were the inhabitants of the lost continent of Atlantis, the existence of which anthroposophists take as literal fact.  Direct descendants of the Atlanteans include the Japanese, Mongolians, and Eskimos.  Steiner also believed that each people or Volk has its own “etheric aura” which corresponds to its geographic homeland, as well as its own “Volksgeist” or national spirit, an archangel that provides spiritual leadership to its respective people.

Steiner propagated a host of racist myths about “negroes.”  He taught that black people are sensual, instinct-driven, primitive creatures, ruled by their brainstem.  He denounced the immigration of blacks to Europe as “terrible” and “brutal” and decried its effects on “blood and race.”  He warned that white women shouldn’t read “negro novels” during pregnancy, otherwise they’d have “mulatto children.”  In 1922 he declared, “The negro race does not belong in Europe, and the fact that this race is now playing such a large role in Europe is of course nothing but a nuisance.” 13

But the worst insult, from an anthroposophical point of view, is Steiner’s dictum that people of color can’t develop spiritually on their own; they must either be “educated” by whites or reincarnated in white skin.  Europeans, in contrast, are the most highly developed humans.  Indeed “Europe has always been the origin of all human development.”  For Steiner and for anthroposophy, there is no doubt that “whites are the ones who develop humanity in themselves. [ . . . ] The white race is the race of the future, the spiritually creative race.” 14

That's a pretty silly argument. Dharma is dharma. We in the US have what is known as the establishment clause, which guarantees separation of church and state. HH Dalai Lama agrees:

“The religious institution, the leader of the religious, and the political leadership, should be separate,”
-- July, 2011.

"What we need today is an approach to ethics which makes no recourse to religion and can be equally acceptable to those with faith and those without: a secular ethics."

"But the reality of the world today is that grounding ethics in religion is no longer adequate. This is why I believe the time has come to find a way of thinking about spirituality and ethics that is beyond religion."

-- Beyond Religion, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

Buddhists in the United States who have liberal values agree that with HH Dalai Lama on all these points. Karma is personal, and what I do with my female partner in my bedroom is no one's business by ours. The rage expressed by some uptight Buddhists over various sex acts and sexual orientations is very hysterical and wrong-headed. Homosexuality is quite widespread among monastics, even though, supposedly one is not supposed to be permitted ordination if one is a pandaka (which includes heterosexual voyeurs, incidentally). Pedophilia is also a large problem among monastics, a crisis which is not very evident here in the West, since we do not have the habit if sending five year olds to live in cloistered male communities. But it is something that more honest Tibetans, such as the late Chogyal Namkhai Norbu have been quite honest about. In pre-1959 monastic establishments, boys were considered fair game by sexual predators in Buddhist monasteries. Today, in Bhutan, there is a percentage of monks and nuns infected with STD's, including a 12 year-old boy infected with HIV.

Unknown said:
Health officials in the tiny Buddhist kingdom of Bhutan are making condoms available at all monastic schools in a bid to stem the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and HIV among young monks who are supposed to be celibate.

Then of course, there is the famous story of Dudjom RInpoche, who when asked about homosexuality, is said to have responded, "A hole is a hole." Since the man who asked the question is someone I know, I see no reason to doubt the answer.

What is interesting here, is that whenever we talk about how Buddhism is "conservative," in the end it boils down to differing cultural attitudes towards sexual orientation and abortion, and almost nothing to do with core Buddhist values: selflessness, emptiness, dependent origination, compassion, kindness, and bodhicitta.

I have no interest in modifying Buddhism to suit my political views (which are very liberal). I would however strenuously oppose instituting Buddhism as a state religion, since as we see in Burma, Shri Lanka, Tibet, Thailand, etc., Buddhism is completely corrupted by politics, always.

You will object that fossil fuels received far more in subsidies, and it is true. The same article states:

Kim O'Hara said:
The US Energy Information Administration reports that 28 percent of electricity generation globally in 2018 was from renewable energy and will only reach 49 percent by 2050. That’s disturbing given the planet’s need to cut back on carbon dioxide emissions and international targets that call for net zero emissions by 2050.

Given the sluggish adoption, some degree of subsidization will be needed for the foreseeable future. After all, the International Monetary Fund estimates direct and indirect subsidies to the global fossil fuel industry in 2017 totaled $5.2 trillion, up from $4.7 trillion in 2015, despite the climate crisis.

While renewables have proven they generate cheap electricity, the financial risks of some of these projects have not yet been fully mitigated. Renewable power generation is moving into a new phase, and while it is no longer crawling, it isn’t running yet either.

The EIA, which produces LCOE figures for future years, estimated in February that for wind facilities coming online in 2021, the average cost without subsidies would be $48.80/MWh when weighting by capacity. That’s compared with $46.70 for conventional natural gas and $40.50 for advanced natural gas (see Table A1a).

There are areas of the country, however, where wind’s LCOE values are lower or almost identical to those of advanced natural gas. Advanced natural gas, EIA analyst Sukunta Manussawee explained over email, is the only type of natural gas plant the agency expects to be built in the future, and refers to more efficient plants that get more energy from a given amount of fuel.

Overall, then, the data suggest that based on LCOE, building a new onshore wind facility is already, or very soon will be, cheaper than building a new natural gas plant, either on average, or in large sections of the country, without federal dollars being thrown wind’s way.

That isn’t the case for offshore wind, which remains very expensive to build, and thus is more pricey per megawatt hour than most other sources, even after subsidies are included (see, for example Table 1a or Lazard’s unsubsidized estimate of $92/MWh). There is only one commercial offshore wind farm currently operating in the U.S.

Beyond Levelized Cost

While LCOE is the most frequently used metric for cost competitiveness, it’s not perfect.

The EIA in particular cautions against reading too much into LCOE. “LCOE does not capture all of the factors that contribute to actual investment decisions, making the direct comparison of LCOE across technologies problematic and misleading as a method to assess the economic competitiveness of various generation alternatives,” the agency’s February 2019 report reads.

In other words, subsidies make wind, etc, very competitive with gas. The article concludes:

Kim O'Hara said:
In the end, only time will tell whether wind is viable without subsidies. As Namovicz emphasized in a phone interview, despite all the numbers and fancy analytics that people try to use, because the U.S. is currently providing a large subsidy to wind, it’s impossible to know the alternative.

“There are no facts without the subsidy, because we don’t have that data available,” he said. “Everything else is just analysis and economic modeling.”

It’s a sentiment that Murray, the Duke economist, also shared. “Basically the tax credit played its role,” he said in an email. “That is how subsidies are supposed to work — kick start a technology and see if it can compete. Looks like we will see.”

Kim O'Hara said:
More generally and in the longer term, all renewables need to do is undercut fossil fuel costs and the fossil fuel producers will go broke, one sector at a time.
Tar sand oil is more vulnerable than most, but coal-fired power stations are already on their way out: new wind and solar is cheaper (most places) than new coal, even when you factor in storage, and new wind and solar is cheaper in some places than the cost of simply running existing coal plants. That's all good, from my POV, and it will keep getting better.

Your larger claim, Nemo, that renewables are never going to be enough, is dubious.
On the supply side, costs are still falling, grids are getting smarter, and storage costs (the next big growth area, I reckon) are dropping. We're still working out the best transport energy solutions, although EV's are looking more and more likely to win that one.
But the demand side is where things might get really interesting. It's possible for us to reduce demand per capita without much of a reduction in comfort and convenience, and I would like to think that's where we might be going. It's also possible that our population will take a bigger-than-coronavirus hit from the next pandemic, or start dropping as the developing nations' fertility rates follow ours below replacement rate.


It's not all doom-and-gloom.

It remains uncompetitive in the market, and only exists through subsidies.

Disruption, Reuters explains, could result in permanent damage, which would translate into a permanent loss of production.

In my sangha, it was always interesting to hear my guru address those that associated Dzogchen as a 'shortcut'', as though there was no need to spend so much time with the generation/completion stage practices. Perhaps this is the case? Of course as we all know there are so many different paths based on the predispositions and abilities of practitioners.

What Would Happen If Everyone Truly Believed Everything Is One?
https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/be ... iGQoJAXk34

The actual study is behind a pay wall, but basically, if you believe everything is really one, you tend to be a better (morally/ethically speaking, IMO) person.

They made up a scale to determine how much a person believes in one-ness:
1. Beyond surface appearances, everything is fundamentally one.
2. Although many seemingly separate things exist, they all are part of the same whole.
3. At the most basic level of reality, everything is one.
4. The separation among individual things is an illusion; in reality everything is one.
5. Everything is composed of the same basic substance, whether one thinks of it as spirit, consciousness, quantum processes, or whatever.
6. The same basic essence permeates everything that exists.
As I read those, I wondered which one accorded with a Mahayana view. I don't think any of those accords with Emptiness/Dependent Origination...

It's a diet designed to aid meditators by cultivating more sattva quality. Ayurveda is more medicinal, and looks at an individual's constitution and tries to correct imbalances. It's more focused on an individual's needs.

Speaking as someone who has trained extensively in Tibetan Medicine and Ayurveda, one has to be very careful with sattvic diets. Most people cannot do a pure sattvic diet, because in many cases it will lead to vatta aggravation. Also recall, that milk, ghee, honey, and so on, are also part of a sattvic diet. Many people try to a vegan version of this and really damage their health. Seen it with my own eyes, more than once.

It seems my question was not clear.

I am aware there are existing English translations of the texts I mentioned, but there seems some debate as to the accuracy of the translations. From forums here and elsewhere I have read that new translations are being prepared for some of these texts and I assume this is because previous translations lack something necessary for students to comprehend the texts and benefit fully from them. If this is not the case, then why are new translations being prepared?

Perhaps this is the wrong forum to pursue this question, but as an English speaker only, this is of interest to me.

When I first began to read Buddhist sutras in English the translations I read were almost incomprehensible to me. They had been made by asian translators I believe and presented great difficulties for an English reader. I am aware of the value of a good translator, who fully comprehends the western mind and use of language.

Malcolm wrote:
As a well-published translator of Great Perfection material (five books), I can be quite frank about the fact that we are in the infancy of translating these texts. We all try to do our best, and and we all realize there is a long way to go. We all try no to be too harsh with each other, because we are all in the same boat.

There are three important factors to look for in a Great Perfection translation, which is very hard to evaluate for those who do not know Tibetan: is the translator's Tibetan grammar solid? Have the translations been peer reviewed? In general, one is not going to find peer-reviewed translations that are self-published on Amazon and elsewhere. Finally, does the translator have practical experience as well as the necessary Buddhist training both within the Great Perfection tradition itself and general Buddhist philosophy? Who are their teachers? What transmission have they received?

All of the texts we are translating now will have to be translated again 50 years. But for now, we do our best, because we are trying to help people attain buddhahood, not make a living off of book sales (if that was the goal, we would have all starved to death long ago).

Actually it does, hence the instruction "even if you heard a single line of verse..." In the Tibetan traditions at least, when you receive the oral transmission of a sutra, commentary or even a single mantra from someone then that person should be considered your teacher.

In the early monastic communities, one of the primary roles of your acarya was to teach you sutra recitation and memorisation.

PeterC said:
Just to expand on that.  It was rarely the case in early monastic communities that you could go into a library, pick up a sutra and read it. First you would have to actually *be* in the library, and since libraries were rare and important things, that didn't happen for casual visitors. Second, if you came across a sutra you didn't know, you would not just request to read it or copy it, you would ask for it to be explained. The biographies of the Chinese pilgrims to India described this process - and indeed they have descriptions of the translation process which show that commentary was being shared in that process too (this is perhaps intuitively obvious - how else would you make a half-decent translation). Of course it's possible that a monk could come across a text that had been forgotten and read it de novo, but that person wouldn't be a complete newcomer with no knowledge of the Dharma, they would be someone who had enough knowledge to even be in the library looking for documents in the first place. The ability to obtain a text and read it without any accompanying explanation is a very modern thing. The question of whether that's a valid way to learn the Dharma wouldn't even have occurred to most people a generation ago, because why would you do that if you were able to get an explanation from someone?

Pratyekabuddhas are those, who, under the tutelage of a samyaksambuddha, aspire to awaken as pratyekabuddhas in a time when there is no dispensation of a samyaksambuddha.

In other words, in order to become a prayekabuddha, one must generate the bodhicitta of a pratyekabuddha. That means first one must have understood what a pratyekabuddha is, and that will only be understood at the feet of the teacher.

tkp67 said:
That is not what the sutta says. The sutta states "when Buddhas have not yet appeared"

At the time when Buddhas have not yet appeared This place is a noble and sacred dwelling, For Paccekabuddhas who have awakened on their own

Recall my question, "did the pratyekabuddha require a living human teacher?" That is in context to the very existence in which they achieved liberation.

Malcolm wrote:
In order to become a śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, or a samyaksambuddha, one must first generate the bodhicitta of a śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, or a samyaksambuddha. In order to generate that bodhicitta, one must have a teacher under whom one generates that bodhicitta. For example, Śākyamuni generated the bodhicitta to become a buddha under Dipamkāra Buddha. Prayekabuddhas are not like mushrooms that spring up in a field after a thunder storm, without any apparent cause.

For example, the Subāhuparipṛcchā sūtra states:

"The vehicle of those of medium devotion, of medium capacity, who enjoy solitude, who err on the side of personal benefit, who are diligent in concentration and equipoise, and aspire to their own awakening is called the pratyekabuddhayāna...adherents of the pratyekabuddhayāna are dedicated to perfecting the pratyekabuddhayāna now and in the future."

The Daśacakrakṣitigarbha sūtra states:

Because the tathāgata is compassionate, sometimes he explains the dharma of the śrāvakayāna, sometimes he explains the dharma of the pratyekabuddhayāna, sometimes he explains the dharma of the unsurpassed yāna, and therefore, by the power of aspiration and by the power of the kalyānamitra, all misdeeds that are a result of negative actions are purified, and some obtain the result of the śrāvakayāna, some obtain nirvana through the pratyekabuddhayāna, and some realize the meaning of the extremely vast, unsurpassed yāna.

So this should put to rest the question of whether or not pratekabuddhas have teachers, since they clearly do have teachers, here called  kalyānamitras.

These people are described as having weak faculties, following the Śrāvaka Dharma, utilizing the Śrāvaka Piṭaka, being set on their own liberation, and cultivating detachment in order to attain liberation.[3] While those in the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle (Skt. pratyekabuddhayānika) are portrayed as also utilizing the Śrāvaka Piṭaka, they are said to have medium faculties, to follow the Pratyekabuddha Dharma, and to be set on their own personal enlightenment.[3] Finally, those in the Mahāyāna (Skt. mahāyānika) are portrayed as utilizing the Bodhisattva Piṭaka, as having sharp faculties, following the Bodhisattva Dharma, and set on the perfection and liberation of all beings, and the attainment of complete enlightenment.[3]

So he is the founder of Buddhism in our time, but many other Supreme Nirmanakaya Buddhas have "founded" Buddhism in the past. I can find a citation if you want me to, but this is Buddhism 101.

The only issue here is that those are two quite different systems of astrology with different calculation based (solar vs lunar). I’ve never studied Tibetan astrology so don’t know how they are conformed.

Malcolm wrote:
Skar rtsi (stellar calculation) is derived from Kalacakra, and is principally concerned with calendrics, though instructions for horary charts exist, which are not too different from Jyotish and Ptolmeic charts.

'Byung rtsi (elemental calculation) by contrast, in Buddhist sourcesis credited to Mañjuśṛī and Kongtse Trulpey Gyalpo (considered to be identical with Confucius by some Tibetans) and was a terma system introduced in the 11th century. It is credited to Du har nag po, supposedly a Chinese mathematician/astromer who came to Tibetan from China during the imperial period, translated/revealed by an 11th century (?) Tibetan named Khams pa khra mo.

Elemental calculation involves calculating the cyclic relationships between the five phases, wood, fire, earth, metal, and water; the twelve animals; the eight parkhas; and the cycle of sme ba; otherwise known as the magic square of Saturn.

Though the origin of these ideas are nominally Chinese, their treatment in Tibet is distinctly Tibetan, and owes very little to Chinese narratives on the same subjects. For example, in Chinese sources on the cosmic tortoise, there is no description of a tortoise of the basis, which describes reality in terms familiar to anyone who has received Dzogchen teachings:

PeterC said:
"First, out of total nothingness there is the so called "primordially existing or abiding tortoise". And from this arose, or were produced, all the Buddhas of the three times and all the sentient beings of the three realms. The example for that is the void of space, and since the meaning is the dharmadhātu of Samantabhadra, it exists without any coalescence or separation in any of the three times. No head or tail can be seen here, no limbs are shown here, in terms of time, here it abides without abiding. Without grasping to any extremes -- Buddhas and sentient beings are in that; including the dharmakāya, the sambhogakāya, and the nirmanakāya, the emanations of the body, speech, mind, qualities and activities of the Victors, male, female, neuters, moving and resting and so on -- that superior one is called the "abiding tortoise."

I've had the great misfortune to look into this terrain, and I think there is a profound shift between the two. Blavatsky at least, reads (bizarrely) a whole bunch of texts, from Plato to Shankara, and claims that there is a universal truth through them all. So, with early Theosophy you could be a Hindu, Buddhist, Jew or anything else, and simply read your existing tradition through that lens. A mistake, yes, but one that has reference points in history/reality.

Bailey "channels" all of her material from some entity calling himself "the Tibetan" - and thereby invents an entirely new tradition which replaces all existing traditions, and which has no reference points outside of itself. It is epistemologically, far more dangerous.

Malcolm wrote:
You forget, HPB was in contact with "mahatmas," Masters Koot Humi and Morya, and their disciple Dwaj Khul, supposedly a Tibetan disciple of the former, who make their first appearance in the Mahatma Letters.

Recall, the Secret Doctrine was supposedly written by Koot Humi and Morya. The Mahatma letters were sent to Sinnet, who wrote "Esoteric Buddhism."

Dwaj Khul is Bailey's "Tibetan."

Interestingly enough, I dug up an article on Baily writtten by our very own Nicholas Weeks, who it turns out was a follower of Bailey and Leadbeater from 1970-1985, by his own account. http://blavatskyarchives.com/In_Theosop ... ispers.pdf.

However, you are right, there is a shift into genuine racism in Bailey that is largely absent in Blavatsky, apart from the general 19th century attitudes one might expect in books from that era.

I've always been taught that it is critical to hear a teaching that has come mouth to ear in an unbroken lineage back to the Buddha. The wisdom of the teacher doesn't matter so much as the conveyance of the teaching accurately.

Malcolm wrote:
I never said that Sino-Japanese Buddhism was devoid of the four seals.

What I said what was "any Buddhism that does not adhere to the three or four seals is not valid buddhadharma." For example, the Pudgalavādins, a Buddhist school that existed prior to the fall of the Gupta empire, and perhaps beyond, asserted the existence of an inexpressible self that was different than the aggregates, because they were unable to conceive rebirth in anything other than substantialist terms. They were roundly refuted on all sides. You can read about this in the Refutation of the Self composed by Vasubandhu.

The point is that your contention that what others are calling a "soul" is just what Buddhists call "consciousness" is not a valid assertion.

These kinds of theories exist in many forms, some of them belong to indigenous traditions where Buddhism has spread, such as the Tibetan cultural idea of bla; others are like the Chinese cultural idea of shen, hun, and po; kami in Japan, etc., some of them are a result of philosophical speculation, like the Upanishadic atman, the Christian soul, and so on. These concepts are virtually impossible to reconcile with buddhadharma, end of story, no matter who bitterly complains about my assertion out of misplaced grudges and resentments.

It seems that earlier Buddhist literatures were more focused on “how rebirth” but not on “what rebirth”. As long as there is ignorance and mental formation, there would be becoming, birth, and death.

However, there are the concepts of transference of consciousness in Hindu literature as well as Daoist literature (in their own way). Not only that they could do multiple emanations from same individual continuum, and they have the theory of different categories of emanation. Even there is transference into another conscious being (i.e. only willingly). But, it does not mean that they have to believe in Transmigration of the Self.

Even in the earlier Buddhist literature, Bodhisattva (i.e. for Sakyamuni) descended from Tusita heaven and entered into his mother womb with full awareness. What was it that descended and what it was that entered? It is up to the individual what theory he/she knows and what he/she believes.

Malcolm wrote:
While it may be up to each person to believe whatever they want, any Buddhism that does not adhere to the three or four seals is not valid buddhadharma. As for the answer to your question, nothing transferred from Tushita to Mayadevi’s womb. Serial continuity does not require any kind of transfer.

So it was something of a surprise to learn, in early February, that Peterson had spent eight days in a medically induced coma at an unnamed clinic in Russia. Peterson’s daughter Mikhaila, a 28-year-old food blogger, posted a brief but dramatic video claiming that she and her father had traveled to Russia in early January seeking an unorthodox treatment for his physical dependence on the drug clonazepam. Dependency goes against the core tenets of Peterson’s philosophical brand: stoicism, self-reliance, the power of the will over circumstance and environment. “No one gets away with anything, ever, so take responsibility for your own life,” he admonished in his bestselling self-help book 12 Rules for Life.

But then you're doing something that the living holders of that lineage would not consider to be right, and to my mind that is reason enough not to do it.

But, actually, this is a limited view, circumscribed by the gross sensibilities limited by material substance they are composed of. We abide as a continuum that is more than the material, and is more fundamentally a sort of momentum of karma. This is called "mind stream".

I'd like to riff a bit on this topic. What follows is my own conjecture:

I could imagine a viewpoint where the material aspect is connected to the spiritual aspect. In other words, our mental form is completely reliant on our physical form, but to take inter-connectedness further, maybe the physical aspect relies on the spiritual aspect as well in some way. In which case when the physical form ceases and disperses then possibly there is still a subtle consciousnesses, which continues to exist - albeit in a less highly organized, more dispersed manner. But which can re manifest in some way as a higher order being again in the future???

As your idea that consciousness depends on the material aggregate, this is completely wrong, it is the other way around. Without consciousness, the body begins to decay immediately.

So, the use of the mere word soul literally is misleading.
Therefore it is a good measure simply not to use it in order to minimize confusion.

tingdzin said:
Exactly my point. The Chinese words hun and po do NOT refer to EITHER a "soul" or a "self" in the Western sense, and there is an extensive academic literature discussing this matter; until one has familiarized oneself with this, it is unwise to comment on things that are outside one's ken.  The same is true of the Tibetan word La ( bla ), which has been discussed before here.

Malcolm wrote:
Then you should criticize the translation, rather than my objection to such ideas being represented as valid doctrines within Buddhadharma.

These ideas have nothing to do with Buddhadharma, they are foreign to it. The point is not making allowances for Chinese, Tibetan, etc.,  cultural ideas. The point is to clearly distinguish cultural ideas from core Buddhadharma.

Distinguishing Buddhadharma from Daoism, Confucism, etc. does not denigrate the latter. Pointing out that there is no holy ghost in Buddhadharma does not denigrate Trinitarian Christianity. Pointing out that there is no Allah in Buddhadharma does not denigrate Islam.

The hun is something that in Daoism, etc., was considered to leave the body at death. Whether one calls this a spirit or a soul does not matter much, since this idea is foreign in every way to Buddhadharma.

The Tibetan concept of bla (pronounced "la") is irrelevant here, which in any case receives very limited treatment in Tibetan Buddhism, apart from Tibetan Medicine, elemental calculation, and some Nyingmapa rites ( bla 'gugs, bla bslu ), which presumably have some Bon antecedents. Even so, the pre-Buddhist concept of bla is quite attenuated in Tibetan Buddhism, and is basically considered to be a support for srog, lifeforce, and a synonym of tshe, longevity.

Hello all, I have a question regarding a teaching by Master Hsuan Hua mentionimg that animals are stupid because their souls are only a fraction or so of a human’s and that in order to reborn as an human, multiple of these animal souls needed to be re-integrated. There was also the idea of an individual having multiple souls and that if souls were kidnapped the person becomes retarted. Can anyone help to interpret the meaning behind this teaching?

http://www.dharmasite.net/BuddhaRootFarm/

The Venerable Master Hua replied: "On the body of one single animal are a hundred thousand, in fact, several million little organisms. These organisms are fragments of what was once an animal. The soul of a human being at death may split up to become many animals. One person can become about ten animals. That's why animals are so stupid. The soul of an animal can split up and become, in its smallest division, an organism or plant. The feelings which plants have, then, are what separated from the animal's soul when it split up at death. Although the life force of a large number of plants may appear sizable, it is not as great as that of a single animal or a single mouthful of meat. Take, for example, rice: tens of billions of grains of rice do not contain as much life force as a single piece of meat. If you open your Five Eyes you can know this at a glance. If you haven't opened your eyes, no matter how one tries to explain it to you, you won't understand. No matter how it's explained, you won't believe it, because you haven't been a plant!

"Another example is the mosquitoes. The millions of mosquitoes on this mountain may be simply the soul of one person who has been transformed into all those bugs. It is not the case that a single human soul turns into a single mosquito. One person can turn into countless numbers of mosquitoes.

http://www.drbachinese.org/online_readi ... -ce-06.htm
This shadow is also called “ghost soul” (people have three souls and seven spiritual faculties). For instance, if someone was a horse in his previous life, there will be the shadow of a horse following him.

.
.
.

What’s so bad about being divided into pieces? If the soul becomes fragmented like that, it’s very difficult to make it whole again. Probably those people won’t regain a human body again for billions of eons. When their nature is split and their souls are incomplete, they become dull and insentient, like plants. When their inherent nature is scattered, it’s hard to become a sentient being again. Even if they became a sentient being, they might be a mosquito. But one human body can transform into 84,000 mosquitoes, and it’s not easy to get all those mosquitoes back into one being. Most of the time, mosquitoes are reborn as mosquitoes. So they bob up and down in the cycle of birth and death, not understanding how to turn away from the dust and unite with enlightenment, or how to renounce confusion and return to the proper. It’s said, “Once the human body is lost, it cannot be regained in ten thousand eons.” If you truly understand this principle, how could you not be afraid?


一九八一年二月五日開示

A talk given on February 5, 1981


http://www.chinabuddhismencyclopedia.co ... :_Volume_8

Venerable Master: Our three souls and seven spirits are like children. But they each have only one sense faculty, not many. Because they control our bodies, we are able to speak and perform actions. They are gathered together, and when your cultivation is accomplished, they become what is known as a Buddha in Buddhism or an immortal in Taoism. Some have only eyes and some have only ears, so they help each other. The child who has ears and can hear will help the one who can see. They are interconnected.

So when you achieve the interchangeable functioning of the six sense faculties, your ears will be able to eat and talk. There are many states such as these that you cannot even conceive of.

Disciple: Venerable Master, you mentioned that you had a young disciple who went to the heavens to play and was captured by a demon king. He cried, "What can I do? I can't come back!" Did some of his souls and spirits go there?

Venerable Master: Among his three souls and seven spirits, maybe only one went, or maybe two went, or maybe three or four went. It's not for sure. Once they got there, they aggregated together. They were not seven or three separate entities. Once they go out, they unite into one. That's how wonderful and mysterious it is. It's a mass of efficacious energy!

Disciple: Is it because of different levels of cultivation that some people can send out more spirits than others?

Venerable Master: It's better not to send spirits out. If they always go out to play, they risk being caught by the demons. When the souls and spirits are captured, one becomes dumb. Retarded people and people who are that way because their souls and spirits have been seized by demons. Souls are ghosts, but with some cultivation, they can become spirits, which are yang in nature. With more cultivation, they can become immortals. Cultivated to the ultimate, they become Buddhas. All these states of cultivation are achieved by the same individual soul.

Disciple: If a person is in a "vegetable," or comatose, state or has lost some of his three souls and seven spirits, although his physical body is still intact, will the spirits and souls which have left him become another person?

Venerable Master: They don't become another person; they simply go with the demons. That's why the person is sometimes lucid, but sometimes very muddled.

Disciple: What if a cultivator who has sent out some of his three souls and seven spirits encounters Buddhas or Bodhisattvas?

Venerable Master: If a person is truly cultivating, there will be dharma protectors invisibly surrounding him. I have met a lot of strange people who can send spirits out of their bodies. Since you haven't encountered such states, you wouldn't recognize or understand them. For instance, the experience of those who act as mediums in Taiwan is described in the fifty skandha-demon states.

Thanks,

SM

Still you're right, knowing that others don't understand impermanence and emptiness makes me more compassionate towards others.
The best way to generate bodhicitta is to understand that the reason sentient beings suffer is that they do not realize emptiness. Emptiness is emptiness. The emptiness of the mind is the same as the emptiness of things.

So, I was brought up a Nichiren Buddhist by my parents.

Hence, when people talk about the teachings of the Lotus Sutra, a lot of the time, I’m like ‘well duh!!’  For instance that everyone can attain Buddhahood, That we all possess Buddha Nature and that life is eternal.
This means I don’t really appreciate the Lotus teachings and how the pre-lotus teachings prepare us for the revelation of the Lotus.

So, in order to grasp the value of the Lotus I'd like to discuss how the earlier teachings prepare us for the Lotus. I’d suggest we frame this conversation within Tient’Tai’s five periods doctrine.
how does each period progresses from the previous. What is learned from each period, and finally, why the Lotus Sutra is ultimately superior to all the other sutra’s.

These list of the five periods are:
Flower garland/avatamsaka Period
Agama Period
Correct and Equal/Vaipulya Period
Wisdom/Prajna Period
The Lotus and Nirvana sutra Period

If anyone can suggest a better way of classing the sutra's then let's consider that.

I’d like it if we could discuss this in-depth, if you guys are willing to?

Malcolm wrote:
Mahāyāna Sutras, in Indian Buddhism, were grouped by subject matter, rather than by presumed time of teaching. There are three major groupings: Prajñāpāramita, Tathāgatagarbha, and Yogacāra. Then there are miscellaneous sūtras that do not clearly fall into this or that category such as the Bodhisattvapitika, the Samadhirāja, the Lotus, the Ratnakuta sūtras, and so on.

Zhiyi's historical grouping has no precedent in Indian literature, and certainly is not how Tibetan Buddhists divide the teachings: which are generally divided into the three turnings: the first (Hinayāna), second (Provisional Mahāyāna), and third (Definitive Mahāyāna), based on a single passage from the Yogacāra Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra. Depending upon school, the second and third are considered defintive, and there is much debate around which sūtras are included in which turning. Then of course there are the tantras, which have no place at all in Zhiyi's scheme.

So, frankly, it is hard to have a conversation about this because the historical assumptions which are common in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism are not shared with the Sino-Japanese Buddhism and vice versa.

For example, as far as I am concerned, the Prajñāpāramita sūtras are the most important Mahāyāna sūtras. Others in the Indo-Tibetan Buddhism tradition feel the Tathāgatagarbha and Yogacāra sūtras are the most important, and while they certainly agree the Prajñāpāramita sūtras are important, they feel their full import cannot be understood in absence of  the Tathāgatagarbha and Yogacāra sūtras. I on the other hand, being a Mādhyamika, regard Yogacāra sūtras as provisional, and Tathāgatagarbha sūtras as conditionally definitive, providing they are correctly interpreted, since their incorrect interpretation is nothing more that atmavāda.

No one really reads the Lotus Sūtra in Tibetan Buddhism, it is just not that important in our tradition because it does not contain any doctrines that cannot be found in other sūtras as well. In fact, because of the heterogeneous nature of sūtras in general, these three main streams of sūtras were codified into the five treatises of Maitreya, which alongside the study of Nagārjuna's collection of reasonings, became the dominant focus of scholastic studies from the 6th century onward in India and then in Tibet.

We see a recent reengagement with the sūtra tradition in the teachings of Dzongsar Khyentse and Khenpo Sodar and so on, but this is a sort of a modern rediscovery of sūtra literature by Tibetans, it is not the focus of the Tibetan Buddhist system, which focuses more attention on the exegesis of tantric scriptures such as the Guhyasamāja, and so on. Sūtras are there mainly to be ritually recited once or so a year for merit. They are not generally studied. Part of the reason for this is that the language sūtras are translated into tends to be archaic Tibetan, since most of the sūtras were translated during the imperial period (prior to 840 CE), whereas the treatises that form the basis of the study of scholastic Buddhism in Tibet were constantly revised and updated through the 14th century and the final compilation of the Tibetan canon by Buton Rinchen Drup.

So, this will be a hard to discussion to have, simply because the historical assumptions which are common in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism are not shared with the Sino-Japanese Buddhism and vice versa.

Hello dharma friends,

Contemplating impermanence and emptiness makes my attitude nihilistic and that destroys my love and compassion. For example why should we help others, when pain and suffering are impermanent? It's only a question of time until we become enlightened.
On the other hand when I contemplate my mother's kindness and do tonglen, then I'm more attached to others and naive. Just acting like a kind person without any wisdom. Maybe that's because my love and compassion aren't all-embracing yet. Please can you give me any advice? Is the right path balance between these two? Or is my understanding just incorrect?
Thank you so much

There is a legal dispute at the basis of this conflict which goes back your supreme court's decision 25 years ago, the Delgamuukw Case. The eight hereditary chiefs mentioned before maintain that the councils do not have the authority to give access to the Wet’suwet’en land, based upon the Delgamuukw Case:

Minobu said:
Hoping to avert a repeat of last year’s much-criticized police action, Chief Hagwilnegh (Ron Mitchell) of the Wet’suwet’en’s Small Frog clan offered the deputy commissioner a piece of advice: consult the Delgamuukw decision.

“Read that, before you give out your orders,” he recalled telling her.

Malcolm wrote:
Canada's position towards Wet’suwet’en and other first nations, like that of the US and its first nations, is racist:

Minobu said:
Mohawk policy analyst Russell Diabo, who was working with interior B.C. First Nations when the Delgamuukw decision came down, said the “continuities are clear” over the decades.

“The governments have shown their main aim remains keeping powerful business interests happy and containing the power of Aboriginal rights and title, rather than moving toward a respectful relationship.”

United Nations bodies have repeatedly criticized the Canadian government for trying to dress up old policies that have been rejected by First Nations.

The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights noted in 2006 it “remains concerned that the new approaches, namely the ‘modified rights model’ and the ‘non-assertion model,’ do not differ much from the extinguishment and surrender approach.”

Justin Trudeau’s government announced on Tuesday that it would nationalize the Kinder Morgan pipeline running from the tar sands of Alberta to the tidewater of British Columbia. It will fork over at least $4.5bn in Canadian taxpayers’ money for the right to own a 60-year-old pipe that springs leaks regularly, and for the right to push through a second pipeline on the same route – a proposal that has provoked strong opposition.

...........

Now it’s Trudeau who owns the razor wire, Trudeau who has to battle his own people. All in the name of pouring more carbon into the air, so he can make the oil companies back at the Alberta end of his pipe a little more money. We know now how history will remember Justin Trudeau: not as a dreamy progressive, but as one more pathetic employee of the richest, most reckless industry in the planet’s history.

The more mature texts he wrote concerning Yogacāra materials were an attempt to reconcile Yogacāra with standard Madhyamaka, in which he resorts to interpretations of phrases in such yogacāra texts as the Dharmadharmatāvibhaṅga in ways that are impossible in Sanskrit, such as substituting snang ba for rig pa in the term rnam par rig ( vijñāpti ). There is no Sanskrit equivalent for rnam par snang ba. Someone working with Sanskrit texts would never try this kind of linguistic sleight of hand. So Mipham's interpretation only works in Tibetan, not Sanskrit. Therefore, we can understand it is removed from the original source texts.

Khenpo Shenga's approach is more sound and conservative (though not as fun nor inventive) which is why he is the dominant influence in setting the curriculum for the Nyingma school in the early 20th century, and remains so up to this day.

Hsuan Tsang (602-664), the main importer of Yogacara into China, just gives straight Indian Yogacāra according to the Yogacāra masters. He never interpreted Yogacāra material the way Tibetans did.  He stuck to the Indian script very faithfully, since he was expert in Sanskrit. Hsuan Tsang, lived in the 7th century, and studied Yogacāra and other subjects at Nalanda for at least two years during his 17 year pilgramage to India. So you cannot really claim that he was removed by time and geography. Even today, Hsuan Tsang remains the dominant figure in Chinese Yogacara.

These kinds of things have a place, but one cannot rely on them at the expense of common sense. For example, during this corona virus many amulets are being distributed on line like this one:

We then designed 2 mathematical modeling approaches to infer the outbreak dynamics in Wuhan by using high-resolution domestic travel and infection data. Results show that the doubling time early in the epidemic in Wuhan was 2.3–3.3 days. Assuming a serial interval of 6–9 days, we calculated a median R0 value of 5.7 (95% CI 3.8–8.9). We further show that active surveillance, contact tracing, quarantine, and early strong social distancing efforts are needed to stop transmission of the virus.

R0 of 5.7 in Wuhan!

Unknown said:
We found R0 is likely to be 5.7 given our current state of knowledge, with a broad 95% CI (3.8–8.9). Among many factors, the lack of awareness of this new pathogen and the Lunar New Year travel and gathering in early and mid-January 2020 might or might not play a role in the high R0. A recent study based on structural analysis of the virus particles suggests SARS-CoV-2 has a much higher affinity to the receptor needed for cell entry than the 2003 SARS virus (21), providing a molecular basis for the high infectiousness of SARS-CoV-2.

That would have been a disaster and would have been anything but normalcy, and that consequence still looms if we lift the stay-home orders and try to go back to "normalcy".

https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=SKELL
Possible origins for the word include:

The 17th century English slang word skelder, a noun and verb which referred to a professional beggar, especially one who falsely pretended to be a wounded former soldier to gain sympathy; more generally, it could be used for a swindler or cheat. An early recorded use is by Ben Jonson, from his play Poetaster, written in 1601: 'An honest decayed commander, cannot skelder, cheat, nor be seene in a bawdie house.' In an older military connection, the term skelder seems to have been used in early Medieval England to mean 'shield-maker' (Old Norse 'skjoldur'?), the supposed derivation of the streetname Skeldergate in the city of York.
The Dutch schelm, a word meaning a villain or rogue.
The Latin scelus, meaning a wicked deed or wickedness.

The way it declined can be understood from the line of chronicles like the index. At that time, Gyerphung Chenpo Nangsher Lodpo...etc."

There is a problem with this text however, as it places Ligmincha as a contemporary of Trisong Deutsan, but this, as ChNN and other scholars have shown, is historically wrong. Ligmincha was in fact a contemporary of and assassinated by Srongtsan Gampo.

Birth in Buddhism - The Suffering Fetus and Female Freedom
Recent decades have seen a groundswell in the Buddhist world, a transnational agitation for better opportunities for Buddhist women. Many of the main players in the transnational nuns movement self-identify as feminists but other participants in this movement may not know or use the language of feminism. In fact, many ordained Buddhist women say they seek higher ordination so that they might be better Buddhist practitioners, not for the sake of gender equality.

Eschewing the backward projection of secular liberal feminist categories, this book describes the basic features of the Buddhist discourse of the female body, held more or less in common across sectarian lines, and still pertinent to ordained Buddhist women today. The textual focus of the study is an early-first-millennium Sanskrit Buddhist work, "Descent into the Womb scripture" or Garbhāvakrānti-sūtra. Drawing out the implications of this text, the author offers innovative arguments about the significance of childbirth and fertility in Buddhism, namely that birth is a master metaphor in Indian Buddhism; that Buddhist gender constructions are centrally shaped by Buddhist birth discourse; and that, by undermining the religious importance of female fertility, the Buddhist construction of an inauspicious, chronically impure, and disgusting femininity constituted a portal to a new, liberated, feminine life for Buddhist monastic women. Thus, this study of the Buddhist discourse of birth is also a genealogy of gender in middle period Indian Buddhism.

Offering a new critical perspective on the issues of gender, bodies and suffering, this book will be of interest to an interdisciplinary audience, including researchers in the field of Buddhism, South Asian history and religion, gender and religion, theory and method in the study of religion, and Buddhist medicine.
A sample of the content can be viewed here: https://www.amazon.com/Birth-Buddhism-S ... _jeb7LCcGk

A bit of an eye-opener maybe for people that believe that Buddhism is somehow free of political and social influence?

For some reason you seem obsessed with law.

I believe in the separation of church and state. I do not want to see Christian law, Sharia law, Jewish law, Hindu law, Mahayana law, or Vajrayana law. (Can you imagine a court case where a lama claims a “crazy wisdom” defense?)

However this website is not about political, cultural, or legal issues. Although those discussions are allowed the focus is on Buddhism. And as such it is appropriate to address an issue from a buddhist perspective here, and even prioritize the buddhist perspective over how secular affairs are managed.

Malcolm wrote:
Do you want to be able to tell Buddhist women what to do with their bodies or not? Do you respect that they may make choices that you might find "wrong?"

I don’t think it’s size. I think it’s level of awareness or intelligence.

Karmic consequence increases by awareness.

Malcolm wrote:
No, it is measured by four things; the object; the afflcition; the deed itself; and the resultant satisfaction. If there is no satisfaction in the deed, then the vipaka of the karma is considerably weaker, and may never ripen. See chapter 4 of the Abhidharmakośabhaṣyaṃ for a full detailing of karma and is results.

It is true that killing an animal of any kind is a nonvirtue, but that is not what the first root precept concerns: it only concerns killing human beings. If a lay person kills an ant, they have not broken the first precept, even though they have committed a nonvirtuous deed.

This is a common understanding, but there are a couple of texts in the bstan 'gyur by Sūnyaśṛī (upāsakasaṃvarāṣṭaka and its autocommentary) that do not completely support this. If you look at the paper by David Reugg I posted above, you will see the exceptions mentioned.

In short, some Indian Buddhists commonly accepted that feticide was only a homicide after a certain number of weeks, generally after the stage of six sense organs, and as long as 19 weeks, if one was following the Ayurvedic understanding of the periods of gestation.

For Vasubandhu, consciousness is included among the dravyas. In the Abhidharmakośabhaṣyaṃ model, yes, you must have a real sense object in order to have a sense impression and a sense consciousness.

For Nāgārjuna, however, causation is merely a convention, therefore Richard Hayes' objection does not hold. In other words, Mādhyamikas conventionally accept the notion that a sense consciousness will not arise in absence of the sense organ and sense object, but they do not accept that any of these things are substantially real or exist independently of one another.

Birth as one holding wrong views, as animals, pretas, and hell beings, 
as one without the teaching of the victor, or in a border country,
birth as a barbarian, as one stupid and dumb,
or birth as any of the long-lived gods
are the eight faults of lacking freedom.

The ten endowments are divided into five personal endowments, and five external endowments. The personal endowments are:

A human born in the central country, complete sense organs, 
not engaging in wrong livelihood, faith in the object.

The external endowments are:

The Buddha has arrived, he has taught the Dharma, 
the doctrine exists, there are followers of that,

In any case, one cannot advocate for the rights of cellular life. Cells are property and have no rights of their own.

Had you written "isn't championing women's rights in opposition to championing the right to respect life even on a cellular level the same as the converse?"

My answer would have been the same in all respects. You can champion the right to respect cellular life, but it is meaningless cause. What are you going to do, go out and hold up posters in front of drug companies and demand that they respect cellular life?

In short, restricting women's access to safe abortions is both short-sighted and lacking in compassion.

And as usual, a bunch of men are arguing over women's health issues. I think women pretty much have made up their respective minds in this score.

If this were true, Buddhists would need to stop using antibiotics, antivirals, and and antiamoebic drugs.

Thus, we don't have an obligation to respect life on a cellular level. Cells have no independent consciousness, and thus they do not suffer pain. As far as anyone knows, bacteria, viruses, and amoeba also are not sentient life.

Further, a monk developed the clairvoyance to see small creatures in the water, finer than the water filter monks are provided with to strain their drinking water. The monk had a problem because now he felt he could not drink water at all because he could perceive these lifeforms in his water, invisible to the naked eye. When he presented this problem to the Buddha, the Buddha advised him to stop looking so deeply.

So, this objection is quite irrelevant to the discussion of abortion.

As far as the right for a woman to choose, this is public health issue. A modern society needs to provide access to safe abortions. These are the stats:

tkp67 said:
Between 2010–2014, on average, 56 million induced (safe and unsafe) abortions occurred worldwide each year.

There were 35 induced abortions per 1000 women aged between 15–44 years.

25% of all pregnancies ended in an induced abortion.

The rate of abortions was higher in developing regions than in developed regions.

Around 25 million unsafe abortions were estimated to have taken place worldwide each year, almost all in developing countries (1).

Among these, 8 million were carried out in the least- safe or dangerous conditions.

Over half of all estimated unsafe abortions globally were in Asia.

3 out of 4 abortions that occurred in Africa and Latin America were unsafe.

The risk of dying from an unsafe abortion was the highest in Africa.

Each year between 4.7% – 13.2% of maternal deaths can be attributed to unsafe abortion (2).

Around 7 million women are admitted to hospitals every year in developing countries, as a result of unsafe abortion (3).

The annual cost of treating major complications from unsafe abortion is estimated at US$ 553 million (4).

Safe abortion must be provided or supported by a trained person using WHO recommended methods appropriate for the pregnancy duration.

Almost every abortion death and disability could be prevented through sexuality education, use of effective contraception, provision of safe, legal induced abortion, and timely care for complications

Well, you have to take into account that the whole debate about abortion comes from Christians who believe they only have one life, this one, after which the soul goes to heaven or hell.

They also believe in original sin; so, from their religious point of view, abortion is extremely serious.

Now, from our point of view, we believe in rebirth. If a being in the intermediate existence is conceived and aborted, this does not ruin that beings's chance at a human rebirth.

Also, as long as the abortion is performed prior to 19 weeks, the fetus will suffer no pain because, in Buddhist texts, it is stated that a fetus will only have operational sense organs from 19th week onward.

Stating that something is or is not permissible by a strict rule is not the Mahāyāna way. In Mahāyāna, motivation is more important than the action.

Those who support a woman's right to choose are not imposing beliefs on anyone, since any woman who believes abortion is wrong is free to choose not to have an abortion should they do not want one.

As far as paying for abortions. It is interesting you mention abortion, but not war.

The fact is, that your belief that abortion is wrong is only a belief, and it is not shared by others.

We do not pay taxes based on what personally believe. I don't like the fact that Christians get massive federal subsidies for their charter schools, but our taxes get spent on that too.

Basically, you are entitled to believe in whatever you like, but you are not entitled to force your religious beliefs on others. It is a violation of the establishment clause of the first amendment to do so.

Sorry, this just does not rate as a) corruption b) a scandal. It's what they call a nothing burger, grasping at straws.

Everyone gives the Bidens a hard time, but what about the McConnell-Chaos?

Fa Dao said:
President Trump’s transportation secretary, Elaine Chao, and her husband, Senator Mitch McConnell, are being accused of having profited from their commercial ties to Beijing. In 2004, the two had a net worth of about $3.1 million, according to public disclosures. Three years later, the range was $3.1 million to $12.7 million. The next year, their net worth rocketed to $7.3 million to $33.1 million.

What changed? In 2008, Ms. Chao’s father, James Chao, gave the couple a “gift” of $5 million to $25 million (politicians are required to report money in ranges, not exact amounts). Certainly, their wealth has continued to grow.

Mr. Chao’s generosity was made possible by the fortune he has amassed through his shipping company, Foremost Group, which has thrived in large part because of its close ties with the Chinese government. In late 1993, Mr. Chao and his son-in-law, Mr. McConnell, traveled to China as guests of the state-owned shipyard conglomerate and military contractor, China State Shipbuilding Corporation. There they met with an old classmate of Mr. Chao’s, the former Chinese president Jiang Zemin.

Mr. McConnell’s once hard-line condemnations of China softened in the years to follow. For example, as The New Republic has noted, Mr. McConnell went from telling University of Louisville students that America would never forget Tiananmen Square, in the late 1980s, to hosting the Chinese ambassador at the same school several years later, even as the ambassador publicly defended the regime’s suppression of the Falun Gong.

All along, the Chaos continued to gain influence. Mr. McConnell’s sister-in-law, Angela Chao, and James Chao sat on the board of the holding company for China State Shipbuilding. While Elaine Chao was secretary of labor under George W. Bush, Foremost Group ordered several enormous cargo ships from a subsidiary of China State Shipbuilding. Secretary Chao and her father also appeared in several tandem interviews with Chinese media, and in at least one, they sit in front of the Department of Transportation’s emblem and alongside images of a book written by Mr. Chao. Today, Angela Chao sits on the board of the Chinese government’s Bank of China.

Last month, the House Oversight and Reform Committee started an investigation into whether Secretary Chao has leveraged her government positions to benefit her family. But so far there is no investigation into Joe and Hunter Biden. Defenders claim there must first be proof that a law was broken to open an investigation. That’s exactly backward. Congress can and should conduct an inquiry to determine whether anything illegal occurred.

Nonsense.

In an interview with Reuters in September, former Ukraine prosecutor Yuriy Lutsenko said Hunter Biden’s position on the board when his father was vice-president raised no red flags. “From the point of view of Ukrainian law, (Hunter Biden) didn’t violate anything,” Lutsenko said.

https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hunt ... SKBN1WX1P7

In the sworn depositions of Marie Yovanovitch, the former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent, Lutsenko’s name appears two hundred and thirty times, nearly twice as often as Trump’s. Lutsenko, sometimes referred to simply as “the corrupt prosecutor general” of Ukraine, has been portrayed, hardly without reason, as an unscrupulous politician prone to telling lies to further his personal ambitions. As those closely following the news have learned, Lutsenko fed information to Giuliani, which Giuliani, Trump, and their allies spun to smear the reputations of the Bidens and of Yovanovitch, whom Trump fired in April. One of the House’s star witnesses told me, of Lutsenko, “I don’t think we’d be here if not for him.”

https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2019 ... mpeachment

There are a lot of things about Biden that people ought not admire, like his treatment of Anita Hill, his support for the 1996 crime bill, NAFTA, and so on, you can even toss in his cozy relationship with the credit card companies, but the Burisma thing is complete bollocks, no more valid (i.e. totally invalid) than the Benghazi smear against HRC.

I've seen scores of people NOT be healed from whatever ailed them, doing medicine buddha practice, doing practices recommended to them by their gurus. I've seen lamas get sick and die, trying all these same practices. All the while, many of those sutras explicitly stated IT WOULD heal them. So is everyone, including the lamas, practicing it incorrectly, or are the sutras just plain wrong?

I'm pretty sure everyone who has spent some significant time in a Tibetan Dharma center can attest that none of the health related tantric practices work for anything that placebo and time couldn't have reasonably fixed alone.

I think Donald Trump should be doing more to denounce hate crimes committed against Asian people during this crisis, but it's a problem that won't be solved by repeating talking points from the Chinese government.


Malcolm wrote:
The Spanish flu did not start in Spain. It was called "the Spanish flu" because the Spanish papers were the first to report it since Spain had not imposed wartime censorship as they were not involved in the WWI.

The reason Trump is calling it "The Chinese Virus" is to counter claims made by a member of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Zhao Lijian, that it had been brought to Wuhan during some military athletic competitions in Oct.

However, it is about as accurate as the English calling syphilis, "The French Pox," and just as rooted in xenophobia.

Your statement is false.

In Buddhism, abortion is only considered the taking of a human life after the 19th week. How do we know this? A bhikṣu etc., only commits parajika, a complete defeat, if he causes an abortion after the 19th week. Prior to that, causing an abortion is not considered killing a human being.

All of the arguments against abortion hinge on religious beliefs. Therefore, they violate the establishment clause of the first amendment.

The Maduro regime could not successfully navigate the sharp loss of oil revenues which began in 2014, etc. The Maduro gvt. then embarked on an antidemocratic path, supported by the Chavistas, and what we have now is the present situation.

There has been a lot of recommendations one sees in various places on line for what kinds of practices one should be doing during this time. Here is my list of essential practices. Most of these are concerned with pacifying the eight classes, In particular, these diseases are spread by Mamos.


Orgyen Menlha/Medicine Buddha-- best to do for people when they are ill.

Chod practice for those who are ill.

Preventative practices:

Riwo Sangchod-- this or any general rite of Sang is important for everyone to do during this time because these outbreaks are always a result of our general contamination and disrespect of the environment, as well as violation of our three vows. This practice is used to purify ourselves, and in this way, acts as a rite of repelling.

Wrathful pratices such as Takhyung Barwa, Guru Dragpgur, Dorje Drollo, Vajrapani, and so on, which are used to pacify and control the eight classes.

The Golden Libation for the Eight Classes by Nubchen (degyed serkhyem), again, used to appease local deities, etc.

Parnashavari is particularly effective in this time.

Dorje Gotrab, but one needs to do a three day silent retreat on this practice.

Tārā, especially the 20th Tārā mantra.

Reciting Barche Kunsel and Sampa Lhundrup.

For those who do not have Vajrayāna empowerment, reciting the Heart Sutra with the repelling rite is effective.

Obtain and wear a Nagpo Gujor pill. Consult your guru for how to use it best.

Wash your hands frequently, reciting the Seven Line prayer to Padmasambhava slowly while doing so = three happy birthdays.

Stay home and practice.

It seems people are panicking a little quieter here at the moment. The shelves are getting emptied out but then restocked. On Friday the Federal Council announced closures of all schools and tertiary institutions and border controls and I think that finally tilted the balance somewhat towards panic. But I was shopping just afterwards and while the trolleys were a bit fuller than usual, the people didn't seem overly frazzled. In the meantime, individual Cantons (States) introduce harsher measures such as closure of all non-essential shops. It feels like we are not too far from an all-out curfew.

I just saw that Germany has closed the Swiss border.

But in the meantime, I don't think people are taking social distancing all that seriously. Maybe beginning too now, even as it's been drummed into us for the past 3 weeks. Tomorrow we have a teachers' meeting in Bern to work out how this Distance Education thing is going to go. I teach at the largest Bernese gymnasium as well as at the Technical University of Bern, both of which will be closed for some time, I expect, though there is talk of exams being help under safe conditions.

But some good news:
Nepal has closed all of its Himalayan peaks, including Mount Everest this climbing season, because of fears of the coronavirus outbreak, a government minister said on Friday.

Nepal, home to eight of the world’s 14 highest mountains, including Mount Everest, gets more than four million dollars in permit fees for the world’s highest peak and other mountains every year.

Tourism Minister Yogesh Bhattarai said expeditions to all peaks in the March-May spring season had been suspended.

“Climbing this season has been closed,” Bhattarai told Reuters.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, this is good news. There is a prediction by Guru Rinpoche in the Konchog Chidu (Embodiment of All Jewels) that reads:

Taking life, deceptive trade practices, are each poisonous supports. Competing in skill at theft and plunder, teachers who take the life of virtue are made into one’s mother. “Father” is not heard by children, “master” is not heard by servants, “lord” is not heard by subjects. The wicked are in full bloom. Ornaments are made into weapons. Dharma activities shorten one’s life, but misdeeds raise one’s spirits. The temples fall into disrepair. Since the negative local spirits spread, there is much frost and hail. Mamos and ḍākinīs spread contagious diseases among children, adult diseases for adults, cattle diseases for cattle, and blights on harvests, etc., will appear suddenly like dust devils. Tree wither above the roots, families are destroyed by famine. Rats invade the land.

At that time, there are no Dharma activities, and since misdeeds increase, cause and result is ignored. Because of the power of the ten misdeeds, etc., the merit of Tibet sinks lower and lower. Pekar possess bhandhes, only a few men possess vows. Since demons and spirits possess mantra practitioners, commitments do not exist and illness increase. Since gyalpos possess men, they start civil wars. Since the sen mo possess women, they commit adultery, administer poisons and are deceptive. Since the'u rang possess children, they steal, have fevers, and are badly behaved. There are many madmen and rabid dogs. Since the food portions of sentient beings diminish, the essence of their elements is harmed. Efforts will be made to reach the top of the Himalayas and there will be farming on the mountains.

There has been a lot of recommendations one sees in various places on line for what kinds of practices one should be doing during this time. Here is my list of essential practices. Most of these are concerned with pacifying the eight classes, In particular, these diseases are spread by Mamos.


Orgyen Menlha/Medicine Buddha-- best to do for people when they are ill.

Chod practice for those who are ill.

Preventative practices:

Riwo Sangchod-- this or any general rite of Sang is important for everyone to do during this time because these outbreaks are always a result of our general contamination and disrespect of the environment, as well as violation of our three vows. This practice is used to purify ourselves, and in this way, acts as a rite of repelling.

Wrathful pratices such as Takhyung Barwa, Guru Dragpgur, Dorje Drollo, Vajrapani, and so on, which are used to pacify and control the eight classes.

The Golden Libation for the Eight Classes by Nubchen (degyed serkhyem), again, used to appease local deities, etc.

Parnashavari is particularly effective in this time.

Dorje Gotrab, but one needs to do a three day silent retreat on this practice.

Tārā, especially the 20th Tārā mantra.

Reciting Barche Kunsel and Sampa Lhundrup.

For those who do not have Vajrayāna empowerment, reciting the Heart Sutra with the repelling rite is effective.

Obtain and wear a Nagpo Gujor pill. Consult your guru for how to use it best.

Wash your hands frequently, reciting the Seven Line prayer to Padmasambhava slowly while doing so = three happy birthdays.

Stay home and practice.

Thanks, just fine so far.

tkp67 said:
I’m going to make very wide generalisation here but Tibettan Buddhist imported Indian Buddhism enmass in one short period so they have quite complete collection from that period of Indian Buddhism.

Malcolm wrote:
False. Buddhism first entered Tibet during the Mid-7th century, where it briefly flourished among the aristocracy. During the eight century, Me Agtsom (704-755) was married a Chinese princess, Jincheng (?-739), and she brought Chinese Buddhism with her in 710. She died in a smallpox epidemic, and that epidemic prompted an anti-Buddhist reprisal.

Next, the son of another wife of Me Agtsom assumed the throne in 755, Trisong Detsen (742-794). He was pro-Buddhist, and during the decade of 760, he invited teachers from both China and India, and the project of translating Buddhist texts began during his reign. Shortly before his death in 794, he chose Indian Buddhism as the de facto standard, and invited the Chinese Buddhist monks to leave Tibet. He passed in 794, and his sons took up the task of continuing the sponsorship of translation, etc.

During this period, in general, it was prohibited to translate any esoteric Buddhist texts apart from what we term "lower tantra," identical for the most part with the texts that support the esoteric Buddhism of Shingon and Tientai. To do so required royal permission. Some of these texts were translated, but their practice was restricted.

In 844, the Tibetan Empire collapsed with the assassination of King Langdarma, ostensibly due to his suppression of Buddhist monasteries, but more likely over the novel idea that they should be subject to taxation. This marked the end of the early translation period.

During the 970's, after the remnants of the Tibetan empire regrouped in West Tibet, the Buddhist Sangha was revived from remnants that had survived in Eastern Tibet, and once again, missions were sent forth to gather Buddhist teachings. This period of collecting and translating Buddhist texts lasted until the middle of the 15th century. However, the main lines of Tibetan Buddhist schools were firmly drawn in the 12th century.  So, this opinion above is not accurate. It took the Tibetan 5 centuries+ to consolidate their canon.

tkp67 said:
Chinese Buddhism, due to distance from India, imported Indian Buddhism in piecemeal fashion over a long period of time.

Malcolm wrote:
See above, this the same as in Tibet.

tkp67 said:
While Chinese Buddhism occasionally possess early version of sutra not found in Tibet, overall, its collection of sutra are disorganised and many of sutra provance being uncertain. In Chinese Buddhist theology, it is legitimate topic to debate if certain sutra is a forgery.

Malcolm wrote:
There are many debates in Tibet over which texts collected in the canon were forgeries and which were authentic. These debates continue to this day.

tkp67 said:
This create two distinct approach to theology. In Tibettan Buddhism, all available sutra are deemed authentic. Therefore, their theological approach is to synthesise these collection (like Gelug).

Malcolm wrote:
Not so. However, the fundamental criteria is whether or not a sūtra, tantra, or a treatise had a Sanskrit original.

tkp67 said:
Tantien/Tendai school is based on the founder’s theology which is to split Shyakamuni buddha’s life into 5 period, and his teaching into 8. I’m not expert to get into detail but basically, immediately after obtaining the enlightenment, Buddah taught his pure teaching (Avataṃsaka/Kegon sutra) to his students. However, he realised that his students are not being able to comprehend some higher aspect of enlightenment so, Buddha taught easy beginner’s version (Agama/Agon sutra) in early period while he taught supreme version in later period (Lotus/Hokke sutra), and also just before he dies and enter nirvana (Nirvana/Nehan sutra).

Malcolm wrote:
This scheme never entered Tibet, as far as I can tell, nor were Zhiyi's texts ever studied widely in Tibet, if at all. Ironically, following the Korean Yogacāra scholar Wongchuk, a direct disciple of Hsuan Tsang, Tibetans follow the scheme of the three turnings of the wheel.

tkp67 said:
Tantaric Buddhis emerged quite later in Indian Buddhism and consequently, it was brought into China as something of newly discovered Buddhism. Therefore, there is a great debate in China about its authenticity, while in Tibet, its authenticity is presumed from outset.


Malcolm wrote:
While it is true that the Tibetans did not question that authenticity of what is known in Tibet as yoga tantra (i.e. more or less the same texts that Shingon and Tendai use), there were many controversies about the interpretation of some of the texts that were translated into Tibetan during the early period, which we now know as highest yoga tantra, and these controversies became particularly pointed during the later translation period.

In NYC, Mayor has stated that he will fight "tooth and nail" to keep the public schools open.

The main reasons appear to be:
1. There are many children who would not be able to eat if school is canceled; many poor children rely on school lunches.
2. Without school, many parents who cannot afford it will be forced to take off work.

There are some ramifications that have been discussed - if children are out of school, they may end up with grandparents or other older people who are at greater risk if they are infected.

I have two small children and one aspect about them I accept is that they are little disease vectors - whatever is going around schools will get to the rest of our family. My parents are in good health but old - I'm most worried about them.

Even though my children's school is not suspended, I am wary about sending them.

Infection rates in Wuhan, in particular, and China, generally, seem to have peaked and are declining:
In China, where the epidemic began, the daily case numbers continue to drop. On Wednesday, just 24 new infections were reported, 10 of which involve people who had traveled abroad, suggesting a lower rate of community transmission, according to health authorities.

China's National Health Commission said six new cases had been reported in the capital, Beijing, but that five of them were patients who had traveled to Italy and the sixth to the U.S., according to the South China Morning Post.

The precipitous drop in new cases in China, where 80,778 cases have been diagnosed since the outbreak began in December, caused local officials to begin relaxing travel restrictions that were imposed in January, as the government struggled to contain the virus' spread.
https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandso ... f-epidemic

I think the predictions of tens of millions or hundreds of millions of deaths are wildly overstated.
Between 160 million and 214 million people in the U.S. could be infected over the course of the epidemic, according to one projection. That could last months or even over a year, with infections concentrated in shorter periods, staggered across time in different communities, experts said. As many as 200,000 to 1.7 million people could die.


And, the calculations based on the C.D.C.’s scenarios suggested, 2.4 million to 21 million people in the U.S. could require hospitalization, potentially crushing the nation’s medical system, which has only about 925,000 staffed hospital beds. Fewer than a tenth of those are for people who are critically ill.

Also, they do not perceive those sentient beings as selves in this lifetime, what need mention what is attained and who attains it? Śariputra, the bodhisattva mahasattva who practices the perfection of wisdom teaches the dharma to sentient beings with skillful means.

Here, for example, one can see the relationship between the two truths and the pair of method and wisdom laid out quite clearly.

Or take for example The Discourse of Vimalakīrti Sūtra:

The mother of bodhsattvas
is the perfection of wisdom,
their father is skillful means—
the guides born from those.
 
Their wives are the joy in dharma,
their daughters are love and compassion,
their sons are the dharma and the two truths,

The idea that postmodernism is simply Marxism by another name would surely surprise many on the Left who regard the two as inimical to one another. Postmodernism largely emerged as a reaction against the thoroughly modernist narrative underpinning Marxist theory. It is an aesthetic and philosophical rejection of the “grand narrative” claims of individuals like Marx, who believed that there was a “science of history” which could be discerned by acute dialectical materialists. Post-modernists in the vein of Foucault and Derrida problematize the idea that one can develop such objective “sciences” ...

But in terms of buddhological doctrine, the important points of the Lotus are not so much about upaya, because there are many sutras that address this, but rather, primordial buddhahood and ekayāna, because there are not so many sutras that address those two points.

Upaya comes from the actions of a bodhisattva who has clairvoyance and is capable of directly knowing (abhijñā) the minds of others, and what they need. So they talk and act in response to that. We, at least I, do not have direct knowledge of the minds of others, so our means are not so skillful.

Yes, it does. Buddhas talk, perform deeds, and they are omniscient. No third truth is needed to explain upaya, since all upaya is in the domain of relative truth.
Again, The Three Truths...pivots to address other things.

Now you are just contradicting yourself. No third truth is needed to address how the Buddha and ārya bodhisattvas act skillfully for the benefit of sentient beings. Buddhas have no need to benefit themselves, having realized the dharmakāya (ultimate truth). They manifest the rūpakāya (relative truth) to benefit others. No third truth is needed to explain this. There is nothing other for the Buddha to address other than benefitting oneself and benefiting others.

Meditation on Equanimity

The nine- round meditation is comprised of training the mind in equanimity with a mental outlook based on the dual nature of things and events: the conventional and the ultimate. Based on different perspectives, the first in turn is divided into two sections, one from the viewpoint of others and the second from the viewpoint of oneself.

Mortality for COVID-19 appears higher than for influenza, especially seasonal influenza. While the true mortality of COVID-19 will take some time to fully understand, the data we have so far indicate that the crude mortality ratio (the number of reported deaths divided by the reported cases) is between 3-4%, the infection mortality rate (the number of reported deaths divided by the number of infections) will be lower. For seasonal influenza, mortality is usually well below 0.1%. However, mortality is to a large extent determined by access to and quality of health car e.

We are looking at a situation in which Africa, large parts of S. America, SE Asia, India, etc., have inadequate health care systems for coping with pandemics. The Trump administration’s lack of preparation combined with Trump’s eliminating the NSC’s global pandemic response apparatus in 2018 could and probably will result in fatalities much higher than in China. Simply put, we do not have enough resources worldwide to a) stop the pandemic b) to treat the most severely ill.

Also Dr. Fauci explained to Congress today that covid-19 is ten time more fatal than the flu. Now the flu usually has a fatality rate of 0.1%. That makes the fatality rate for  covid-19 1%, but that’s just a guess. Assuming 1.4 billion people become ill, this still 14 million deaths worldwide.

4. Plan for hospitals to be overwhelmed, as happened in Wuhan, China, and in Iran and northern Italy. Epidemiological models suggest that by late April we could have millions of Americans infected, and the danger is that people with other ailments die for want of care in the chaos. Several epidemiologists suggest that we could easily see 100 million infections of the new coronavirus in the United States, of which 5 or 10 percent might require hospitalization and 1 percent might need a ventilator. That could mean almost one million people needing ventilators just for Covid-19, though not all at the same time, yet we have only about 72,000 full ventilators in the United States.

168M would be more than 2% of the global population. That’s up in Spanish Flu territory. But Spanish Flu was 10%-20% lethal. I guess that means the Spanish Flu did not have infection rates as high as these estimates.

So hopefully your estimates will be more accurate—or even too high. Only time will tell.

Personally I’d like to assume a 10% infection with less than 1% case fatality rate. But I don’t have a source for that.

Do you have a source for your figures? In particular 4% case fatality seems high with current data. (Of course current data is unreliable, so all these figures are meaningless.)

She's 10 years younger than me, and yet she's feeling this so much worse than a flu would be for her (pain in chest, difficulty breathing, etc.), and she may require hospitalization soon. Her boyfriend is also equally as sick, and he likely got infected by visitors from north Italy, before we knew about any sort of situation in Italy.

In Europe the virus is now exploding, and it likely will in the US as well, soon enough. I fear for those there who don't have proper insurance, who can't get healthcare, who don't have job security (cannot get paid sick leave, and so on). This is a very rough situation to be in.

Summary
The most important finding of this study is that COVID-19 strains form two well-supported clades (genotype I, or Type I, and Type II). Type II strains were likely evolved from Type I and are more prevalent than Type I among infected patients (68 Type II strains vs 29 Type I strains in total). Our results suggest the outbreak of type II COVID-19 likely occurred in the Huanan market, while the initial transmission of the type I virus to humans probably occurred at a different location in Wuhan. Second, by analyzing the three genomic sites distinguishing Type I and Type II strains, we found that the synonymous changes at two of the three sites confer higher protein translational efficiencies in Type II strains than in Type I strains, which might explain why Type II straints are more prevalent, implying that Type II is more contagious (transmissible) than Type I. These findings could be valuable for the current epidemic prevention and control. The timely sharing of our findings would benefit the public health officials in making policies, diagnosis and treatments.

Often, when one finds themes of concern to Tibetans, the very same themes are of no interest to OG Indian Buddhists. The same can be said of the Chinese.

For example, until the tantric period, 650 onward, Indian Buddhists expressed virtually no systematic interest in tathagatagarbha.

In the Lotus, Buddha explains upaya very much along these lines. He describes a father telling his children playing in a burning house that there are toy carts outside the house if they'll only come and get them. At the time the father says this, there are no carts outside the house. And so he's saying something that is technically false. And yet, his aim is to get the children out of the house, which his enticement does. But then, when the Buddha asks Shariputra, "Is the father lying?" Shariputra answers in the negative, and then the Buddha goes on to affirm his answer and explain that although the Buddha teaches three vehicles, there is in fact only one Buddhavehicle, and that actually, they're all the Buddhavehicle.

Malcolm wrote:
This does not apply.

Here is a text explaining the relationship between the ultimate and the relative that explicitly does not go so far as to declare what the Buddha says is false, even when it otherwise meets the definition of what people would generally say is false.

The Middle is sometimes called the Buddhanature Middle Truth to emphasize that the Three Truths is not just a restatement or clarification of Nagarjuna's Two Truths, but rather something else intimately related to the Buddha and his relationship with beings.

It is going to be confusing for someone coming from a strictly Madhyamika view to accept this. And what is there to say about that?

Well, highest yoga tantra has thirteen stages. Some schools interpret these merely adding two more stages to the bodhisattva path, other schools understand this as being actual stages of buddhahood. The locus classicus of the thirteen stages is the Samputa Tantra, which pretty explicitly states that buddhas of the eleventh and twelfth bhumi have slightly defective omniscience. In yoga tantra on down, buddhahood is the eleventh stage.

Malcolm wrote:
That is not a refutation, that is not even a consequence. For example, in order to show that I was mistaken, you would need to show that Nāgārjuna's intent was that emptiness, in that verse, intended ultimate truth; and that dependent designation intended relative truth (they don't). You cannot rely on a vague legal principle like "penumbra" to explain this away, that somehow this third truth was lurking there all along, just waiting to be discovered by Zhiyi, mystically concealed in the Lotus Sutra by the Buddha.

I have already provided scriptural citations flat out denying there is such a thing as third truth, etc., as well as citations which show how this verse intended to be understood. As far as I am concerned, the whole discussion is based on Chinese Buddhist misunderstandings of the intent of Nāgārjuna, misunderstandings that continue to this day because people refuse to study these things properly.

The Truth of Non-substantiality (Kutai)
The Truth of Temporary Existence (Ketai)
The Truth of the Middle Way (Chutai)
It is quite equivalent to Yogacara Theory. It is said that Yogacara had tried to harmonize the views of asti and nasti vadin. I do not know whether Zhiyi had studied Mahayanasutralamkara or not as there might be Paramartha’s translation at his time (i.e. probably). However, his description is equivalent to this verse: (34) When one has realized the vacuity of inexistence, and also vacuity of such and such existence, and has known the natural vacuity, one can say that one is the knower of the void.

Asanga, tr Surekha Vijaya Limaye, (2000), Mahayanasutralamkara, Sri Satguru Publications, Chapter XIV, p 272
Anyway, those, who are more familiar with Zhiyi, can cross check it.


Malcolm wrote:
Zhiyi would not have read the Sūtralāṃkāra, it was not translated into Chinese until 630.

And this is just a reference to to the three natures, the imputed, the dependent, and the perfected. What are these? The verse is, "Since the emptiness of the nonexistence is know, and likewise, since the emptiness of the existent and natural emptiness is known, one is called the knower of emptiness."  The first is the imagined, the second is the dependent (aka all-basis consciousness), and the third of the perfected (the absence of the imputed in the dependent).

Now. in Vasubandhu's commentary on Maitreya's verse (this text was not written by Asanga), he comments that the first emptiness is the imputed nature; the second is the dependent nature, and the third is the perfected nature. But again, this is a question of perception, and it is clarified more readily by the Madhyānatavibhańgakāriks̄:

The imagination of the unreal exists;
duality does not exist in it;
emptiness exists in this;
and the former exists in the latter.

Since everything is explained 
as not empty and not not-empty, 
since there is existence, since there is nonexistence, and since there is existence,
that is the middle way.

The first line of the first verse explicitly explains the appearances of the triple realm, that is, the imagination of the unreal (parikalpita), that is, the imagination of subject and object exists. However, that duality does not exist, and in fact, it is exists as the imagination of an unreal subject and object. The former, duality, exists in the latter, emptiness, which is to say duality exists in a consciousness that is empty of duality.

Now, here emptiness and the imagination of the unreal both exist (not empty), but they are empty of duality (not not-empty). The imagination of the unreal is all compounded phenomena, and emptiness is uncompounded, hence, this explains all phenomena. Therefore, the imagination of the unreal exists, duality does not exist, but that emptiness of that duality does exist; and since everything is not wholly empty and everything is also not wholly non-empty, that is the middle way as described by Maitreyanatha.

To say that not everything is wholly empty is to say that everything exists as a projection of a deluded consciousness; to say that everything is not wholly nonempty is to say that the projections of that deluded consciousness do not exist. This is Maitreyanatha'ss formula of the middle way.

This presentation is completely different than what Zhiyi is getting at. Zhiyi is trying to reconcile a substantialist misunderstanding of Madhyamaka that plagued earlier Chinese scholars, who mistook epistemology of the two truths for an ontology. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, Zhiyi never totally overcame this ontology, and still continued this misunderstanding, even as he tried to resolve it.

Do you know what an excluded middle is? For example, when confront with a choice: true or false, there is no third choice. The middle is excluded because, for example, between a false cognition and a true cognition, there is no third option, a true cognition that is false, or a false cognition that is true.

Quite frankly, Zhiyi's argument fails the excluded middle test, rendering his position irrational. Nāgārjuna himself never violates the law of the excluded middle.

When we understand that the two truths refer to cognitions of objects, rather than objects themselves, then we can understand very clearly that the two truths are describing the experiential mode of perception of worldly beings on the one hand, and the experiential mode of perception of āryas in equipoise on the other.

Worldly beings can conceptually infer ultimate truth (otherwise, they could never realize it); but even that inference is not their experiential mode of perception, since an inference too is just a relative truth, even in mundane equipoise.
