No, for example, omniscience. This is a quality of Buddhahood that Kamashila, (and numerous other masters) assert arises from a cause. The result, i.e. the two kāyas, is considered to arise from gathering the accumulations of the merit and wisdom. That is what is meant by saying the "the vehicle of the cause". The vehicle of the result is so called, because one takes the result as path in order to rapidly gather the two accumulations.

When you do medium thun for example, it is sufficient to visualize offerings. If you want to set them up, that is ok too. Whatever you have space and time for.

In general, there are only two things that you need for offerings (apart from the Ganapuja), according to my understanding of ChNN's intent: light and incense, and even these are not absolutely required.

If you like setting out water offerings, sense offering, medicine and blood, tormas and so on -- go for it -- but it is not absolutely necessary. After all, the universe is a torma according to the torma tantra.

Nevertheless, there is not necessarily any need to ejaculate it if it happens to become a waste product, because it will come out on its own with our urine during defecation, or even during urination alone. At the very least, Sukrha can also be absorbed back into and dissolved in the bloodstream.

My posts have been moved a number of times from the Madhyamika vs Svatantrika thread. Not my idea, and seemingly not a very good idea.

They are explicitly about the relation between emptiness and the conventions of language - and it was a while ago now, but there was fruitful dialogue on the matter.

This topic cannot in any way be "a kind of imponderable" unless you want to also classify the preoccupations of just about every Mahayana tradition as similarly futile and irrelevant to liberation.


catmoon said:
Moved posts? I did all that thinking for nothing? Oh, that's just depressing that is. I guess you'll just have to disregard the lot. Nothing else for it.

Maybe I can salvage something... when you use the phrase "This topic" in the above quoteback, were you referring to my "this topic" or yours? Emptiness is not an imponderable, but I think there is credible argument that the inner workings of a Buddha's mind often are. It could even be fitted into one of the classic 14/10/8 imponderables. (Number varies with sources used).

tobes said:
I'm referring to the topic my posts have been engaged with.

The references to a buddha's mind are merely a synonym for shunyata /ultimate reality. i.e. in relation to the two truths, the perspective of paramatha satya.

I don't think it's credible to argue that this is anything like an imponderable topic.

My take on this issue (as a professional translator) is that for general translations, there should be a short list of about 20-30 terms that are back translated into Sanskrit -- dharmadhātu, dharmakāya, vajra, prajñapāramita, dharmatā, etc. Then, depending on the specific literature, there may be more technical terms rendered in Sanskrit or not depending on circumstances.

Semantic nonsense. Are you really this foolish Malcolm, or is it a game?

Jinul’s Complete and Sudden Attainment of Buddhahood:
It is also the perfectly bright purity of the original true nature of sentient beings which abides in pollution but is not stained, which is cultivated but becomes no purer. When defilements cover it, it is concealed; when wisdom reveals it, it appears. It is not something which comes into being due to the arising-cause; it is, rather, only understood through the understanding-cause.

If someone looks back on the radiance of his own mind’s pure, enlightened nature and thereby extinguishes falsity and cleanses his mind, the myriads of images then appear together. It is just like seawater that has settled: there are no images which are not reflected. Hence it is called the ever-abiding function of the oceanseal of all phenomena in the universe. Accordingly, we can know that the perfectly bright and self-reliant functions of the dharmadhātu which remain, including the unimpeded interpenetration of all phenomena as described in the three pervasions, are never separate from the pure enlightened nature. As explained by Uisang, the dharma-nature is perfectly interfused, has no name or sign, and is free of all relativity.

Sucness is not a product, therefore, it is unproduced. Whatever is unproduced is not subject to conditions. Whatever is not subject to conditions is, by strict definition, unconditioned.

If you deny that suchness is unconditioned, you also disagree with the Madhyamaka school. For example the Tarkajvala states:

"The unconditioned is the two cessations, space and suchness"
The unconditioned is analytical cessation and non-analytical cessation, space and suchness. Analytical cessation is discriminating wisdom i.e. having analyzed and extinguished the evident afflictions, that analysis and cessation is given the name "nirvana". Non-analytical cessation is when a given thing is never separate from cessation by any means. Space opens up room and has the characteristic of being unobstructed. Suchness previously did not exist, nor come to not exist through destruction, is not [presently] mutually dependent and has no basis. Those four are permanent because their nature is unchanging.

I am afraid that trying prove that idea that suchness is niether conditioned nor unconditioned is fraught with definitional flaws.

Suchness is not a product, therefore, it is included among among unconditioned phenomena, like space and the two cessations.

A specific ceremony is present in their faith of protective nature but not of blanket nature. As in if one was to receive a curse one would then seek and receive a cure in ceremony from a spiritual person by participating.

I think a normal protective nature commitment in tibetan buddhism would suffice for this protective isssue.as one aspires to dhama one is protected by dharma.
This is not for me but for other who has this situation.

So.....(long winded)...does anyone know a protective empowerment teaching being given in the southwest perhaps central new mexico, albuquerque, gallup, southern colorado or western arizona.  This person is willing and able to establish a commitment.

Take it up with Vimalamitra. He writes about this in both the Copper Letters and the Agate Letters.

The vidyā that apprehends characteristics: “the vidyā that imputes phenomena as universals and as mere personal names”, is one’s mere non-conceptual self-knowing awareness defiled by many cognitions. 

The [vidyā that] appropriates the basis creates all cognitions when present in one’s body, and is present as the mere intrinsic clarity [of those cognitions] is called “unripened vidyā”. 

The vidyā present as the basis is the reality of the essence, original purity, that exists possessing the three primordial wisdoms. The vidyā which is not covered by partiality is present as the essence of omniscient wisdom. Further, that primordial wisdom is present as a subtle primordial wisdom. If that primordial wisdom did not exist, there would be no liberation from emptiness. Further, there would be no liberation from the inert. However, if vidyā exists as primordial wisdom, it would be no different than the realist’s nirmanakāya. 

The vidyā of insight is those vivid appearances when the instruction is demonstrated. It is called “the essence of the self-apparent thigle”. As there are many unmixed appearances, the Teacher stated:
Everything arose from non-arising,
showing the great miraculous display in every way.
The vidyā of thögal is the absence of increase or decrease in experience having reached the full measure of appearance through practice. Having completed all the signs and qualities, also they are not established by their own nature. When self-manifesting as omniscient wisdom, it [the vidyā of thögal] is called “abandoning phenomena”, “the exhaustion of phenomena”, “beyond phenomena”, “liberated from phenomena”, and “no arising even in mere arising”. 

Are those vidyās different or not? They are not different since there is nothing more than a single nature.

In Sakya the root lama is the lama who bestows highest yoga tantra empowerment:

From The Questions of the Contemplative Nyimo Gomchen and the Responses of Sakya Pandita What makes a person one’s true Guru? The person from whom one correctly receives the four empowerments in accordance with the Tantras in one’s true Guru. A Guru from whom one has not received such empowerment – how ever good a person he might be – is one’s Guru in name only, For example, the person from whom one receives monastic ordination is one’s true abbot, but if one has not been ordained by someone, he is not one’s true abbot. And even if he is called “Abbot”, he is such in name only. Thus: “without bestowing empowerment, there is no Guru. Without monastic ordination, there is no abbot. Without precepts, there is no continuum of virtue. Without going for refuge, one is not a spiritual person.” That is the meaning of the above verse.

Not known from another; peaceful; lacking proliferation with proliferations;
non-conceptual; undifferentiated — that is the characteristic of reality.



Buddhapalita comments:
"'Not known from another"; here not known from another i.e. not scriptural, but one's direct perception, thus it is a convention for one's direct perception. "Peaceful"  is a convention for "empty by nature".  "Lacking proliferation with proliferations" is a convention for freedom from mundane phenomena. "Non-conceptual" means not designated "This is this". Undifferentiated means not different objects such as "though it this, it is also this". Why is that? Because of lacking concepts, there is no proliferation with proliferations. Why? Because there is no proliferation by mundane phenomena. Why? Because that is peaceful, it is undifferentiated. Therefore, the knowledge of such a nature is a personal knowledge, not known from elsewhere. That should be understood to be the characteristic of reality.
According to Mahāyāna, a buddha is in a state of continuous equipoise on reality. It is impossible therefore that a buddha will experience concepts.

If you say that rigpa is only a "gnosis" than this makes things more complicated --it means in order to have that knowledge you must already be awakened. But this is not the case. Rigpa is the knowledge you have that allows you to wake up.  Rigpa is a complicated word in Dzogchen texts, and has different meanings in different contexts, but generally it just means knowledge, which in English is the antonym of ignorance (ma rig pa). Conceptual knowledge is inlcuded under the general definition of vidyā, this is a poorly understood point.

Section 1031 essentially repeals the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 by authorizing the U.S. military to perform law enforcement functions on American soil.

What you're really saying is that vajra speech emanates from the dharmakaya right (i.e. as the sambogakaya)? So it is ontologically distinct from ordinary speech.

I would accept the argument that sambogakaya contains a multiplicity of different communicative modes, many of which are not linguistic.

But when there is linguistic communication, that involves words, symbols, signs, signifiers. So I suppose the question is: how can a signifier (or chain of signifiers which comprise a sentence) not be a concept?

Hi
At the age of 13 I started having a restless, burning and itching sensation in the chest. It is located at around four cm above the lower tip of the chestbone. It strenthens and weakens in waves, and at times it is so intense it is driving me mad, especially at night (it often begins in the afternoon, exhausts me through the night, and releases in the early morning. It is accompanied by feeling hot and dry on the body surface, itching of the skin (especially in the groin area), and excessive thirst. Holding something cool to the chest, and moving around is what I have found to ease the sensation. Often I have thought this might be heartburn, but once when the sensation was particularly tormenting I decided to lie completely still and listen to it in hope of figuring out what it was. In waves it grew stronger and stronger until at a point when I felt I was dying it exploded into blissful waves of "energy" going up and down the body, making me laugh and cry uncontrollably. After this the sensation was gone for some years, but now it is back. Do you know what this could be, and how to treat it?
I have made the following self-diagnosis: The itching sensation in the chest is in fact heartburn, probably due to a hiatus hernia that I recently learned that "everybody" on my mothers side of the family has. The blissful energy waves was bliss arising from concentration on unpleasant sensation.

Do tibetan medicne have useful treatment for heartburn?

That's just as bad as any creation myth I ever heard.

Malcolm wrote:
This is a truncated version of a much better version:

When that is applied to the tortoise of the basis, first, out of total nothingness there is the so called "primordially existing or abiding tortoise". And from this arose, or were produced, all the Buddhas of the three times and all the sentient beings of the three realms. The example for that is the void of spacem and since the meaning is the dharmadhātu of Samantabhadra, it exists without any coalescence or separation in any of the three times. No head or tail can be seen here, no limbs are shown here, in terms of time, here it abides without abiding. Without grasping to any extremes -- Buddhas and sentient beings are in that. The dharmakāya, the sambhogakāya, and the nirmanakāya, the emanations of the body, speech, mind, qualities and activities of the Victors, male, female, neuters, moving and resting and so on -- that superior one is called the "abiding tortoise"
Second, the tortoise of formation: the seven water maṇḍalas come from the moist breath of the abiding tortoise and from the mouth of the tortoise formes a green maṇḍala of water. Above that, from the flesh of the tortoise form Meru, the oceans and major and minor continents and the golden firmament. The pores of the tortoise form as grass and trees. That is the description of the tortoise of formation.
The golden tortoise of existence is the tortoise of existence that comes from the meeting of the tortoise of abiding and the tortoise of formation. The head of the tortoise of existence faces south. The rear-end faces north. The four limbs are in the four intermediate directions.
From its white carapace, Grandfather Sky [khen pa rgad bu] formed as heaven.
Above, the region of the gods arises, the four formless realms, the great god Brahma of the pure abodes and so on. Below that arose the Trāyāstriṁśāḥ gods and the Paranirmitavaśavartino gods on the top of Meru. On the slopes of Meru arose the four great king gods, the sun, the moon and all of the planets and stars.
The sun and moon arose from the eyes of the tortoise, and the sound of thunder came from the sound of his palate. Lightning flashes from his extended tongue produced thunder bolts and hail.
Wind came from the breath of the tortoise, the five external elements came from his five functional organs.
Earthquakes were caused by the movements of the tortoise’s body. The golden belly of the tortoise formed or arose from Grandmother Earth [khon ma rgan mo] as the ground. And from that region of the nāgās, the eight wild nāgās and so on, arose.
Furthermore, that tortoise of existence is divided into two, method and wisdom or male and female. The golden tortoise of mentation is equal with space, the nature of method, and face down. The silver tortoise of phenomenal objects is equal with the surface of the world, is the nature of wisdom and lays on its back and so on, as it is in the many methods of explanation.

I'd agree that the way a Buddha perceives a given phenomenal object is devoid of any conceptual content.

But it doesn't matter how spontaneous a Buddha's interactions with sentient beings may be: if the Buddha speaks she is using concepts. Concepts which are necessarily conventional.

How could speech possibly be non-conceptual???

Malcolm wrote:
It is simply a Tsongkhapa vs. the world argument.

As far as Buddha's speech goes, as the Guhyasamaja says, "A single vajra word is heard differently by different sentient beings". A Buddha's vocal actions are also non-conceptual.

This is a very huge polemical area in Tibetan Buddhism, but in general, Nyingmas, Sakyapas and Kagyupas hold that a Buddha's actions, whether verbal or physical are completely spontaneous and free from conceptuality and cognition of conventional signs.

They have perpetuated inequality and discrimination in the workplace based on age, the color of one’s skin, sex, gender identity and sexual orientation.

They have poisoned the food supply through negligence, and undermined the farming system through monopolization.

They have profited off of the torture, confinement, and cruel treatment of countless animals, and actively hide these practices.

They have continuously sought to strip employees of the right to negotiate for better pay and safer working conditions.

They have held students hostage with tens of thousands of dollars of debt on education, which is itself a human right.

They have consistently outsourced labor and used that outsourcing as leverage to cut workers’ healthcare and pay.

They have influenced the courts to achieve the same rights as people, with none of the culpability or responsibility.

They have spent millions of dollars on legal teams that look for ways to get them out of contracts in regards to health insurance.

They have sold our privacy as a commodity.

They have used the military and police force to prevent freedom of the press. They have deliberately declined to recall faulty products endangering lives in pursuit of profit.

They determine economic policy, despite the catastrophic failures their policies have produced and continue to produce.

They have donated large sums of money to politicians, who are responsible for regulating them.

They continue to block alternate forms of energy to keep us dependent on oil.

They continue to block generic forms of medicine that could save people’s lives or provide relief in order to protect investments that have already turned a substantial profit.

They have purposely covered up oil spills, accidents, faulty bookkeeping, and inactive ingredients in pursuit of profit.

They purposefully keep people misinformed and fearful through their control of the media.

They have accepted private contracts to murder prisoners even when presented with serious doubts about their guilt.

The 12 links of DO are not about physical life and death.  "Birth" is not about physical birth, and "death" is not about physical death.  It has nothing at all to do with the physical human body.

Kevin Solway, you should understand that there are two models of DO. The twelve links are the specific theory of DO applied to the process of samsara. It is derived from the general theory of DO, "Where this exists, that exists..." and so on.

The specific theory of DO also has four variations, serial, static, momentary and simultaneous.

Now, since the Buddha admonished Ananda for thinking DO was an easy read -- what are we to make of your claim to have "understood" it before encountering Buddhism?

In reality, DO is profound and subtle. DO is also one of those things that when we first read it, we all say, "wow, I already get that." But that does not mean we really understand DO. It merely means we recognize the concept to be true.

David N. Snyder said:
Assuming Namdrol's statistic is correct, that would be about 1% for the U.S. From my experience in Africa, the percentage appears much higher. At night, you can literally see rows and rows of people sleeping on the sidewalks and some onto the streets, taking their chances of not getting run over by cars and taxis.

That is true about the culture of helping people, but it can only go so far when the poverty is at such a large scale.

Do you mind elaborating on the apparent contradiction…

"A correct perception takes ultimate truth as its object" and "most Madhyamakas would say that objects are not perceived at all"

Or put another way how do you equate for Candra referring to ultimate truth as an object with Santideva's emphasis that it is not an object (9:2)

I understand that Gelugpa's in post meditation identify emptiness as an object and as such need to tweak Santideva's position but what about most Madhyamikas where ultimate truth is beyond any categorizations don't they need to tweak Candra's assertion which refers to ultimate truth as an object?

Tibetan astrology (skar rtsi) is tropical, since the Kalacakra is based on a tropical zodiac, unlike Jyotish, which is based on a sidereal zodiac. Incidentally, Kalacakra sets out to correct the calculations of Surya Siddhanta.

Elemental calculation ('byung rtsi or nag rtsi), often miscalled " Tibetan astrology", has nothing to do with horoscopy, and so on, so the Zodiac, tropical or sidereal, is perfectly irrelevent. It is based on the five elements i.e. wood, fire, earth, metal and water; the twelve years, tiger and so on; the eight trigrams (spar kha); what we call the magic square of saturn and its nine versions (sme ba).

But false perception is mthong brdzun, so what Candrakirti is clearly saying is that false/faulty/incorrect perception is relative, or totally obscuring, truth.

Thank you for continuing. It will benefit all of us.  Of course I took it: a correct perception of them (the perceived objects) is called ultimate truth. Thats why I asked you:  "Do you really think the so-called "objects", somewhere "out there", can be perceived correctly in the ultimate truth"?

Malcolm wrote:
Candrakirti very specificially says "yang dag mthong yul gang de de nyid de" i.e. " Any object [yul] of a correct (yang dag) perception (mthong) that is real (de nyid) " i.e. an ultimate truth. The he says mthong ba brdzun pa kun rdzob bden par gsungs i.e. "[The object of] a false perception is a relative truth."

He also specfies very precisely just before these two lines:

/dngos kun yang dag brdzun pa mthong ba yis/ /dngos rnyed ngo bo gnyis ni 'dzin par 'gyur

"Since all things are perceived correctly and falsely;
all things will possess two natures.

He then explains in his commenatary:

de'i phyir dngos po thams cad rang bzhin de gnyis 'dzin pa yin no/ /rang bzhin de gnyis las kyang mthong ba yang dag pa'i yul gang yin pa de ni de nyid de/ de ni don dam pa'i bden pa'o zhes bya ba'i don to/ /de'i rang gi ngo bo ni bshad par bya'o/ /mthong ba brdzun pa'i yul gang yin pa de ni kun rdzob kyi bden pa'o/ /de'i phyir de ltar bden pa gnyis rnam par gzhag nas/ mthong ba brdzun pa rnams la mthong ba yang dag pa dang brdzun pa nyid las

Therefore, all things possess two natures. Also out of those two natures, any object of a correct perception means that it is called "ultimate truth". It's own nature has been explained. Any object of a false perception is a relative truth. Therefore, after having demonstrated the two truths, among false perceptions there are also true and false."

In this instance, his students had lots of faith in him and thus there is a new lineage. Those who were not his students rather resented the Sakya sarmas as they were called for a while, these new Sakyapas later known as Gelugpas.

So while we all respect Tsongkhapa, we do not all assume that he achieved awakening.

given the tibetan proclivities for comparative tenets and hemeneutics, it would seem natural that ethical comparative works might also be authored.

Like in many cases, we give up freedom for security.

Mac may be more secure, but there are far fewer variations available. When you look at things like the apps store you can see how much stricter (and therefore less free) Mac is vs. PC/Android. People who build gaming computers to my knowledge almost always do this with PCs, and most gamers own PCs and not Macs. Many games are released on Mac only after on PC. Everything Mac is more expensive. Mac is a single corporation, PC's can be (like a Dell computer), but often the parts and programs are all separate entities, so you have more choice in which companies, which hardware, and which software you want to have and support.

Basically as a Mac user you are a Mac user in its entirety, and must abide by the rules that Apple puts forth. As a PC user you can have thousands of permutations of hardware and software, and there really are no rules. You can build your own PC, have a warranty for each piece of hardware, and if any burns out you can just fix it yourself. No warranty is broken for fixing your own computer, which is cheaper and easier on every level if you know what you're doing. In terms of customization you can fit a TON Of things in a PC. Your expansion capabilities are also much higher. If you have a PC and a new better CPU comes out, you just buy a new motherboard/CPU, much cheaper than being forced to buy a whole new computer for only slightly more speed.

In terms of security a good anti-virus and spyware program, and a little forethought about what you are downloading and clicking on, will remove almost all potential security breaches from happening.

No workstation mac has ever been hacked. Macs that have been hacked are webservers, and only because they are running some kind of webserver with outdated code. But the OS itself is very bullet proof unless you download something on purpose and install it, like mac defender.

He also points out that they accept the consequence that their own position is harmed i.e. they do not maintain a position but purely maintain a critical stance.

tantular said:
Old Tibetan was not a tonal language, so this couldn't have been the difference between the ca and tsa sde, and when Lhasa dialect did develop tone, both series follow the same rules. Nowadays Himalayan peoples in Nepal write their Tibetan names in Devanagari as if ཙ་ = च: for example ཚེ་རིང་ is always written as छेरिङ. I've asked people why they do this, and it's not because they're aware of the official Tibetan transliteration of Sanskrit (most have no idea), but simply because to their ears Nepali छ sounds like the closest equivalent of ཚ་; certainly far better than त्स्ह would be.

The Tshigdzöd Chenmo states that ཅ་ and ཙ་ both have 1) the palate as place of articulation, 2) the middle of the tongue as organ of articulation, 3) contact of tongue and palate as its manner of articulation, & 4) unvoiced, unaspirated phonation, exactly the same as Sanskrit grammarians describe च. Sanskrit-Tibetan phonological theory does not distinguish plosives from affricatives (these are both called spṛṣṭa/phrad pa ), or the alveolar ridge and palate (both tālu/rkan ). Therefore, Sanskrit and Tibetan grammarians have no theoretical framework for distinguishing the voiceless postalveolar affricate and the voiceless alveolo-palatal affricate. In India this wasn't a problem because the latter sound didn't exist. It does exist in Tibetan, however, and therefore the Tibetan language needed to have two series of letters, even if the grammarians couldn't exactly describe the difference between them. All Tibetan grammatical treatises are in agreement that the tsa sde was invented first to represent the Sanskrit ca-varga, and the ca sde was only developed afterwards, once Tibetans realized their language had an additional set of affricates not found in Sanskrit. According to legend, this happened when Thonmi had a conversation with a traveller that included the "six new letters of Tibetan":

སློབ་དཔོན་གྱིས། ཁྱེད་གང་ནས་བྱོན་པར། དེ་ན་རེ། ཞང་ཞུང་ནས་འོངས་ཟེར། གང་དུ་འགྲོ་བྱས་པས། ཟ་ཧོར་རུ་འགྲོ་ཟེར། གང་གི་དོན་དུ་འགྲོ་བྱས་པར་ཇ་ཉོ་རུ་འགྲོ་ཟེར། ནམ་སླེབས་བྱས་པས་ཅི་ཆ་ཟེར།

Ok, you are not understanding something -- kiun rdzob is relative truth, but actually means "totally obscuring" in Tibetan. 

But false perception is mthong brdzun, so what Candrakirti is clearly saying is that false/faulty/incorrect perception is relative, or totally obscuring, truth. 

The two truths are about how objects are perceived. They can be perceived in only two ways, correctly and incorrectly. Perceiving them incorrectly, a false perception of them is called relative truth. The word brdzun pa means "to lie" as well. Further, for example, there are two schools in Yogacara rnam bden pa and rnam brdzun pa i.e. true aspect and false aspect. The latter is the higher of the two. The term brdzun pa means false.

So a false perception is relative truth. 

When Shantideva is taking about the two truths, he says - ultimate truth is beyond the mind, because the mind itself is relative. The mind can never apprehend ultimate truth.

inherent existence or dependent existence do not see the truth of the Buddha's teaching."

Madhyamaka therefore do not assert any views. Not asserting a view does not mean "incapable of engaging in conventional discourse", something you gelugpas seem to be afraid of.

Unless you rig the question by insisting that having a view can only mean accepting existence, non-existence, both,or neither, then having a view means any opinion about the nature of reality.

I totally agree that people should follow what their master said, but i disagree that it's about "view", otherwise it will be an attack to dza paltrul rinpoche and all other nyingma monasteries/centres/groups following his trandition (or 'book').

No, preventing offer meat (at least fresh meat) is not 'lower tantra' view, because you don't even need to talk about meat to lower tantra practioners, they just don't use it. It is out of compassion and proper conducts of buddhism. Maybe just like ChNN advicing his group to 'buy meats from as many animals as possible', it's out of compassion (not because the view is higher, otherwise meat from one animal and many animals should be equal isn't it ). I don't see there's right or wrong between the two methods (as i was quoting from two great masters), but it's really nothing to do with the views. I don't think dza paltrul rinpoche's view would be lower than many masters at anytime, but i very appreciate that he pointed out important things that people easily miss in so-called high views. But of course, if someone can see sh*t equally as tasty sausages, he can comfortably say whay he want to say.

Conventional reality has gross and subtle aspects.  The gross nature of conventional truth can be established by valid cognition as explained by Dignaga and Dharmakirti (this is very important) because forms such as our body are objects of valid minds and they perform the functions they appear to possess.

Malcolm wrote:
No, it can't. All conventional truths are objects of mistaken cognitions, per Candrakirti.

The subtle conventional reality, that is, form being a manifestation of emptiness can also be established by the same reasons that establish emptiness, since they are one nature.

The first principle is: anyone who thinks of being a teacher, must first understand there are many teachers superior to him or herself. So in this case, better to send prospective students to one's own or another teacher.

If in the end it turns out that someone really cannot enter the dharma without your help, then and only then is it really necessary for you to act as a teacher. Then it does not become an ego trip.

But even in this case, if you do not have sufficient knowledge, understanding and pratical experience, you really cannot help others, you will only harm them.

In this case, it is better not to teach, even if there are no other teachers available.

According Vasubandhu, the meaning of dhātu is mine i.e. source.

The definition Tibetans (such as Longchenpa and Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen) give for dbying is dbyung gnas i.e. source. The proper, though clumsy translation, of dharmadhātu i.e. chos kyi dbying in a Mahāyāna context therefore, is "source of phenomena".

In Abhidharma dharmadhātu means the object of the mind, comprised all mental factors as well as three unconditioned phenomena. To distinguish this Abhidharma concept of dharmadhātu the Tibetans translate it as chos kyi khams i.e. element of phenomena.



deepbluehum said:
Honestly, I do not ascribe to those descriptions. It's a lot of poetry only, mostly based on faulty translations of fautly Abhidharma analyses (making the basic subjects far more complicated and abstract than they need to be), that have in turn given rise to entirely faulty traditions. But you can look at the early suttas yourself to see how the Buddha used the words dharma, dhatu and ayatana.

(Sabba Sutta)
http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka ... .than.html " onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;

"Space of Phenomena" is a bad translation of dharmadhatu. Then one gets into a whole bunch of stuff about space and yoga, which in my opinion is on a wrong track. I am a Vajrayana practitioner mind you, so I am not discounting the power of the path of methods.

padma norbu said:
You should be a guru then, no? It seems to me your understanding must be beyond those of the teacher you follow if you are a vajrayana practitioner.

deepbluehum said:
I cannot stress enough, one must clearly understand what "a dharma" is in Buddhist terms. This will clear up a lot. If you know  in simple and clear terms what "a dharma" is, then what a "dharmakaya" or a "dharmadhatu" is will be very clear. There is no dharma apart from perception and cognition. So right there you are Xing out "outer" phenomena such as space. Also there is no such thing as "intrinsic awareness" in Buddhism, so there is no "inner space" either. Light touches the retina (phassa) and the brain constructs an image (vinnana); the mind says "this is X" (namarupa). You get some feeling (vedana) of pleasure or pain, and love or hate it (upadana), which makes you want to do something about it (tanha). In other words, 12-links is the dharmadhatu/dharmakaya. There is no "dharma" apart from 12-links, so how could there be a "dharmadhatu" or a "dharmakaya" that is something else either? Not knowing this is avidya. Knowing this is vidya (wisdom).

padma norbu said:
"Like space" is not the same as space. "Space of Phenomena" is not talking about actual space. It is likened to space because, what else could you compare it to? All the analogies, such as the crystal ball, the mirror, the sun and space are just analogies, and always explained as such.

Despite what you have just said, I see no error in the Vajrayana definitions which was supposedly pointed out in the suttas you linked. If "dharmadhatu" is exactly the same as "dharmakaya," why did he use two terms? And why are all the Tibetan gurus apparently not as knowledgeable in the matter as you are?

Okay so what I meant is, since the Direct Introduction is as you say the meaning of the Four Empowerments, that we are Receiving not only the Four Empowerments of Vajrayana by default, but also the very essence and meaning of them?

About Dzogchen Samaya: So then it goes back to what I'd said at first, that we basically only have one Samaya, that is, to remain in Awareness of the Natural State, but also with Awareness of that by remaining in this Presence or Awareness we are eliminating or better said Self-Liberating the poisons/afflictions (i.e. kleshas, klistas, vasanas, samskaras, etc.) that obscure or cause us to have deluded perception of our Body, Speech, and Mind?

Another critical question:

If, in attending a Transmission, our minds are suffering afflictions at the moment of the Direct Introduction, we would most likely not recognize the Natural State at that moment? So in this case would the 'seed still be planted' so to speak, so that we could proceed with Rushen or Semdzin practice as to recognize that 'seed'? Or in such a case would it better to—instead of proceeding to practice Dzogchen—wait for another Transmission and in the meantime practice Shamatha/Zhine so that the next time we attend a Transmission our consciousness is more ripe for being simultaneous with the Guru's Pointing Out of the Natural State at the moment of Direct Introduction to the Nature of Mind?


Thank you.

Or does Receiving the Dzogchen Transmission, without explanation of which Samaya(s) come with the Transmission, automatically imply the 28 Samayas of Dzogchen and/or the four Samayas of Trekchö and Thögal? (Which are listed in Enlightened Journey by Tulku Thondup)

Direct introduction is the mother of all empowerments, or so it is said. It does not contain all four empowerments. It is the meaning of the four empowerments.

As ChNN says, the principle is not empowerment and then vows; the principle is introduction and then maintaining. It does not mean you have no samaya. You do. But it is basically boils down to the body, speech and mind samayas common to Nyingma.

How many transmissions can a Dzogchen student receive?
Should one strive to receive transmission from as many Gurus as possible when the opportunity arises?
Also assuming that you receive transmission from a Guru who is very busy and travels, how does one know when/how to progress with teachings when the teacher might be practically inaccessible due to traveling and having hundreds or thousands of students?


Malcolm wrote:
Limitless.

That depends on you. I have received teachings from perhaps forty gurus. Most of them Nyingma. I received Dzogchen transmission from seven of them. Three of them I am close to and have received may transmissions from. One is my primary root guru, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, though in reality for me they are all Vajrasattva, but in the end, I am a Dzogchen Community person.
Rely on your vajra brothers and sisters. They will help you.

Studying Crowley led me to Dharma. But I don't spend much time at all thinking about or referencing Crowley and Thelema and so on. For me, it is obsolete. Likewise, the whole western esoteric tradition with its Qabala, godforms, masonic roots, tarot and so on is obsolete for me. Once I gave myself to the Dharma, these things just became irrelevant.

Your time would be better spent on getting a handle on the five major and minor sciences, the study of Abhidharma and so on. At least this is directly connected with the teachings.

Right there, you have 671 Billion. That is more than half of the deficit. All that military entitlement spending.

Medicare and Medicaid combined is like 754 Billion.

So, like most Rebuplicans, you want to keep the army and spend more money on it, but strip people of already inadequate health care.

SSI brings in $925 billion - Social Security and other payroll tax
It spends $761 billion

Looks to be like SSI pays for itself pretty damn well. Nothing socialist there.

According to some commentaries he was an anagami (non-returner),[2] one of the Śuddhāvāsa (Pure Abodes) deities. He was the rebirth of a monk named Sahaka, who had been in the Saṅgha of Kāśyapa Buddha.

"When Sariputra said that she could not become a Buddha, she took a precious gem, her most valuable and cherished possession, and offered it to the Buddha, who accepted it. She then asked Sariputra if the Buddha's acceptance of her offering was fast, and he replied that, indeed, it had been quick. "I shall become a Buddha that quickly," she said and then she became a Buddha. This is proof that women's lot is not hopeless. All they must do is resolve to cultivate courageously and they too can become Buddhas."

Then, just as a strong man might extend his flexed arm or flex his extended arm, Brahma Sahampati disappeared from the Brahma-world and reappeared in front of the Blessed One. Arranging his upper robe over one shoulder, he knelt down with his right knee on the ground, saluted the Blessed One with his hands before his heart, and said to him: "Lord, let the Blessed One teach the Dhamma! Let the One-Well-Gone teach the Dhamma! There are beings with little dust in their eyes who are falling away because they do not hear the Dhamma. There will be those who will understand the Dhamma."

This Brahma is not the so called "ancestor Brahma". In fact there are many Brahmas, since brahma is a class of deva, and not a single deva. This brahma is just a brahma in the brahmaloka.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, I am aware that within Mahāyāna sutras there is some pointed mysogyny.

Fortunately, this does apply to all Mahāyāna sutras, the episode with the Goddess of the Ganges being a pointed example:

Sariputra: Goddess, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?

Goddess: Although I have sought my "female state" for these twelve years, I have not yet found it. Reverend Sariputra, if a magician were to incarnate a woman by magic, would you ask her, "What prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?"

Sariputra: No! Such a woman would not really exist, so what would there be to transform?

Goddess: Just so, reverend Sariputra, all things do not really exist. Now, would you think, "What prevents one whose nature is that of a magical incarnation from transforming herself out of her female state?"

Thereupon, the goddess employed her magical power to cause the elder Sariputra to appear in her form and to cause herself to appear in his form. Then the goddess, transformed into Sariputra, said to Sariputra, transformed into a goddess, "Reverend Sariputra, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?"

And Sariputra, transformed into the goddess, replied, "I no longer appear in the form of a male! My body has changed into the body of a woman! I do not know what to transform!"

The goddess continued, "If the elder could again change out of the female state, then all women could also change out of their female states. All women appear in the form of women in just the same way

as the elder appears in the form of a woman. While they are not women in reality, they appear in the form of women. With this in mind, the Buddha said, 'In all things, there is neither male nor female.'"

Different sutras are written for those of different capacity. Those with a mysogynistic bent, are, from my perspective, written intending those of lower capacity i.e. men who suffer from mysogyny and woman who suffer at the hands of mysogynistic men and wish to escape their "lower birth".

Truth is not misogyny.  Are you saying that all those great Buddhist minds, and perhaps even the Buddha, were misogynists?

Was the author of "The Ultimate Extinction of the Dharma Sutra" a misogynist?

[/quote]

The truth is that there is no such thing as gender in phenomena, as we see from the above exchange between the Goddess and Sariputra. Gender is an imputation.

Many great Buddhist minds seem to have suffered from a culturally embedded mysogyny, yes.

But not the Buddha himself. Why? Because he had many female arhats among his disciples, as well as some teachers, such as Dhammadinna, whose sermons may be found in the Majjihma Nikaya, quite extensive as well.

When Ananda convinced the Buddha to ordain woman,while it is true that when the Buddha ordained women, he prediceted it would shorten the duration of the his Dharma; it is also true that the Buddha predicted that the ordination of women would cause the Dharma to spread much wider. So all that exchanged was a bit of length for increased width. And we can understand here that what he was really referring to the ordained Sangha. Such teachings as Dzogchen are not under the same restrictions as Vinaya and lower sutrayāna.

In short, you are cherry picking citations to support your views -- you are not presenting a balanced picture, presenting both negative and positive representations of women in Buddhist texts.

Yes, the Buddha does. The only reason why Brahma though he created the universe is that he was the first being to take rebirth in the brahmaloka. When other beings popped out after him, he convinced them he was the creator since he himself did not know where he had come from.

Now outside of Greece, Italy and Spain, governments are not completely stupid. Aware of the fact that high debt is an unstable situation, they limit debt to avoid the above nightmare scenario.

Malcolm wrote:
The debt situation of each of these three countries is completley different and independent.

The Spanis debt crisis was caused by a building bubble that collpased -- basically, very similar to the US.

The Greek debt Crisis was caused by running large deficits, which caused their bonds to give yeilds as high as %15 (meaning they are very risky).

The Italian debt crisis is being caused by rising yeilds on italian bonds, which means that borrowing costs for the Italian goverment is rising too high to make it easy for them to borrow. Typically, when bond yields rise above %7 they become riskier. This is not happening because the Italians want this to happen, it is happening because of poorly regulated financial markets putting pressure on the price of Italian debt.

US exposure to all of this debt comes in the form of CDS -- invented by Wall Street.

It is time for the Euro to go.

I will take your suggestion here, Namdrol.

I have been studying Chandrakirti's madhyamakavatara, by way of a very lengthy and detailed teaching given by Dzongsar Khyentse Jamyang Rinpoche (pdf format). It is quite "meaty", and somewhat challenging. But of course, like was mentioned some of the commentary/teaching is done according to the Tibetan Shedra tradition, though I feel Rinpoche tries to keep it to its original form, rather then taking the positions of the various lineages or schools.

Has anyone studied this? Comments? (BTW, I found this much easier to digest than Mipham's commentary)

Is Chandrakirti perhaps not the best angle to take here? Do you feel that Nagarjuna/Aryadeva might present things in an easier format as suggested earlier? Can someone recommend a good starting point in terms of nagarjuna (ie. books/commentaries)

About Anuyoga I am not so sure. This is what I been taught about Anuyoga;

"Anuyoga focuses mainly on the completion stage (Tib. རྫོགས་རིམ་, dzogrim), and emphasizes the inner yoga of channels, winds-energies and essences" (Tib. རྩ་རླུང་ཐིག་ལེ་, tsa lung tiklé). Visualization of the deities is generated instantly, rather than through a gradual process as in Mahayoga.

The main point of difference between anuyoga and mahāyoga is view; the view ofthe basis in anuyoga dzogchen, from the beginning. For this reason there is no summoning of the wisdom being, or if there is, it is stated as a something like the commitment being and wisdom being have always been inseparable. Second, based on this, the method of creation is instant rather than gradual. That latter point is the most important difference between mahā and anu.

So it's clear from the above that you cannot conceive of consciousness, as you define it, as having an external cause - outside of the series of moments of consciousness.  The only way this could be possible is if one of the following were true:

1.  You conceive of consciousness as being inherently existent.
or
2.  You conceive of consciousness as being the only thing in existence.

Do you agree?


Malcolm wrote:
No -- Neither the first nor the second consequence are entailed.

A given consciousness is a conditioned stream, composed of moments, each moment being neither the same nor different than the previous moment (this is the solution to the problem of identity in a series suggested by Nāgārjuna).

There are infinite number of such given beginnginless consciousnesses.

The status of objects in general is purely conventional, I am happy with either the relative truth model of sautrantikas or yogacara -- does not matter much to me. Which ever you like.

If you prefer sautrantika, then the stream of material existents is also without beginning. If you prefer yogacara, all material existents are mental projections and have no existence outside of the mind that perceives them.

This is all from a sutrayāna POV.

Hi Magnus:

Actually, in gsar ma schools that is exactly what creation stage means -- if you imagine it is a mandala, it becomes a mandala. This is why it is called "path of transformation". We are transforming our impure vision into a pure vision. We do this to undermine our tendency to engage in afflictive attachments. If we see everything as pure, we will have less grasping. The creation stage is conceptual, not non-coneotual. The completion stage is used to cut attachment to conceptuality of the creation stage. Eventually, we are supposed to unify creation and completion so that we are in the state of the union of illusory body and luminosity aka mahāmudra.

This is partially why one finds criticisms of the two stages approach even in Mahāmudra upadeshas.

Guhyagarbha contains the view of Dzogchen, this is why the thirteenth chapter of Guhyagarbha emphasizes that the mandala has always been naturally formed [ye nas lhun grub] . So it is a very different approach. It is not really the approach of the two stages.

You are so conditioned by Anuyoga, you have a hard time relating to mahāyoga in and of itself.

It supports what you say solely from a Nyingma POV. But Nyingma is not the end all and be all of Vajrayāna. Sarma schools have a different POV, especially Sakya and Gelug. So you need to qualify your statements.

As to Anuyoga, what you practice is mostly anuyoga. Most termas are anuyoga.

You need to be able to differentiate what you have been taught from the approach of other schools. Your reading is top down. Since your teachers are all Dzogchen practitioners, it is natural that Dzogchen colors everything they teach.

Guhyagarbha is classified as ati of mahāyoga, actually.

In the case of each series, there is neither a beginning nor an end.  And yet one series is not the other one. Something separates them.

Let's say that the first one is consciousness and the second one is some other infinite series.  It doesn't matter, for our purposes, what the cause of the second one is (for example, whether it is caused by consciousness).  The question is, what is the cause of the first one?  That is, what is the cause of the particular infinite series that we call "consciousness".

Consciousness depends only on prior moments of consciousness

KevinSolway said:
Question for Namdrol.

Prior moments of consciousness are still consciousness. So what is the cause of consciousness itself?  That is, what is the cause of the whole infinite series of moments of consciousness?

Malcolm wrote:
As I said, there is no beginning to any given series, as the logic of dependent origination necessarily entails. In other words, consciousness is beginningless, also the other five dhātus (space and the four mahābhutani) are beginningless, since their cause, consciousness (i.e. the collective minds of all infinite sentient beings) has no beginning.

The Buddhist perspective, as indicated by the suttas and thousands of treatises, is that while consciousness contains the potentiality of all five elements, the five elements themselves do not contain the potentiality to give rise to consciousness.

However, you will find that when you move into Vajrayāna and especially the teachings of the Great Perfection, the explicit substance dualism of the sutrayāna is abandoned.

Up to this point, we have been discussing these issues from a strictly sutrayāna perspective.

In Vajrayāna there is begins to be a movement which recognizes that matter is in fact intelligent, rather than something inert opposed to consciousness.

This movement in Buddhist teaching reaches its fullest expression in the teaching of the Great Perfection (Dzogchen) where matter is seen as the pure expressive radiance of the natural processes of pure "consciousness" which in fact forms a non-dual field, punctuated, if you will, on the one hand by the delusion of non-recognition (of this matrix of radiant intelligence called "vidyā and jñāna(the name for the five elements in thier pure state)" because of subject/object dualism predicated on grasping identity in that which lacks identity) which creates serial point events called "sentient beings" and on the other hand, the wisdom of recognition which creates serial point events called "buddhas" and the shades in between i.e. yogis.

Within this scheme, nevertheless, karma as well as physical and literal rebirth are still quite possible and assumed because of the delusion of self-grasping. In Buddhism, ignorance (āvidya) drives rebirth and karma, and nothing else.

I was just reading that ChNN's point of view regarding tantra (extracted from Dzogchen Teachings) ... it can help to clarifies some points.

Training in pure vision is the samaya, or commitment, of the Tantric teachings.
That is good also for Dzogchen practitioners. For example, if you see your Vajra brothers and sisters as enlightened beings, as if they were your teachers, you will never have problems with them. On the other hand, if you always think they are the ones who are creating difficulties, you will always have problems. Thus, it is very useful to train a little in pure vision according to the Tantric system. This is why we also need this knowledge and understanding.
Of course, the methods of the various levels of the path are different. In tantra we use transformation methods, whereas in Dzogchen the method used is that of self-liberation. If you understand how Tantric methods work, then, when you learn the method of self-liberation as it is practiced in Dzogchen, you can better understand what the difference is between them.

Since the only thing other than mind is matter, then matter must be the cause of mind.  Likewise the only thing other than matter is mind, so mind must be the cause of matter.

Beyond the duality of "mind" and "matter" is the undifferentiated Natural World, which has various names.


Malcolm wrote:
According to the Buddha all phenomena in the universe, the natural world, are categorized into six classes: consciousness, space, air, fire, water and earth. Conciousness is the cause of the other five. Consciousness has the potential to give rise to the other five, but the other five do not have the ability to give rise to consciousness. It is not a relation of mutual dependence. Matter depends on consciousness, but consciousness does not depend on matter. Consciousness depends only on prior moments of consciousness, and since there are no beginnings, according to the logic of dependent origination, there is no fault of infinite regress.

In the example of consciousness, consciousness, according to the Buddhist model, is of six kinds: mental consciousness and five physical sense consciousness. The sole difference between these six is whether consciousness is conditioned by sense organs or not leading to the descriptors "eye consciousness" and so on. However, consciousness also exists in absence of a physical substrate, for example, arūpyadhātu beings, those beings of the four immaterial realms, have no physical bodies. In the Buddhist way of seeing things, mind and body are different substances, with different causes.

Ten Powers of a Tathagata
9. "Sariputta, the Tathagata has these ten Tathagata's powers, possessing which he claims the herd-leader's place, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma.[5] What are the ten?

10.

11. (2) "Again, the Tathagata understands as it actually is the results of actions undertaken, past, future and present, with possibilities and with causes. That too is a Tathagata's power...[7]

12. (3) "Again, the Tathagata understands as it actually is the ways leading to all destinations. That too is a Tathagata's power...[8]

13. (4) "Again, the Tathagata understands as it actually is the world with its many and different elements. That too is a Tathagata's power...[9]

14. (5) "Again, the Tathagata understands as it actually is how beings have different inclinations. That too is a Tathagata's power...[10]

15. (6) "Again, the Tathagata understands as it actually is the disposition of the faculties of other beings, other persons. That too is a Tathagata's power...[11]

16. (7) "Again, the Tathagata understands as it actually is the defilement, the cleansing and the emergence in regard to the jhanas, liberations, concentrations and attainments. That too is a Tathagata's power...[12]

17. (8) "Again, the Tathagata recollects his manifold past lives, that is, one birth, two births, three births, four births, five births, ten births, twenty births, thirty births, forty births, fifty births, a hundred births, a thousand births, a hundred thousand births, many aeons of world-contraction, many aeons of world-expansion, many aeons of world-contraction and expansion: 'There I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away from there, I reappeared elsewhere; and there too I was so named, of such a clan, with such an appearance, such was my nutriment, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such my life-term; and passing away from there, I reappeared here.' Thus with their aspects and particulars he recollects his manifold past lives. That too is a Tathagata's power...

18. (9) "Again, with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, the Tathagata sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions thus: 'These worthy beings who were ill-conducted in body, speech and mind, revilers of noble ones, wrong in their views, giving effect to wrong view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body, [71] after death, have reappeared in a state of deprivation, in a bad destination, in perdition, even in hell; but these worthy beings who were well-conducted in body, speech and mind, not revilers of noble ones, right in their views, giving effect to right view in their actions, on the dissolution of the body, after death, have reappeared in a good destination, even in the heavenly world.' Thus with the divine eye, which is purified and surpasses the human, he sees beings passing away and reappearing, inferior and superior, fair and ugly, fortunate and unfortunate, and he understands how beings pass on according to their actions. That too is a Tathagata's power...

19. (10) "Again, by realizing it for himself with direct knowledge, the Tathagata here and now enters upon and abides in the deliverance of mind and deliverance by wisdom that are taintless with the destruction of the taints. That too is a Tathagata's power that a Tathagata has, by virtue of which he claims the herd-leader's place, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma.

20. "The Tathagata has these ten Tathagata's powers, possessing which he claims the herd-leader's place, roars his lion's roar in the assemblies, and sets rolling the Wheel of Brahma.

21. "Sariputta, when I know and see thus, should anyone say of me: 'The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. The recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma (merely) hammered out by reasoning, following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him' — unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view, then as (surely as if he had been) carried off and put there he will wind up in hell.[13] Just as a bhikkhu possessed of virtue, concentration and wisdom would here and now enjoy final knowledge, so it will happen in this case, I say, that unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view, then as (surely as if he had been) carried off and put there he will wind up in hell.

IF we are talking about what Kevin Solway thinks, the first thing I will do is look up Kevin Solway's writings. When talkig about what The Buddha thinks, the first thing I will do is look up the what the Buddha said in that or that sutta.

If Keven Solway claims some idea for the Buddha, if such a claim, no matter how reasonable, is not born out in an examination of the record of the Buddha's teaching, then Kevin Solway's claim must be rejected. For example, if Kevin Solway claims that Buddha intended rebirth to be interpreted figuratively but an examination of the record shows Buddha intended rebirth quite literally, then Kevin Solway's claim must be rejected, even if I myself too do not accept literal rebirth.

For example, if someone were to say "Kevin Solway believes in literal rebirth", and examination of your writings will show this to be false, therefore, that claim must be rejected.

In this case, these are not appeals to authority -- I have no interest in whether you beleive in rebirth or not -- but I am interested seeing that the Buddha's teaching not being corrupted by modernist revisionism whether Buddha's teachings about this and that in the end prove to be false.

For example, Vasubandhu teaches a geocentric Meru Cosmology that is clearly at odds with modern cosmology. I do not accept this cosmology, but if someone were to come along and try to convince me that Vasubandhu did not teach such a cosomlogy, I would point to the Kosha and show that Vasuybandhu plainly did teach such a cosmology. This is not an appeal to authority, it is an appeal to fact.

Pointing out that Buddha universally teaches literal rebirth in the sutras is a fact. Do not think you can select one or the other of the four distinct presentations of dependent origination, serial, static, momentary and simultaneous -- they are all necessary for a proper understanding of dependent origination and karma. Part of that is the Buddhist doctrine of conception i.e.literal rebirth taught by the Buddha himself in Vinaya to Nanda and in the Suttas to Ananda.

Those who rejected literal rebirth were considered nihilists by the Buddha and his disciples.

If however you maintain that phenomena are only mental real, then you very little basis for rejecting any of the six realms, and none whatsoever for rejecting rebirth as frogs, devas, and hell beings, as well as humans.

In fact, you just sank your whole argument against rebirth. Saying that literal rebirth is not a fact when you at the same time deny that there is any physical reality at all is incoherent.

Your interpretation differs from mine.  Please try to use reason rather than appealing to authority.  The appeal to authority is a logical fallacy, and this should be taught by all Buddhist teachers.

Malcolm wrote:
If you are not a Buddhist, an appeal to authority of the Buddha is of course useless. If you are a Buddhist, then an appeal to the authority of the Buddha' teaching, as recorded in hundreds of suttas, is entirely appropriate.

Essentially, it is rational decision tree:

Does mind derive from matter? Yes or no?

If one answers yes, then one is a physicalist and there is no point in proceding further. Buddha's teachings have little value beyond their ethical content, in this instance. There nothing particularly special about Buddhist teachings on emptiness, dependent origination, and so on that may be not gleaned from Hume, Adorno and so on.

If no, then we can continue. If mind does not derive from matter, it must have a cause, nevertheless. If it does not have a first cause, it must have a conditioned cause. Since things like memory of past lives and so on are best accounted for through mental moments that exist in a serial continuum, two moments in a continuum being neither the same nor different from one another, things like memory of past lives and so on are easily accounted for without having to invent a self as a repository of information.

It is the nature of mind as a substance (dravya) that requires that all mind are unique-- this is well established by Vasubandhu.

It doesn't have anything to do with people being reborn as frogs or suchlike speculative nonsense.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, you can accuse the Buddha of being a speculator if you like. It is pretty clear that Buddha discussed person's taking rebirth as different forms of beings, animals, devas and so on and did so in a manner that indicates he actually beleived in rebirth as I have outlined it.

Now, you don't have to accept it, but please do not expect us to think that the Buddha did not beleive it. It is very clear that he did.

Do you honestly think the countless hell realms, with their mountains of red-hot iron and black flames, are physically real places?  They're not.  They are created by the mind of the individual, here-and-now.  The reason there are so many hell realms (countless, in fact) is because of the countless forms of suffering people create inside their own minds.


Malcolm wrote:
From a Mahāyāna perspective, this is a trivial point. Vasubandhu also rejected the physical existence of hell realms, but did not reject their existence altogether.

The suffering of a being experiencing a hell realm is far worse than any imaginable human suffering, however.

Those who reject literal rebirth don't argue such a thing.

Just as a candle can be used to light many other candles, which burn simultaneously, in just the same way mental activities kindle many other mental activities, in other physical forms, which function simultaneously. For example, a teacher can have many students, and a parent can have many children.

Cause and effect is a tree-like web of interactions, rather than a narrow linear channel.

Malcolm wrote:
As to the first point, those who reject serial rebirth do not accept the teaching of the Buddha on mental causailty.

As to your second point, this is not what the Buddha meant by rebirth. What did he mean by rebirth? You can read the mahāniddana sutta.

As to your third point, you are conflating the teaching about general cause and effect with dependent origination. Whether you decide to use the model of the Sarvastivadas (six causes and four conditions) or the model of the Theravadins i.e. twenty four conditions (i.e. 6*4) matters little. The teaching of serial rebirth or reincarnation was clearly taught by the Buddha in hundreds of suttas.

You can of course choose to ignore the Buddha's teachings on this point, and try to "interpret" rebirth -- but you cannot present this modified doctrine as the Buddha's own teaching.

For the Buddha, rebirth, punarbhāva, was a simple fact.

Either one accepts rebirth or one does not.

Arguing that the continual appropriation of new physical forms by an afflicted mental continuum that spans countless eons is not the Buddha's teaching is rather unwise, since it clearly is the Buddha's teaching.

It is unwise, therefore, to pretend that there is some other option, or that the Buddha meant rebirth only figuratively.

Arguing with people who do not accept rebirth is equally unwise because they are addicted to a trenchant physcalism and prefer a secular understanding of mind and life. However, such people, may, in a limited way, derive some benefit from Budda's teaching of dependent origination and so on even if that teaching will not lead them to ultimate liberation in this lifetime because of their addiction to views.

The answer to the thread is that yes, for Buddha karma and rebirth are for real. And if one wishes to have a full appreciation of the Buddha's teaching, it is important to understand this fact.

I'm reading the translation of Maitreya/Asanga's Madhyantavibhaga currently, which has Khenpo Shenga's commentary as well as a commentary by Mipham.  This particular text is more terse, perhaps, than Nagarjuna and Aryadeva's originals, but I'm sure glad Mipham wrote his commentary.

Hi Cone:

This is but one text out of many. The text you are referring has nothing to do with Madhyamaka, despite Mipham's bold attempt to make it fit into a Madhyamaka mold by riding roughshod over the text.
Shenga's MMK commentary consists of wrapping the MMK in Buddhapalita's commentary.

Rongzom states quite clearly that there is no need for the two stages in the sixth chapter of his major work -- his approach to Dzogchen works equally well if you are a tantric practitioner or not.

Plus there is a broad understanding in sems sde, klong sde, etc.  that deity yoga is not necessary.

I don't think Senge Wangchuk was that involved with deity yoga -- there is no evidence that he emphasized it at all. I am sure he knew it, however. Aro Yeshe either.

What you did before you practice Dzogchen is not that important. As you agree already, Dzogchen is not gradual.

It is not a debate. It is plain difference of style. Magnus is very Nyingma in his approach, based on his tradition and teachers. Magnus' idea is that ChNN students do not understand something important.

Personally, I think ChNN is the greatest master of Dzogchen alive. Just read my post on atikosha.org about him. But that is me.

Other people who follow other masters should feel their master and his or her approach is the best. Those of us who follow ChNN need to respect other masters and their students -- we should not get into some trip about this tradition or that tradition. Often these days ChNN is fond of saying that there is no "dzogchen tradition".

We need to strive for mutual respect. That is important.

Tögal is not especially complicated, but if not approached in correct way, will cause problems for practitioner.

Face it Magnus, people in the DC are _never_ going to agree that they have to do ngondro, creation stage, completion stage, etc., since our master says that the tantric approach to these things is not our approach and are not necessary. This is not the path that ChNN has laid for us.

As you well know, our master, ChNN says the only necessary thing for his students is Guru Yoga of White A. On the other hand, he also says that since people have many conditions and circumstances, they should not limit themselves, and this is why he provides methods such as tara, mandarava, namkha, serkyem, chulen, yantra, etc.

SMS level one is connected with the Dzogchen sems sde system of Sogdog Lodo Gyalpo. In his system one does a short ngondro retrea before main practice.

But if you are not an SMS student, then you are free to do what you like. Not everyone is in SMS.

In General, ChNN prefers people to understand their primordial state and to do Guru Yoga (which are the same thing). This, he feels, is much superior to any of the other uncommon preliminaries. So basically, he prefers people to skip over the other uncommon preliminaries and to make Guru Yoga their main practice until they have real knowledge (rig pa) of their primordial state. For example, he considers purification of the five elements better than Vajrasattva. And if you are going to do Vajrasattva, one week is sufficient, etc.
