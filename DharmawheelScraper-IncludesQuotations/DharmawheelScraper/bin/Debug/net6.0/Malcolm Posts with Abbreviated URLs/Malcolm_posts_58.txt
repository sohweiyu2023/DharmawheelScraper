My orientation towards the topic of supernatural powers is materialist because the idea that they manifest within the material realm requires that. Natural science is what analyses matter, so physical phenomena falls within that area of study.

Malcolm wrote:
It follows then that since rebirth is manifests in the material realm, you therefore must also come up with an explanation for it according to natural science.

Astus said:
Rebirth is the continuation of the mind-stream, and since mind is non-physical it is out of scope for material investigation.

Malcolm wrote:
The mind clearly interacts with matter every time rebirth occurs. How is this possible? How can a nonmaterial entity interact with a material one? What sound reason can you possibley have for rejecting all paranormal phenomena apart from the one that is the most paranormal of all, i.e., a nonphysical entity [a mind] appropriating physical matter [a body].

Surely you must admit that if the mind, a nonphysical entity according to you, can appropriate matter, such as a body and make obvious changes to it, it ought to also be able to make changes to other phenomena by paranormal means and be capable of other paranormal capabilities such as the ability to know other minds (other phenomena of a similar kind).

So why do you hold onto the  belief that non-physical entities can supernaturally interact with physical matter in the case of rebirth, and yet reject all other kinds of "supernatural powers" of the mind where the mind interacts with or influences physical matter?

If you state it is because the Buddha taught rebirth in the sūtras, well, the Buddha also taught the abhijñās and the iddhi-pattis as well. Why accept a literal interpretation of a supernatural feat [rebirth] explained by the Buddha in one place, and yet reject all other literal interpretations of supernatural feats explained by the Buddha. If you want irrational, your POV is the most irrational of all. And you have no other basis for accepting rebirth other than the fact that it was taught by the Buddha. You certainly do not accept rebirth because you have recall of your past lifes, Astus — or do you?

Astus said:
And for more than a hundred years experts of material sciences were unable to find any sound basis for supernormal powers, and not one person could actually perform in a controlled environment anything paranormal so far, I cannot see any basis for accepting such claims.

Well, you really only have two options:

a) mind is based on matter
b) mind is not based on matter

If a) is true, there should be evidence to prove that matter produces consciousness.

If b) is true, one will never find evidence to prove a no matter how hard one tries.

Now then, the Buddha clearly divides all of reality, material and mental, into six major divisions called dhātus, earth, water, fire, air, space and consciousness. Outside of these six things there is nothing else. All phenomena are composed of some mixture of these six entities. All insentient phenomena are composed of the five elements; all sentient phenomena also include consciousness as part their make up.

Now, in terms of personal experience, there is only one way you can confirm rebirth for yourself that is through developing the abhijñā of recalling past lives and the abhijñā of being able to know the minds of others. Failing the development of these two skills in meditation, one is left with inferences.

The materialist, yes Carvaka, perspective, is to reject inference as a valid form of knowledge, as well as testimony of reliable witnesses.

There is no further point to this discussion. Either you develop these abilities through meditation or you accept rebirth in the third valid form of knowledge accepted by the Buddha, testimony of reliable witnesses. Both you and Astus thus far have demonstrated only that you are basically materialists in your orientation towards these questions.

It is one of the leading arguments of this school.
They held that all of existence can be reduced to the four elements of air, water, fire and earth.  All things come into existence through a mixture of these elements and will perish with their separation.  Perhaps the most philosophically sophisticated position of Indian Materialism is the assertion that even human consciousness is a material construct. According to K. K. Mittal, the ontology of the Lokāyata is strictly set forth as follows:

1) Our observation does not bring forth any instance of a disincarnate consciousness. For the manifestation of life and consciousness, body is an inalienable factor.
2) That body is the substratum of consciousness can be seen in the undoubted fact of the arising of sensation and perception only in so far as they are conditioned by the bodily mechanism.
3) The medicinal science by prescribing that certain foods and drinks (such as Brāhmighrta) have the properties conducive to the intellectual powers affords another proof and evidence of the relation of consciousness with body and the material ingredients (of food).  (Mittal 47)

Malcolm wrote:
Your argument is senseless and supposes that the Buddha argues for first causes, which he explicitly rejects. This is why we frequently see such statements by the Buddha as "beginningless samsara" and "samsara without a beginning." According to you, when the Buddha makes such statements he is lying or by making such statements, he is proving he is not omniscient.

For example, the Ārya-saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna Sūtra states:
In beginningless samsara,
recall the result of positive deeds is happiness, 
the result of negative deeds
is likewise suffering, 
arising like causes and results, 
but do not engaged in false thinking. 
Whatever is made by a past cause,
likewise it's result will be obtained.
You directly contradict the teaching of the Buddha by rejecting infinite regression of causes because of your conflation of the unsuitability of infinite regress in logical argumentation with the fact that any series of conditioned causes and effects must be beginningless.

I can accept that space is a phenomenon but space as understood in Buddhism seemed very simplistic compared to space as understood in modern science, assuming it can be understood at all.

However, I find it hard to think of cessation and emptiness as phenomena.  If you say the state of cessation or the state of emptiness, then yes, I would think the label phenomena makes sense especially if the adjective unconditioned is to be applied.

Malcolm wrote:
Here, the term dharma [phenomena] means bearer of characteristics. That is all a "phenomenon" is. The term "phenomena" for "dharma" is very inadequate, but it is what we have.

Space and the two cessations, as well as emptiness, all are known through their characteristics.

Space is simply the absence of obstruction, and of the two cessations, the first is nirvana, cessation due to insight. The second cessation is simple absence of a cause for arising.

These three things make up the classic trio of unconditioned dharmas [there is also a kind of conditioned space, which is defined as a cavity. But that is not what is being discussed here].

Quite honestly, you need to familiarize yourself with how these things are defined in Abhidharma if you ever hope to understand them in a Mahāyāna context.

But the real point is that you and Astus have turned western conventional truths into ultimate truths by asserting that what you take to be laws of physics and so on to be immutable.

And while in all practical matters the veracity of such stories are at least irrelevant and not much different from superhero films, if someone claims for whatever reason that powers like levitation and weather changing exist, it is not a strong argument to say that only those with faith can perceive supernormal events. Although saying that actually fits what we briefly discussed with Anders here that experiences of siddhis are a matter of mind set, and that matches what I have said from the beginning that powers are not physical but spiritual. Similarly, if I were to argue that there are pegasi, I would have to provide some evidence for that, and excusing the lack of proof would not make my argument any stronger, even if I called unbelievers materialists.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes and no. There are two kinds "inclination" as you call it — natural and developed. Everyone has the former, but in order to possess the later, one must formally enter the Mahāyāna path. The way to do that is to receive the bodhisattva vows.

This a an obstacle well described in Mahāyāna teachings. As Sakya Pandita states:
Bodhicitta is damaged when one is ignorant of the qualities of the buddhas and bodhisattvas, and makes no effort to seek out such qualities for oneself. The antidote for those is cultivating devotion, enthusiasm and so on as much as possible.
If you do not give rise to faith in the Buddha's teachings, your bodhicitta will never have a chance to develop. As the Avatamska says, faith is the mother of all good qualities. Faithlessness is negative mental factor. You should examine this.

When the obscuration of affliction and knowledge are eliminated, falling back into samsara is impossible because the stream of cittas is not longer adventitiously contaminated, so how could it become contaminated again?

The reason there is an infinite chain of cittas is that cittas are relative and conditioned, each one is an effect as well as a cause. In this case the infinite regression is a reasonable inference, just as Nāgārjuna specifically allows that an infinite regression of tathāgatas in the past is also reasonable.

Thank you for taking the time to write this, Malcolm. It has helped to make your position clearer to me. While I still feel that it is a somewhat stiff and inflexible view...
It is more like an XML scheme. An XML schema that does not work is automatically not an XML schema.

I am willing to accept that it is one built on sound logic.
It is built on knowledge of the Dharma. But thanks.
I acknowledge that what I endorse can not rightly be called "Buddhadharma", or even "Buddhism", but I am hopeful that it can still bring benefit to those that have no choice but to adjust the traditional teachings to fit their own specific needs, without compromising the source from which it came.

Malcolm wrote:
The traditional teachings can't be adjusted. Core concepts like rebirth, dependent origination, karma, samsara, liberation are all essential and interrelated concepts which are vital for the very identity of Buddhadharma as a set body of practice and belief.

People can try to adapt the teachings to their life however they see fit, however, this approach, unfortunately, does not go beyond spiritual materialism.

The teaching best suited for people who cannot accept Buddhadharma is the teaching of the four brahma-viharas, described in the Kalamas sutta among other places. Here, Buddha does not pretend that the four brahma-viharas are a path of liberation, but recommends their cultivation to everyone whether they accept rebirth or not. This however is not Buddhadharma per se because the four brahma-viharas are common to all Indian religions and not the sole province of Buddhadharma. In fact the four brahma-viharas are termed "the vehicle of gods and men" precisely because they only assure higher rebirth in samsara and or happiness and contentment in this lifetime.

But let us not confuse the cultivation of such compassion and love in the four brahma-viharas with bodhicitta. They are not the same thing. While the latter indeed does depend on the former, without the sincere wish to attain full buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings and the career that entails, the former will never become the latter. Bodhicitta, the wish to become a buddha for the benefit of all sentient beings, is the defining feature of the bodhisattva path, just as emptiness is the defining doctrine of Mahāyāna.

So are the brahma-viharas and śamatha meditation beneficial for everyone, no matter what they believe? Yes, very much so. Should this be called "Buddhism"? No, because these two things are common to all Indian religions.

What if someone were to act exactly as a Mahāyānist does, fulfil the bodhisattva vow inasmuch as it applies to the present lifetime, and keep quiet that they were unable to honestly believe in literal rebirth?

Malcolm wrote:
The bodhisattva vows has two parts, aspirational and engaged.

The aspirational part means generating the motivation to become a buddha for the benefit of all sentient beings. That requires generating an enormous store of merit and wisdom and that cannot be achieved in a single lifetime by virtue of the methods of common Mahāyāna.

A person who does not believe in rebirth is someone who has an obscuration such that they cannot even take refuge in the Dharma, let alone develop the compassion needed to generate the bodhicitta to undertake the long series of rebirths in samsara needed to gather the two accumulations in order to become a buddha.

Whatever kindness, love and compassion you you have is still kindness, love and compassion but as it is not kindness, love and compassion attended with bodhicitta, it does not have the force to counter afflictions and so on. It is mundane. Still good, but not a path Dharma.

Since you do not believe in the goal and path of a bodhisattva how could you aspire to practice it? Perhaps you have confused the popular concept of a compassionate person as being a "bodhisattva" with the actual bodhisattva described in Hīnayāna and Mahāyāna.

The engaged part means practicing the six perfections for three eons or more until you have progressed through the paths and stages and entered Buddhahood. Apart from these two, there is no other bodhisattva practice. Vajrayāna may, if one holds the vows perfectly, shorten this time frame to one or several lifetimes at most, but even here, bodhicitta is still tied with the idea of undertaking rebirths for the benefit of sentient beings in order to attain buddhahood.

Even in the Hīnayāna teachings, rebirth is not an optional belief since the four sorts of āryas described in Hīnayāna texts are defined with respect to how many lifetimes it will take such and such a person to achieve arhats ship from the time they enter the stream, and moreover, where they take rebirth before hand. The Buddha's Dharma is inextricably tied up with rebirth as a key and vital concept. Without rebirth, the path has no meaning, there is no liberation to speak of, there is no reason to eradicate the afflictions that cause rebirth and so on. The negative consequences of rejecting rebirth and yet still claiming to practice Buddhadharma are so numerous that I can only barely begin to write them down here.

You see, this is why I make a distinction between "Buddhisms" and Buddhadharma. You can practice your secular "Buddhism" all you like, but it will never be Buddhadharma.

Further, and I will remind you, so called secular "Buddhism" is definitely not compatible with Mahāyāna view, since the very denial rebirth (there is only one kind, literal) renders the bodhisattva vow meaningless.

Your assumption that there is no inherent cause on any causal chains is just as huge as the assumption of theist that there is an inherent cause, a first cause, at the beginning of all causal chains.

Whereas if you take the straightforward meaning of Nagarjuna's statement that is without an inherent existence there can be no dependent existence, it then follows that since inherent existence is unreasonable, so is dependent existence.  This is so much simpler and tighter.  No need for mental gymnastics as well.

Within the Gelug understanding it's true that dependent origination can be said to merely exist (I'm not going to debate the validity or non-validity of mere existence) but that's a red herring here because dependent existence isn't the same thing as dependent origination.

If siddhis are real, as many practitioners of Tibetan Buddhism claim, then why aren't lamas visiting hospitals daily and blasting out the miracles and healing tons of people all the time?

If siddhis are real, then I say, "Great! Then find the local cancer ward and get to work!"

Malcolm wrote:
You cannot remove the karma of other sentient beings.

According to the Dharma, illnesses arise from the three humors, which in turn arise from the three afflictions, which in turn arises from the innate grasping to self.

The greatest miracle of all is when someone realizes selflessness because of the Dharma. Who needs demonstration of a siddhi greater than this? The others are just tricks.

In the most simple of cases, a dependent existence can lie in a causal chain that starts off with a thing possessing inherent existence (species 1) or it could sit on a causal chain that is infinite regressive (species 2).

Malcolm wrote:
I am objecting to term dependent existence. There is no such thing. Nāgārjuna states
Existence cannot arise from existence, 
existence cannot arise from nonexistence, 
nonexistence cannot arise from existence, 
nonexistence cannot arise from nonexistence 
where then can there be arising?
Therefore, arising, existing, and so on are all merely conventions.

Further, the "Tulku System" as it exists now, with the Labrangs, inheritence, etc., was a later development, and didn't start with the second Karmapa.  I don't know when it actually developed, but it, like all things "tulku-system-related," must have been retrospective.

An infinite regress of causes is only a problem if you assume that all causation must derive from a cause that possesses its own innate power to produce an effect.

There is a further stage called patience, where one turns away from all rebirth in the three lower realms as a result of the previously cultivated samadhi, and finally the stage called "highest mundane dharmas", which immediately precedes attainment of the path of seeing.

This is a Chinese cultural and medical classification, not an Indian one. In the Vinaya, as well as Mahāyāna sūtras of verified origin, when garlic is mentioned in group, it is mentioned with onion and spring onions/leeks/wild garlic (the exact plant here is a little uncertain, but it belongs to the allium family), never in a group of "five pungent herbs." This classification is unknown in India.

I don't think it is appropriate here to reject scholarship on the provenance of Mahayana sutras which have been accepted by Tibetan tradition and then assert that Surangama Sutra which has been accepted by the Chan tradition, is inauthentic. This takes Tibetan tradition as the standard, which is fine, but not when you are in the Chan forum.

Perhaps it is more reasonable to suppose that the Sutra takes a skillful approach to overstate its case in order to impress upon the readers that they should not consume these herbs, as other sutras also assert?

Malcolm wrote:
The standard is actually the Indian tradition, not the derivative Tibetan and Chinese traditions.

As to the second point, I have already shown how the text in question contradicts other Mahāyāna sūtra which all accept as authoritative. It is also well known that this text, the  Śūranagama Sūtra, has experienced a long and contentious history in China over the question of its authenticity.

Alright, but my point was that just because Tibetans don't accept it as valid, doesn't mean it's invalid. No one sect or tradition has a monopoly over what is or is not Mahayana. Things like vegetarianism are a good example of that. Chan Buddhists abstain from eating meat and Tibetans don't. That doesn't invalidate chan buddhisms stance on eating meat nor does it render it not Mahayana.

Malcolm wrote:
It has already been pointed out to you that the status of the Śūraṅgama Sūtra is not certain even within Chinese Buddhism and it has been subject to much controversy, unlike say the Prajñāpāramita or the Lankāvatāra sūtras.

That Tibetans eat meat is a Tibetan cultural thing. It has nothing to do with the Dharma and there is really no justification for meat-eating that can be found in Mahāyāna sutras. Avoidance of eating meat is well known in Mahāyāna sutras such as the Mahāparinivana, Lankāvatāra, and so on. Many Tibetan Buddhists have been and are vegetarian.

In general, if one is following common Mahāyāna one should not eat meat unless one is ill. On the other hand, there is no Mahāyāna vow not to eat meat which is connected with the bodhisattva vows. The Buddha mentions the faults of eating meat in many sūtras, but never made it a vow that one should not.

There are a few sūtras in the Chinese canon which were not translated into Tibetan because even during the 8th and early ninth century there was uncertainty as to their validity. Many Mahāyāna sūtras were translated into Tibetan first from Chinese sources and only later were revised with respect to Sanskrit manuscripts.

He likewise maintained that those who understand emptiness incorrectly were likes those who handled a snake at the wrong end or applied vidyāmantras incorrectly. He called such people incorrigible.

When one correctly apprehends emptiness, there is no support left for conceptual thought to rest upon, so it dissolves into itself, right on the spot. It for this reason then that Shantideva states:
When neither an entity nor a nonentity
remain before the mind,

That's not relevant. For example, if someone has not taken a vow to abstain from killing, there is still a negative effect from killing regardless. The negative effect it has, is the reason why it's a precept to begin with.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course it is relevant. Of the five lay vows, only the vow against intoxication is prohibition rather than a natural non-virtue like killing, taking what is not given, lying and sexual misconduct. Likewise, the monastic vow against consuming garlic is a vow of prohibition, as are most of them, and so therefore, no non-virtue is accrued when they are engaged in by novices and lay people.

On the other hand, there is no vow forbidding malice, envy and ignorance, the three mental natural non-virtues because hinayāna precepts apply only to physical and verbal actions, nevertheless, indulging in these three results in negative karma and ripening. Likewise, harsh speech, gossip and calumny are natural non-virtues, but there is in fact no vows against them, because the Buddha judged it would be too hard not to break these and because there is natural negative consequences.

Most of the monastic vows therefore are vows of prohibition only and are not natural non-virtues. Thus there are no negative consequences if lay people do not follow precepts meant for the ordained. Otherwise, for example, sleeping with your wife would become a downfall.

Malcolm wrote:
Precepts come from taking vows. If you have not taken a given vows, you cannot break the precept to which it is connected.

For example, fully ordained Mulasarvastivadin monks who eat  garlic and who are not ill are considered to have committed a downfall of duration. Eating onion or spring onions is considered an offense. Why? Because one should not enter a temple after eating these things.

But in Vinaya, the reason is given that sick monks are allowed to eat these things because there is no question that they will being going to a temple. If a monk eats these things, in the case of garlic, he should not enter a temple for a week, in the case of onions, for three days and the case of spring onions, one day. It is a downfall punished by brief period of banishment. But there is certainly no mention of going to hell and such things can easily be purified.

And as far as we are concerned, none of us here are ordained bhikṣus, so really, the idea that eating garlic is going to send one to hell is ridiculous. Not only this, but the Lankāvatara states exactly the opposite of what is stated here in this sutra about spirits:
Since the bhūtas will become terrified
yogis should not eat meat.
Likewise, yogis should avoid
various things such as
meat, garlic, onions and alcohol,
garlic and spring onions.
Yes, garlic is mentioned twice in this passage. Again, no mention of hell for eating garlic. One can infer from the passage however that it upsets local spirits and frightens them because of the smell, which is of course why garlic is used to repel spirits in Ayurvedic medicine and in many Buddhist texts.

I also would not go so far as to say it's just a Chinese Cultural influence. It's a prevalent idea in traditional Hindu medicine also, specifically regarding a "Sattvic diet" or "yogic diet". Garlic and onions are both rajasic and tamasic according to Hindu Ayurveda, and are forbidden to yogis because they root the consciousness more firmly in the body, etc.

Malcolm wrote:
Garlic is one of the main medicines we find in all Ayurvedic formulas used to repel spirits. Having actually studied both Tibetan and Indian materia medica (given my profession as a Doctor of Tibetan Medicine), I am quite certain of this. Also the origin story of garlic and onions is the same in Tibetan medicine and Ayurveda, since the former adopts much of the latter.

Second, there is no classification of foods by the three gunas in classical Ayurvedic treatises such as the Caraka Samhita, the Aṣṭangahridaya Samhita and so on. Foods are classified by their effect on the three doshas — in this case, garlic, for example, removes kapha and vata, among other effects.

The notion of the "sattvic" diet comes from the Bhagavad Gita where all tastes apart from the sweet taste are defined as rajasic. Tamasic food is all old, wilted, etc., foods.

Ironically, milk, butter, cream, yogurt and so on, as well as honey, etc., are all considered sattvic [vegan freakout here].


seeker242 said:
Sure, it sounds crazy to say "you will go to hell if you eat onions". But it seems to me to have a much deeper meaning than that. Master Hsuan Hua was a Chan master. Chan masters are notorious for saying things that have a deeper meaning than what appears on the surface.

The only food that will send you hell is meat you have killed for yourself or requested be killed for yourself. We are not Jains and Hindus who define their paths partially in terms of pure and impure foods which we may eat. Granted, if you practice lower tantras, you need to be vegetarian and avoid alliums, but this is because this is conduct attractive to Hindus, and so it is merely as skillful means.

There is no deeper meaning. The idea that eating garlic will send you to hell is patently ridiculous.

How to study Abhidharma?

I understand generally the 5 skandhas, 18 dhatus, 12 ayatanas, and how e.g. each one of the 5,18,12 can be divided into different categories, but do I need to remember like all the different factors of each one?

Malcolm wrote:
By studying Abhidharma you will understand:

1. Skandhas, dhātus and āyatanas
2. Mental factors and general causality
3. Dependent origination and Buddhist cosmology
4. Karmic causality
5. Affliction
6. Hinayāna paths and stages
7. The knowledges
8. The concentrations
9. Refutation of the person

If you do not study Abhidharma, it is very hard to understand these things accurately. You should understand it as a detailed commentary on the four truths of nobles.

The example comes from Nāgārjuna's Verses on Depdendent Origination:
Words, butter lamps, mirrors, seals,
fire crystals, seeds, sourness and echoes.
His Commentary on the Verses of Dependent Origination states:
Likewise, just as a butter lamp is produced from a butter lamp; the reflection of a mirror produced from a likeness; a seal impression from a seal; fire from a fire crystal; a sprout from a seed, saliva caused by sour fruit and an echo from a sound. Also those can easily be understood to be neither the same nor different.
In any case, consciousness exists in a series of single moments, so unlike a candle flame, it does not give rise to more than one subsequent moment of consciousness in a given series. As Nāgārjuna points out, the aggregates are serially connected. He says:
Those [aggregates], called ‘serially joined’, not having ceased, produce another produced from that cause; although not even the subtle atom of an existent has transmigrated from this world to the next.

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddha taught rebirth without making recourse to a self that undergoes rebirth.

There are a variety of ways of explaining this, but in essence, the most profound way of understanding this is that the habit of I-making appropriates a new series of aggregates at death, and so it goes on and on until one eradicates the knowledge obscuration that creates this habit of I-making. In the meantime, due to this habit of I-making, one continues to accumulate affliction and karma which results in suffering for infinite lifetimes, just as one has taken rebirth in samsara without a beginning.

But no soul-concept has been introduced in this thread, not at all. The sentient being I was in a past life is not identical with me in this life, even though I suffer and enjoy the results of the negative and positive actions that sentient being and all the other sentient beings engaged in who make up the serial chain of the continuum which I now enjoy. But when I die, all trace of my identity will cease since my identification with my five aggregates as "me" and "mine" is a delusion, and that identity, self, soul, etc., exists merely as a convention and not as an ultimate truth. When the habit of I-making that drives my continuum in samsara takes a new series of aggregates in the next life, it is unlikely I will have any memory of this lifetime, and my habit of I-making will generate a new identity based on the cause and conditions it encounters in the next life.

It is important to understand that this "I" generated by the habit of I-making does not exist and is fundamentally a delusion. But it is a useful delusion, just like the delusion of a car allows us to use one.

An analogy is using the last candle to light the next candle. One cannot say that two flames are different, nor can one say they are identical, but they do exist in a continuum, a discrete series.

The Buddha defined the four types of awakened person by virtue of the number of lifetimes it would take before they entered nirvana, for example, it would take a stream entrant to attain nirvana (seven), arhats achieve nirvana in this lifetime.

Stream entrants by definition are free from the fetter of believing in a self or an atman.

I'd like to ask you, Malcom, were individuals who had used the "incorrect orifice" in lay life prohibited from ordaining, or did the rule only apply to monks? Because if it was the latter, it frankly seems much more like a "no sex, PERIOD" rule.

Malcolm wrote:
The rule only applies to lay people. Sexual misconduct for an ordained person is any sexual activity at all that involves penetration or being penetrated.

People are not prohibited from ordaining unless they are intersexed, voyeurs or they are men who like to swallow semen. In the case of the latter, since the male and female ordained sanghas were segregated, one can understand that men with active sexual interests in other men in a celibate male community is problematic. However, while there certainly is sexism in Buddhism historically, there is almost no discussion of the issue of same sex attraction at all, apart from how it impinges on male ordinands.

I'd also like to point out that if there was a bar against gay men, historically that would make sense (sadly) due to much higher levels of homophobia.

At Savatthi. There the Blessed One said: "From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration. A beginning point is not evident, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating & wandering on. What do you think, monks: Which is greater, the tears you have shed while transmigrating & wandering this long, long time — crying & weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing — or the water in the four great oceans?"

"As we understand the Dhamma taught to us by the Blessed One, this is the greater: the tears we have shed while transmigrating & wandering this long, long time — crying & weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing — not the water in the four great oceans."

"Excellent, monks. Excellent. It is excellent that you thus understand the Dhamma taught by me.

"This is the greater: the tears you have shed while transmigrating & wandering this long, long time — crying & weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing — not the water in the four great oceans.

"Long have you (repeatedly) experienced the death of a mother. The tears you have shed over the death of a mother while transmigrating & wandering this long, long time — crying & weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing — are greater than the water in the four great oceans.

"Long have you (repeatedly) experienced the death of a father... the death of a brother... the death of a sister... the death of a son... the death of a daughter... loss with regard to relatives... loss with regard to wealth... loss with regard to disease. The tears you have shed over loss with regard to disease while transmigrating & wandering this long, long time — crying & weeping from being joined with what is displeasing, being separated from what is pleasing — are greater than the water in the four great oceans.

"Why is that? From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration. A beginning point is not evident, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating & wandering on. Long have you thus experienced stress, experienced pain, experienced loss, swelling the cemeteries — enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things, enough to become dispassionate, enough to be released."

I have seen a number of self-proclaimed tulkus lead their followers down pretty sordid roads. So, speaking as a westerner who has been in the Dharma for half of my life, and most of my adult life, it is better to nip this in the bud with a direct and decisive approach. Even, then, it relatively easy to get some Tibetan to sajy you are a tulku if you happen to display an aptitude for Dharma, and a bit of cash.

For example, i have no memory of any past lives. But I can infer that I was some knd of practitioner in my past life due to the ease with which I met the Dharma and gurus in this life. But I am not a tulku, nor would I permit anyone to give me such a recognition for a couple of reasons.

i have met a number of very sad individuals who have been very damaged by this fantasy, and others who used this fantasy to defraud others, and yet others who in my opinion use this idea that they are a tulku or emanation to expand their influence with the naive.

This is not Tibet or India, where there is a proper structure for educating and training reincarnated lamas, as well as a cultural precedent for it. Every western Tibetan Buddhist has a past life connection with Tibet, so it is better to emphasize this, but discourage the idea that someone us a tulku. As you know, to be a real tulku you should be recognized when quite young.

Other types of teachings are more dependent on being validated by the source. However if (as is the premise of my position) later generations of yogis that have realization confirm the value of the scripture then you can say it receives authentication that way, much like Shakyamuni giving his stamp of approval on something that Ananada said. Therefore the historicity of the source need not be the only source of validation. The validation can be confirmed by a modern master--but only by a master, not an academic.

The point is that it is not representative of the thought of Nāgārjuna I, and when it is conflated with Nāgārjuna I's works, it creates interpretive problems and headaches that simply are not necessary and obscure things.

Your analogy is not apt — it is not like there was a Nāgārjuna factory punching out texts branded "Nāgārjuna".

As a text, it is important, especially in a Vajrayāna context, but it should be treated on its own, and not as an emblem of some hidden or esoteric allegiance to the tathāgatagarbha school on the part of Nāgārjuna numero uno.

It is important to understand that Naropa thought it was a valid text of Nāgārjuna I, and to understand how that may have shaped his attitude towards things (less radically then you imagine), and so on. But clearly, despite Atisha's enthusiasm for it, he clearly understood it in light of Candrakīrti's approach to Madhyamaka. In other words, we need to understand this text, it's importance in formation of certain ideas because it was attributed to Nāgārjuna without conflating the text with Nāgārjuna's actual works.

I have really tremendous respect for KB's scholarship, but somehow, I think he has an emotional relationship with gzhan stong that causes him to err in his estimation of certain texts, even when he writes very clearly on textual issues and brings out facts that very clearly contradict and repudiate the claims that gzhan stong scholars make.

That is because Nāgārjuna I did not write it. The author of the Dharmadhātustava is the same Nāgārjuna who wrote the Bodhicittavivarana and the Pañcakrama.
I'm working off of Brunnholzl's book where he cites Candrakirti as having listed the "Praises" (the collection) as being authored by Nagarjuna, and Atisha specifically credits the Dharmadhatustava to him. Since you disagree, and since this is way way over my head, I'll let you contact Brunnholzl about it directly.

Yes, Candra lists the praises, but does not detail this one. The earliest reference we have to the Dharmadhātustava being a composition of Nāgārjuna is by Dharmamitra (9th century, disciple of Haribhadra) in his Abhisamayālaṃkārakārikāprajñāpāramitopadeśaśāstraṭīkā prasphuṭapadā-nāma. Naropa considers it to be a composition of Nāgārjuna's, as does Atisha and Jagaddalanivāsin. However, a commentary on Hevajra Tantra, likely composed in the 12th century, cites a passage from the Dharmadhātustava, saying only that "some ārya said,"...." — this indicates to me some doubt in Indian circles as to the veracity of the source.

So while of course there is a late tradition that this text was composed by Nāgārjuna dating from the ninth century (Dharmamitra), the absence of any reference to it all in earlier Madhyamaka sources, especially Candrakīrti, indicates it cannot be accepted as part of Nāgārjuna I's oeuvre. David Ruegg has also cast doubt on its composition, wondering at the fact that significant portions of it are reproduced in Atisha's Dharmadhātudarśanagīti which is included in the rgyud section of the bstan 'gyur, but I think Atisha was just riffing on it.

Given that the fact that 10th-11th century Indians like Naropoa and Atisha accepted the Mulamadhyamaka-karikas and the Pañcakrama side by side as the work of the same Nāgārjuna, I think we can understand that they did not know how to distinguish the authentic works of Nāgārjuna I from works by later authors of the same name.

Then there is the fact that the Dharmadhātustava was not translated into Tibetan until the 11th century ((like the Bodhicittavivarana and so on) by Kṛṣṇa Paṇḍita and Lotsawa Tsultrim Gyalwa, and I think we can understand this text was probably composed in early ninth century by the siddha Nāgārjuna. Also, if you examine carefully, you will find only that Candra mentions four praises as being authentic, these are the Lokakīta, Nirupamya, Acintya and Paramārthastavas. This does not mean these four are in fact compositions of Nāgārjuna, merely that they are a restricted list accepted by the middle period Madhyamikas (we can excluded the Madhyamakapradipa, because Bhavya and Bhavaviveka are different people).

Thus Śāntarakṣita is redefining rang rig for his own purposes as the mere clarity of consciousness in order differentiate consciousness from insentient phenomena such as rock, chariots, and walls.

Taking a look at Śāntarakṣita's definition of svasamvedana, it takes the form of: The nature of X is Y.
In this case, The nature of X (intrinsic clarity) is Y (the reflexive knowing of consciousness).
X and Y aren't the same thing, in the same sense that mind and the nature of mind are not the same thing.

It is not talking about the nature of the mind in that sense. However, from a Madhyamaka point of view, one cannot separate a thing from its nature, for example, fire and heat are not two separate things, clarity and consciousness too are not separate things.

Malcolm wrote:
Your second statement should be examined first — which svasamvedana is Śāntarakṣita advocating?

What Śāntarakṣita says in fact about svasamvedana in the root text is only:

Because a tripartite nature cannot be accepted
in the nature of one partless [entity],
such a reflexive knower
is not an entity that has an action and and agent.


Śāntarakṣita's auto-commentary states:
"Though a reflexive [intrinsic] knower is imputed in relative truth, it cannot withstand an analysis into one or many", thus [the issue] has been settled.
He then defines an acceptable svasamvedana:
That being the case, the nature of intrinsic clarity that does not depend on another clarifier is the reflexive [intrinsic] knowing of consciousness.
Kamalaśīla's Madhyamakālaṃkārapañjikā supports this saying:
The concise meaning is that the function of reflexive [intrinsic] knowing is only to be the opposite of inert substances such as chariots, walls and so on. It is a convention for a clarity that does not depend on anything.
And:
Due to the characteristic of reflexive [intrinsic] knowing being a mere entity of clarity, if there is an object that becomes the knower while it is being known, since this will consequently harm your claim for two aspects, you also cannot make such an assertion.
So this is quite a bit different than what most people take svasamvedana to mean. BTW, given this context, it is probably bad practice to define Śāntarakṣita's "rang rig", "svasamvedana" as either a "self-cognizing cognition" or a "reflexive knower", it is probably better to understand it as "intrinsic knowing", since that fits with how it is being defined above.

Then, Śāntarakṣita states:
One should know that external entities 
do not exist based on mind-only;
based on this approach [tshul]
one can truly understand the absence of a self.
And comments:
Based on the approach of mind-only, it is easy to understand the absence of nature [niḥsvabhāva] of I and mine, apprehending subject and apprehended object and so on, asserted as external to a concomitant mind. Since this approach is the non-existence of self-origination, that mind is also understood to be without nature. When this middle path free of all extremes is understood, the freedom from having a nature of one or many is truly understood as the absence of a nature.
In terms of the two approaches, it is true that Śāntarakṣita states:
Having mounted the chariot of the two approaches,
holding the reins of reasoning, 
in just that way therefore, they 
will obtain the Mahāyāna.
But it never clearly specified that he is combining Asanga and Nāgārjuna's system. In his auto-commentary, all that is said about this is a citation from the Lanka:
The Mahāyāna is included in two approaches. The brief explanation follows:

Five dharmas, three natures, 
eight consciousnesses, 
and two selflessness
encompass the entire Mahāyāna.
Kamalaśīla's Madhyamakālaṃkārapañjikā does however state pretty clearly that the two approaches are Madhyamaka and Yogacara. He expands on the list given in the Lanka as well.

But which Yogacara is Kamalaśīla referring to? It is pretty clear that Śāntarakṣita is not basing himself upon the Yogacara of Asanga and so on that, but rather the Yogacara of the Lanka and other related sūtras.

So, when I said there is no common ground, this is perhaps a bit of an overstatement, but what I really mean is that Śāntarakṣita is not basing himself on the treatises of the Yogacara masters.

Vajrasvapna said:
I was not talking about the definition of the absolute, both groups defined ultimate truth like emptiness through logic. However, a group accepted that it is possible to express and elaborate on ultimate truth while the other denies this possibility:
"The Indian Svitantrikas who followed Bhavaviveka admittedly differed slightly with respect to what may be termed their ontological interpretations of Buddhist doctrine. Nevertheless, the mode of argument favoured by them was generally uniform.
They believed that the principles of formal logic were not irrelevant to the demonstration of the Madhyamaka philosophy to an opponent. They employed syllogisms whose members were commonly admitted to be established by valid instruments of cognition. The Prasangikas rejected this practice because they maintained that on the occasion of ascertaining the nature of the ultimate truth, neither the subject of inference nor the reason exist for the Madhyamaka. Hence, they concluded it was inconsistent for the Madhyamaka philosophy to admit independent syllogisms, when the ultimate truth was investigated." p. 92 in 'Madhyamaka Schools in India' by Peter D. Santina,

Malcolm wrote:
This still does not amount to a "positive expression of the absolute".

In order to understand the difference between Bhavavivka and Candra, you have to refer to the argument I mention above. Basically, Buddhapalita states:

Vajrasvapna said:
Therein, some existents cannot arise from themselves because the arising of those would be purposeless and because arising would be without end. Thus, arising would not be necessary for existents existing in and of themselves.  If although [such things] exist, [they] still arise, and because there will never be non-arising, that is not desirable there. Therefor, something existent does not arise from self.

Malcolm wrote:
Bhavaviveka rejects this because this argument is not formed as a proper syllogism that an opponent would accept. It is a consequence, not a syllogism. He says of this that it is insufficient to turn someone away from the Samkhya view. He says:

Vajrasvapna said:
[A]nother explains "existents cannot arise from themselves because the arising of those would be purposeless and because arising would be without end." That is not reasonable because no reason [hetu] and example is mentioned, because the faults stated by others will be not dispelled...."

Aemilius said:
From Vasubandhu in Abhidharmakosa it seems evident that Yogachara had existed long before the time of  Asanga and Vasubandhu. Because Vasubandhu often calls Yogacharins the Ancient Masters. The meaning is that Yogachara was the ancient school when compared to the Vibhasa of Sarvastivada, which was then modern and that Vasubandhu was commenting on.

It is quite certain that the Three turnings of Dharma existed originally, because the Sravakayana had to include a strained explanation for it in their Canon, (i.e. that they all refer to the four noble truths!)
I think that Yogacara and Madhyamaka both originated from the Buddha himself.

Asanga was not a Sarvastivadin, some scholars think that he may have been a Mahishasaka in his youth. Vasubanhu converted to Mahayana due to the influence of Asanga.

usnisha said:
I am quite confused now,  Asanga the one who popularize yogacara isn't it ? how is he related to Mahisasaka?

if it is originated from Buddha himself, there should be a trace either from Mahasanghika or Staviras, or maybe from  Licchavi Vimalakirti ( Vimalakirti is not a bhiksu, but a Highly realized being) or other Boddhisattvas that manifest in human being during the Buddha's lifetime.

and more Interesting  if yogacara is originated from ancient time, is it related to Master Patanjali a non-Buddhist and   theosophy follower? Patanjali is the one who popularize yoga (= name is similiar ), and from my understanding, yoga is a kind of philosophy in  india.

all phenomena have not arisen
because it corresponds with ultimate truth —
this is called "the ultimate truth."
Due to the absence of arising and so on, 
nonarising and so on are impossible. 
Due the negation of that [nonarising], 
words for it are not possible.
He states quite clearly and plainly that nonarising was is taught by the Buddhas because it corresponds with ultimate truth. He then further examines nonarising and establishes it too is impossible in absence of something which arose, and that impossibility is inexpressible, there are no words for it.

Just to elaborate on this point, while we might think that uncritically accepting tradition is preserving history, it's not.
Further elaborating, in reference to the Sujato post: later narratives emphasize the "awesomeness" of the Bodhisattva/Buddha (e.g., they are perfect embodiments of pure compassion, they spend aeons and aeons of lifetimes preparing for Buddhahood, they don't suffer, they received a promise of Buddhahood under a previous Buddha, they are unambiguously omniscient, etc.). The earliest narratives, by contrast, emphasize their humanity and ordinariness (e.g., Gautama had to be encouraged to teach by a Brahma, he had to be badgered by his friend into seeing the last Buddha into a past life, he admitted to be unenlightened in past lives, he didn't describe himself as a bodhisattva in past lives, the extent of his "all-knowingness" is vague/limited, etc.). Sometimes we just conveniently ignore the early narratives (even Theravadins do this). When we do try to harmonize the narratives, by saying that the later ones are just developments of the early ones, it seems pretty clear that we're prioritizing the later ones --- we're interpreting the early ones in light of the later ones, and hence we have all these explanation like the Buddha's apparent suffering, hesitation and imperfections were only part of a show to teach ppl (e.g., the Lalitavistara Sūtra's idea that the Buddha's life was a play). Well, ok, we can do that, but can we really say we are serious about preserving the history in the early sources? Not really.

I'm simply wondering when the first evidence of "Tibet" and "Tibetans" appears. As my area is Sinology, I can say that Chinese records, which were unparalleled in the first millennium CE, do not suggest a coherent body of self-identifying Tibetans existed in any great number until perhaps the sixth or early seventh century. The Tang history states first contact was made in 634.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, this actually has no bearing on Tibetan history. For example, Kapstein notes:

The ascendency of the Pugyel Dynasty began sometime before 600, when Takbu Nyazi [grandfather of Srong bstan sgam po], the Yarlung ruler, became locked in conflict with the Takkyawo, the lord of the Zingpo, whose fiefdom was close to the region of of modern Lhasa. The Old Tibetan Chronicle, which is our major source for these legendary events, and represents the standpoint of the Yarlung princes, describes Takkyawo as a thoroughly evil tyrant, doing alll with in his power to thwart the counsel of the good..

And so on it goes, describing a war in which Srong bstan sgam po's father Namri Löngtsen takes control of Central Tibet from Tsang to Kongpo.

Then of course, the Tibetans began looking outward at the world, seeking to establish legitimacy through marriage. Srong btsan sgam po had three wives, one from China, one from Nepal and one from Zhang Zhung, the three major powers on his borders.

It is entirely fair to say that we do not have enough evidence about the period of 625-700 to say conclusively whether there was much in the way of Dharma in Tibet at that time, though it is probable that Wencheng had a contingent of Chinese monks with her.

We do know that the princess of Jincheng  [d.739], married to Me Agsom in 710, as Kapsein recounts, "...appears to have played a major role in promoting Chinese learning, as well as the Buddhist religion, to which she was deeply devoted."

It is however preposterous to assert that in the period from 775 to 825 there wasn't an explosion of interest in Buddhism with literally hundreds of sūtras and śāstras being translated into Tibetan at a furious pace.

It is well known, even according to Tibetan records, that the penetration of Buddhism into the populace prior to 750 was limited and tenuous, and after the reign of Srongtsen Gampo, Buddhism in Tibet was propped up by Chinese monks until they were kicked out in the early 8th century, only to be invited back during the reign of Trizon Detsen.

There are five traditional tribes described in Tibetan culture — this is what I mean by oral tradition — who lived in various regions of Tibet. The tribe that may be described by the Chinese as the Qiang are known in Tibetan as the Dong (གདོང་). There were also the Dru (འགྲུ་), the Dra (དབྲ་) and the Go (སྒོ་) and the Ga (སྒ་).

Tibetans themselves also preserve records of all of their kings going back to the first king of Tibet, Nyatri Tsanpo, roughly 128 BCE. Unfortunately, the earliest of these records themselves are rather late, found in Dunhuang.

What he was describing is present day Baltistan, where today there are Tibetan speaking Muslims who write Tibetan in a Persian derived script. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balti_people, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balti_language

So saying, that Hyechao passed through what is present day Baltistan in the eighth century, and using this as a measure for the state of Buddhism in the Yarlung valley during his time period is rather like traveling to Scotland in the 4th century and noticing there aren't any Christians and assuming there must not be much Christianity in the British Isles as a whole (a false conclusion).

This is where perhaps later śāstra material is useful as it can argue for the truth of Buddhist concepts rather than taking scripture on faith. I find Abhidharma rather useful too as it lays out metaphysics and explains it all quite coherently and systematically, and it generally makes sense.



Malcolm wrote:
We don't need Abhidharma merely to not "take the scriptures on faith." On the other hand, faith is a necessary faculty, part of the 37 bodhipakṣadharmas.

On the other hand, Abhidharma confirms that there is core of Buddhist thought and discussion that is ancient, which predates the writing of all canons.

Depends on what you mean by early. Pre 7th century? Not a chance. Tibetans managed an unparalleled cultural lobotomy. Even the Bonpos have no texts that truly date earlier than the early 11th century. So, apart from external sources and oral traditions there are no records of early Tibet. Separating out what might be truly pre-Buddhist material from the Buddhist era is very difficult. Namkhai Norbu has offered some theories in this respect, having to do with cultural differences between Indian and Tibetan rituals found in Bonpo liturgies, but in reality, pre-Buddhist Tibet is a matter for archaeologists now, like John Vincent Belleza.

When it comes to the imperial period, yes, there are lots of text circulating around that can be used to mine for evidence, there is also the Dunhuang collection, which has many important text, none probably dating earlier than the 10th century though. There are of course many interesting facts one could glean, but even here, did Lang Darma suppress the Buddhist monasteries? Or did he merely subject them to taxation? Why was he assassinated? There are things we might answer if we were given to speculate, but they would remain speculative.

Your understanding is problematic here. History is very much about dating the past, so as to establish a chronological narrative which is necessary to properly understand how events and trends unfolded. Archaeology can be quite useful in this regard, but dating can be done also through analysis of texts or even linguistics. For instance, the appearance of a foreign loanword in a language can be used to help date a historical event.

Malcolm wrote:
This is all very tendentious and is not scientific in the least, it does not lead to certainty about anything. These things really cannot be tested or proven.

Thank you very much for your responses, Jeff and Malcolm.

Malcolm, if I'm understanding your interpretation/translation correctly, it sounds like there are two parallel axes of development --- the one for śravakas (and Pratyekabuddhas?) deals with the eradication of afflictive emotions by way of penetrating the emptiness of self, culminating in a "samadhi" sort of experience. However, this does not permanently free one from future births due to the absence of insight into two-fold emptiness...The Bhumi path of the Bodhisattva, by contrast, involves the emptiness of all phenomena and hence leads to true liberation. Would this be a more or less correct interpretation of the Sutra?

More or less.

There is similar to Vinaya ordination lineages. A legitimate ordination requires ten pure bhikṣus. If one of them is impure (i.e., has failed to confess every transgression against the Vinaya prior to the ordination ceremony), then the ordination is illegitimate and any sort of "precept essence" is not produced or transmitted. In order for someone to be legitimately ordained, every single generation of ten presiding bhikṣus back to the Buddha would have had to have been pure with the ceremonies done according to specifications outlined in the relevant literature. It goes without saying that it is doubtful it was always done properly with completely pure bhikṣus present during every ordination. In the absence of legitimately ordained bhikṣus, then the whole notion of the sangha still being a superior field of merit is undermined.

This is perhaps the reason that the Sangha Merit field in Mahāyāna is not the Bhikṣu Sangha, but rather the Sangha of tenth stage bodhisattvas.

I checked the sutra in question in the Tibetan translation. It is not exactly the six and fifth bodhisattva bhumi. Here is another passage which clarifies things:

It is talking about equivalent stages of the eradication of afflictions in this case.

Other than the view of the abhisamaya of the śravakas abandoning fully the afflictions on the sixth or fifth stage, the latent afflictions are not abandoned and they have inconceivable deaths and transmigrations. They proclaim My births are finished, I abide in brahmacarya, my work is finished", uttering the lion's roar. Having said that, after they become throughly familiar with the absence of self in persons, their minds turn a period of nirvana.

What is here being stated is that that śravakas abandonment of active afflictions is equivalent to that of the fifth or sixth bhumi, but that they do not abandon latent afflictions and are thus subject to inconceivable deaths and transmigrations.

Another section, dealing with bhumis, states:

Beginning with the sixth stage, bodhisattva mahasattvas, śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas enter into the concentration on cessation. On the seventh stage, mental moment by mental moment, the bodhisattva mahāsattvas enter into a concentration that eliminates the characteristics of all things, but the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas do not. The śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas' concentration on cessation falls into the characteristics of an apprehended object and apprehending subject through possession of ideation. That being the case, if the characteristic of the absence of the different dharma's they obtain and the characteristic of diversity were to become non-existent, it would not be proper — on the seventh bhumi one is to concentrate on one mental moment after another. They enter into concentration without comprehending the intrinsic characteristic of the virtue and nonvirtue of all phenomena. That being the case, such a one who enters into concentration is not skilled in entering into concentration on one mind moment after another.

The point is the comparison with the concentrations, abandonments and so on of śravakas and pratyekabuddhas with bodhisattvas on the stages. It is not an assertion that śravakas and pratyekabuddhas are traversing the stages.

TheSynergist said:
I was recently reading from the Lankavatara Sutra:
Again further, Mahamati, there are five groups of people, each of whom attains its own [spiritual] insight. What are the five? They are: (1) the group of people whose insight belongs to the Sravaka-vehicle; (2) the group of people whose insight belongs to the Pratyekabuddha-vehicle; (3) the group of people whose insight belongs to the Tathagata-vehicle; (4) the group of indefinite character; and (5) the group of people to whom no insight is possible.
Mahamati, how does one know the group of people whose insight belongs to the Sravaka vehicle? There are people the hair of whose body will stand on end when they know and realise the nature of the Skandhas, Dhatus, Ayatanas, and [what is meant by] generality and individuality; their intellect will leap with joy on knowing and practising what belongs to appearance and not on practising what they know of the uninterrupted chain of causation, —such ones, Mahamati, are said to be of the group whose insight belongs to the Sravaka vehicle. Having had an insight into their own vehicle, they abide at the fifth or the sixth stage where they do away with the rising of the passions, but not with the habit-energy; they have not yet passed beyond the inconceivable transformation-death, and their lion-roar is, "My life is destroyed, my morality is established, etc."; they will then discipline themselves in the egolessness of persons and finally gain the knowledge of Nirvana.
Again, Mahamati, there are others who, believing in such things as ego, being, vital principle, nourisher, supreme spirit, or personal soul, will seek Nirvana in them. Again, Mahamati, there are still others who, seeing that all things exist by depending upon causes, will recognise in this the way to Nirvana. (64) But, Mahamati, as they have no insight into the egolessness of things, there is no emancipation for them. This, Mahamati, is where those of the Sravaka-vehicle and the philosophers make the mistake in their insight by regarding non-deliverance as deliverance. Therefore, Mahamati, you ought to discipline yourself in order to escape this wrong view.
I'm a bit confused by this passage --- it introduces those on the Sravaka vehicle as being able to ascend to the 5th/6th bhumi, and eventually discipline themselves to gain Nirvana. Then it discusses those Sravaka disciples with incorrect eternalistic views, seeking nirvana in soul/god etc, and says they will not gain emancipation because they don't have the knowledge of the egoloness of all things. Does this passage mean to suggest that those with wrong eternalistic views can still rise to the 6th Bhumi? Is there any other Mahayana Sutra that attempts to place ppl with eternalistic views on the Bhumi scale? I assumed that having at least some insight into 2-fold emptiness was a prerequisite for even the 1st bhumi.

Before I started making noises about it the culture here at DW dismissed anything like his presentation as a Hindu heresy. And, to be quite frank, the monks at Nalanda 1,000 years ago would probably have seen it that way too.

Some masters at Nalanda would have liked the gzhan stong view just fine, masters like the false-aspectarian Yogacara master Ratnakarashanti for example (upon whose writing gzhan stong is in fact largely based, even if this is unacknowledged.)

The main difference between the Indians and people like Dudjom Rinpoche is that the former made no effort to try and locate their view in the so called three turnings, because in fact the Indians simply did not understand the three turnings in the way it was later interpreted by generations of Chinese Buddhists, as well as Kagyus and Nyingmapas.

But the same can be said of the Karmapa. Historically he was the head of the Karma Kagyupas, but the other Kagyu sects did not see the Karmapa as "the head of the Kagyu lineage". If the Karmapa was 2 years old, to if the Chinese had captured him, someone else would have been appointed to the role.

So really Dudjom R. and the 16th Karmapa had parallel roles in the late 20th century. And since I saw both of them on tour I can tell you that all the Nyingma lamas in California revered him just as much as the Kagyus revered the Karmapa. So what Dudjom R. wrote may not jive with the culture of this website, but he was not a minor figure in the Nyingma tradition in the late 20th century.

The latter lies in the works of Rongzom, Longchenpa and Mipham, and no one else: among these three, Longchenpa is the most important. And yes, I have talked about this issue with several living, breathing Nyingma Khenpos over the years (definitely more than you), all of whom regard Dudjom Rinpoche as one of their gurus, and hold him in great esteem, but they don't all hold gzhan stong as the definitive view: some of them do, some of them don't, most of them think gzhan stong is quite irrelevant to Dzogchen, or so they told me.

The reality of it is, these days the lineages that have adopted gzhan stong as their view are the Karma Kagyu and the Jonangpas. However, given how much Gelugpa education the present Karmapa has had, I wonder if he will continue the relatively recent (i.e. 19th century) adoption of gzhan stong by the Karma Kagyus.

No, my point is that your campaign to somehow enshrine Dudjom Rinpoche's perspective as the definitive view of Nyingma is an epic fail. His perspective is definitive for those Nyingmapas who choose to follow it, just as Mipham's is for those Nyingmapas who choose to follow it.

I will point out, however, that Dudjom Rinpoche's book is not used as part of the curriculum at Namdroling Monastery in South India (Palyul), not is it part of the curriculum at Larung Gar in Tibet (the largest Nyingma Institution in the world), nor is it on the curriculum of Mindroling in North India, nor Dzogchen Monastery, nor Kathog, nor Dorje Drag nor Sechen. It forms no part of the curriculum at the six main Nyingma monasteries, so how can it be regarded as definitive by anyone?

This is not to say it is not a wonderful book, since it is, but it does not trump Mipham, Longchenpa and Rongzom.

Now, I have wasted enough time with you on your obsession, and frankly I have better things to do.

Going back to the original article, I remember criticizing it on facebook when it came out because of it's depiction of Texas (the only culture I really knew well enough to comment).

For starters Tejano is its own brand of Latin culture, which is neither homogenous with the Chicano culture of California, nor Mexican culture south of the border. Texas culture also has a huge influence from German and Czech settlers, which did a lot to not only influence the Europeans who settled in the state, but the Latin culture there as well. You don't really need to look further than the number of German town names dotted throughout the state: Boerne, Fredericksburg, New Braunfels, Pflugerville, Schulenberg, Groesbeck, Gruene, etc to see how many settlements there were. Kolaches and klobasnek (also often referred to as kolaches) are popular breakfast foods throughout the state. The accordion playing of the Europeans found it's way into Texas' own blend of Latin music, also referred to as Tejano ( example ). Similarly, Tex-Mex is it's own distinct kind of food as well.

I can see differences between the major metropolitan areas in Texas (San Antonio vs Dallas for example), and between the rural areas (Lubbock vs Halletsville for example) but the commonalities are a lot stronger than say, between Dallas-Fort Worth and West Virginia (2 areas linked in that article).

Four axioms with which bullshit is brewed. The amount of presumptions and assumptions in the following four points is astonishing, and self-serving.

Astus said:
Regarding the mentioned criticism of academic studies, please consider

McRae’s Rules of Zen Studies
(Seeing Through Zen, p xix-xx)

1. It’s not true, and therefore it’s more important.
The contents of Zen texts should not be evaluated using a simpleminded criterion of journalistic accuracy, that is, “Did it really happen?” For any event or saying to have occurred would be a trivial reality involving a mere handful of people at one imagined point in time, which would be overwhelmed by the thousands of people over the centuries who were involved in the creation of Zen legends. The mythopoeic creation of Zen literature implies the religious imagination of the Chinese people, a phenomenon of vast scale and deep significance.

2. Lineage assertions are as wrong as they are strong.
Statements of lineage identity and “history” were polemical tools of self-assertion, not critical evaluations of chronological fact according to some modern concept of historical accuracy. To the extent that any lineage assertion is significant, it is also a misrepresentation; lineage assertions that can be shown to be historically accurate are also inevitably inconsequential as statements of religious identity.

3. Precision implies inaccuracy.
Numbers, dates, and other details lend an air of verisimilitude to a story, but the more they accumulate, the more we should recognize them as literary tropes. Especially in Zen studies, greater detail is an artifact of temporal distance, and the vagueness of earlier accounts should be comforting in its integrity. While we should avoid joining a misguided quest for origins, we should also be quick to distinguish between “good data”and ornamental fluff. Even as we ponder the vectors of medieval polemics.

4. Romanticism breeds cynicism.
Storytellers inevitably create heroes and villains, and the depiction of Zen’s early patriarchs and icons cripples our understanding of both the Tang “golden age” and the supposedly stagnant formalism of the Song dynasty. If one side is romanticized, the other must be vilified, and both subjects pass incognito. The collusion between Zen romanticists and the apologists for Confucian triumphalism—which has Song Neo-Confucianism climbing to glory on the back of a defeated Buddhism—is an obstacle to the understanding of both Chan and the Chinese civil tradition. The corollary is this: Cold realism eliminates dismissive misapprehension.

"The Platform Sutra appeared in about 780, over a century after the events it describes were supposed to have taken place. Many scholars have struggled to identify the contents of some “original” or “core” version of the text that might date back to Huineng himself, but the utter failure of these attempts has only confirmed the late provenance of the text as we have it. Barring some miraculous discovery, we must consider the text as we first discover it, in its Dunhuang version."

Malcolm wrote:
]

Irrelevant.



Astus said:
On Huairang and his connection to Huineng (p 82-83):

"In the case of Huairang, the little that is known about his biography definitely undermines the historicity of the filiation between him and Huineng. First, Huairang’s epitaph was written in the year 815, some seventy years after his death, at the request of two of Mazu’s disciples, so it can hardly be used to suggest that the connection between Huineng and Huairang was historical rather than legendary. In addition, the paucity of detail concerning Huairang’s biography—he is said to have been a mountain practitioner who did not “open the Dharma” to others— suggests that he was historically insignificant. And, needless to say, nothing like the story introduced above occurs in the epitaph. In fact, the Transmissions of Treasure Grove [Temple] (Baolin zhuan), the Hongzhou school’s important contribution to the “transmission of the lamp” genre of Chan literature, written about 801, describes Huairang’s enlightenment as having been gained under the guidance of the Northern school monk Lao’an. Actually, none of the men traditionally recognized as Huineng’s most important successors—Huairang, Qingyuan, Yongjia Xuanjue, and Nanyang Huizhong—are mentioned in the Dunhuang version of the Platform Sutra."

Malcolm wrote:
Again irrelevant.

Astus said:
"Ultimately, our main conclusion would be that Mazu had a typically variegated life of religious training, so that even if the interaction between Huairang and Mazu was historical in some sense—and it would be rash to deny this possibility out of hand—this would not be enough to make Mazu Huairang’s successor, let alone a direct secondgeneration successor to Huineng."

Dan, seriously, this is just nonsense. Wake up and smell the roses. ISIS may be many things, but a convenient flag under which anti-establishment radicals might convene is hardly one of them. It may have a flattened, synchronic view of Islamic history, it may have left behind nuances of centuries of Islamic jurisprudence, but one thing people can hardly claim is that they are not Muslim in the fullest sense of the word. They just happen to subscribe to Wahhabism, and their execution of their Wahhabi values are completely consistent with the origins of Wahhabism in the late 18th century, you know, like when Ibn Saud and his men slaughtered 5,000 Shiites in a single day in Karbala in Iraq in 1801.

Dan74 said:
In 1801, the tomb of Hussein bin Ali (Prophet Mohammad's grandson) in Karbala was destroyed by the army of Abdullah bin Saud, causing anger among the Shiite Muslims.[1] Additionally, many people in Islam's holiest cities of Makkah and Madinah were killed and Prophet Mohammad's Mosque was damaged by his army in the same year. As a result, the Ottoman authorities found themselves in a situation that they had to punish the Saudis for their crimes because the Ottomans were the then-official ruler of the Arabian Peninsula. The guardian of Islam's religious places was the Turkish-Ottoman Caliph in Constantinople, Mahmud II.[1] He ordered that an Egyptian force be sent to the Arabian Peninsula to defeat Abdullah bin Saud and his allies. In 1818, an Egyptian army led by Ibrahim Pasha (Mohammad Ali's son) completely destroyed Abdullah's forces and took their capital, Diriyah in Najd. Abdullah bin Saud was captured along with two of his Wahhabi supporters. They were then sent to prison in Constantinople. Abdullah and his two followers were publicly beheaded for their crimes against holy cities and mosques.[1]

Malcolm wrote:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdullah_bin_Saud

The sole difference between then and now is that there was an Ottoman Empire to put down the Wahhabis, and force their very Calvinist interpretation of Islam into the deserts of what is now Saudi Arabia.

The fact is that it is Wahhabi/Salafi money fueling ISIS, mainly from the Saudis. The other point is that the Sunnis in Iraq are, in reality, barely more than 25 percent of the total population (Kurds have always been counted as Sunni for some bizarre reason), and yet they have had an uninterrupted reign of terror in Iraq since the 1979 and actually from well before that, dating back to the Hashemite Kingdom.

In reality the Sunnis in Iraq has historically behaved little better than White South Africans under Apartheid or Southern KKK fanatics towards the majorities under their rule.

For example, many people have claimed that burning apostates is unlawful under Islam —— well it isn't.

Dan74 said:
Haykel...explained he was specifically referring to two groups of people who declare ISIS unIslamic: Muslims he says are “just ignorant” of Islam’s legal and political history, and Christians who engage in what he called “the Christian tradition of interfaith dialogue” and declare Islam a “religion of peace.”

Haykel singled out CNN talk show host Fareed Zakaria as an example of the former, who recently said that ISIS’s public execution of a Jordanian pilot by burning him to death — which at least one prominent Muslim cleric in the Middle East also decried as “away from humanity, much less religions” — is “entirely haram,” or forbidden in Islam.
“That’s actually factually wrong — the burning apostates is in the [Islamic] legal code,” Haykel said.

...

Still, Haykel said his frustration with people of faith who try to disavow religious extremists is not limited to Islam.
“[They] present Islam as ‘Oh, Islam is a religion of peace,’” Haykel said. “Well, what does that mean? I mean, Christianity is sometimes a religion of peace, and sometimes a religion of war, depending on what time we’re talking about. There’s no such thing as a religion of peace.”

Oh, it is not that. Sakyapas have a completely different line of transmission than the Kagyus. The Kagyu line is Naropa, Maitripa, Marpa, etc. The Sakya line is Naropa, Phaimthing brothers, the translator Sherab Tseg, Mal lotsawa, Sachen, etc.

Note, that the order I give above it not as sequential as it seems. Not only was Marpa held to be a disciple of Maitripa, from whom the main stream of the Sahaja Mahamudra tradition so held to come from (bypassing Naropa entirely), but also Marpa is held to have encountered Naropa personally.

Mal Lotsawa was not only a direct disciple of Sherab Tseg, but he also received all of the transmissions for Cakrasamvara and Vajrayogini directly from the elder Phaimthing.

Now, it is true that some Sakyas have expressed doubt over whether Marpa directly met Naropa in person, but what should Kagyus care about what some Sakyas think? Likewise, some Sakyas have expressed doubts about whether the Mañjuśrī Lama Tsongkhapa encountered through the mediumship of Lama Umapa was authentic or not, but again, why should Gelugpas care about what some Sakya guy thinks? For example, Taranatha roundly criticizes the Padma Khathang literature in the introduction to Padmsambhava's life story as told by his Indian Guru, Buddhaguptanatha. But why should Nyingmapas care about what some Jonangpa guy thinks? Likewise, Dudjom Rinpoche claims that Lamdre really comes from the Heruka Galpo tantra, a tantra of Yangdag, but in reality, why should Sakypas care what some Nyingmapa guy thinks? You see, it goes on and on like this.

A final example, I have shown really quite well that the thee turnings of the wheel doctrine favored by Nyingmas, Kagyus and Jonangpas really has been employed in a way completely without any consistency with what the Samdhinirmocana Sūtra actually says about it, and have pointed out that in Indian texts there was a complete lack of interest in this idea, and that the source of making fine distinctions about them all stem from a Korean commentary that was translated into Tibetan in the early ninth century. Even though I am very firmly convinced that the way Longchenpa, the Third Karmapa, Buton, Dolbupa, and so on have used this brief statement as a hermeneutical key for unlocking the meaning of the sutras (albeit in very distinct ways) is based on a total mistaken understanding, still, in reality, what do Kagyus, Nyingmapas and Jonangpas care about what some Sakya guy has to say about it? It is sufficient merely to say Kagyu, Nyingma and Jonang hold the three turnings of the wheel as very important; the Gelugpas maintain that the second turning is definitive; and the Sakyapas think that the three turning of the wheel doctrine is totally misunderstood, and even so, it is not very important at all, and that if you assert that it actually refers to three historical epochs in the Buddha's teachings, you wind up with all sorts of knotty contradictions that turn the Buddha into a liar.

In general, the mature point of view is that all lineages have their own narratives, which are to be given respect, even if there is some disagreement about the particulars. That way, everyone's sweaters remain whole, even though they might require darning from time to time.

The author is not someone I would regard as an authority on the subject but the first half of his post (at least) agrees with my own knowledge ... not that I'm an authority on the subject, either.
His basic points are (1) that Tibetan Buddhism is (logically enough) the Buddhism developed and practiced in Tibet, (2) that Vajrayana (aka tantric buddhism) is an important strand within Tibetan Buddhism but most Tibetan Buddhists do not practice it, instead following a more accessible form of Buddhism (which is still, of course, Tibetan Buddhism), and (3) that Vajrayana developed in India and spread to many other countries, so Tibetan Vajrayana is not all of Vajrayana.

I'm not sure if that is much clearer than the blog post but I hope it helps.

As to point two: virtually all Tibetan Buddhists, apart from small children, have received major empowerments, and thus hold three vows. They are therefore Vajrayānists.

As to point two, it may be the case that Vajrayāna historically spread to Śri Lanka, Java, China, etc. But apart from Japan, the only place where Vajrayāna is practiced as a primary form of Buddhism is Tibet, Mongolia and the Himalayas, and in communities in India and abroad started by Tibetan exiles. Some might want to include Tendai under the rubric of Vajrayāna but I would not since Tendai subordinates Vajrayāna to sūtra. Shingon however is a Vajrayāna tradition. Its presence outside Japan is very negligible.

There is evidence enough to tell that Shenxiu - later labelled as the founder of the Northern School - was the first Chan teacher to gain fame and he was recognised in the imperial records as well. Then Shenhui launched an attack on the disciples of Shenxiu by fabricating the transmission story of the robe to Huineng. Then other factions came up with their own versions of how the transmission happened, as shown in for instance Adamek's The Mystique of Transmission.

Yes, there is a story of transmission developed over a thousand years and debated by numerous factions. There is hardly any clear narrative unless we believe in a single account of our chosen lineage, in other words, we stick to a sectarian bias and accept whatever that group wants us to believe. How can that be called living up to the ideal of realising the nature of mind?

Malcolm wrote:
[/quote]

It may have been debated in numerous different factions, but so what? That merely shows that a) there was a guy named Huineng, b) he transmitted Chan and was a patriarch c) was sufficiently important that people took a stake in various oral histories that surrounded him.

It does not mean however that Huineng never existed, was never an important lineage master, and that all lineages of Chan/Zen surviving today do not come from this single root.

Let me give you another example — the famed Mahāsiddha, Naropa. There are two versions of his story, the Kagyu version where it is reported by Gampopa that Naropa realized mahāmudra, and the Sakya version where it is reported that Naropa did not realize mahāmudra (despite the fact that Naropa's Vajrayogini is among the most profound Sakya transmissions). There are some other differences between the early Sakya accounts of Naropa and Gampopa's account, but the key point is this: Tilopa is recorded by both traditions as having commanded Naropa to give up the accouterments of a Pandita and to adopt the accouterments of a yogi. He was also ordered by Tilopa to desist from debates. Upon his return from his years of study with Tilopa, Naropa took up residence near Nalanda. Some tīrthikas were giving the four gate-keepers of Nalanda a run for their money and the king asks Naropa to intercede. Naropa agrees but finds he is unable to adequately debate the Hindus (perhaps because his scholarship was rusty from his years of serving Tiloopa). Tilopa arrives to save the day, and scolds Naropa for his disobedience. The key difference between these two early accounts is that in the Sakya account, Tilopa is recorded as having predicted that Naropa himself will be unable to realize Mahāmudra for disobeying his guru. Therefore, in the Sakyapa tradition it is a matter of record that Naropa did not realize Mahāmudra. In the Kagyu traditon it is matter of record that he did. Which tradition is correct? Who cares? One follows the tradition to which one belongs.

The earliest version of the Platform Sutra, written after the death of Shenhui, does not even mention Nanyue Huairang, who was later mentioned as the teacher of Mazu Daoyi in order to connect Mazu to Huineng. So, I could say that not only the name of Nanyue was added to the lineage of Huineng, but Huineng himself was added to the lineage of Hongren, both by people who wanted to establish their own authority. This is not to say that there might not have been people with names like that, however, it is clear that the lineage connections are later creations. That is, Huineng was not an outstanding disciple of Hongren and all we know about him from fairly contemporary sources is his name, and Nanyue was not a disciple of Huineng and besides his name we know nothing about from the earliest sources - and that source is actually the stele of Mazu.

Malcolm wrote:

So, even if Huineng might have existed, there is no lineage from him. On the other hand, it was the Platform Sutra that propagated Huineng as the true heir and made him the one true Sixth Patriarch.

Tradition is the idea that certain patterns of thinking and activity are inherited through time without change. Historical research includes investigating such claims, looking into the origin and development of traditions. For instance, through findings in the 20th century it has become obvious that the Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch is a later creation and not an account of actual events and teachings. Since all living Zen lineages originate from the Sixth Patriarch, and lineage is the single basis of authority in Zen, it is not at all irrelevant whether the tradition has a historical validity or not, exactly because lineage is a powerful argument only as long as it can be perceived as true.

They merrily hack away at the body of Dharma, trying to remove what they perceive to problems and inconsistencies, blind to the problems and inconsistencies they themselves are introducing —— this is, in all cases, because they have not received a proper education in Dharma, and properly followed a master. There is no one more sad than a putative Dharma practitioner who has no master.

One can try to couch the various approaches in the modern historiography of Buddhadharma in "neutral" distinctions such as "etic" and "emic", but these terms are merely subtle insults — at least the way the terms are commonly misapplied in Buddhology these days.

In terms of so called "Early Buddhism", this is merely a hypothetical Buddhism, a largely speculative project of reconstruction. No one ever practiced, practices or can practice such a thing as "Early Buddhism" because there is actually no such thing and there never was such a thing.

BRIEF HISTORY 1741- 1818

Abd al-Wahhab's advocacy of these ultra radical views inevitably led to his expulsion from his own town -- and in 1741, after some wanderings, he found refuge under the protection of Ibn Saud and his tribe. What Ibn Saud perceived in Abd al-Wahhab's novel teaching was the means to overturn Arab tradition and convention. It was a path to seizing power.

Ibn Saud's clan, seizing on Abd al-Wahhab's doctrine, now could do what they always did, which was raiding neighboring villages and robbing them of their possessions. Only now they were doing it not within the ambit of Arab tradition, but rather under the banner of jihad. Ibn Saud and Abd al-Wahhab also reintroduced the idea of martyrdom in the name of jihad, as it granted those martyred immediate entry into paradise.

In the beginning, they conquered a few local communities and imposed their rule over them. (The conquered inhabitants were given a limited choice: conversion to Wahhabism or death.) By 1790, the Alliance controlled most of the Arabian Peninsula and repeatedly raided Medina, Syria and Iraq.

Their strategy -- like that of ISIS today -- was to bring the peoples whom they conquered into submission. They aimed to instill fear. In 1801, the Allies attacked the Holy City of Karbala in Iraq. They massacred thousands of Shiites, including women and children. Many Shiite shrines were destroyed, including the shrine of Imam Hussein, the murdered grandson of Prophet Muhammad.

A British official, Lieutenant Francis Warden, observing the situation at the time, wrote: "They pillaged the whole of it [Karbala], and plundered the Tomb of Hussein... slaying in the course of the day, with circumstances of peculiar cruelty, above five thousand of the inhabitants ..."

Osman Ibn Bishr Najdi, the historian of the first Saudi state, wrote that Ibn Saud committed a massacre in Karbala in 1801. He proudly documented that massacre saying, "we took Karbala and slaughtered and took its people (as slaves), then praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds, and we do not apologize for that and say: 'And to the unbelievers: the same treatment.'"

In 1803, Abdul Aziz then entered the Holy City of Mecca, which surrendered under the impact of terror and panic (the same fate was to befall Medina, too). Abd al-Wahhab's followers demolished historical monuments and all the tombs and shrines in their midst. By the end, they had destroyed centuries of Islamic architecture near the Grand Mosque.

But in November of 1803, a Shiite assassin killed King Abdul Aziz (taking revenge for the massacre at Karbala). His son, Saud bin Abd al Aziz, succeeded him and continued the conquest of Arabia. Ottoman rulers, however, could no longer just sit back and watch as their empire was devoured piece by piece. In 1812, the Ottoman army, composed of Egyptians, pushed the Alliance out from Medina, Jeddah and Mecca. In 1814, Saud bin Abd al Aziz died of fever. His unfortunate son Abdullah bin Saud, however, was taken by the Ottomans to Istanbul, where he was gruesomely executed (a visitor to Istanbul reported seeing him having been humiliated in the streets of Istanbul for three days, then hanged and beheaded, his severed head fired from a canon, and his heart cut out and impaled on his body).

In 1815, Wahhabi forces were crushed by the Egyptians (acting on the Ottoman's behalf) in a decisive battle. In 1818, the Ottomans captured and destroyed the Wahhabi capital of Dariyah. The first Saudi state was no more. The few remaining Wahhabis withdrew into the desert to regroup, and there they remained, quiescent for most of the 19th century.

Dear Malcolm,

I can well imagine that you'd like the last word, and that's fine with me. However, from the practitioner's point of view, the situation is really quite simple. Vajravarahi/Vajrayogini plays a part in the two practices of which I have the longest experience. Both of them are from the Kagyu tradition, neither of them is particularly obscure. In one of them she is called Vajravarahi, has a sow's head, and has one mantra. In the other, she is called Vajrayogini, does not have the sow's head, and has a slightly different mantra. I'm sure you appreciate that it would be completely wrong to interchange either the appearances or the mantras between these practices. For my money, that makes the two occurrences slightly different.

If you want to argue that they are nevertheless identical (which was the original poster's question, as I recall, although somebody seems to have manipulated the threads), while being somewhat different, then please be my guest.

Malcolm wrote:
The difference lies in whether the essence and near essence mantras are combined, as in the Om gsum mantra, or whether they are kept separately, as in some other sadhanas and transmissions.

The main point however is that we have two basic forms of one deity. For example, there is a Cakrasamvara in his Sahaja form, 12 armed form, up to a thousand armed form. They are all different forms of the same deity. Likewise, whether we are talking about Naro Dakini, Indradakini (Vārāhī), Maitri Dakini, or Vajravārāhī they are all different forms of the same deity.

In the sadhanas we have in the bstan 'gyur we frequently see this:

/bod skad du/rdo rje phag mo'i sgrub thabs/dpal rdo rje rnal 'byor ma la phyag 'tshal lo/

/bod skad du/rdo rje rnal 'byor ma'i sgrub thabs zhes bya ba/rje btsun dpal rdo rje phag mo la phyag 'tshal lo/

In Tibetan: Vajravārāhīsadhana. Homage to Vajrayoginī.

In Tibetan: Vajrayoginīsadana. Homage to Lady Śrī Vajravārāhī


Or in the Khyāvajravārāhyabhidhanāta-tantrottara-vārāhi-abhibodhiya-nāma
Arising in the center of that is the queen, 
Vārāhī, Vajrayoginī.
My point being is that these two terms are both used for the same deity, regardless of minor differences in mantra formation or appearances.

Sure. But Vajravarahi has the sow's head, Vajrayogini generally not. Whether you call them the same or close but different is up to the way you want to define your terms. It's not very important.

You can argue by that method that she is the same deity as Chakrasamvara. Maybe she is, maybe she isn't - but they look different. The rest is little games.

So not always in every case, just many.

Malcolm wrote:
The presence or absence of the sows head is not relevant. What is relevant is that the mantras are the same, the source tantra is the same, and so on.

Also, Yoginī is the essence of Cakrasamvara. When one practices Yoginī, Samvara is included automatically. The arrangement of the mandala is the same, the manner of the abhisamaya is the same, based on the Yoginīsaṃcarya Tantra, so on and so forth.

Also, when in union with Cakrasamvara, Vajravārāhī is never pictured with a sow's head, as she is always, say, when she is the consort of Hayagriva in Nyingma Tantras.

This is why I am willing to allow that Vajravārāhī in Nyingma is not necessarily interchangeable with Vajrayoginī in Sarma — the Vajravārāhī mantras in Nyingma tantra are not similar at all with the Yoginī/Vārāhī mantras from the Laghusamvara.

But I do adduce reasons in an earlier essay. My bad for not linking to it. I can sum that argument up for you in a few quick words. Pratītyasamutpāda says:
imasmiṃ sati idaṃ hoti, imass' uppādā idaṃ uppajjati;
imasmiṃ asati idaṃ na hoti, imassa nirodhā idaṃ nirujjhati. (My emphasis)
None other than Nāgārjuna points out the problem with any version of karma that requires effects to ripen after the conditions have ceased:
tiṣṭhaty ā pākakālāc cet karma tan nityatām iyāt /
> niruddhaṃ cen niruddhaṃ sat kiṃ phalaṃ janayiṣyati // MMK_17.6 //
Which translates as:

"If the action remains until the time of maturation, then it would be eternal
If it ceases, being ceased, how does it produce a fruit?"

Now, Nāgārjuna has a particular solution in mind when he makes this criticism. And Indrajala has already pointed out that other Buddhist sects had their own solutions. Which goes to show that this is not something I've simply made up. It was a problem widely acknowledged in the Buddhist world and many solutions were proposed, and polemics were written criticising them all by Buddhists of different sects. Far from being a shocking modern discovery, this is a boring 2000 year old argument. Though in my view it was never settled satisfactorily.

So I'm sorry that you felt the need to go on the offensive, but you are simply mistaken. The facts are very much on my side. Does this change your mind at all?

One, your reading of that sutta passage involves a large number of unfounded suppositions.

Two, your reading of Nāgārjuna conflates relative and ultimate. What Nagārjuna opines is the idea that the effects of actions are "imperishable", even after the action itself has ceased. In other words, he presents the āvipraṇāśa, his preferred theory. This chapter is sole place in the whole of the MMK where he expressed an preference of opinions.

Now, you might personally feel that Karma and dependent origination are in contradiction, but it is slipshod to invoke Nāgārjuna in defense of your theory, since Nāgārjuna, strictly speaking, ultimately negates arising altogether.

It all comes down to evidence. You can contest anything, but in the absence of evidence it means nothing.

Malcolm wrote:
And you can propose anything, even an anachronism, but in the absence of evidence it means nothing.

As far as Jayravava's article goes, there is a least one instance of playing fast and loose with the facts. He writes:
Indrajala said:
I've also discussed the contradictory biographical traditions in the suttas (see The Buddha's Biography). There are at least two biographies of the Buddha. In one he is a unmarried youth when he leaves home and his mother is still alive. In another he is a man of 29 whose mother died in childbirth. The youth is found in the Pāli version of the Ariyapariyesana Sutta and the 29 year old in the Chinese counterpart of the same text. Both stories cannot be true and we have no objective way of knowing which is. All we have is a general historical principle that Buddhist stories become more elaborate over time (there is clear evidence of this in the accurately dated Chinese translations). Thus, we usually assume that a less elaborate version of a story is (relatively) earlier than the same story in a more elaborate version.

Malcolm wrote:
However, this is incorrect. There is no specific mention of Buddha's mother in this sutta. There is this, however:

Indrajala said:
"So, at a later time, while still young, a black-haired young man endowed with the blessings of youth in the first stage of life — and while my parents, unwilling, were crying with tears streaming down their faces — I shaved off my hair & beard, put on the ochre robe and went forth from the home life into homelessness.

Malcolm wrote:
For example, my father remarried, and has a wife who is not my mother. But I often refer to them as my "parents" out of convenience, though only one of them is actually my parent.

Thus, when Jayarava claims that there are two conflicting bios in the canon, when his claim is closely examined, it is at best a reach based on how he wants to read the term "parents" and "youth". Thus, Jayarava is conjuring up contradictions where none are to be seen, in this case.

Then there is this:

Indrajala said:
There is the fundamental incompatibility of karma and pratītyasamutpāda. The former demands effects long after conditions have ceased, and the latter forbids it.

It seems though the popular calendar commonly used by Tibetans is very similar to the Chinese lunar calendar. Losar for example just happened, whereas Caitra or Vaiśākha, which are regarded as the start of the year on the Indian calendar, won't be until April or May.

According to Henning's site, there's multiple calendars in use:

http://www.kalacakra.org/calendar/tibcal.htm
However, the month commences from the new moon, as in the Chinese calendar you mention above.
There is a precedent for this in India. If I recall, the calendars of the south have the month commence from the new moon, which is called the amānta method, whereas if it commences from the full moon it is the pūrṇāmānta method. The amānta method is generally understood as occidental and not native to India originally.

Malcolm wrote:
The Tibetan calendar, while calculated astronomically on the basis of the Kālacakra (specifically the Vimalaprabha), is applied according to the system of 'byung rtsi, i.e. elemental calculation, which originates some time in the 11th century and derives from "China", roughly speaking.

There are two main systems of calendar making in Tibet, Phuglug and Tshurlug; the former is followed by most Tibetans; the latter, by the Karma Kagyu. The Tshurlug new year is one month earlier than the Phuglug system.

Does anyone know if Tibet ever used the Indian calendar based on the 27 or 28 nakṣatras? The month commences from the full moon and has its name derived from which nakṣatra the full moon is nominally abiding in that night. On the Chinese lunar calendar this would be day 15 (day 1 is the new moon). According to this model, the new year will commence on April 3rd or lunar 2/15, which is always the nakṣatra Citrā (as a month name it is Caitra).

If you convert the Chinese lunar calendar into the Indian one used by Amoghavajra in the eighth century it looks like this:

Q: is there any mention of liberated ones recalling their original or first birth ?

Seems a bit judgmental, particularly in regard to Mexico, which is a culture in wildly barbaric disarray whose government sends and deliberately encourages its poorest, least educated citizens to illegally immigrate to the U.S., to the detriment of both cultures, but especially of the U.S., whose resources are inadequate to handle these waves of illegal colonization. To dismiss the U.S. simply as "the lower 48 barbarism" is inaccurate and itself looks like a form of barbarism.

In Buddhism, any surrender is only expedient and temporary.  The final goal is liberation from all dependencies, i.e., true independence.  And you take your place as a Victorious One and become a source of refuge for others who have yet to achieve liberation.

In Abrahamic religions, surrender is absolute and eternal, and any free will you have is subject to the free will of Big Daddy.

Jeff said:
Where do you come up with that? Remember the most high is not some Zeus like old man. A couple of actual quotes from the bible for you...

Psalms 82:5-6
5They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course. 6I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the most High.

John 14:10-12
10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? The words that I speak to you I do not speak on My own authority; but the Father who dwells in Me does the works. 11 Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me, or else believe Me for the sake of the works themselves. 12 “Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes in Me, the works that I do he will do also; and greater works than these he will do, because I go to My Father.

Sherab said:
Christians like to claim that the creator is beyond space and time.  Since the created are created within space and time, the created will always be lower than the creator.  If you think that you can be equal to the creator, your Christian friends will think that you have come under the influence of Satan.  So Big Daddy still rules over you whether you like it or not.  Your free will is an illusion.

In Buddhism, the belief in a Creator God is considered as irrational.  The Buddha himself taught that there is no Creator God.  The Buddha taught that the Creator God is deluded in thinking that he (the Creator God) is a creator of the world and the beings therein.

When we follow the path shown by the Buddha, we will one day become Buddha ourselves.  We will become equal to the teacher, Buddha.  We will be truly free and independent.

Dropping anger and fear gives one control; becoming free of the three afflictions gives one the eight kinds of mastery.

When one takes refuge in the Buddha, one is not giving oneself over or surrendering to the Buddha. One is recognizing that Buddha alone shows the path to liberation.

When one takes refuge in the Aryasangha, one is recognizing that the Aryasangha alone can aid one on the path to liberation.

Can you tell me which Tibetan word is used for "surrender"? I have never encountered it used in a Tibetan or Indian Dharma book and I have read thousands.

I don't read basic Dharma texts in English very often anymore, though I do recall from when I did that Trungpa was definitely into the concept of surrender. I think those Tibetans like their Western students to "surrender"; but I think it has a bit more to do with the Cakravartin model of defeating and then converting people to the Dharma.

There is an idea of entrusting oneself (gtad pa) to the Three Jewels or the Guru, but that is a bit different in my view.

For example, when I entrust my money to a bank for safe keeping I do not surrender to the banker. When I entrust myself to the Three Jewels or my guru for the shelter of refuge, I am not surrendering to them. When someone "surrenders" they are placing themselves at the mercy of another. That is not how I understand my relationship with the Three Jewels nor my Gurus — that is a despotic model, quite common in Christianity, Judaism and Islam, and perhaps even Hinduism, but I think it is pretty foreign to Buddhadharma, no matter what Tulku Urgyen and Tsoknyi Rinpoche translators may have said when translating for them.

Here's a summary from an LA Times review of the book:
Jung was profoundly anti-Semitic. The facts concerning his thorough-going prejudice against Jews has become one of the most contentious issues in Jungian scholarship today. McLynn addresses it clearly and straightforwardly. In explaining how some analysts deal with Jung's collaboration with the Nazis, he writes that others "in a kind of version of 'politics should have nothing to do with sport,' say that it is beyond the competence of a psychotherapist, even one of genius, to decide on what is right and wrong in politics,and that Jung followed the correct therapeutic procedure in trying to remain above the fray. But the issue of the society [Society For Psychotherapy, of which Jung was president] and the journal [Zentralblatt, the journal sympathetic to Nazi policies edited by Jung] will not go away. Many of the post-1934 articles in the Zentralblatt go far beyond routine Swiss bourgeois anti-Semitism and contain virulent attacks on the Jews coupled with eulogies of Hitler [while he was still in power]. . . . Jung knew all about the later articles and did nothing. Since he could not claim ignorance, as these articles were edited in Switzerland, he tried after World War II, to shift the blame onto C.A. Maier [his deputy editor], claiming that he did all the editing."

McLynn paints an even darker picture of Jung's Nazi sympathies when he discovered that "in 1936 Jung threatened resignation as president [of the Society For Psychotherapy] when the Dutch tried to prevent Nazi sympathizers joining the society. As a calculated snub to his critics, in the same year he appointed Hermann Goering as co-editor of the Zentralblatt. . . . "

In other words, Saraha was the person who first promulgated Cakrasamvara among humans in this epoch and so all lineages of Cakrasamvara practice must in some way or another trace their lineage to him directly or indirectly.

This false consequence is often bandied about, but it is not convincing. Why is this so?

1) What is awakening? It is the direct perception of suchness, the dharmadhātu, etc. This is the direct cause of buddhahood. When that suchness is directly perceived (first bhumi, etc.), it is no longer possible to return to a state of ignorance about it just as a seed singed by fire can no longer produce a sprout.
Although it appears to be, a seed is not an unchanging entity. After a long time, it may lose the ability to germinate, besides, it only becomes a sprout under certain conditions, water,appropriate soil and light. However, if the sprout is really a 'result', then why it is not static and can grow into a plant or tree? On the other hand, if you throw the seed on fire; it becomes dust. The dust, in turn, continues an interdependent transformation process.

Malcolm wrote:

Causality does not exist because of interdependence. Interdependence exists because of causality.


Vajrasvapna said:
And wisdom itself burns the stains of the luminous mind as in this quote attributed to Nagarjuna explains: Just as the stains on a fireproof cloth
That is sullied by various stains
Are consumed when the cloth is placed in fire
While the cloth itself is not,
Likewise the stains of the luminous mind
Are consumed in the fire of wisdom;
They are not luminous.
All the sutras on emptiness
Taught by the Victor
Counteract negative emotions;
They do not harm that element [of luminosiry].

Malcolm wrote:
And this luminous mind to which Nāgārjuna (maybe, since the Dharmadhātustava is a very late text and is unattested in the Madhyamaka texts even as late as Candrakīrti and Śantarakṣita) refers, is this itself relative or ultimate? In any case, regardless of your answer, the same text observes:

When one is free from the snare of afflictions
in essenceless samsara, 
because of that there is buddhahood,
which turns into the ambrosia of all embodied beings.
 
In the same way, from all seeds
arise a result that resembles the cause,
what wise person would be able to prove
there is a fruit without a seed?

So, on the contrary, "Nāgārjuna" argues in this text that indeed buddhahood arises from causes. He further says:

Just as without a seed of sugar cane, 
sugar cannot be produced. 
When someone tends the sugar cane seed,
from proximity and effort, 
molasses, sugar, and refined sugar
will arise from that,
Having tended bodhicitta,
from proximity and effort
there is arhatship, the realization of conditions, (i.e. pratyekabuddhahood) and buddhahood
arising and produced from that.

So you believe that the alaya is a truly existing entity, since it is the cause of enlightenment?

The text of the Diamond sutra states that bodhisattva accumulate merit with detached actions, keeping their minds free of concepts of a truly existing entity. Although the text of the Diamond sutra does not say it directly, what is implied is that the Buddha body of merit is already present, the sambhogakaya; so actually the bodhisattva not accumulate any merit. An example, if you have a covered sculpture, the fact that you go slowly discovering the sculpture does not mean that the body of the sculpture was not already there. So bodhisattva will gradually revealing the body of merit already present.

Malcolm wrote:
Is Buddhahood a state one realizes, or a phenomena one passively observes? If Buddhahood is something that already exists within a sentient being, there is no reason for the experience of samsara. The Uttaratantra is very profound, but understood incorrectly, it is results on one adopting a tīrthika view of atman. Viewed another way, it becomes a definitive teaching on the nature of reality. It really depends on how it is understood.

Omniscience has causes and conditions. Even you admit it this in your example. Reality is already there, but unless one removes obscurations to perceiving it, it will never be perceived. Reality is not buddhahood. Buddhahood is the result of seeing reality fully.

2) Second, the state of perfect buddhahood, unsurpassed perfect complete awakening (anuttarasamyaksambodhi) is itself defined through the eradication of the two obscurations: the afflictive obscuration and the knowledge obscuration. When these two are eradicated it is not possible for someone to possess them again. Even if their consciousness remains a relative conditioned entity, it is a pure relative conditioned entity characterized by unimpeded knowledge of unconditioned reality. The mind, a conditioned relative entity, does not disappear at buddhahood. If it did, that would be nihilism; nor does it turn into an unconditioned entity itself, because that would involve a contradiction in kind — a conditioned entity cannot become an unconditioned entity and vice versa — as well as eliminating the possibility that there is a continuum between a sentient being and Vajradhara. This is the reason that Sachen Kungpa Nyingpo states in his Nyagma when defining the alāya cause continuum:
"Tantra", because it is the garland of self-knowing from a sentient being through buddhahood, the uninterrupted awareness of the mind itself.
Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen further notes on this passage:
Because all concepts and suffering are complete in the meaning of ālaya, it is the cause continuum.

I think the Saraha quote is pretty definitive, irregardless of what Jackson would like to believe.

dzogchungpa said:
Yeah, that Jackson is a real nut. Again, from his introduction: If there is a type of negation in Saraha, Kanha, and Tilopa that seems rather less mitigated by paradox or multiple levels of discourse, it is that related to the three siddhas’ attitudes toward social and religious convention, which are aptly summarized by Groucho Marx’s famous claim, in Horse Feathers, “Whatever it is, I’m against it.” In all three collections of dohas, but especially those of Saraha, there hardly is an Indian personage or practice of social or religious importance that is not subjected to mockery or critique. In the first fifteen verses of his Treasury, Saraha takes on, in succession, brahmin ritualists (S1–2), who are denounced for their pointless recitations and sacrifices; mendicant ascetics (S3–5), who are mocked for their deceit, hypocrisy, and greed; Jain renouncers (S6–9), who are ridiculed for their obsession with physical austerities; Buddhist monastics (S10), who are chastised for their dress-up games, their intellectualism, and their attempt to desiccate the mind through meditation; Mahayanists (S11), who are described as sophists and verbal gymnasts; tantrikas (S11, 14), who are said to be obsessed with mantras, mandalas, and mystic initiations  and practitioners of all kinds (S14–15) who are lampooned for believing that offering lamps or food, going on pilgrimage, or immersing themselves in sacred rivers can purify them of defilement. In other places, Saraha criticizes the self-deception of the alchemists (S51), the absurdities of devoted meditators (S19–20, 22–23, 33, etc.) and the pretensions of scholars (S68, 76, 93) and makes evident his distaste for distinguishing pure and impure on the basis of caste (S46, 56b). Saraha also repeatedly addresses his listener as a “fool” and refers disparagingly to “bestial” or “childish” people who simply don’t understand what is right in front of them. In a similar vein, but less extensively, Kanha and Tilopa, at various points in their dohas, criticize intellectuals (T8), scholars of sacred literature (K1, 29), people who make offerings to deities and visit pilgrimage spots (T19–21), and tantric ritualists obsessed with “chants, oblations, / and mandala rites” (K29). The social and religious outlook of all three is perhaps best captured in Saraha’s injunction: “Throw off / conventional nonsense” (S55).

Speaking of "Tantric Treasures", here's a passage from Jackson's Introduction: The figures found in these lists are generally acknowledged to be “Buddhists.” Certainly, the legends surrounding them and the words attributed to them have influenced countless Buddhists in India, Nepal, and Tibet for a thousand years; but in their original setting, it is not always easy to separate them out—whether in terms of terminology, rhetoric, or practice—from similar figures in non-Buddhist, especially “Hindu” traditions. They seem quite closely related to Saivite ascetics like the Pasupatas and Kapalikas; tantrikas like the Kashmiri Saivas and Bengali Saktas; or the wonder-working Nath siddhas and Rasa siddhas. More broadly, there are general similarities between ideas and practices found in Buddhist siddha writings and those of other Indian yogic and ascetic communities—from such “textualized” movements as those reflected in the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali and the Samnyasa Upanisads to such seemingly timeless and “unwritten” groups as the Nagas, Kanphatas, and Aghoras. Nor can their possible connections with similar sorts of groups in, for instance, Persia, central Asia, or China be overlooked; the resonance, and possible historical connections, between Indian siddhas and Chinese Chan masters or Taoist immortals suggest an especially intriguing, if uncertain, path for further research. What is more, it is entirely possible that, as suggested long ago by Agehanada Bharati, most of the siddhas actually were pre- or nonsectarian wandering yogins, who appropriated various religious terms without intending to promote a particular religion—yet willy-nilly were appropriated by those very sectarian traditions that they resisted or ignored.

What are the spiritual goals of Buddhadharma?

Mahayana Buddhism = Bodhisattva
Advaita Vedanta = Stop reincarnating

The spiritual goal of Mahāyāna Buddhadharma is buddhahood, the attainment of the three kāyas. Bodhisattvas are those who strive for this goal in order to liberate all beings from samsara. In the process, all afflictions that cause rebirth in samsara are eliminated and power over birth is attained at the eighth bhumi.

From the point of view of Buddhadharma, Advaitans never achieve cessation of rebirth because they do not eradicate the innate clinging to atman, therefore, no matter how profound their samadhi or understanding may be, it is not a cause of freedom from samsara, and at best they attain rebirth in the unconsciousness deva realms.

Boomerang said:
I agree with that. To put it another way, I feel that Hinduism is like an alternate form of the Sravaka path, the difference being that they don't follow Buddha's teachings. So I think Advaita Vedanta is valid the same way Theravada Buddhism is valid.

It is good that you noticed that relative bodhicitta is absolutely lacking in the Hindu path. Second, you only need to understand ultimate bodhicitta is lacking in the Hindu path, and once having understood that, you will understand why even Advaita will not lead to cessation of rebirth, thus rendering it lower than Hinayāna Buddhism, which does lead to the cessation of [afflictive] rebirth.

Malcolm wrote:
The spiritual goal of Mahāyāna Buddhadharma is buddhahood, the attainment of the three kāyas. Bodhisattvas are those who strive for this goal in order to liberate all beings from samsara. In the process, all afflictions that cause rebirth in samsara are eliminated and power over birth is attained at the eighth bhumi.

From the point of view of Buddhadharma, Advaitans never achieve cessation of rebirth because they do not eradicate the innate clinging to atman, therefore, no matter how profound their samadhi or understanding may be, it is not a cause of freedom from samsara, and at best they attain rebirth in the unconsciousness deva realms.

Ayu said:
For the sake of understanding better this topic, I asked a tibetan buddhist novice nun (from Austria) yesterday.
She said, no, there are not different rules in Theravada and Mahayana - at least not to an considerable extent. The reasons why all the tibetan monks and nuns are eating dinner, for example, or wearing sweaters under their robes in winter and all this, are individually. Some have exeption because of health issues, or other reasons.
Mainly you can see that the rules are accomodated to the certain circumstances.
For sure these ordained confess regularly and hold the right view to the best of their capacity.

In my point of view this doesn't reduce the respect they deserve to the slightest.


Malcolm wrote:
Yes, there are different rules, Theravadins do not have a system of Mahāyāna ordination, Tibetan Buddhism does; Thervada does not have a system of Vajrayāna vows, Tibetan Buddhism does. The receipt of these higher vows alters how the lower vows are practiced. Please Sapan's Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes or Kontgrul's Buddhist Ethics.

What you seem to be failing to understand is that if you have gone for refuge to the Buddha, you have eschewed other refuges. If you go for refuge to other gods having once gone for refuge to the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, you void your refuge in the Three Jewels including losing all the vows that come with going for refuge, you return to the state of a ordinary person, and the virtue that you perform is no longer elevated by refuge in the Three Jewels.

Buddhadharma is a path, and aside from the fact of whether the goals of Buddhadharma and Sanatana Dharma are the same(they're not),  one cannot tread two paths at the same time. One must walk on one or the other. One cannot walk on both. It would be very much like trying to stand on two horses at the same time.

Hell.

However, you do realize that if you are practitioner [and in general all Tibetan monks are], you confess all your misdeeds and downfalls of the three vows daily with Vajrasattva?

Moreover, the bodhisattva approach to following the vows can be flexible as the Buddha states in the Ārya-vinayaviniścayopāliparipṛcchā-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:
The training of a bodhisattva who has entered into Mahāyāna is said to be modifiable. The training of those in the śravakayāna is said to unmodifiable.
This sūtra also clarifies other issues you seem to be obsessed with.

So again, while it is important to receive and maintain the three vows, the flexibility towards pratimokṣa vow in the Mahāyāna approach to the vows that is not present in the Hinayāna approach to the pratimokṣa vow, in addition to the fact that Mahāyāna vows constitute a separate and more important class of vows, even while taking the pratimokṣa vows as a foundation.

So, as a monk or even layperson it is actually quite risky, if you really believe in the words of the vinaya, to suggest that "Mahāyāna Bhikṣus needn't be so concerned with these details, since their motivation for practice is more important that adhering to this or that rule."

Malcolm wrote:
As Nagolo Khenchen states in his The Lamp of the Path of Freedom and Omniscience:
Therefore, even though one takes life and does not practice celibacy, such actions can be permissible, but engaging in these actions for one’s own benefit through desire, hatred and confusion is not permitted for anyone. Likewise, making offerings to the Three Jewels and making donations to beggars by stealing the property of the greedy, lying in order to protect sentient beings against being killed and so on, calumny to separate others from nonvirtuous friends, using harsh speech to place those in the Dharma with forceful methods who cannot be swayed with gentle speech, protesting hidden flaws by giving instruction and so on, are permitted.
As I said, the general POV in Tibetan Buddhism is that the ten nonvirtues are permissible if they are to benefit others.

Indrajala said:
So, you state, "One's abiding in a state of virtue or non-virtue derived from receiving any of the three vows is not dependent upon whether anyone else knows about it or not. It is dependent upon whether or not one has taken proper efforts to guard one's vows carefully." However, the whole meaning of "guarding one's vows" and what exactly that is supposed to require is a topic with many diverse opinions historically, and some positions would suggest being incorrect is literally going to send you to hell (wrong view and all that).

Basically, most people just make up their own mind on such issues regardless of what scriptures and Buddhist theorists say, and hope to get on in life.

Malcolm wrote:
In his discussion of the pratimokṣa vows of Mahāyāna system, Sapan states:
Here, these observances that are concerned
with the elements of evil and unwholesomeness
are mostly kept as in the Disciple's system,
while certain desireless offenses are treated 
in accord with that of bodhisattvas.

Behavior that, in the view both systems,
would cause worldlings to lose faith
is strenuously guarded against; a lapse
is allowed in the Individual Liberation discipline
if the Great Vehicle if it induces worldings to virtue.
-- Rhoton, 2002, SUNY, pg. 46.

In other words, bhikṣus eating dinner is not an issue for a Tibetan Buddhist monastery. Handling gold and money is not an issue as long as it is for the benefit of the Dharma, so on and so forth.

Nevertheless, the act of receiving the three vows in itself is a virtue, and one should endeavor as best one can to uphold the three vows, and purify one's downfalls immediately and daily. This is how we practice vowed conduct in Tibetan Buddhism. I don't really care how they do it in other schools, but this question was posed in the Tibetan Buddhist forum.

Malcolm wrote:
I never entertained the notion that followers of Buddhadharma should not learn from teachers of other schools. While we have a rich analysis of the tenets of others schools, sometimes they seem a little like parodies of them. So it is useful to hear a Yoga master teach on Samkhya and Yoga, an Advaita master teach on Advaita and so on. Nevertheless, one does this in order to understand how these tenets are different from Buddhadharma, in addition to understanding their commonalities.

For example, I myself spent six weeks learning Yoga, the Yoga Sutras, Samkhya and so on from a well respected disciple of Krishnamacarya a couple of years ago. It was a valuable experience because now I can say that I really understand the system of the Yoga Sūtras, Samkhya, and so on, and how they are distinct from Buddhadharma. To study with a tīrthika teacher is not the same as going for for refuge in something other than Buddhadharma. As bodhisattvas, we are supposed to study everything, particularly adhyatmyavidyā, the inner sciences. Of course, the classical inner sciences in Dharma are Prajñāpāramita, Madhyamaka and so on, but we can also consider the study of non-=Buddhist tenet systems to be part of that study. Of course there is a danger, if one is not discerning, that one will become confused  — but as long as one is clear about where one's refuge lies, there there will not be a problem in the end.

I see no evidence at all from anything that Ramana said or wrote that his view is anything other than stock Hinduism of the Advaitan variety. I have no doubt he was a remarkable person, but at this point, since he died 65 years ago, longer than most of us have been alive, why would I accept anything that anyone says about him that differs from what is found in his texts?

I guess I do not understand what is profound in Ramana's teachings. I find the Buddha profound, I find Nāgārjuna profound, etc. But when I read the works of Hindu masters I always find them to be a bit off in one regard or another. So, admittedly, I find it really hard to understand why people who have been introduced to the teachings of Buddhadharma find Ramana profound.

Seriously, I find Vasubandhu more profound that Ramana. In the case of Dzogchen, it is particularly hard to understand why people find Advaita profound given that Śankara is named in the Rig pa rang shar tantra among the sixty wrong views to be rejected, and given that Advaita is refuted in Santarakṣita's Tattvasamgraha and so on.

For some people's karmic imprints, they will be attracted to these other traditions in this life. . if in dialogue with them, we make aggressive and bombastic claims of their tradition being inferior, or negative, etc. they may develop negative impressions of the Buddhadharma which would be bad imprints for them to carry in future lives. If we are more open and generous, but still honest and clear, they may have positive impressions that could lead them to the Dharma more readily in this or future lives.

Malcolm wrote:
I have not belittled anything. I have merely pointed out that the ideas and notions about liberation and freedom between Hinduism and Buddhism are not even slightly commensurable.

For example, if you have a mountain in the east, and another in the west, do you tell someone that by climbing a mountain in the east, they will ascend the same peak as the mountain in the west?

All I have said is that Hinduism and Buddhism have a different basis, therefore the path is different and the result is different. I have not instructed anyone which mountain they should climb — merely that one cannot climb two mountains at once, and also that one cannot expect to reach the peak of one mountain by climbing another.

On another note, this article is interesting re: Jigten Sumgön’s views on 'outsider' traditions: http://dgongs1.com/2015/01/21/one-for-t ... mophobics/
Jigten Sumgön’s general approach to spiritual views, conducts, and practices is one that attempts to perceive something in terms of what its nature is. In this sense he acknowledges that (1.19) there exists much that is virtuous by nature to be practised in [the systems of] the non-Buddhists too. This stands in contrast to a general opinion according to which “the complete view, conduct, and practise of the non-Buddhists is only something to be abandoned.”

One of Jigten Sumgön’s most basic positions is simply that whatever is virtuous by nature has a joyful result. Such virtue, however, is not confined to the realm of Buddhism alone. As he had pointed out in vajra-statement 1.1, the Buddha did not “invent” his own Dharma, but revealed the ultimate true nature as it is — and that nature exists as it is, independent of whether someone reveals it or not. Therefore, whoever acts in accordance with that nature will receive the respective appropriate results, no matter whether that person is a Buddhist or not, or whether that person has realised “the definite meaning that perceives the truth” or not. In fact, Rigdzin Chökyi Dragpa explains that even animals will enjoy the joyful fruits if they are “temporary [in] possession of … virtuous things to be practised,” such as loving kindness for their offspring.

Ramana's statement was not qualified. It was a blanket assertion "Silence (of whatever kind) is the perfect upadesha...", and since this is clearly a defective statement, I don't agree with it. It had no context, unlike the silence of Vimalakirti — whose silence was an answer itself.

anjali said:
Ramana's statement had context, I just didn't provide it. The context is the guru-disciple relationship, and the highest "teaching" of a realized master.

It's from Talks with Ramana Maharshi: Talk 569. Specfically, the quote is from discussion about the Dakshinamurti Stotra, Brahma's four sons (who were seekers) and Siva (as their guru). They desired guidance for realisation of the Self. They were the best equipped individuals for Self-Realisation. Guidance should be only from the best of Masters. Who could it be but Siva - the yogiraja. Siva appeared before them sitting under the sacred banyan tree. Being yogiraja should He practise yoga? He went into samadhi as He sat; He was in Perfect Repose. Silence prevailed. They saw Him. The effect was immediate. They fell into samadhi and their doubts were at an end.

Silence is the true upadesa. It is the perfect upadesa. It is suited only for the most advanced seeker. The others are unable to draw full inspiration from it. Therefore they require words to explain the Truth. But Truth is beyond words. It does not admit of explanation. All that is possible to do is only to indicate It.
To provide additional context regarding silence (Talk 231): Silence is never-ending speech. Vocal speech obstructs the other speech of silence. ... The silence of Dakshinamurti removed the doubts of the four sages. Mouna vyakhya prakatita tatvam (Truth expounded by silence.) Silence is said to be exposition. Silence is so potent. For vocal speech, organs of speech are necessary and they precede speech. But the other speech lies even beyond thought. It is in short transcendent speech or unspoken words, para vak.
Also Silence is ever-speaking; it is a perennial flow of language; it is interrupted by speaking. These words obstruct that mute language. There is electricity flowing in a wire. With resistance to its passage, it glows as a lamp or revolves as a fan. In the wire it remains as electric energy. Similarly also, silence is the eternal flow of language, obstructed by words. What one fails to know by conversation extending to several years can be known in a trice in Silence, or in front of Silence - e.g., Dakshinamurti, and his four disciples. That is the highest and most effective language.
Of course, you probably don't care what Ramana has to say on the subject of silence. The point of all this was that the silence of a realized master is the best of upadesas for disciples who can hear it.

No doubt. The knowing silence of a Buddha is not the ignorant silence of a sentient being. From what I can tell, you don't take issue with the words per se of the quote by Ramana on silence, but with how they are understood?

Vimalakirti's knowing silence was an answer to Manjushri's question, and was therefor a teaching. From a certain perspective, Vimalakiri's silence is the true and direct upadesa, as all other verbal teachings merely point to that knowing silence. Also, Vimalakirti's silence was the only answer that could be considered free of fault or defect. ("If you open your mouth, you are mistaken.") Thus, Vimalakirti's knowing silence is the perfect upadesa.

By way of comparison, here is an exchange between Vivekananda and Ramakrishna, who are as "Hindu" as it gets: NARENDRA [Vivekananda] (to a disciple present:) ""Worldly people, who are engrossed in sense-objects, say that everything exists— asti. But the Mayavadis, the illusionists, say that nothing exists— nasti. The experience of a Buddha is beyond both 'existence' and 'non-existence'
RAMAKRISHNA: "This 'existence' and 'non-existence' are attributes of Prakriti. The Reality is beyond both."

Malcolm wrote:
What Ramakrishna says above is a pure Advaitan spin on Samkhya. He is referring here to the Advaitan interpretation of Purusha, aka Brahmin.

So no, Ramakrishna does not "get it", as it were. There is no reality beyond the extremes of existence and non-existence, and this of course is the meaning of the famed silence of Vimalakirti in the non-duality chapter:

When the bodhisattvas had given their explanations, they all addressed the crown prince Manjusri: "Manjusri, what is the bodhisattva's entrance into nonduality?"
Manjusri replied, "Good sirs, you have all spoken well. Nevertheless, all your explanations are themselves dualistic. To know no one teaching, to express nothing, to say nothing, to explain nothing, to announce nothing, to indicate nothing, and to designate nothing - that is the entrance into nonduality."

Then the crown prince Manjusri said to the Licchavi Vimalakirti, "We have all given our own teachings, noble sir. Now, may you elucidate the teaching of the entrance into the principle of nonduality!"

Thereupon, the Licchavi Vimalakirti kept his silence, saying nothing at all.
As we can see, this passage reflects the Buddha's teaching on the inexpressibility cited in the Sutta Nipata.

Further, the Samputa Tantra states:
Not empty, not non-empty, 
there is also nothing to perceive in the middle.
Thus we can see that Ramakrishna's statement does not correspond to the Buddha's teaching.

The nonduality (brahman) realized by Advaitans is not the same nonduality (śūnyatā) realized in Buddhadharma. Brahman and śūnyatā are not the same thing at all. Advaitans such as Shankara reject śūnyatā completely, as well as rejecting dependent origination and so on.
The concept of Advaita's nonduality is not the same as Buddhism's concept of nonduality. It's wise for a teacher to discourage a student from mixing both together. Mixing them would likely lead to confusion. Still, none of this has any bearing on nonduality itself. Nonduality is beyond "this is" and "this is not," like those scriptures I quoted earlier say.

Malcolm wrote:
There is no "nonduality" that stands alone by itself, somewhere else, or even here.

As I said before, "nondual" is a technical term in Buddhadharma that has many uses. Principally speaking, it refers to an individual's state of consciousness free from subject and object or it refers to the absence of relative dualities such as samsara/nirvana, being/nonbeing, pure/impure, nondual/dual, etc. In the latter case, this absence of dualities itself is predicated on emptiness free from extremes.

Even so, nonduality is a meaningless expression without reference to plurality, so even nonduality cannot bear analysis. For this reason Nāgārjuna, when commenting on his Praise of the Three Kāyas states when commenting on this line, "Not one, not many, becoming the basis for the very abundant benefit of myself and others."
For "not one, not many...." and so on, one and many means one and many i.e., both are nondual. Many means plural. Conventionally speaking "I prostate" to that which is the dharmakāya, neither one nor many. If it is asked "For what reason do we say though it is not one, it is also not many?" Due to that, since it is said "non-arisen from the beginning", that which never arose from the beginning cannot have a phase of being one or many; like space, its nature is completely uninterrupted. Since all phenomena arise in the same way, therefore, what arises where? That which becomes a form of diversity is not seen by anyone, i.e. just as grains of rice arise from rice seed, likewise, whatever arises from emptiness is not permanent nor annihilated. Why? Free of all concepts, the victors see that to be empty and illusory.
The point I am trying to get you to understand is that "nonduality" spoken of by the Buddha, Nāgārjuna, Asanga and so on is nothing like the nonduality spoken of by Shankara, etc. Now of course, many speculate — on the basis of Gaudapada's Agamasaśtra's fourth section — that Shankara was influence by Mahāyāna Buddhism. If so, Shankara sure spends a lot of time in his commentary on the Brahma Sutras trying to prove that he is not influenced by Mahāyāna.

In the above comment, an important point must no be overlooked. Here Nāgārjuna is equating all phenomena's mode of arising with the mode of arising of the non-arisen dharmakāya — which is to say that phenomena do not arise. It is the perception of the nonarising of phenomena which leads to the ultimate attainment of the dharmakāya. That perception of the nonarising of phenomena is the perception of emptiness.

Moreover, Nāgārjuna invokes the principle of likeness of causes and effects — i.e. just as rice arises from rice seed, likewise, just as emptiness is neither permanent or annihilated, whatever arise from emptiness is neither permanent or annihilated, the Buddhas perceive that to be empty and illusory, without any vikalpa, conceptuality or imagination.

There is no permanent substrate which accounts for the arising of phenomena ultimately, and relatively, all phenomena arise because of cause and conditions  —dependent origination — rather than from a creative principle such as Iśvara and so on.

Then of course there is also the fact that Advaita heavily depends on Saṃkhya, the Saṃkya notion of purusha as we can see in the Tattvabodhi and other texts, this is yet another reason why the principle of nonduality in Buddhadharma and Advaita are not commensurable and so do not lead the same realization.

Maybe I should clarify. The reason I think Advaita Vedanta and Mahayana Buddhism's systems are somewhat compatible is that Mahayana Buddhism has the concept of Buddha-nature. I've given some quotations that show similarity between descriptions of Buddha-nature and of the self in Advaita.

Of course you can say that understandings of the term "nondual" are not commensurable. "Nondualism" in Buddhadharma is predicated on dependent origination.

I read a scientific paper on people who've had non-symbolic realizations in a variety of traditions. The study showed that people who have only had one realization tend to be dogmatic, and view their realization as the ultimate and only true enlightenment. The first realization gives you a grounded feeling like you've seen the most real reality there could ever be. For people who have had several realizations, that feeling of certainty gets blown out the water, and in turn, they are more open-minded to different theories of enlightenment.

One of the most challenging issues facing Theravada Buddhism in recent years has been the encounter between classical Theravada vipassana meditation and the "non-dualistic" contemplative traditions best represented by Advaita Vedanta and Mahayana Buddhism. Responses to this encounter have spanned the extremes, ranging from vehement confrontation all the way to attempts at synthesis and hybridization. While the present essay cannot pretend to illuminate all the intricate and subtle problems involved in this sometimes volatile dialogue, I hope it may contribute a few sparks of light from a canonically oriented Theravada perspective.

Is Buddhist nonduality something that humans are able to perfectly describe through language? Is Advaita nonduality something that humans can perfectly describe through language?

First of all, the way the term is used in Buddhadharma and Advaita are very different.

For example, the Tarkajvakla, a famous commentary on Nagarjuna 's MMK states:

Therefore, that which is the inner earth element, that is is the external earth element, that is the meaning of nondual.
Or:
When that yogin dwells in the experience of nonconceptual discerning wisdom [prajñā] and experiences nonduality, at that time, ultimately, the entire reality of objects of knowledge are as follows, of the same characteristics, like space, appearing in the manner of a nonappearance since their characteristics are nonexistent, therefore, there isn't even the slightest thing that is not empty, so where could there be emptiness? Since there are no mental discriminations, there is no conceptual clinging of mutual dependence."
Or the Kaumudī, a famous Buddhist tantric commentary, states:
Because of the absence of inherent existence, the nondual essence of all phenomena is emptiness.
It also is understood, as Dzogchungpa point outed, as a consciousness devoid of subject and object, as the Ḍākinīvajrapañjara[-mahā]tantrarājasya pañjikā[-prathamapaṭala-]mukhabandha-nāma
One is a nondual consciousness. 
Two is an apprehending subject and an apprehended object.
These quotes are not exhaustive, but they show that "nondual" in Buddhadharma is really quite different than Advaita.

Boomerang said:
Thank you for the quotations. Here's a quotation from one of my favorite Advaita websites. It's quite similar to your final one:

Reality is you, whole and complete non-dual consciousness. This is the essence of Vedanta’s teachings.

The ways Buddhism and Advaita use the term consciousness aren't exactly the same, but similarities like this are what I'm talking about when I say I can see the same nondual core in both religions. And that's why I'm Buddhist and Hindu. The two religions have more similarities than their attitude toward avidya. You clearly know much more about Buddhism than me, but I think I know more about Advaita than you. Otherwise you wouldn't have even used that last quotation, or made that earlier statement about Advaita positing absolute existence after I said existence and non-existence are mithya.

The way Advaita Vedanta works, a student will be taught a series of concepts which progressively introvert the mind. When one concept has done its job, it will be discarded and replaced by another. The student's mind becomes subtler and subtler until eventually all ignorance falls away and nonduality is realized. The people in this thread are picking out individual concepts that are used in the Advaita sadhana, and confusing them to be the whole system.

This non-conceptual Wisdom Mind is not the object of the conceptualizing process and so is not negated by Madhyamaka reasoning. Therefore, it can be said to be the only thing that has absolute and true existence.

Who inspires to discriminate between the real 'I' and its imagined, unreal meaning; who imparts direct knowledge of 'You are That' as said in Vedas to his dependents; without direct connection with whom, it is impossible to cross this ocean of birth and death, salutations to Sri Shiva in the form of preceptor.॥3॥

Who emanates from eyes and other sense organs like the light of a lamp kept in a vessel with multiple pores; by whose grace, I know that this light only illumines the entire world, salutations to Sri Shiva in the form of preceptor.॥4॥

Those who consider themselves as body, life force, sense organs, dynamic intelligence or nothing are deluded like women, kids, blinds and dull-minded. Who ends this great anxiety due to the play of Maya, salutations to Sri Shiva in the form of preceptor. ॥5॥

The unborn, unaware self is properly covered due to Maya like Sun and Moon eclipsed by Rahu. It shines forth once all barriers are removed. Who makes it realize that you are one with that slept self, salutations to Sri Shiva in the form of preceptor.॥6॥

Self is ever present in various stages of body like childhood, etc., various stages of mind like waking, etc. and unattached. Who always resonates like 'I am That', who reveals himself happily and beautifully on remembering, salutations to Sri Shiva in the form of preceptor. ॥7॥

Self sees this world in many forms of himself like action and cause, servant and owner, teach er and disciple, father and son, etc. By whose power, Maya; Self looks to be wandering in dream and waking, salutations to Sri Shiva in the form of preceptor.॥8॥

Whatever is seen in this moving and non-moving world is made up of eight forms of Shiva - Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Space, Sun, Moon and Self. On contemplation, there is nothing beyond him, salutations to all pervading Sri Shiva in the form of preceptor.॥9॥

'You are Self of all' is realized by your worship, listening about you, thinking over you, meditating and singing for you. You, the almighty God, are experienced with all your unstoppable grandeur, in eight forms. Salutations to Sri Shiva in the form of preceptor.॥10॥

but it a Great Madhyamaka

Malcolm wrote:
Mahāmadhyamaka is a term that has a complicated history. Gzhan stong does not have the trademark on it.

For example, Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen writes in his Great Song of Experience:
Freedom from extremes is beyond knowledge, expressions and objects, 
Madhyamaka, Cittamatra and so on,
expressions in words are proliferations...
That view of Great Madhyamaka
is bliss without delusion because it is not a proposition.
This was written 100 years before Dolbupa was even born. In fact the Gelugpas also refer to Lama Tsongkhapa's view as Great Madhyamaka and so on.

Of course, if you examine, you will find the early Nyingma, Kadampa, Sakya and Kagyu uses of the term more consistent with how the term is used in Indian texts. For example Atisha writes extensively about Mahāmadhyamaka. So what does he say? In his Bodhimārgapradīpapañjikā-nāma, his autocommentary on the Lamp of the Path of Awakening, the foundation text for all Lam Rim:
To explain the essence of Master Nāgārjuna's teaching, that is comprehended to be the great madhyamaka [dbu ma chen po] beyond existence and nonexistence, the meaning of Prajñāpāramitā, and it is also taught the same way in the texts of other scholars. As such, it is the intention of Guru Bodhibhadra, and Jetsun Kusulupa. That nectar of Ārya Nāgārjuna satisfied Āryadeva, Candrakīrti, Śantideva and Bodhibhadra, and a little of it was also sprinkled on me. With four great arguments all phenomena are proven to be nonarising —  one should abide in the philosophical conclusion of the great madhyamaka through following the masters of the past.
One never finds the term "great madhyamaka" being used by the Yogacara authors.

One place where the term is used, and I believe is in fact its origin, is that it is used frequently to describe the completion stage in tantric commentaries. But again, its description is not out of line with mainstream Indian Madhyamaka. For example, in the Śrīhevajranāmatantrārthasaṁgraha:
"After that, explain the meaning of the great madhyamaka free from all extremes...."
Or in the Śrīsaṁpuṭatilaka-nāma-yoginītantrarājasya ṭīkā-smṛitisaṁdarśanāloka-nāma:
"Full expansion of qualities" means buddhahood comes from Mantrayāna and great madhyamaka.
Or the Bhagavadd-hevajrasādhana-abhisamayakramārthaprasanna-nāma:
Meditate upon the great madhyamaka
free from all signs.
Or the Śrī-kālacakropadeśayogaṣaḍaṅgatantrapañjikā-nāma:
The nature of completion is called "great madhyamaka".
The Śrī-ḍākārṇavamahāyoginītantrarājasyaṭīkāvohitaṭikā-nāma:
"Madhyamaka" is the essential Dharma and the great Madhyamaka of the Mahāyāna free from the four extremes is the awakening of the fortunate.
Or the Samājābhisamayālaṁkāravṛtti:
Having manifested the great madhyamaka that is immaculate like space...
The Upadeśaniścaya-nāma-śrīguhyasamājavṛtti states:
The neutral recitation is meditating body, speech and mind in the state of great madhyamaka — beyond all extremes of signs, because it isn't anything at all, it is called "neutral".
The Āryamañjuśrīnāmasaṁgītiṭīkāsārābhisamaya states:
"Due to be being free it is like a reflection" — a mere reflection to which there is freedom from clingning, or even being free from the mere designation "reflection" is the great madhyamaka free from the four extremes. For which it is also said:

The diversity is not permanent,
nor is its annihilation proposed;
neither permanent nor annihilated,
also not both —
liberated from all four extremes
that is the reasoning of a mādhyamika.

[quote="smcjSince the transcendent (beyond cause and effect) Wisdom Mind is unborn and never comes into existence it is not subject to the same deconstruction and can be said to be real.
[/quote]

From a Madhyamaka perspective, something that never comes into existence is a nonexistent, and cannot be considered real by Madhyamaka definitions. It is therefore also not immune to Madhyamaka analysis. In this respect too, "wisdom mind" is no different than all the other phenomena that do not arise (which is all of them), and therefore are not real.

The classical  Tibetan refutation of gzhan stong is the Madhyamaka refutation of the unconditioned in the MMK:
If arising, abiding and perishing are not established, the conditioned is not established. 
If the condition has never been established, where will the unconditioned be established?
The classical Tibetan refutation of the charge of "rang stong" is the following statement from the MMK:
If there were some thing subtly not empty, there would be some thing to be empty, 
but as there is no thing that is not empty, where is there some thing to be empty?
Finally, the rejection of that the world has a nature:
Whatever is the nature of the tathāgata, that is the nature of the world.
As tathāgata has no nature, also the world has no nature.
In reality, following the opinion of Rongtong Sheja Kunrig, gzhan stong is a kind of transitional view between classical yogacara and madhyamaka, and is in fact little more than a variant of the false-aspectarian yogacara mainly promulgated by Ratnakarashanti.

When I spoke with Khenpo Tsultrim Gyatso, he did not admit, nor was I pressing the point, that Advaita and gzhan stong were identical: the point was that both systems were structurally similar only in that they asserted the relative was completely unreal and the ultimate completely real. Even though he agreed with this characterization, he strongly emphasized at that time that despite this similarity, Advaita does not have buddhahood as a result. I add this just so you are clear about what I asked, and what he replied.

The other thing that plagues gzhan stong is that unlike classical Indian Madhyamaka, of which two clear trends can be observed — gzhan stong, being largely a Tibetan innovation, has a plethora of interpretations.

Finally, as to the term "mahāmadhyamaka". As I have pointed out several times now, the earliest use the the term in a Tibetan text is by the Nyingma author Kawa Paltseg, the translator from the early 9th century. In his Explanation of The Stages of the View he refers to Mahāmadhyamaka as:
Freedom from the two extremes in the ultimate 
is asserted to be mahāmadhyamaka
The of course we have Naropa's statement in the Abbreviation of the View, translated by Marpa Lotsawa, which paraphrases the Hevajra Tantra:
That thing, samsara, 
that is nirvana, 
that is mahāmadhyamaka.
Now, I am  not very sure why some Kagyus have abandoned to view of Naropa and Marpa, but it sure seems that they have, because the above sentiment is impossible in gzhan stong, where nirvana is by definition empty of samsara, not identical with it.

I have heard it suggested that there is indeed more than one realization that can be appropriately called "nondual," and which feels absolutely final. The idea that "because they're both nondual, they are the same insight," or that they give rise to the same degree of freedom, is no longer so obvious to me.

For someone like me, the best way to evaluate whether two insights are the same, or whether one is "higher" than the other, is to ask people who feel that they've experienced both. For example, among people who have experience the insight that "I am a separate body in a world of other bodies," and "the world and I are one," nobody seems to consider the former a deeper insight. This gives me some confidence.

If there are people who have experienced both "all is Brahman" (or "there is only Brahman"), and "even Brahman is empty," then maybe I can learn something about which of those views is more "accurate" (despite the fact that this word itself means progressively less along the path). I have come across a few individuals (both from a Vedanta background and a Buddhist background) who supposedly have experienced both insights, and their thoughts about whether these insights are the same (and just being expressed from different angles), or one is more freeing, is informative to my practice.

I'd rather not share much about what I learned (for a few reasons), but thought I'd share that this was something interesting for me to investigate.

Malcolm wrote:
Ummm, no, not in Buddhadharma. The content of awakening is the same between a first stage bodhisattva and a buddha — the only things that differentiates the awakening of bodhisattvas and buddhas is that a bodhisattva still has obscurations of affliction and omniscience to remove, and a buddha does not. Otherwise, there is no difference in the emptiness they realize. They realize the same emptiness.

For this reason, for example, Maitreyanatha describes sentient beings, bodhisattvas and buddhas respectively as impure, impure/pure, and pure.

right direction, but which shouldn't be confused with the actual realization/destination
which is beyond the capacity of language (or conceptual mind) altogether?

I've heard that Hindus tend to fall away from the fruit in the direction of
Eternalism, and Buddhists in the direction of Nihilism.. Of course the proper
way of Buddhadharma is beyond either extreme.. But realistically, most of us here
are falling in one direction or another.. Let's take stock and look at this soberly.

Boomerang said:
That sums up my opinion. Once nonduality is realized, it becomes apparent that none of the conceptual tools used up to that point are inherently true or false. That's why I feel comfortable saying that Advaita Vedanta and Buddhism are both legitimate even though they disagree on various points. Nagarjuna and Shankara were both masters of skillful means.

Malcolm wrote:
"Nonduality" in Buddhdharma is the simple fact that the two predicates of things, "existence" and "nonexistence", are false. That is all and nothing more.

That is not how Shankaracarya understands "nonduality", which is that the nondual state is "one without a second", i.e. existent.

Given that this is so, "nonduality" in Buddhdharma and Advaita are not even remotely commensurate.

Those who think so either do not understand a) Buddhadharma b) Advaita c) Both. In general, it is usually Advaitans who do not understand Buddhadharma who make the mistake of equating the treatment of nonduality in Buddhadharma and Advaita. One thing is for sure ‚ the ancient Indian Buddhist masters were not confused about this distinction.

If these had been Brahmanical strongholds as you misunderstand them to be, then they would have used Sanskrit from the start. However, we find Buddhists using languages like Bactrian and Gāndhārī instead. There are inscriptions of refuge verses found in Bactrian fashion using Bactrian script:

“In the original mahamudra tradition, the earliest masters literally sang the disciples into enlightenment with poems called dohas.  The mind’s natural condition was directly pointed out by the master, who then gave instructions to negate any artificial activity during meditation.  Realization of the mind’s awakened wisdom was a consequence of these pointing-out and nonmeditation instructions.  This is ESSENCE MAHAMUDRA.

Later in the tradition, mahamudra practitioners first learned to refine the ordinary mind through mastering traditional generation-stage and completion-stage tantric practices, and then they took up mahamudra either concurrent with or following completion-stage practice.  This is TANTRIC MAHAMUDRA.

Still later in the tradition, practitioners first refined the ordinary mind through mastering standard concentration and special insight meditation, and after some degree of mastery had been achieved, mahamudra was then introduced.  This is SUTRA MAHAMUDRA.

Thus, mahamudra can be a sutra, tantra, or essence practice, depending on which practices are used to refine the coarse and subtle levels of the mind before essence instructions are given to address the very subtle mind.”

^^ AHH, I think this does clarify my Q.  Mahamudra, then, I think singularly refers to realization at level of very subtle mind.  in other words, a direct cognition of emptiness at level of first arya brumi, then, is not a mahamudra realization, even though it is realizing the nature of mind on one level.

If you are with a Tibetan Lama doing a group practice, you should practice in "Tibetan", even if it sounds awful (it does).

If you are by yourself, you should practice in English, because just as mantras pronounced improperly will only delay your practice; just as mumbling your sadhanas will delay your practice; chanting liturgies in phoneticized "Tibetan" only results in making sounds which at best only vaguely resemble Tibetan, sounds which you do not understand, nor will be understood by anyone who is a Tibetan speaker, and thus you will merely cause obstacles for yourself.

This does not mean one should not take pains to learn Tibetan, which is the only proper way to learn how to pronounce it. This does not mean that certain prayers like the seven line prayer, the Migtsema, the short Barceh Lamsel and so on should not be recited in Tibetan — of course they should -- it is easy to learn how to properly pronounce a few lines of Tibetan. This does not mean one can practice a chod liturgy in English (attempts have been made but they all suck). But as a general rule English speakers who do not know Tibetan should practice in English apart from the above noted exceptions, that at least is my opinion.

Would like to pose a question--this is primarily for Westerners who do solo practice of the higher tantras on a regular basis, but I'm interested in anyone's views: your genuine gut feelings, as well as whatever advice you may have received from teachers.

Is it a really serious disadvantage to one's personal progress and realization if one practices in the vernacular? I know lamas frequently mention the blessings of using Tibetan. But, IMHO Westerners have something that may compensate in some measure: a strong. almost visceral connection to the sound of Sanskrit. (At least it seems to be true in my case.) And Sanskrit is, after all, the original for most of the tantras we practice. If one is going to learn a 2nd, 3rd or 4th language for dharma practice, why not Sanskrit (if it's a practical alternative based on surviving sources)?

Also, is it really practical, where there are many complex referents and highly detailed imagery, to expect that the Tibetan  will have the same practicality and power as one's native language?

In a recent book the author compared doing tantric sadhanas in a non-Tibetan language to being blind -- is it really that bad? Should I hand in my tantrika card until I'm fluent in Tibetan?

It is one thing to respect the religion of your ancestors, it is quite another to be confused about refuge.

The issue of Gorakṣanātha was raised. It is true he is counted among the 84 siddhas. It is said he was raised in a Buddhist family and later converted to Shaivism. It is a little unclear what his story is. But this anomaly sheds light on Hathayogapradipika's criticism of the Buddhist siddha Nagabodhi, showing that in such yogic circles there was definite tension between Hindus and Buddhists.

In the example of Mahasiddha Virupa, it was unclear to everyone whether he was Buddhist or Hindu. In order to find out, he was dragged in front of the King of Benares. When it was ascertained he was a Buddhist, he was condemned to death, bound in chains and flung into the Ganges. Houdini-like, he escaped. There are other episodes in his biography which illustrate that Buddhist siddhis circulated among non-Buddhists as part of their vratya, their yogic discipline, to challenge their own realization. In another episode of Virupa's life, after having been invited to be the leader of a royal panel of non-Buddhist panditas,  when it was discovered the book to which he prostrated was the Prajñāpāramitā in 8000 lines, the king (a different one) ordered him to bow to a Shiva linga. Virupa replied that is was inappropriate for an elder brother to prostrate to the younger, and warned the king that it was not going to go well. The kind insisted that Virupa prostrate to this linga, and after he prostrated to it, it shattered, eliciting a complaint from Shiva himself. Virupa was so skilled at conversion through magical displays, eventually Avalokiteshvara interceded and asked Virupa to cease terrifying people with his powers.

We can understand from all this that it is not appropriate for those who have sought refuge in the Three Jewels to seek refuge elsewhere. So the answer to the question "Can one be a Buddhist and a Christian", "can on be a Buddhist and a Hindu", "can one be a Buddhist and a religious Jew" is no. Just as one cannot serve two kings, but must bear allegiance to one above any other, likewise, one cannot belong to Buddhadhama and so some religion and expect any kind of result from from the former, as it clearly states in the Vinaya stanza above.

But without the example wisdom as well as the profound dependent originations arranged by the guru at the time of empowerment, this sūtra mahāmudra cannot go beyond the common practice of the six perfections.

There are many terms for the state of buddhahood in various systems. The meaning is the same, but the means differ, and the length of time to the result as well.

The means of realizing mahāmudra is the two stages and or guru yoga. It is the practice of the an example wisdom introduced at the time of empowerment. This leads to buddhahood in one life, or seven or at most sixteen.

It takes three incalculable eons at minimum to progress to buddhahood via the sūtra path.

There is no difference. Some schools, notably the Sakyapas, maintain that such direct introductions however merely reinforce the example wisdom introduced during empowerment.

I think something that is related is the fact that shamatha and vipashana are cultivated one time around relative to sutra teachings, and then another pass of the same type of cultivation occurs when tantra is officially entered.  This correlates with generation and completion stage respectively. The nature of mind is identified twice, so to speak -- one time with the course level of mind, upon which one becomes an arya bodhisattva and enters the first ground; the second time is with the subtle mind of clear light at the end of the isolation of mind wherein one enters path of seeing in tantra and achieves the illusory body.  So, Mahamudra is going to be practiced differently, depending upon what level of "nature of mind" one is intending to access -- i.e., whether with the course or subtle mind.

He suggests that it was the mundane matters related to dealing with brahmanized royal courts that is is what drove Buddhists to adopt the language of a community often hostile to them:
They did not do so because they liked Sanskrit, or because they liked the Brahmins whose language it was. Nor did they do so for some inherent quality that this language supposedly possesses. They did so because they needed to defend their interests at the royal courts in Sanskrit. They had to use Sanskrit at the courts because Brahmins had been able to secure themselves a central place at the courts by way of their indispensable skills, not because rulers had supposedly “converted” to Brahmanism. This, as far as I can see, is the most plausible explanation of this otherwise puzzling change of language.

It is not puzzling in the least. Buddhists in India switched to Sanskrit because it was the language of educated persons.

Lama Migmar and the Sakya Institute for Buddhist Studies are happy to announce this special event in the Boston area on the weekend of April 11-12, 2015.

For the first time in the West, HH Sakya Trizin Rinpoche will bestow the Chakrasamvara Body Mandala empowerment on the afternoon of Sunday April 12. This event is restricted to those who have already received the Chakrasamvara major two-day initiation from HH or another a Sakya-lineage lama. If you attended the Chakrasamvara initiation with HH in Boston in May 2011, you are qualified to attend. Registration for this event is now open at http://sakya.net.

It has to be the Ghantapada five-deity major empowerment, not just any Cakrasamvara major empowerment. Not even Luipa or Krishancarya's tradition will count.

What we usually think of as "spirits" in the west are called bhutas in India... I'm not sure what the Tibetan translation of that term would be.

In my case it was.
Every day goes by i look at myself and say:"Nope.I am none of that".
Maybe i got it all wrong...who knows...

If you cultivate love, compassion and bodhicitta, you have not gotten anything wrong. Without these three things, Vajrayāna is just an ego trip.

It's a personal opinion based on what i have been doing so far.
I feel like an old person who coming to the end of his life is full of regrets.
I just feel like i wasted my time.

You regret what you have been practicing? Dharma is a waste of time?
