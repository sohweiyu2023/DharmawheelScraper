The Buddha's parinivana dates to roughly around 407 BCE if you follow the dates put forward by Cousins, etc, much earlier if you follow more traditional dates. Yet you claim that Lotus itself dates to a period 300——500 years later. So, is it 1) the Buddha's teaching or 2) merely the work of an inspired Mahāyani, or 3) do you accept the tradition that the Mahāyāna sūtras were kept hidden for hundreds of years by bodhisattvas and slowly revealed?

(On the basis of the Buddha's teaching in the Lankavatara Sutra)

Some schools equate the Tathagatagarbha with the Alayavijnana (which they claim is intrinsically pure) and thus the basis, or cause, of all wholesome actions.

Malcolm wrote:
Some schools? Which schools? Can you name some for me?

In fact it is the Lankāvatara which equates tathāgatagarbha with the ālayavijñāna, but not for the reason you present here.

According to this sūtra, tathāgatagarbha was taught in order to convert to Buddhadharma those immature people who were afraid of the teaching of selflessness. It also teaches that the tathāgatagarbha/ālayavijñāna is the cause of both kusala and akulsala, postive and negative actions. The sūtra says that while the tathāgatagarbha/ālayavijñāna is intrinsically pure, since it is afflicted with adventitious afflictions it appears as if it is impure. Finally, the Buddha's last statement about the tathāgatagarbha in the Lanka is that the tathāgatagarbha is the cause of both samsara and nirvana, as well as both happiness and suffering.

It really does not correspond with the picture you paint of the tathāgatagarbha being this engine of bodhi driving everyone to awakening regardless of their religious affiliation.

Grigoris said:
In Vajrayāna it is clearly explained that such bodhisattvas are not fortunate.
Well, from my personal standpoint, caught in the joyful blender known as Samsara (and with no real exit in sight), I consider 8th level Bodhisattvas fortunate.

Well, all I can say then is you seem not to understand the difference between following the Vajrayāna path and the common sūtra path.

And let's clear up an assumption of yours:  Do you really believe that all Buddhists are motivated by Bodhicitta?  I'm not convinced (again, based on my limited experience).

Malcolm wrote:
Not all Buddhists are followers of Buddhadharma. Many millions of "Buddhists" are culturally "Buddhist" with no understanding of Buddhadharma. Only some so-called "Buddhists" are followers of Buddhadharma.

Those who have taken the bodhisattva vow are motivated by Mahāyāna bodhicitta. Otherwise they would not have not taken the vow. And lest, for example you complain that some people may take it without meaning it, the Surangama Samadhi Sūtra teaches that Māra tried to the deceive the Buddha by taking the bodhisattva vow; but guess what— even if one takes the bodhisattva vow with the intent to deceive, it still has such force that even Papayin Māra received a prediction for full buddhahood.

There are many people who practice Hinayāna who have no interest in Mahāyāna. But they too are generally motivated by love and compassion.

So I can appreciate those bits and pieces without any intention of investing myself whole heartedly in it.

My Refuge in the 3 Jewels is not at risk by doing so.

There are two kinds of gotra, the natural capacity that any sentient being has to awaken, and activated gotra, which comes from taking the bodhisattva vow. Without the latter, full buddhahood is not possible. It is not even possible to be a bodhisattva, much less a bodhisattva on the stages. This is all clearly explained by Maitreyanatha.

I am not playing Devil's advocate, I actually disagree with you.  I do not think that Buddhism has a monopoly on liberation.  I believe that Tirthika can gain insight and achieve liberation because of the innate capacity which exists in all sentient beings: the Tathagatagarbha.

This is a mistaken belief. There is no possibility tīrthikas (who are specifically what we term Hindus, actually), much less other nonBuddhists faiths gather the so called merit and wisdom accumulations.

If they practice the four immeasurables, love, compassion, etc., as well as avoid non-virtue, they will remain in higher realms, depending on their past karma.

However, the merit accumulation depends on having developed bodhicitta (the motivation to become a buddha for the benefit of all sentient beings). When one dedicates one's merit free from the three wheels, it becomes inexhaustible. This is the only way to gather the merit accumulation. Otherwise, one always spends whatever merit one has, eventually, and winds up in lower realms. There is no need to even discuss the wisdom accumulation.

One's "enlightened nature," by which I assume you mean the nature of the mind, is something that one discovers through it being pointed out. Dzogchen teachings make it very clear that without a guru one will never have confidence in the nature of the mind if one discovers it oneself. So as someone who aspires to practice Dzogchen, I understand that a Dzogchen guru is the one thing indispensable for practicing Dzogchen. This is clearly stated in Dzogchen tantras. Not only that, but the need to follow a guru is clearly explained in Buddhadharma in general, including sūtra.

I made two points here that are not contradictory.

1. The sutra itself does not support your contention that Shakyamuni's life span is mere upaya to inspire faith. To arrive at that position one must introduce assumptions not found in or supported by the text.

Malcolm wrote:
Everything is interpretable. Your notion that the text must be taken literally is an assumption you are introducing to the text, which is not supported by the text itself and is directly contradicted by the text:
The Buddhas teach the Dharma

According to the capacities of sentient beings;
The inexperienced cannot understand this.

Queequeg said:
2. To the extent that the Five Certainties stand for the eternity of Sambhogakaya, but not Nirmanakaya, it is inapplicable here. Again, because the text itself resists conformity.

Malcolm wrote:
My comment is based on Prthvibandhu's commentary. This is how the sūtra was commonly understood by Indian exegetes. In other words, Śakyamuni, in this sūtra, is attributing to himself the qualities of a sambhogakāya which are commonly understood to the audience of bodhisattvas. Since only eighth through tenth stage bodhisattva are privileged to see the Sambhogakāya in Akaniṣṭha, he is in this passage making a statement about the inseparability of the three kāyas. Further, to understand this passage in question, one must also understand it in reference to the statement about the purity of the Sahaloka in the Vimalakirti-nirdesa sūtra.

There are many ways to unpack a sūtra's meaning — the literal meaning of the words is generally the least useful and interesting.

The text does not "resist" conformity, as you put it. The idea of the three wheels, for example, or that sūtras are to be understood in light of when in Buddha's career he supposedly taught them is actually the basis for your entire exegesis of this sūtra — but that idea is also not supported in the sūtra. Where did the Buddha say, "You can disregard everything I have said in the past?"

I do think your prose is difficult to understand, but the "Word games" comment was directed at the substance of your comment. In your comment you  appear to describe what amounts a a verbal shell game where meanings are variously ascribed to the particular names of buddhas, or aspects of buddhas, ostensibly to conform to one particular view or another.

As the rest of my comment tries to point out, Shakyamuni as eternal is not an intellectual somersault but the import of the Lotus Sutra text itself. I pointed out that Malcolm suggesting that this message in the Lotus is another upaya in the manner he suggests it is, is not compelling as it is not supported by the text of the sutra, and instead is a complete contradiction.

The Five Certainties, as I can gather, seem to have been a much later development in Indian Buddhist thought. It is, in the very least, awkward to use it to analyze a text that long predates it.

Malcolm wrote:
You are contradicting yourself here. You assume that you can apply someone's traditional exegesis to a text, and discard someone else's traditional exegesis based on some text critical criterion which you merely accept arbitrarily so it won't contradict your prejudices.

Rigzin Jatson Nyingpo (1585-1656) writes:
From that outer, inner secret and ultimate practice with the final action practice, in brief, no matter what kind of creation or completion practice one is doing, the preliminary of the best is one hundred thousand refuges, intents to awaken and prostrations; one hundred thousand Vajrasattvas. One hundred thousand mandalas, and one hundred thousand supplications. If this done before, in the main practice, the obstacles to practice will naturally non-exist, and the signs will quickly appear, and the result will be able to appear according to what is stated in the sadhanas. That is the instruction of the Guru Rinpoche. I, Jatson, have definitely experienced this
Therefore, you will have to revise this statement:

Right view is the abandonment of the view of that the aggregates are a self (satkāyadṛṣti).
Dharmakīrti states very clearly:
Well cultivated right view
destroys craving and its companions.

Anyway, what I meant is that having (especially an intellectual grasp of) Right View doesn't not mean that one is liberated.  Especially ifRight View becomes an object of grasping and identification (with a self).

Malcolm wrote:
The very fact that you put tathāgatagarbha in scare quotes shows that you recognize that it is merely a formal cause, not an efficient cause.

Mundane right view is necessary for realizing supramundane right view. This is the difference, for example, between the paths of accumulation and application (mundane right view) and the path of seeing (supramundane right view).

Right view cannot become an object of grasping to a self. It is automatically the recognition of the absence of the self of the person, at minimum.

Someone who has right view is automatically liberated, in comparison to someone who has wrong view. A person with wrong view will never achieve liberation for as long as they hold wrong views.

The other thing that discussions like this make crystal clear, is the fact that having a conceptual grasp of right view does not necessarily lead to any sort of liberation.  Mainly due to the grasping to (right) view.

Actually, I dare somebody to show me how this logic:

Without Buddhist Right View you cannot be liberated.

Differs from the Evangelical Baptist idea:

Without Baptism one is condemned to Hell.

Because to me there seems to be no discernible difference between these two attitudes, nor in the "reasoning" behind them.

With regards to your position that there is no clear evidence of the "evolution of Ngondro" I would only offer this simple point. Buddha Shakyamuni did not teach on the 4 extra-ordinary practices of Ngondro. In-fact there is no Sutric source for the 4 extra-ordinary practices themselves.

Malcolm wrote:
Why would there be a sūtra source for practices such as Vajrasattva, Maṇḍala and Guru Yoga? The first comes from Yoga Tantra, and the second two sre found in the Guhyasamaja Tantra.

The klong gsal 'bar ma nyi ma nyi ma rgyud, revealed by Nyang Ral Nyima Odzer in the late 12th century, explicitly lists the four common foundations, impermanence, death, karma, and suffering of samsara, as well as refuge, bodhicitta, mandala, Vajrasattva, and Guru Yoga. It is almost certain that this pattern of preliminaries dates from this tantra. This tantra itself set the pattern for Nyingma practice up until today.

With respect to Vajrasattva, it explicitly states it should be recited "Recite this one hundred, one thousand, one hundred thousand or countless times."

OK so this is one of the key differences between samkhya and Dzogchen?

From a Dzogchen PoV, samkhya basically:
- takes conditioned mind to be permanent and the origin of all things
- does not recognise primordial consciousness (yeshe) as the basis
- just rests in conditioned mind

Is this right?

So from a Buddhist PoV, is this a cause for rebirth in the arupadhatu?


Malcolm wrote:
The purusha is a passive knower, deluded into thinking the transformations of the three gunas of pradhana/prakriti— sattva, tamas, and rajas— are distinct as the 24 tattvas — from mahat/buddhi down to the earth element. When a purusha recognizes all of this is nonself, it withdraws from all of it and abides in its own permanent, unique effulgence. There are infinite purushas.

The criticism of the Saṃkhya system of other yogis, is that not recognizing purusha, they mistake the most subtle form of sattva, i.e., mahat, as the self and rest in that state. But prakriti is not sentient, its sentient appearance is a reflection of the effulgence of purusha. So basically, they assert the nirvana of the Buddhists, for example, is simply resting in unmanifest prakriti, in a state where the three gunas are in stasis.

Of course we know the Buddhist criticisms of Samkhya are: they assert a permanent self, they assert identity of cause and effect, and they assert prakriti and purusha as real.

It is important to understand Saṃkhya well, since it is the foundation for all Hindu thought.

So called Neo-Advaita does not go beyond Saṃkhya in many respects. The reason why many people think that Advaita and Dzogchen, etc., are the same is that they do not understand Saṃkhya. All this business about the pure knower, the witness, etc., has its roots in Saṃkhya tenets.

The main difference between standard Advaita and Saṃkhya is that Advaita asserts that when purusha does not recognize its own state, it is saguna Brahman, and that purusha is itself brahman, and there is only one, and third, that the transformations of the three gunas are not real, but are Māya.Therefore, when one recognizes that all the appearances of the 24 tattvas are notself, one recognizes brahman as oneself and one rests in that state.

MiphamFan said:
OK, so in Samkhya:
-In samsara, purusha, pure consciousness, passively "knows" prakriti, which includes all the various physical and mental phenomena (the tattvas).

Malcolm wrote:
Yes.


MiphamFan said:
-To achieve liberation, one must distinguish purusha from prakriti in one's lifetime.
-In the process of achieving liberation, one makes use of intellect (buddhi) to distinguish the lower tattvas from the purusha

Malcolm wrote:
The process actually is balancing the three gunas so that sattva becomes predominant. When one is thoroughly sattvic, then one notices also that buddhi is not the self either, and the jñā aka purusha, becomes embarrassed and turns away from prakriti altogether.

MiphamFan said:
-Upon death, the purusha permanently separates from prakriti, knows itself and is liberated forever.
-Both purusha and prakriti are real and eternal.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes.



MiphamFan said:
So I guess where people confuse samkhya with Dzogchen is that they:

- get tripped up by the similarity in expression of "distinguishing mind from nature of mind" in Dzogchen and "distinguishing purusha from prakriti"
- confuse rigpa as being a permanent purusha that "knows itself"

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, since rigpa is not a purusha, it is knowledge.

Interestingly enough, however, Saṃkhya also uses the terms vidyā and avidyā in a way very similar to Dzogchen. But the meaning is totally different.


MiphamFan said:
However, they forget the part where samkhya asserts purusha is permanent and separate from prakriti. Whereas in Dzogchen, what samkhya calls "prakriti" is simply the display of five lights, not separate from your own state. So what samkhya calls "prakriti" and "purusha" are both part of your own state. And rang gi rig pa is not something that "knows itself" like (A) knows (A) but simply knowledge that arises from oneself about one's state.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes.
MiphamFan said:
Also, I guess the methods involved in both are quite different.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes.

MiphamFan said:
So in base, path and fruit they are all different. The only similarities are some expressions in translated English texts. If anything, samkhya seems more similar to realist Hinayana schools to me?

Yes.

I know he is a Nyingma lineage holder, but from the teachings I've seen him give, he seems more focused on Mahamudra/Taklung Kagyu with sometimes dipping into the Barchey Kunsel terma. I've met him a few times and he is quite wonderful, but I've never seen him offer any teachings related to Dzogchen before. Hopefully this is just my karma and that will change soon.

I will explain it one more time. I noticed a similarity in structure between Advaita and gzhan stong arguments, not a similarity in content. I asked him about this, and while he allowed there was a structural similarity, there was no similarity in content.

In other words, the basis is different, the path is different, the result is different.

Agreed. Morality generally involves the good-bad dichotomy, which is dualistic thinking. This can also be accompanied by an inflexibility, rather than looking at each situation on its merits.

Rinpoche also makes reference to the three kinds of suffering, which I was taught in the Gelugpa tradition are: suffering of suffering, suffering of change and all pervasive suffering.

Is it correct, Malcolm, to understand that the three kinds of compassion are directed at the three kinds of suffering?

No, because the second kind of compassion is oriented towards the third suffering, which has to do with the impermanent condition nature of all phenomena.

Actually, he said it was related to the first compassion, compassion with reference to sentient beings. It is a strange statement. It is not worth trying to guess what he meant. I am sure he has a reason for his statement, but he did not articulate it particularly well.

In sum, there are three kinds of compassion: compassion with reference to sentient beings, compassion with reference to phenomena, and nonreferential compassion. The first is compassion for the suffering of sentient beings; the second is for the impermanence of all phenomena (which of course is the basis of suffering), and the third is meditating on emptiness.

You are taking this notion of no "substantial difference" the wrong way. What I mean is that in Advaita, nirguna brahman is empty of saguna brahmin, it is empty of anything you might call a relative entity. Likewise, in gzhan stong, it is argued that the perfected nature is empty of the two relatives natures. In this way there is a structural similarity between the two systems. But it does not mean, nor did I ever assert that Advaita and gzhan stong were equivalent in every respect. After all, it was my question and I assume I have a better memory of asking it than you do.

His only response was a sectarian polemic "But there is no buddhahood in Vedanta!" Now, mind you, I am not saying that there is such a thing. But when you study these texts, you come to realize, even as Bhavaviveka and Shantaraksita both observed, that language of Advaita and the language of Madhyamaka are more or less identical. Shantaraksita complains in his Tattvasiddhi to the effect "If you accept the nature of things is non-arising, why do you not become Buddhist!?"

Now, again, I am not saying that if you practice Advaita you will become a buddha -- I honestly do not know. But I am saying that when you study these things, philosophically, at any rate, it is very hard to show the difference between Advaita and Madhyamaka. The main difference between them is that Hindus accept the Vedas as self-originated and Buddhists do not.
All conditioned phenomena are impermanent.
All afflicted phenomena are suffering
All phenomena lack identity
Nirvana is bliss.

You can find these four seals in Advaita Vedanta as well. Just substitute brahman for nirvana and you have a perfect match. It is very hard to differentiate brahman from nirvana. Really, go ahead and try.

Ok, then in English I'll say that the 3 natures are imaginary, dependent, and ultimate, with the ultimate as being empty of anything other than its own innate pure qualities and Buddha Nature.

Pretty standard Shentong view and terminology.

Malcolm wrote:
No, the three natures are the imputed (parikalpita kun brtags), the dependent ( paratantra, gzhan dbang ),  and the perfected nature ( paraniṣpanna, yongs grub ) .

The way the Tibetans who follow gzhan stong understand things such as Kongtrul, Khyentse Wangpo, and so on understand things — the perfected nature refers to the luminosity of the mind, which is considered to have infinite, ultimate qualities. It does not however refer something apart from the mind.

Khyentse Wangpo states:
From among the three natures, both the imputed and dependent nature are temporary phenomena, i.e., the intrinsically empty relative. The two aspects of perfected nature are the pristine consciousness of the dharmadhātu, the extrinsically empty ultimate meaning. 

Among the outer, inner, and alternate; the external container universe and the inhabiting sentient beings are the mutable, temporary dharmin, i.e., the intrinsically empty relative. The alternate is the sugatagarbha, the unchanging fundamental dharmatā, i.e., extrinsically empty ultimate meaning. 

In general, among the basis, path, and result, the basis is the sugatagarbha, the pristine consciousness of the all-basis, the basis of the transformation of all samsara and nirvana— 1) the basis of purification of the aspect of faults and 2) the basis of manifesting the aspect of qualities. 

The path is the method of exhausting the aspect of faults in that basis, and the method of manifesting the aspect of qualities, accompanied by the two accumulations. The accumulation of pristine consciousness removes the covering obscuration of the qualities of the dharmakāya that have always existed as naturally perfected from the beginning. The accumulation of merit gradually develops the qualities of the rūpakāya which did not previously exist.

The result is 1) the result of separation, the dharmakaȳa, the ultimate meaning, the suchness kāya, and 2) the generated result, the rūpakāya, the symbolic, relative kāya, which exist as the abundance of one's own benefit and other's benefit.
This is all a discussion of one's own dharmatā, not a soul, nor an overarching universal pleroma.

smcj said:
The point is that there is no point to eternalism if there is no eternal agent or object.
Defining terms:

I'm using "eternalism" to refer to an Ultimate Reality that is unborn or non-manifest.

My understanding of "soul" is an identity or something manifest that is unchanging.

For instance, Kalu R gave the example of a being that is born successively as an elephant, then fish, then bird. Can you say that the true identity of the fish is really that of the elephant? Or say that the bird's identity is really as a fish? No. There is nothing essential and unchanging about any of those successive identities. Nothing about the continuity that goes between lifetimes limits the metamorphosis between lives. Thus there is no essential unchanging identity, no "soul", involved in the continuity. Part of its nature is limitless freedom to be expressed as anything whatsoever.

Malcolm wrote:
The term "ultimate reality" does not exist in Buddhist texts. This is a very misleading English gloss. The terms we have for an "ultimate" are 1) ultimate truth, i.e, paramārtha or don dam, which means "ultimate meaning" or "ultimate sense"; suchness, i.e. tatāta or de bzhin nyid; dharmatā or chos nyid refer to the ultimate essence of relative phenomena. Indeed, these terms, and others like them, are all pointing out something definitive about relative phenomena or beings.

There are terms in Buddhism that mean "reality," like gnas lugs, bhutatā, but there is no need to add the adjective "ultimate" to such terms because what is real is real. There is no relative reality as opposed to an ultimate reality. The first would be contradiction in terms, since the relative is not real, not constant, not unchanging, etc. The second is redundant since the real is constant, unchanging, etc.

There is no separate unmanifest reality which stands apart from manifest phenomena. This "nonarising" you seek is precisely the nonarising nature of dependently originated phenomena, their emptiness of arising, ceasing, and abiding.

Emptiness is the quality of things that allows them to undergo change and transformation.

Nonarising, aka, emptiness is ultimate truth and reality. Emptiness and nonarising are ultimate truths, veridical cognitions arrived at through an analysis of dependently originated phenomena. Emptiness and non-arising are real because they withstand analysis, i.e., they are the result that one finds upon analysis, they are the content of āryan cognition in equipoise.

But emptiness and nonarising are not ultimate realities because if they were, there would be nothing other than a blank void.

Hi Malcolm,

I am quiet surprised by your answer.

In the Bhagavad Gita - quiet a major scripture - for exemple, the liberation presented, and which is quiet strongly adopted by many schools, is a freedom from the circle of birth and death.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, of course, all Indian schools who propose liberation propose that liberation means freedom from the cycles of birth and death.

Buddha disagreed with all of these schools completely, and taught it was only through adopting right view, i.e., the four truths of nobles, that one could attain freedom from the cycle of birth and death.

He taught that they mistook various types of mental states for liberation, mental states which in some cases last millions and millions of years.

The Bhgavada Gita for example, is an example of an eternalist scripture, and it proposes the best way to achieve liberation is through pure devotion to Krishna as embodiment of Godhead, though it lists other paths as well.

Saṃkhya is described as an incorrect view because it proposes that causes and effects are merely transformations of one substance. Yoga also suffers from this view.

Jainism is clearly refuted by the Buddha. This is a no brainer. The Buddha thought that Mahathera was a complete fool.

Nyaya and Vaishesika did not exist during the time of the Buddha, but their eternalist atomism was soundly negated by later Buddhist scholars such as Bhavaviveka and so on.

The Mimamsas do not believe in liberation at all, but rather believe in appeasing the gods through rites in order to assure mundane good fortune.

Advaita also did not exist by name during the time of the Buddha, but it is refuted for proposing that all reality is ultimately one undifferentiated consciousness.

When one reads the sūtras and tantras taught by the Buddha, one can see very clearly that all these schools are refuted either directly or indirectly as wrong views.

Wrong view cannot be lead to liberation.

There is only one right view, and that is the view of dependent origination.

If you want to really practice Dzogchen, true devotion to a qualified guru is a necessary precondition. Following their instructions carefully is the next step. If you do this, you will undoubtedly receive such teachings.

If you like Bonpo teachings, you can study with a number of Bonpo Lamas as well. They also teach a complete path of Dzogchen, and guru devotion is no less important in their school.

Yes, one can argue that, but one can also argue that this is not about Buddha-nature at  but a characteristic of the mind. After all, can Buddhanature, or enlightened mind be defiled?

Malcolm wrote:
Buddhanature (buddhadhātu) can be covered with obscurations. This is the purpose for the discussion in the Uttaratantra of the nine examples of how the buddhadhātu is covered with obscurations, which come from the ten tathātagarbha sūtras.

Buddhanature is nothing other than dharmakāya covered with afflictions (Luminous, monks, is the mind.[1] And it is defiled by incoming defilements); dharmakāya is nothing other than one's mind when it is freed from all obscurations (Luminous, monks, is the mind. And it is freed from incoming defilements.).

Wayfarer said:
I'm sure that, from the Mahayana perspective, that verse can be taken to refer to Buddha Nature, but does the actual term 'tathāgatagarbha' appear in the Pali? And do you think a Theravadin would agree that that is what is meant by it?

Malcolm wrote:
The meaning is what is important. I used the Pali canon for convenience. But this sutta also exists in the Agamas. Statements like it exist in Mahāyāna sūtras as well.

Thus, your question, will a Hinayāna practitioner recognize that this as a reference to tathāgatagarbha, no. But that is not important since we in Mahāyāna understand the meaning of Agamas, etc., from the point of view of Mahāyāna, not from the point of view of Hinayāna.

I cited the Pali text to show a continuity in Buddha's teaching about the luminosity of the mind, which is an important connecting thread between Buddha's Hinayāna teachings and his Mahāyāna teachings.

Awareness is a ground condition that ‘supports’ consciousness.  The nature of awareness is effulgence and it is in a not-knowing state before the appearance of object.  Consciousness, on the other hand, is appearance of objects in the mind.  When awareness touches on objects, consciousness would arise simultaneously.  Consciousness is naturally looking outward to objects and it is flitting all the time.

It can be either way.  Firstly there is the arising of preliminary awareness, then there is the arising of consciousness cum intermediary awareness, thereafter the arising of consciousness cum advanced awareness, and lastly the arising of ultimate/full awareness - samprajana.

Just like the emptiness of phenomena is both the cause and consequence of the dependent nature of phenomena.

Moksha is a word that means liberation. Most Indian schools— of six orthodox darshanas Mimamsa being the only exception— propose a theory of liberation.

Buddhadharma however rejects all of these as leading to true liberation, asserting the result of these schools is rebirth in a deva realm (at best), rather than the ending of birth in samsara.

You actually want me to run through the list of anti-theist and anti-nihilist arguments you know perfectly well. What is the point?

The point I am making is that we can see over and over again the Buddhas stating unequivocally that outside his Dharmavinaya there is no liberation. It is not like the Buddha made coherent arguments for his case. He merely stated it was so. One either accepts his statements or not.

The principle reason of course is that the Buddha's view is dependent origination, and it is by seeing the cause of suffering and so on with respect to the three realms he attained buddhahood.

The thing is, we have, most of us, been talking about these same issues for years. I assume, perhaps wrongly, we are for the most part familiar with the Dharma to a sufficient extent that it is not necessary to fully litigate every statement which asserts liberation from samsara is the exclusive domain of Buddhadharma.

Do you mean that everyone, in all six realms, who is not liberated now has previously met Dharma, fallen from it, and needs to re-enter by means of aspirations and accumulations? Or are some beings excluded from liberation?

See above. If faith in Jesus, Allah, Krishna, and so on help one to be a virtuous and kind person, one might indeed experience the result of a human birth with the eight freedoms and ten endowments.

But the practice of the ten virtues and compassion will not by themselves lead to liberation. Liberation requires insight into the nature of reality, emptiness.

"Buddhanature" is a name for the nature of the mind. It means since the nature of the mind, clarity and emptiness, can be found in all minds, that nature of the mind can be realized by all beings, given the proper causes and conditions.

As to the permanence of Buddhas — when someone frees their mind from the afflictions that cause rebirth in samsara, and attains omniscience, that person is a buddha. Buddhas are permanent in so far as there are no conditions which can inhibit their continuums. Thus, buddhas remain in the world for as long as there are sentient beings who require their assistance, manifesting when needed. When there are no more sentient beings, there is no further need for buddhas in the world.

I was reporting someone else's opinion, not my own.

With respect to symbols, if we called Dzogchen "George" and by "George" we understand we are referring to the original basis — essence, nature, and compassion — than there is no problem. The point is understanding essence, nature, and compassion.

Buddhas are beyond concepts and limitations, but strangely enough, only Buddhas teach Dzogchen.

There are many Buddhist schools that do not teach Dzogchen (most in fact) or Vajrayāna in general, but Dzogchen (and Vajrayāna) is only taught by Buddhas and those in their lineage. Dzogchen and Vajrayāna in general are Buddhadharma, and do not exist in other traditions, either on this planet or any other.

The fact that ChNN has said that anyone can come to him and receive Dzogchen teachings has inadvertently lead to a kind of false ecumenicalism on the part of some people who really seem to have neglected important parts of their training in Dharma.

My hopes from this thread were solely to see if ChNN had stated his views on Jesus. These hopes were fulfilled in the very first response.

Malcolm wrote:
What you seem not to have understood is that Buddhists claim, generally, that anything good in nonBudddhist paths is in reality the work of some emanation who emanates in a nonBuddhist form because those beings are too dull and or barbaric to appreciate the Dharma, for which they are not ready.

For example, Ṡiva, in the Buddhist sūtras (Karandavyuha), is stated to be someone who was tamed by Avalokiteśvara and brought into the Dharma, and attained realization. But Ṡiva remains a worldly refuge and not one in whom we take refuge. To do so would be to completely misunderstand the meaning of refuge. ChNN can certainly believe that Jesus was an awakened person (an emanation of a bodhisattva since there was no Dharma for him to study — this is the only way.  While the dispensation of a Buddha is in the world, there can be no pratyekabuddhas, thus ruling out Ramana Maharshi as an awakened person as well), but his opinion about Jesus as a refuge is clear — not a proper object for guru yoga. Then we have fools like  Michael Roach who compose Jesus Sadhanas.

But I see people get all hopeful all the time, and think that when someone like HHDL, TNH, etc., proclaim their notion that Jesus might have been an "enlightened person," this someone means Jesus is on the same level as the Buddha, or even Avalokiteṡvara.

This kind of thinking has its roots in the bane of all reason, the source of the New Age movement, and a great deal of racist ideas about history, the Theosophical Society.

I can't speak for smcj, but for me this isn't about "going to Jesus for refuge." It's about respect for a remarkable spiritual figure and also about skilful means - use whatever helps you unseat bad habits and delusion.

Early on in Dharma practice it can be useful to forcefully reject every other path, to focus 100% on the one you picked. Then, once faith has taken root, I think it can be useful sometimes to delve into other teachings. Not to say 'necessary'. Whatever works.

We all suffer from blinkered narrow views and hubris. But we also know that the heart/mind does not open to the essence with such an approach. At some point, the right point, all this needs to be shed. Hopefully, our precious teachers will encourage us to do that, and that we heed their advice.

When a person has right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration, right knowledge, & right release, whatever bodily deeds he undertakes in line with that view, whatever verbal deeds... whatever mental deeds he undertakes in line with that view, whatever intentions, whatever vows, whatever determinations, whatever fabrications, all lead to what is agreeable, pleasing, charming, profitable, & easeful. Why is that? Because the view is auspicious.

"Just as when a sugar cane seed, a rice grain, or a grape seed is placed in moist soil, whatever nutriment it takes from the soil & the water, all conduces to its sweetness, tastiness, & unalloyed delectability.

In ChNN's game of liberation, landing in the Christian Heaven sends you right back to the deva realm, asura realm, or into the human realm, where, if you are lucky, you have to pick up a Buddhist path based on achieving the precious human birth with the eight freedoms and ten endowments if you want achieve liberation.

I can't speak for smcj, but for me this isn't about "going to Jesus for refuge." It's about respect for a remarkable spiritual figure and also about skilful means - use whatever helps you unseat bad habits and delusion.

Early on in Dharma practice it can be useful to forcefully reject every other path, to focus 100% on the one you picked. Then, once faith has taken root, I think it can be useful sometimes to delve into other teachings. Not to say 'necessary'. Whatever works.

We all suffer from blinkered narrow views and hubris. But we also know that the heart/mind does not open to the essence with such an approach. At some point, the right point, all this needs to be shed. Hopefully, our precious teachers will encourage us to do that, and that we heed their advice.

Merton never practiced Dzogchen and he never received Dzogchen teachings. He did not know Tibetan and Chatral Rinpoche refused to teach through a translator.

Harold Talbot, who was with Merton during this time in India, recounts his memoirs here:

Dan74 said:
Talbott: The fact is that he told the Dalai Lama that wanted to study Dzogchen so the Dalai Lama spent hours preparing him to find a Dzogchen guru. And he found him in the Chatral Rinpoche. He went down to Sri Lanka where he convinced himself that he had the experience of dhamakaya (emptiness), seeing the status of the Shakyamuni statues and Ananda.

Then he was electrocuted and died and we are left to sit here and talk about how Dzogchen was the final bestowal on Merton by a divinely compassionate savior.

And Jesus taught many wonderful teachings. So without even stretching as far as to say that what he taught could have led to awakening, what he taught could have led to a lessening of the vexations and cultivation of Paramitas. And this is already wonderful. If you fail to see such an obvious point, I don't think I could make it any more accessible.

Malcolm wrote:
Confucius also taught many wonderful things that might have led to a lessening of vexation and a cultivation of the perfections — but I don't see many people piling on to claim that Confucius was an "enlightened being." We can say the same thing about Marcus Aurelius and so on.

It's all very clear to those it is clear to, Malcolm. Circular reasoning is the best justification of our current beliefs.

What is precisely this Dharma and Discipline? There's more than one definition, more than one understanding of it. Just as there's more than one take on what Jesus had taught.

Malcolm wrote:
The Dharma and Vinaya of the Buddha, of course, where the 8-fold path exists. That begins with right view, and continues with the rest.

You claim there is more than one understanding of right view? No. "Right view," according to the Buddha, means understanding the four noble truths: suffering, its cause, its cessation, and knowledge of the path leading to the end of suffering. People who do not understand this and accept it as fundamental are not followers of Buddhadharma.

And as for the simplicity of Jesus's message, one do well to remind oneself of the simplicity of Garchen Rinpoche's message.  An essential message is not necessarily a simple message.

How many here can live up to the teaching:

"The second is this: 'Love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no commandment greater than these." Mark 12:31

It drives the problem underground where it becomes even harder to tackle it. Racism and its much more mildmannered cousin tribalism, are deep human characteristics and have to be dealt with not with violence (whether in act or speech) but in an atmosphere of openness and acceptance, where people can speak out loud about their concerns, share stories, hear each other out and build bridges.

Anonymous X said:
BUDDHAHOOD IS NOT ATTAINED BY PURPOSEFUL ACTION

If secret rigpa, the actual buddha-dynamic, eludes us,
to attain release by any purposeful action is no option.
“Everything is impermanent and bound to perish”—
how can a tight mesh of body, speech, and mind
reach out to touch its indestructible core?
In the event of failure to intuit intrinsic rigpa, which is pure being there is
no chance that we can attain release in this lifetime by any deliberate physical,
verbal, or mental act. Religious practice becomes a tense constraining
mesh constricting and veiling rigpa, and although some small satisfaction
may follow, the product is conditioned and thus certain to fade away, perishing
like an earthen pot. Such practice can never attain to the indestructible
reality of pure being. Whatever is deliberately created is conditioned and transient, whereas its opposite, the uncreated, is imperishable. Since it
is indestructible, pure being can only be seen by nondeliberate, unintended
relaxation into the natural state; goal-oriented action is a mesh of constraint
leading us closer to buddhahood by not so much as a hair’s breadth.
Such ambition may well be regarded as a futile samsaric trap.

Longchenpa's words seem pretty clear to me.

Having established that samaya can be regarded by the student as not bonding if the Guru goes against the Dharma, my initial question was what creates the 'qualified Vajra Master' in the first place?

Malcolm wrote:
Minimum qualifications are that one has received the empowerment for the mandala or deity which one intends to transmit, and has either done the retreat in a perfect way or has the permission from one's guru to give the empowerment. This is the absolute bare minimum to be a "vajramaster."

OK, I think the following question should be answered definitively, if possible:

Assume a fully qualified guru gives an empowerment in such a way that samaya with a given student is definitely established. Is it possible that such a guru eventually goes off the rails? If that happens, is the student still bound by samaya?

Perhaps the key terms involved, such as "qualified guru", "samaya" and "going off the rails", need to be clarified, but I think this is an important question.

Malcolm wrote:
If the guru in question merely goes insane, harmlessly, yes, the student is still bound by samay. If the guru begins to break his own samaya by harming others, going against the Dharma, repudiating the Dharma, etc., then the student is free of samaya. For example if some guru starts claiming they have a teaching more profound than the Buddhadharma, this would be a clear sign that it is ok to exit.

dzogchungpa said:
OK, can you provide sources for this? "Harming others" is kind of vague. Just to give a well-known, possibly stupid, example, there is the story of Do Khyentse hunting and so on.

Malcolm wrote:
Do Khyentse, according to legend, was capable to reviving animals he hunted from their butchered remains, so he does not count. In any case killing animals is not grounds for the expulsion of a monk from monastic Sangha, neither is drinking for that matter. But killing a human being constitutes such grounds. I don't think there are any stories of Do Khyentse killing anyone.




dzogchungpa said:
It seems to me one could easily conclude that a guru is harming others, but actually be mistaken in that assessment. In that case would one break one's samaya by denouncing them, say? Note, I am not saying this with the Sogyal people in mind.

It is absolutely clear what "Not in accordance with the Dharma" means — taking the life of human beings (including abortions), stealing, sexual misconduct, lying and other verbal non-virtues out of malice, greed, or ignorance. In other words, if a guru has a pattern of behavior which is based on the ten nonvirtues, it is pretty clear that such a guru should be abandoned, and if their behavior warrants it, they should be exposed.

For instance, there is not a single translation of the Ye-shes bla-ma available in published form that is worth the price it costs. They are all flawed. And Sangye Khandro "putting Germano in his place" should first start to learn a little bit of classical tibetan before she starts criticzing others. Her Tshig-don mdzod is replete with mistakes, imprecise renderings, misidentifications of the grammatical subject in sentences, incapacities of contextualizing quotations (and therefore, again, misidentifying the grammatical subject) and so forth. On the other hand, with the exception of the lexicon (and I guess everyone has his/her own lexicon), I haven't found any such mistakes in Germano's works so far.

Whatever one may think of Lama Chonam and Sangye's translations, she would never be so arrogant as to present togal topics in a public setting in which many people had no transmission of Dzogchen. People will be able to listen to the recording of the conference and judge for themselves.

It is a question of respect for the Dharma here that is at issue, not translations. The errors to which I refer are not translations errors per se, but errors in basic knowledge of Dharma which one cannot learn properly in present day academic settings, a point with which I am sure you will agree.

Naturally, those people who have first received a traditional shedra education or some approximation of the same before going into western degree programs are not as likely to make those basic errors.

Although in the correct ordering of things the False Aspectarians are, as a result, placed higher on the scale of views, nevertheless, because the system exhibits many inconsistencies on the level of the conventional truth, the conventional should be expounded according to the system of the True Aspectarians.

Even if one accepts the dependence on certain so-called Yogini tantras were influenced by or even derived from Shaiva tantras (an assertion which is still being refined  -- and bitterly contested -- by those scholars who have the most in-depth knowledge of these two subjects), the author is (to begin with) completely ignoring the whole esoteric tradition within Buddhism that had already been developing in Central and East Asia during the period in question ("medieval" is a loaded word better not used unless defined), relying on, traditionally the Mahavairocana and Vajrasekhara scriptures, but also including a lot of practices and lines that have since died out.  These Vajrayana practices were not transgressive (mostly), and were in no way dependent on either the Yogini tantras or Shaiva stuff.

"Now, you all [meaning the students] should look without artifice at [your] vidyā in the sky in front [of you]; vividly without distraction; clearly without support; resting in the state of radiance.
It is from this thread: https://dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f ... 80#p353991

Unless it is a figure of speech, it implies that rigpa (at least in the case of someone who is still a beginner) may be found specifically where one applies mindfulness at a given moment. If you are focusing on the eye consciousness for example, you may be able to integrate that and be in rigpa in your eye consciousness. With this idea in mind, one may consider the various methods for recognizing rigpa to work on the same assumption. Then again, the above quote perhaps would be more correctly read as an instruction not to focus on vision but on nothing in particular. But the question still stands.

As I understand, it is not possible to be mindful of everything simultaneously. For example, you may be mindful of your vision, but doesn't that mean that at that moment you are not really mindful of your hearing?

Is there a connection between rigpa and mindfulness in this regard, where rigpa is found in the specific experience only, or is rigpa all-encompassing? I have never seen this discussed before.

I am inclined to think that rigpa is not tied to mindfulness in this way, but that would probably mean that it is possible to fall in a ditch because you did not notice it while being in rigpa.

Yes, I am pretty certain that is what he meant.

pemachophel said:
Or, if one knows their particular lineage of a particular terma cycle has not been damaged by broken samaya, is one "good to go?" For instance, one's particular lineage of Lonchen Nyingthig since you (or your Teacher) used that as an example.

I ask this because one frequently hears Tibetans say that their particular lineage of this or that terma is "special," "pure," "unbroken," etc.

Malcolm wrote:
He was pretty clear that the shorter the lineage the better.

Of course, this does not mean that these older teachings are worthless, of course not. But if you can receive teachings from an authentic terton, directly or from someone like Thrinley Norbu, Dzongsar, Chatral Rinpoche, Garab Doje, Khenpo Lodo Tsultrim, Khenpo Namdrol, etc., who received them directly, it is better.

The two main Dudjom Tersar Drolo practices discovered by Dudjom Rinpoche have the same lineage, the same mandala (pretty much), and the same mantra, but require different empowerments. Always wondered why but if it's like that with one Dudjom Tersar yidam, I imagine it would be the same for others. The two tersar Vajrakilaya practices also require separate empowerments, but they are more different than the two Drolo practices.

I was thinking about this in relation to practising a yidam like Vajrakilaya. So, supposing one's yidam is Vajrakilaya, would it be better to practice a recent terma Phurba practice like that of Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok rather than Dudjom Tersar, Putri Regphung, and better to practice Putri Regphung rather than Namchak Pudri, and better to practice Namchak Pudri rather than Longchen Nyingthig's Vajrakilaya, and better to practice Longchen Nyingthig's Vajrakilaya rather than Jigme Lingpa's Phurba Gyu lug or Khon lug Phurba?

Surely, age isn't the only deciding factor? Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok's Phurba Gurkukma is quite short and unelaborate compared to, say, Namchak Pudri. Maybe that would be better as a main practice as it includes lots of other stuff?

Any thoughts would be gratefully received.

Malcolm wrote:
Any teaching you can receive directly from an authentic terton will have the most blessings, especially if they are still living. Any recent terma which has as short alineage as possible will have more blessings than a longer one. For example, these days people practice Putri Repung as the sadhana, on the basis of Namchag Putri, which has many instructions.

With respect to older termas, and traditions, the problem is mainly that accumulation of broken samaya in the lineage overtime.

In a discussion largely triggered by Sogyal's misogynistic treatment of women there is nothing off topic about raising the topics of patriarchy/sexism/feminism, as your own frequent mentions of patriarchy in this thread attest.  And i barely touched on 'feminism' in any case. So the need to shoo me off seems pretty sexist. Irony much?

Norwegian said:
No, you completely misunderstand.

The creation of a specific dedicated thread to that particular topic can allow one to explore more thoroughly (and in depth) that subject matter, where the space for that issue is 100% dedicated to it, instead of the primary subject matter discussed here, and some of the related ones.

The question then is, if you're really interested in an extended discussion on that topic, why are you not making such a thread? You've had plenty of time to do so, but so far nothing.

Just make a thread with a good title and opening post where you present the issue you want to discuss, and your thoughts on it, and I'm sure it'll gain traction.

What is the english word for samaya?

Malcolm wrote:
"Samaya" basically means "coming to a mutual understanding , agreement , compact , covenant , treaty , contract , arrangement , engagement , stipulation , conditions of agreement, terms."

It is rooted in a notion of contractual obligation which results when two people agree on something. In this case, before a guru offers an empowerment, the disciple has to agree to some terms in order to enter the mandala for which the teacher is giving an empowerment. The teacher also has obligations which he or she must fulfill in order to be able to offer than empowerment.

This is the base level definition of samaya. There are much deeper understandings, like the four unbreakable samayas of the Great Perfection.

I’m also very wary of the way too many teachers (even those belonging to Krishnamurti’s organization) extract just one aspect of Buddha’s teachings, bury the Buddhist jargon, then claim that everything they say is their own revelation. It’s complete bullshit! Every word they say can be traced back to the sutras and tantras. So never forget that these ‘new age’ teachers merely focus on a single point that already exists in Buddhadharma, then present it as their own.

If you read Aryadeva's 400 verses you will discover there the Madyamaka refutation of family lineages.
Are you making a distinction between lineage and family lineage, Malcolm?

HHDL has said:
Within the context of Tibetan Buddhism, the importance of lineage extends far beyond the ordinary sense of a particular line of inheritance or descent. Lineage is a sacred trust through which the integrity of Buddha's teachings is preserved intact as it is transmitted from one generation to the next. The vital link through which the spiritual tradition is nourished and maintained is the profound connection between an enlightened master and perfectly devoted disciple.
Are you disagreeing with this?

Malcolm wrote:
I think Āryadeva's rebuttal of lineage can apply to Buddhist lineages as well, especially Vajrayāna lineages. The longer the lineage, the more chance that someone in the lineage broke samaya. This is akin to a king being unsure of who fathered his son and heir, which is the example Āryadeva used.

This is why my guru counseled me that is was best to practice new termas, and discouraged me from practicing older termas like Longchen Nyinthig, etc.

As for HHDL's comment, I don't think there are very many awakened masters or perfectly devoted students at all in this age of the five degenerations.

I have good reason to believe for example, that Sogyal R did not go through this process and never went deep into Tsa lung teachings, ( ruling out peoples fantasies of him practicing union practice.)

Another patriarchal idea from Tibetan culture, and not Dharma. Why is the bone lineage more important than the blood lineage? It takes both semen and an ovum to make a human being. Our fathers did not carry us in their bodies, suckle us on their breasts, change our shitty diapers and so on.

Sonam Wangchug said:
While I am sure this idea might also meet some resistance, but it's also said that for example in the case of the Mindroling and Sakya family lineages previous members made aspiration prayers that may bodhisattvas take birth through their family, which is one reason why people from those families are revered. The Dudjom family has incarnated as an auspicious mandala, and if one goes into deeper detail one can reveal how the members are all connected from their previous lives.

There are a lot of ideas like this among Tibetan families. They are very nice ideas, and they are even possible. Even in the Pali canon Buddha mentions that people who love each other can aspire to be born near each other in the next life.

The problem with Sogyal Rinpoche, is that I do not believe him to be an authentic Trulku of Terton Sogyal.  For me, it's clear that in that regard it is H.H Khenpo jigme phuntsok. Sogyal R has brought shame through association to the name of Terton sogyal, and the many great masters that he has hid behind.

You will not find me disagreeing with you here. Khenpo Jigphun is one of my important root gurus. Sogyal proves that the tulku system is corrupt and not to be trusted.

Some confusion above on terminology - Gender is a construct, a person's sex is biological - that's straight from my psych textbook. When doing research on people, it's sex-male, or sex-female. Of course now there's a lot more permutations but that's another story!

For me it boils down to this:
DJKR said:
I’m sorry, but we can’t bend the rules on this point. When both the giver and receiver of a Vajrayana initiation are fully aware and clear about what has happened, they must then both accept that pure perception is the main view and practice on the Vajrayana path. There is no room whatsoever for even a glimmer of an impure perception.

Secondly, there is the question of who is qualified to act as a guru. Is it just anyone who knows how to read Tibetan, has done retreat, received permission, and so on? Or is something more required? If one follows what Dzongsar writes above, it seems to be a mere transaction. Well, to me that is a very shallow view of samaya.

Also, conceptual pure vision is impure vision.

Again Malcolm's bias against DJKR becomes painfully clear here.

Malcolm wrote:
I am not biased against Dzongsar. I think he is a highly qualified teacher. I have encouraged people to study with him, if they are interested to, and I still would.

Sonam Wangchug said:
Right .. A "Highly qualified teacher." of the Vajrayana, who composes something that is "96 percent bullshit." and acts "Self indulgent." ..

Last time I checked, Highly qualified teachers in the Vajrayana posses wisdom, and therefore their compositions are not delusional.

Malcolm wrote:
We perhaps means different things by "highly qualified." What I means is that he has received valid transmissions from authentic masters, has understood what he has received, has practiced it I expect, has been entrusted to transmit those teachings to those who have faith in him, and over all has had a very good education in Sakya.

I do not however equate "highly qualified" with "highly realized," and I honestly don't at all care what other high lamas have said about his realization. One of the things I have come to learn about Tibetan culture is the gross amount of public hyperbole said about teachers. Dzongsar himself alludes to this when he points out that a) Tibetans do not seek out Sogyal as a teacher and b) that what they say in public is very different from what they say in private. Thus, I don't believe the hype.

Sonam Wangchug said:
Furthermore, genuine teachers of the Buddhadharma do not act from self indulgent motives, but rather to benefit sentient beings.

Malcolm wrote:
This is exactly the kind of hero worship that gets both students as well as teachers into trouble. Unless you are in fact a buddha you can makes errors, even if you are a genuine teacher of the Buddhadharma. Even bodhisattvas on the lower stages can act out of pride ( nga rgyal, māna ). This fetter is not eradicated entirely until one is a bodhisattva on the eighth bhumi. To repeat, even highly realized teachers on the seven impure bhumis can act out of pride and conceit.

Malcolm wrote:
I think he expresses a rather mechanical view about the subject of samaya, as if samaya is something received from a ritual because you have recited a few words after someone in an empowerment. I think a catechistic approach to three vows is a very limited view. It may not be his real view, but it is a view he has expressed in a number of pieces he has authored.

Sonam Wangchug said:
It's not about absolute authority based on worldly ambitions, it's a matter of respect and devotion for lineage masters.

Malcolm wrote:
I respect Dzongsar, but if he says something I think is poorly spoken, a.k.a. "bullshit," then I will call it as I see it. I do not respect authority for the sake of authority. One has to earn my respect. I don't just hand it out because a bunch of people say, "Oh, this is a really important lama," etc. This is one huge difference I see between Americans and Tibetans. We threw off the shackles of hereditary aristocracies more than 200 hundred years ago (though to be fair, we replaced it with the class inequalities produced by Capitalism), so we do not automatically respect someone merely because they have 1) a good family, 2) a good teacher, and last and least, 3) good personal qualities. If you read Aryadeva's 400 Verse you will discover there the Madhyamaka refutation of family lineages. And if anything, for us, good personal qualities are far more important than family lineage or teacher.

Sonam Wangchug said:
Some people seem to think Rinpoche has nothing better to do with his time then benefit from his position, (Despite the fact that for example at one of his last major events he urged people not to keep offering many things, due to his concern about them being properly used, to not create waste, and to instead donate towards Translating the words of The Buddha, if they were to want to donate.)

You can also find at the back of his most recent book The Guru drinks Bourbon that all the Proceeds were being donated by rinpoche to charity. Enough is enough of unfounded and unsubstantiated claims. Rinpoche is an authentic teacher of the dharma, and while he can have a bewildering air about him at times, if one truly observes, they will see how far reaching his vision is, and how much concern he has for the Dharma, ( not just the tibetan tradition either. )

Malcolm wrote:
You are raising objections to sentiments that have not been voiced by me.

You know, it is funny, but just the other day (Saturday) I was talking with some friends about the Sogyal thing, and I pointed out to them that there is a great difference between the activity of Trungpa and Dzongsar when one compares Sogyal to them. In other words, Sogyal's activities are rather paltry by comparison. Just because I voice a criticism of Dzongsar's statement published on Facebook, does not mean I do not recognize or support his other contributions to the Dharma.

But if I see bullshit, I will call it bullshit, even it if was said by the Buddha himself. We do not have sacred cows in Buddhadharma.

I will always reserve my right to speak out whenever I feel the need. As an American, I always reserve the right of free speech. And you can just pity me for my impure vision and wrong-headed insistence on my liberal, individualistic, Western values.

They permitted and abetted this situation, and did not shut him down in the 90's when he should have been shut down. But the attraction of devoted students, incense, beautiful statues, nice donations which can be used for your monastery and shedra back in India, and so on are powerful fumes which overcome one easily, even if you do not take a penny for yourself.

One positive development in this regard involves DJKR's own uncle, Dungse Shenphen Dawa Norbu Rinpoche, who a few years ago enthroned four female senior disciples as Lamas out of seven Lamas total. So the numbers swayed to the female in that expression of the Dudjom Tersar lineage. Perhaps this was a way of addressing these inequalities through action instead of words. I'm sure it's also because they were the most qualified however, so perhaps there was zero consideration about gender...which would also be significant.

Malcolm wrote:
Buddhadharma generally expresses itself by adapting to the needs of the people who are to be befitted by it. This does not mean there are not fractious and difficult challenges ahead, especially for Tibetan reactionary conservatives who imagine that the Dharma is going to be destroyed as it slowly adjusts itself to the needs of western liberals, whom it primarily serves in the West.

The question that must be raised is whether a Dharma culture that includes liberal, anti-patriarchal, democratic values is truly all that bad. To read some of DKJ's posts, this seems to be worse than have boiling gold poured down one's throat. How is it that the Dharma is so inflexible, so intellectually moribund, that it cannot meet the needs of a given client population? Well, I do not believe for one second that Dharma is that inflexible and intellectually moribund.

The fact is that there are more women in the Dharma in the West than there are men. This is undoubtedly one reason why Shenphen Rinpoche raised four women to be lamas. He has more female students than male students.

As to upholding the idea of genderlessness— it is true that the mind has no gender. It is equally true that our physical gender is an expression of a) our afflictive patterning and b) our mother's conduct in the womb. The point is not be gender blind, this is like the fantasy that the USA is racially blind. It isn't.

Fortunately or not, I never did take the empowerments all that seriously. Certainly not as seriously as is warranted by all discussion. I knew why I was there and also knew that I did not understand a whit of what was happening. I can't say that I still really understand it. That is certainly why I appreciated dzongsar khyentse's long albeit rambling "explanation". If only something like that had been available then! But what can we really say? We are among the first, the pioneers if you will, of dharma coming to the west. So of course there will be things we did not understand. The hazards of the first generation. And the dumb! But then, I shouldn't be quite so hard on myself. I was there for the experience, not for "enlightenment". Live and learn I guess.

Malcolm wrote:
Basically, what happens when unethical teachers breach their commitments with their students is that the establishment resorts to tribal punishment memes. This is what Orgyen Tobgyal did when he accused the students at Rigpa of breaking their samaya.

It is understandable, albeit wrong-headed. It is like claiming, "Well, you took Ramsey Bolton as your guru, and now you are just screwed— your bad."

Tantric commitments are for encouraging harmony in a Vajrayāna Sangha, and the guru is the head of that Sangha. But when a guru's unethical actions threaten that Sangha itself, there is really something for the students to to say and something for them to, and they should resist misguided traditionalists who go all Tilopa on them.

If we are talking about prostitution, it is very questionable whether this can be considered "consensual." There are a whole host of labor issues to be taken into consideration when we discuss sex workers of various kinds. Sex workers are among the most exploited workers there are.

Karma Dorje said:
Yes, I agree that the sex industry has a horrible record of exploitation, from trafficking to physical and sexual abuse, stealing of money, etc. What I am saying is that it ain't necessarily so. It's not the selling of sex for money that is exploitative, it's the current industry practice.

Malcolm wrote:
Since prostitution is rooted in patriarchy, it is probable that it will never be nonexploitative, since the economy that produces prostitutes is inherently exploitative. In a nonpatriarchal economy prostitution will not exist even though there may be sex workers of various kinds.

Ok. That follows if you already subscribe to Buddhist thought but some Advaitans also say that Atman is false/illusory in the sense that only Brahman is true -i.e there is only Brahman. Atman was never Atman and the thought of atman is subsumed within the realization of being Brahman and so on. Some advaitans even use 'unborn' when describing Brahman which muddies the waters even further.  I suppose at this point it circles back to discussion from earlier in the thread in that believing in the final realization of Brahman also constitutes a belief in some kind of transcendental super-self.

Malcolm wrote:
It constitutes belief in an ultimate, all pervading, truly existing essence. To say brahman is unborn is to say it is eternal.

Right, I suspected this would lead to meditation devas. It still doesn't explain some Advaitan's insistence that the realization of a Jivanmukti is synonomous with the erradication of any more karma coming to fruition in the future.

Swami Sivananda on Nirbija Samadhi:

"Without seeds or Samskaras [...] All the seeds or impressions are burnt by the fire of knowledge [...] all the Samskaras and Vasanas which bring on rebirths are totally freed up. All Vrittis or mental modifications that arise from the mind-lake come under restraint. The five afflictions, viz., Avidya (ignorance), Asmita (egoism), Raga-dvesha (love and hatred) and Abhinivesha (clinging to life) are destroyed and the bonds of Karma are annihilated [...] It gives Moksha (deliverance from the wheel of births and deaths). With the advent of the knowledge of the Self, ignorance vanishes. With the disappearance of the root-cause, viz., ignorance, egoism, etc., also disappear."

Is this assertion correct or are they just hanging out in the meditation realms for eons taking it to be full realization?

Malcolm wrote:
This is assertion is not correct since atman is an inherently wrong view. Since their view is wrong, they are mistaken in their meditation, and their conduct and result is also false and samsaric.

This conversation about gender equality took place near the beautiful

significant and consequential spiritual practitioners alive at that time. And
it happened more than two thousand five hundred years ago, centuries
before the Christian and Islamic religions were founded, and more than
two millennia before the French writer Olympe de Gouges published her
Declaration of the Rights of Woman and the Female Citizen in 1791 and the
English philosopher Mary Wollstonecraft added her feminist voice with A

Kirt thinks that broad commonalties, largely based in the Kadampa tradition, between the four schools counts for an orthodoxy, or that the goal of all schools is to liberated sentient beings (it is true they all give lip service to this idea).

But we all know that Tibetan culture is extremely brutal to animals (hence Patrul's' long diatribes about meat eating, agriculture practices, shearing of sheep and so on), and we also know that Tibetans were extremely brutal to each other. The aristocrats in Tibet oppressed the shit out of their subjects, all the while mouthing pretty mores about compassion, bodhicitta, and so on. I certainly do not mean to suggest, by the way that Western Capitalist culture is a vast improvement. In 1850 there were 3,204,313 slaves in bondage in the USA.

Quite frankly, so called "orthodoxy" in Tibetan Buddhism merely serves the class interests of the religious caste in Tibetan society.

This is not to say that Tibetan Buddhism has not produced thousands of awakened people, because it has — but as far as I can tell, most of these people were on the margins, like Milarepa, not connected with institutional Buddhism in Tibet, for the most part.

Actually, what this makes clear to me, is that that the relation between student and teacher is not a one way affair, in either direction.  It shows me that the relationship is one of mutual dependence, that both sides have to have an intelligent and informed attitude to the teacher-student relationship, otherwise it'll end up as a disaster (or will just be pointless).  I fail to see why this is controversial.

Malcolm wrote:
He did indeed discuss this, which I took pains to point out.

However, he still lays blame on the students who have picked a faulty guru and he still insists that if such students criticize that guru or perceives the guru as disqualified or at fault, they have broken samaya with that guru, even if in the end it is the guru's own damn fault because that guru himself broke samaya with his or students, subjecting those students to abuse — physical, sexual, financial, or emotional.

I can understand why people like Dzongsar, who have literally thousands of vajra disciples, might be anxious about the issue of samayas. You have to have a titanium stomach to bear all that broken samaya.

There are a lot of samaya heroes out there who arrogantly proclaim that that "Vajrayāna isn't for pussies." Vajrayāna machismo primarily injures woman—   it really does need to end.

 “The governing boards and management teams of Rigpa, having sought professional and spiritual advice, will assure that the following steps are taken:

1. Set up an independent investigation by a neutral third party into the various allegations that have been made.

2. Launch an international consultation process to establish both a code of conduct and a grievance process for Rigpa.

3. Establish a new spiritual advisory group to guide the Rigpa organization.

These steps are being taken by the boards and management teams of Rigpa worldwide, in a true spirit of collaboration. Channels will be established so that any member of our community has the opportunity to express their wishes, views and concerns.” (Rigpa International)

The only difference I see is whether or not some guru feels comfortable with doing so or not.

I did not make that argument.  Nor do I intend to.

I do, however, not mind being wrong.  I do not believe there have been full wangkurs given on-line, where the vidhyadhara vows are recited.  If I am wrong, so be it.  Someone can correct me with specific examples, and I will eat my proverbial hat.  If such full wangkur were in fact given, live via the internet, it would follow that, as is traditional, the explanation regarding the various samayas would also be given, in detail, just as it is, in full wangkurs, in "meat space."

Malcolm wrote:
What is the difference between the internet and sitting in a room watching the whole thing on a big screen with the lama hundreds of feet away being listened too on a local fm radio channel, and the samaya substances just being handed out to 4,000 people at the end? The samaya substances? Is that all? Geographical proximity?  As far as I can tell, the only difference between an empowerment given live online and one being given locally is the preference of the lama.

Thank you Malcolm. That's a lot of conditions to meet.

Malcolm wrote:
I think a number of different kinds of gurus are included in this list. I do not take it to mean that someone must possess all of these faults in full; but if they have enough of these faults then this passage applies to them.  "Enough" means enough of these faults which demonstrate through their conduct that these faults exist in them.

Adamantine said:
It's not clear in this excerpt as it's not addressed: in the case of an unqualified master granting Empowerment that a samaya link is not made in some way, or if a samaya link is made through the temdrel of mutual intent and the ritual enactment of the source tantric texts etc.  so I'll assume you have concluded that samaya is not transmitted from your own logical inference?

Cessation is considered an extreme in Mahāyāna, an extreme to be avoided.

A cessation is not an annihilation however. A cessation is not annihilation since an annihilation requires an existent to be destroyed. A cessation is simply the absence of a cause for arising.

The Mahamudra of Sakya Pandita, Julia Stenzel, Indian International
Journal of Buddhist Studies Volume 15 (2014)
Sakya Pandita Kunga Gyaltsen (Sa skya paˆ∂ita kun dga‘
rgyal mtshan, 1182–1251) of the Sakya school of Tibetan
Buddhism viewed Mahåmudrå practice as being solely a part of the
Tantric practice path—a path to which disciples may be introduced
only after having passed through the initiations and required stages
of the Niruttarayogatantra. He criticised the non-Tantric
Mahåmudrå approaches of Kagyü (Bka‘ brgyud) masters such as
Gampopa (Sgam po pa, 1079-1153) and Lama Zhang Tsalpa (Bla ma
Zhang tshal pa, 1123-93). The controversy between representatives
of the two schools has been discussed by Roger Jackson (1982) ,
David Jackson (1990, 1994) , and others. Western scholarship has
been less concerned, however, with the positive statements of
Sakya Pandita on Mahåmudrå, i.e. with the question of what a
correct understanding of Mahåmudrå would be in his eyes. This
fact is partly due to the secrecy with which the Sakya School
handles Tantric texts. However, in a dialogue (dris lan) text in the
collected works of the Sakya masters (Sa skya bka’’bum), Sakya
Pandita gives a short account of the topic in response to questions
posed by Tokden Gyan (Rtogs ldan rgyan). 1 This text, available
from the Tibetan Buddhist Resource Center and as yet
untranslated, 2 will serve as the basis for an analysis of Sakya
Pandita‘s Mahåmudrå. His presentation will be supplemented by
explanations drawn from A Clear Differentiations of the Three
Codes, 3 and Taking the Result as the Path (Stearns 2006) . Since
controversies and debates have the advantage of clarifying
divergent viewpoints by highlighting crucial differences, I will
include a discussion of the Kagyü Mahåmudrå approaches that
Sapan criticizes wherever it seems helpful in illuminating Sakya
Pandita‘s standpoint. For this part of the research, I will rely on the
Western scholarship mentioned previously. My analysis does not
aim at justifying either side of the controversy. Both Sakya and
Kagyü Schools have continuously taught their respective
meditation systems for nearly a millennium, which I like to see as a
proof that a significant number of individuals have found meaning
in their divergent approaches. As Western scholars and
practitioners explore Tibetan Buddhism, it is important to
understand controversial positions as thoroughly as the secret
content of the debated material allows, so as not to perpetuate a
thousand year-old debate on the basis of partial information. It is
my hope that this paper contributes to clarifying the position of
Sakya Pandita in the Mahåmudrå controversy.

These are the warning signs of broken samaya:
various misfortunes arise,

various contagious diseases occur,

If one is killed, one becomes a hell being. 
One’s eyes cannot see form. 
One cannot hear and one’s work cannot be done.
Leprosy and blistering diseases arise.

If you do understand the commitments, you do know what you are doing, and so on, a teacher's conduct has to be pretty outrageously abusive before you can legitimately say, this teacher has broken samaya and now my commitment to him or her is null and void. If he or she likes fancy cars, too bad; if they like expensive food and wine; too bad. If they have a penchant for gold and silver, and insist that their students pay outrageous fees for teachings, too bad. If they like having multiple partners and are up front about it, too bad. If they are gay, too bad. If they are trans, too bad.

But if they systematically abuse their power, or are dishonest, or are physically and/or sexually abusive, well, then one might have a case that this teacher is bad news. Even here, it is best to just leave their company and move on. However, sometimes it is bad enough to warrant a public outing. In this case, don't worry about your samaya, your obligation to sentient beings is more important.

@Malcolm,

I argued previously that: (see https://dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f ... 00#p399627 )

When something is dependently arisen, it implies that the something is not unconditioned. If you assert that emptiness is dependent arising or dependent co-arising, and if you also assert that emptiness is empty as well, then you would be implying that emptiness is not unconditioned. Your reply did not address the logical problem raised.

So far, you have avoided addressing this issue.  If you want to resolve the logical conundrum, you have to look more closely at what dependent arising is.  If you take dependent arising as strictly a temporal causal chain, you cannot get out of this conundrum.  If you cannot get out of this conundrum, you will have to take the view that there cannot be an ultimate because of dependent arising and merely asset that emptiness is unconditioned even when the emptiness of emptiness implies otherwise, which is exactly what you have done.  So I am not surprised by your position.

Anyway, I think I have already stated my position and the relevant supporting arguments.  Until the above is addressed, the debate will not end.  So I am going to leave this discussion until such time you address the logical conundrum that I posed.

I have not addressed the issue because it is a nonissue. Whatever arises in dependence (relative truth) is empty (ultimate truth).  The two truths are inseparable.

It is only possible to believe this if one thinks that merely attending a ritual and repeating some words has the power to confer samaya. I don't believe this, but you are free to disagree.

Not sure what the Rigpa Rangshar says, I will have a read if you can qoute the full tibetan title. But from the common three-vows commentaries, which translation are available, I don't see Malcom's definition in it.

Malcolm wrote:
Honestly, the three vows literature is filled with nonsense. It is principally polemical in nature, thanks to Sakya Pandita, and there are so many contradictory opinions as to render this whole class of polemical literature basically useless as a guide for what one is to accept and reject unless one should stay in the narrow silo of a particular interpretation. It is a technical literatures for scholars with too much time on their hands and who do not practice enough. It is not a literature which will clearly explain to one how one is to practice the three vows. For example, Sapan claims it is ridiculous to expect that someone who has not received full ordination should nevertheless follow all the vows of a fully ordained monk or nun, and at the same time, we see other famous presentations of this literature which insists that this is the case. Sapan claims the three vows do not have one intention; but in Drigung it is clearly held that they do. Thus, there is no common three vows literature. Sapan claims it is absurd to dedicate merit to the dharmadhātu, etc. There are so many points of disagreement and the whole of the three vows literature was spawned by Sapan's polemics.

narraboth said:
I also don't think a person needs to be ''realised" (to what degree??) to perform a valid empowerment ritual (pointing out teaching is another issue). At least not in Sakya's view from what I heard. We need to be extremely careful here. If I have chance to meet HHST again I will try to ask.

Malcolm wrote:
If a person who is not realized performs a qualified rite, with all the bells and whistles, in a proper way, that empowerment is valid as far as it goes. It can serve as a basis for someone's practice of this or that sadhana. But the unrealized person giving that empowerment cannot expect that he or she has bestowed much in the way of samaya, especially if their own samaya is not really in perfect order. In any case, the notion of the 22 common samayas is a scholastic construct. There is no tantra that gives a defined list of 14 root and 8 branch samayas.

narraboth said:
To push further, I have been in Rigpa centre limited time listening to other masters' teaching. I don't think the consequences of samaya breakage were not mentioned; I heard Kyabje Trulshik Rinpoche talked about it and it was translated, emphasized and repeated again. If it was mentioned too late or not I don't know. People were already there, bought tickets, paid for the meals and beds.... like almost every major event in other places. You can of course say it was too loose, but again, that doesn't make students free from samaya.

Malcolm wrote:
Were we talking about Trulshik Rinpoche? I don't think so. We were talking about what happens when unrealized teachers give empowerments to poorly prepared students — which has unfortunately become the rule, rather than the exception.

I know of at least one example where a teacher accused his student of completely breaking samaya, telling others this person was going to hell. This student, understandably upset, went to Tulku Nyima Gyaltsen and explained the situation. Tulku Nyima Gyaltsen's reply was that the Tibetan teacher granting the empowerment was not qualified to give empowerments at all (despite having done three year retreat, being a recognized tulku, etc.) and the student in question had no samaya to break despite being the sponsor for the empowerment in question.

Thus, the picture painted by some within the tradition of an inviolable bond with absolutely strict and mechanical outcomes (the old snake in a tube example) seems to be rather not as hard and fast as some teachers and students imagine.

narraboth said:
The only way I find to get around is, I don't think SR gave full empowerment often.

Malcolm wrote:
I think this class of statement betrays an attachment to rules and rituals. This is a fetter, no matter what level of Buddhadharma we practice. As I mentioned above, attachment to rules and rituals is a huge problem in Vajrayāna in general. It makes people very superstitious, which is why the Buddha identified attachment to rules and rituals as one of the ten fetters to begin with.

narraboth said:
Most of time he invited other lama to do so, or because it's me only go there when my own guru visiting. Actually, when did SR last time gave a full empowerment??  That makes a big difference on the guru-students relationship. Indeed, dzogchen pointing out teaching also counts, but I think that's a different requirement for qualification and that might actually more suit Malcom's definition.

Malcolm wrote:
Thinking the mechanical attendance of an empowerment creates samaya is just superstition. Samaya is a seed that slowly grows into a tree. Sometimes that seed is nonviable, because of 1) the soil in which it is planted is not properly prepared, or 2) because the gardener is inept.

However, promising infernal consequences if someone busts a teacher purporting to teach Vajrayāna and give Vajrayāna teachings when they behave in a manner which proves they are not at all qualified to care for students is fundamentalism of the worst kind. I don't accept that, it does not make common sense, it is not just, it is not right, and should be protested vigorously.

Malcolm wrote:
Most of the piece was self-indulgent babble. The essence of the bullshit in this piece is that Dzongsar blames students for rejecting and abandoning deluded gurus when those students find out about the delusion of their deluded guru. It is not fair, it is not rational, and it is pure superstition to imagine that attending a ritual, no matter how profound and meaningful when administered by a realized person to a group of well prepared students, creates an irreversible bond when administered by foolish and deluded teachers. No one imagines that attending a monastic ordination lead by a madman would have any force at all. Such thinking represents the worst example of the fetter of attachment to rules and rituals. Indeed, this whole idea comes from such fettered thinking.

Why should we imagine that empowerments administered to poorly educated Western Dharma students by deluded fools who imagine themselves gurus, whether Tibetan or any other ethnicity, would have any binding power via samaya other than through accepting an irrational interpretation of how rites that impart Vajrayāna vows actually function? Most people have no idea what is happening when they attend empowerments. They do not understand the visualizations as they happen, and so on. Even if the gurus in question are realized, if the student does not understand what is going on, no samaya is transmitted.

I would suggest, honestly, that there are probably few people who actually have samaya at all among so called Vajrayāna students—— by and large because they have no idea what is happening during empowerments, direct introductions, and so on. There is no magic bond created by an empowerment, none whatsoever. The only true bond or samaya we have is our understanding of Dharma, how deep it goes, and our appreciation of the teacher and community within which this blossoms.

The other samayas are relative. But it is the relative ones that receive all the attention. Even in terms of relative samaya, samaya is something that gradually builds, matures, and becomes deeper as the student matures in their understanding of profound Secret Mantra.

I would suggest also that there are very few gurus alive today who can actually impart samayas, since they have not realized the meaning of the teachings they are imparting. I will discuss this in the conclusion.

When we think about debacles like Rikpa (as it presently exists), we should not even be discussing the issue of breaking samaya. First of all it is bad for the students. It demoralizes them. Secondly, we are not sure that they have samaya from Sogyal. It has yet to be determined that he ever was a qualified teacher. If he was never a qualified teacher, they never received samaya. When we read comments such as the one below it is seem very questionable whether Sogyal is a qualified teacher, (the part of the article which is not bullshit, apart from just a little):
I know a little about Sogyal Rinpoche because I have visited several Rigpa centres and have witnessed the Rigpa set-up first hand. To be frank, I didn’t see enough evidence to convince me that the appropriate warnings had been given, or that adequate foundations had been laid, or that the fundamental teachings were properly given. On several occasions it seemed to me that some of the students had been Christians until perhaps the day before they attended the teaching, then suddenly, 24-hours later, they were hearing about guru devotion, receiving pointing out instructions and practising Guru Yoga – it was as extreme as that.

If that’s how it happened – if no proper warnings and no fundamental training were given prior to the Vajrayana teachings¬ ¬– then Sogyal Rinpoche is even more in the wrong than his critical students. Why? Because it is his responsibility to prepare the ground in accordance with the Vajrayana’s prescribed and well-established foundation teachings and practice. There is no question that the person with the greater knowledge, power and therefore responsibility is also more culpable when those obligations are not fulfilled.
If Sogyal is in the wrong, and did not prepare his students properly, this automatically means he is an unqualified teacher and his students have no samaya with him at all, apart from as a Vajra brother. If Sogyal is in the wrong, it is axiomatic that his critical students are not in the wrong at all, from a samaya point of view, and thus this line is bullshit because they have no samaya with him.

Dzongsar also says this, which is 2% bullshit, 96% ok, and 2% requires a little more comment. Ok part in green; bullshit part in red, other part in orange:
If the teacher and student have reached a genuine understanding about the path being practised, and if all the necessary and appropriate foundations have been laid and a clear idea of possible consequences conveyed, but the student still has a wrong view and acts on it by slandering and criticizing the teacher, then, according to tantra, that student will face grave and unimaginable consequences. 

But the same also applies to the teacher. In fact, if the teacher hasn’t laid the proper foundations, if the teacher takes advantage of a student physically, emotionally or financially, and if the teacher gives the highest yoga tantric teachings to those who have not established a proper foundation and as a result an immature student breaks the most fundamental root samayas, then the teacher will also suffer extremely grave consequences – consequences even more serious and terrible than those faced by the student.
With respect to the section marked in orange: the serious and terrible consequences to a student that has been taken advantage of by a guru or teacher is that their trust in Dharma might be damaged for some time in this life or even multiple lifetimes, and they may suffering secret obstacles which prevent them from applying the Dharma. This is what renders the broken samaya of a teacher irreparable.

In short, people should consult the Rigpa Rangshar's chapter on samaya and cease laying blame on blameless students who have the misfortune of choosing mad guides. It not fair, it is not just, it is not right, it is not rational, and should not be accepted regardless of what the traditions seems to say on the matter because to take all this literally is merely an expression of the fetter of attachment to rules and rituals. What do I mean by "literally?" By "literal" I mean that empowerments given by gurus who are not truly realized have very little force. They have very little force to produce realization in their disciples, for many, many reasons. Likewise, they also have very little power to impart any real samaya.

The reasons why we see so much broken samaya today is not the fault of students, it is the fault of too many unrealized teachers giving empowerments which they are not qualified to give in the first place.

Oh, and BTW, bringing up Naropa and Tilopa, etc. is bullshit. Please stop doing it. The twelves trials are just stories, didactic stories to show what a huge egotist Naropa was. They doubtless have some basis, but they are exaggerated way beyond anything anyone can reasonably accept as anything other than Indian/Tibetan dramatic hyperbole.

Thank you.


Malcolm wrote:
Nirvana is the cessation of afflictions, and parinirvana is cessation of birth. The latter is an extreme because if buddhas cease in fact they cannot directly benefit anyone. Mahāyāna nirvana is called "non-abiding." This means though in one's continuum afflictions for rebirth in samsara has ceased, upon attaining buddhahood one continues to benefit sentient beings directly until samsara is emptied.

On the other hand, the Dzogchen view is stated succinctly by Mañjuśrīmitra:
Since the awakening of the sugata does not exist, his magical apparitions appear to the deluded, similar to an illusion.
Mipham comments on this line:
Since the awakening of the sugata does not exist, his magical apparition, while a false appearance, appears to the deluded, similar to an illusion.
As for your second question, it is exactly the same as the example of a liquid substance that appears differently for the being of the six realms.

Sherab said:
The consequence is the same.  When there is no ultimate reality, there is then only the relative reality.  If there is only the relative reality, then it is its own ultimate reality.

Malcolm wrote:
Only dependently originated entities are "real" (nondependent entities like space and cessations are not "real," i.e. they have no putative state of being at all), either perceived falsely (relative truth), or correctly (ultimate truth).

The reason why, in Mahāyana, dependently originated entities are likened to space is that they are not actually real; they only appear to be real when essences are imputed to them. The reason that in Mahāyāna it is said that all phenomena are in the state of nirvana from the start is because as Mañjuṥrī points out, whatever arises in dependence does not truly arise. Nirvana is a cessation. Nirvana does not arise.

Sherab said:
The ultimate, like the relative, is free from the two extremes.  They are functional.  That is why when the word 'unconditioned' is applied to the ultimate, one must not assumed immediately that 'unconditioned' means 'permanence'.

The relative is but an emergent thingy of the ultimate.  That is why the relative can be argued as being an illusion.  It is also why the relative can never be separated from the ultimate because without the ultimate, there is no possibility of an illusory relative.

The Buddhist ultimate truth is strictly a veridical perception (either analytical or nonanalytical) of any entity (whether conditioned or unconditioned).

Similarly, one cannot speak of the nonexistence of a given thing which has ceased because there is no given thing there to talk about. Fundamentaly, cessation is the absence of a cause, either through insight, or naturally, like a burnt seed. We cannot speak properly of the nonexistence of a shoot from a burnt seed because such a thing never existed from the start. All we can say is "That seed will not germinate." Likewise, of an arhat one can only say, "He or she will not be born."

When one understands that nothing can be established in any of the four extremes in anyway whatsoever outside of conventions, then one has a slight glimpse of the wisdom of the Buddha. As long as one insists there is an  atemporal, unsupported, unfabricated, unmanifest, ineffable and self-arising in contrast to the the temporal, supported, fabricated, manifest, effable and arising from another one has not escaped from any extreme at all. One is still trapped in the two extremes of permanence (the atemporal, unsupported, unfabricated, unmanifest, ineffable and self-arising) and annihilation (the temporal, supported, fabricated, manifest, effable and arising from another). I am surprised that do not easily see the flaw in your reasoning.

Statements are conventions and do not require any ultimate basis in order to accepted conventionally, i.e., nonanalytically. Not does analysis of conventions such as arising require some ultimate basis in order to ascertain they are false. Conventions can be examined and found false without any reference at all to any ultimate basis. To suggest otherwise is fall prey to the kind of pathological, realist substantialism the Buddha's Dharma is meant to cure.

I repeat, conventions require no ultimate basis in order to be conventionally true.

In worldly conventional perception things appear to arise from causes and conditions. MMK 1:1
No thing arises at any time, anywhere
from itself, from other than itself, or without a cause.
When analyzed it is found there are no causes and no conditions — this analysis forms the entire body of the rest of the MMK -- arising from conditions is merely a convention and when investigated no arising can be found at all (and thus no abiding or perishing either).

You must have real difficulties reading Nāgārjuna:
Since arising, abiding, and perishing are not established, the conditioned is not established. 
Since the conditioned is never established, how can the unconditioned ever be established?
In light of the above, I think you may wish to retract your hasty and erroneous critique,

For example, there is a famous traditional story. Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo, one of the few famous Tibetan who really attained buddhahood, was pestered by some monks who were unhappy with the newly recognized tulku for their monastery, so they pestered him with their doubts.

After growing a little impatient with them, he said, "Let's go see your lama."

He led to them to the cattle yard, and called out the recently deceased lama's name. A young bull calf trotted over. "There" Khyentse said, "This is your lama."

The Tibetan penchant for devotional hyperbole is hard for westerners to deal with. We tend to take everything so literally.

This is a huge misconception that has arisen from a mistaken Chinese translation of the term "sprul sku" as "living buddha."

There are several kinds of tulkus. The kind of tulku we mostly encounter are "blessed" tulkus. The process of enthroning them is virtually identical with consecrating a buddha statue. We find a small boy, with proper signs, maybe they even correctly pick out some of the items of their predecessor. With this done, they are blessed as the incarnation of their predecessor and the rest is history. The process of identifying candidates is an art, not a science, and sometimes great political turmoil arises because of disagreements among senior monastics over who is the "right" choice.

The kind of tulku who is a living buddha is generally a self-proclaimed incarnation, not a recognized incarnation.

Also, the modern Tibetan Buddhist establishment, recognizing the kind of misunderstandings that arise from the use of the term tulku for reincarnations has taken to calling them yang srid, rebirths, rather than tulkus.

Though you may find methods of introduction described in some books, for example, some lengthy Mahāmudra manuals come to mind, they must be received from a teacher who has realized the meaning of such instructions in themselves because such methods are experiential, not intellectual.

If someone wishes experiential training in the nature of the mind, one should find an old master who has done many years of retreat and who has also guided many students personally. One must do whatever it is he or she might command. In general, one will not be able to receive such teachings from famous teachers, with a very, very, short list of exceptions.

The key words are "should one choose to inquire". Sadly, the more common condition is external inquiry into the external world for answers only, where the inner world is ignored,  is it not. Thus outer, inner, and non-dual realization is implied in realizing the nature of mind; while ignorance (marigpa) is the semi-static condition where the inquiry has failed. For example, meditation.

Malcolm wrote:
People do not even know they should inquire.

Many people seek inwardly for answers too, but not recognizing the right questions to ask, they come up with many incorrect answers.

If you want to know the secret guru, first you must discover the inner guru; and to discover that inner guru, a realized outer guru is indispensable.

People have a very huge misconception about gurus, particularly in Dzogchen teachings. No guru is going to hand you awakening in their hand, or pick out the perfect yidam for you to practice, or give you a tailor made path to buddhahood. But they can transmit their own knowledge of the teachings, and help you encounter your own state directly. A realized guru is indispensable in this case. In Dzogchen and Mahāmūdra, an unrealized guru, however, is a serial killer of disciples. An unrealized guru can set one back many lifetimes. An unrealized guru breaks their own samaya the minute they open their mouths.

There is no living tradition of the sTon mun (Chan) tradition which has survived in Tibet, though perhaps there is a vestigal remnant of it in the Kagyu Mahāmudra tradition.

However, the clearest explanation of these traditions as they existed in Tibet may be found in the The Lamp of the Eye of Dhyāna by Nubchen Sangye Yeshe. Here it is clearly explained with respect to sūtrayāna systems, the Chan tradition's view and practice is much superior to the Indian system of view and practice brought to Tibet as presented to the Tibetans by Kamalashila. Without this background, I am afraid Tibetan Zen will be rather obtuse.

As evidenced by the preservation of a debate in an 11th century text by Mañjusȓīkirti, there was a serious debate in the mid 8th century between Indian exponents of the tradition we now term "The Great Perfection" (Śrī Singha being mentioned by name) and a more gradualist style of Vajrayāna which came to be the normative position. However, echoes of the earlier Indian nongradual tradition may be found in some of the Mahāmudra dohas, especially those of Saraha. Klaus Dieter Mathis has done some remarkable work in this area.

No, socialism is too bound up with class hierarchy to even approach anarchism. Socialism is also a product of patriarchy, and bears the faults of it as well.

Again, depends on how you construe the label. Orton was right, in his time, to distance himself from the neoliberal atrocity that was then trying to pass for the socialist alternative.
I don't really agree with this assessment. Orton distanced himself from socialism for this reason, among others:
It seems to me that “socialism” or “ecosocialism”, as a description of a future deep ecology-inspired and socially just post-capitalist society, is not adequate or inspirational. The type of future ecocentric and socially just social formations is up for discussion. There are no worked out social models that can be simply adopted. Socialism is in many ways an expression of the industrial proletariat, and while its legacy of social justice remains valid, and indeed needed for a future ecocentric society, it is not correct to say that “ecosocialism” will describe the future post-industrial ecocentric society. The features of such a society are a work in progress for all of us to engage with.

Mélenchon is just an old school leftist. The old left is precisely what Orton is criticizing. Even Bookchin departed from his old left roots in the formation of his libertarian municipalism (with which I am sympathetic, but think it is too anthropocentric), despite his trenchant materialism. Frankly, I have not seen an ecosocialist analysis that goes beyond Saral Sarkar's ecological dictatorship of the proletariat.

I have seen quite a few. It seems to me that your definition of socialism is much narrower than mine. As far as I am concerned, Bookchin is a socialist -- a libertarian socialist, libertarian-municipalist socialist, to be exact, but socialist nonetheless.

Bookchin self-identified as an anarchist.

Orton was one as well -- and it was Orton who created late in the 90s the cornerstone of deep green socialism ("left biocentrism") that, as a living political platform, is still to come.

Left -biocentrism is also not socialist, from the Left Biocentric Primer:

treehuggingoctopus said:
"Left" as used in left biocentrism, means anti-industrial and anti-capitalist, but not necessarily socialist.
There are few sets of eco-friendly political platforms in the West which might help foster a genuinely left movement that is also really and truly biocentric. One of them is obviously European Greens. Another is the broad array of socialist parties. Yet another is, however surprising it may be, the so-called Catholic Left, rallying around Francis (the green encyclical proves that the Catholic church is presently undergoing a sea-change in this respect: http://earthministry.org/wp-content/upl ... ato-Si.pdf ).

What most people do not understand about deep ecology is that it has room for many different level 1 principles —Buddhist, Taoist, Muslim, Hindu, Christian, Philosophical, Socialist, etc.— which will lead to a deep ecological view, which is level 2 (levels three and four, where social ecology finds it best expression, is pragmatic, as well as and policy/solution oriented, but also necessarily shallow).

What eco-socialists and the Bookchinites fail to grasp and constantly criticize is the diversity of level 1 principles that can lead to a deep ecological perspective. Sarkar, Bookchin, and other materialist thinkers in the ecology movement devote/waste an enormous amount of time criticizing the spiritual and philosophical underpinnings of the deep ecological view, because of traditional left wing dogmatism and intellectual rigidity that continues to infect the materialist left to this day. They completely miss the point that how one arrives at one's ecological view is far less important than the fact that one has arrived at it, and thus they persistently act and behave in ways counterproductive to the ecological movement as a whole — it is for this reason and this reason alone the Green Parties are so ineffective.

HHDL and others have said that present circumstances demand to unveil them and make them public. I agree.

Publishing books does not negate the need for proper transmissions of the teachings contained in those books from qualified teachers who actually understand those teachings and how to present them properly and to whom.

People who post wildly inaccurate translations on the internet, present their misunderstandings of the same, incapable of actually recognizing the content of the teachings they supposedly are presenting, and then defend their error under the mistaken belief they have been given a mandate to do so by HHDL, are more deluded than deluded.
