That's at the time of transfer. They talk of dharmakaya appearing as blueness and the form kayas are latent until sentient beings get involved when it can appear as any deity.

Also Saraha refutes this idea that Mahāmudra realization is the cesssation of perception:
“For the knowledge of the ultimate, oh sir, look with your eyes! I didn’t realize anything more than this. If you want realization, that is everything.”
Also Kotalipa:
“From looking with the eye organ, non-dual wisdom is amazing!”
Yangonpa, the famed Drukap Kagyu master states:

Luminous clarity is without appearances and free from extremes but mahāmudrā is fresh appearance and knowing, and because proliferation is self-liberated, it is different than luminous clarity.
He continues:

That is not the objects of focus or the creation of a deity form, luminous clarity, or emptiness,  bliss, non-conceptuality, and so on. There might be a deity form, there might be a ghost. There might be bliss, there might be suffering. There might be appearances, there might be emptiness. There might be luminous clarity, [5/a] there might be signs. There might be conceptuality, there might be non-conceptuality, whatever it may be, it is not established in truth. It is enough in its own state.

It so happens that in the past some pracititioners of the Great Perfection

And:
The way that great transference body arises:
when all visions have gradually been exhausted,
when one focuses one’s consciousness on the appearances strewn about
on the luminous maṇḍala of the five fingers of one’s hand,
the environment and inhabitants of the universe
returning from that appearance are perceived as like the moon in the water.
One’s body is just a reflection,
self-apparent as the illusory body of pristine consciousness;
externally and internally pellucid; free from being harmed by the four elements;
one obtains a vajra-like body.
One sees one’s body as transparent inside and out. 
The impure eyes of others cannot see one’s body as transparent, 
but only the body as it was before;
for example, when the hand of Mutri Tsanpo touched
the body of Master Padmasambhava,
according to account of their meeting.

Interestingly enough;

Yet, the most influential contact he [Merton] made was with the Buddhist teacher, Chatral Rinpoche, a monk who had spent more than thirty years in the solitary contemplation that was Merton's only real home in this world. It was Chatral Rinpoche who identified Merton as a pratyekabhudda, and with whom Merton would take a variant of the Boddhisatva's vows, in which he dedicated himself to do all he could to reach enlightenment for the benefit of all beings, in this lifetime or the next.

Because they single themselves out. For example, Gyalpo Rinpoche writes:
The manner of explaining the strength, definition and qualities, and the view, meditation and behavior of devotion, etc., in this lineage does not resemble others...
He explained that devotion was a special point of the Kagyu lineage, following Dgongs gcig:
Devotion alone is the method of giving rise to all realization.
He polemically responds to Sakya Paṇḍita, saying the following:

How can there be any doubt, therefore, that supplication to the victorious fathers and sons of the Kagyus will cause the blessings to enter?
And then going on the quote Karma Chagme:
Because a Guru possessing all qualifications today is rare, supplicating the lineage of the victorious fathers and sons of the Kagyus is good on its own. The activity of the Buddhas arrives because of their intent.
So that is why I singled out the Kagyus.

Malcolm wrote:
The idea that "blessings" come from supplicating gurus or from disciples offering supplications is both equally wrong. The dog tooth story is a perfect example of some of the hardcore silliness we can find in Tibetan Buddhism. It is a tale to silence inquisitive children.

Nevertheless, I will happily sing blessing supplications because I am grateful for the path that my gurus have shown me. But just as I don't really believe that gathering the two accumulations is necessary for buddhahood, likewise, I don't really believe in external blessings.

And the point of my example about the Pope is that he gives blessings a.k.a benedictions, for a living. It is his main job. This is the Christian approach to spirituality in general, i.e., appealing to a higher power. But the Buddha is not a "higher" power -- he is merely someone who understood his own nature and became free of the afflictions that bound him to samsara. A guru is also not a higher power, he or she is someone that shows us the path. Meeting the path of Dharma is the real blessing, besides which all other so-called "blessings" pale into insignificance.

In any case, it is interesting to note that in the bka' 'gyur, the term byin rlab, brlabs and rlob occur infrequently in the sūtra division. There are 4 instances in the perfection of wisdom section; 51 instances in the Avatamska; 7 instances in the Ratnakuta collection and 53 instances in the general sūtra division. This is out of millions of words.

In the tantra division of course, because it is concerned with ritual actions, primarily, there are 740 instances of this term.

By way of comparison, the term emptiness occurs 27 times in Vinaya, 1000+ times in the PP section; 27 times in the Avatamska, 420 in the Ratnakuta, 1000+ in the general sutra division; and 464 in the tantra division.

When we run a comparative analysis on the tantra division with guru and blessing combined, we find that the "blessing" relationship between guru and disciple is framed as a contractual obligation, as in this passage from the Vajrāmṛta Tantra:
After the disciple fully offers 
his wealth to the guru,
the blessings of the guru
should be granted to the sadhaka.
But apart from this passage, there are no others in the tantras themselves. In the commentarial literature, the use of the term "blessings of the guru" are generally restricted to empowerment contexts. But of course, there are rare statements such as Virupa's:
Siddhi is obtained in an instant,
based on the blessings of the guru.
Naturally, as we move down into the commentaries on lower tantra, yoga tantra on down, references to the blessings of the guru disappear.

Such references are only found in the anuttarayoga tantra commentaries because guru yoga is strictly an highest yoga tantra thing.

Finally, the term "guru endowed with the lineage of blessings" entirely refers, in Indian literature, to someone who is actually authorized to bestow this or that empowerment, i.e. someone who has the adhiṣṭhāna (n. standing by , being at hand , approach ; standing or resting upon ; a basis , base ; the standing-place of the warrior upon the car Sa1mavBr. ; a position , site , residence , abode , seat ; a settlement , town , standing over ; government , authority , power ; a precedent , rule ; a benediction Buddh.) of the lineage.

Now of course, things in Tibet are different, especially in the Kagyu school, and Tibetans overall have moved way beyond the limited notion of "blessings" found in the Indian canon, where we can see common Tibetans (the prayer wheel spinning types) placing fervent, often blind, devotion in tulkus, abbots, geshes, and so on., whether deserved or not.

To me , when mind is engaged by saying "this is sweet"  and restricting the appearance of sensation to this frame of reference , is what i would call conceptualization . But i would not say that the naked experience of sensation , which is prior to mind being engaged , is the conceptualization itself.

A direct perception is not prior to the mind, per se. A direct perception is a nonconceptual mind. A nonconceptual mind does however exist prior to the arising of the mental faculty, manas, which interprets that nonconceptual mind.

They need not be heretical, you know. His saying that "the ground of our minds is the same" may be construed as perfectly orthodox (meaning there is just one nature of the mind, not that we are all a Brahman-like multientity) -- and the same applies to the instructions he has received from Khenpo Munsel (see here: http://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.ph ... 4&p=226936 ).

Even this bit does not necessarily suggest that we are all Borg:

Garchen Rinpoche said:
[...]the essence of the suffering of the sentient beings of the three realms and the essence of our own suffering is the same. If you see them to be the same, if you see them as being non-dual, and then meditate on that suffering, in the mind's natural state, that suffering goes away. At that moment, you have been able to lessen the suffering of all sentient beings of the three realms, all at once.

treehuggingoctopus said:
I mean, if you can dedicate your practice for the benefit of others (and they do benefit from it somehow), why would you not be able to use tonglen like that? We are all connected, after all.


Malcolm wrote:
If we understand such instructions as being an experience on the path, with no real function outside of the practitioner's personal experience, there is no problem with such instructions. For example, it is well know that buddhas only see sentient beings as buddhas. But the fact that buddhas see us as buddhas does not diminish our own obscured experience, our own impure vision, one iota.

If we, in a state of delusion, think we are in fact really removing the illnesses and misery of others through gtong len practice, for example, we have not understood one word of what gtong len teachings are in actuality— a method of developing the courage necessary to make the leap from aspirational bodhicitta to engaged bodhicitta.

Here's another thing about guru yoga. Sure Hevajra says blessing comes from making offerings to the guru and ones own merit. But I'd argue the effect or feeling you get from any guru yoga you can also get from visualization of one hand implement of a deity. So all these mandala offerings and beseeching prayers to transfer blessing are really doing something else: they are habituating you to want it so bad you won't quit. Dzogchen is doing GY like my hand implement. It's reasoning what is the essence of the guru and the lineage and boiling it down to a symbol. If a master can make all that clear,mother that's an amazing master. The others are running an outfit, with teaching policies and such, based only ancient attitudes, like Olympic repetitions.

Here there is no method and wisdom,

"The texts" abound with controversy. The error is not in not fact checking teachings, its in drawing your own conclusions about their applicability based on your experience of them alone, a naïveté the Zen school is renowned for.

Astus said:
Isn't it the Dalai Lama who urges return to Nalanda style Buddhism when teachers were proficient in engaging with non-Buddhist thinkers? I think the error that seems to be in Garchen Rinpoche's teaching comes from being surrounded only by Buddhists. I see similar teachings in East Asian Buddhism as well that can be easily interpreted as a sort of substance/substratum doctrine. But again, I attribute the development of such terminology to the lack of an opposite party that teaches any type of eternal spirit theory, because without them there is no reason to be careful and strict in how one teaches the Dharma. Apparently in India they had to keep the sword of wisdom sharp to cut off all sorts of wrong views, and there was no place for anything that even resembles an atman.

Malcolm wrote:

Thus, while I can comment on the doctrine of those statements presented to me, I cannot comment on Garchen Rinpoche's actual point of view since I have never seen in his own writing such dictums, nor have I heard them spoken, in person or by recording.

Interestingly, the Tibetan word byin.brlabs. is glossed as "Blessing" but Tony Duff glosses brlabs.pa/rlob.pa as "to be touched by something else from a distance and affected by it."

"Being affected by" is certainly a cornerstone of Dharma, interdependence, etc., but this does not mean something is transferred or transmitted from one entity to another.

My interpretation is that devotion is both cause and result.  It is the result of hearing, reflecting, and meditating, and it is a contributing cause of realization.

Devotion is mos.gus., by the way.  mos.pa meaning "longing" and gus.pa meaning "respect."

And since  Buddhas activities are unceasing means that for as long as we stay connected to the teachings we are by implication connected to their activities(blessings).

Malcolm wrote:
Yes. However, what is the highest and best activity of the buddhas? Giving teachings. So of course, we can regard the teachings of the Buddha as a blessing. But there is no force nor blessing that will allow us to realize the meaning of those teachings unless we ourselves put them into practice. So in reality, blessings still come from us, not from the buddhas.

Malcolm wrote:
As ChNN says, if you want a blessing, go get a lama to pat you on the head. But "blessings" of this kind are not something serious.

First, we have to look at what the word really means. According to Alak Kenkar's dictionary, Bod rgya tshig mdzod, "A blessing ( byin brlabs, adhiṣṭhānam ) is the power of dwelling on a topic of the Dharma of the noble path." In other words, if you dwell on the topics of Dzogchen teachings, or any of the Buddha's teaching, that in itself is a "blessing."

Alak Kenkar adds another entry, "the four blessings" (byin rlabs bzhi), which are the blessing of truth, the blessing of generosity, the blessing of pacification, and the blessing of wisdom.

The "blessing of wisdom," according to the only source in the bstan 'gyur which defines it, Dharmakīrti's Jātakamālaṭīkā, simply means that among the six perfections, those inclined towards wisdom maintain the perfection of wisdom.

So according to these definitions, blessings refer to one's own interest in the path.

The commentary on the Ratnavali has another good definition of "blessings":
A "blessing" is any activity performed by the buddhas for bodhisattvas or done by them for the benefit of sentient beings."
So here, a blessing means some activity buddhas do on behalf of bodhisattvas or sentient beings. But it certainly does not mean that buddhas and bodhisattvas have the capacity to transfer their own realization to another.

Stong pa translates śūnya. Nyid translates tā = śūnyatā. The first part means "empty," the tā suffix is equivalent to "ness" in English, hence the term "emptiness" is really the most accurate translation of that term into English.

Here, Mingyur Rinpoche is not carefully distinguishing two different things: 1) the experience of nonconceptuality, which is often termed "the experience of emptiness" in Tibetan texts, and 2) the emptiness which is the doctrine of the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras and Madhyamaka. The latter cannot be experienced in conceptually in meditation. The former can.


Lucas Oliveira said:
Emptiness: the reality beyond reality

Mingyur Rinpoche explains emptiness, "one of the most misunderstood words" of Buddhist philosophy

“The sense of openness people experience when they simply rest their minds is known in Buddhism as emptiness, which is probably one of the most misunderstood words in Buddhist philosophy. It is hard enough for Buddhists to understand the term, but Western readers have an even more difficult time, because many of the early translations of Sanskrit and Tibetan texts interpreted emptiness as “the Void” or nothingness—mistakenly equating emptiness with the idea that nothing at all exists. Nothing could be further from the truth the Buddha sought to describe.

While the Buddha did teach that the nature of mind—in fact the nature of all phenomena—is emptiness, he didn’t mean that their nature was truly empty, like a vacuum. He said it was emptiness, which in the Tibetan language is made up of two words: tongpa-nyi. The word tongpa means “empty”, but only in the sense of something beyond our ability to perceive with our senses and our capacity to conceptualize. Maybe a better translation would be “inconceivable” or “unnamable.” The word nyi, meanwhile, doesn’t have any particular meaning in everyday Tibetan conversation. But when added to another word it conveys a sense of “possibility”—a sense that anything can arise, anything can happen. So when Buddhist talk about emptiness, we don’t mean nothingness, but rather an unlimited potential for anything to appear, change, or disappear.

Seems a little misleading, since in 2015 you were explicitly claiming to be a Buddhist teacher. Furthermore, how is what you are doing not a gross instance of appropriation? You are explicitly and extensively using Buddhist jargon, from beginning to end, from the refuge to the practices to the "goal". You can't on one hand say you are teaching "Tibetan Heart Yoga", "guru yoga", "Machig Labdron guru mantra", and "ati yoga" and then on the other pretend that you aren't trying to teach Buddhism or at least give an impression to your students that you are teaching Buddhism. What makes your Heart Yoga "Tibetan"?

Gross appropriation especially seems to be the case when you are willfully redefining terms, like "bhumi" as it pertains to the stages of a bodhisattva, to suit this end. On one hand it helps one market as if there was some relationship with traditional Bhumis, while on the other hand allows one to shield yourself from criticism since you just appeal to them being redefined.  When you could of easily just used a completely different word altogether...It seems to me to be incredibly dishonest, this whole business of being "explicitly" non-Buddhist yet implicitly Buddhist.

The moment I got the book on secret dzogchen practices by Namkhai Norbu and started reading it, I was attacked by very aggressive and violent subtle entities.

I was under a very violent attack on three consecutive days, until I figured out that these entities were the dharma protectors (dharma palas) of this particular dzogchen tradition and rinpoche. These attacks were so violent that I couldn't see with my physical eyes properly and got bad headaches. My interpretation of what happened was that these beings, dharma palas went after me because they have been programmed to do so if anyone trespassed their territory. It was like being in the ring with a professional heavy weight boxer who is out to finish you and who doesn't stop until you're knocked out. It was very serious. When I figured what was going on I burned the book and instantly carried the ashes out. The attack stopped... which was great because I finally got to recuperate. It was like having to encage in mortal combat for three days, that serious. These "dharma protectors" had attacked me so hard that my vitality had gone very low.

Of course, people will still chase after charlatans and fools, but there is little one can do to prevent that, apart from communicating the authentic requirements for entering Dzogchen teachings in a pure, guileless way.
I do not disagree with the fact that probably no one can recognise rigpa without a long committed practices, of various kinds. I recall two of my friends who are/have been very committed orthodox dzogchen-practitioners of well known and respected lineages. The other of them, who trained with his rinpoche for over 15 years, and received the highest empowerments in the tradition among other close circle students, while acknowledging the efficacy of some of it, said what many people out there say, that mostly people are seduced with foreign terms of "dzogchen" or "rigpa" but what they taught are boring lectures of emptiness and compassion that do not really explain what is talked about. Lamas are setting the carrots of "dzogchen" on front of donkeys and they start running, someday somehow hoping to be granted "dzogchen" whatever they understand it to be. Nobody explains this stuff to them, except after 12 years of a lot of doing this and that, to a small group of chosen students. This happened to my friend. He felt he'd been conned, while saying that a small part of all that he was taught during 15 years was actually of practical use. And he got the highest teachings after catching direct introduction. I've heard many such stories, also from vajrayana. So tell me, who is a fool and a charlatan? There is no transparency in orthodox dzogchen. This allows a lot of unhealthiness.

Malcolm wrote:
As I said, if you are interested in Dzogchen teachings, you need to meet an authentic master of Dzogchen. There have never been more than a few in any generation, and they are dwindling.

That said, your friend gathered the two accumulations for fifteen years. This is not insignificant, and is a necessary prerequisite to any teaching belonging to Secret Mantra. It is not like his store of merit took a nose dive.

For example, Vimalamitra notes in his commentary on the root tantra of Dzogchen, the Realms and Transformations of Sound:
Prior to those preliminaries, those sublime persons did various methods of gathering accumulations.
It is very important for any Dzogchen practitioners to engage constantly in the practice of purification and accumulation.

As to some unscrupulous teachers using the name Dzogchen to attract students in the manner of setting out beef but selling dog meat, these kinds of teachers will meet their own unsavory ends.

We just need to keep reminding people to search out and follow authentic masters of Dzogchen teachings, and not to settle for anything less. If you study with someone who advertises themselves as a teacher of Dzogchen, but they never teach Dzogchen, there is no chain binding you to that teacher.

It is not the case that there is a "traditional" way of presenting Dzogchen, as opposed to a modern way. There is only one way, and that is the way Dzogchen has been promulgated in this world since the time of Garab Dorje.

I don't have a problem holding the teachings in high regard. "But they are the property of the whole human kind.

Malcolm wrote:
No, in fact they are the property, if you want to put it that way, of the guardians of the teachings, to whom the teachings were entrusted for care and safekeeping on behalf of those of us in this degenerate era who have the karmic good fortune to meet them and be devoted to them.

Not all human beings are interested in Dzogchen just as not all human beings have a precious human birth.

Even if you explained every detail of Dzogchen teachings to them they would be like, "What the hell, I don't believe in rainbow bodies, reincarnation, etc." If you don't accept rebirth, as in every other teaching of the Buddha, you won't be able to attain liberation through Dzogchen teachings in this lifetime, the bardo or in the next life — although, as my teacher said about such people, "Maybe they can relax a little bit."

Most people are not Buddhists. Among Buddhists, very few are interested in Secret Mantra teachings, as is well illustrated by this board. Of those who are interested in Secret Mantra teachings, very few of them are interested in Dzogchen teachings. Of those people who are interested in Dzogchen teachings, very few are really that interested in practicing and studying them more than superficially. There are even fewer people, such as translators like myself, who spend the majority of their time studying and practicing these teachings.

Dzogchen teachings are rare, not because they are kept away under lock and key, Dzogchen teachings are rare because very few people have the karmic disposition and fortune to receive them. That said, anyone who is truly interested in Dzogchen teachings can go out and find a qualified teacher. One can even tune into a webcast and receive them from a qualified master for free, like right now, this week.

Kim said:
All that talk about samaya and creating obstacles. Gimme a break. That's the real tragedy.

Malcolm wrote:
Understanding that samaya must be followed and that obstacles arise from not following samaya is an integral part of Dzogchen teachings, as it is in all Secret Mantra. Its not optional — well it is, in the sense that if someone chooses not to follow samaya, no human being has the power to do anything about it. But the ḍākinīs swiftly punish those who think samaya is of no consequence at all, especially when it comes to Dzogchen teachings. Understanding the importance of samaya is foundational in Dzogchen. This is why many chapters are devoted to explaining what samayas are, both relatively and ultimately, and why it is necessary to observe them. It is not a hardship.

Guru Rinpoche made a prediction that goes something along the lines that at some point the lower vehicles of buddhism will lose their popularity and atiyoga (dzogchen) will gain popularity. I don't think it will ever happen with this pre-90's style of sharing, whether online or in person.

No, Guru Rinpoche never made such a prediction. What the Dzogchen tantras state is that Dzogchen was the first teaching at the beginning of this great eon, and will be the last to remain before this universe is destroyed.

"Recognising rigpa" was an intended choice of words I made. I didn't meant anything malicious or negative with this but I admit I did use these words to see if you'd get caught in them. I am sorry if this hurts anyones feelings here but I did this just to point out Malcolm's way of communication. It's just negation, "It's not like that". Then I'd be in a situation with a authorised dzogchen lama to ask, "How it is then? Could you clarify?", to which he'd say a difficult phrase in Tibetan or "These things are not discussed online" or "Find a lama and ask him".

Malcolm wrote:
What I am telling you is that apart from some western, self-appointed "Dzogchen" masters who imagine they can give direct introduction through email, no Dzogchen master worth their salt on the face of the planet thinks that it is sufficient to read some techniques derived from Dzogchen teachings and try to apply them without having been introduced to Dzogchen in a proper way. Of course, people will still chase after charlatans and fools, but there is little one can do to prevent that, apart from communicating the authentic requirements for entering Dzogchen teachings in a pure, guileless way.

Kim said:
I certainly am not saying that how things are said in Tibetan are worthless. Of course not. It's just that clearly discussion here is getting caught on things that are practically not that important.

Malcolm wrote:
Receiving Dzogchen teachings in the proper way, i.e., through receiving empowerments, reading transmissions and guidance on those from a qualified master is the most important point of all, one that I share over and over again, and will continue to share for as long as breath does not leave my body. It is the most helpful observation one can make. Why? Because I have received the three series of Dzogchen teachings from four notable masters, one whom is still with us [ChNN], and I think they are the most precious and valuable possession of knowledge that humans beings possess and will ever possess. Therefore, I regard it as a tragic pity when people are impatient and do not take the time and effort to seek out the guidance of an authentic master, or worse, think that the tried and true method of promulgating Dzogchen teachings is, in your words, "medieval thinking."

The consequences of not entering Dzogchen teachings in the proper way are described in Dzogchen tantras as follows. The Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra states:
The faults of not obtaining the empowerment are as follows: in the bardo one is alarmed, panicked, exhausted, impeded, and one can also lose consciousness. 

While one has not yet left the body of traces, migrating beings will not see one as worthy of respect. One’s merit will be small, one’s life short, one’s enjoyments of living will be few, one will be powerless, and many obstacles will occur. Nothing will be accomplished. Those are the faults of not obtaining the empowerment for the conduct of Secret Mantra. A yogin of Secret Mantra conduct must first obtain empowerment. If empowerment is not obtained, not even the Buddha will be able to turn the wheel on the stage of a tathāgata. If the wheel cannot be turned, then the nirmanakāya will not be able to benefit migrating beings with compassion. Therefore the empowerment of the conduct of Secret Mantra must be obtained.
It continues by warning of the faults of not maintaining samaya, which is at the root of this discussion:
These are the warning signs of broken samaya:
various misfortunes arise,
diseases are rampant and harmful, 
various contagious diseases occur, 
and there are also provocations and misguiders. 
If one is killed, one becomes a hell being. 
One’s eyes cannot see form. 
One cannot hear and one’s work cannot be done.
Leprosy and blistering diseases arise. 
Thieves and royal punishments occur. 
One contracts contagious diseases others do not get. 
One’s sons and daughters die. 
The whole country arises as one’s enemy.
One’s activities become completely pointless.
Thus, this is why we should not be discussing Dzogchen teachings in any specific way online, apart from encouraging people to find qualified Dzogchen masters under which they may study and practice.

On the fault of not receiving empowerment, the Mind Mirror of Vajrasattva Tantra states:
The demonstration of the fault of not obtaining the supreme empowerment is that the yogin, for example, will be like a boatman without an oar, unable to deliver [his passengers] to the other side. If the supreme empowerment is obtained, the secret mantra that is not accomplished will be accomplished. How will secret mantra be accomplished without relying on empowerment?
It continues by describing the unqualified master:
If the master is not authentic, his scriptures are like a monkey’s.  One will enter a false path, and one will practice corrupted Secret Mantra. Since he is a misguider, he should be avoided.

I think this is misleading. What you are saying is that some westerners or non-Tibetan knowing people can practoce dzogchen, i.e. their recognition of rigpa is comprehensive enough and yet if they don't know Tibetan language they really can't teach it. This doesn't make any sense. Obviously knowing the original language is part of the equation but to go as far to say that one couldn't get people recognise rigpa, it is not reasonable statement.

Malcolm wrote:
There is no term in Tibetan, "recognize rigpa." Putting it in these terms is a huge fail. This misunderstanding exists because many people, translators included, think rig pa = awareness. Let me assure you, it does not.

Kim said:
As a general remark, I'm starting to feel that dzogchen is a bit mystified here at DW. On the other hand it seems that discussion on this forum isn't aimed at clarifying things, such as rigpa-practice, in a way that would help the participants and readers in their own practice.

Malcolm wrote:
Dzogchen is not mystified on this forum, at all.

Much of the discussion of Dzogchen on this forum concerns the elimination of errors of interpretation such as the one I refer to above. Honestly, Dzogchen, Lamdre, Mahāmudra, etc., should not be discussed on forums such as these at all. To the extent that Dzogchen is the least understood, but the most "popular" and "fashionable" teaching right now, because people have this mistaken notion that it is easy to understand, to that extent I discuss some issues and that is all. But practitioners of these teachings should not really be looking to internet boards for help. It is fine, as happens often enough, people are isolated and need references to information for this or that thing. But this is not a place for giving teachings or helping people with their "Dzogchen" practice. That is what a guru and vajra siblings are for.

So, if someone should want help with their practice, find a proper teacher of Dzogchen, follow the latter's instructions, and stop whinging about Tibetan culture, etc.


A proper student has the following qualities:
With strong faith and great diligence, 
great intelligence and without attachments, 
highly respectful, engaging in Secret Mantra conduct, 
without concepts, without mental distractions,
possessing samaya, diligent in practice, 
mindful and constant, diligent in practice,
engaging in meditation which is clear and vivid,
doing whatever the master says,
not permitting indifference towards samaya,
engaging in conduct that accords with others,
steadfastly respectful,
following a single phrase when indicated,
moreover, engaged in his own benefit,
capable of keeping secrets,
never leaving the meaning of the vajra,
giving explanations to those of great learning,
never going beyond his personal benefit, [19/a] 
without harsh words, soft-spoken,
in accord with the minds of others, 
regarding the master and the tathāgatas
as being identical —
those are the qualities of a disciple. 
Such a disciple
is said to be the proper vessel of the Great Perfection. 
The meaning of the Great Perfection’s intimate instructions
cannot be poured into a common, inferior vessel.
If the faithful pour a little of that juice
into an inferior vessel, 
the juice is lost and both are ruined. 
Therefore it must be kept secret from those who are not suitable vessels.
A student to whom Dzogchen should not be taught, is as follows:
Not making offerings or paying respect, 
practicing Secret Mantra incorrectly,
without a good family, insincere,
unintelligent, 
ignoring kindness, 
boasting of his own family,
wearing ornaments on his body,
and engaged in pointless activities —
the unexamined disciple is the enemy of the master. 
Do not explain the meaning of the Great Perfection
to those who will not practice it.

Yeah, I get this. Practicing a thing well and teaching it well are two very separate things. To teach something you have to know enough of the underlying architecture of the teaching to do that, which is completely different than just explaining your own practice.

Truthfully, there is a lot of Western Buddhist 'teaching' in the second category - someone just explaining their own experiences and opinions, it has it's value, but whether it constitutes actual Dharma teaching or something else is kind of debatable.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, when we are teaching we have to take into consideration the capacity of the student. We have to know how to address their needs, what they need to be taught.

This may be a strategy for avoiding to listen to a point of view which may make feel you unconfortable - even thought he may bring something of value : his own experience (which may not be adapted to everyone, of course).

Everyone is different, what works for someone may not work for another. I feel it's good to listen to people who do not necesseraly share the same point of view, it helps to grow.

Dzogchen tantras and teachings are a very precise method of communicating a very specific kind of knowledge ( rig pa ). The transmission of Dzogchen is in its infancy at this point. There isn't single person who is not conversant with Tibetan language that I would consider even remotely qualified to transmit Dzogchen teachings. Further, Dzogchen is very much bound up with Vajrayāna in general. People who do not understand Vajrayāna at all have no hope of really understanding the point of Dzogchen.

I don't know about the realization of any Westerner, or for that matter, any Tibetan teacher under 60, all tulkus included. But I do know about the realization of my guru, ChNN; my late guru, Kunzang Dechen Lingpa; as well as the realization of the late Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok, another of my gurus; and the realization of the late HH Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche, yet another of my gurus. All four of these people are realized Dzogchen masters.

If you are going to study Dzogchen, it is better to find a person whom you feel has realized the meaning of those teachings. Such a person's qualifications are stated in the Dzogchen tantras as follows:
The master of the intimate instructions that possesses the vajra meaning
has a positive attitude, is skillful in teaching, 
has obtained the empowerments, applies the meaning of Secret Mantra, 
understands all the inner and outer activities, 
is inseparable from the meditation deity, 
remains undistracted in samadhi,
is knowledgable in the secret tantras of Secret Mantra,
possesses the meaning of the intimate instructions of the Great Perfection,
engages in all outer and inner sadhanas, [18b]
never leaves the meaning of the view, 
gives up outer, inner, and secret activities,
is endowed with qualities like a precious jewel,
and enjoys an inexhaustible treasury.
With the cord of compassion unsevered
and the stream of affection uninterrupted,
the master and disciple are thus connected.
Such a master of the intimate instructions
should be served with one’s body, precious substances,
and very rare items.
A master to avoid is described as follows:
A master lacking a connection with a lineage of scholars, 
who is self-important, 
stupid, literal-minded, 
who does not understand the meaning of Secret Mantra, 
has harsh words for others, is boastful, 
has entered false paths, has not seen the mandala of the empowerment, disregards samaya, [18/a]
is unable to answer questions,
has little learning, and great pride —
such an unexamined master is a māra for the disciple.
He is not a master who can teach Secret Mantra
and is unable to teach the Great Perfection, Ati. 
Do not associate with such a person.
As always, with any teacher, caveat emptor.

Since he is the keeper of Dudjom Rinpoche's seat ( gdan sa ) in NA, he could also be called a " bdag chen."

bstan 'dzin ( sasanadhara ) is usually reserved for monks. It means someone who holds the tripitika, in general.

brgyud 'dzin means someone who holds this or that lineage ( brgyud, paraṃparā ).

Adamantine said:
Hmmmmnnn.... I haven't interpreted the term "lineage holder" as meaning anyone who happens to have permission to teach, or even anyone with the title "Lama", and so on. I have interpreted it to mean a great master, usually someone people refer to as "precious one" / Rinpoche, who has been given a mandate by the previous lineage holder, or terton, to oversee and work towards the preservation, continuation, maintenance and expansion of the lineage without any errors, misconduct, or degeneration of the purity of the essential transmissions. Foremost concern would be the pure samaya of the lineage holder, so that all transmissions are authentic and complete. Sometimes the lineage holder would have been given permission to alter or adjust aspects of the practices or revelations according to their own wisdom mind, responding to circumstances or need. Sometimes more than one can function as a lineage holder of the same tradition. . . Anyway, that's been my interpretation of the term. I can see that someone with permission and/or the realization and ability to give proper abisheka/wang/Vajrayana empowerment could be interpreted as functioning as a lineage holder, but I don't usually see the term commonly used that broader way. I don't know what the original Tibetan term would be that is sometimes translated as lineage holder—correctly or incorrectly—or if there are multiple terms that are translated this way—correctly or incorrectly. And I don't know if my interpretation (based on what I've gleaned from others' interpretation) is in fact correct. So I am happy to hear from anyone with more knowledge and who is familiar with Tibetan.

I am not sure if that qualifies as an expression of the teachings, as I doubt the teachings recommend doing this. It sounds like he is just referring to a prophecy which probably saw wearing monastic robes as a symbol without keeping the vows as being one type of degeneration. So that would bring it back to self-expression. But out of curiosity Malcolm, would you agree that we are in the time called tagtsam zinpey du?

Having assembled here, you all must listen well. The minds of all these Buddhists of Tibet, for the most part, have never been prepared. So in all of their religious activity thoughts of death and impermanence have not arisen in their minds. If it had arisen, this laziness and indolence would have never existed. They have never understand the characteristics of samsara. If they had understood, they never would have been attached to things. They have never contemplated the difficulty of obtaining leisure and wealth. If they had contemplated, these meaningful activities would have done at once. They have never understood this presentation of their minds. If they had understood it, they would have left non-virtue immediately. They have not seen the benefits and qualities of virtue. If they had seen it, distractions from gathering the two accumulations would have never occurred. They have never approached the profound path even a little. If they had approached it, they could not bear to be separate from meditation and practice. They have never approached the direction of the Mahāyāna bodhicitta. [3/a] If they had approached it, they would work on behalf of others without looking for their own advantage. They have no inclination for ultimate reality. If they had, this jealousy and pride would have never occurred. They have never heard nor contemplated the nine vehicles. If they had done so, they would understand the difference between higher and lower. They have never approached the direction of the view of secret mantra. If they had approach it, they would not accept and reject nirvana and samsara. They have never comprehended the view of reality. If they had, this ordinary grasping behavior would have never occurred. None of them ever desired to obtain complete buddhahood. If they had, they would have given up the activities of this life as unnecessary. Again, none of them have interest in Dharma apart from a few.

For this reason, I’ve also advised my friends, colleagues, and fellow Rinpoches time and again that, when they teach non-Tibetans, they should not encourage the wearing of Tibetan robes or any sort of Buddhist garb. By contrast, seeing a Buddhist practitioner in army uniform, suit and tie, or other normal dress sends the message that Buddhism can be practised by everyone.

The moment a lama imposes some sort of special robes, which is such a deeply ingrained habit, it immediately excludes others and creates a cultish atmosphere. In my view, one of the key reasons the number of Buddhists worldwide is decreasing while other religions like Islam are growing is our habit of introverted exclusivism.

Your tenet is self-deafeating since it negates the function of conventional truth. As Nāgārjuna states:

The Dharma explained by the Buddha properly relies on two truths:
relative truth and ultimate truth.
Someone who does not know the distinction between those two truths
does not know the profound principle of the teaching of the Buddha. 
The ultimate cannot be explained without relying on convention.

This is a pretty typical way to talk about whether the host can get enough people to attend for a teacher to accept an invitation to spend 5 days including travel. You can easily look at the fees on Loch’s website which are reasonable and similar to other dharma teachers.

Malcolm wrote:
I have never heard of such arrangement being required by any Dharma teacher that I know of, up to and including HH Sakya Trizin. HH Dalai Lama is a different case, because, as a former head of state, he travels with an entourage.

In my opinion, apart from travel expenses, no Dharma teacher worth their salt should have any expectation of making a profit from their teachings. Making a profit from teaching Dharma is extremely gauche. Should students wish to make donations out of their devotion to this or that teacher, this is fine. When students understand that they must collaborate together to cover expenses and so forth in order to invite a teacher, this is also fine. But to set fees with the notion that teaching 1-5 students is too few in order to spend 5 days working with them is extremely saddening.

Now of course, if one is teaching inside of an institution like Omega or Kripalu, etc., these companies set a fee structure out of which a teacher will be paid. But the idea that someone decides to teach students based on whether there are "enough" students, especially in the case of teachings derived from the Tibetan and other traditions which have traditionally circulated in small groups, is exceedingly strange.

No proper Saṃkhya or Advaitan would accept an ultimate buddhi/mahat. Buddhi, etc., is relative, and nonsentient.

Purusha, on the other hand, is a passive, disengaged "enjoyer" which "lights up" the tattvas from buddhi down to the element of earth.

When Purusha recognizes buddhi down to the element of earth as not being its own state, it takes the name Jñā, the knower.

The difference between Saṃkhya and Advaita is the Saṃkhya recognizes infinite separate puruśas, whereas Advaita recognizes only one. In both cases, puruśa is eternal.

As far as a meditation instruction? All over the place iirc. I've seen the same instruction in Mahamudra writings I'm certain, heck..I think I even read some Thai Forest people and Zen people with the instruction to observe the observer, know the knower etc. Not saying it's the same thing exactly in those contexts of course...

Astus said:
Mahamudra vipasyana instruction starts with first observing the mind, then thoughts, then external phenomena. As for Zen, it is one of the first questions (huatou) given: Who is it?; or in China especially: Who is reciting the name? (i.e. asking this while chanting Namo Amituo Fo). By the way, Neo-Advaita has this method as well, particularly in Ramana's community, since they actually believe in an ultimate observer.

Well, that's true for pretty much all Tibetan monks and nuns, as well as for ChNN and a whole series of other highly respected teachers, isn't it?

I believe that Westerners have this odd reverse prejudice against Westerners charging money for Dharma. The idea that "it should be free" actually comes from an entirely different culture where a monastic lifestyle was in a much higher regard than it is in the West. Furthermore, it's quite well known that some mahasiddhas charged their students outrageous amounts of money for transmission of a certain teaching cycle, yet others again gave teachings to their students for free.

Sorry, but at minimum, someone who is teaching Dzogchen or Mahāmudra should at least have rudimentary grasp of Tibetan. For example, we have this fellow in Sweden who has claimed he was authorized to teach Dzogchen by TUR, but when such claims are investigated, the basis upon which they are made seems to evaporite like morning mist when the sun rises.

Malcolm wrote:
http://www.gp.org/green_party_moves_tow ... _socialist:

\In a major development, the Green Party took a key step towards declaring itself Eco-socialist. The party’s National Committee voted Sunday night to approve a proposed amendment to the party’s platform entitled “Ecological Economics.” The proposed platform position declares that the Green Party is anti-capitalist and in favor of a decentralized vision socialism.

Queequeg said:
The proposal to amend the 2016 platform will go to the Green Party National Convention for a final vote. The convention will be held in Houston, Texas, August 4-7, a week after the Democratic Party’s National Convention. Almost 78 percent of the National Committee voted in favor of sending the proposal to the convention (76 voted “yes,” 22 voted “no,” with 9 voting to “abstain,” on Proposal 835).

The proposal would have the Greens go on the record, for the first time, that they want to go beyond reforms intended to make capitalism greener, in favor of a democratic and decentralized conception of green socialism. The proposal, “addresses the economic inequalities, social inequalities, and productivism of both capitalism and state socialism and emphasizes grassroots democracy in the workplace. This workplace grassroots democracy has been largely absent from the Green platform, and many believe it is the way forward for a truly ecological economy and a new system...The Green Party seeks to build an alternative economic system based on ecology and decentralization of power, an alternative that rejects both the capitalist system that maintains private ownership over almost all production as well as the state-socialist system that assumes control over industries without democratic, local decision making. We believe the old models of capitalism (private ownership of production) and state socialism (state ownership of production) are not ecologically sound, socially just, or democratic and that both contain built-in structures that advance injustices...Production is best for people and planet when democratically owned and operated by those who do the work and those most affected by production decisions.” http://gp.org/cgi-bin/vote/propdetail?pid=835

Andrea Mérida Cuéllar, the National Co-Chair of Green Party, told IndyBay, “The themes of the left that we saw develop in the early parts of the 20th century are timely again because of the economic, social and environmental upheaval wrought by late-stage capitalism. Even though these themes have been co-opted by the political center, it's clear that the working class in this country is ready for revolution. As the true left discusses reform vs. revolution, the Green Party is now uniquely positioned to finally be the electoral tactic of grassroots movements ... we are now ready to finally become the party of the 99 percent and be worthy of the attention of an anti-oppressive and leftist worker cadre.”

Malcolm wrote:
The late David Orton expresses his own, milder, reservations about Ecosocialism:

Queequeg said:
David Orton on Deep Ecology and Ecosocialism

[This message was posted on the EI-Network yahoogroup on December 21, 2008. To make reading easier, I have divided several long paragraphs, but otherwise the text is unchanged. The original is here.]

Greetings ecosocialists and deep green fellow travelers:

I would like to sign on to the Belém Ecosocialist Declaration (see http://www.ecosocialistnetwork.org/ ), whose spirit I am very sympathetic to, but unfortunately I cannot. There is much I agree with, as for example the critique of the market assumptions of the climate change debate (unfortunately embraced by the Green Party in Canada and Elizabeth May, the current leader). Several people who I respect, because of their work for the natural world and for social justice, including some left biocentrists, have signed on to the Declaration.

I describe myself as someone on the socialist/communist side of the political spectrum. But I am also someone who has embraced the philosophy of deep ecology, first outlined by the Norwegian philosopher Arne Naess. This is the understanding that humans have to come into a fundamentally new ecocentric relationship with the natural world, which rejects a supposed human domination over nature. Nonhuman life and the Earth itself are to be valued independently of their usefulness for human purposes. Also, in order to thrive, human and nonhuman life need “a substantial decrease of the human population”, as the eight-point Deep Ecology Platform outlines.

This does not mean that I and other deep greens “hate socialism” as one of the signers of the declaration has alleged (Joel Kovel, The Enemy of Nature, second edition, p. 302). It does mean, however, that a socialist/communist perspective fundamentally influenced by deep ecology does not share some of the assumptions of this Ecosocialist Declaration.

What are some of these assumptions?

— I think the use of the term “ecosocialism” excludes options and implies that post-industrial societal models of sustainability (based on the socialist/communist tradition) already exist and can be adopted and modified. This is foolish and unfortunate Left arrogance, given the historical record. The environmental legacies of “actually existing” socialist and communist societies are quite negative. (The possible exception here would be Cuba, which has shown leadership, by example, in small plot intensive urban gardens and in developing alternatives to fossil fuel-based rural agriculture, and in the protection of the island’s natural biodiversity.)

It seems to me that “socialism” or “ecosocialism”, as a description of a future deep ecology-inspired and socially just post-capitalist society, is not adequate or inspirational. The type of future ecocentric and socially just social formations is up for discussion. There are no worked out social models that can be simply adopted. Socialism is in many ways an expression of the industrial proletariat, and while its legacy of social justice remains valid, and indeed needed for a future ecocentric society, it is not correct to say that “ecosocialism” will describe the future post-industrial ecocentric society. The features of such a society are a work in progress for all of us to engage with.

I am sympathetic to the view expressed by Saral Sarkar in his book Eco-socialism or Eco-capitalism? that “There is no contradiction between socialism and a truly ecological economy if the former can be conceived of as a non-industrial society…” (p. 5)

— Stan Rowe (1918-2004), a Canadian eco-philosopher, was also a socialist. But he noted in his writings that we are first Earthlings, part of mother Earth, and only in second place human beings. For Stan, both capitalism and socialism as social systems express the basic problem of species selfishness. As he pointed out in his first book of essays Home Place, “Neither philosophical liberalism championing liberty nor philosophical socialism championing equality will save us from ourselves. Human history will end in ecology, or nothing.” (p. 7)

The Belém Declaration is unfortunately people-centered, not Earth-centered. Where is the advocacy for wilderness preservation and other species? Nonhuman species appear to be an afterthought. Social justice for humans is of course necessary, but it must be subordinate to Earth justice for all species. As Rowe has said, although socialism and capitalism share a common “rapacious” anthropocentric view towards Earth exploitation, “socialism has the virtue of extending the circle of care beyond the selfish individual, at least turning our vision outward in the right direction.” (p. 193) But social justice for humans cannot be at the expense of the ecology. “Community” has to include not just humans but other animals, plants and the Earth itself.

— There is no mention of population reduction in the Declaration. This should be a priority for an ecocentric socially just society. It is not only wrong from a human-welfare perspective ­ there are far too many of us ­ but it shows that the habitat needs of other life forms are not considered important.

— The Declaration assumes that it is capitalism, not industrialism, which is the main problem. Left biocentrists see industrial society’s social and technological formation as the main problem, and it can have a capitalist or a socialist face.

— The Declaration assumes “full employment for all” in the new ecosocialist society. This statement conveys that the transition will be painless, and implies that production and consumption will continue. Nothing could be further from the truth. To live sustainably will mean living with much less, along with serious redistribution of wealth to those who are economically marginalized. As has been said, the ecology movement is the first social movement in history to promise a lower material standard of living.

— I feel that generally the Declaration underplays the primary contribution of the environmental and green movements, which have not, in the main, been driven by a socialist consciousness. Socialists have mainly been in the wings, not in the activist vanguard.

— The Declaration says nothing about the need for a new Earth-centered ethics, as part of a green politics, which ends the spiritual separation of most people from the natural world.

— I think that an “Anti-Capitalist Belém Declaration” would be a more appropriate and encompassing name. The endless growth and consumerism of capitalism has no respect for the ecological limits of the Earth or concern for fundamental social justice for all citizens. This could be a banner to rally a wide variety of opposition forces, and it could allow the needed discussion about the nature of a future Earth-friendly and socially just world society. This discussion is pre-empted by using the term “ecosocialist”.

The above should not convey that I am hostile to the Belém Ecosocialist Declaration, because I am not. I regard this Declaration as a positive development and wish to maintain a dialogue with those who sign the Declaration. There is not just one path forward for the Ecocentric Left. As Naess has said, “the front is long.” Perhaps the Declaration will be modified in a more Earth-centered direction at the forthcoming January 2009 meeting in Brazil, a vast country with a rich diversity of plant and animal life, as well as peoples from many ethnic and racial backgrounds.

For the Earth,
David Orton

But for example, Hevajra was never a bodhisattva on the paths and stages, per se, there is no being with a separate continuum "Hevajra". The Hevajra mandala is a method taught by Vajradhara in the Hevajra Tantra to the tenth stage bodhisattva Vajragarbha.

To be honest, the emphasis I catch from this thread is very much of a 'po po if you take the deity to be real' in a way much stronger than you'd ever see for all our casual, but far less skilful, 'reals' like 'myself', 'my family', etc. If it's ok to treat those as conventionally real, surely the same rule applies to the deity in roughly similar measure?


Malcolm wrote:
No, a Yidam is not a sentient being possessing its own continuum. It is a method, that is all. People who do not understand this point, whether Tibetan or Western, do not understand Vajrayāna.

In other words, yidams exist as methods, but not as sentient beings. There is no external Kalacakra existing somewhere whom we petition for blessings when we do a Kalacakra sadhana.

Yidams are Sambogakaya expressions of enlightenment.

Malcolm wrote:
If you mean a yidam is a method taught by the Sambhogakāya, sure, no problem.

The problem here, is that you are not properly distinguishing what is a method and what is not.

For example, when Buddha demonstrated to King Indrabhuti the Guhyasamaja Mandala, that mandala display was being demonstrated as a method to Indrabhuti. It was not being displayed as some external being to whom Indrabhuti was supposed to make offerings and petition for blessings. It was being shown to Indrabhuti to illustrate the pure appearances of the aggregates, sense bases and sense elements of Indrabhuti's own continuum. The latter understood this, and attained Buddhahood on the spot, and in turn, taught the Guhyasamaja Mandala to his kingdom. This can be applied to all instances of the communication of yidam methods in the tantras.

I assume you guys are hip to the fact that HHDL consults an oracle, right?  That entails a man going into a trance and being possessed by some sort of spirit. It's not an enlightened deity, just some sort of spirit-thingy. The spirit gives HHDL cryptic predictions.

Malcolm wrote:
A worldly protector like the Nechung oracle (Dorje Dragden) is a sentient being continuing in samsara. Nechung is not a Yidam.

A transcendent protector like Mahākala is a sentient being who is beyond samsara. When you make offerings to him, you are making offerings to an external entity. Mahākala also has yidam practices.

But when you practice Mahākala as a yidam, in this case, one is not making offerings and so on to an external being, one is using Mahākala as a path.

The creation stage and completion stage, ideally, are merged from the start. However, to directly address your question, the issue is not real/unreal, the issue is impure/pure. The creation stage exists to break attachment to impure appearances, that's all. Nothing more. The completion exists to break attachments to pure appearances, nothing more.

Further, this is the point of starting out from emptiness. The deity arises from emptiness. That means even at the beginning of the practice you must realize the deity is unreal. If you do not realize from the start that the deity is unreal, the process of transforming your vision from impure to pure will never happen.

Malcolm wrote:
When you do the sadhana, you are supposed to be the deity, it is not actually conceived as some external entity to which you are making an appeal.

One is making offerings, prostrations and praises to oneself as the deity.

Geshe Tashi said:
There is a very close connection between mind and body. But there is no way one can replace the other or be transformed into the other. Mind cannot become material and material cannot become mind. Mind is mere experience, nothing more, and experience is not the same as brain function. There is nothing physical about it at all. It is supported by the physical – the eye consciousness is supported by our physical eye and the nerves etc. – but the mind itself is mere clarity and knowing. No more than that. This is a very important point.

Jeff H said:
I think you’re saying that even though mind is completely non-material and matter is completely non-experiential, so that they cannot transform into one another, nevertheless matter originally arose from consciousness.

Assuming I got that specific point wrong, does it negate my general point, that family lineage is derived from a process of physical causality and rebirth refers to the karmic process of mental causality? In other words, birth is the merging of these two different processes, and rebirth refers to the continuity of mental moments being re-associated with different forms.

Malcolm wrote:
It is very simple. From consciousness arises space; from space, air; from air, fire; from fire, water; and from water, earth.

He broke down his cell door to find explosions, gunfire, flames, screams and death. So after 11 years of retreat, with no riot warning whatsoever of an immanent life and death crisis, how did he react? Did he take the Mahamudra approach and say, "It's all mind"? No. He said to himself "The 3 Jewels will not fail me" and took off running. No provisions, no planning, just faith and his feet.

Malcolm wrote:
Ati (the path of self-liberation) is taught as a ninth vehicle to contrast it with the vehicles of cause (paths of renunciation) and result (paths of transformation), not because it is the result of a gradual progression through the nine yānas. However, this is a common misunderstanding even promulgated widely in the Nyingma school.

Two Stages are somehow "lesser."
Basically, the position of ancient Dzogchen masters in India such as Śṛī Siṃha is that the creation stage is unnecessary.
Would it be accurate to say that this position is something of an outlier?

Malcolm wrote:
Śṛī Siṃha was the Dzogchen guru of Padmasambhava, Vairocana and Vimalamitra. So, I think we can say with certainty that this is the normative position of Dzogchen teachings. As I mentioned before, it is not the case that it is impossible to realize Dzogchen through deity practice, as Mañjuśrīmitra notes, however, deity yoga is not necessary on the Dzogchen path, and moreover, as Padmasambhava states in the Khandro Nyinthig, developing a detailed samadhi of a deity is completely unnecessary. It is sufficient to merely think you are the deity, that's it.

And who wrote the preface?

dzogchungpa said:
Now, now guys, there's no need to make an Aunt Sally of poor smcj.

Since ChNN and Tara have come up, I thought you all might enjoy reading this passage from his preface to "Guru Arya Tara and Her Twenty-One Praises": Across cultures and eras in this human experience, we have sensed the existence of a force or fundamental energy that we have come to represent in the form of various female divinities. The ancient people of Shang Shung, for example, recognised this energy by the name Namchi Kungyal, the Grandmother or Ancestor Queen of Heaven. The central female divinity in the pre-Buddhist Bon pantheon, Loving Mother or Chamma, is very similar to Arya Tara in the Buddhist tradition. The American Indians and Australian Aborigines still call this force Mother Earth; the ancient Greeks called it Athena and the ancient Egyptians Great Mother.

The external forms embodying this divine energy are just as diverse as the names and characteristics attributed to it in cultures throughout time. While some populations, such as American Indians and Australian Aborigines, have maintained their ancient traditions throughout processes of change and evolution, others have modified or substituted their ancient religious systems, identifying the essence of this force or energy with a saint or divinity.

One of the most widely known personifications of this maternal and generative energy is found in the Christian tradition, venerated in the form of Mary, considered the Mother of Christ and later called Our Lady or the Madonna, particularly in Latin countries.

The cult of St. Sophia is a good example of the evolution of an ancient religious system. In ancient Greece, sophia, wisdom, was initially one of the chief attributes of the goddess Athena. Later, this quality was personified in a female saint by the same name. The ancient tradition also personified wisdom in female form, for example in the Mahayana, with Yum Chenmo, the Great Mother, the source of al the tathatagas or buddhas.
...
Whether we consider her a goddess, saint, or buddha, and by whatever name we call her, the Great Mother is the compassionate wisdom that nurtures us on the path.

Because the awakening of the sugata does not exist, his magical apparition, while a false appearance, appears to the deluded, similar to an illusion.
And the Buddha states in the PP Sūtra in 8,000 lines, etc:
Son of a good family, the tathāgatas neither come nor go. Son of a good family, for example, an illusory group of elephants, group of horses, group of chariots, or group of soldiers neither come nor go. Son of a good family, the kāya of the tathāgata also neither comes nor goes. 

Son of a good family, for example, a person who has gone to sleep sees one, two, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty tathāgatas or more in his dream; but when he awakes from sleep he does not even see one tathāgata. 

Son of a good family, what do you think? From where do those tathāgatas come? To where do they go? Sadaprarudita, son of a good family, the phenomena in a dream are not established. Dreams are false, they are not real.
If the previous two statements are understood properly, one will understand all the key points of creation and completion stage. In other words, creation stage is the dream, waking is the completion stage.

The Nobel Committee’s recognition of her work effectively debunks popular theories about the Tragedy of the Commons, which hold that private property is the only effective method to prevent finite resources from being ruined or depleted.

I do not think this use of "polytheism" is very precise.  On the other hand, he is trying to help theists (like you) get a handle on the multiplicity of buddhas in Buddhadharma— so it is forgivable, despite being a stretch.

Buddhism is only a polytheism in the sense that it recognizes the existence of the polytheistic pantheon of ancient India.

If we "worship" iṣta-devatas, yidams, as external beings, then our practice becomes Nonbuddhist. Rather than being a insider practice, it becomes an outsider practice. One might object and claim, "In Kriya tantra we are instructed to visualize the deity like a minister petitioning a king, therefore this is a kind of external practice." In reply, while it is true that in Kriya tantra, we generate the deity before us while remaining in our ordinary form, the point is that we are "generating" the deity. This is something we are visualizing, so therefore, even though it may seem externally directed, unlike Vedic practice (where one worships mundane, external sentient beings such as Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva), there is nothing to be found which is not a product of one's own minds.

There is no divine compassion or wisdom apart from the nature of the mind. People who realize that nature of the mind fully are buddhas. People who have partially realized that are called "bodhisattvas." People who aspire to realize that are called "practitioners." People who have no interest in that at all are called "ordinary sentient beings."

No one teaches that the jñānasattva is in fact some relative entity (much less an ultimate entitiy) that can be summoned with a mudra and a mantra from "over there" to "over here."

The summing and absorption of the jñānasattva is an empowerment drama (recapitulated in daily sadhana practice), meant to symbolize the fact that while we have never been separate from the nature of the mind, we have not seen it up till now, and so therefore, the summoning of the jñānasattva is meant to dramatically emphasize this fact and bring it to our attention.

And in lower tantras, the jñānasattva is dismissed "to its natural abode," which is why, among other reasons, that lower tantra is lower. And of course the meaning of this is that in post-equipoise, one readopts one's ordinary form, because now the mandala "drama" in your daily practice is finished. In higher tantra, of course, one is supposed to maintain the dramatic person of the yidam throughout all activities until it no longer feels like a dramatic persona, but instead, one really feels that one is the deity.

There is no deity apart from the nature of one's mind. If someone thinks there is a deity apart from the nature of the mind, they have understood nothing at all about the creation stage, let alone the completion stage.

The Jnanasattva/Samayasattva is a common element of sadhanas for this class in Sarma.  But the sadhanas also include various other methods of development--including instantaneous recollection, and a variety of levels of "building up" and "taking down" the "supporting" and "Supported."

Another interesting difference, in general terms, between Kye Rim in Nyingma and Sarma sadhanas involves whether the Dak Kye and Dun Kye (Self- and front-visualizations) arise simultaneously or whether successive stages of the sadhana focus on one or the other....

I've also been interested in these differences.  Perhaps this isn't the place to discuss the finer points, though...

Cakrasamvara defines different methods of creation based on the kind of birth they are supposed to purify (there are four methods for the four kinds of birth).

Talking about diet, it's also IMO the height of silliness to pretend there is only one "healthy diet" that follows strict rules, any unbiased study of nutrition you can see that this is not so, and that there is likely a range of healthy diets for human beings. But..people gonna' cherry pick to make their case, and 90% of the "studies" and mainstream claims out there about diet aren't worth squat without consulting with someone who has the education and experience to make sense of them - IME.

When you actually do a Yidam meditation the first step is to create a contrived mental image of the deity. That is nothing more than your own mental fabrication, called the Samayasattva. If that were all that there is to it, it could not help you. Your question shows you understand that much.

It is the next step that makes the meditation efficacious. Typically you imagine lights streaming out from you fabricated mental image which invite the "real" Yidam, called the Jhanasattva, to come from wherever they are in the universe and merge with your Samayasattva. The Jhanasattva is NOT a fabrication. Whether you consider it a being, or a radiant expression of enlightenment, or whatever, it is exactly the thing that can fix your mind. And the more faith you have the better it works.

My shorthand is that they are real, with the proviso that their true mode of being is beyond our imagination. It is our limited idea about what "real" means that is being denied, not the validity of the deity.

The conclusion puts processed meats in the same category of cancer risk as tobacco smoking and asbestos.

Polonium-210 and lead-210 accumulate for decades in the lungs of smokers. Sticky tar in the tobacco builds up in the small air passageways in the lungs (bronchioles) and radioactive substances get trapped. Over time, these substances can lead to lung cancer.

The American Empire is more ripe for a counter-revolution than revolution, for right-wing movements than left-wing ones.

My ego desires to finish them as quickly as possible, turning the practice into a project, which is a wrong approach obviously. The ego also gets bored and burned out easily, so how many hours a day is a balanced way, without getting fed up by it?

Athritis in both knees prevent prostrations, but read in another thread that:

"Lama Pema Dorje, in response to older students who find it physically difficult/impossible to do prostrations, has instituted an alternative: For those 50 years old and older, 10 million Vajra Guru mantra in three years"

How long does it take to finish one such mantra?

And what is a so-called "table prostration" for those with a physical disability, and how long does each take?

Planning on doing the Ngondro without retreats. But time itself is not a problem. Just want to avoid a burn-out halfway.

Can I ask a Karma Kagyu Lama in Oslo to get the permission to begin Ngondro even though I will practice Dzogchen within Nyingma? Or is that not an optimal solution? Ask because I can't seem to find any Nyingma center in Norway. Can move to Gomde in Denmark however, later this autumn.

Ahimsa is admirable, and if some how, the world woke up one day and all the humans in it lost their appetite for meat and ceased to slaughter animals, as well as ceased keeping pets and livestock (chickens, mainly) that require animal protein their diets, that would be just fine with me. For example, some of our fine vegetarian friends here definitely have cats and dogs and feed them standard dog and cat food.

The Qila Mubarak fort at Bathinda, India was built by Kanishka the Great.
In the year one, it has been proclaimed unto India, unto the whole realm of the governing class, including Koonadeano (Kaundiny, Kundina) and the city of Ozeno (Ozene, Ujjain) and the city of Zageda (Saketa) and the city of Kozambo (Kausambi) and the city of Palabotro (Pataliputra) and so long unto (i.e. as far as) the city of Ziri-tambo (Sri-Champa).

— Rabatak inscription, Lines 4–6
His territory was administered from two capitals: Purushapura (now Peshawar in northwestern Pakistan) and Mathura, in northern India. He is also credited (along with Raja Dab) for building the massive, ancient Fort at Bathinda (Qila Mubarak), in the modern city of Bathinda, Indian Punjab.

The Kushans also had a summer capital in Bagram (then known as Kapisa), where the "Begram Treasure", comprising works of art from Greece to China, has been found. According to the Rabatak inscription, Kanishka was the son of Vima Kadphises, the grandson of Sadashkana, and the great-grandson of Kujula Kadphises. Kanishka’s era is now generally accepted to have begun in 127 on the basis of Harry Falk’s ground-breaking research.[51][52] Kanishka’s era was used as a calendar reference by the Kushans for about a century, until the decline of the Kushan realm.

Is there something magical about a body that someone killed that makes it taboo, as opposed to a body that apparently died naturally? You apparently are completely unfamiliar with Bhavaviveka's discussion in his Tarkajvala about why it is fine to eat meat pure in three ways. In fine, if you did not see it killed, kill it yourself, or directly order it killed ( for example, placing an order for a side of beef with your local beef CSA), there is no problem. Why? Because you cannot inflict suffering on a piece of dead meat anymore than you can inflict suffering on a wool sweater or leather boots.

Thus, for as long as human beings continue to fish, hunt and raise animals for meat, refusing to buy meat in a market, etc. is simply a waste of a sentient being's life.

Right, we use afflicted desire to get rid of afflicted desire, to become liberated from useless crap like cancer-causing estrogenic alcohol and everything else in the desire realm.

That's the only time to use it.  Otherwise we are proponents of emptiness who are have less renunciation than the proponents of essences that have developed the skill to correctly discriminated the unsatisfactory nature of desire realm objects, achieving form realm absorption

Malcolm wrote:
Objects of the three realms are never the problem. Indeed, the three realms are pure.

And yes, proponents of essences often have more "renunciation" than proponents of emptiness. Why? Since they have no understanding of emptiness, they also have no understanding of purity.

Further, form realms absorptions just are not all that.

For example, if you are a sūtra practitioner, it is ultimately considered ideal to give up sexual pleasure; in Vajrayāna, it is not, in fact, it is the opposite.
My Vajrayana teachers are mostly monks. There are a couple of non-monks, but they are in the minority. And none of them downplay the role of Sutrayana as a foundation for Vajrayana. And none of them have suggested that drinking alcohol is a practice.

Oh, except I did know one Western lama/monk (not a teacher of mine) that was an alcoholic and used the Vajrayana as a rationalization for his drinking. His teachers were not pleased.

Malcolm wrote:
Sūtrayāna is not a foundation for Vajrayāna in terms of the path. Loppon Sonam Tsemo, one of the five founder masters of Sakya, writes (citations excluded) in his General Presentation of Tantra. First with regard to the Sūtra path, he says:
[T]he Pāramitāyāna practitioner makes that basis into a path by giving it up.
He continues a little later:
First, the basis, as explained before, is the five desire objects. Those are the basis itself, but if it is the objects themselves, how are they to be given up? Since most people are totally fettered, how are [they] able to give up [the basis]? [The basis] is not to be given up. 

Now then, if one asks “Won’t there be bondage because of objects?” Those without a method will be bound, i.e., like common beings. If one possesses a method, liberation is assisted by those [objects] themselves. For example, like poison or like fire. Therefore, objects do not intrinsically create bondage. Bondage is created by the deceived concepts depending on those [objects]. For that reason, since one is liberated because of having given up the intrinsic cause of bondage [i.e. deceived concepts,] the objects which [earlier] became the condition of that [bondage] [now] become the condition of liberation.

Vajrayāna is the path devised by the Buddhas for the era (this one) when afflictions are so strong they cannot be abandoned; and therefore, since they are the ultimate causes of suffering, they must be transformed using the special methods of Vajrayāna, because in fact, they cannot be abandoned.

During President Obama’s first six years in office, Washington entered into agreements to sell more than $190 billion in weaponry worldwide -- more, that is, than any U.S. administration since World War II.  In addition, Team Obama has loosened restrictions on arms exports, making it possible to send abroad a whole new range of weapons and weapons components -- including Black Hawk and Huey helicopters and engines for C-17 transport planes -- with far less scrutiny than was previously required.

If you read his texts, you will see that in general he taught to avoid eating meat, but he saved his most cutting remarks for monastics.

"the earth, in its natural uncultivated state... was the common property of the human race"; the concept of private ownership arose as a necessary result of the development of agriculture, since it was impossible to distinguish the possession of improvements to the land from the possession of the land itself. Thus, Paine viewed private property as necessary while at the same time asserting that the basic needs of all humanity must be provided for by those with property, who have originally taken it from the general public. This in some sense is their "payment" to non-property holders for the right to hold private property.

Pish posh Malcolm; the point has been made, such as it is.

Just as the buddhadharma has many distinct, differing views, yet all are Buddhism, so if one wants to parse the variety of Marxist spinoffs as different, fine - but they are all Communism.

Malcolm wrote:
There is nothing the slightest bit Marxist about the Chinese Government. I have been there. I know. They are more Confucian now than they ever were Marxist.

Actually it depends on different terma cycles, whether his birth was in monkey month or the sheep month.  The difference in calendar only signifies when those days would correspond to the modern solar calendar, not when the birth is thought to have occurred.

Can you give an example of a treasure biography of Guru Rinpoche that gives his birth month as the sheep month?

Buddhism has been a proselytising religion from the beginning. That is the point of the Nikaya story about the Brahma Sahampati beseeching the Buddha to 'teach for the benefit of many, for the sake of those with a little dust in their eyes'. Recall that prior to this intervention, the Buddha was inclined not to teach, but afterwards, decided to go forth and teach, which he did, and which is the reason that Buddhism spread throughout the ancient East and remains the force for good that it is today.


Malcolm wrote:
The Buddha did not stand on a street corner broadcasting his message like a radio, with no consideration of who was listening. Instead, Buddhadharma has spread on the basis of Dharma teachers teaching those who are interested that which they were interested to hear, and that which they were able to employ in their lives.

Nor did the Buddha and his disciples stand on a street corner handing out handbills, with hopes that people would show up at his teachings.

Proselytizing, the attempt to convert someone to one's own religion or set of beliefs, is the very opposite of the Buddha's project. Evangelism, in this instance the zealous advocacy of a cause or set of views, is also the very opposite of the Buddha's project.

Buddhadharma has spread in the world due to the merit of sentient beings, and when that merit is finally exhausted, the Dharma will vanish at the same time.

From Rivkin's article at the blog.  Like to hear all the DW sages specifically respond to the content of this quote and 2) read and respond to the articles on communism in 2016 Vietnam, N. Korea, Cuba etc.

This is so I may learn from your greater wisdom.
Despite our best efforts and intentions, America has not been as successful at eradicating communism as President Eisenhower had hoped. In the 21st Century, more people live under communism than at any point in history. While most of Eastern Europe is free of communism, China, Vietnam, Laos, Cuba, and North Korea still have communist regimes that continue to rob a combined 1.5 billion people of their human rights and liberties. Beyond the borders of communism, the populations of Russia, Belarus, and Crimea continue to suffer under collectivist and statist regimes that resemble communism as nearly as makes no difference.
One more point about my frequent lack of engagement with those wiser heads here, I post very often not to solicit responses or discuss, but just to give lurkers something to ponder.

So in that light, maybe its better to not use the word "evangelism" and rather talk about public, interactive practice out in the Buddha's wheat field.

Malcolm wrote:
There are some Buddhist groups that engage (mistakenly) in evangelism. But the Dzogchen point of view is broader, more subtle, and far, far more effective at providing the causes of liberation to sentient beings.

There is absolutely no need to evangelize the Dharma. A precious human birth is something that arises from past merit accumulation. If you have the merit to meet Buddhadharma, it is inevitable that you will. If you don't, you won't. The Nicherin evangelical trip always struck me as odd.

Queequeg said:
In some ways it strikes me as odd, too, but nobody is really interested in discussing its details so, putting it aside.

I raised the argument above that there is something fatalistic in this view of karmic destiny. Kind of Calvinist.
Not at all -- if one should waste this opportunity, there is no knowing when one will meet it again. The Calvinist point of view, by contrast, was that there is an elect who are preordained for salvation.
It also does not in any way undermine evangelizing activities, because it can equally be said that the chance encounter with the Buddhist preacher on the corner was the particular manner in which that person's encounter with Buddhadharma was conditioned to happen in this life.

Malcolm wrote:
Sure it does. What it means is that there is no point to evangelical activities in Buddhadharma because people will always meet the Dharma in this world for as long as there are fortunate people and the Dharma has not disappeared. And even if the Dharma has disappeared, since suchness is always present and waiting to be discovered, even if there are no buddhas, there is always the possibility of awakening.

I agree, particulary with the second paragraph, though the third paragraph seems a little too timid. Not that I know what a good stronger approach would be. Just quietly practicing doesn't seem particularly effective, especially in the West where people will have no idea that a person is exemplifying Buddhist ideals. The role model might need a little more marketing around it.
