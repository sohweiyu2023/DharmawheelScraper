The Buddha said, “The misfortune of being tied to wife, child, treasures and estate is greater than being in prison fettered and in chains. In prison there are pardons given. The feelings for wife and child, though as dangerous as a tiger's mouth, one willingly leaps into it. That fault is without pardon.”

The main point is whether you actually agree with the goals that a military force has in mind. From a Buddhist POV, if you do, you share in all the negative actions of the whole army. This is very well detailed in the karma chapter in the Abhidharmakoshabhasyam.

Since I don't have the Abhidharmakoshabhasyam handy at the moment, could you cite that? What is the implication of this? I think I've heard of this group-karma thing, and I always wondered about what the exact requirements were. What about tax-payers? What about people who are in the military and disagree? I could see how if you had a mob of people running around that killed someone, sure, that'd be easy to figure out.

If some one sees the goal of a military as just keeping the peace and protecting people (naive, sure) what then?


Malcolm wrote:
The idea is that if you are in a military force and you approve of its goals i.e. killing people, you share in all of the karma of all acts of killing multiplied by the number of people in that army. So if you are in a million man army, and you approve of the goals of that army, every time one person is killed by that army, the karma for you is multiplied by a million, thus it becomes very heavy karma indeed.

Taxpayers are generally forced to pay taxes under duress or threat. However, if you are cheerfully sending in your taxes the govt. and support its goals in the army it supports, then also you share that karma X however many people are supporting that army whether civilian or not.

It is hard to be a conscientious objector in the military, but yes, I suppose you could belong to an army and yet be completely opposed to its overall mission.

I'm mildly taken aback at this - if you take the eight vows according to the Tibetan ritual an mean it then you are raising bodhicitta, accumulating merit, etc (the etc are the advantages listed in mt post on this minus the result of being reborn in the Pure Lands for the sake of argumentation) - it can be argued that the ritual is mildly esoteric on the basis of the dharani of pure morality recitation and people are instructed to view themselves taking the vows in the presence of all the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and can view themselves as taking the vows from them (making the force of the vows stronger).  You are also supposed to do purification practice, usually the 35 Buddhas Recitation.

The power of this sincere practice has been describe as a cause of rebirth in higher realms or the pure lands (rebirth in higher or lower realms isn't that difficult as Shakyamuni outlined numerous methods and results of practices).  Shakyamni said that the result of doing the uposatha practice is virtuous and would result in higher rebirth and better circumstances including rebirth the deva realms.  The teachings concerning nyung nay practice clearly describe the result as a fast track to the pure lands (although not a definite track) and a major component of the nyung nay practice is holding the eight vows, and doing 35 Buddha purification (and it's other major component is praise to Avalokiteshvara).

Although I find your arguments plausible, nevertheless the Bon maintains a different position as to the origin of the rGyud bzhi.

Malcolm wrote:
yes.


orgyen jigmed said:
For example, in contrast to your argument in favour that the rGyud bzhi being a translation of an Indian work,

Malcolm wrote:
I never said that. The rgyud bzhi is definitely not a translation of an India work. It is a native Tibetan composition. More importantly, the text itself never pretends to be a translation. Unlike the rgyud chung, the rgyud bshi lacks a translator's colophon in every single edition, of which we have twelve. Not only does it lack a translator's colphon, it lacks a treasure colophon as well. The rgyud chung i.e. the minor tantra, the Amritahridayaguhyaupadesha tantra on the other hand claims to have been written by Candrānanda (the author the major commentary of the Aṣṭanga hridaya samhita) and having been passed in a single lineage from one emanational person to another, found its way into the hands of Yuthog. This text is absolutely the basis for the man ngag rgyud and phyi ma rgyud and their 'bum bzhi corollaries.


orgyen jigmed said:
the Bonpo Ga-rgya Khyung-sprul 'Jigs-med namkha'i rdorje (1897-1957) claims that the rGyud bzhi was written in the Zhang Zhung language.  Whatever your opionion may be to his claim, what is known for certain is that medical texts believed to be of Zhang-zhung origin  have been found among the Dunhuang manuscripts (PT 127), which asserts that it was based on the Zhang-Zhung medical tradition (Karmay, 2009).

Malcolm wrote:
These texts that mention Zhang Zhung do not mention the 'bum gzhi.

To reach an understanding how the Bon could have come to such a conclusion, one must consult with the Zhiji...

gzi gjid is quite late. And I have consulted it. It's discussion of medicine is very limited. It revealed after the rgyud bzhi was composed.

orgyen jigmed said:
What I do find interesting according to this account, is not only that the doctrine of Tonpa Shenrab was spread by "six-great translators" to adjacent countries which included: Zhang-Zhung, Sum-pa (East of Zhang-Zhung), Phrom (Mongolia) China, Kashmir, India and finally Tibet, but that these teachings have also spread to India by Lha-bdags sNgags-grol ; pressumably these included medical knowledge, considering that all cultures have shared ideas of what makes people sick, what makes well and how people can maintain good health through time, and therefore may have also included the Variegated Collections of Therapies (dPyad 'bum Khra bo) and the White and Black Collection of Medicines (sMan 'bum dkar nag), although I must concur that I do not have any evidence in favour or against to further support these claims.

Malcolm wrote:
Ayruveda comes from the Atharva Veda. Not from Tazig. Caraka Samhita is a late commentary  compiled between 200 BCE -- 200 CE, with large and signification portions reconstructed at a later date. The text around which Caraka was compile is a text called Agnivesha tantra.

But on the other hand, if this hypothesis is correct, it is not so difficult to understand how traditional medical knowledge and practices could have also entered India from the North (something the proud Indians would not so easily submit), as well as other neighbouring countries.

This migration could have been part of pastoral adaptation in search of subsistence in different ecological environments.

Thus, one must take into consideration this dynamic circular process instead of a static one way process.

There is no doubt that knowledge spread widely in the Ancient world along trades routes that had been well established for centuries. Who knows what interesting texts were in the library at Alexandria?

Another divergance in opinion held by the Bon is that g.Yu-thog Yon-tan mgon-po is considered to be not other then the Bonpo gter ston Khu-tsha Zla-'od (Karmay, 2009). However, as I am neither a scholar nor can I claim any competence in Tibetan Medicine and its history I must remain open to more expert views.

Malcolm wrote:
[/quote]

I find this quite unlikely simply due to the fact that most of the major elements of Yuthog's life and his immediate students are well attested. For example, in the mid-12th century, Chomden Rigpa'i raltri's commentary on the Aṣṭanga hridaya samhita criticized the rgyud bzhi tradition directly, see my blog entry here:

http://www.bhaisajya.net/2008_09_01_archive.html

There are two articles I wrote that bear on our discussion. I did make one mistake in this article that was corrected by Dan Martin. Chebu Trishe is mentioned in the mdo 'dus. This is from the tenth century perhaps. But it is deprecated in Bon because it describes Shenrab as having a human mother and father, etc. It is not as grand as Ziji or Zermig.

Even more importantly, if Yuthog was also known as Khu-tsha Zla-'od, his grandfather was still a direct disciple of Rinchen Zangpo and heard the Aṣṭanga hridaya samhita from that translator. There is no possible way that the explanatory tantra and the 'bum khra bo are not based on Aṣṭanga hridaya samhita.

Basically, Bon claims to origins of brgyud bzhi simply do not stand up to text critical analysis. This is not personal, and I have no axe to grind. Bonpo physicians are just as good as Buddhist ones. We use the same basic text. But the text does not originate in Bon. Even so, if it did, it would still depend on the Aṣṭanga hridaya samhita for many things.

Further, I could give you a hundred words in the brgyud bzhi/'bum bzhi that are direct derivatives from Sanskrit  i.e. tigta (tikta which means bitter in fact in Sanskrit i.e. swertia chirata), shing kun (a Tibetan mispronunciation of hing gu, i.e. asafeotida), Manupatra/puṣkarmūla i.e. inula racemosa etc. I really can go and on and and on. There are very few words in this text from Zhang Zhung language -- hong len (Lagotis brevituba, which may actually be a Chinese word), tre sam, etc., these are just a very few of the few words left over from Shang Shung language in this the rgyud bzhi/'bum bzhi.

Moreover, for example, the sngo 'bum chapter of the explanatory tantra definitely depends on two texts described in my blog article here:

http://www.bhaisajya.net/2009_01_01_archive.html

For the most part, the whole of the Tibetan textual tradition about herbs depends on the two texts described in that article. There are no corresponding Bon sngo 'bums.

Anyway, this is my conclusion and in my opinion, the Bonpos do not have good support for their counter arguments.

But, if one is not sure, then being mindful is just regular Sutra practice (still useful), so surely there must be something one can mindful of in daily life-- until one has reached a state of certainty--which is still Dzogchen practice?
Hope that is clear enough.

[quote="tamdrin"]


I just read it. It is a very nice short text. It has many citations from many different sutras, especially the Lanka, proving that Cig car is a superior method to the gradual path. I translate a bit of it below. It uses many sūtras translated from Chinese which raises the interesting possibility that Indian Dzogchen masters were sympathetic to Chan in general.

This is one of the nicest citatations, taken from the Arya-candragarbha-prajñāpāramitā-mahāyāna-sūtra:

Just as a spark
cannot dry an ocean,
likewise, relative truth
cannot dry one's afflictions,
what need to mention those of others?

Also it has a nice take on practicing the six paramitas, etc.

If it is said by someone 'It is necessary to practice the six perfections and so on', the explanation for that in the Vajrasamadhi sūtra is:
"The six perfections are all included in the emptiness of the mind" and in the Brahmaviśeṣacintipariprīcchā sūtra: "No thought is generosity. Non-abiding is discipline. Total non-differentiation is patience. Not accepting or rejecting is diligence. Lack of desire is samadhi. Not serving is prajñā. The Lankāvatara sūtra states: "For as long as the mind is engaged, for that long one is a worldly materialist". Since mere generosity and so on exist for thirtikas, if one follows signs, there is the fault of not leaving samsara. 

Someone claims "There is no greater merit than reciting and copying [sūtras]. The explanation for that in the Samadhirāja sūtra is "If someone, very faithful to awakening and has regret towards the conditioned, should take seven steps in direction of retreat, the merit is supreme over that [of reciting and copying texts]." The Mahāuṣnịṣa sūtra states: "Meditating on stainless prajñā for a single day or night has infinitely more merit than reading and reciting the sūtra division of dharma for as many eons as there are atoms." If it is asked why,it is said "In order to be far from birth and death" but this is not said of reciting and copying the sūtras.

Someone claims "There is no method of benefitting sentient beings in non-conceptual meditation." The explanation for that is in the Prajñāpāramitā sūtra: "Subuhuti,here, dwelling in the three samadhis of a bodhisasattva mahasattva and a sentient being engaging conceptuality, those are placed in emptiness." A sentient being engage in signs joined to signs. A sentient being who aspires for a result is joined to the aspiration. Subhuti, in the same way a bodhisattva mahasattva is engaged in perfect wisdom and dwells in three samadhis, and totally ripens sentient beings." Therefore, the benefit of sentient being is performed by non-conceptuality. 

Demonstrating the dharma through signs is the work of māra and is a companion of sin. The Buddhakośa sūtra states "One who does not understand the dharma who demonstrates it to others causes sentient beings to be born in hell." If it is asked why it is because they are demonstrating the dharma incorrectly. "Explaining dharma incorrectly" means "demonstrating through things and signs", therefore, sentient beings are benefitted without being perceived.

Some one claims "There is no non-conceptual confession of sins". The explanation for that is in the Bhricaphulu sūtra: If one wishes to purify through confession, sit straight, gaze properly, and look at reality correctly [yang dag la yang dag lta], having seen reality, one is liberated. This is the supreme purification through confession."  Therefore if one sits with an unmoving mind it is said to be the supreme purification through confession."

I also do not believe that you have to practice the sex in order to become enlightened as some have said here.

Malcolm wrote:
There are many people who are students of the Dalai Lama who are not Vajrayāna practitioners. That person is a Zen practitioner.

What tamdrin was saying is that there is a Vajrayāna tradition i.e. that our Buddha, in a past life, took a goddess named Tilottama has his partner and achieved awakening together with her through advanced completion stage practices.

You have to understand the theory. The theory is basically that ordinary, sūtrayāna meditation does not still the wind in the body sufficiently so that one can experience the most subtle level of mind which is necessary to recognize emptiness at the most subtle level. One way of accessing a more subtle mind is through the experience of bliss with a partner. The point is not the bliss itself, the point is to go beyond the bliss in a very direct, visceral way, using bliss to go beyond bliss into the union of great bliss and emptiness. This is what deities in yabyum mean i.e. using sensation of bliss to realize emptiness.

When ever you take a major anuttara yogatantra empowerment, you are symbolically introduced to this practice in the higher three empowerments. Also this kind of empowerment is very much connected with the stages of gestation of human beings and that dependent origination. So it is really not about sex per se. Even the use of sexuality in these practices has more to do with reversing dependent origination of one's conception, gestation in the womb, and so on, than anything else.

Whether or not one uses a partner depends a) whether there is a qualified partner (you cannot have just any partner) b) whether one is a lay person or not (this is an area of controversy where some, for example in the Gelug school, claim is it ok for a monk to have a partner solely for this kind of practice, there are differing opinions about this) c) and you ideally should be between 16 and 26 years old for this kind of practice anyway. I have heard it said by Lamas -- when we are this age, no one will teach us this sort of practice and by the time we learn, we are too old to practice it.

There is also another path in Vajrayana, very wide-spread in the Sakya and Gelug school, in the Vajrayogini tradition i.e. the path for those "who do not enjoy desire", equally effective for realizing mahāmudra based solely on meditation and pranāyama (breathing) exercises.

Then there is Kagyu style mahāmudra -- no need for consort practice in general, though it is present in the six yogas of Naropa.

Then there is Dzogchen. In Mahāmudra and Dzogchen use of partners is not considered essential on any level. It is mainly in Sakya and Gelug that use of partners is considered essential. Tsongkhapa himself wrote that without using a partner, complete liberation was impossible.

The great Nyingmapa master, Longchenpa, on the other hand, wrote that such practices were for people who had a lot of lust who needed something to until they got over it and that that such practices where just a diversion in reality -- not invalid, just a diversion and a possible distraction to the direct path of Dzogchen.

According to the Sūrya Siddhānta, a key Indian astronomical treatise, kaliyuga started on February 18th, 3102 BCE. This would mean nobody's practice of renunciation in Shakyamuni's Sangha has bore fruit at any point? Why did the Buddha teach it if it would not bear fruit?

Some weeks ago you stated the following at another thread:
From the point of the view of the spirit of the thing, perhaps -- but standards must be maintained. There are many people who are capable of upholding their vows -- so it is not impossible. Since there are such people, I think it is important their discipline be recognized and honored -- and it is not honored by allowing just anyone to call themselves or demand they themselves be treated as a fully ordained person just because they wish to have that status. People you are talking about won't care one way or another what they are called. But Bhikshus are the ambassadors of Shakyamuni Buddha. When his monastic sangha disappears, his dharma will be on the verge of collapsing.
Is there not a contradiction between what you said now and then?

If we do away with monasticism, will not the dharma then be on the verge of collapse? If it already is on the verge of collapse, then shouldn't strengthening the monastic institutions be encouraged?

But slowly we get some standards in Tibet which results in the TTM we know today.

Malcolm wrote:
The rgyud bzhi contains no Bon medical texts. The Bon canon is very poor in specific medical texts, in reality. In reality the Bon canon has only two medical texts. The 'bum bzhi and a modern synthetic (i.e. also using Buddhist sources) commentay by the famed Bonpo doctor and astrologer, Khyung trul Jigme Namkhai Dorje (1897-1956).

By contrast, the Buddhist Tengyur has five volumes of medical texts.

However, there are some uniquely Bon medical texts that do not seem to have survived to the present day. There is a famous commentary on poisons attributed to dbyad bu khri shes mentioned by De'u Mar Geshe Tenzin Phunstog. There are perhaps Bon medical termas not included in the present Bon canon. I don't know. There are doubtless some tantras in the Bon canon which preserve medical knowledge. But the Bonpoa do not have an extensive collection of medical texts in their canon. This is easy to discover. Just read the catalogue.

Khyung trul's commentary  writings seem to be the source of the sustained contention that 'bum bzhi was translated from Zhang Zhung language. However, there are many more loan words from Sanskrit in the rgyud bzhi than from Zhang Zhung language in fact. Couple this with the fact that Tibetans typlically misidentify words taken from any foreign language other than Sanskrit as "Zhang Zhung" these days and you can see there is a whole lot of confusion among Tibetans about the origins of this text.



But the fact is that Bon in general has fairly paltry resources on medicine apart from 'bum bzhi.

Going by the conclusions of Dr. Tsering Thakchoe Drungtso, in his book 'Tibetan Medicine: The healing science of Tibet (2008) it seems thats he does not share your entire opinion.
Code: Select all
Although he is in agreement that it is almost impossible to credit the orignin of Tibetan Medicine to any one particular source, he notes that while the authorship of the present version of rGyud-bZhi remains highly contraversial, he nevertheless  brings scriptural evidence to support his claims, that the Last Tantra of the present version of the rGyud-bZhi  are derived from the Bon Zhang Zhung texts, such as the sMan-'Bum-dKar-Po, sMan-'Bum-Nag-Po and sMan-'Bum-Khra Bo (p.32).

Malcolm wrote:
He is just giving into a sort of Tibetan nationalism. It is not supported by textual analysis. I have these texts. The 'bum dkar po corresponds with the phyi ma rgyud. The phyi ma rgyud contains the so called las lnga. This presentation of the las lnga (pañcakarma) closely follows the presentation of pañcakarma in the Aṣṭangahridaya Samhita. Embryology and signs of death in both the bshad rgyud and the 'bum khra bo closely follows the Sarira sthana of the Aṣṭangahridaya Samhita. The same goes for chapters of the progress of disease, diet, lifestyle, etc. The similes of the body are straight out of the Yellow Emperor's classic adapted to Tibetan architecture.

All I can say is that  Dr. Tsering Thakchoe Drungtso is either very poorly read in Ayurvedic texts in Tibetan translation or he is suffering of nationalistic bias.

You should examine the research of Yanga Tsarong, the world's leading expert on this subject, who is the dean of students at Lhasa Mentsee Khang. When he was at Harvard, he did line by line comparisons with the rgyud bzhi, 'bum bzhi and the Aṣṭangahridaya Samhita as well as extensive research into the history of Ancient medicine in general. He concluded a) rgyud bzhi was composed either by Yuthog Sarma or a circle of his close disciples. b) 'bum bzhi is quite late comparatively and derivative of rgyud bzhi. He has no axe to grind, he is not anti-bonpo. c) rgyud bzhi depends heavily on Aṣṭangahridaya Samhita and other Indian, Chinese and Galenic sources. c) the text itself in its present form cannot be older than circa 1200 CE. +- 30 years.

The sman dbyad zla ba rgyal po is older, certainly dating to the tenth century if not earlier. Also Dr Ronit Yoeli-Tlalim has shown that the outline of urinalysis in this latter text (which is the source for urinalysis in the rgyud bzhi/'bum bzhi) is matched very closely by the section on urinalysis in the Canon of Medicine by Ibn Sina (980-1037).

I myself, as a translator of these texts, frequently resort to the Tibetan recension of the Aṣṭangahridaya Samhita and so on to resolve issues. Not only this, but there are direct citations of Caraka embedded with both the brgyud bzhi and the 'bum bzhi, also in the called man ngag rgyud or 'bum nag po.  I could go on and on but I don't want to bore you.

From this we can conclude that not all medical knowledge originates from Indian sources, but that  some  must have been inherited from the old shamanic Bon.

Malcolm wrote:
Some, but not nearly as much as many people imagine. I agree that not all medicine comes from Indian sources in the brgyud bzhi. Much of the knowledge in the brgyud bzhi, while not Bon in particular, is Tibetan. Some of it is from Greek medicine. For example, the method of finding hairline fractures in the skull comes straight from Hippocrates. Pulse diagnoses ultimately derives from Chinese medicine. Moxa is probably of Tibetan Origin. Bloddletting comes from Ayurveda. The surgical implements chapter in the bshad rgyud/'bum khra bo is borrowed directly from Sushruta down to the name of the implements, their shapes and uses.


orgyen jigmed said:
While summarizing the origin and historical development of Tibetan Medicine, Drungtso (2008) argues: "it can be concluded that the Tibetan Medical system has an indigenous origin and, over time, shared knowledge with many neighbouring cultures and kingdoms, which culminated in the compilations of sMan-'Bum-dkar-Nag-Khra-gSum and the two versions of rGyud-bZhi by Yuthok Yonten Gonpo the Elder and Younger, which reflected medical knowledge of the first millennium BCE, the 8th and 12th centuries of the modern era" (p.32).

Malcolm wrote:
Yuthog Nyingma is a fiction. The sole evidence we have for his existence is the 17th century bio composed by Darmo Menrampa (5th Dalai Lama's personal physician). HIs existence was rejected by doctors at Palpung for this very reason. You can talk about this with Professor Thubten Phuntsog (who himself is an advocate of the 'bum bzhi theory).

Prior to this text, there is not a single mention of an elder Yuthog in any historical document connected with Tibetan medicine. I have done a great deal of primary text research in this area. More importantly, Yuthog's grandfather was a direct disciple of Rinchen Zangpo. As I said, the brgyud bzhi was composed based on the rgyud chung and augmented with theory primarily drawn from the Aṣṭangahridaya Samhita. The 'bum gzhi is a derivative text revealed as Bon terma certainly no earlier than the mid 12th century.

In all likelyhood, the 'Bum bzhi is later than the rgyud bzhi and derives from it.

This area is something in which I am somewhat expert, having compared these texts with Tibetan translation of the Aṣṭanga hridaya samhita, one of the main Ayurvedic treatises. Both the rgyud bzhi and the 'bum bzhi depend on this text as an antecedent, especially most of the explanatory tantra (bshad rgyud) or the bon version, the multicolored volume ('bum khra bo)  -- there are many, many passages derived directly from the Aṣṭanga hridaya samhita in both texts.

There is another text called "the minor tantra" (rgyud chung) which is preserved in the cha lag bco brgyad which is a miscellany of texts composed by Yuthog Sarma and others (the evidence of for a Yuthog Nyingma is lacking and he probably was invented by Darmo Menrampa in the 17the century) in the late 12th, early 13th century. The the minor tantra, in my opinion, is the source of both the man ngag rgyud (clinical medicine) and the phyi ma rgyud (therapeutics) as well as the black volume and the white volume ('bum nag po, 'bum dkar po).

The "minor tantra" was received by Yuthog Sarma. He expanded it with his main disciple, Yeshe Zung into the present Four Tantras we have today by composing the root tantra and abstracting major portions of the sutra sthana and sarira sthana out of the Aṣṭanga hridaya samhita. Moreover, whole chapters of the Uttara sthana are reproduced word for word in the Man ngag rgyud/'bum nag.

Moreover, there is a detailed tantric system called the Yuthog Nyingthig which is associated with this tradition that share significant intertextuality with the four tantras themselves -- in particular the conduct of the doctor -- which itself is abstracted in large measure from the Aṣṭanga hridaya samhita. There is to my knowledge (I could be wrong) no such corresponding tantric system associated with the 'Bum bzhi in Bon which is practiced only by Bon doctors.

Now then, do medical traditions from Bon and Shang Shung exist in the four tantras? The answer is yes. The system of compresses and medicinal baths and so on, as well as many remedies, some names of herbs, and so on derive from Shang Shung and Bon.

But to claim that the rgyud bzhi really is a text converted from a Bon original means the original Bon author copied and abstracted large sections of a Buddhist Ayurvedic text, Aṣṭanga hridaya samhita that was only translated into Tibetan in the 980's by Rinchen Zangpo.

Personally, in this instance I think it is clear that 'bum bzhi depends on the rgyud bzhi, and that the rgyud bzhi is the earlier text.

In any event, the main point is that both text teach an identical system of medicine i.e. the system of Tibetan Medicine.

It's true that many European cities are ringed by impoverished suburbs dominated by immigrants from their former colonies by virtue of their own policies:  guest worker programs and the distribution public assistance on one hand, and refusal of full political and social enfranchisement on the other.  It's worthwhile to compare the experience of Sweden, where immigrants are taught the language and better encouraged into the mainstream, to that of France of the Netherlands, where immigrants are effectively ghettoized and have little else to do than practice "la perruque" if employed at all.  Sweden's system isn't perfect, but it seems to produce better results.

Malcolm wrote:

Jikan said:
The question of Enlightenment is a debatable one historically.  The debate on it is irrelevant to the thread, so I'll just say that if there is something analogous to an enlightenment in the Islamic world, it's happening right now, starting in Tunisia.

Even if you bracket all that, I think my broader point stands:  it's counterproductive to use us-against-them rhetoric to build yourself up as a popular One of Us.  It's analogous to the teabagger treatment of Latinos in the U.S., who are also said to overrun our cities and dilute our culture like a contagion, all the while relying on familial bonds and medieval superstitions such as saint worship.  I find that nonsense objectionable too, as it incites violence (literal and otherwise) against the Other.

Malcolm wrote:
Ole is a dumb guy. But his concerns, while phrased in right wing terms that I do not particularly admire show that there is an underlying problem with the assimilation of Muslims in Europe. Of course we can point to colonial policies in various colonies, etc., but ghettos form for two reasons, one because ghettoed communities themselves tend to practice cultural exclusion (Muslims and Jews are perfect examples of this i.e. Hallal, Kosher, refusing to eat with gentiles) and are also ghettoized because they are "others". The fact that Christians broke this trend was key to the success of Christianity among Greek slaves in the Roman empire.

Also, I stand by the historical record that shows that Muslims barely tolerated Buddhists in places they conquered and often slaughtered us wholesale and went to great lengths to erase all evidence of Buddhism in Central Asia.

I am pretty sure that the "revolution" in Mulsim countries now will wind up with the creation of Islamocracies like Iran. I don't see these revolutions remaining progressive for very long. The world is in for one long drawn out conflict between the Muslim world and everyone else. You may not like it, you may not believe it, but it is going to happen.

Sometimes, when you are an advanced practitioner, there are kinds of conduct you must keep secret until you have mastered stability in your practice. For example, eating meat, drinking wine, etc. these things were very shocking in ancient Buddhist India.

If you don't like the idea of sex as practice and want to practice Vajrayana your best bet is with the Gelukpa sect as they, in general, follow the example of Je Tsongkhapa who maintained pure monastic vows, thus he didn't use a consort, and consequently he was said to have achieved enlightenment in the bardo instead of in this life.  Although there are always exeptions, in Gelukpa too.. Stuff happens in secret, people aren't perfect.  And this type of consort practice that is found in vajrayana is not a teacher taking advantage of a student, or at least it shouldn't be- I agree with you there!  What pissess me off is the monks who pretend on the outside that they are monks- but in secret they take women.. This is pretty common in Tibetan Buddhism-unfortunately.  Maybe you should question yourself as to why you feel such an aversion to people using sex on the path if it is a consensual relationship?
Thank you so much for this post. Even my teacher said that they do not practice in the way I feared and that they keep monastic vows. I thought it was all the same.

Thank you all for your posts since I last posted, as it cleared up many misconceptions.

I do not have weird protestant morality. Just because I don't believe that teachers should be sleeping with their disciples or that sex should be used to reach high states of meditation, does not make me a weird protestant. You don't need the use of sex to reach enlightenment, and I also agree with Dechen, that most flock to tantric teachings for the wrong reason, and that too is materialism. Sometimes, they may wind up with teachers who do take advantage of them, but maybe that is what they wanted too. The book, Sex and the Spiritual Teacher, is a good read.

However, in new tantra system of Sakya, Kagyu, Gelug and Jonang, Samantabhadra is never represented with form since he is the mind of all the Buddhas. Only Vajradhara has a representation since he represents the principle of the manifestation of the dharmakāya as a teacher.

In Dzogchen however, the dharmakāya is represented as a Buddha free from ornaments, where as the sambhogakāya is represented as possessing ornaments.

In the system of the nine kāyas Vajradhara represents the dharmakāya sambhogakāya, whereas Samanabhadra is the dharmkāya dharmakāya.

Even that short attempt to tune in was interupted - my dad woke up from his nap and was neing sick and so I had to hop downstairs for ten minutes...  Oh well, it seems there are teachings given a couple of times a year - maybe next time, I will have better luck, not have a sick father and remember that tip on how to fix the video!

At what point one does this thun practice?

Malcolm wrote:
Whenever you have more time. No time, White A; more time, short thun, even more time, medium thun, etc. There is no specific preliminary practice to do in Dzogchen Community. Perhaps one should learn how to sing song of the vajra properly. A sample practice might run -- purification mantra of five elements; guru yoga of white A and Song of the vajra, dedication. This is a pure Atiyoga practice. But Rinpoche has remarked there is no such a thing as "pure" Atiyoga. Why? Because practitioners have needs since we have dualistic vision. Therefore, we need things like Mandarava practice for long life, Garuda for cancer, etc. But the one thing that is indispensable is Guru Yoga of White A.

If you like gradual style, than I encourage you to study for the base level exam of Santi Mahāsangha. Obtain the book Precious Vase.

Historically, Chinese Esoteric Buddhism, or the Hanmi Mystery School, was thought to be lost when Emperor Tang Wuzong banned the teaching. Huiguo, the last known disciple of Amoghavajra, had left China and went with Kukai to Japan to establish the Japanese Esoteric school of Buddhism, later known as the Shingon sect. Unknown to history, Amoghavajra had another disciple, Huisu, who received all the religious instruments and dharma transmission. He then became the Dharma Lineage Bearer. Since then, Hanmi has been underground for over twelve centuries.

The Hanmi lineage has been passed on through one master per generation.

Samantbhadra is the name of the dharmakāya or the mind of the Buddhas. Vajradhara is the name for Samantabhadra's manifestation in Akaniṣṭha ('og min).

All lineages begin in Samantabhadra, but the Sambhogakāya who communicates this is called Vajradhara, Vajrasattva, etc. Sometimes you see texts in Dzogchen where Samantabhadra is directly teaching Vajradhara.

The state of the mahāmudra and the state of mahāsaṃdhi (rdzogs chen) are absolutely identical. The paths are very different.

Hi Greg:

There is no way to improve on something perfect already i.e. your primordial state. But there is something to do in terms of removing your ignorance of that fact.

Dzogchen is not "a way of being" per se. It is not a "style". It is remaining in a state of knowledge about one's primordial state, that's all.

Otherwise, at that time, Vajrasattva emanated Garab Dorje from his heart and he arrived in the presence of five hundred Indian panditas, “My teaching is superior to your eight vehicles, more amazing than the view of mahāmudra, union. If it is understood in the morning, buddhahood in the morning, if understood in the evening, the dharmas of buddhahood in the evening. It is the essence of all views, the intention of all buddhas, the apex of all yanas, the dharma of the true meaning, called “the great perfection”.

Sonam Wangchug said:
In what specific way is Dzogchen superior to mahamudra?

Malcolm wrote:
When we say Dzogchen is superior to mahāmudra, we are referring to paths. In general, we are referring to sutra mahāmudra and mahāmudra of the two stages. Ultimately however, the state of Dzogchen, the state of Prajñāpāramita, and the state of Mahāmudra are not different.

Dzogchen offers a more detailed explanation of what this state entails, how Samantabhadra's liberation occured (yes, Samantabhadra is the name for Dharmakāya in gsar ma tantra as well, originating in Yogatantra, actually), how the delusion of sentient beings occurred and so on, as well as many explanations specific to the path.

Sonam Wangchug said:
Secondly about the buddha-hood that reverts to a basis, What is the tibetan term for this? What exactly does reverting to a basis entail, and could you provide a quote from a dzogchen text, that states that non-dzogchen paths (including mahamudra) Revert to basis? Thanks

Malcolm wrote:
I'll have to get back to you on that:

Meantime, the notion of a primordial Buddhahood is directly refuted by Shri Singha in this text.

This is acceptable since a so called “primordial buddhahood” is not asserted. Full awakening is not possible without being free of the five afflictions. Both śravakas and pratyekabuddhas are abandon afflictions. Cittamatra and madhyamaka stop afflictions. Kriya, upa and yoga purify afflictions and transform them. The trio of mahāyoga, anuyoga and the view of union (mahāmudra) take afflictions into the path. The great perfection places afflictions a state of ceaseless objectlessness. It is not possible for wisdom to increase without giving up afflictions. Wisdom will not arise without purifying afflictions.

And, in giving advice about how Tibetans do not understand Dharma he states:

"Since you Tibetans are small-minded, you are newly associated with dharma. Since you make new friends easily, you become biased towards dharma. Since you are fickle, māras and gongpos will enter your hearts. In terms of great perfection, the dharma of the unsurpassed result, one is bound in fabrications by dharmas bound in concepts. Since you have not differentiated views, you grasp your own opinions. Since you have not differentiated what to accept and what to reject, you do as you please.  Since you have not differentiated the basis and the dharmakāya, you are not free from hope and fear."

The Drugpa master, Gyalwa Yangongpa states in The Treasury of the Essential Meaning: The Stages of the Four Yogas of Mahāmudrā



Now then, first it is necessary to recognize “mahāmudra” or phyag rgya chen po. In the sutras and tantras of the Sugatas and the instructions of the siddhas of the past a sequence of four mudrās is taught, since mahāmudrā manifests independent on the three other mudrās. Here, [4/a] the sequence of those instructions, the stages of the three mudrās are complete with meaning by power of blessings. Since one is caused to recognize mahāmudra with a special method, it is an immediate path. 

Now then “mahāmudra”: one person claims “Phyag is appearance, rgya is emptiness, chen po is union.” But this is a term for dharmamudra, not our term “mahāmudra.” All terms for clarity and emptiness are terms of samayamudrā. All terms of bliss and emptiness are terms for karmamudrā. Mahāmudra is the position of the Brahmin Saraha, whose position is that it is free from three conditions, beyond the four joys, and alone is distinct from luminous clarity. Since mahāmudrā does not depend on the condition of bliss, does not depend on the condition of clarity, and does not depend on the condition of non-conceptuality, it does not depend on the three conditions. From among the four joys, since the innate joy is demonstrated by the Guru, exists as it understood by the disciple, [4/b] it is an example wisdom with a demonstration and a demonstrator. 

But mahāmudra cannot be shown by a Guru, and cannot be understood by a disciple. It is not soiled by experience and sensations, it is not corrupted by realization and certainty, it is not divided by view, meditation and conduct, it is not sectioned into a basis, path and result, all of these phenomena of appearance and existence, samsara and nirvana are neither removed or added, bound or freed, are fixed with an antidote. Recognition of and self-liberation into one’s own state is called “mahāmudrā.” Luminous clarity is without appearances and free from extremes but mahāmudra is fresh appearances and knowing (rig pa), and because proliferation is self-liberated it is different than luminous clarity.

This is the real mahāmudra.

BTW, this real mahāmudra is beyond so called "essence" mahāmudra since essence mahāmudra depends in an introduction.

Malcolm wrote:
Dzogchen is not rocket science. It is very easy to understand if you have an open mind and you do not go around complicating things.

Sometimes, the biggest obstacle to understanding Dzogchen that people have is Buddhism, so they constantly try to compare Dzogchen with the vehicles of cause and result. This causes them to automatically deviate. Dzogchen is completely beyond cause and result. All notions of paths and stages are completely irrelevant in Dzogchen.

There are mainly one thing that matters in Dzogchen -- whether or not you are a fortunate person. If you are a fortunate person you will meet a master who has experience who can demonstrate to you your real condition and the methods to discover that for yourself. You do not have to be an educated person like me who has studied way too many books. There is a saying in Dzogchen, an illterate person who has personal experience of their real state will gain liberation far sooner than a Pandita who is expert in a hundred dharma systems but does not have that experience. Dzogchen is not intellectual. It is based on personal experience. You do not have to be literate, or particularly well educated to have that experience. Our friend adinatha will tell you that realization of Dzogchen based on the blessings of the lineage. But actually, it is based on recognizing a personal experience. Maybe we mean the same thing. Certainly having that recognition is wonderful thing, inexpressible, a cause for faith and a great blessing. But collecting blessings and reciting supplications will never get you that experience. Only an experienced master who has that experience will able to introduce it to you in a direct personal way. That is the best blessing.

It seems to be more a matter of personal choice. Rainbow body is rainbow body, whether you go longde, togal or yangti. Perhaps a yangti practitioner is going to say yangti is higher. But why would it be higher if the fruit is the same?

Malcolm wrote:
Faster, more direct, more methods.



adinatha said:
Aside from rainbow body, there is also the fruit of complete manifest buddhahood, like Longchenpa.

Malcolm wrote:
Same thing. Can't attain rainbow body without being a Buddha. As far as that Abhisambuddhahood [complete manifest buddhahood] in Dzogchen is considered a lesser result compared with Samyaksambuddhahood. The former is with remainder, the latter, without remainder.

Yangti higher than togal? Who told you that?

Namdrol said:
The yangti tantras.

adinatha said:
So what makes it higher than togal?


Malcolm wrote:
More methods, special methods, not taught in tögal. Even so, there has been some bleed over. One finds some methods of Yangti in cycles like Gongspa Zangthal and so on. Tögal is like the base for Yangti.

The simplest way to put it is that sems de works on with mind, but not with visions. In terms of the four visions klong sde works with space, but not with light. Tögal works with light, but not with dark. Yangti works with dark and other special methods which work with light. Since klong sde works with the four visions, this is why it is asserted that one can obtain rainbow body with klong sde. One cannot obtain rainbow body with sems sde.

This also the reason why it is asserted that one cannot obtain rainbow body with mahāmudra lacking tantric practices connected with the wisdom winds. I don't expect you to agree, but you should be aware of the reasoning.

Further, the yangti tantras assert that yangti is utter pinnacle of Dzogchen practice and theory. Perhaps the most famous yangti cycle is that of Dungtso Repa. The late Khetsun Zangpo was famous as one of the main promulgators of the Dungtso Repa Black Yangti teachings.

There are yangti cycles by Guru Chowang, Ngala Padma Dudul, Rigzin Chanchub Dorje, and so on.

As I keep stressing, there is a lot more to Dzogchen than Yeshe Lama and Thigle Gyacan. Can people obtain awakening from Yeshe Lama? Of course. Is there always more to learn, etc. Yes.

The story about the  Phagmodrupa and Sakya thing goes something like, if I am remembering correctly, that Phagomodrupa thought he had realized the path of seeing and his Sakya Lama confirmed it... Then he went to Gampopa and Gampopa said his path of seeing wasn't worth the tsampa ball in his hand... so from then on he followed the Gampopa rather than the Sakya Lama...


Malcolm wrote:
In an autobiographical note, Dorje Gyalpo mentions that after Gampopa passed away (recall, Phagmo Dru spent only a single year with Gampopa) he returned to Sakya, but that from his perspective Sachen seemed disinterested in seeing him. After that, he travelled to the place from which he derived his nickname, Phagmodru.

The relationship between Sachen and Phagmo Drupa is related in the Stearns book on the early history of Lamdre. Much of what was compiled into the famed Lamdre Yellow Book (Pod gser ma) was originally compiled by Phagmodrupa.

It is likely that the tension between Sakya and Drigung that exploded through someone misunderstanding a remark made by Sakya Pandita really stems from the soured relationship between Sachen and Phagmodrupa.

BTW, if Sachen said that Phagmodru had attained the path of seeing, he did. You like paths and stages, Sean -- Lamdre has unmistakeable signs of all the paths and stages laid out in detail. If you don't have that sign, then you don't have that realization. This sort of very detailed presentation of the paths and stages of the Vajrayāna path is a speciality of Lamdre.

Phagmodru's presentation of Lamdre is the only surviving lineage of Lamdre outside of Sakya. It is considered perfectly valid by Sakya and was reincorporated into Sakya at some point.

I am never removed from KDL's guru yoga no matter what practice I do. Words are secondary.

I have had now three important gurus die. The first one was Ngagpa Yeshe Dorje, his death propelled me into three year retreat (1993-1997). When KDL died in 2006, it was very sad for his students. Also when Khenpo Jigme Phunstok died, I was very sad since I did his practices in my retreat.

Nevertheless, they all are important, and I try to honor them with my study and practice. You might have figured out by now that I am a serious person. In that respect, I follow CHNN's temperament. We are both tigers.

I also like good wine, good scotch in moderation, good food, etc.

Having received at various times Chetsun Nyinthig, Nyinthig Yazhi, Thigle Gyacan, and so on from him, as well as most of his various terma transmissions, while driving him to VT one time I asked him once which of these practices he thought I ought to do. He responded by saying that all of the samayas of these practices were no longer perfect. He then said I should do his guru yoga. He then went on to explain that a) it was better to practice new termas b) while the terton in question was still alive since it would be more powerful. He then supplemented his comments by remarking that ChNN was an incredible [ngo msthar che] master of Dzogchen.

KDL gave different advice to different people. But his main focus was always on Dzogchen. He considered all his students to Dzogchen practitioners, first and foremost. He did not stress preliminary practices for Westerners, but instead emphasized some light sadhana like Drollo, Chö practice, etc., and Dzogchen first and foremost.

Love and family feeling is so precious. We had to learn to wear pants and collared shirts. Now you all have to learn to touch the father guru's feet. Then get up and take his hand with both hands and touch it to your forehead and kiss it three times. It immediately brings out a feeling of humility and love and tears will come out by themselves. And the guru softens and will share things that he never thought he would. You should try it. It opens you both up to an unbelievable possibility for the most precious dharma exchange. I swear. This is wisdom.

Malcolm wrote:
You really do not need to lecture me about guru devotion. I explained this to you already.

I am not demonstrative, especially online. I choose not to discuss these things online because I don't discuss my experience online. I understand your desire to want people to see things from your perspective. But you do need to allow that people are different and experience things in their own way. You have an effusive style. It would not get you very far with CHNN or KDL IMO, or maybe it would -- CHNN sees through people. If they are doing something which is not real, something contrived, he knows. When I first met ChNN privately, before offering a kata, I went to offer prostrations as is customary. He yelled at me, prevented me from doing them. But he accepted the kata. I will share only this much. After I met him, I was in a state of bliss for many weeks. High on Dzogchen. I am not an automaton -- just undemonstrative.

And as you know, we do not do prostrations to our teacher in Dzogchen Community by his express wishes.

I honor and respect my teachers through my persistent devotion to the Dharma they have taught me. That is sufficient, don't you think?

In the description of the fourth appearance of Togal, there are the two possible routes, you either look at your hand, etc. etc. I know that there are lineages that rely entirely on this text for the practice of Tregcho/Togal and yogis in Tibet who only practice this and nothing else. It is supposed to be the foremost instructions.

Is it your position that the Song of the Vajra is mengagde? My impression was that it is semsde.

it is not a position -- song of the vajra comes from the man ngag sde tantra Union of the Sun and Moon.

adinatha said:
I assume you hold Togal in high esteem. But then you somehow also think you still need to do chulen to dissolve the elements and attain rainbow body, right?
There are many reasons for chulen in Dzogchen. But yes, based on the teachings of both ChNN and KDL, chulen is a necessary secondary condition for attaining rainbow body. This is not just their teaching however, chulen is mentioned in the sgra thal gyur etc.
This means that Yeshe Lama is lying when it says its instructions result in Rainbow Body, because there is no mention of chulen in there.

Malcolm wrote:
No, the importance of chulen is commonly understood by Tibetan yogis. They do not need to have everything explained. For example, there is a bcud len text connected with Dechen Gyalmo in the klong chen snying thig called the Amrita of the Three Kāyas Chulen. In there it specifies that yogis who have abandoned activities must practice chulen continuously and that is it is contributing factor to awakening. It also specifies, among other things, that dharmakāya chulen has the power to separate the impurities of mind from the pure essence of rigpa. Perhaps you might want to revise your definition of chulen?


adinatha said:
I gather this is your position. However, there are high level masters in the Nyingma lineage who would take umbrage with this statement.

There is always someone to take umbrage with any statement. In the end, the only authority that counts is oneself.

This goes back to the Third Turning examples. When the clouds part and the sun shines through are the sunbeams developing? It's kind of silly to think so. When the crust of dirt around a gold nugget is chipped off, is the gold nugget developed? Also silly to think so. This is inside out level.

This will depend on the lineage. I don't see how enlightenment in one life is a slow path. Even Manjushrimitra or was it Vimalamitra had to practice outer rushen six months of the year and togal the other six for fifty years or something like that. Time is totally relative anyway.

Yes, but it is not included in the oral instructions that comprise the most secretive level of Kagyu. There chulen is explicitly said to belong to a lower level of practice, basically the two-stage yoga level with tummo and karmamudra.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, chulen something related to relative condition. It is also important for the reasons I have specified.


adinatha said:
No. The outer part of the method does indeed work from interdependence. Drikungs are particularly partial to interdependence. Lineage blessings are not to be underestimated. They are the source of power. But the inner realization is beyond interdependence. There's no latter without the former. Period.

Malcolm wrote:
There are five levels of dependent origination. The final one is called ultimate dependent origination. This exists in Kagyu because Phagmodru was a Lamdre practitioner for his entire life. His Lamdre texts were directly written down from the mouth of Sachen. Before Phagmodru met Gampopa, he was Sachen's main student.

YOu've said that Namkhai Norbu stresses knowledge over devotion, but this is like a chicken and egg thing for me.

Dzogchen practice is based on a personal experience, not concepts -- I think you will agree. That personal experience can be shown to anyone. Everyone has the same basis.  But if they have the karma for Dzogchen, then everyone has the same basic capacity and the rest depends in their personal diligence.

That depends on diligence -- most Dzogchen practitioners attain buddhahood in the bardo. Only those of best diligence attain buddhahood in this body in this lifetime.

For the reasons we have discussed above, I feel that the explanations Shakyamuni's sutras are more profound than the tantras sometimes. Consider how tantras arise. People want buddhahood now. Also some are not satisfied with what the buddha said earlier and demand more precision. Doubt gives rise to these in depth explanations of where everything comes from and where it is all going. Reading is not going to dispel that obscuration. It's a habit born from beginningless time. I contend that the buddha was never holding back. The ultimate fruit was always the same thing, because what's time got to do with it. If we want to get really down to it, this is all about love and what's that anyway? If Garab Dorje is right and we will all be enlightened, I don't mind going on and on and on. I can just practice love. Love is fantastic, miraculous; it actually has an energy wave to it. How pure this land would be if we only practice metta sadhana until the final eon. Such karma cannot be lost, so why not? Compassion cannot exist without sentient beings to liberate. Without compassion, there is no buddha. This buddha dynamic requires samsara. So what's the point abandoning it? Actually there is no point without it. Samsara is endless; therefore so is buddhahood.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, that is the difference between you and me. I consider Dzogchen alone to be definitive. Everything else is either provisional or intentional.

Compassion does not require sentient beings. A Buddha's compassion has not objects.

Compassion is part of the natural state of the original basis whether there are sentient beings or not.

Dzogchen answers the questions: how do sentient beings arise? Where does mind come from? Dzogchen is fundamentally different because of the range of questions it answers, answers often fundamentally in opposition to long cherished sutra dogmas.

Dzogchen is different because of its explanation of the basis.

Texts like Uttaratantra do not even approach the explanation of the basis given in Dzogchen -- none of the Sarma tantras do. And so on, et al. Blah blah blah.

Uttaratantra says sugatagarbha is dharmakāya; Dzogchen says that sugatagarbha is the four elements in one's body.

This is one reason why sometimes I don't like Longchenpa's explanations -- he is a scholar used to defending Dzogchen against critics, and sometimes he uses sutra doctrines from a Dzogchen perspective but does not inform people what he is doing. One of those uses is sugatagarbha doctrine. He uses it to try to get people to understand a particular point -- but in my opinion, not so successfully.

Part of what we've been debating about is the inseparability is why buddhahood is primordial and eternal. I take all my lessons from Vimala and Longchenpa.

Malcolm wrote:
I have been discussing with you why I think that taking the examples of in Uttaratantra literally is a mistake.

Basically, you are conflating the original general basis which we can term "natural buddhahood" with resultant buddhahood.

Padsambhava states:

Since The Rosary of Pearls also states “The stage of liberation is first”, there is liberation into the primordial original basis, that is called “the result of original purity exhausting phenomena”, that demonstrates the manner of the liberation of the final result.

This is subtle point, easily misunderstood.

The original basis,essence, nature and compassion, is termed "Buddhahood" since that is what is realized at the end of the path. But this is not what the Uttaratantra examples mean if taken literally. Essence, nature and compassion are one's potentiality. This is why Guru Rinpoche says:

After the mass of traces and the whole physical body of elements self-purifies, since the essence develops into kāyas (forms), it is not parted from nor put together with the three kāyas. Since the nature develops into omniscient wisdom, it is not parted from nor put together with the three wisdoms. Since compassion develops into activities of deeds, compassion is unceasing. Also that is stated in The Luminous Space:

The essence is the luminous empty jñānakāya,
nature and compassion are without partiality,
as they are totally inseparable, already Buddhahood.

So, in terms of a person's path, we can see that here there is a process of maturation of a potentiality.

Again:

As such, having given up the attached grasping of body, voice and mind with it’s physical matter, the body, speech, mind, qualities and activities develop and having given up the grasping of the five kāyas, there is self-arisen intrinsically clear self-liberation into the total original purity of the original basis.  The Self-Arisen states: 

The samsara of grasping at concepts is cleansed,
developing into the meaning of the jñānakāya itself,
that is to be called “Buddhahood.”

This is why, in this instance, the discussion about the liberation of Samantabhadra contrasted with the delusion of sentient beings is critical. If one does not understand this, and tries to apply the sugatagarbha teachings too literally to Dzogchen, then it becomes something very strange. And if one takes them literally in non-Dzogchen context, how is one different from the eternalist tirthikas?

Sure there is -- as Samputa clearly explains. But this is something Sakyas/Nyingmas and Kagyus do not agree on. Kaguyus basically assert what you just have -- there is only one level of buddhahood, the elventh bhumi. When we see breakdowns into more bhumis, these are just refinements of bodhisattva levels -- but still only one level of Buddhahood.

Sakyas and Nyingmapas do not see it that way. So we will agree to disagree. we see qualitative differences in the omniscience of the three levels or six levels of Buddhahood. The funny thing is meditatively, and in terms of direct introduction and so on Kagyu and Nyingma are closer. But in terms of philosophy and basic attitudes about the path and so Sakya and Nyingma are closer. This is why when one leaves Sakya or Kagyu, there is only one place to go.

Moreover, in Dzogchen there is a further disctinction between Abhisambudhas and Samyaksambuddhas.

Take the following into consideration about whether Garab Dorje was making illustrations or saying something quintessential. The account of the rise of the universe and the enlightenment of Samantabhadra would only hold true in itself is there was only one universe that exapnds and contracts. But, even Shakyamuni knew and all buddhas know, there are infinite universes. For every universe that expands, another contracts and vice-versa. This would mean, if you take Garab Dorje literally, that there is one Samantabhadra per universe. It would also seem to mean a buddha's omniscience is limited to one universe, which contradicts the meaning of omniscience. This is absurd. The nature of mind transcends temporarinesses.

Malcolm wrote:
There can be infinite Samantabhadras in infinite expanding and contracting universes. Garab Dorje was only taking about the first Buddha in our particular series of eons and the lineage of Buddhas of Dzogchen teachings in this universe. "Adi" does not mean primordial, it means "first". This is why the Tibetans translate "adi" as "thog ma".

For sure in Dzoghen.

But this is a standard (non-Kagyu) mahamudra terminology. Here ālaya just means the inseparable clarity and emptiness of the mind.

It is true that the alāya is deluded in Dzogchen.It is true the terma ālaya it is considered the ālaya vijñāna in Kagyu mahāmudra teachings, but in other texts, for example, the Seven Points of mind training ālaya is not considered to be the same as ālaya vijñāna.

The dharmakaya is not the alaya.

From a Dzogchen perspective, agreed. But the term is used differently in different schools.

Malcolm wrote:
From a Dzogchen perspective, agreed. But what is understood as luminous clarity in mahāmudra, which is taken as the basis [gzhi] and is taken as dharmakāya, is quite different than what is understood as luminous clarity in Dzogchen. Same word, very different meanings.

Same thing with the term "ālaya" -- yes in Drikung Mahāmudra, influenced a little by Dzogchen, they make a distinction between ālaya and the the basis.

adinatha said:
The mahamudra lineage is the dharmakaya lineage.

Malcolm wrote:
The various mahāmudra schools make the clarity, emptiness and inseparability of the mind into the three kāyas. They may term the basis differently, etc. But the meaning is that same.

This is not, ultimately, the approach of Dzogchen.

adinatha said:
Story about the universe and all that, sounds nice, but it makes Shakyamuni a liar, that his teachings don't end the cycle of birth and death, because a reversion to the basis of alaya would entail being returned to the cycle of samsara in the following universal cycle.

Malcolm wrote:
I am simply reporting what Garab Dorje, Padmasambhava, Shri Singha et al actually say. I don't need to interpret anything.

In Hīnayāna, Shakyamuni taught arhatship as buddhahood. In Mahāyana, he taught that arhatship was not buddhahood, and was inferior to buddhahood. And that in fact, after attaining arhatship, arhats would be roused from their nirodhasamapatti at some point and then they must traverse the paths of stages of Mahāyāna. So, was the Buddha lying in Hināyāna when he told his followers that arhatship was it?

In Vajrayāna, in the Samputa tantra it is clarified that there are three stages of Buddhahood. Two stages of Buddhas who do not recognize all phenomena as being the display of their own wisdom and the thireenth bhumi, Vajradhara, where all phenomena are so recognized. Does this make the Buddha a liar about Mahāyāna?

In Dzochen, there are enumerated another three stages, three more stages of those who dwell within wisdom, rendering the thirteenth bhumi a lower stage of buddhahood. Does this make the Buddha a liar about Vajrayāna?

In any event, this notion of "Buddhahood that reverts to the basis [gzhi, not kun gzhi]" as an inferior buddhahood that is not complete is well attested in Dzogchen. It has to be the case because as Garab Dorje points out, all sentient beings in the previous eon attain buddhahood by the end of the eon. This is explicitly stated by Garab Dorje in the commentary I mentioned to above.

But to illustrate my point further, the Drikung view is Dzogchen is definitely subordinated. For example, Jigten Sumgon states in Gongcik: “The supreme realization is not touched by the three great ones.” This is echoe of a statement by Gampopoa to his nephew, Gomchung.

But I don't during Jigten Sumgon's time Nyingthig was wide spread. At this point in history Nyingma was very much on the decline.

Well, the counter of this among high Kagyu lamas is that the realization of Dzogchen masters is rather small compared to the realization and activities of the great Kagyu masters. There's always another side, and it's not universally accepted that Dzogchen is the highest or the equal of Mahamudra. Not so much because the teachings are better or worse, but because the samayas and the power of Kagyu lineages are supreme.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, and the Sakyapas say that both the Kagyus and the Nyingmapas exaggerate their masters realizations, blah blah blah, and that the Samaya of Sakya lineages is the purest, blah blah blah...

I base my understanding on what these teachings actually say. Not on gossip and competition.

So, having received the Mahāmudra teachings of both Kagyu (Karma and Drikung) and Sakya (Lamdre/Yogini) and also many Dzogchen teachings, I decided for myself that Dzogchen was best, not because someone told me it was best, but because there are too many special features of Dzogchen that are unique and cannot be found elsewhere.

Nevertheless, all of these Vajrayāna teachings are profound.

Thanks Sean -- from a Dzogchen perspective, one must differentiate between the ālaya and the basis. The ālaya is taking about the nature of the mind i.e. inseparable clarity and emptiness. But the basis is beyond the mind -- it is talking about the basis of everything, mind, the five elements, etc.

So there is a basis beyond the mind from a Dzogchen POV.

When you meet a guru who will give you the teachings for which you yearn -- your job is to put them into practice. It is not disrespectful to your other gurus to move on until you find the one who give you the teachings you desire. As you practice more, you learn more, and often you have to move on to find teachings you need. This is normal. Sometimes you have to get teachings from some other teacher to make sense of the teachings you originally got. Etc. But the point is you must never be passive. When you understand more or less perfectly the teaching you desire, then you must put it into practice. You have no excuse of you don't.

A guru's job is not to deal with our neurotic bullshit. It is amazing that they put up with any of it at all. A Guru's job is simply to give teachings for our own liberation.

Great. Thank you.

Now, there is not just 1 site where Rinpoche's retreats and webcasts are located, right?

Another thing I was wondering about though. Will practicing the methods described in the Precious Vase allow me to recognize Rigpa, even without having any further close contact to Rinpoche? How does that work exactly?

And, you told Mr. Gordo it all comes down to interest and diligence, but there seem to be so many people who practice Dzogchen, who then just give up because they don't get results. How come these people don't get what they are looking for? Are they all practicing wrong? You yourself said it is so subtle that it is hard to understand. Doesn't one need a kind of close relationship with a teacher then?

Many thanks once again,

This is the main webcast site.

Rigpa is just your knowledge of your state. So yes, practicing this methods in these books will being you to that knowledge.

You try to listen to as many retreats as you can.

They are mostly being broadcast without restriction these days and if you become a member you can listen to replays.

You just need to hear the teachings a lot -- that is the advantage. If you have serious question, you can always email Rinpoche.

And you must try to go meet him in person.

Primordial Buddha: beginningless vidya. Youthful vase body. Five lights. Self-sprung simultaneous appearances of samsara and nirvana. Samsara spontaneously emptied because no three times, due to immediate responsiveness of dharmakaya.

Malcolm wrote:
Ok, it is important to understand three things: the general original basis, the reality of the basis, and how ignorance manifests. In addition to that it is necessary to know that Garab Dorje's commentary on the Single Son of the Buddha's tantras supplies a necessary understanding I will address below at the section on the arising of the basis.

The Unwritten Tantra (Yi ge med pa describes how the general original basis exists:

“There is no object to investigate within the view of self-originated wisdom: nothing went before, nothing happens later, nothing is present now at all. Action does not exist. Traces do not exist. Ignorance does not exist. Mind does not exist. Discriminating wisdom does not exist. Samsara does not exist.  Nirvana does not exist. Even vidyā itself does not exist i.e. nothing at all appears in wisdom. That arose from not grasping anything.”

This is the state of original purity, The Blazing Lamp says:
Within initial original purity
the nature is like so:
not made by anyone, manifesting naturally,
the nature is already just so.

In this state, The Rosary of Pearls states:
The mere term delusion cannot be described
within the original purity of the initial state,
likewise, how can there be non-delusion?
Therefore, pure of delusion from the beginning.

The Heart Mirror states “ All phenomena of the basis must be understood as the trio of essence, nature and compassion. All phenomena of the essence must be understood as emptiness. All phenomena of the nature must be understood as luminosity. All phenomena of compassion must be understood as pervading all sentient beings. ”

So, of course, there must be essence, nature and compassion, timelessly present as the basis. Without these wisdoms, there can be no nirvana and no samsara. We can term these three "sugatagarbha" if we like. Padmasambhava states in the Clear Mirror:

Those three wisdoms pervade Samantabhadra and sentient beings down to the tiniest creature without any discrimination of good or bad, high or low.

Since these three wisdoms are themselves not established in anyway at all, we can be sure we are free from eternalism. Since these three natures always appear, we are free from annihilationism.

adinatha said:
Vidya arises simultaneously with 8 vijnana. A moment of nonapprehension: sentient being. A moment of apprehension: Samantabhadra. No two moments, even though deluded discriminating mind sees two moments and re-liberation.

Malcolm wrote:
In the system of the Dzogchen Nyinghig three causes of ignorance are described -- those three are essence, nature and compassion. This is why there are three ignorances in this system. The system of explanation of Gongpa Zangthal is a little different, with only two ignorances -- we will continue with the Dzogchen Nyinthig system.

According to Garab Dorje, prior to the arising of the basis which is latent during the dark eon interval, nevertheless there are traces of affliction and action remaining from the previous eon. Because of these traces, the basis is stirred, the five lights appear and so on (this is why the Dzogcgen doctrine of two different kinds of Buddhahood is critical -- the first, the buddhahood that reverts the basis is the buddhahood asserted by all lower vehicles. The buddhahood that does not revert to the basis is the preserve of only Dzogchen).

The Gongpa Zangthal cycle supplies that during the arising of basis there is a neutral awareness (shes pa lung ma bstan) in the basis that does not recognize itself. This non-recognition is the innate ignorance. When this neutral awareness cognizes the five lights there is a dividing line between nirvana and samsara. When a neutral awareness recognizes the appearance of the basis as its own appearances it is is prajñā and is immediately liberated. That is Samantabhadra. A neutral awareness that does not recognize appearances as its own appearances immediately is the imputing ignorance, and samsara begins (again) because subject and object is imputed. This is all very clearly explained in detail in the eleven topics of Dzogchen Nyinthig. This is also clearly explained by Khenpo Ngawang Palzang.

adinatha said:
Key point: innate enlightenment arises simultaneously with innate ignorance.

Malcolm wrote:
After the basis arises, innate ignorance is first and even Samantabhadra has it. There is period where a neutral awareness does not recognize itself in anyway. That is the innate ignorance. It (the neutral awareness) can only recognize itself through the display of five lights. When it recognizes that display as its own display, then this is the liberation of Samantabhadra without the performance of an iota of virtue. We on the other hand did not recognize these five lights as our own display, and for us, samsara began, without even an particle of non-virtue having been done.

According to Dzogchen teachings, all sentient being attain Buddhahood by the end of the eon -- this is very clearly stated by Garab Dorje in the commentary above. But there are two kinds of Buddhahood, and as I said above, there is only Buddhahood that does not revert to the basis, and that is the Buddhahood attained through Dzogchen methods. The Buddhahood of other vehicles reverts to the basis, without the corresponding result.

Now then, the reason why we cannot take these metaphors in Uttaratantra literally is that the basis is not Buddhahood. If the basis were Buddhahood, there would be no need for any kind of recognition.

In Dzogchen, there is a difference between the basis and the result. The difference is simply vidyā and avidyā and the recognition and non-recognition that comes from those.

Further, it is not enough merely to understand the general original basis. One must also understand the human body as a basis.

I will not discuss this here since it is not a proper topic.

Yes, your Drikung Kagyu teachers.

And my Dzogchen teachers.
Pardon me for stating the obvious, but:

Dzogchen is an important part of Drikung Kagyu through the Yangzab cycle of termas. And there are qualified Dzogchen teachers within the Drikung. So it has no reason to denigrate Dzogchen or elevate Mahamudra. Both are a part of Drikung.


Malcolm wrote:
Hi Jinzang:

I also have Drikiung teachers such as Gyalpo Rinpoche and Traga Rinpoche. He and Traga Rinpoche are the premier qualified Dzogchen teachers within Drikung, IMO.

Dzogchen may be a part of Drikung, but it is generally encased in the overall Drikung approach. This is not a bad thing, per se -- that depends on the student. However there is a need among Sarma teachers to make their completion stage practices equivalent on some level with Dzogchen teachings -- we see this in the writings of Sakya Pandita, we see this with HH Dalai Lama's teachings, etc.

Side note: Yangzab, in the Tibetan context, largely considered an "Ani practice", and was mostly practiced in nunneries. Yangzab is a pure Nyingma cycle. The best commentary on Yangzab was not written by a Drikung master, it was written by one of Dudjom Lingpa's sons for which Traga Rinpoche gave the transmission.

Yangthang Tulku, when giving the preliminary practice section for Yeshe Lama many years ago, remarked that for Mahāmudra you have to be very smart, because there are not so many methods. Dzogchen was easier (hence better as easier is always better) because it had many methods.

You may not like this fact, but indeed there are many Dzogchen teachings that assert that Dzogchen is superior to Mahāmudra, identified in this context as the view that arises from anuyoga.

You do not have to believe it. But do not make the mistake of thinking that the Dzogchen tradition does not hold itself as unique and superior, for it does.

The point of my saying this is not to make other people feel bad. The point of my saying this is let people understand that while it may be the case that in the Kagyu schools there is an general consensus that Mahamudra and Dzogchen are just different ways to get to the same result, this consensus is not shared by the Nyingma school or by the textual system of Dzogchen. I am not suggesting that one must agree with the Dzogchen POV, merely that it exists.

So yes, the total field of emptiness has both ignorance and buddhahood.

Namdrol said:
You did not answer the question:

Either you are not a Buddha because you made a mistake, or Buddhas make mistakes.

adinatha said:
Your question is a nonstarter, because it's limited to temporal contingent logic. Your question assumes a before and after or a yes or no. Before you can become a buddha you have to stop making a mistake. Or you were a buddha, but then you made a mistake. But there is no before or after, no sentient beings or buddha.

Look at the faces and vase gestalt. Which comes first the face on the left, the face on the right or the vase in the middle? Are they simultaneous or none at all? Is black first or white? Is the vase correct and the faces incorrect or vice versa? Is it right to not make these discriminations and wrong to do so? Where is the vase or faces, really? So do you actually see these somewhere? These discriminations are no where and yet there somehow; that's the unavoidable reality. It is a most profound and deep mystery. Pure magical display. But it's not a mistake. Even the discriminations are just like the gestalt display, absent yet apparent.

A Buddha doesn't conceptualize these forms or a buddha seer, and just leaves it all be. Yet the whole gestalt of emptiness and forms appears magically. Once you see how this is the case, you will be in the Ati dimension of instant intuition. A sentient being sees this or that and holds to it. But it's not right or wrong. Consistently trying to hold to one side would go against its real nature, and would result in a consistent exertion of energy that results in suffering. A sentient being isn't making a mistake; it's a suffering. But just like there are two faces, there is suffering and nirvana.

Perception's fact is not touched by time or logic. Using the word as a verb instead of a noun, "to buddha" is to see the gestalt-like quality of all appearances and possibilities, where there is arising of form, no arising of form, seeing and no seer, all at once and not at all, just pure magical display with no trace of a source. Appearance is no appearance.

In the example of the Buddha inside the decaying lotus. You see the Buddha inside the decaying lotus. The decaying lotus is not hiding the buddha. The decaying lotus is luminous too. Even though the lotus emits a foul odor, there's buddha. In the example of Indra's face reflecting in all realms, every reflection is this gestalt-like buddhahood in action. You have to see that emptiness encompasses both extremes of ignorant sentient being and omniscient buddhahood. It is one total tathagatagarbha.

The this vision is the fruit which is inseparable from bliss and equanimity. It's not possibly the wrong path, because it is the end of the path. Once understood, there's nothing left to do, one's instant intuition is inseparable from omniscience and sentient beings are liberated in natural course.

coldmountain said:
I appreciate the response. As I've said before, by way of being forthright about where I'm coming from, I really don't believe in mind or matter - I don't know what those words actually refer to. All I know is experience and reason, I don't have any access to any reified stuff called mind or matter. What I’m really caught up in is evidence. And I wouldn't dismiss the validity of analysis/reductionism too much since Buddhism has employed it since the very beginning to establish anatta.

You think, therefore you have a mind. That mind perceives matter as color, shape, sound, taste, odor and texture.

I'm honestly confused about your ontology here. First you said you are not a dualist, then you claim that mind "inhabits" a body/brain and that the body/brain are conduits of mind. What is this if not classical dualism in a nutshell?
No, it is not. It is more like talking about a flower and its scent.

Again, first you say that cognition is dependent on the brain and then that cognition does not take place in the brain. If words have any meaning, then there has to be some reconciliation here. Is it your view that matter is mind -- that they are ontologically identical -- or is it your view that they are different? If they are different, on what grounds are the two distinguished?
Sentient beings think. It is a function of their being sentient. Their minds and their bodies form a non-dual continuum. Mind and matter are inseparable. There is never any mind in absence of matter. We talk about them as separate, but they are not really separate. The reason is that we do not conceive that matter thinks. But those who assume mind is a material process do not understand thought as anything more than a bunch of chemical reactions in a nervous system and therefore, they cannot imagine anything beyond this. We talk about mind and matter dualistically because it is obvious that thought influences matter and matter influences thought. But they are no more separate than heat and your body.

Buddhism seems to impose a problem I otherwise would not even have any inkling of: rebirth.
Buddhism makes no sense without rebirth.

I do not approach reality so dualistically. Let me put it this way: if someone gets a disease, is that the result of karma? I was diagnosed with diabetes a couple years ago. Is this the fruit of a past life? Or is it genetics? My father was diagnosed around the same age. Genetics suffices to explain this, and modern medicine is what keeps me going - whereas a Buddhist living in the pre-scientific world might believe such an occurrence to be the result of karma. And conversely, believing in karma never resulted in finding a cure/treatment for the actual cause of disease, which is not the result of a moral cause but a, well, physical one - whatever "physical" really means. Clearly one of these theories about the cause of disease is right and one is wrong. One is relevant and the other superfluous.
They can both be right, both karma and genetics. Your karma was to be reborn a human being, and you selected parents in the bardo, one of whom had a predisposition to diabetes. Both explanations are true.
I understand, at least in some measure, and I take seriously the truth that there is more to reality than can be objectified. If I didn't then I couldn't take many of the Buddhist ontological claims seriously, and I do. Perhaps "reality" in the reified, abstracted sense can be called the "surface", but it seems to me that one who rejects science wholesale in such a way is really imposing a deeply dualistic conception of reality where the "outer" reality apparently has nothing to do with the inner.

Malcolm wrote:
I did not say outer has nothing to do with the inner, I said science only explains the surface of reality. It does not plumb the depths.

My point was that no one can answer these questions for you in a satisfactory way.

You are trying to reconcile an experiential phenomenology with reductionist science. It won't work. You are too caught up in matter. Matter is intelligent, this is obvious because your body is made of matter and you are also a thinking being. Human consciousness is a function of the whole complex of what we call human. The same goes for bats, and so on. Your cognitive limitations are imposed by the body you inhabit unless you cultivate samadhis. If you won't train in samadhi, there is no way you can ascertain the Buddha's teachings about such things as rebirth and karma. If you need someone else to sign of on the truth of your experience, you will never attain awakening. Of course we can engage in lengthy sociological analysis of karma and how it is used as a power structure to keep people in their place. No doubt those cloaked in the mantle of Buddhism have used this teaching to try and keep people in their place. However, karma is not fixed, and it can be changed. This is what I mean when I say these questions are not helping you. They have nothing to do with your experience as a practitioner. There is only one way that experience can be gained -- through cultivating practice.

Until you break through doubt, your meditation practice will never advance to insight and will remain at the level of shamatha. Shamtha is great, but until you cut through doubt, it will never advance to Vipashyāna. You will never remove your doubts about such things as rebirth and so on until you have personal experience of rebirth, memories of past lives you could not possibly invent.

Buddhadharma is deeper than science. Science only explains the surface of reality, it does not explain reality.

Believe it or not, in the Drikung Kagyu tradition, there is pointing out  and the "ngondro" come after as a way to fully recognize it, particularly guru yoga, vajrasattva and mandala. Here the practice is to be in the state of mahamudra while you do these practices and one's mind becomes much more vivid and relaxed. Namkai Norbu also says that doing a practice like vajrasattva can increase clarity after a pointing out or direct intro.


Malcolm wrote:
Any practice one does can increase clarity after receiving transmission.

The question however was why our teacher in the Dzogchen Community does not approach ngondro the way it is done in other dharma communities. So when we do Vajrasattva practice, for example, or the Longsal preliminary practice which is connected with Vajrasattva and the purification of the six lokas there is never any idea that we have to accumulate a certain number or do it for a certain length of time.  Same thing applies to deity yoga -- there is never any suggestion that it is important to do one hundred thousand per syllable of a given mantra, for example. What it is important is connecting with one's primordial state. If there is a yidam in Dzogchen Community, it is that. So therefore, reciting a certain number of mantras to finish a deity retreat as in Tantric practice is not the principle in our community because our teacher approaches the teachings differently than do other teachers.

There are certain exceptions to this related to SMS training. But SMS is an option, not a requirement. SMS was originally designed as a teacher training program. According to Rinpoche, to be able to give lungs, one must complete a major deity retreat in a proper way, very precisely. So in SMS there is a very modified tantric ngondro, as well as a three roots requirement.

You keep using this word "intentional," what do you mean by this?

I'm saying these examples are necessary to understanding the Ati and Mahamudra meaning of dharmakaya as the totality of "appearances and possibilities." The totality of all appearances and possibilities has two purposes, the picture of total completion subsuming the three times, and the inner practice of nonattachment and effortlessness. These two go together, and the examples open up these meanings on many many levels. These examples are extremely profound and should be contemplated often.

Malcolm wrote:
Intentional means "says one thing, means another". It is different than provisional and not definitive.

If you are asserting that the husk or decaying lotus is an appearance, for example, and the Buddha inside it is a possibility, then you are asserting that the examples may not be taken literally, and that they merely point to a possibility for a sentient being to awaken despite his/her appearance of suffering.

There's a funny story that I'll tell here to illustrate the importance of keeping an open mind and having a solid theoretical background even before starting to practice meditation.

I met this guy from Argentina, deep into the psychedelic scene, who was absolutely convinced he had gained enlightenment while listening to trance music under the influence of psychedelic substances. His conception of enlightenment was quite simple and had more to do with getting euphoric and dazed, thus not suffering, than anything else.

Now, he was completely convinced he was enlightened. Unmovable about it. It was impossible to argue with him since he thought he had "The Experience". I think he was just tripping.

This is a clear example of how delusion makes us go AWOL and why we shouldn't trust the blind to lead the blind. Materialist scientists, concerning the nature of consciousness, are no different than this guy. Just a different sort of blindness, that's all.

Just for clarification, what you explained above is a distinctively Vajrayana perspective, right?  Is anything similar found in (sutric) Mahayana or Theravada?

My studies, such as they are, have mostly been in Ch'an and Theravada and I don't recall encountering a similar schema. In Theravada, as I understand it, consciousness re-arises along with the material aggregates -- there's no point at which it can  be said to be separated from them, unless one is reborn into a "formless realm". Even those Theravada teachers who accept an intermediary or bardo-like state insist it involves some sort of subtle body.

Yes, that subtle body is constituted from vāyu. In the bardo, one has all five aggregates -- one's rupaskandha is made of vāyu which also has the potentiality of the other four elements.

The Vajrayāna answer for that is that the mind is inseparably wed to a function of matter called vāyu, wind. The alāyavijñāna, bound to the mahāprāṇavāyu tranfers through the bardo from one body to the next. That wind/mind is also impermanent in the sense that it is momentary.

To preface, everything involving one's mind is involves belief. The idea that one has "personal experience" of anything is a belief system. Mental experience is always a meditated second-order cognition. Sense cognitions are non-conceptual.

That being said, I have some unclear recollections of past lives. Those experiences where stronger during the time I spent in Central Tibet.

I am certain that given sufficient time, and opportunity I could enhance those memories. But having memories of past lives is not the point of Dharma practice. But if you do sufficient practice, then you will verify the existence of dhyana realm devas too, and so on, as have many people who have spent time cultivating the jhanas in the Vipassana system. This is because cultivating dhyana affects one's sense organs and puts their experiential sphere in the form realms even though someone is physically located in the desire realm. I have a little of this experience as well. However, nothing that will stand up to so called "empirical" double blind studies. Recall of past lives cannot be scientifically tested for because it depends on developing certain meditative skills. But enough people have developed those skills and confirmed similar phenomena over the course of Buddhist history.

Of course, skeptics will dismiss such findings as narrative driven.

But beyond that, you have to recall that Buddha's insight into dependent origination was predicated on his recollection of his own past lives. This is an unalterable fact.

Hi Mike:

Past lives are verifiable. You just have to meditate a lot. Just as the Buddha did. You don't have to be a Buddha to verify rebirth. You just have remember your past lives very well, as the Buddha did prior to his awakening. Recall of past lives is a mundane skill accruing from meditation. It does not require attainment of awakening. It does require some degree of attainment of meditative stabilization.

Dharma is not solely based on appeals to authority. The Buddha suggested that anyone can develop these powers of the mind -- such as recall of one's past lives and so on -- such teachings are too pervasive in Buddhist literature to be doubted that this is really what the Buddha intended i.e. that the Dharma was taught in order to free people from continual rebirth in samsara.

Tashi delek,  

Yes like Namdrol wrote, we will get a hard time with the import of herbs / precious pills / TCM patent pills here in the Netherlands c.q. Europe.
Further can these TCM pills be stored for about 3 - 5 years. 
I import my medicine normally out of China ( patent pills) and can help my patients very good with these herbal pills.
But what to do at the moment, in case of a prohibition, i have no idea. 
Maybe one of you has some smart suggestions? That would be welcome

Then in case that a smoke like weed/pot could be a medicine then it could be used. I guess that to smooke it is permitted, but if it would then be a medical subject, so that it would be allowed in TCM and TTM, i don't know.

Best wishes for our practice

Interestingly I recall seeing Hakeda's Kukai: Major Works classified under the category of "Pantheism".

I think the problem is that in Hakeda's time he was writing for a community of predominately Christian scholars and had to make use of the standard religious studies lexicon of the time. Other authors who wrote on Buddhism used words like "the Church" when referring to Buddhist institutions. Using words from Christian theology only compounded misunderstandings and the presentation of Buddhism in the west.

What's your opinion of the Men Tsee Khang precious pills? Can you recommend any other authentic source? Dr Dhonden did warn me against inferior sources. Especially from some of the little clinics around Dharamsala.

About 12 years ago I actually had some that were made by Khenpo Troru Tsenam, but they are long used.

Namdrol said:
As I said, "as translated" --


"all dharmas entirely all true/real thus"

This is definitely off. Not Buddhist.

Huseng said:
"all dharmas entirely all true/real thus"

That last character reading as "true/real" (zhen 真) might be an abbreviation for zhenru 真如 which is suchness. Given that the sentence pattern here is made up of four-character segments this is probably the case. In Literary Chinese they have a habit of maintaining four-character segments and will abbreviate binomials to make them fit into the sequence. It leads to a lot of confusion as one might imagine.

So it would probably be best read as:

"all dharmas entirely all suchness thus"

Looking at the Chinese a bit closer I'm sure that the zhen 真 here is an abbreviation for zhenru 真如 because in the following sentence you get the other half of the binomial appearing (ru 如).

This section of the text is saying that all dharmas are suchness, therefore they need not be rejected or affirmed (pointed to). They conventionally exist and their conventional existence need not be rejected or affirmed when the principle is understood.

Do you see anything wrong with saying that all dharmas are entirely suchness?

"therefore all things from the beginning transcend all forms of verbalization, description, and conceptualization and are, in the final analysis, undifferentiated, free from alteration, and indestructible. They are only of the One Mind; hence the name Suchness."

Huseng said:
I'm looking at the Chinese and that last sentence has an additional part.

《大乘起信論》卷1：「唯是一心故名真如，以一切言說假名無實，但隨妄念不可得故。」(CBETA, T32, no. 1666, p. 576, a12-14)

"They are only just one mind ergo the name suchness because all language and provisional appellations have no reality only accompanying delusional thoughts which are unattainable. "

The "they" at the beginning is referring to "all dharmas" (一切法). "Transcend" is also not a good translation for li 離 which just means "apart from".

This is really just a Cittamatra position. Such remarks are made in the context of epistemology and not ontology. Mind here is equated to suchness. Is that really eternalist?

"But the essence of Suchness itself cannot be put an end to, for all things in their Absolute aspect are real; nor is there anything which needs to be pointed out as real, for all things are equally in the state of Suchness. It should be understood that all things are incapable of being verbally explained or thought of; hence the name Suchness."

As translated, this is a form of realism very similar to Kashmiri Shaivism.
《大乘起信論》卷1：「此真如體無有可遣，以一切法悉皆真故；亦無可立，以一切法皆同如故。當知一切法不可說、不可念故，名為真如。」(CBETA, T32, no. 1666, p. 576, a14-18)
[3]極＝相【金】。

Unfortunately you are relying on a bad translation.

This line ...
for all things in their Absolute aspect are real
...is an interpretation rather than a translation.

If you look at the Chinese and literally translate it word for word it sounds like this:

以一切法悉皆真故
[instrumental particle] all dharmas entirely all true/real thus

I don't see where the translator got "Absolute aspect" from. This section of the text is talking about how conventional phenomena and the principle behind them complement each other.

That depends on who you ask. In Tibetan Buddhism, according to the Sakya school, tathāgatagarbha is the union of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind. According to the Gelugpa school, it is the potential for sentient beings to awaken since they lack inherent existence; according to the Jonang school, it refers to the innate qualities of the mind which expresses itself in terms of omniscience, etc, when adventitious obscurations are removed. In Nyingma, tathāgatagarbha also generally refers to union of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind.

There is only one Indian commentary on this issue -- the Uttaratantra and its commentary by Asanga.

Oh, it is simple. Norbu RInpoche wrote a long commentary when he was younger.

Apart from minor differences in in grammar, the words are the same.

Based on that, Norbu Rinpoche himself decided that it must be true that he is the reincarnation of Adzom Drugpa.

Adzom Drugpa was the most important Dzogchen Guru of the early twentieth century for many reasons, not least of which he was the main Dzogchen disciple of Khyentse Wangpo. Chogyal Namkhai Norbu is the most important Dzogchen master alive today. Of course, there are many Dzogchen masters, and to their own students, they are the most important.

Anyway, I forgot to mention, I don't find the hermeneutics of the three turnings very convincing on any level, either doctrinally, since the third turning sutras often contradict each other, or historically.

I prefer the hermeneutics of Guhyasamaja i.e. "The single vajra word was heard differently by those of differing capacities."

It is not an existence, as the passage you cite above from the UT shows. Jñāna is free from extremes. It is inappropriate to call it an "existence".

Further, Jñāna is not an object, so it cannot be directly perceived (in sūtra). It is the personal intuition of reality, however.

Lankavatara Sutra


Malcolm wrote:
Lankavatara:

27. An ego-soul is a truth belonging to thought-construction, in which there is no real reality; the self-nature of the Skandhas is also a thought-construction, as there is no reality in it.

121. [According to the Buddha,] there is nothing in the world but the Mind itself, and all that is of duality has its rise from the Mind and is seen as perceived and perceiving; an ego-soul and what belongs to it—they exist not.

(211)...Mahamati, at the eighth stage the Bodhisattva-Mahasattvas, Sravakas, and Pratyekabuddhas cease cherishing discriminative ideas that arise from the Citta, Mana and Manovijnana. From the first stage up to the sixth, they perceive that the triple world is no more than the Citta. Manas, and Manovijnana, that as it is born of a discriminating mind there is no ego-soul and what belongs to it, and that there is no falling into the multitudinousness of external objects except through [the discrimination of] the Mind itself.

(220)...The Blessed One said this to him: Mahamati, the Tathagata-garbha holds within it the cause for both good and evil, and by it all the forms of existence are produced. Like an actor it takes on a variety of forms, and [in itself] is devoid of an ego-soul and what belongs to it.

(225)...Said the Blessed One: Mahamati, the ignorant cling to names, ideas, and signs; their minds move along [these channels]. As thus they move along, they feed on multiplicities of objects, and fall into the notion of an ego-soul and what belongs to it, and cling to salutary appearances. As thus they cling, there is a reversion to ignorance, and they become tainted, karma born of greed, anger, and folly is accumulated. As karma is accumulated again and again, their minds become swathed in the cocoon of discrimination as the silk-worm; and, transmigrating in the ocean of birth-and-death (gati), they are unable, like the water-drawing wheel, to move forward. And because of folly, they do not understand that all things are like Maya, a mirage, the moon in water, and have no self-substance to be imagined as an ego-soul and its belongings; that things rise from their false discrimination; that they are devoid of qualified and qualifying; and have nothing to do with the course of birth, abiding, and destruction; that they are born of the discrimination of what is only seen of the Mind itself; and assert1 that they are born of Isvara, time, atoms, or a supreme spirit, for they follow names and appearances. Mahamati, the ignorant move along with appearances.

281. There are no Skandhas in Nirvana, nor is there an ego-soul, nor any individual signs; (302) by entering into the Mind-only, one escapes from becoming attached to emancipation.

739. Those theorisers who are without knowledge are frightened at eternalism and nihilism; (357) the ignorant are unable to distinguish between the Samskrita, the Asamskrita, and the ego-soul.

851. The ego-soul is not, and the mind is born; how does this evolving come about? Is it not said that its appearing is like a river, a lamp, and a seed?

Obviously, the treatment of Atman in the Lanka is complicated and cannot be neatly summarized in one sentence.

and I don't believe in a "soul" that is separate from this Unity.
Advaita or Kashmir Shaivism again.

I'm also one of those people who seems to be pre-programmed by his mind to believing in something that could be called as "God". I'm a panentheist and see everything as what I consider as God, but that God to transcend everything too, and that our "souls" are a part of that being.
Advaita or Kashmir Shaivism again.


I'm comfortable using the term 'God' when referring to the Adibuddha/Dharmakaya Unmanifest/Amitābha (*from the "Eternal Buddha" perspective), and I'm comfort able using the term 'True Self' or 'Soul', when referring to the Buddha-nature/Mindstream & Base Consciousness together. I use "God", because that's an immediately accessible term for me - but I use it in a panentheistic (God is in all and beyond all) and transpersonal (does not intervene and make prophets and stuff, but is not an unfeeling, personality-less, non-sapient entity).
You are not using these terms as intended.
Regarding Soul: Effectively, it's our "True Selves", free some skandhic-ness: one with the Dharmakāya, our Buddha-nature, and pretty much the Buddha-nature/Mindstream & Base Consciousness together. Possibly even a Self of Nirvāṇic permanency beyond the skandhic mundane world, but I'm not sure at the moment.
There is no basis. Dharmakāya is not something which exists. It is something, according to Dzogchen, that completely lacks any basis or foundation. Dharmakāya is a complete and total emptiness. It is not however a void emptiness, like space i.e. mere absence. Dharmakāya is original purity.
Soul = Buddha-nature from a Tathāgathagarbha Sūtra and Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra interpretation. Not an "I" or ego-self.
The Lanka-avatara sutra was written to correct the misunderstanding that some gained from the ten tathāgatagarbha sutras that tathātagarbha was equivalent to a soul.

We can say there is a "cause and effect" relationship at work here, but we cannot point to anything in the nature of the flame, or in either candle, that is unchanging and uniquely defining. Nonetheless, there is some continuum of energy or heat which was "passed" from the stub to the new candle....though that energy or heat can't be isolated.

Thanks, everyone. I have to admit to being slightly overwhelmed by the responses to this topic. There seems to be so many different paths and branches to Buddhism, as well as that, a lot of the terminology here has no meaning to me as yet. I suppose I should start by reading the Kunjed Gyalpo. I hope it's easy to get hold of, there's a lot here I don't understand.

As for how I would define God, I would define God as the power and force existent in all things to whom we are ultimately answerable and who has complete control over the universe. So I mean God in a very absolute sense. I have always felt a connection with that God - or what I would define as such. And God has always been good to me when I have needed help [for which I ask very very rarely]. So when one says "what has God ever done for you?" I would answer with, "the things I have asked for".

It may be worth reading the Kunjed Gyalpo (aka Kulayarāja Tantra). That's like, a goldmine.  Here's two excerpts:

" ... everything is Me, the All-Creating Sovereign, mind of perfect purity ... I am the cause of all things. I am the stem of all things. I am the ground of all things. I am the root of all things ... There is no other Buddha besides Me, the All-Creating One."

"I am the core of all that exists. I am the seed of all that exists. I am the foundation of all that exists. I am the root of existence. I am 'the core', because I contain all phenomena. I am 'the seed', because I give birth to everything. I am 'the cause', because all comes forth from me. I am 'the trunk', because the ramificationsof every event sprout from me. I am 'the foundation', because all abides in me. I am called 'the root', because I am everything."

Sampa Lhundrup (Wish Fulfilling Prayer) is a powerful protection prayer written by Guru Rinpoche.

It is for example like a begger who uses a rock for a pillow, never dreaming that inside the rock is a precious diamond.

The descent of the wisdom vajra empowerment originally comes from the Mahāmudra chapter of the Jñan̄asiddhi written by Indrabhuti. Tai Situ's presentation is completely based on this. In fact, the whole Kagyu essence Mahamudra tradition uses this text to justify its approach.

However, the Jñan̄asiddhi still presents a gradual path. In the very next chapter after the Mahāmudra chapter in this text, Indrabhuti states:

"One whose yoga engages the mind
through the application
of gradual training becomes a buddha,
there is no other way to accomplish Buddhahood."

So, it is pretty clear that Mahāmudra in general is considered a gradual path.

However, in regards to so called Cigcarwas, those whose awakening is sudden, merely through an introduction -- an early Nyingma master of the twelfth century, Zhigpo Dudtsi remarked, "Apart from Saraha in India, and Lingje Repa (founder of Drugpa Kagyu), I have never heard of any other cigcarwas.

If that really is the case, it is sad, since it seems to indicate that Tibetan Buddhists who hold this view, live in their own separate bubble of misunderstandings. They need to break through this bubble and discover the real world.

Malcolm wrote:
I have read Theravadins who definitely hold what I would consider substantialist views. I have read Thervadins who do not. I find some Abhidhamma to be very substantialist in tone.

Mahāyāna bodhicitta does not exist for most Theravadins, and the narrow criteria for who can generate something resembling Mahāyāna style bodhicitta is so strict as to discourage anyone from trying (one reason, you see, why the Saddharmapundarika predicts everyone for full buddhahood as conceived by the authors of the Pundarika).

Kare said:
There once were schools - like the Sarvastivada and the Pudgalavada schools - that might be called substantialist (although I am not quite sure if that would be a correct description of them, either).

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, it is. They really do assert things really exist on some level or another -- atoms, moments, persons, etc. Early Buddhists went crazy with a proliferation of dharmas to explain everything, just as Mahayanists went crazy with cosmic narratives ala Puranas.

Kare said:
If those schools were denounced as substantialists by the Mahayana/Vajrayana - and subsequently called "Hinayana" - and if then afterwards a further misunderstanding led to Theravada being identified as "Hinayana", that might perhaps explain how such a bizarre view arose.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, in my opinion the distinction between Mahāyāna and Hināyāna really hinges on how vinaya was interpreted more than anything. Mahāyānists consistently maintain that intent is more important than the vow. That under certain circumstances a monastic could even kill a human being, lie about miraculous powers, etc. without losing his monastic vows. Mahāyānists felt that many monastics used their vows as an excuse to disengage from the world. There is element of "engaged" Buddhism in the formation of early Mahāyāna that has been overlooked. Of course, at the same time, there also trends in Mahāyāna that suggest withdrawing from the world.

Mahāyāna is not a coherent, monolithic entity either. This is perhaps the most important thing to recognize -- apart from distinct features common to all Mahāyāna schools, the development of Mahāyāna was not a rational evolution, the development of any system of thought with many contributing thinkers never is (including Theravada).

So called Modern Mahāyāna is basically a scholastic fabrication every bit as much as Modern Theravada is.

The fact is that circumstances on the ground are not so easy -- there used to be Mahāyāna Thervadins until they are were crushed in Shri Lanka. So, in general the main line of division is that all monastic orders belong to a so called "hināyāna" because their goal and intention is inferior and lower. The vows of monk are the essence of "hināyāna" because they are so restrictive. Theravadins, etc., thought it was scandalous that so called Mahāyāna bhiksus would freely handle gold, sometimes go to bars, and generally mix with the population. In some ways the monastic orders were too elite oriented and this created a vacuum where the populist Mahāyānis could easily fill. It is often easier to get your spiritual milk from the guy you drink beer with than a priest. This also explains the popularity of the siddha movement later on.

Mahāyāna was originally sub-altern movement that was bucking the monastic establishment while at the time trying to co-opt it. It also did not develop rationally, but was rationalized by later Mahāyānis once certain Mahāyāna trends were set as "establishment" and gained royal support post Nāgārjuna. Nāgārjuna's secured his place in history no so much because of what he wrote, but because of who his friends were (kings). This is the way of samsara.

Then Mahāyāna grew stale, abstract, irrelevant to needs of normal people and we have another sub-altern movement, anuttarayoga tantra (I exclude lower tantras because these were never sub-altern movements -- but from the beginning grew out of a need to parallel the replacement of brahmins in the burgeoning context of a growing Puranic culture for ritual needs of the aristocracy and commoners).

Finally, the Huns, then Hindu Kings, and finally Persian Moslems burnt, dismembered and interred Buddhism in its homeland over a period of 700 years.

We need to not forget that -- and we need to make sure our Buddhism, whatever it is, is as relevant to the beer drinker (without of course insisting that he give up his beer) as it is to a scholar.

And that is the most important thing to recall when conversing and discussing with our fellow Buddhists.

Troy existed  900 years before the Illiad and for 2600 hundred years all we knew of it was a story -- then someone tracked the story down and found a city buried where the story said it would be three thousand years later.

There certainly was a religion in Tibet we can call "Bon" prior to Buddhism. The first Tibetan king live circa 120 BCE. Prior to that there were many generations of Zhang Zhung kings. Zhang Zhung fell not because of Tibetan aggression -- the kingdom of Zhang Zhung failed because of overgrazing and climate change (for which there is both archaeological evidence and climate evidence).

Bon claims to had a transmission of Dzogchen, etc.,, independent of Shakyamuni Buddha and Garab Dorje's lineage according to their tradition coming from a teacher Shenrab Miwoche. They place the origin of Tonpa Shenrab in Western Central Asia.
This is reasonable since it is a certainty that the Zhang Zhung people migrated to the high plateau of western Tibet from somewhere else, most likely the west and they were not Tibetan, so did not come into Tibet through the low country in Kongpo like the early Tibetan tribes.

After the fall of Zhang Zhung, some Zhang Zhung people continued to migrate east into eastern Tibet and western China, settling in the border lands there. The Naxi people are among the remnants of this migration.

Some Zhang Zhung people stayed behind and moved south into the lower more fertile valleys around Kinnaur. There exists is a small population that continues to speak a descendent of Zhang Zhung language. In my opinion, because Tibetan became the dominant tongue in Western Tibet, the Zhang Zhung people lost their original grammar and thus the small Kinnauri population that speak "Zhang Zhung dialect" of Tibetan now speak a kind of colonial patois of Tibetan with many Zhang Zhung words.

The real facts are lost to history. But we can respect Yungdrung Bon as a fellow tradition that shares the ideals, goals, and essential doctrines of Buddhism. We also should respect Bon because it is important to Tibetan culture.

Did Bon borrow extensively from Buddhism? well, in my opinion, it is very likely. Does this matter? No. Does it matter if it can all be pinned down definitively? No. Do Bonpos attain liberation through Dzogchen teachings? Yes. That, in the end, is all that matters (if you are a Dzogchen practitioner).

Do people sometimes get confused about all this? Often. Is Buddhist behavior towards Bon often despicable? Yes.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes -- here is a general guideline for men. Though this has changed a bit with modern diet and availability of foods around the seasons from all over the world, there are still some trends we can observe -- when it is hot, we tend to eat much lighter and lighter, less nutritious food, and when it is cold, we eat heavier, oilier, more nutritious food. When people ate according to the cycle of the year, this was much more pronounced. Therefore, in the winter months, when it is cold and one is eating a lot of heavy food, one can ejaculate as much as five times a day with no health problem. As one moves through spring, this reduces to every two days, and finally in summer only every two weeks. When one starts to increase one's intake of nutritious foods in the fall through harvest and slaughter season (which happens in late fall in Tibet), then one can increase to every other day.

Now, if someone is depleted, they should not have sex because in this case, as in summer, one loses a little ojas with ejaculation. If one is healthy, winter time, eating well, etc., there is no danger of losing ojas because one has excess.

While women do not have the same issue -- menstruation can be a cause of depleting ojas if they are not careful with their diet.

Ojas is mainly depleted by stress. A lot of autoimmune disorders come from depleted ojas because of modern lifestyle.

I have read a little about Dzogchen. Only had one teaching on it from a qualified Lama, definitely not an expert though. What is the difference (if any) between pointing out instructions and what is called the "Mind to Mind transmission" found in Chan? Would be nice to get some answers from those who are knowledgeable in both traditions.


Malcolm wrote:
The basic difference is as follows. With Dzogchen, right in the very beginning your primordial state is pointed out to you with words, symbols and personal experience. You then work with this, integrating into this knowledge.

In Zen, you practice for many years, discover your real nature, awaken, and then your awakening is signed off on by an awakened master, someone who is capable of recognizing the experience you have had and verifying it for you.

So, completely different.

I should clarify that there are lots of different traditions of "pointing out". And the way "pointing out" is done in Dzogchen is very different than the way it is done in Mahāmudrā -- the latter is far more gradual, in general.

It is equally naive to pretend that Tibetans did not understand that these terms included Theravadins. You might want to argue Tibetans had very little experience with Theravadins. And this is so to an extent -- but Tibetans were not completely unaware of their neighbors, were aware of Burma (part of the region Tibetans call Mon yul which extends from Bhutan to roughly the Irrawady), etc. and were certainly aware of Nikāya/Agamic monks in India and their tenets.

But the thing is, the term nyan thos (śravaka) suffers not so well either in hands of Tibetan commentators being another catch phrase for "those who just don't get it".

I don't think you will ever get any Tibetan master to agree that the realization of an arhat is functionally equivalent to that of a Buddha. Just as you will not find any Sakya or Nyingmapa agreeing that common Mahāyān is capable of producing complete buddhahood either.

Theravadins are considered to be substantialist by Tibetan Buddhists.

In the end, the best we can do is agree on the basic principles of Buddha's teachings and leave it at that and try to collaborate despite our differences, since there are not many Buddhists in the world, and many in other religious and secular ideologies who would happily see Buddhism as a whole destroyed.

From a Mahāyāna point of view, rejecting Mahāyāna is exactly "turning to the lower" in exactly the same sense that it was used in Pali canon.

There is no question that in Tibetan Buddhism, all Nikāya tenet systems are regarded as inferior and flawed by substantialism of one kind or another, and the Nikayas/Agamas, incomplete and provisional.

In this instance I will follow the instructions of my teachers and disengage from this line of discussion.

So, we must disengage the State. The State, whether Capitalist or Socialist (two sides of same coin) is the source of all social ills. Revolutionary socialism of the 19th and 20th century was a movement of people without power speaking truth to power. When socialists took power, they immediately became corrupted by the very power they previously had been struggling with. Capital, in the deformed "socialist" states, was position and status. But in the end, States are engines of commerce and so it is that the great Socialist experiments begun in the late nineteenth centuries and early twentieth centuries ended in disaster, famine, and general slaughter, of tens of millions of innocents. The fault lies not with the basic ideals of Socialism, the fault lies within the apparatus of industrial society and the State that supports it. The blind spot of socialism is this idea that they could use the tools of the oppression of common people i.el factories, et al, to free themselves, when in fact, the whole industrial mode of production simply enslaves human beings.

Things like qualities of food are explained very well in Ayurveda and so on. He was unlikely to have had much exposure to the Four Tantras tradition of Tibetan Medicine, because at that point is was still a family lineage in the Yuthok clan. He was a little younger than Yuthok. Tibetan Medicine originally was very secret, and is connected with Dzogchen as well. But like any educated Lama of his day, he certainly had access to various medical traditions and chulen traditions coming from India like the Amrita siddhi tradition.

No, living off the essence of vāyu is dharmakāya chulen. I.e. you are taking the pure five elements directly from breath.

Chulen of space is what we are taking about since space is the basis of the other four elements. It means the same thing. But in order to so this in a pure way one must build up through nirmanakāya and sambhogakāya chulen, respectively eating a sattvic diet combined with pills, in the second eating only pills, and perhaps flowers -- there are variations.

This chulen of space is the an important supporting condition of body of light realization.

Any, as you know there are four stages of bliss i.e. the three relative bliss — bliss, supreme bliss, the bliss of being free of bliss; and beyond all, innate bliss. And these four get divided up in sixteen etc., since there is a relationship with the sixteen moments of the path of seeing.

The trio of bliss, clarity and non-conceptuality are experiences that need to be recognized so that they do not serve as a basis for deviation.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, that is correct. Actually, there is more to it than that. Ojas is the final product of digesting food. So, for this reason one needs to periodically do cleanses, and engage in the practice of rasāyana. This is more effective than mere celibacy because you are cleansing the digestive channels and tract, increasing your ability to absorb rasa, the broken down food, and then having a fairly pure diet where one is mainly relying on essence foods such as ghee and honey, with a sattvic diet.

The whole point of Ayurveda and Tibetan Medicine is to refine and purify ojas in the body for longevity etc. In Tibetan the term ojas is translated as "mdangs".

Again, to restate, when we are doing deity yoga, our bodies are conceived to be hollow -- thus we visualize the channels in various ways depending on what system we are practicing. Hence, according Menpa Tenzin, et al, our visualization does not correspond with the manner in which the three channels actually exist in the body, and more importantly, it does not need to.

The reasons behind this again become very clear when one studies embryology according to Tibetan Medicine, Kalacakra, or Dzogchen Nyinthig. A very good book on this subject has been published by Francis Garret.

adinatha said:
That was very clear and descriptive. Thank you. I'm very interested in the highlighted portion. Can you please explain that just a bit more. Why do our visualizations not need to correspond to the way these actual exist in the body?

Malcolm wrote:
Well, it is because our visualization of our bodies as deities also does not correspond to our bodies in a real sense either. For example, when we visualize ourselves as Vajrasattva, in Vajrasattvas body there is no heart, no lungs, no liver, spleen/pancreas or kidney, no stomach, intestines, gall bladder, urinary bladder, ovaries or seminal vesicle, etc.

We primarily use the three channels as a visualization guide for the prāṇa vāyu in our bodies that we breath in. For example, we use the visualization of the lower ends of the three channels to focus our attention below the belly, for example -- through muscular contraction of the mulabandha and the uddiyāna bandhas we collect and force vāyu into arterial system and cause it to supersaturate our cells, capillaries, etc. with vāyu and ojas (the real bodhicitta element within our body) that it pumps. Simultaneously, our heart rate slows, and this means for a time not only is our consciousness "slowing down" i.e. because the karma vāyus are now suspended, but the venous blood is returning less impurities into the blood stream temporarily while the ojas is flushing and restoring the cells. This is why Khumbaka, for example, is the hidden secret to longevity in both Hatha Yoga of the Nathas, and in Vajrayāna. Through the two lower locks, we slow blood flow into the vena cava, saturate blood with prāṇa vāyu and send it into the arteries, etc. Ojas itself has two stores within the body -- the heart and also the brain. This is why we do the visualization of blazing and dripping, etc.

This is just a rough approximation.

Hi Namdrol,

If one is visualizing the channels incorrectly, then is this not a problem?  Would this be an issue that would affect one's practice?

Malcolm wrote:
In Sakya, for example, they place great emphasis on visualizing the channels very precisely. In Dzogchen, according to the Khandro Nyinthig, it is enough to have an idea of the channels. The same is true for deity yoga and the same difference applies.

However, you must apply the method of the system you are practicing. So for example, of you are practicing Naro Khachö it is considered very important to have a very precise visualization, very clear, very vivid. You apply the method of the school which you are following at any given time for any given practice.

1. All prior scriptures are not first person buddha perspective; they are deluded perspective. 2. I can't violate any samaya, because I have no samaya to keep, other than the nature of mind which is impossible to break. I'm talking about the Apex, not some method or routine from the standpoint of a someone with distorted vision. I'm sorry if I sound gruff: I don't want the inner secret to be lost or diluted. Total freedom is a right, but still a right one has to earn by letting everything go, even dharma.

Malcolm wrote:
Longchepa also writes in the Ocean of Liberation from the Lama Yangthig:

"Now then, although there is nothing to damage or transgress, the natural great perfection being beyond a boundary to protect, since it is necessary for yogins on the path of practice to abide in commitments, in order to purify one’s continuum there are the three root commitments.There are twenty five branch commitments as well i.e. what to understand, what not to avoid,what to adopt, how to act, what to accomplish which are taught in the great tantras. The branch comittments are taught as mere assistants for protecting the root commitments since they possess accepting and rejecting, effort and practice."

This itself is a commentary on the more elaborate commentary concerning Dzogchen samaya in the Vima sNying thig, the Analysis of Samaya. It says:

"If one dwells in the samayas of the body, it will not be difficult to obtain the unchanging body vajra of all the buddas. If one dwells in the samayas of the voice, it will not be difficult to obtain the unchanging speech vajra of all the buddas. If one dwells in the samayas of the mind, it will not be difficult to obtain the unchanging mind vajra of all the buddas."

As for Greg's point, Longchenpa here states that among the 27 root commitments (9*3):

"The outer of the inner [is not to ridicule] speaking the words of the teachings..."

This certainly means that while one may not find a given passage relevant to one's own condition, one should not hubristically dismiss the teachings of the Buddha as if they are as you put it "...from a deluded perspective." All Buddhist teachings are for deluded people, yes, even all Dzogchen texts. From that perspective, even Dzogchen tantras are from a deluded perspective. This is not to say of course there are not teachings for people of greater and lesser delusion. This is not to say that we need to follow Nikaya teachings as if they are of the same value as Dzogchen teachings, etc. But that depends on the practitioner. If someone does not have transmission, than all Dzogchen texts are meaningless aside from being used as bhakti objects.

Undeluded people do not need teachings of any kind. They also are in great or total samaya, always. total samaya is just another word for "dzogchen", mahāsaṃdhi or santimāha in the lanuage of Oḍḍiyāna.

Something doesn't make sense to me. What is a channel exactly? Air goes into the lungs, the oxygen is taken into blood stream. The yogic method of channels and winds uses channels that are not lungs or blood vessels. How the three channels meet at the base of the body is not connected to a cavity or passage where gas could travel.

Malcolm wrote:
A channel is a channel: veins, arteries and nerves. You can add to this the lymphatic system, though they are considered to act as a support for bring moisture to the nervous system among their other functions.

A cakra in this view is any place in the body where there are clusters of arteries, veins and nerves. You can readily see five such clusters in the body. There are many more.

The channels we visualize are just a method -- why? because when we are visualizing ourselves as a deity, we visualize our bodies as completely hollow, made of light, with no internal organs.

The explicitly stated point of view of Tibetan Medicine is that the avadhūtī is all channels of air i.e. arteries; the rasanā is all channels of fire i.e. the blood vessels, and the lalanā all channels of water i.e. the nerves in the body. This is detailed at length by Zurkhar Lodo Gyalpo, is based primarily on the understanding of the anatomy of the body indicated by the Third Karmapa in his Zabmo Nangdon and reinforced by Desrid Sangye Gyatso. The latter two were both great Dzogchen masters as well though, Zurkharwa was not.

For example, the Kagyu Historian, Thubten Phunstog, has written an interesting commentaries on Tibetan Medicine, Six Yogas of Naropa, and well as Zabmo Nangdon. He makes the case that if channels are not physical structures in the body, then practices like gtum mo would have no effect. Then there is the very interesting doctor in Golok, Menpa Tenzin, who wrote a book based on doing many years of dissection of cadavers which contain very detailed drawings of his research. One may think this unnecessary given Netter's Anatomy and so on, but it is interesting -- and his dissections were guided from a Tibetan Medical perspective. He really explained this principle to us very well when we are interning in Xining. He is a disciple of Khenpo Munsel and In Tibet, he is a well respected Dzogchen master.

In reality, the three channels meet in each of these five (or six) locations in the body, according to the presentation I gave above from Kalackara.

The reasons behind this again become very clear when one studies embryology according to Tibetan Medicine, Kalacakra, or Dzogchen Nyinthig. A very good book on this subject has been published by Francis Garret.

However, again, in the West, our idea of ṇāḍis has been very influenced by the acupuncture idea of "meridians" as well as Hindu ideas of cakras and ṇāḍis. The Upanishadic idea of cakras and ṇāḍis is related to the concept of pañcakośa originating in the Taittiriya Upanisha  (which makes this idea a bit older than the Buddha's teaching), where they are explicitly connected with the prāṇamayakośa. On the other hand, the Upanishads are very important to understand, because they contain many ideas and concepts which reappear in altered form (i.e. revised in accordance with Buddha ideas) in Vajrayāna, Ayurveda/Tibetan Medicine, and even in Dzogchen.

Tsang Nyong Heruka's bio of Mila is an inspired piece of historical fiction based on the many oral traditions he collected travelling all over the Himalayan regions where Milarepa wandered. While I have no doubt that Mila adopted the Tsheringma sisters as guardians since the presence of the five Tseringma sisters as guardians in the Kagyu school is well attested, I don't see any reason to accept Tsang Nyon's narratives at face value.

Further, the permission ritual of Tseringma in the Kagyu sNgags mDzod clearly explains how Padmasambhava bound Tseringma under the secret name "Vajrasamantabhadri", and later how in particular Tseringma was made a specific guardian of Kagyu school by Milarepa.

As I read the account given in this permission ritual, Tseringma was testing Milarepa's yogic ability.

Finally, there is no contradiction between stating, for example, "...among non-human disciples, Tseringma was Milarepa's chief student" and understanding that the twelve tenma were Dzogchen guardians from the beginning.

Generally, however, for Dzogchen, among the twelve Tenma, Dorje Yudronma is regarded as more important. For the Kagyus, Tseringma is more important.

It is inconsistent to say that the five elements function at the macro level of matter and are irrelevant at the subatomic level. The five elements are properties of all matter, period. The medicine tantra states:

"No formation without earth, no cohesion without water, no maturation without fire, no development without air, and no room for development without space."

I will answer myself and refute you. Solidity in matter is an illusion caused by the spinning an electron, which creates an energetic cloud, and thus the mere appearance of solidity. There is no solidity in fact. It is just a charge. A charge is just a positive or negative. An electron is not technically a particle. So there is no atomic solidity.

At the level of subatomic particles, the are spins and lower than that waves. Not a wave in the motion sense. But a wave in the geometric sense. One can never detect motion and position simultaneously at this level.  Again, no solidity. There is also no mass. Quantum people have no idea what accounts for mass. All they have are mathematical models.

Without motion, solidity or mass, the whole phenomenal world collapses. So there is certainly no possibility of observing liquidity, gaseousness or heat. At this level even space is not space. It all converges with information: constants and probabilities.

What does remain are charges: Positive (attracting), negative (repelling) and neither (neutral). These do have a correspondence with the three poisons. To my satisfaction, this here provides perfect explanatory and experiential understanding of why consciousness arises as an interdependence of these three things, why there is no such thing as a universal consciousness, and why there is liberation.

Malcolm wrote:
The five elements are inherent in consciousness; consciousness is inherent in the five elements. There are no levels of subatomic anything which exist outside the sadadhātu, consciousness, space, air, fire, water and earth.

If you want to go further, we could discuss how these gross expressions of the sadadhātu have their corollaries in terms of wisdom and the five lights.

Now you can see that even the subatomic level must have the five elements in order to be material, physical (rūpena).

Your claim that the inner winds are the same as the outer winds has not been borne out, despite various lines of argument. That is my contention.

Malcolm wrote:
My claim is that the winds in the body are based on the process of respiration. I never asserted that they do not undergo change and refinement in the body, of course they do. The function of the lungs is to bring air into body and pass it into the channels, refining it along the way. This vāyu, like any other of the four elements that are taken up by the body, undergoes a process of digestion. Breath is a kind of food. This is why we have rasāyanas of air, which involve prāṇayāma practices to extract the rasa of the vāyu directly and so on.

Anyway, this understanding comes from Tibetan Medicine. For example, one of my teachers, Tamdrin Gyal from Amdo, when explaining topics from Rangjung Dorje's famed Zabmo Nangdon to us asserted that while the vāyu/vatta of the body comes from external element of air conducted into the body through breathing, the air element outside the of body does not possess all seven characteristics of vāyu present in the body i.e, rough, light, cold, motile, subtle and hard.

When we talk about the five elements in the body, we always refer to them as the five refined elements. But, for example, Padmsambhava is very clear that the five refined elements in the body come from the five gross elements upon which we depend for life.

The meaning of prāṇa is "life". If there life in the sun?

The Vajramālā states very plainly:

The characteristic of the the element of air (vāyu)
is the vāyu (air) pervading the six cakras,
always present in the dharmacakra,
called prāṇa since it pervades migrating beings"

And:

The wheel of vāyu is explained to be prāṇa.

And apropos of the Kalacakra citation in the last post it states:

Depending on upper or lower,
the major vāyus, prāṇa and apana are located.

Prāṇa vāyu is furthere defined in this text:

From the traces of the all-basis consciousness
arises the stream of consciousness;
the affliction [consciousness] is the prāṇa vāyu.

cloudburst said:
So the Kalachakra Tantra explains that when you fart, you expel your downward-voiding wind? Would you care to cite a few lines?

Also, I can see how you may have misunderstood my question above. I was asking... since ejaculation (and of course urination etc) are caused by the dvw, what are you proposing in these cases? In the case of flatulence, you explain that the dvw moves downward and leaves the body. What is your proposition with respect to any of the other eliminations through lower doors, as they are not composed of air?

Of course they "happen becasue of the" dvw, but your claim that the dvw is actually the air that moves when we are flatulent is a misleading example as it does not mapo on to any other function of the dvw. My question is: how to explain in the case of movement that is not physical air, but rather liquid, etc.

Malcolm wrote:
We are not communicating well.

That flatus is the downward voiding wind is a fact. The apana-vāyu is also responsible for moving liquids out of the body such as sperm, urine and so forth, as well as solids such as feces. It's location in the body is the pelvic region.

There is a passage in the Kalacakra that describes the anus as being the lower end of the central channel. The famous Doctor Zurkar Lodo Gyalpo explains the following in his "Oral Advice of the Grandfathers",  his commentary on the formation of the body chapter in the Explanatory Medicine Tantra

This verse (from the Explanatory Tantra) "The channels of formation divide into three from the navel" demonstrates the lalanā, rasanā and the lower end of the avadhūtī. The channel that creates kapha, etc., is the lalanā through which the element of water moves. The channel that creates blood and so on is the rasanā through which the element of fire moves. The channel that creates vāyu and so on is the lower part of the avadhūti. The lower ends of the rasanā and lalanā are demonstrated through implication. These three tips both below and above the navel are applied according to the intention of the Shri Kalacakra i.e. the Adibuddha states:

Those have three tips below,
likewise, three tips above. 
The tip of Rahu is present in the center,
the tip of Surya is on the right,
the tip of Candra is on the left. 
The vāyus of water, fire and space
move feces, urine, and sukra
through the bottom of the right, left, and central [channels].
The channels interlaced like a chain
are the three pathways of the prāṇa and the apaṇa.

The great commentary states "In terms of the the so called 'channel interlaced into a chain which runs to the location of amrita', the amritaṇāḍī is in forehead. "Moving there" is moving into the location of amrita i.e. the lalanā, the rasanā, and the avadhūtī. Since those are interlaced like a chain, having made three pathways between the navel and the heart, once again they intersect in the center of the heart in the center of the avadhūtī. The lalanā and the rasanā move to the right and left sides. After that, between the heart and the throat, they make three paths. In the same way they are three paths between the throat and the forehead, and likewise between the forehead and crown. Having made three paths four times, the lalanā ends in twelve different locations other from the left nostril. The rasanā from the right (nostril). The avadhūtī leaves simultaneously from both nostrils. Likewise, having made three paths below the navel and again below the secret cakra, between feces and urine moving from the right and the left, and in the center of the secret lotus there is the conch nāḍī. Below the conch nāḍī, the mahāmalā (great waste i.e. rectum) channel moves from the center. From penis or the vagina, the urine channel moves from the left, and the seminal channelfrom right."


Incidentally, in the Blue Beryl, Desri Sangye Gyatso reproduces the above passage more or less in its entirety without comment.

I should think the meaning of all of this is rather clear.

There are three vāyus that are subsets of the apana vāyu. The apāna vāyu in general governs the lower ends of the three channels. The three lower channels are the rectum i.e. the lower end of the central channel; the urinary tract i.e. the lower end of the lalanā, and the channel which emits semen or ovum i..e the lower end of the rasanā channel.

When someone has an excess of apana vāyu, they fart, or have diarrhea, etc. There are many disorders they have have connected with the three lower passages. We take wind in, some of it is expelled from the lower end of the body as flatus.

However, I will allow that my understanding of many tantric topics has been altered considerably through my studies of Tibetan medicine.

Not sure about the prana source being only breath.  That would mean a deep samadhi state where breath stops, could not last that long - but it does - many hours, days & beyond.  Since prana pervades the atmosphere around us, that prana is somehow absorbed during samadhi, without the lungs functioning.

Malcolm wrote:

There is no prāṇa as a separate entity. This is a huge misconception. There is a prāṇa vāyu i.e. the breath we inhale.

As far not breathing during certain states of samadhi -- during these state the respiration is so slight it is not noticed. It is still happening however.

I have always found that wind, fire, water and earth are confusing terms. I prefer motility, temperature, liquidity and solidity. These are retained by basic physics and tend to make the yogic practices jibe with modern understandings. Furthermore, going beyond these gross elements are the subtle "elements" of the sub-atomic world, those would be attraction, repulsion and neutrality (space). I have found these to be extremely apropos, because the three poisons of samsara are attachment, aversion and ignorance. I feel these are a perfect correspondence. Thus, in the realization of Atiyoga or Mahamudra, when grasping has ceased by recognition of the nature of basic space dharmadhatu, attachment and aversion have ceased; thus, the basic cause of matter, that is, attraction, repulsion and deluded space are unbound. Because dharmadhatu has qualities deluded ordinary space does not, there are the three kayas and the body, speech and mind of buddha.


Malcolm wrote:
Earth, air fire and water in one sense refer to the three states of matter with the presence or absence of heat being responsible for phase transition between states.

This replicates down no matter how far you go in physical reality.

But for our purposes, for example, discussing pranayāma and other such issues -- it obvious that vāyu is a name for the air that we are breathing in.

Basic space, incidentally, is a very bad rendering of dharmadhātu, and is not supported by commentaries.

Malcolm wrote:
There are five elements: earth, water, fire, air and space -- they are material, whether coarse or subtle.

When transmigration happens at the time of death, the mind/wind leaves specific orifices of the body, or channel openings. This would bot be necessary if the wind upon which the mind is mounted was not itself physical and material.

For example, when you have flatulence, this comes from the apana vāyu, the downward-voiding wind. That flatus is apana-vāyu.

Vāyu in the body is coarse or subtle depending upon how much it is moving. But it is still something physical, part of the rūpa skandha.

If you cannot accept this explanation, then you have to invent terms that do not exist in the original Tibetan and Sanskrit texts, such as the Vajramālā tantra that explain things like vāyus and so on.

I prefer to not to interpolate new age ideas onto Vajrayāna. So, I accept that vāyu in the body comes from the breath. If you think about it long enough, you will understand that I am correct. You need to study tantric embryology. When you do, this will make more sense to you.

I've had five clear visions beginning with my first memory. I have always had a nonstop fascination with crazy yogi sadhus and an aspiration to be one. Before I met any Dzogchen teachers I found the Seven Line Prayer and instantly started reciting it and felt intense natural rigpa blaze. Friends like Tony Duff helped me out with texts and deepened my experience. Yogini Changchub Palmo, student of Chatral Rinpoche, gave me a lot of affirmation. Over the years I've spent thousands of hours on listening and re-listening to ChNN. I've wondered if that Ati master is coming or what? Then, I'm also the "heart-son" to a Drikung lama, and that makes the situation weirder. Then I practice Dzogchen dedicatedly. I can't help it. I had a clear dream recently after practicing Togal similar to one KDL describes with a message from Ekajati. I received Tigle Gyachen without a reading transmission and definitely powerful blessings and I started to see signs in my dreams too. I'm puzzled by this. I feel Ekajati is throwing me blessings. The only connection I can make is that my family lineage ancestral homeland is the area that would now be considered Swat and all that surrounds it. My family heritage is that we were the kings of the land. The Puru. The Puru are the oldest living family lineage on the planet. It goes back 5000 years so I don't know. There's actually a Wikipedia article about it. I have no idea who wrote it. I know from family we have an intensely spiritual history, that includes Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs. There must be a past life connection somewhere. I want you to know that for me Ekajati is a teacher; at least I feel it if I'm doing something wrong by Ati. I physically will feel sick. It's like a barometer. What I'm saying here is from my heart of hearts. No bullshit. That's where I'm at. I'm gauging.

So the coarse freedom from grasping of sutra becomes progressively more subtle.

It seems to me that the freedom from grasping explained in sutra becomes more subtle as the energy winds supporting the view gather and are pacified, so perhaps clear light and Dzogchen view differ in presentation only.

Namdrol said:
What I meant was that freedom from grasping is progressively more and more subtle as one moves through the practices of the nine yānas.

No need to add "energy" to winds. The composition of vāyus is vāyu, the element of air. We term them "winds" in English because they move through the channels of body. Wind is moving air -- no movement, no wind.

N

cloudburst said:
so dzogchen view is sutra view of freedom from grasping made more and more subtle as one moves through the yanas. This is description also aptly describes the mind of clear light.

the purpose in adding "energy" to winds is to differentiate "moving air" from moving energy. If you already understand this, there is as you say no need for this term. There is however no fault in adding it for purposes of clarity.

Malcolm wrote:
I guess I am not explaining this clearly: dzogchen view is the ultimate freedom from grasping, quite beyond sūtra.

The only difference between wind in your body and wind outside your body is that it is in your body. There is no "energy" apart from vāyu. There are ten vāyus. The less those vāyus move in the body, the more subtle the mind becomes.

I don't think adding the term "energvy" makes the concept about what is happening in the human body any clearer, and rather more muddled.
