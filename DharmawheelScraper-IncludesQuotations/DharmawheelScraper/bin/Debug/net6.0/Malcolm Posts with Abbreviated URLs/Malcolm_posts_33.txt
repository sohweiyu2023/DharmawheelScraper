Gyalpo are one of the 8 classes of very powerful beings and are much more closely related to the beings of the higher realms than the lower.
They have little in common with preta other than being generally unseen sentient beings.

The eight classes, or at least most of them, are classified as pretas that move through space in WOMPT. But as one of the eight classes is devas I suppose these are actually devas and not pretas, and perhaps this is true for 1-2 others.

He/She wanted to use the women's bathroom and the employer didn't want to permit it. This was twenty or so years ago before all this gender stuff became what it is now. The dispute ended up in binding arbitration, as required for almost all disputes arising under a collective bargaining agreement. The arbitrator himself was a grizzled old fella who had been in the trucking industry since Jimmy Hoffa was alive. The sides made their opening statements and then the arbitrator looked at the foreman and asked, "Do you stand or sit?"

The foreman wasn't expecting the question and stammered, "I stand."

The arbitrator said, "You use the men's bathroom."

manhood is a social construction.  it's built up in different ways in different contexts, and all of them are full of contradictions.

Their realization differed because their view differed. From the perspective of Candrakīrti, for example, Yogacāra practice does not lead to the path of seeing. This was contested by Yogacārins, naturally.

If we examine the texts of the respective systems, we can see that the standard division of Madhyamaka and Yogacāra as deep and vast is grounded in reality.

Madhyamaka focuses on the profound view, whereas, Yogacāra focuses on a detailed explanation of the bodhisattva path. There is no difference in practice, but there is a difference in view. The de facto Indian position (while not entirely uncontested) is that Madhyamaka and the Perfection of Wisdom Sūtras are the summum bonum of Mahāyāna teachings.

Its ambiguous. 印 (seal; trace; mark; sign; imprint) has two radicals, 爪 (a hand) & 卩 (a kneeling man). This could potentially point to dharmamudrā at least in as much as folk linguistics has a tendency to point to much.

But 法印 (dharma seal) can also have come from dharmoddāna still. The DDB (is this a working link for everyone?) has 印 as a semantic variant of 優檀那 (ʔɨu dɑn nɑ), which in turn is a phonetic transcription of the Sanskrit uddāna. Mind you, this reading seems only attested in a traditional Chinese-Sanskrit dictionary preserved at the end of the Taishō collection (T 2131 ).

what do you think of his use of the word "mythological" in this context since the Bhagawat Himself has spoken about and to nagas in the sutras? if nagas are mythological, then are brahma, indra, mahadev mythological? what about yakshas, rakshasas, kimnaras, kumbhandas, and gandharvas? and how about mahoragas and sa-dag/lords of the earth?

I can reproduce the relevant parts from the dictionary entry:

[From DDB:] The three marks of the law. Three aspects of the Buddhist teaching that clearly distinguish it from non-Buddhist teachings: all things are impermanent 諸行無常, all things lack inherent existence (no-self) 諸法無我, and that nirvāṇa is perfect quiescence 涅槃寂靜. 〔法華經 T 262.9.15b7〕 Also written 三印 (Skt. tri-dṛṣṭi-namitta-mudrā; Tib. phyag rgya gsum). [Charles Muller; source(s): YBh-Ind]

[If anyone has trouble accessing DDB, you just type 'guest' into the first line of the window that pops up and then hit enter.]

I don't know if 'Yhb-Ind' is a citation of a manuscript or something, or a scholarly work of some sort. The Taishō citation they give just links to the Chinese text. If indeed it was a reconstruction, I think it would have been nice for the dictionary compilers to try to mark it with at least an *asterisk.

Malcolm wrote:
The term phyag rgya gsum does indeed appear in Tibetan dictionaries, but in the bstan 'gyur it is a very rare term, showing up in only four texts, one of those the Korean commentary mentioned already (apart from  Tantric texts where the term means something else). The term shows up in the bka' 'gyur, but again, here it does not refer to the formula "all formations," etc.

Our lack of awareness of it does not mean it does not exist anymore.

Dependent origination is just "Because this exists, that exists, with the arising of that, this arose."


Grigoris said:
I am happy to accept that teachings on dependent origination are the Dharma, since the Buddha said, "Whoever sees dependent origination sees the Dharma, whoever sees the Dharma sees dependent origination." [M.I.190] But if you claim the Dharma is eternal, you will claim that dependent origination is eternal.
If we both agree that samsara is infinite, then you will have to agree that dependent origination functions infinitely too.  Infinite and eternal being synonyms...

Malcolm wrote:
I agree that conditioned phenomena have no beginning. The term "dependent origination" is just a word we use to describe "arising from conditions."

Further, knowing dependent origination does not necessarily lead to liberation. That is why we need the Dharma, to explain how insight into dependent origination leads to the pacification of proliferation that characterizes nirvana or peace.

Grigoris said:
Likewise, at S.III.120, the Buddha says, "Whoever sees the Dharma sees the Buddha, whoever sees the Buddha sees the Dharma." Clearly, the Buddha is not eternal according to these sources, so claiming based on Pali sources that the Dharma or the Buddha is eternal is not going to fly.
If you believe he is speaking in reference to the Nirmanakaya and not the Dharmakaya then yes, it is not going to fly.

Malcolm wrote:
The Theravada concept of Dhammakāya is the qualities of the Buddha, such as the ten powers and so on. But it is no more permanent than the Buddha. No buddha, no qualities.

Even in Mahāyāna, dharmakāya is not a thing, per se.

A minute ago you were arguing that the Dharma expopunded by the Buddha was based on his training in the stages under past Buddhas and now you say that realisation disappears with the dissolution of this particular combination of name and form.  Make up your mind.

Malcolm wrote:
There is no contradiction. The Dharma of past Buddhas no longer exists, as least not in any complete form. What we know of the Dharma of past Buddhas comes from this Buddha.

Do you mean return your sacramental vows? If so, youd have to go to your parish where they baptized you (I think or any church) and fill out paper work to debaptize you.

No, i was talking about the christian mark, "empowerment", "initiation", (don't know how to call it but baptism), not to the papers related to it, which is something very different.

Yes, it is. It refers to Udraka Rāmaputra and Ālāra Kalama.

Grigoris said:
Like I said:  unlike Mahayana where the Buddha was already a Buddha before his appearance in this world, in Theravada he was a Bodhisattva up until the point where he sat under the bodhi tree and achieved enlightenment (but now I am repeating myself).

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, this is well known.


Grigoris said:
He does mention recollection of his past lives in MN 4, but he makes no mention of his knowledge arising from teachings he received from other Buddhas.  So I fail to see why you mention the particular Sutta as it is not really evidence against the notion that Dharma is eternal ie it does not contradict my interpretation of SN 12.65.

Malcolm wrote:
Eternal things do not disappear, but conditioned things with parts, for example, the Dharma, do:

"That's the way it is, Kassapa. When beings are degenerating and the true Dhamma is disappearing, there are more training rules and yet fewer monks established in final gnosis. There is no disappearance of the true Dhamma as long as a counterfeit of the true Dhamma has not arisen in the world, but there is the disappearance of the true Dhamma when a counterfeit of the true Dhamma has arisen in the world. Just as there is no disappearance of gold as long as a counterfeit of gold has not arisen in the world, but there is the disappearance of gold when a counterfeit of gold has arisen in the world, in the same way there is no disappearance of the true Dhamma as long as a counterfeit of the true Dhamma has not arisen in the world, but there is the disappearance of the true Dhamma when a counterfeit of the true Dhamma has arisen in the world

https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitak ... .than.html

There are many things which lead to the perishing of the Dharma, Christopher Titmus lists a number of sources concerning this here:

https://www.christophertitmussblog.org/ ... the-buddha

Dependent origination is simply, Where is arose, that arose; with the arising of that, this arises."  If you assert the Dharma is dependent origination, then you will are asserting a impermanent, conditioned thing as the Dharma in contradiction to your claim. I am happy to accept that teachings on dependent origination are the Dharma, since the Buddha said, "Whoever sees dependent origination sees the Dharma, whoever sees the Dharma sees dependent origination." [M.I.190] But if you claim the Dharma is eternal, you will claim that dependent origination is eternal.

Likewise, at S.III.120, the Buddha says, "Whoever sees the Dharma sees the Buddha, whoever sees the Buddha sees the Dharma." Clearly, the Buddha is not eternal according to these sources, so claiming based on Pali sources that the Dharma or the Buddha is eternal is not going to fly.

Beyond that, only two kinds of Dharma are defined the texts we have-- scripture and realization. Since texts and oral traditions vanish, and realized people die; both are impermanent. Thus, defining a third Dharma which is permanent or eternal is novel and without textual basis.

Malcolm wrote:
Hinayāna scriptures do not talk about the four "seals" at all. They do have a regular list of three itemse which excludes nirvana:

All formations ('du byed, samskara) are impermanent.
All formations are suffering.
All phenomena lack a self.

In its earliest usage in Mahāyāna Sūtras, the so called "four seals" were termed the four summaries of the Dharma ( chos kyi mdo bzhi ), and took the following form:

All formations are impermanent.
All formations are suffering.
All phenomena lack a self.
Nirvana is peaceful.

The term the "four seals" comes from the Korean Master Won Chuk's commentary on the Samdhinirmocana Sūtra. He identifies several sources for them, but specifically, the Mahāyānasutrālaṃkāra is the source for the term phyag rgya. However the term "seal" is not a direct translation, and in my opinion has lead to some confusion.

The term dharmoddānacatuṣṭayaṃ was translated into Chinese, from there into Tibetan as chos kyi phyag rgya bzhi in Wong Chuk's treatise. When translated directly from Sanskrit to Tibetan, it is chos kyi sdom ni rnam pa bzhi, i.e. the four constraints of the Dharma.

In reality, we have two terms used in Mahāyāna texts: 1) the four summaries of the Dharma and the four constraints of the Dharma, that latter coming from Mahāyānasutrālaṃkāra.

In my opinion, the term "four constraints" is more useful than "four seals," 1) because it shows us not how this or that teaching should be authenticated as a Dharma teachings with some seal of imprimatur, but rather, within what constraints a Dharma teaching should fall. 2) "Constraint" more accurately reflects the underlying original meaning of the term uddāna because it is derived from Sanskrit-->English, rather than the Sanskrit-->Chinese-->Tibetan-->English. Also, constraint/restraint is a widely accepted usage for translating the term sdom pa in this context.

Going forward, I suggest that we drop the usage "four seals of the Dharma" since it is misleading and not accurate.

Finally, in some presentations the second constraint is listed as "All that is contaminated is suffering," but surprisingly, it is very uncommon in this list which is mentioned through out Mahāyāna sūtras in many places. The reading above is the most common in the Sūtras. In one or two places you see "empty" attached to the third constraint, as in "All phenomena are empty and without a self."

I saw an ancient city, an ancient capital... complete with parks, groves, & ponds, walled, delightful. Sire, rebuild that city!' The king or king's minister would rebuild the city, so that at a later date the city would become powerful, rich, & well-populated, fully grown & prosperous.

"In the same way I saw an ancient path, an ancient road, traveled by the Rightly Self-awakened Ones of former times. And what is that ancient path, that ancient road, traveled by the Rightly Self-awakened Ones of former times? Just this noble eightfold path: right view, right resolve, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration... I followed that path. Following it, I came to direct knowledge of birth... becoming... clinging... craving... feeling... contact... the six sense media... name-&-form... consciousness, direct knowledge of the origination of consciousness, direct knowledge of the cessation of consciousness, direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of consciousness. I followed that path.

"Following it, I came to direct knowledge of fabrications, direct knowledge of the origination of fabrications, direct knowledge of the cessation of fabrications, direct knowledge of the path leading to the cessation of fabrications. Knowing that directly, I have revealed it to monks, nuns, male lay followers & female lay followers, so that this holy life has become powerful, rich, detailed, well-populated, wide-spread, proclaimed among celestial & human beings."

In any case, there are in addition to the Sutras already cited, other texts and teachings which speak about anything being timeless or actually eternal would then be unable to change. Seems to me that would apply to Dharma which at least outwardly has adapted to many cultures and times over the centuries.

But of course, they are still a Buddhist school.

Then we have teachers who teach a Dharma everyone approves of, guys like Sogyal, who seem unstoppable in their ability to actually harm others with impunity.

Just for reference, the Tathāgata's Inconcievable Secret Sūtra ( ārya-tathāgata-acintya-guhya-nirdeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra ) states the purpose of four is as follows:

Guhyapati, the Tathagāta has summarized all Dharmas, presenting the summary of Dharmas as four-fold. What are the four? In order to destroy the idea of permanence in bhikṣus and brahmins who advocate eternalism, and the long-lived devas, it is said, "All formations are impermanent." In order destroy the idea of happiness in devas and humans, it is said, "All formations are suffering." In order to destroy the non-Buddhist assertion of self, it is said, "All phenomena lack self." In order to destroy the strong pride of those engaged in conceptuality, it is said, "Nirvana is peace."

There are many places in sūtras and tantras where these four are discussed. But I think this is one of the best presentations because it shows the four summaries very clearly.

Malcolm wrote:
It never states in any sūtra or tantra for that matter, that the Dharma, the teaching of the Buddha, is permanent. Maitreyanatha in fact states just the opposite of your opinion.

Confusing dharmatā, etc., with the Dharma is confusing something unconditioned with something conditioned. But since one cannot establish the unconditioned since it never existed, it also makes no sense to claim that unconditioned dharmatā is some sort of stable refuge. Unconditioned dharmatā is just a name for the emptiness of conditioned, impermanent phenomena, and without that latter, there is no dharmatā at all, even conventionally.

Finally, if the Dharma were something permanent, the Buddha would not have spoken of its decline and disappearance, and neither would have Nāgārjuna, Maitreyanatha, and so on in very clear terms. All compounded phenomena are impermanent. The Dharma is compounded. If you imagine the Dharma is permanent you have contravened your own four seals, beginning with the first, "all compounded phenomena are suffering."

The rest as we know as the regularly stated in the sūtras "All compounded phenomena are suffering. All compounded phenomena are empty and lack self. Nirvana is peace."

If you claim the Dharma is permanent and ultimate, this is tantamount to declaring it is not empty and self.

A friend following this discussion, who does not have an account, sent me some interesting remarks by Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche:

Unknown said:
"Most people who consider themselves Buddhists do not tend to study what the Buddha himself taught, but instead just imitate one another. I don't know why it is but people just love to imitate one another and follow traditions. Nonetheless, it is not enough to just go around copying how other people act and dress, repeating what others say and do, dressing like yogis and dropping the names of lamas.

"However, the Buddha is not the true saviour or protector, the teachings known as the Dharma are, but you are the one who needs to apply them—hence it comes down to you saving yourself.

"Pondering this then, we must ask ourselves what we can actually place our trust in and rely upon. If we follow this line of reasoning we can see that we cannot even fully rely on the precious Buddha. Forget about our teachers, even the Buddha himself cannot completely protect us. All of the volumes of scriptures in the Buddhist canon cannot protect us. Even if we had a congregation of a thousand ordained monks whom we asked, "Please protect me; I am relying on you!" they couldn't do it, for they cannot grant true everlasting protection. So we really need to think about what it is that we can rely upon and trust completely and utterly with all of our body, heart and soul.

"So what is the true refuge, one that is 100% infallible? In the Buddhist teachings it is taught that one should take refuge in the dharmakaya, one's own mind. This statement is quite significant and contains a lot of meaning, so let me repeat it: you should take refuge in the dharmakaya, the nature of your own mind. The nature of your own mind is the only genuine, true protector; it is the only thing that is truly trustworthy and reliable.

"Don’t accept this just because I say so, instead really question and examine whether this is how things are or not. You must look into it personally and decide for yourself whether it is true or not. We all need to get to the point where we have confidence in ourselves, instead of always placing our trust in others, letting ourselves be led by the hand and just following whatever others say and do."

Malcolm wrote:
It is pretty simple -- there isn't the slightest bit of empirical evidence that from Mahāyāna onward any of these texts, sūtra and tantras, long oral lineage or short treasure lineage, were indeed spoken by the Buddha and so on.

Based upon this, I really think the standard of accepting and rejecting Buddhist teachings ought to be based not upon their putative origin, but rather, whether or not they are well-spoken.

If someone chooses to believe all the treasures we have received to date, for example, are the words of Padmasambhava, this is just fine. But it is a conscious choice for a Westerner not raised in Tibet in the Nyingma and Kagyu traditions to believe this.

This also presents problems. Many tantras are not "well spoken" if taken literally.  But tantras that might be considered mere manuals of sorcery and necromancy are rendered "well-spoken" through a process interpretive extraction of meaning.

Many treasures are very beautifully composed, and correspond well with the meaning of sūtra and tantra as we have them. Many sadhanas we have, in all schools are well-spoken, beautiful compositions, that correspond well to the interpretative pyrotechnics used to extract the meaningful essence from the raw ore of the tantras.

My personal opinion is that Dzogchen tantras are among the most well-spoken of Buddhist texts, which is one of my main reasons for being enthusiastic about them, and which require almost no need for hermeneutic strategies like the six limits and so on commonly employed to extract meaning from tantras generally understood by western scholars to be composed in India.

When confronted with the things that people like Kim Katami say, or Majorie Quinn, and frankly, many other people advertising themselves as teachers these days, their statements and theories appear to me to very crude and not well stated, not in accord with what I personally understand to be well-spoken.

When confronted with novelties like Kalima as a yidam, it is very hard, as far as I am concerned, to justify her inclusion as yidam deity, as the basis of an authentic Buddhist path. So when Christy McNally is bestowing Kāli empowerments, and Michael Roach is writing Jesus Sadhanas, I personally think it is mistaken. But, obviously no one is listening to me. In the end it is left to each of us to be responsible for own path and practice.

Thus, the concern for proving the provenance of a lineage seems to be like chasing a willow wisp, it is something always just out of grasp, and the force we use to try and catch it, just pushes it slightly more beyond our reach.

In conclusion: the only proof anyone is able to offer for the validity of their own lineage is their own faith in it; and the only proof of the invalidity of some other lineage is their lack of faith in it.

This leads us, sadly, right back to the confusion of the Kalamas and the Buddha's reply:

It is proper for you, Kalamas, to doubt, to be uncertain; uncertainty has arisen in you about what is doubtful. Come, Kalamas. Do not go upon what has been acquired by repeated hearing; nor upon tradition; nor upon rumor; nor upon what is in a scripture; nor upon surmise; nor upon an axiom; nor upon specious reasoning; nor upon a bias towards a notion that has been pondered over; nor upon another's seeming ability; nor upon the consideration, 'The monk is our teacher.' Kalamas, when you yourselves know: 'These things are bad; these things are blamable; these things are censured by the wise; undertaken and observed, these things lead to harm and ill,' abandon them.

Now if I were trying to attack Aro gTer, to demean them, to slander them personally, to cast aspersions on the character of their teachers, etc...  I could understand why somebody would come tho their defence.  But I am not doing that.  I am putting forward commonly accepted (in a Vajrayana context) criteria for authenticity and asking if they satisfy these criteria and NOBODY has made a relevant response.

Malcolm wrote:
Greg, there are no commonly accepted criteria. As I pointed out to you, there are Sakyas and Gelugpas who still reject the treasure tradition in toto. Many excellent scholars in from the 11th to the 14th century and later, wrote rebuttals to various traditions in a form of literature called sngags log sun 'byung, i.e. refuting false mantra. Traditions, texts and persons accused of being spurious and fradulent include Chod/Shijey, the earliest Dzogchen texts (what even need to mention later texts?), the Guhyagarbha Tantra, Guru Chowang by name, and so on.

The basic rebuttal to these polemical attacks comes in the form of this citation by the Buddha from the Sūtra of Encouraging Altruistic Intent (ā rya-adhyāśaya-sañcodana-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra ):

Those bhiḳsus claim, "Generosity and so on, is completely worldly behavior and is not a Dharma taught in the sūtras nor in vinaya. This is not Dharma, so do not give it respect!" Those foolish men do not know that anything at all that is well spoken is the word of the Buddha. Because they have been blessed by Māra, they reject the Dharma of those Dharma-upholding bhikṣus and engage in the karma of rejecting the Dharma. Because they engage in the karma of rejecting the Dharma, they fall into error.

Grigoris said:
Given the lack of evidence, I see no reason why any rational person would conclude that they are authentic.

Malcolm wrote:
In reality, the only evidence one needs to see is whether or not their Dharma, such as it is, is well-spoken.

Grigoris said:
Now it is granted that at the beginning of the terma "tradition" (it was not a tradition when it kicked off) there were no criteria to judge authenticity, but that was two centuries ago.  I think that currently we can agree that there are methods to prove authenticity, albeit subjective.

Malcolm wrote:
Greg, the Treasure tradition is more than a thousand years old. So, I think you must have made a hasty mistake. The earliest Buddhist terton in the Padmasambhava sense of the term was Sangye Lama, who lived in the early 11th century. Bonpo termas also date to this period, with Shenchen Luga's revelations.

In all of that time, there really is no method for proving a treasure is valid or invalid, apart from some respected person expressing their approval of the treasure itself. Though, there have been people trying to act as tertons, who, much to their surprise, revealed boxes of turds because someone caught them out in their act and substituted their treasure for shit.

And even today, in Tibet, there are successful tertons who are accused of being frauds by some, and heralded as buddhas by others. It just isn't a certain enterprise with exacting standards. Even more problematical are pure visions -- for example, Shugden texts and so on are claimed to be a pure vision teaching.

As to your final point, apparently many rational people do conclude the Aro crew are authentic enough, and the proof of this is that they have many followers. Books by Aro people like Dangerous Friend remain popular and in print at Shambhala Pubs, and so on.

All of this attachment to credentials and validation is a māra of gigantic proportions.

I personally could care less if Aro teachings are authentic or not. I don't see you hassling Ivo, or the Flaming Jewel people, or Pema Khandro, and so on, thus your motives in demanding Aro people to prove their authenticity are rather...misguided in my opinion.

When you examine the history of such polemics, their targets tend to ignore the fuss and just continue to do what they do, heedless of their critics. I suspect the Aro folk will do just that. At this point, you are banging your head against a wall of indifference to you or anyone else's opinion about them.

I’m struggling a bit with the extreme relativist position here. Not because of its logical consistency or inconsistency - more because of its practical implications.

If you take it purely at face value then you would conclude that, say, Kim Katami might be on the 8th bhumi, Dominic Geshe Rinpoche might be an enlightened teacher rather than a fraud, and Christie MacNally may have revealed a valid Kali empowerment.

Malcolm wrote:
But people do conclude such things, and they do so every day. We understand that Kim Katami's strange notions about bhumis do not correspond to anything taught in any Dharma text with which we are familiar. It is an issue mainly of doxographical consistency, in his case.

Marjorie Quinn, as far as I can tell, as well as Katami, both have rather serious personality disorders.

Kālima empowerments seem to be growing in popularity in some Buddhist circles. It is a trend worth observing.

Equally there are observable features that increase our confidence in a revealed teaching.  Conformance to basic buddhavacana is one. Acceptance by other prominent teachers is another.  Existence of notable practitioners who have practiced it and confirm that its good is a third. These are all forms of appeals to authority.

But if we accept no authority, we are ultimately left with nothing. Why, then, follow any teacher or do any practice

Malcolm wrote:
.

And, Peter, I did set forth the only authority that actually matters -- one's own opinion. If we follow a teacher, it is because we decide it is of value. If we practice, we decide it is of value. No one else can decide these things for us. Correct? So obviously it follows that the only authority that matters in matters of religion is ourselves. And further, if we think someone is a fraud, it is merely because we think so, there is actually no objective standard for determining such things, other than if someone claims they are Buddhist for example, but starts arguing that permanent functional phenomena are a core teaching of the Buddha. Obviously this can be rejected because it does not correspond to Buddhist doxography. But this merely is by comparison with what it says in this text, as opposed to claims someone might be making about what Buddhism asserts. It is merely a question of dogmatic rigor.

With respect to the treasure tradition, there is no source of doxographical consistency that permits one to know that this terma is true and this one is false, apart from a) embarrassing a prospective terton by putting shit in his terma cache if he is going to reveal a terma in public; b) proving that this or that terma violates general Buddhist dogma, 3) relying on the opinion of some elder. whose opinion one has subjectively decided to follow for this or that reason.

If someone proclaims they have a Dharma that, in all truth cannot be found to contradict the basic teachings of the Buddha, it becomes increasingly difficult to reject their claim to be promulgating a legitimate teachings if it never contradicts what we understand the Buddha's teachings to be, in other words, if it is corresponds to the dogmas we accept as Buddhism.

PeterC said:
There has to be some basic motivation for our choice of practice lineage beyond “I had a special feeling about it” (although that seems to be the main criterion for many practitioners today).

We are suffering, we look for a solution, we follow one that is suited to our proclivitie, and try to measure up the doxographical standards we think it sets forth. That is all. There is absolutely nothing objective about such choices.

PeterC said:
This doesn’t have to be unassailable logic, just reasonable evidence that leads you to conclude that its a better use of of your time than practicing something else or practicing nothing.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, people who folllow Aroter think that pursuing these teachers and their teachings are a reasonable use of their time -- and since no one has produced any evidence whatsoever that they are teaching something which does not on all major points conform to the Dharma as we all understand it, then basically, critics of Aro are suffering from the fallacy of originalism: that is, the fallacy of claiming that of two teachings which conform to each other on all major points, one is valid and the other is false because we approve of the origin of the former and not of the latter.

PeterC said:
Between unassailable, definitive proof and completely arbitrary preference there is a large spectrum of relative confidence.  Just because we can’t get to unassailable proof doesn’t mean we should discard everything in between.

Kindly pardon me if I'm not correct in this, but it does seem you are not fully familiar with what an appeal to authority is. As Malcolm just noted if you both accept the authority then there is no logical fallacy in appealing to it. Further, the appeal to authority fallacy is actually about an appeal to false authority and using such an authority as evidence in your argument when the authority is not really an authority on the facts relevant to the argument.

Generally speaking, in a section titled Tibetan Buddhism an appeal to the text of Maitreyanatha simply does not meet the definition of the logical fallacy of an appeal to authority.

Grigoris said:
This idea that he can have truth and authority when it suits him, is rather unsavoury and stinks of hypocrisy (rather than inconsistency).

Malcolm wrote:
Sorry to break it to you, but notions like "truth" and "authority" are merely conventions, and flimsy ones at that when it comes to the domain of religion. When you follow a religion, all you have is your own opinion that "this is true and this is false" since the most basic metaphysical principles in a religion can neither be proven nor disproven by conventional means at all— not god, not karma, not rebirth, not even awakening. The arrogant supposition that these things can be proven is one of the chief reasons people turn into fundamentalist ninnies who madly wave sutras at each other in Buddhism, and other scriptures in other religions.

And when it comes to empirical validation, then, it is pretty stupid to say gravity does not function near an entity that has sufficient mass to attract objects to it, since these things can be easily verified by anyone with a bit of math and observation. Now, remind me, just what was the math that irrefutably demonstrates karma and rebirth?

Now, we can certainly agree, for example, that Maitreyanatha expressed a position, an opinion, that the only true refuge was the Buddha since he possesses the dharmakāya. But no one at all, not even Maitreyanatha, can prove the Buddha indeed had such a possession. it is just dogma. Dogma is fun, but it never liberated anyone from afflictions.

People who believe "truth" and "authority" as ultimate principles just plant the seeds for fundamentalism in their own minds. Ultimately, there is no truth and no authority, and in terms of conventional truths and authorities, we pick the ones we like, and we reject the ones we don't like. Hopefully the conventions and truths we pick are not harmful to ourselves or others.

And having said that, I still cannot see for the life of me why the existence of Aroter is such an existential threat to some Buddhists on this board. They are not harming anyone, and as far as I know, they all accept rebirth, dependent origination, karma, Padmsambhava, Samantabhadra, Buddha and so on as meaningful. Who cares if some of their deities look like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean? Most Buddhists in the world, who have an opinion about it, think that Vajrayāna just a bunch of made-up corrupt, crypto-Hindu bullshit anyway, further corrupted by Tibetan shamanism.  And some on this board really are throwing stones while inhabiting glass houses.

As though his mind was influenced by Mara, [22] he did not beseech the Blessed One: "May the Blessed One remain, O Lord!. May the Happy One remain, O Lord, throughout the world-period, for the welfare and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, well being, and happiness of gods and men!"

Based on this same principle why would not be possible to regenerate or replenish lets say the damaged or lack of fire  essence in a given organ just by either visualizing the colour of the fire or by lighting a fire nearby resting in the primordial state and  integrating with the essence of fire ?
These types of examples play hand in hand with my first question regarding whether the regeneration is possible while resting in the primordial state.


Malcolm wrote:
Hi Florin, that is a good question.

There are two levels of ye shes, pristine consciousness. The first level is the three pristine consciousnesses of the basis, essence, nature, and energy they are ultimate, unconditioned, etc. Then there are five relative pristine consciousnesses which are something like the rtsal of the basis, which when not recognized are reified as the five elements.

Someone who is very advanced in the second vision, or in the third vision, may very well be able to live merely off the five pristine consciousnesses through dharmakāya chulen. I would not count on anyone else being able to match this accomplishment who has not reached a high level of practice of thogal, as in the case of Nyala Pema Dudul who lived off dharmakāya chulen in the manner you are suggesting. He only managed to do this for a few years before attaining the body of light, or so we are told.

In tregchod there is no integration with the elements in this way.

But you clearly are not paying attention to the fact one person's questionable lineage is another persons Dharma tradition. So far, no one has produced one, single shred of evidence the Aro folks are teaching a dharma that contradicts the Dharma.

For example, lets take the Bonpo teaching -- is this valid Dharma or not? We can see that point for point Bonpos teach everything we find in Buddhism. If we think it is a copy, is it invalid because it is a copy, even though the meaning is the same in every way, through and through? If the meaning is the same, why won't the result be the same? If the copy is invalid, how can the original be valid? And if the original is valid, how can a copy be invalid if the meaning, point for point, is the same in every respect?

Grigoris said:
And let's just run a quick rational review of the situation:

Aro gTer have no lineage.  No amount of "To quoque" logical fallacies can deny this.

The terma has not be ratified/certified/recognised by anybody other than it's writer and thus it's legitimacy is questionable.

Malcolm wrote:
It is not like there is a treasure ratification committee. Treasures are "ratified" because a highly respected person reviews the text by various means and decides it is good. But it is all based on the chain of authority that ends with one's own personal decision to accept or reject this or that teaching as "true or false."

This is the position the entire treasure tradition finds itself: the first well known terton, Nyangral Nyima Ozer, was not "authenticated" by anyone, and was roundly criticized by those outside his circle of disciples, and others with whom he associated who were also involved in treasure revelations.

For example, in his composition of the Indian biography of Padmasambhava, Jetsun Taranatha laughs at people who accept treasure biographies like the Life of the Lotus Born ( bzang gling ma ), and so on.

Nyang's successor, Guru Chowang, too was roundly criticized in 13th century Tibet for just making things up. Guru Chowang was not recognized by anyone as the reincarnation of Nyang Ral, he just went around and started telling people that he was Nyang Ral's incarnation. At that time, the treasure tradition was just getting a head of steam. Guru Chowang, BTW, is the original terton of the Seven Line Prayer that you chant everyday.

Much later on, Dili Terton, aka Dudjom Lingpa, without any teacher at all started writing down termas. But no one told him to go ahead and reveal treasures, and no one formally recognized him as the incarnation of Kathog Duddul Dorje.

Nyala Chanchub Dorje, ChNN's guru, just started revealing treasures, no one told him to. No one ratified his treasures, and they were largely unknown to anyone outside his direct circle of disciples in his region of Kham. He was well known as a physician, not a terton.

The reason I point all this out is that stating something is questionable value because it was not "ratified" by anyone in fact even applies to Mahāyāna sūtras in general, and the tantras as well.

You see, Greg, the only reason you accept the treasure tradition as valid that you have decided to do so, and since  you have decided for yourself this or that treasure was a valid teaching, you seek it out.

You can try and claim that you accept these as valid because it was ratified by this or that person, but even here, you are accepting this person's authority purely on the basis of your own opinions about what to accept and what to reject. The same goes for Dhogyal, its followers, and detractors as well.And that same is true for Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Christianity, and so on  There is no objective authority in these matters, no objective standard by which we can confirm at the outset "this one is true, this one is false" apart from examining the teachings themselves to see if their meaning is in accord with the Dharma. Sometimes we decide that this or that does not conform to the meaning, sometimes we do. But it is all based on our personal opinions. The idea that it is based on any thing else is ridiculous.

Even more problematical is the notion that false termas contain no blessings. Let us say for example, someone reveals some "mind" treasure, in every respect conforming with the meaning of sūtra, tantra, and atiyoga. It however is denounced as false because the terton's character is suspect, etc. What does it mean to say that a treasure has no blessings? From the point of view of some Sakyas and Gelugpas, the treasure tradition in general lacks blessings completely because even though the meaning of the teaching may conform perfectly, there is no continuous lineage which can be traced back to an Indian master, and ultimately, to the Buddha.


Grigoris said:
This leaves us with one more important factor that can lend legitimacy to Aro gTer, or put an end to this pointless debate:  Who is Doc's teacher?

Malcolm wrote:
His gurus include HH Dalai Lama, HH Sakya Trizin, HH Dudjom Rinpoche, Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje RInpoche, CR Lama, etc., but his root guru is the late Kunzang Dorje Rinpoche, who composed the Tummo section of the Khandro Thugthig.

Grigoris said:

Malcolm wrote:
As pointed out above, many tertons just start revealing termas without being told they should reveal termas. The usual procedure is to reveal them, and then practice them for many years in secrecy. Only when signs of their efficacy arise, do tertons in general start promulgating their revelations. But their efficacy can only be proven by practicing them oneself, and attaining awakening. So too, the only way to prove them false is to practice them and fail to attain awakening.

Grigoris said:
Undeniable, because the onus is on the people making the claim to prove it true, something which has not been done.

Malcolm wrote:
Can you provide anything more than anecdotal evidence that any treasure is "valid?" Apart from personally engaging in their practice themselves, the only pramāṇa, authority or valid cognition, upon which one may rely upon for authenticating treasures is śabdapramāṇa, the authority that depends on the testimony of a reliable witness. But in that case, how does one establish the witness as an authority?

In the end, śabdapramāṇa amounts to no more than this, as the great Dzogchen master and scholar, Gendun Chophel remarks:

Whatever most people like appears as the truth; whatever most mouths agree on appears as a philosophical tenet. Inside of each person is a different form of valid knowledge, with an adamantine scripture supporting it.

Madman's Middle Way, pg. 63.

And:

Inferential valid knowledge is produced from direct awareness; inference analyzes whether direct perception is true or false; because the child is serving as the father's witness, I am uncomfortable about positing conventional validity.

Madman's Middle Way, pg. 62

And finally, to demonstrate the poverty of your wish for a certain proof that anything can be proven to be true or false with respect to validating a treasure and any other teaching at all:

One may think:"We concede that our decisions are unreliable, but when we follow the decisions of the Buddha, we are infallible." Then who decided the Buddha was infallible? If you say, "The great scholars and adepts like Nāgārjuna decided that he was infallible," then who decided that Nāgārjuna was infallible? If you say, "The Foremost Lama [Tshong kha pa] decided it," then who knows that the Foremost Lama is infallible? If you say, "Our kind and peerless lama, the excellent and great so and so decided," than infallibility, which depends on your own excellent lama, is decided by your own mind. In fact, therefore, it is a tiger who vouches for a lion, it is a yak who vouches for a tiger, it is a dog who vouches for a yak, it is a mouse who vouches for a dog, it is an insect who vouches for a mouse. Thus, an insect is made the final voucher for them all. Therefore, when one analyzes in detail the final basis for any decision, apart from coming back to one's own mind, nothing else whatsoever is perceived.

Madman's Middle Way, pp. 49-50

So your demand that the Aro people prove their treasures are valid is really quite foolish, and your denunciation of their teachings is based solely on your own jaundiced eye.

If one does, one is a hypocrite, it does not matter if one is a beginner or a high tulku. I made absolutely no assessment of any particular person's mental state. There, now even stupid people reading this thread should be clear about it.

As far as the Outer, inner, and secret guru is concerned, there is no hierarchy where one is higher/better than the other.

& according to the 3rd jamgon kongtrul rinpoche, it is actually not appropriate to separate them. (since these aspects are inseparable)

To be fair, if arguing from the perspective of the Uttaratantra then all aspects of the Buddha are not compounded phenomena, even the buddhas body (major and minor marks). Shentongpa's will go so far as to say all of the major and minor marks are fully present within everyone even if not perceived. However I am not interested in that debate, just throwing it out there.

Malcolm wrote:
But from the aspect of the Prajñāpāramitā, as we know, whoever perceives a tathāgata through marks is not perceiving the tathāgata at all, to quote Conze's Diamond Sūtra translation:


The Lord continued: 'What do you think, Subhuti, can the Tathagata be seen by the possession of his marks?' Subhuti replied: 'No indeed, O Lord. And why? What has been taught by the Tathagata as the possession of marks, that is truly a no-possession of no-marks.' The Lord said: 'Wherever there is possession of marks, there is fraud, wherever there is no-possession of no-marks there is no fraud. Hence the Tathagata is to be seen from no marks as marks.

tranides said:
My teacher use to say, that even if we wont achieve the fruit of the path, we are planting karmic seeds of future acomplishemnt. Which is good anyway. I also have a question about thinking about the process lineary - except training in pure vision one will probably train in plenty other things, so his klesha will be purified gradualy which means hes wannabe pure vision will become more and more pure (kinda stupid expression), wont it? Tho i might be completly wrong.

Malcolm wrote:
The kleśas are not something to remove from the mind, the wisdoms are not something to add to the mind; the kleśas are themselves self-liberated wisdom when one cuts through grasping even though there is nothing to cut.

Therefore, cutting through grasping is the actual practice of all paths, from hinayāna to atiyoga. The only difference between the yānas, lower to higher, is the coarseness of the grasping one cuts through.

One does not start a sadhana, for example, beginning with pure vision. We begin by meditating that all phenomena are empty, free from extremes. Then,  for a while we engage in conceptual proliferation that we pretend is pure. In the end, we let all that conceptual proliferation vanish back into emptiness free from extremes. This is the essence of the creation stage and the completion stage.

Those people, whose own afflictions are not in check, that demand or suggest others observe pure vision are definitely hypocrites, whether they are teachers or students.

Therefore, everyone (gurus included) should check and see whether their own afflictions are in check prior to criticizing what they imagine to be the afflicted perceptions of others. If people really did this, I bet the silence would be deafening.

Full disclosure-- everything I say and do is merely the glow of the raging bonfire of my own afflictions, which is why you never see me recommending to anyone that they should "practice" pure vision with respect to anything or anyone as a rebuke or a remedy to some worldly controversy. I have discussed the notion of training in pure vision with respect to the creation stage, because that is the essential theory of the creation stage.

More to the point, if one has to train in pure vision one is afflicted. If one is afflicted, one's vision is not pure. One's vision will not become pure by imagining that one is a buddha in the middle of a palace surrounded by gods, goddesses, and so on. It will not become pure by imagining one's guru is a buddha.

Aro Lingma is a fictional character, becuase Togden Rangrig had no such daughter, don't you think a terton of her "stature" would be at least mentioned in his biography? Since vajrayana teaching depends on the lineage, even if the words of the teaching are not in contradiction with buddhadharma, if there is no lineage, there is no blessing. You can read biography of Terton Rangrig here:

Whatever made you think that the person described as the father of "Aro Lingma" is Nyala Rangrig Dorje? It certainly is not evident from the proffered bio one can find on the web. And you have to admit the melong tied to the guy's beard is a nice touch -- I have always found the Aro pirate themes amusing. Even if the backstory of Aro is entirely fantasy, we should keep our facts straight about what they are claiming as opposed to what they are not claiming.

What you seem to fail to understand that is that Buddhist texts are full of ahistorical persons, such as Mañjuśrī, Avalokiteśvara, Tāra, and so on. We have ballads of Gesar concerning his invasion and conquest of Germany which many Tibetans, for example, accept at face value.

dzoki said:
If anybody has doubt that Aro is a fake or authentic terma you can ask senior students of Chime Rigdzin, what Rinpoche, who was himself a terton, thought about Chogyam's activitiy as a "terton". You can ask James Law, Gudrun Knuasenberger or Ugyen Chencho Rinpoche.

Malcolm wrote:
You do understand that citing chains of authority only leads back to one's own judgment, right? In the end it is we ourselves who decide what is false and what is true. No one can do that for us, not even the Buddha.

So, you have decided the Aro trip is fraudulent, and that is totally cool with me.

But let me put it you this way. If some Sakyapa or Gelugpa came up to you and said that your practice was fraudulent because it had no lineage and was just a fantasy concocted by a Tibetan named Dili Terton, how would you feel? You would feel completely disrespected. Well, I am pointing out to you that there are hundreds of people who find a great deal of value in Aroter, who follow it, try to practice it, and if they were to read your denunciations of their tradition, I can imagine that they would feel completely disrespected. So you need to put yourself in their place, and see how things feel from their point of view, and frankly, stop being so unkind to them with your self-righteous denunciations. Just as you cannot prove the validity of your tradition, you also cannot prove their tradition is false.

All we can do is live and let live and each go our separate ways, which is how Tibetans actually deal with these issues. You might try following their lead.

Come on Malcolm. Ok, just for a sport of it, I have one name for you: Aro Khyungchen Lingma - the originator of the terma, a lady who apparently lived in Tibet of Chogyam's imagination, in other words there is no lineage to this stuff.

Malcolm wrote:
You realize that this critique, absence of lineage, has been leveled against the whole treasure tradition, right? And frankly, just as there has never  been any satisfactory answer to these critiques other than "I believe this," or "My teacher says it is true," (or false as the case may be) likewise here the criticism amounts to "I don't believe this." The same applies to all tantras, sūtras, and collections like Abhidhamma, likely the very first "terma" in the history of Buddadharma.

Do you have any idea how many names of people there are in Buddhist texts for whom evidence of their historical existence is utterly lacking? Why do we believe in such people? The answer is simple —— someone told us to and we do, even though we have no proof these names were ever connected with sentient beings who lived and died on this planet, or any other.

Aro Lingma may be a fantasy, or she may have been a historical person. I don't know and neither do you. We can have our opinions about these things, but opinions are not facts. Not only that, there are many termas and tertons that have come and gone in Tibet, whose names we have never heard of and will never know, too minor to have been recorded by anyone, too obscure, too remote. It is merely an accident that Chogyur Lingpa found favor with Khyentse Wangpo -- in Nangchen everyone thought he was a fraud and laughed him out of town. Even Kongtrul records that he doubted Chogyur Lingpa at first.

Having said all that, it could be useful for you to review Gendun Chophel's theory of confirmation bias:

Beyond each mountain pass is a different religious sect with thousands of scholars and fools who follow it saying, "Just this is true, this will not deceive you." This self-authorization of one's own truth delights a group of similar beings; when told to a group who does not agree, they are scornful.

—— The Madman's Middle Way, Lopez; Chicago, 2006.

This is how we sound, and we sound scornful.

bkra lam me (བཀྲ་ལམ་མེ་) is an actual word. Apart from obvious phonetic mistakes like confusing bkra (brilliant) with khra (harrier), and not understanding that me reduplicates of the final consonant in lam as an intensifier, quite frankly, I have seen any number of fanciful etymologies of Tibetan words explained by Tibetans, based on similar kinds of errors,  for example the fanciful etymolgies we see for bye ma la mu tra, a.k.a Paṇḍita Vimalamitra of Vima sNying thig fame.

These kinds of fanciful etymologies are also found in Indian Buddhist text.  All that this explanation shows is that Chogyam's Tibetan is awful.

In reality, he is talking about ojas ( mdangs) the most subtle part of food refined into a subtle fluid that maintains health, vitality, sexual potency, and ultimately, one's life force. Ojas means "brilliant."

But he is not talking about the Dharma here, he is talking about the effect of stress, sexual misconduct, etc., on one's brilliance. The principle thing that degrades ojas is sadness and stress.

Trungpa invented a whole new vocabulary for Westerners out of Tibetan words that has little or nothing at all do with how they are actually understood in Tibetan culture. But I am sure you think he is an authentic terton. Why?

So, you are going have to do a little better to find something Chogyam is teaching which really contradicts the Dharma. Fanciful explanations based on ignorance of Tibetan isn't sufficient, because Tibetans engaged in plenty of fanciful explanations based on ignorance of Sanskrit, as anyone knows who has taken the time to read Sakya Paṇḍita's Differentiation of the Three Vows.

A personal aside:

BTW, I was quite young in the Dharma when I met Ngagpa Yeshe Dorje Rinpoche (the recollection of whose name never fails to bring tears to my eyes), at a time when he and Chogyam did not get along anymore. But I have to admit that Ngagpa Rimpoche emphatically stated to me personally that he wanted no part in any conflict with Chogyam, despite Rinpoche's personal disappointment in many of Chogyam's decisions. In my youthful delusion that I mistook for faith, out of pride I took up a grudge that was not mine to carry. That is why I issued an apology for saying unkind things about the Aro folk, such as  "Their teachings are fake termas."

There is no authority upon which we may rely, apart from our own judgement. But we are not omniscient, and many teachings loudly once decried as fraudulent are now praised everywhere without question. Who is to say that Aroter is not something like this? You? Me? Anyone?

My experience in the UK is that facts really don't matter; so I'll just say what I am detecting:

Poor whites and poor blacks and  poor asians all feel they are treated worst of all, have the least privileges, suffer the most discrimination etc.

These things ebb and flow, but after terrorist attacks it has been easy for politicians and others to galvanise poor whites into everything from voting for far right extremism to white gang vigilante actions. The presence of unemployed EU immigrants claiming social benefits and housing denied to others has played its part.
In a 'chicken and egg' situation, black and asian gang activity has become a major urban issue.

Young black males are disproportionately represented in UK jails. More of them are subjected to 'stop and search'..............and just maybe it is because most of the crimes are committed by people who fit that profile. And so the cycle continues. Meanwhile, our 'justice' system lets off pretty white girls who stab people because jail may harm their careers. We really are not far away from Hicksville, USA.

The Brexit vote was partly a manifestation of the fear and dislike of immigrants. A few think immigration has become uncontrolled and voted becuase of that. Others, however, just don't want those with dark skins and who don't speak English and have 'foreign' religions.  They probably think Trump is a hero.


Malcolm wrote:
Well, in the US, poor whites are mainly pissed because they feel, wrongly, that their privilege has been eroded by 1) policies which enable the advancement of black people and 2) a shrinking demographic. Meanwhile, since Reagan, education funding in what we call red states has been stripped to the bone, and since in red states they historically depress property taxes and so on to attract retirees and industry, they cannot fund schools themselves. They imagine, wrongly, that they are being cheated, that their taxes are being squandered (they are, they just are blaming the wrong folks), and that all their problems lie in Washington, which is bullshit. Their problems are local, and a result of their own penchant for voting up guns and Jesus and voting down education, birth control, gun control, higher taxes on property and so on, they have basically screwed themselves, and things won't get better until they understand how pernicious the GOP vision for the USA actually is.

And I think that this is the tragic mistake you are making:  You are confounding the external appearances, with the Ngakpa practices per se.  Of course they are related, but...  Instead of warning people about getting hung up on the external appearances of being a Ngakpa, you are dissuading them from becoming Ngakpa.

Malcolm wrote:
When I say I dissuade people from becoming ngakpas. I don't mean that I tell people, "don't take empowerments, don't practice the two stages, don't recite mantras," I mean that when someone comes to me and asks me how they can be "ordained" as a ngakpa (and there is actually no such thing as a ngakpa ordination) by receiving the hair empowerment, etc., I tell them it is a bad idea to receive the hair empowerment because either you cannot cut your hair at all (my tradition) or you have to constantly apologize for cutting your hair through confessions (Dudjom Tersar).

So it is better that people, especially beginners, do not take on this commitment. If someone has done their ngondro, is stable in their practice, has experience of the two stages, and is committed to being the equivalent of a Buddhist sadhu in some respect, then that is fine and they are free to do as they wish.

Basically, if you have to ask someone, "Should I become a ngakpa," the answer from them should always be "No." If you have to ask, you are not ready.

This is completely separate from my evaluation of the pros and cons of the Ngakpa tradition as a socio-economic phenomena in Tibetan culture.

It seems like you missed the main point of my post, but i'll bite I guess. There are plenty of white people (both urban and rural) low down enough of the socioeconomic ladder, with no prospects for education, work or betterment, whose communities are often dogged by the exact same plagues as minorities in a similar socioeconomic place, such that their "white privilege" amounts to a whole HELL of a lot less than their status as lumpen proletariat does.

Personally, I think there is a massive amount of "spiritual" materialism connected with interest in the Ngakpa tradition, but the same can be said of every tradition within Buddhism, which is a larger point. And it is also one reason why I generally discourage people from "becoming ngakpas." This has nothing to do with feeling that one's performance of Nāga pujas safeguards refugees. One does not need to be a "ngakpa" to do a Nāga puja, though it may seem more impressive when done by folks kitted out in full ngakpa gear.

You know you are in Kali Yuga when a discussion about "What it means to be a ngakpa" devolves into a debate about the marketability of the practices, the commodification of the Dharma.

Malcolm wrote:
One, Śākyamuni Buddha is the buddha of the Kāli Yuga.

Two, Buddhism has always been commodified. Buddhism has been a big business at all its various points in development in Asia, both in its land of origin and in all lands to which it spread, generated and generates a huge amount of economic activity, and still continues to do so. Originally, Buddhism did not offer rites and so on for lay people. Why? Because as the Buddha said in the Mahaparinibbana Sutta, the brahmins faithful to the Buddha would be responsible for carrying out such activities. However, over time, in competition with brahmins, Buddhist ritualists began offering rites to compete with nonbuddhist brahmins both for money and influence through the performance of rituals. When Buddhism spread to Tibet, for example, foreign and foreign-trained Buddhist ritualists, exemplified by the archetypal ngakpa, Guru Padmasambhava, immediately began to compete with the indigenous ritualists (which we now call Bonpos) for religious, economic, and social influence. We see the same trend in Southeast Asia, the Far-East, and now, here in the West, where we we have the affluence to import Tibetan ritualists to perform rituals on our behalf and train us to do them ourselves (one reason why ChNN trains us to do all kinds of rites in an essentialized form is so that we won't have to pay others to do them for us through lacking skill in Tibetan language).

The specifics of the kinds of contracts patrons and priests have may continue to be somewhat pre-modern (though this is rapidly changing), but the fact is that an enormous amount of money shifts from the pockets of lay people into the hands of Tibetan religious professionals lay and ordained, all over Asia. For example, remember this?

Some people like to imagine that the commodification of Dharma, a.k.a Buddhism, is brand new. It isn't, it has been there right from the start. Ever since Anathapindika donated his garden to the Sangha, the professional Sangha has been involved in primitive capital accumulation, and has experienced all of the corruption and graft that entails. Evidence of this exists because there are rules governing misappropriation by monastics, which have rather sever penalties, say, as opposed to the total lack of penalty for drinking alcohol, killing animals, or harming plants. Further examples can be seen in the debate between Mahāyāna monastics and their non-Mahāyāna counterparts over the appropriateness of handling money, engaging in trade, and receiving fees for the performance of religious services and so on.

So, when we take a look at Buddhism as a human phenomena, we see that it also carries with it all human frailties and faults. Why do you think I make a distinction between Buddhism and Buddhadharma? The Ngakpa tradition and ngakpas themselves (being human) are not exempt from human impulses, urges, and practices.

Divākara from the Nalanda reported that in India there were two masters at Nalanda the abbot of Nalanda and Xuanzang's teacher Śīlabhadra and Jnanaprabha. The first taught the Three Turnings with the Third Turning as Yogacara and most definite whereas the latter taught the Madhyamka as the definite teaching.

But the Huayan Patriarch Fazang Xianshou notes that the Prajna Sutras cannot be classified as only second turning and in the end places Yogacara on a level lower than Madhyamaka.

Malcolm wrote:
This is anecdotal.

When you examine the bstan 'gyur, you will discover that there is almost nothing mentioned about the three turnings. The passage in the Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra about three turnings was ignore Asanga in his commentary on the sūtra. The other commentary, by Jn̄̄ānagarbha, also ignores the three turnings. It appears obvious then that this tiny section of the sūtra in question are regarded as being of little importance by Indian masters in India.

The notion of three turnings as a major device for interpreting sūtras was introduced to Tibet in the massive commentary on the Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra by the Korean master་་Won-ch'uk.  However, this is almost entirely ignored in Chinese Buddhism as well which seems to generally follow the Tientai school for dating and evaluating sūtras.

Madhyamikas would never accept this scheme since they regarded the Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra a provisional sūtra from the get go, and their criteria for evaluating definitive vs. provisional sūtras comes from the Akṣayamtinirdeśasūtra.

But this is all massively off topic.

ItsRaining said:
I found Śīlabhadra proposing the theory plausible as he is the teacher of Xuanzang (who in turn taught Won Chu'k) whose East Asian Yogacara school proposed the Three Turning teaching.

But I would agree that the Tiantai and Huayan evaluations are much better than the Three Turnings.

Malcolm wrote:
You’re missing the point. Indian masters who wrote commentaries on this text didn’t care about this tiny passage and it is evidently so since they ignore it completely.

I confessed I already know the teaching, including the meaning of thusness (presence) on reading books alone, but I took the direct introduction nonetheless.

According to Desid Sangye Gyatso, the 360 Yedrog have a couple of meanings. One has to do with the 360 joints of the body explained in Kālacakra which cause unhappiness of fear and so on when under the power of affliction.

But the meaning from "astrology" is more useful here. It has to do with connate gods and spirits ( lha dang 'dre ). He cites a text called Illumination (gnang gsal):

When the body and mind separate into two,
there are connate gods and demons. 
Those gods accompany the mind (sems) upward,
the spirits accompany the intellect (yid) of the deceased,
further, accompany the demon (bdud) of the deceased downward.

He continues that this means when one has obscurations, one is accompanied by demons; when free of obscuration, one is accompanied by gods.

Also they are considered harmful non human spirits.

However, in terms of the rite you are translating, it is probably best to go with "360 misfortunes"

Well, actually, I did't ask you that. You gave a relevant response to Matthew and then started on a largely irrelevant aside.

Malcolm wrote:
Personally, I think the socio-economic dimensions of the Ngakpa tradition are very relevant to any discussion of what it means to be a Ngakpa. Why? This in fact is one of the main reasons why every monastery wants to have a Tulku. No Tulku, no patrons. No patrons, no money. No money, no food.

My guru, Kunzang Dechen Lingpa, thoroughly trained his students in India to become proficient in ritual arts so that they could make a living, understanding that compared to the local Gelug monastery (which gets all the big donations and support from the CTA), his monasteries would struggle economically unless they were able to offer services useful to the local people.  In many monasteries in India, for example, they have menus for how much this rite costs, how much that one costs, and so on. So yes, the market plays an important role in religious services, and those services are subject to the laws of supply and demand. Why do you think it costs millions of dollars to host HHDL, whereas to host your teacher it costs merely a few grand? Put simply, HHDL is in much greater demand than your teacher, my teacher, etc.

When KDL came to the USA to do Healing Chod tours, he made it explicitly clear he was here in this country (USA) to raise money from people to support his monastery projects, which required capital he was unable to raise in India. Of course, he never turned anyone away from these events, but on the other hand, he was clear he was here to raise money. If no one showed up with money for the events, he would have gone home — and he said as much to the people who came. So, there was some demand for his services and he happily supplied them.

I understand this to be part of the wider context of the socio-economic role monasteries and so on have played for Tibetans for generations. And quite frankly, Ngakpas in Tibetan society were not just doing rites for this and that reason out of the kindness of their hearts. They expected to be paid for their services. We should understand this. You may be offended by treating the socio-economic facts of Buddhism in this way, but I live in the real world, where supply and demand is a constant issue.

Buddhism arose from the merchant class in India, among people who were very interested in making profits and generally contributed to the Sangha to generate merit so they would be more prosperous. Why? Because in sūtra after sūtra the Buddha encouraged lay people to a) generate profits through trade so that b) they could support the Sangha, and c) so that they could live happier lives.

You seem to regard Sakyamuni as the only Buddha and only source of reliable teachings.

You did not personally hear him teach, nor did you hear him explain his teachings.
You are totally reliant on teachers who have transmitted the scriptures.
Without those teachers you have nothing.

You misunderstand Vajrayana and Dzogchen to the point where you are trying desperately to assert an understanding of the sky using someone else's description of how Shakyamuni described the rocks. Because you are locked into that limitation, people can't explain anything to you.

Jyoti said:
Your view point is valid for a beginner on this definitive teaching due to the requirement for direct introduction. But the definitive teaching of mahayana is based on the meaning of the third noble truth, which is the state of the cessation of suffering. This mean the teaching assume the audience already attain the knowledge (vidya) that is required for the arriving of the meaning of the third truth.

Therefore, my standpoint is the same as the definitive teaching of mahayana, that is, I am not here to learn the meaning (from someone or teacher), and I didn't assume anyone here need to learn the meaning either. So this is the view that everyone is equalled as buddhas, this is a needed view because in the definitive teaching, there is no 'sentient beings' and no 'sufferings', as these are only the words of the provisional dharma, their real meaning is 'buddhas' and 'bliss' respectively.

In this prespective, in the standpoint of buddha, we have no other choice than the four reliances, 'a person' (or teacher) also is one of the element of uncertainty, every person has their own agenda and opinions, so can never be recommended as a source to be relied, in this case, only the dharma itself is the only reliable source, because the definitive dharma belongs to the side of the base which is changless and permanent. And as a 'buddha', our own view or understanding of the meaning of the scriptures that we relied is itself precious and has an authority on its own, it should not be judge/verify by the authority of person (or teacher) alone but by the meaning/truth of the dharma itself. This is the reason, we need the four reliances, and the reason why the Buddha want us to uphold them as his injunctions.

When it comes to the definitive teaching, no one, no teacher here is greater than the Buddha (because he is the teacher of teachers) and his injunctions (the four reliances) to Kasyapa. When the teaching of the Buddha is available, there is no excuse to rely on the person (teacher), than the dharma (due to the fact that the scriptures are still available in abundance).

The Mahaparinirvana sutra stated:

Bodhisattva Kasyapa said to the Buddha: "Well said, well said! What the Tathagata says is true, not false. I shall accept [your] word with the greatest respect, for example, just as if I had received an adamantine treasure. Just as the Buddha says, these bhiksus should stand [base themselves] on four things.

"What are the four? They should be based on Dharma, not the person; on the meaning, not the words; on the intelligence, not on consciousness; on the definitive sutras, not on the non-definitive sutras. They should well know these four things, but not four such persons."

The Buddha said:"We say that we should base ourselves on the definitive sutras [those which dig deep into the true meaning of Buddha-Dharma], and not on the non-definitive sutras. The non-definitive sutras are the sravaka vehicle. Hearing even the depth-plumbing storehouse of the Buddha-Tathagata, doubts raise their heads as regards all things and the person does not realise that this storehouse arises from the sea of great Wisdom, as in the case of a child who cannot distinguish one thing from another. This is the non-grasping of the meaning. '

Malcolm wrote:
The four reliances are great with respect to sūtrayāna teachings, which all are based in intellectual analysis.

Dzogchen however is based on intimate instructions one receives from a guru which enable one's direct perception of dharmatā, rendering the four reliances irrelevant.

For example, ChNN maintains that if we can be in "instant presence" for a very short period of time, a few seconds, our practice is continuing pretty well. I am not sure how useful being in instant presence for a few seconds is for evaluating the effectiveness of being in instant presence for pain management, though I am certain it is useful for understanding any physical sensation as phantasmagorical. On the other hand, I know very clearly the relationship between pain and śamatha, and I know that the Buddha himself (and there is no greater "Dzogchen master" than Śakyamuni Buddha in our epoch) relied on dhyāna to refresh himself and to deal with his own physical pain as he got older and older:

"It is, Ananda, only when the Tathagata, disregarding external objects, with the cessation of certain feelings, attains to and abides in the signless concentration of mind, [19] that his body is more comfortable.

I also am not someone who just goes by the Holy Word as reported by my fellow coreligionists.

When you examine the bstan 'gyur, you will discover that there is almost nothing mentioned about the three turnings. The passage in the Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra about three turnings was ignore Asanga in his commentary on the sūtra. The other commentary, by Jn̄̄ānagarbha, also ignores the three turnings. It appears obvious then that this tiny section of the sūtra in question are regarded as being of little importance by Indian masters in India.

The notion of three turnings as a major device for interpreting sūtras was introduced to Tibet in the massive commentary on the Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra by the Korean master་་Won-ch'uk.  However, this is almost entirely ignored in Chinese Buddhism as well which seems to generally follow the Tientai school for dating and evaluating sūtras.

Madhyamikas would never accept this scheme since they regarded the Saṃdhinirmocanasūtra a provisional sūtra from the get go, and their criteria for evaluating definitive vs. provisional sūtras comes from the Akṣayamtinirdeśasūtra.

But this is all massively off topic.

Malcolm wrote:
Sociologically, in Tibetan society, Ngakpas fill the role taken by Brahmin priests in Indian society.  The reason for this is that the rise of Buddhist Tantra in Indian involved lay and ordained Buddhists competing with Brahmins in the same roles, officiating at burnt offering rites, and so on. We can, for example, find sustained arguments by Indian Buddhists for why Buddhist burnt offering rites are more effect then their brahmanical counterparts.

That said, there is very little market for the skills of Ngakpas in the West, and I doubt there will ever be much of one. I don't think, in the context of Western Buddhism, we are ever going to see many Ngakpas in traditional gear. There will always be some, but not many.

That said, some people find it helpful to wear robes when they practice -- but this is really no different than Zen people who like to wear Zen gear when they practice —— it sets a tone, a mood, a purpose.

Personally, apart from not cutting my hair, I don't really hold much with wearing Ngakpa gear. Putting on and taking off special clothes to practice Dharma just seems a bother to me. But then, I am very lazy. I have, however, been known to wear a stripped robe on special occasions.

Malcolm wrote:

Ignorance and knowledge are respectively suffering and the absence of suffering.

The teaching of definitive meaning as expounded in the third turning is aimed at the position of the fourth noble truth, whereas all the nondefinitive scriptures (of the first and middle turning) discusses only the three noble truths, though they know the words of the fourth noble truth, they don't know the meaning.

Refering to my post in 2011 in talk.religion.buddhism:

Due to lack of the four non-obstructions, there is obstruction to the law, meaning, words and speech. The lack of four non-obstructions is the four inversions. The four inversions are due to the practice of the three purities (renunciation of self, desire/pleasure, impurities of the 2 vehicles)

T12n0376_p0862a18(11)║「此三種修於我法中亦無實義，間間苦修性昇降故，苦樂 想顛倒，"These three practices do not have real meaning in my teaching, due to continue practice of renunciation, the nature arises and fall, the thought of suffering and pleasure become inverted."

The three purities and their corresponding inversions:

T12n0376_p0862a19(01)║樂苦想顛倒，無常常想顛倒，常無常想顛倒，
"The thought of pleasure and pain is inverted, the thought of impermanence and permanence is inverted, the thought of permanence and impermanence is inverted,
T12n0376_p0862a20(01)║非我我想顛倒，我非我想顛倒，不淨淨想顛倒，
"The thought of non-self and self is inverted, the thought of self and non-self is inverted, the thought of impurities and purities is inverted,
T12n0376_p0862a21(00)║淨不淨想顛倒，如是四顛倒想者不識平等，
"The thought of purities and impurities is inverted, such is the four inversion which does not recognize the equanimity."

The three practice of purities have no real meaning, meaning is not gained, the gained is not the meaning. Thus, the gained is obstructed, the not gained is non-obstructed.

The position of mahayana is to accept the words of the 11 classes of sutras (include the 2 vehicles) which preached the gained, but neutralize words of these scriptures with the meaning that is not gained as preached in the vaipulya class of mahayana scriptures (方等大乘經典).

Further:

The sutra passage about the suffering is of the three dharma seal:

The practice of the three purities (renunciation of self, desire/pleasure, impurities of the 2 vehicles). The three poisons, desire, aversion and delusion support each other, the three dharma seal, no-self, suffering, and impermanence support each other. The three poisons, the three dharma seals and the four truths relate to each other. The five senses and the thoughts are considered as impured, thus there is antidote like visualization of corpse, thinking of impermanence of phenomena.

All these elements belong to the 25 gains, the gained has no meaning, and so it lead to obstruction due to inversions.

Anyway, right now, as far as I understand right now: the Sautrantika definition of the dhyanas was pretty much accepted at least in the Mahayana world. Modern Theravadins who also try to go back to the sutras, as the Sautrantikas did in their time, came up with pretty much the same understanding of the dhyanas, such as Geoff in his post here. Geoff quoted some interesting examples from the Pali Canon illustrating the vitarka, vicara etc which I find more illuminating than the Kosa definition. Do you think that his outline there is accurate from a Mahayana PoV?

Again, one needs to experience these things personally. As Dzogchen practitioners, we are supposed to gain experience in everything. As to yourt question, Geoff's analysis is fine and matches more or less what I can find in the sūtras and tantras (where these factors are also discussed at length in the commentaries).

MiphamFan said:
OK, thanks.

I would love to read more Mahayana commentaries on the Dhyanas and shamatha, but it seems that what is available in English is not as detailed as Theravadin/Pali versions. There was an Indian English translation of Bhavanakrama 1, but the translator does not write very lucidly IMO. I know that Theravadin lineages seem to be mostly a reconstruction (I posted that old thread back on VC after all), but I find stuff like Geoff's analysis interesting because he cites interesting quotes from the Pali canon itself and seems to draw similar conclusions to the Sautrantikas (maybe because he himself has had Mahayana teachers?)

For example, he cites these examples for vitarka and vicara from the canon that I find quite helpful: Just as when a man sees someone approaching in the distance he does not yet know whether it is a woman or a man, but when he has received [the apperception] that “it is a woman” or “it is a man” or that “it is of such color” or that “it is one of such shape,” then when he has thought this he further scrutinizes, “How then, is he ethical or unethical, rich or poor?” This is examination. With directed thought he fixes. With examination he moves about and turns over [what has been thought].

And just as a winged bird first accumulates [speed] and then accumulates no more [speed when gliding], so too, directed thought is like the accumulation, and evaluation is like the outstretched wings which keeps preserving the directed thought and evaluation....

Directed thought is like a text-reciter who does his recitation silently. Evaluation is like him simply contemplating it.

Malcolm wrote:
Personally, I don't like directed thought and evaluation, but that is just a translation choice. In the Mahāyāna commentaries. they are generally glossed as a course and subtle attention. One point of difference is that the first Dhyāna for us (Sautrantikas, etc.) has no vitarka after one pointedness is reached. It maintains vicara however, because in the first Dhyāna one can still change one's focus.

Correct, physical pain can be felt by someone who has knowledge of the basis, but who is not residing in a moment of unfabricated consciousness.

Physical pain cannot be felt by someone who is residing in the dhyānas or who is in a state of perfect śamatha. In this case, the only difference between a perfect śamatha and "instant presence" is whether that person has Dzogchen view or not. Dzogchen is many wonderful things, but it does not eliminate the framework of how karma functions, how mental factors function, and how śamatha functions and so on. Some people (not you) seem to think that Dzogchen is a "get out of Buddhism free" card. It isn't.

The reason I referenced ChNN's medical issues last year is that some people think that Rinpoche is in instant presence 24/7/365. He isn't, by his own admission.

Yes, rig pa is used in many different ways in Dzogchen texts. In this case, rig pa refers one's continuum of unmodified consciousness that is momentary. Hence "instant presence." In this case rig pa is referring to the knower, rather than a kind of knowledge as it is used in other contexts.

It basically means that when you are in this state, mental factors associated with pain of the body have no means of arising.

And in context of this discussion do not see why a practitioner on the path could not experience both regardless of it being a sensation or feeling or something else. Am I completely wrong in this?

Malcolm wrote:
There are five sensations and only five: pain and pleasure for the body; sadness and happiness for the mind, and indifference for both.

The answers to so many of these questions are found in Abhidharma.

Aryjna said:
Are there two different definitions of rigpa? Or is the only difference between a buddha and someone who has a much lower capacity that the person of lower capacity will become distracted when the pain starts?

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, rig pa is used in many different ways in Dzogchen texts. In this case, rig pa refers one's continuum of unmodified consciousness that is momentary. Hence "instant presence." In this case rig pa is referring to the knower, rather than a kind of knowledge as it is used in other contexts.

It basically means that when you are in this state, mental factors associated with pain of the body have no means of arising.

And it is a fact that prior to that war, no one lived here because it was too dangerous due to the long standing conflict between the Pocumtuc and Mohawk tribes. Indeed, tensions were sufficiently high that the Pocumtuc tribe built elaborate fortifications with palisades and ditches to (unsuccessfully) fend off attacks from the Mohawks.

Well, no this is a misrepresentation of US history.

All of the founders from the south were indeed slaveowners. Most of the founders from the North were not.

With respect to murdering Indians, at that point in history, Indians and Europeans were murdering each other with equal frequency, as we can see in the French-Indian war. By this point (1756), the 1.5 million people in the British colonies had expanded no further than the Appalachian mountains, inhabiting the 100-300 mile strip of land area to the east of them from the Carolinas to what is now Maine, only about a tenth of the total landmass of N. America. Beyond that it was all Indians until the Pacific. Of course, then there is the fact that people like Franklin consulted with the Iroquois Confederacy about their principles of governing, some of which were adapted to the new constitution.

The part of Massachusetts in which I live, the hills west of the Connecticut river, was uninhabited by the 17th century because of the constant wars the Pocumtuc confederacy had with the Mohawks who lived in the Hudson Valley. When the first European settlers arrived in 1764 in Ashfield, my town, there was literally no one living here or anywhere around. The whole Berkshire region was uninhabited because of the constant warfare the tribes of the Connecticut river and Hudson Valley were waging against each other for generations before Europeans arrived. Also smallpox definitely took its toll on the local tribe. Their remnant survives as the Abenaki Indians of Vermont.

Grigoris said:
I see that the rationalisation based on the legal concept of terra nullius is happily applied by the offspring of white colonialists in America too.

Malcolm wrote:
I am not rationalizing anything. These are the facts. Eastern Forest Native Americans, unlike Europeans, did not have a concept of property. Instead, they had a concept of usufruct. Their wars were frequently over who had the right to use a given tract of land. Ownership just did not occur to them. However, the tribes fought many brutal wars with each other that had nothing at all to do with European colonialism.

They further thought the European concept of "property" was very strange, since they had a slash and burn type of agriculture and land management strategy. Thus, they also thought the European practice of growing plants in animal manure was disgusting.

In short, at least in New England, there was a total lack of understanding on both sides.

To your point about Terra Nullius, the Pilgrims and others of their era were pretty much steeped in ideas of divine mandate -- they did not assume, after they landed, that New England was unpopulated, they imagined themselves Israelites, as is show in this introduction to Increase Mather's account of King Phillip's War:

Grigoris said:
That the Heathen people amongst whom we live, and whose Land the Lord God of our Fathers hath given to us for a rightfull Possession, have at sundry times been plotting mischievous devices against that part of the English Israel which is seated in these goings down of the Sun, no man that is an Inhabitant of any considerable standing can be ignorant.



Malcolm wrote:
My point is that because of a long standing war that preceded the English occupation of New England, the region in which I lived was in fact a no man's land, (not in the sense of terra nullius, but because it was too dangerous to live here prior to the end of the French Indian war) between Pocumtuc and the Mohawk tribes. So, the point here is that in the eyes of settlers, the Americas were not terra nullius, as Cook declared of Australia, but rather, it was land bequeathed by God to the "English Israel," meaning Puritans.

Hobbes notes:

Grigoris said:
And though a People comming into possession of a land by warre, do not alwaies exterminate the antient Inhabitants, (as did the Jewes,) but leave to many, or most, or all of them their Estates; yet it is manifest they hold them afterwards, as of the Victors distribution; as the people of England held all theirs of William the Conquerour.

Malcolm wrote:
Locke, coming later, deals with the notion of individual property as a function of labor rather than conquest:

Grigoris said:
Sect. 30. Thus this law of reason makes the deer that Indian's who hath killed it; it is allowed to be his goods, who hath bestowed his labour upon it, though before it was the common right of every one. And amongst those who are counted the civilized part of mankind, who have made and multiplied positive laws to determine property, this original law of nature, for the beginning of property, in what was before common, still takes place; and by virtue thereof, what fish any one catches in the ocean, that great and still remaining common of mankind; or what ambergrise any one takes up here, is by the labour that removes it out of that common state nature left it in, made his property, who takes that pains about it. And even amongst us, the hare that any one is hunting, is thought his who pursues her during the chase: for being a beast that is still looked upon as common, and no man's private possession; whoever has employed so much labour about any of that kind, as to find and pursue her, has thereby removed her from the state of nature, wherein she was common, and hath begun a property.

Malcolm wrote:
Locke also addresses the limitations of usufruct:

Grigoris said:
Before the appropriation of land, he who gathered as much of the wild fruit, killed, caught, or tamed, as many of the beasts, as he could; he that so imployed his pains about any of the spontaneous products of nature, as any way to alter them from the state which nature put them in, by placing any of his labour on them, did thereby acquire a propriety in them: but if they perished, in his possession, without their due use; if the fruits rotted, or the venison putrified, before he could spend it, he offended against the common law of nature, and was liable to be punished; he invaded his neighbour's share, for he had no right, farther than his use called for any of them, and they might serve to afford him conveniencies of life.

Malcolm wrote:
And his attitudes towards the peoples of the Americas, here:

Grigoris said:
Sect. 41. There cannot be a clearer demonstration of any thing, than several nations of the Americans are of this, who are rich in land, and poor in all the comforts of life; whom nature having furnished as liberally as any other people, with the materials of plenty, i.e. a fruitful soil, apt to produce in abundance, what might serve for food, raiment, and delight; yet for want of improving it by labour, have not one hundredth part of the conveniencies we enjoy: and a king of a large and fruitful territory there, feeds, lodges, and is clad worse than a day-labourer in England

Malcolm wrote:
.

Now, Locke's ignorance of Natives in America is of course staggering. But his attitudes reflect the general 17th and 18th century attitudes towards the Americas, and indeed, his understanding of the cultures of the Americas is one of the main points upon which he hangs his conception of the state of nature.

Naturally, in Buddhadharma we also have the idea of a state of nature, the origin of government when someone takes more than their usufruct rights should allow them, indeed in this there is much in common between the Aggañña Sutta and Locke's notions of the evolution of the property from labor, and the evolution of the state from the need to protect that property.

Could someone comment on how tremendous physical pain (such as gout or a kidney stone) would be experienced if one were to be able to be in instant presence during that moment?

My understanding is that this would be like any other experience except potentially more difficult. You would have the sensation of pain in the body and thoughts and feelings would arise relative to that experience but in instant presence they would dissolve as you observed them. You wouldn't be just disassociating from the body or "tuning it out".

You would still feel the pain but wouldn't be chasing after the experience and making it worse.

Horrible pain like this sucks but its also seems like an opportunity to practice and have a concrete experience. Perhaps like Rushen

Anyway, right now, as far as I understand right now: the Sautrantika definition of the dhyanas was pretty much accepted at least in the Mahayana world. Modern Theravadins who also try to go back to the sutras, as the Sautrantikas did in their time, came up with pretty much the same understanding of the dhyanas, such as Geoff in his post here. Geoff quoted some interesting examples from the Pali Canon illustrating the vitarka, vicara etc which I find more illuminating than the Kosa definition. Do you think that his outline there is accurate from a Mahayana PoV?

I think the Dārṣṭāntika (Sautrantika) opinion is the best.

See the Abhidharmakośabhāṣyam, vol. 4 pp. 1229-1236.

So no, there is no blackout of physical sensation until the third dhyāna.

Admittedly I am a new Buddhist(only slightly >1yr), but have been going ard different teachings in order to decide which to follow in the end.
Though if not for the fact that the local DC gar got disbanded last year, very likely I would follow ChNNR's teaching mostly by now. Right now I am with the Chokling tersar local grp(focusing on ngondro for now),also receiving teaching from other rinpoche,such as Jigme Lodro Rinpoche and non-Nyingma Rinpoches such as Jhado Rinpoche.

The six liberations are liberation through sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mind.

The last is for practitioners, the others are for non-practitioners.

If you are a serious Dzogchen practitioner it is 100% guaranteed that you will attain buddhahood either in this life, the bardo, or the next life (in the nirmanakāya buddhafields if you do not find time to practice much in this life but possess the instructions and understand them) depending on your diligence. If you are not so serious, but have faith in Dzogchen teachings, than it is certain you will obtain buddhahood within a few lifetimes.

Why do I say this? It is because this is what is said in all of the six major commentaries we have on the 17 tantras, as well as what is said in the 17 tantras themselves.

Hi Malcolm,

Thanks for your answer.  But, sorry, my question wasn't really clear.

When I spoke of "lack of consensus", I was referring to the "raging debate" in the Theravada world about dhyana / jhana:
"light / soft / sutta jhana" vs. "hard / deep / visudhimagga jhana" etc...

As per Alan Wallace's interpretation of Asanga, Tsongkhapa & Co. the commentarial tradition in Mahayana is pretty much in line with that of Theravada, i.e. 1st dhyana is said to be really deep & blissful state of absorption that can be unwaveringly and seamlessly sustained for 24 hours  etc...

Is that your understanding as well ?

Thanks for your input.

Malcolm wrote:
The most salient characteristic of the first dhyana is it can be entered and dropped at will. Since both vitarka and vicara are absent in the second through the fourth, when one attains those, one remains in them for as long as one intends at the outset.

The first dhyana still retains mental activity.  I can't really evaluate Wallace's ideas frankly because I was not trained that way.

The extent to which the average American’s tax burden varies based on his or her state of residence represents a significant point of differentiation among state economies. But it’s only one piece of the puzzle.

What if, for example, a particular state can afford not to tax its residents at high rates because it receives disproportionately more funding from the federal government than states with apparently oppressive tax codes? That would change the narrative significantly, revealing federal dependence where bold, efficient stewardship was once thought to preside.

The idea of the American freeloader burst into the public consciousness when #47percent started trending on Twitter in 2012. And while the notion is senselessly insulting to millions of hardworking Americans, it is true that some states receive a far higher return on their federal income-tax contributions than others.

Just how pronounced is this disparity? And to what extent does it alter our perception of state and local tax rates around the country? WalletHub sought to answer those questions by comparing the 50 states in terms of three key metrics. Read on for our findings, expert commentary and a detailed methodology.

When Rinpoche accepted invitation by other group in Singapore for a Guru Rinpoche's retreat programme, she became jealous, quarrelled with some people who attend the other programme and it maybe the eventual cause that she quarrelled with Rinpoche later.

cyril said:
Yes, I'm aware of that but I somehow I find it strange for a terma text to use some slang terms based on an European perspective. I heard that the redskin term derives from the now-extinct Beothuk people from Newfoundland which the Europeans encountered in their early stages of colonising North America and which used to paint their skin with red ochre. Later, the term was apparently extrapolated to all the other Native tribes despite the fact that most of them did not share that red ochre skin-painting custom with the Beothuk. So, I don't know, but somehow I find it hard to believe that Padmasambhava could have chosen this particular identifier for the Native American populations.

Perhaps at the time the text was written, people in that region spoke a language substantially different than Tibetan.

When Rinpoche discusses "contemplation," he most frequently resorts to an example from the Samadhirāja Sūtra which maintains that a second of samadhi purifies more karma than eons of merit based practices.

All sentient beings have samadhi, it is what they so with it that determines whether they continue in samsara or achieve awakening; there are mundane samadhis and transcendent samadhis and so on.

The whole issue that I am trying to understand is 'how did scientific materialism become a substitute for religion?' It's really not a simple thing to understand. The Secular West is the expression of a conditioning process which unfolded over millenia and has arrived at a state of  - let's see  - false consciousness. So I'm trying to understand how that happened, and I've read quite a bit on this subject. The 'rise of nominalism' is one component.

Malcolm wrote:
The secular west is a natural consequence of the Scottish Enlightenment. In particular, it can be traced to the popularity of the rediscovery of Epicurean atheism in the writings of Lucretius's De rerum natura:


Wayfarer said:
Whilst human kind
Throughout the lands lay miserably crushed
Before all eyes beneath Religion- who
Would show her head along the region skies,
Glowering on mortals with her hideous face-
A Greek it was who first opposing dared
Raise mortal eyes that terror to withstand,
Whom nor the fame of Gods nor lightning's stroke
Nor threatening thunder of the ominous sky
Abashed; but rather chafed to angry zest
His dauntless heart to be the first to rend
The crossbars at the gates of Nature old.
And thus his will and hardy wisdom won;
And forward thus he fared afar, beyond
The flaming ramparts of the world, until
He wandered the unmeasurable All.
Whence he to us, a conqueror, reports
What things can rise to being, what cannot,
And by what law to each its scope prescribed,
Its boundary stone that clings so deep in Time.
Wherefore Religion now is under foot,
And us his victory now exalts to heaven.

Malcolm wrote:
Deism was merely a polite name for 18th century atheists, and the term "nature's god" is just a term used for natural laws of physics and the like:

RATH: So can you tell us - back in 1776, what did nature's God refer to?

STEWART: So nature's God is one - a deity that operates entirely through laws - natural laws - that are explicable. And we have to approach this god through the study of nature and also evidence and experience. So it's a dramatically different kind of deity from that you find in most revealed religions.

These commentaries are written to be read together with the text it's commenting on, which makes reading them out of context a bit harder. I'll need to go back to the original sutra to do a decent translation - may be a while before I have time to do that, though, at this time of the year. But the comments specifically on the 十惱亂 aren't particularly revelatory, mostly says that avoiding them assists your practice.

Invokingvajras said:
That's insightful. Personal experience would prove this to be rather true, though I can't help but wonder if it's full application would only be possible if one were ordained a bhikṣu.

fuki said:
Yes and no (for me) for instance seeing dependent origination in everyday life (so not intellectual study) is a spontaneous observation or seeing which compared to the study of DO the doctrine is useless, it's the dharma of prajna. But as a Ch'an practisioner I also see many ppl holding "right view" according to the doctrine but yet are completely stuck in a loophole of their own narrative, right isn't always right if you catch my drift. I enjoy discussing with Malcolm we had some interesting encounters on E-sangha but then I left and resided on ZFI only, Malcolm is very learned indeed much more then I will ever be. Wrong view is the obstacle for sure, but right view can be just as much an obstacle, if the view is merely intellectual.

Malcolm wrote:
There are two kinds of right view: mundane right view and transcendent right view. The latter arises from the former. There can be a problem if a person mistakes their mundane conceptual right view for the transcendent right view of realization. For this reason we need genuine teachers who can set us straight if we err in mistaking our conceptual right view for the right view of realization. But people like Adyashanti are so far away from anything remotely resembling right view, well...you know what I think. On the other hand, people like Adyadhanti, Andrew Cohen, Eckart Tolle, etc. are not for serious people. They are for people who like spiritual fast food. Even though I think they contain errors, the study of real Samkhya, Yoga, Vedanta is a serious thing which I respect greatly, even though I think their view is mistaken.

Just as presence is an expression of being, so too is being an expression of the Infinite.  The Infinite is ultimate Reality, and is beyond all conceptualizations and experiences. It is the ultimate ground of all being, all existence, all dimensions, and all perceptions. It is transcendent of all categories, all descriptions, all imaginings. It is beyond ego, self, presence, being (and non- being ), and oneness, but it is not other than these either. Neither conceivable nor experienceable, the Infinite knows itself through a simple intuitive regard it has for itself in every aspect of itself.  Thus the only thing that realizes the Infinite is the Infinite. And only such realization brings an end to the mind’s restless search for God, Truth, and meaning.

His one-page memo makes it clear that marijuana possession and distribution is against federal law, and it will direct U.S. attorneys to approach these cases as they do all other cases when enforcing them.

The move now injects uncertainty into the growing industry in the regions of the country that have legalized the drug, CBS News' Jeff Pegues points out. Many are likely to be confused about whether it's okay to grow, buy or use marijuana in states where it's legal, since long-standing federal law prohibits it.

Malcolm wrote:
Observing that it may be a compassionate outcome for a person to spend some time incarcerated for a crime they have been convicted of is a far cry from praying for someone's incarceration.

Why would it be compassionate? In order to prevent them from committing other similar crimes. As I observed, however, Sogyal has yet to be brought up on criminal charges. The way it works in a Democracy is that everyone is entitled to their day in court. Jane Doe had her day and opted for payment rather than punishment, probably because her lawyer advised her to take the settlement rather than get bogged down in a lengthy court case with a less than certain outcome.

I'm saying a long-life prayer for Sogyal so he can spend a bit of that time in prison. This would be the best and most compassionate outcome for him to help ripen that huge back log of negative karma, and good for the victims of his abuse too, to see some justice done.

Johnny Dangerous said:
You are just using a vague idea of justice to rationalize a desire that someone be harmed. You should apply antidotes, or whatevet your approach dictates, instead of pretending a desire for vengeance is somehow motivated by virtue. The punitive end of the criminal justice system in most countries has little to do with ' facing up to criminal  behavior', whatever it's other qualities or deficiencies.

Malcolm wrote:
It all depends on whether you have a one-lifetime view or a multiple lifetime view. If someone has faith in karma, the vipāka of sexual misconduct and so on is very clearly delineated. Wishing for someone to suffer, for any reason, is antithetical to Buddhist ethics in general, and Mahāyāna ethics specifically, since it involves abandoning one's compassion for that sentient being. One cannot in the same breath say, "I want to X to suffer in prison for their crimes" and say also, "I have compassion for X." No truly compassionate Buddhist person ever wants any sentient being to suffer for any reason.

TRC said:

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, no one ever said pṛthagjana Mahāyāna practitioners were perfect.  Anyway, you will have to be satisfied with the endless humiliation of Sogyal in the press and on boards such as these since it is highly unlikely he will be successfully brought up on charges. Being satisfied with the humiliation of a sentient being is also not very Buddhist.

We can address the issues of patriarchy and sexual abuse in Buddhist organizations without indulging in afflictive behavior ourselves, or at least we can recognize the afflictions that the perceived misdeeds of others raise within ourselves.

And if you accept rebirth, do you really believe that in some past life you have not done things far more awful to women than the crimes you impute onto  Sogyal? I am pretty sure we have all been perps and victims, over and over again...

The answer is not to rush to punishment. The answer is to raise the awareness of would be Dharma students. To encourage caution when approaching teachers. To take our time. To keep our eyes and ears open fully.
I am not interested in victim blaming, but it is a fact that Sogyal's reputation was widespread long before the scandals were in the public domain.
That did not help those already in the organisation where a different set of dynamics apply..but could have been a warning those thinking of joining.

Josef said:

His behavior, and his apologists behavior removes them from the ranks of Mahayana practitioners.

Thank you Josef. That was exactly the point.

While I generally agree with Josef, on this point, I cannot agree. Papayin Māra's attempt to trick the Buddha by taking the bodhisattva vow to gain access to the Buddha's presence resulted in Papayin Māra's prediction to complete Buddhahood (Śūraṅgamasamādhi Sūtra), so it is impossible that Sogyal has been separated from the Mahāyāna gotra. You, TRC, are underestimating the tremendous merit of the bodhisattva aspiration.

His five guidelines for practitioners are always:

1) Ati Guru Yoga.
2) Use presence and awareness.
3) Work with circumstances.
4) Do your best.
5) Relax.

Johnny Dangerous said:
I didn't mention a particular stance, other than that the Buddha (obviously) had little to say about modern sexual politics or ideas. I don't  really feel like pulling anything up from access to insight because I'm on a mobile device.

Obviously though, if you are looking for Pali sources it is a mostly very dim view of sensual pursuits period, promiscuity would certainly fall under that, but the approach is so different from modern moralizing about it that there is no comparison really. That, and the fact advice on  sex for celibate renunciation is obviously it's own deal.

The Buddha In Pali sources takes a negative view of household life period, that ain't no 'family' values.

Mahayana sources are all over the map...so exactly what kind of 'source' are you looking for?

Shore up your own ability to steer the conversation and be specific before complaining about not having sources etc.

Your thirteenth year would be the next bird year, that would be your obstacle year. Your 7-off side year would be the next rabbit year, which is the enemy of bird, another obstacle year.

With the exception of the prohibition against intoxication, the wording of the first four precepts are identical for laypeople and ordained. Since there is a qualifying proviso for novices and bhikṣus that clarifies that killing animals is a far lesser offense, and because in the commentaries on Vinaya "abandon taking life" refers specifically to human beings, we can understand that the first precept refers to killing humans.

As I wrote above, the killing of animals is covered under the general commitment to ahimsa we take on as part of going for refuge to the Dharma.

So, if you kill an animal, you may not have broken the first precept, but you have breached your commitment of ahimsa.

The issue is not what you personally accept and reject. The issue is how the first precept is to be understood for lay people. While it is commonly understood to include animals, it doesn't. This does not make killing animals acceptable.

Grigoris said:
I disagree.  This may show that killing of animals is not considered as serious as killing humans, it does not show that killing animals is not included in the First Precept.  If it meant that then it would not require confession, if it was okay to kill animals, it would not require anything at all.

Anyway, for me, not being a monastic and all, the Vinaya is not my sole source of moral/ethical standard.

Malcolm wrote:
Why would the Buddha have a higher standard for lay people than for bhikṣus and novices? That does not make any sense. And no one said it was "ok." However, in the Vinaya, masturbating is a much more serious downfall than killing an animal —— requiring not only confession but temporary censure by the Sangha. This punishment means that you are put in isolation, and if you meet someone, you have to tell them what you did. By contrast, if you have killed an animal, you merely confess that  you have done so at Posadha and the offense is purified without any further punishment or notice. Harming plants is the same level of downfall as killing an animal, BTW.

I have kind of skimmed scattered Dharmakaya references in various books, the "richest" of which was one volume by D.T. Suzuki. The notion continues to be mysterious to me, and I was hoping that some readers on here could refine a few points that are puzzling me.

My understanding is that the Dharmakaya is the most inclusive, "first" Buddha Body. It is unknowable to the human intellect and is manifested more "palpably" in the other two Bodies.

The Dharmakaya is not God, a god, or a divine Creator, yet it is described as the primal source of everything. Do I have this correct? Because if It is "the" Source, would It not also be the causal factor for Samsara and Samsara's associated limitations and sufferings?

Even if the Dharmakaya is not a creator, but is nonetheless "the Source", how is its activity explained, if not by creation? Does it express itself in, or as, a kind of serial "Emanation" as in the Kabbalah's conception of the Ein Sof, or in Gnosticism's conception of emanations derived from the Pleroma?

Just when you thought it was safe to go back into the shrine room, along comes another eye watering revelation. This time it is not Sogyal – but one of his close buddies, a teacher from the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism known as Namkha Rinpoche. He runs an outfit called Rigdzin which has centres in several European countries including Spain, Switzerland, the Netherlands and France. Namkha’s career follows a similar pattern to Sogyal’s – unsavoury rumours about his sex life have circulated within diaspora Tibetan Buddhism for many years. And some people have expressed doubts about his qualifications as a lama. Now one brave woman has blown the whistle about her experiences with Namkha – a horror story of exploitation and sexual abuse. This woman, who wants to be known as Tar, was close to Namkha for many years. Her story is corroborated by another individual who also wishes to remain anonymous. Their real names are known to me. Here Is Tar’s story. It was translated from French into English by Peter Robinson and edited by Mary Finnigan. The original French version is available on request.

At the end of 2005 I attended my first teaching in Lausanne given by NR. It was the Four Noble Truths. At 47, I was still looking for answers and this teaching made me want to go deeper.

NR spoke in Tibetan and was translated by a close student. The more advanced students dressed as ngakpas wearing the robes of Vajrayana practitioners. NR presented himself as a Tibetan refugee and a tulku. He is ngakpa, with a wife and 2 daughters.
The question of taking refuge in the 3 jewels and in addition the tantric vows was put to me. I wasn't informed that I would have to accumulate 100,000 prostrations and recite the refuge prayer 100,000 times. Until then I regularly practised recitations and prostrations. I was introduced to chine meditation sessions, which I found beneficial. Up until then, NR showed a peaceful appearance and presented himself as the father lama protector.
Everything changed when I received a call from NR who proposed to me to do a secret tantric practice in order to pacify my mind. I answered that it scared me and that at the same time I wanted to have a calm mind. I vaguely understood that I would be alone with him. He hastened to say that it was not because I was a beautiful woman but a sensitive being that he wanted to bring on the path of enlightenment.

I waited several months before giving him an answer. One day, I got a phone call from NR: he said that he had separated from his wife and had no idea where to sleep... I suggested he contact his secretary but she lived in an apartment right next to NR's wife. I was searching for a solution because I didn't want to invite him to my home, so I rented a room at an inn for him and we met there.

I helped him to settle into the room, then I suggested he should go to eat with the other guests, which he refused. He prepared food in the room and I ate with him in silence. He asked me to stay, saying he had to get up the next day at 4 am to go to see a Lama friend.
Suddenly, without any warning, he began to kiss me. He smellled very bad as if he has not washed for several days. It was an animal sexual relationship in which I had no role. He mumbled prayers in Tibetan and then remained in meditative position with an erection. He asked me to wake him up at 4 o'clock. I was so shocked, not understanding what happened. I did not close my eyes that night, I was in a state of semi stupor, which I believed to be a beginning of a state without thoughts.

When he woke up, he told me not to tell anyone what happened, otherwise a demon would take possession of me.
I continued to frequent the Buddhist centre. In 2008 the community lived on donations from participants, all quite modest financially (I gave 200 francs per month, plus flower offerings, and most of my free time outside my work as a nurse to severely disabled people). The committee and the lama planned to bring HH the Dalai Lama to Lausanne in 2009. A financial guarantee was required in case of cancellation of the event. I had a little money in an account after my divorce (22 years of life together and 3 children). I committed the sum of 25,000 Swiss francs, with the blessing of NR. 
I remember that NR gave a lecture, he was drunk and told the assembly that we were all bad people ... It was already starting to worry me at that moment. The commercial side of the event was also aimed at bailing out the Rigdzin Centre’s finances.

I started to be part of "lama care", the service to the lama doing admin duties during retreats and teachings. It was hard but I did not complain about this slave job. I had to promise not to create discord --- there were many tensions. That's when I discovered that "secret practice" was offered to almost all women in the community. Some left because they were afraid. Only one of them refused because she was married.
If my memory is good, I received another phone call from NR that year. I had to get him by car from his house and bring him to mine. This time it was a degree above the first experience. Still no clear teaching, but a kind of "bad sex party". But Yeshe Tsogyal offered her body, did she not?
Strangely, NR's wife knew nothing about Dharma, she was just a figurehead.

Then NR asked me to become the girlfriend of a half brother of his wife, with the intention that I married him so that he could get his papers. When I discovered the situation, I ended the relationship with the half brother. He was not practising the Dharma and was mocking me.
NR decided to find me a partner in the person of his tailor. What a horror, I measure 1 meter 73 and this little Tibetan was just 1 meter 50. I saw him once and he told me all his misery, his visits to prostitutes, his divorce. I cried partly out of compassion a little out of disgust. I made it clear to NR that it was over.

In 2010, my 87-year-old mother was at the end of her life. She had a strong faith in life, she was a strong and kind person. She was not a Buddhist but appreciated the Dalai Lama. I was looking forward to practising with her. She died on the day a lama was invited to the Rigdzin Centre. He taught powa ...and prayed for my mother (I had goose bumps, this lama was genuine and full of true compassion). His name is Ayang Rinpoche. Of course, my mother was cremated according to the protestant ceremony with just close family there. She passed over in peace.
Shortly after her death, NR asked me for money for the prayers that were made for her in monasteries in Tibet. I am not used to giving money for prayers, for me a prayer is a gift. However, I ardently hoped that my mother would be accompanied in the bardo. 
I discovered a sum of 5000 francs in a box that she left at the bank for me. So, I went with the 5000 francs in cash to see Rinpoche. Oddly, he said "It's a big sum, give it to my wife" I will never know if this money went to the monks or if it was used for the luxurious expenses of his wife. All the mattered to me right then were the 49 days of prayer for my mum.

At the end of the 49 days, I went back to see NR and humbly asked him if he knew where my mother has taken rebirth. His answer shocked me, he told me that he didn't know my mother and could not see how she had reincarnated. The positive side of this great lack of compassion is that I still practised and I promised myself that if one must go to hell for having compassion for her, then I will go with or without NR's blessing.
I also experienced the following in 2010

I drove the translator's girlfriend to Drolo Ling, the Rigzin Centre in the south of France. NR gave an initiation. In the evening I went to sleep in a dormitory with thin walls between each room. To my surprise NR and Rinchen, the president of the French centre entered the "box" next to me. They did not know I was listening, but I heard a conversation in English (NR speaks basic English).
What I heard is beyond my comprehension. Rinchen offered girls from ... 16 years old to NR for practices. The 2 men described them: they are beautiful. ... they were laughing. They are virgins ...

I spoke to the translator's girlfriend that I was shocked because at 16 they are minors in France! She did not take me seriously and I kept that to myself. I have a daughter who was 22 years old at the time and one day NR asked me: Will you give me your daughter?? I told him that I do not make decisions for her and that she would surely not agree.

I have more facts dating back to 2011. I was off work with a broken knee and I thought I would spend a few days at the Rigdzin residential centre Namkha Dzong in southern Spain. I slept in the corridor and almost every night NR made me go up to his room when the others slept. He was brutal, I was in pain but could not scream. I had bruises on my breasts and he pushed his fist into my vagina, which bled. That day he made fun of me asking me in front of other men: Isn't it true that you do not have sex? It was humiliating!

Back in Switzerland I had a gynaecological check. For the first time in my life I had a papilloma virus. My immune system defences were low. I followed a treatment and consulted a therapist. She understood everything and I could talk to her about what had happened.

At this point my body was weakened. I convinced myself that I wanted to continue practising for sentient beings. My poor knee did not allow me to do my daily practices. I could not sit in lotus anymore. One day I was doing my prostrations in the temple when NR surprised me with a cushion to soften my prostration. He made a point to all the practitioners that a student who was using a cushion and had to start her accumulations all over again. I had painfully reached 75,000 prostrations. I came out in tears and learned that if I left once again I would be thrown out of the sangha.
At that time, we were going to receive special teachings. Some students who gave a lot of money were exempted from finishing their practice, I found it unfair, and I told NR about it and he told me that I would have teachings later. One student went and NR said she had maintained a vow of silence for 3 weeks. I said I did not believe it, and he again threatened to throw me out.
So, started the work of psychological destruction: I was the worst, I made him ashamed.I thought to myself that I would not let him throw me out. I will just leave!

I have taken ngakma vows. I remember that NR said that he had forgotten to give me them earlier and that his wife had interceded on my behalf. So, I put on the red and white zen. I remember being uneasy when I had to kneel at the feet of Rinpoche sitting on his throne, like an animal that surrendered. I also told the translator that I had a papilloma virus and that I thought I had caught from him in secret practices. I wanted a little compassion for myself and for all women who exposed themselves to contamination (never a condom). He told me that if I caught HIV it would have been better for me because then there would have been danger. I was nauseated. I said to him: Would you say the same thing if it was your girlfriend who was infected? I was disgusted. He trivialised the situation.

A little incident happened to me the night of taking ngakma vows. I made the water offerings in the temple and there were lots of of small burning candles. It was necessary, as usual, to hurry up. My brand new zen caught fire. Fortunately, I was able to extinguish the flame and not burn myself
I started to avoid going to the annual retreats that took place in Switzerland in Evolène in the canton of Valais. The last retreat I did, I rented a hotel room to avoid having to sleep in a dormitory. (I slept with an insomniac practitioner and his dog, with a practitioner plugged into a respirator, I did not sleep, I even slept on a carpet in the temple).

I decided to make an appointment with NR in his office in Lausanne. It was almost impossible to have an interview without the translator's presence.
I told NR that I had a papilloma virus and that I was certainly not the only one. I told him, with compassion, that he would do well to watch over his wife. (I had learned not long ago that she had been hospitalised for "gynaecological problems.") His wife had undergone a procedure to remove pieces of vaginal mucous that could degenerate into cancer. He said he was going to talk to her.
I said in my polite way that I found these practices dangerous to women's health. I explained to him that it is men who transmit the virus but do not experience any symptoms.

I have stopped following the teachings. I regularly received messages from NR for a few months. He said to me "I was kidding, I'm not going to kick you out, come back because you also worked a lot for this Buddhist centre, take advantage of what you gave" He also added, "You are my dharma darling, I love you, come back ..." I told him that he was my root lama and not my dharma darling. At that time many practitioners left Rinpoche and the sangha.
Rinpoche's secretary is the only one who tried to contact me. He knows a part of my story. He does not agree with these secret practices but at the same time he is not ready to directly oppose NR.

To this day, only one practitioner who has left the sangha, and who is a lawyer, has offered me her support if I testify about the things I saw in Rigdzin and with NR. She offered to confirm several occasions when NR spoke about me with contempt in front of the sangha.
One day in 2015 I received a message from the translator. He stated that I should not come back to Rigdzin, He asked me to resign. I told him I would prefer to go before a public meeting to explain the reason for my absence. I never heard from him in response.
My intention is not to blame NR. I only want to shed light on his actions.
I want to heal and continue to practise kindness for all beings as an ordinary person. Then I will be able to help other women to heal.
I believe that the feminine energy is more than ever necessary for the planet, and for humanity, and I will struggle so that it is preserved and honoured.

I'd like to request some further clarification.

I would assume the term often translated as "unmanly men" refers to the five classic descriptions of the pandaka. If anyone happens to have a copy on hand, I'm curious what terminology is used specifically in the Sanskrit or Chinese versions of the text. Perhaps female pandakas would fall under this category as well.

Bishamon's (Vaisravana) rank as the most powerful of the four kings is also likely due to his role as king of the north. Says independent scholar Michael D. Gunther: "In Chinese cosmology, still familiar today as 'feng shui 風水,' north is the most dangerous direction, such that dwellings (including the palaces of the Tang and Heian emperors) are built facing in the opposite direction (south). It follows that the Guardian of the North must be the leader of the other directional guardians, and that he must carry the most powerful amulets -- namely, the relics of Buddha's own body -- in order to defend against the malign northern influences. In a practical sense, the north was considered the 'bad' direction for at least two reasons: agriculturally (in the northern hemisphere), the sun is in the south, and therefore a southern exposure is most desirable, and a northern exposure is least desirable (all gardners and farmers know this, even today); and in terms of geopolitics, the Mongol peoples of the north, against whom the Great Wall was built, presented the greatest danger to China throughout much of its history.

But this has nothing to do with the Indian legends surrounding Vaiśravana, where the south is regarded as the pernicious direction, associated with Yamarāja.

Vaiśravana is associated with horses and horsemen in Uttarakuru, the northern continent, as well as Guhyakas, a kind of yakṣa who love treasures and secrets.
