I think Sherab Dorje raised an interesting issue some time back that I'd like to bring us back to:  the question of whether or to what degree the tulku system as developed in Tibet offers an efficient way to identify and train teachers and leaders when resources are scarce.  Thoughts on this?

Malcolm wrote:
Not necessarily. Two major schools of Tibetan Buddhism do not operate this way: the largest, Gelugpa and as well as Sakya.

The Gelugpas appoint their leaders and teachers through education, not tulku lineages, with the notable exception of the Panchen Lama, who is the head of Tashi Lhunpo monastery. The Dalai Lamas are not monastic heads, but actually part of the Drepung Monastic system.

The leadership of Sakyapas is held in the Kohn family lineage. The abbocy of Ngor (a subsect of Sakya) is circulated among the scions of four families. It is only in the smallest of the Sakya subsects, Tshar, and Eastern Tibetan Sakya monasteries where tulkus play a significant role in the leadership of monasteries.

The leadership of Mindroling likewise is held in an old family, and is not tulku based.

Anyway, this practice only applies to qualified people from whom one has received empowerment into a highest yoga tantra mandala. If you have not received such an empowerment, then there is no reason to follow this practice.

But the point is that there is a sufficient amount of corruption in the system to call the whole system into question. As long as there is no clearly defined criteria by which a tulku may be recognized, then I am afraid it is just a matter of faith whether one accepts someone as a reincarnation of a master or not.

This is why I bring up the examples of NKT. For example, according to them, <redacted> is Sakya Pandita's reincarnation. According to your logic, since this is the opinion of Trijiang Rinpoche, I should accept it, or at least not dispute it. Can't you see how crazy your point of view is? according to your point of view, I should accept that a worldly spirit is the reincarnation of one of the most important Sakya masters.

All the Longsal teachings of Namkhai Norbu are called "upadesha" in their name, although they display many different methods. Not to name all, but there are very different ones, like Mandarava with it's Tsa Lung, not a Dzogchen teaching in itself maybe; Saltong, combining Tsa Lung, Semdzins etc; Todgal, and so on.

And what about a teaching like "The Upadesha of Introduction to the State of Ati", which has a method from Semde, but then explains also Tregchod?

Thanks for clarifying.

Not only that, but you are equally asserting that Tai Situ is wrong not to accept HH Karmapa, Thrinly Thaye Dorje, as being the real Karmapa.

ChNN did not believe in his own status as a tulku for many years.

He only accepted that he was the tulku of Adzom Drugpa later on in life based on some circumstances.

The reason why I accept that ChNN is an actual reincarnation of Adzom Drugpa has to do with those circumstances — primarily, ChNN wrote a commentary, and later on, when he finally got a copy of Adzom Drugpa's collected works, he found a text identical to the one he had written himself in that collection, the same for over a hundred folios. He explained all this in 1992 at the first SMS retreat at Tsegyalgar.

Further, the master that recognized him as the tulku of Adzom Drugpa was his own uncle, the one who attained rainbow body, not Yeshe's predecessor.

But the tulku system is just religious politics, completely and totally worldly in my opinion.

While this is true, at the same time, this does not mean that one does not view other teachers with pure vision too.

Malcolm wrote:
I did not judge anyone as a false incarnation. In other words, for example, I have no faith in the two Karmapas as incarnations of the 16th Karmapa. But my lack of faith in them as reincarnations has no bearing on whether they are the actual incarnations of the 16th or not. Just to clarify, I have 0 connection with the Karma Kagyu lineage, for whatever reason, just like I have 0 connection with the Gelug lineage.

As far as pure vision goes, if someone has the idea that even one person is not a fully awakened buddha, their vision is not pure. So, if we are going to take about pure vision, we really need to be clear what we mean.

I have no obligation to regard teachers other than my own as Buddhas. I am not even obliged to have pure vision of them (other than the same we try to imagine all sentient beings are buddhas in the context of the universe as a buddhamandala). I have no obligation to regard people who are not my teachers as anything more than ordinary worldly people with no special qualities worth mentioning.

I wouldn't say 100%.  Having talked to a tulku and seen and read some accounts it seems to be more than just faith.  Some do display specific/extraordinary qualities.  Of course there is nepotism and (like I said) politics involved, which means that there it also has a strategic component, thus we are talking about a deviation from the ideal of faith.  That in itself means that it is not 100% faith.  There is some cunning in there too. Plus, of course, other more objective factors.  Maybe even some virtue.

Procedure meaning a process done by some or many experienced lamas who investigate and either reject or confirm it?

Yes? No?

Sherab Dorje said:
Procedure like:  This lama is responsible for making the final decision regarding candidates, in the event that this lama is not in the position to make the decision, then the responsibility lies with this lama, etc...

Or:  A candidate will be considered valid on the basis of this, this and this criteria, if they do not satisfy the aforementioned criteria then they will not be eligible...

Procedure.  You see there is property and wealth involved too, many times, not just a title.  Or the future of a lineage may depend on the "right" candidate being found.  So, as we all well know quite well, whenever money, wealth and power comes into things then politics arise.  Since they are bound to arise, if there is a set procedure (which there isn't) then this acts as a check to the politics.  Even if there are politics involved, if there is a procedure in place then at least the politics are executed in a relatively smooth and conflict-free fashion.

But there is no set procedure, and intuition is a little difficult to verify objectively.  And anyway, just because two (or more) intuited results conflict, doesn't mean that all of them are incorrect.

These two quotes lead me to consider a subject that I've pondered a few times before: the differences in recognitions of lamas reincarnations. I recall this matter has come by a few times before but I can't remember which cases exactly.

Anyway, my main question is, based on these two messages below as well as other similar cases, that there are disagreements on recognitions of the reincarnations. My intention is not to argue about this but to analyse why do these disagreements exist?

Thanks for the input all.

In my case, I'm working on a Dakini sadhana (sorry, can't say which one) which includes visualization of the 21 Taras around the periphery of the central Dakini. The text says to visualize the 21 Taras in terms of color, hand implements, expression, etc. clearly and precisely but doesn't say how exactly. When I asked my Teacher Who gave me this practice which of the various versions of the 21 Taras to use, He said to use this one. That's what spurred my OP.

When I did Yumka Dechen Gyalmo, I was not given this lay-jor of the 21 Taras. I hope some day to receive it in the context of Yumka.

One of the reasons that Sanskrit titles are included at the beginning of Tibetan translations of Indian texts is to remind the reader of the kindness of the translators.  This notion seems to be lost in the fray of these discussions about the cost of Dharma books.   Elizabeth Callahan has been working on this book for years and people are talking about how much profit can be made selling bound up copies of ink on paper.  That shows very little understanding of the value of the work.  Of course, none of this would even get to the point of being published if there wasn't a sponsor supporting her.  In fact, that's why all those books are available in Tibetan, because sponsors took it upon themselves to have them printed and made available for a nominal price.  Even TBRC is funded by sponsors.  So all this talk about things being free or available is all because of somebody else footing the bill.  So rather than complaining about the costs of books like this, maybe you should appreciate how cheap it really is.  What's dinner and a movie cost these days?   Is that really worth more to you than being able to read the scriptures of your chosen religion?

Malcolm wrote:
Right, but the issue here is not cost, it is restrictions vs. lack of restrictions, and the reality is that restricting books is a little fatuous.

Personally, making books like khrid ye shes bla ma and so on expensive automatically restricts them. Setting a high price for important tantric texts is a more effective strategy than making people fill out questionnaires and signing oaths.

Anyway, as I already pointed out, well trained students will not purchase books for which they do not have transmission/permission.

The reason why these books are available in Tibetan is because the Tibetan Buddhist Lineage Heads want these books out there so that they won't die. Every book on TBRC has a database entry through which any text can be restricted by tradition of they so choose. There are many books on TBRC that in fact are restricted by tradition.

When Tibetan lineages send books to TBRC they do so knowing full well that they are openly making these texts available.

Now, Sherapa has brought up the point of samaya — and this is a valid point. If you are a practitioner, and take lineage seriously, it is better to get permission to read this or that text if you are interested in it. This is the proper approach. On the other hand, a text like Zabmo Nangdon is a general text on tantric anatomy, so in fact anyone who has received HYT empowerment is qualified to read it.

Even then, the Shambhala "restriction" pages are kind of ludicrous because anyone can just lie if they want to get the book.

I agree with Jikan that it is fraught with danger to use a Kagyu master's teachings in response to a Soto Zen teacher, as they are coming from different initial assumptions and often different terminology. The (apocryphal?) story of Hashang Mahayana, the Ch'an monk who debated with Vajra masters and lost, is a great case in point when two traditions meet but not much contact takes place. Another one is the case of Kalu Rinpoche and Seung Sahn.

Malcolm wrote:
The Samye debate was not a debate between Vajrayāna masters and Hashang. Kamalashila was debating a strictly sutrayāna point of view grounded in standard Indian Mahāyāna. Not all Tibetans agree that Kamalashila won the debate either.

If you want to read a Dzogchen master's treatment of 8th century Northern School Chan, then you need to read Nubchen Sangye Yeshe's "Lamp of the Eye of Dhyāna". One of the interesting things about this text is that it cites scores of Tibetan Chan masters, not just Chinese masters.

Well, not so fast, Kiomosabe, for one thing, the type of Chan Tibetans were exposed to was a Northern School variant. It is very hard to make a case that 10th century Tibetan doxologies apply to the Vajrayāna influenced Zen of the Kamakura period, or even Sung Dynasty Chan.

Secondly, Nubchen makes it very, very clear that while Chan (as known in Tibet) follows the definitive Mahāyāna sutras, it is not as direct or efficient as Mahāyoga, and addresses the seeming contradiction here inso far as the fact that Chan is supposedly a "sudden" path, where as Mahāyoga is gradual. And of course, he clearly places Atiyoga as the pinnacle of all.

Third, the idea that one can "realize" Dharmakāya without achieving full buddhahood is somewhat absurd. Sure, we call the emptiness aspect of the mind "the dharmakāya" of the basis, but this does not mean we have realized the result dharmakāya even though there is no substantial difference between the dharmakāya of the basis and the dharmakāya of the result.

It is very interesting to examine Nubchen's detailed and nuanced arguments.  It is true that Thuken wrote about Chan in 18th century China, but he dismisses it as Yogacara in a short summary fashion. While it is true that Longchenpa and Jigme Lingpa comment briefly on Chan, there is no Tibetan whose treatment of the Chan/Gradualist debate is more authoritative than Nubchen's.

Content:
Dan74 said:
A good point. The trouble is, as I see it, that most of the time it is not so much akusalacittas, but habitual mental patterns that occupy our minds. The technique of mindfulness is to help us break out of these habits ans attend to the matter at hand with complete attention and a fresh seeing.

Malcolm wrote:
Dan,

One, we have to make a distinction between sṃṛtī and sṃṛtyupasthāna. The former is a mental factor, the latter is "Close placement of mindfulness", familiar to us as the four foundations of mindfulness.

Secondly, sṃṛtī is always accompanied by saṃprajāna, i.e. attentiveness. These two always work in a pair.

The point is that we cannot have a mind where kusalacaittas and akusalacaittas are present at the same time -- it's impossible

This is why even simple exercises of mindfulness, the mundane kind, are useful. For example, mindfulness it is often described by the Buddha means when eating one knows that one is eating, when walking, one knows that one is walking, when wearing pangs, one knows that one is wearing pants. Before you can have "right mindfulness" of the kind that TRC is describing, you have to develop mindfulness.

But more to the point, when you have the presence of the mental factor of sṃṛtī, the mental factor of vīrya, diligence, is automatically present. Why? Because the kusalacaittas always work in company, where one is found all the other nine are to be found as well.

Moreover, when the ten kusalacaittas are present, it is impossible for the akusalacaittas to arise in the mind, including the three afflictions referenced above. So therefore, as long as one is mindful and attentive  even in an ordinary way, this eliminates the possibility for the akusalacaittas and the afflictive cittas to arise.

So the answer to the question is, uy understanding how mind and mental factors function the motivation to practice mindfulness arises merely by understanding how the mind works and taking opportunity of this knowledge. It does not have to be this formal, academic, intellectual trip.

Of course there are different objects of mindfulness, but the act of being mindful is the same in so far as it is a mental factor associated with all positive minds. Mindfulness is always beneficial, since it is a kusalacaitta. This does not make mindfulness profound however.

The point here of course is to point out that we are always being mindful of something, unless of course we are distracted by the akusalacaittas,, etc.

Hi,
One thing bothers me a lot lately & that is the lack of a continuous motivation to practice mindfulness.
It bothers me that I am distracted most of the day & too lazy to do anything about it.

I imagine that this is normal & motivation becomes more continuous as we continue to practice. On the other hand, I've experienced sudden rises in
determination as far as other things are concerned (e.g., finding a solution to a problem that remained unsolved for too long).

In the case of practicing mindfulness more consistently, it feels to me that a simple insight of some sort may be missing...
I'm curious have you ever had any breakthroughs or insights that helped you get into gear in the practice of mindfulness? Could you kindly share with your experience?

The practice of Dzogchen has the ability to eradicate the two coarse obscurations [i.e. the obscurations of affliction and knowledge] even in ordinary practitioners below the path of seeing because it permits ordinary practitioners to encounter their real condition even though they are not what one would be normally considered "enlightened" [i.e. the path of seeing/the first bodhisattva stage and beyond].

The path of Dzogchen is really quite extraordinary precisely because of its benefits for normal, everyday people.

Of course, one still must continue to practice and attain awakening in order to deal with the two subtle obscurations which remain.

When you wake up in the bardo, you also generate emanations. Maybe I am one of those.
In terms of the rainbow body, whether it's attained at death or afterwards in the bardo/a pure nirmanakāya buddhafield, is that a mark that a practitioner has entered on the Bhumis or is it a mark that one has attained full Buddhahood? Does awaken mean realized or enlightened - and are those two terms describing different things or not? My understanding, which is likely to be incorrect, is that "realized" meant a person was at least on the 1st Bhumi, while "enlightened" would mean full Buddhahood. Your insight would be appreciated.

MOSCOW (AP) — A top pro-Russia rebel commander in eastern Ukraine has given a bizarre version of events surrounding the Malaysian jetliner crash — suggesting many of the victims may have died days before the plane took off.

The pro-rebel website Russkaya Vesna on Friday quoted Igor Girkin as saying he was told by people at the crash site that "a significant number of the bodies weren't fresh," adding that he was told they were drained of blood and reeked of decomposition.

The Malaysia Airlines Boeing-777 was shot down Thursday, killing all 298 people aboard. The plane was flying 10,000 meters above an area where Ukrainian forces have been fighting separatist rebels. Each side accuses the other of downing the plane.

U.S. intelligence authorities said a surface-to-air missile brought down the plane, and U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power told the U.N. Security Council in New York on Friday that the missile was likely fired from a rebel-held area near the Russian border.

Girkin, also known as Strelkov and allegedly a former Russian military intelligence agent, said he couldn't confirm the information. But it's sure to add to the intense emotions surrounding the crash, with the rebels accused of shooting down the plane.

Girkin said "Ukrainian authorities are capable of any baseness."

He claimed that a large amount of blood serum and medications were found in the wreckage.

Navy Missile Downs Iranian Jetliner

By George C. Wilson
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, July 4, 1988; Page A01
A U.S. warship fighting gunboats in the Persian Gulf yesterday mistook an Iranian civilian jetliner for an attacking Iranian F14 fighter plane and blew it out of the hazy sky with a heat-seeking missile, the Pentagon announced. Iran said 290 persons were aboard the European-made A300 Airbus and that all had perished.

"The U.S. government deeply regrets this incident," Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Pentagon news conference.

The disaster occurred at mid-morning over the Strait of Hormuz, when the airliner, Iran Air Flight 655, on what Iran described as a routine 140-mile flight from its coastal city of Bandar Abbas southwest to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, apparently strayed too close to two U.S. Navy warships that were engaged in a battle with Iranian gunboats.

The USS Vincennes, a cruiser equipped with the most sophisticated radar and electronic battle gear in the Navy's surface arsenal, tracked the oncoming plane electronically, warned it to keep away, and when it did not fired two Standard surface-to-air missiles.

Navy officials said the Vincennes' combat teams believed the airliner to be an Iranian F14 jet fighter. No visual contact was made with the aircraft until it was struck and blew up about six miles from the Vincennes; the plane's wreckage fell in Iranian territorial waters, Navy officials said.

Iranian vessels and helicopters searched for survivors, but there was no indication last night that anyone survived what apparently is the sixth worst aviation disaster. Iranian television broadcast scenes of bodies floating amid scattered debris.

It was the first time any U.S. military unit had shot down a civilian airliner. It occurred almost five years after a Soviet fighter pilot shot down an off-course Korean Air Lines Flight 007, killing 269 people.

Iran accused the United States of a "barbaric massacre" and vowed to "avenge the blood of our martyrs."

President Reagan in a statement said he was "saddened to report" that the Vincennes "in a proper defensive action" had shot down the jetliner. "This is a terrible human tragedy. Our sympathy and condolences go out to the passengers, crew, and their families . . . . We deeply regret any loss of life."

Reagan, who was spending the Fourth of July holiday at Camp David, said the Iranian aircraft "was headed directly for the Vincennes" and had "failed to heed repeated warnings." The cruiser, he said, fired "to protect itself against possible attack."

News of the downing of the plane began with sharply conflicting accounts from Iran and from the Defense Department of what had transpired in the Persian Gulf. Early yesterday, Tehran broadcast accusations that the United States had downed an unarmed airliner.

The Pentagon at first denied the Iranian claims, declaring that information from the fleet indicated that the Vincennes, equipped with the Aegis electronic battle management system, had shot down an attacking Iranian F14 jet fighter. But after sifting through more detailed reports and electronic intelligence, Reagan directed the Pentagon to confirm there had been a tragic case of mistaken identity in the war-torn gulf.

Crowe, in his hastily called news conference at the Pentagon, also backed up the skipper of the Vincennes and faulted the Iranian airline pilot. Crowe said the Airbus had flown four miles west of the usual commercial airline route from Bandar Abbas to Dubai and that the pilot ignored repeated radioed warnings from the Vincennes to change course.

Why and how the Vincennes mistook the bulky, wide-bodied Airbus A300 for a sleek, supersonic F14 fighter plane barely a third the transport's size will be the subject of "a full investigation," Reagan promised. A military team under the command of Rear Adm. William N. Fogarty of the U.S. Central Command will leave this week to begin that investigation, Defense Department officials said.

The shootdown of the Airbus represents the biggest loss of life on the strategic waterway since the U.S. warships began escorting Kuwaiti tankers in and out of the Persian Gulf last July. Pentagon officials then said the increased U.S. naval presence would have from a "low to moderate risk" of provoking confrontations with Iran.

But in the past year, although the United States and Iran are not in a formal state of war, there have been a series of brief but fierce sea battles in the gulf between the two countries' military forces. Vigilance and readiness among U.S. forces intensified after the near-sinking of the patrol frigate USS Stark by an Iraqi fighter-bomber on May 17, 1987, in a missile attack that killed 37 sailors.

Yesterday started out as another sea battle, and ended with what the Vincennes commanders misinterpreted as a "Stark profile" attack on the high-tech cruiser. Crowe in his briefing and other Navy and Defense Department officials offered a detailed version of how the shoot-down occurred.

At 2:10 a.m. EDT, the Pentagon said, three Iranian Boghammar gunboats fired on a helicopter that had flown off the Vincennes on a reconnaissance mission. The helicopter flew back to the cruiser unscathed. The Vincennes and a smaller warship, the frigate USS Elmer Montgomery, a half-hour later closed on the gunboats and put them under fire with 5-inch guns, sinking two and damaging the third.

At 2:47 a.m. EDT, the Iranian Airbus with almost a full load of passengers took off from Bandar Abbas, a big Iranian naval base on the northern coastal elbow of the Strait of Hormuz. The field at the base is used by civilian and military aircraft and recently had become the center for Iran's dwindling force of F14s, a twin-engine, two-place fighter that the United States sold to Iran during the rule of the shah.

Two minutes after the Airbus took off, the far-reaching radars of the Vincennes Aegis cruiser saw the plane was coming its way. The skipper of the ship, operating under liberalized rules of engagement that call for U.S. captains in the Persian Gulf to fire before being fired upon to avoid another Stark disaster, warned the approaching aircraft to change course, according to the Pentagon.

The Vincennes and most airliners are equipped with identification of friend or foe (IFF) electronic boxes that query each other across the sky to establish identities. The Vincennes' IFF questioned the Airbus IFF via telemetry, but received no response. A response would come in radio pulses that would be deciphered and displayed as an identifying number on the ship's combat information center consoles.

Failing to raise the Airbus by IFF, the Pentagon said, the Vincennes broadcast its warnings by voice radio, using the emergency UHF and VHF channels that aircraft crews would hear if they followed standard practice of monitoring those frequencies. Crowe said three warnings were sent over the civilian emergency channel and four over the military one, called "Guard." The Pentagon said the Vincennes could have issued the warning over the air traffic control channel but did not.

"The suspect aircraft was outside the prescribed commercial air corridor," Crowe told reporters. Defense Department officials said later that the Airbus was four miles west of commercial air corridor. "More importantly," Crowe continued, "the aircraft headed directly for Vincennes on a constant bearing at high speed, approximately 450 knots."

Without becoming specific, Crowe said there were "electronic indications on Vincennes" that led the U.S. crew to conclude the approaching airliner was an F14. "Given the threatening flight profile and decreasing range, the aircraft was declared 'hostile' " at 2:51 a.m. EDT. The airliner at that crucial moment was on a course of almost due south, 185 degrees, and descending toward the Vincennes from an altitude of 7,800 feet, according to Crowe. Visibility was no more than five miles, Crowe said.

Three minutes later, at 2:54 a.m. EDT, the Vincennes launched two Standard surface-to-air missiles from its deck. The missiles whooshed toward the twin-jet airliner, which was nine miles away and not visible to the naked eye because of the haze hanging over the gulf. The Standard missiles homed in on the heat of the quarry's engines and at least one of them exploded when it pulled abreast of the Airbus. Such a missile hit usually slices an aircraft apart and turns it into a fireball of burning fuel.

"At least one hit at an approximate range of six miles," Crowe said. "We do have some eyewitness reports that saw the vague shape of the aircraft when the missile hit, and it looked like it disintegrated."

Asked if the Vincennes' skipper had been prudent or impetuous by firing at a plane he could not see, Crowe replied: "The commanding officer conducted himself with circumspection and, considering the information that was available to him, followed his authorities and acted with good judgment at a very trying period and under very trying circumstances . . . . Not only was he following this aircraft and concerned about it," but he also "was engaged on the surface with Iranian units."

Crowe said it was "logical" for the skipper to assume an aircraft that was coming down from the sky at high speed and would not respond to radio warnings was putting the Vincennes "in jeopardy."

At another point in the news conference Crowe broadened his defense of the Vincennes skipper, declaring "the No. 1 obligation of the commanding officer of a ship or units are the protection of his own people. We deeply regret the loss of life here, but that commanding officer had a very heavy obligation to protect his ships, his people. We've made that clear throughout the Persian Gulf mission . . . . "

Crowe, who used a chart of the Strait of Hormuz that displayed the approximate positions of the vessels and the route of the airliner, said he did not have enough data to explain fully why the multiple kinds of detection gear aboard the Vincennes mistook a wide-bodied jetliner for a fighter.

But he noted that the Vincennes' radar was focused on a plane coming at it head-on, reflecting a smaller dot on the console screens than would be the case from a side view. Also, he said, no Air Force Airborne Warning and Control System (AWACS) or Navy Hawkeye sentry planes were aloft over the Strait of Hormuz to provide additional identification data to the Vincennes at the time of the shootdown.

Navy leaders said Iranian commercial aircraft had flown over U.S. warships in a threatening manner at least eight times before the Stark was hit by two French Exocet missiles fired by an Iraqi jet. Ever since the Stark attack, skippers in the gulf have been less tolerant of such apparent threats.

Asked if the skipper of the Vincennes would have held his fire under the interpretation of the rules of engagement followed before the Stark was attacked, Crowe replied: "I don't know. Certainly the rules of engagement would not have been as specific as the authorities granted him." He said another review of the rules of engagement would be part of the general investigation of the shootdown.

Crowe said there were "fundamental differences" between the actions of United States in this incident and the Soviet Union in the downing of Korean Air Lines Flight 007, which strayed into Soviet airspace on the night of Sept. 1, 1983, during a flight from Alaska to Japan. The Soviet airspace was not a war zone like the Persian Gulf, Crowe said, "and there was not combat in progress" as was the case yesterday. "It was at very high altitude" and no Soviet warnings were issued.

"In the Persian Gulf," Crowe said, there is very little time or maneuver room when ships are put at risk. "We're fighting in a lake."

But more importantly here on fora, there are clearly people seem to spend an inordinate amount of time arguing over the doctrine, which I suspect is detrimental to other aspects of practice, would you agree? So I was simply trying to say that there isn't one uniquely correct way of looking at this. That's all.

Malcolm wrote:
I have found that arguing about things between lineages is not productive, say Chan and Highest Yoga Tantra, or even between Kagyu and Sakya, for example.

Why? Partially it has to do with the way different schools perceive themselves. If you tell a Chan practitioner that Chan is not the apex of buddhadharma, they will think you are crazy. If you tell a Vajrayāna practitioner that one can attain Buddhahood by common Mahāyāna in less than three incalculable eons (and that includes Chan), they will think you are crazy. Similarly, if you tell Theravadins they are following Hinayāna they get all offended and huffy. If you try to insist to Vajrayānists that Theravada does not fall under the criteria of what we define as Hinayāna, you will get blank stares.

On the other hand, if one wants to go and understand why Chan considers itself the apex, or why Vajrayānists consider Theravada Hinayāna, and so on, then one should do so with an open mind.

Then of course there is the issue of conflicting assumptions — a lot of long time Mahāyānists and Vajrayānists, as we know, claim to unconcerned with the assertion that their texts and so on are not really products of Buddha speech as traditionally defined (that is spoken, by permission, or blessed). This also raises complexities. Then there is the difference of canons -- for example, frequently Chinese Buddhists will cite the Shurangama Samaadhi 2, for the sake of convenience. This sutra, whether authentic or not, simply is not read in the Tibetan Canon and so therefore, will not be felt of much authority by Tibetan Buddhists. It is certain that it existed, but unlike many other sutras, for whatever reason, the Tibetans chose not to translate it into Tibetan because perhaps they doubted its authenticity.

Then of course there is the modern pro-atman interpretation of the Dharma, grounded far more in the Coomaraswamy, Grim, and modern early 20th century authors, than traditional discourse, AFACT, represented by our own Son of the Buddha, and elsewhere, Zenmar (aka Ardent Hollingsworth), who right or wrong, represent a vocal minority on virtually every Buddhist forum I have been on in the past 20 years.

Finally, there are the out and out "Buddhist" skeptics such as the Triratna Order's Jayarava Atwood and Richard Hayes. What possible interest they have in Dharma anymore is totally beyond me, since people like they seem bent on tearing Buddhism down completely, but whatever. They seem to emanated out of the forensic trend of Buddhist historical scholarship, but of what use this is for the practice of Dharma is totally mystifying.

All of this leads to a rather complex maze of issues and assumptions one has to navigate on a heterogeneous forum such as this. And most people do not have the long view I have, since they  have not participated on these forums of and on. How many folks remember alt.buddha.short.fat.guy?

Really?  Coz I am sure that it would have some precedent in tantra.

Malcolm wrote:
It has no precedent in sutra or tantra. You can listen to ChNN state this quite clearly today since you do not believe me. The Tulku system started with Karma Pakshi.

Sherab Dorje said:
I seem to remember a couple of predictions by Guru Padmasambhava being thrown around.

Malcolm wrote:
The tulku system has no precendent in sutra and tantra. Yes, in the Mañjuśrī mulakalpa there are some predictions of rebirths of bodhisattvas in Tibet such as Gampopa, and in the Padma Khathang there are lists of predictions about where this terma is concealed and by which of the 25 disciples it will be revealed in a later incarnation, and so on, but there is no precedent for system of reincarnated lineage heads like you have in Nyingma and Kagyu exclusively. The fact that it is not bound by some canonicity is why there can be disputes over the recognition of the Karmapa, for example. There is no clear guide in sutra and tantra which regulates how reincarnations are recognized/selected, trained, appointed, succeeded and so on. For this reason then, the recognition of Steven Segal as a minor tulku generated some controversy in the West. Many people really could not and still cannot understand why he was recognized by Penor Rinpoche — it was not for money, I can guarantee that. Since it is not really a part of sutra and tantra, the recognition of tulkus merely boils down to the opinion of this or that master. If someone follows that master, they are likely to give credence to the reincarnations he recognizes.

Sherab Dorje said:
So who has the say about the orthodoxy of the tulku system then?  Who's orthodoxy (tradition) are we going to follow?

Malcolm wrote:
[/quote]

The tulku system is an embedded feature of Tibetan culture, religious life, politics and economics, but it is a deeply ingrained custom, it is not a system which is grounded in sutra and tantra. That being said, it is an integral feature of many lineages in Tibet such as Gelug (Drepung, Ganden, Sera), Drikung, Drugpa, Karma Kagyu etc., Palyul, Khathog, Dorje Drag, Dzogchen, Shechen and so on, as well as Dzongsar, as well as Bon monasteries also.

Thus, even though the tulku system does not have the orthodox and canonical backing of say bodhisattva vows or samaya, it is a deeply embedded part of Tibetan religious culture, and at this point, I would say Tibetan religious culture could barely function without it, which is why the Chinese are so keen on regulating it.

Unfortunately, due to the highly subjective nature of recognitions, it is difficult to say there is an "orthodox" position on the issue of recognitions. Sometimes reincarnations are recognized in dreams, sometimes, by divinations, sometimes, as in the case of the Dalai Lamas of late 18th and 19th centuries, by drawing lots; sometimes by predictions of the dying Lama like the 13 Dalai Lama or the 16th Karmapa (if you follow Tai Situ's version), etc. Sometimes by tests, and in the case of 5th Dalai Lama, even though he failed the tests, the regent proclaimed to the Kashag that he passed them all and successfully recognized the belongings of the 4th.

The buddhology of tulkus is still being worked out by Tibetans. The only books I know that attempts to work out this buddhology is Tulku Thondup's INCARNATION: The History and Mysticism of the Tulku Tradition of Tibet. It is an attempt, but I have to say, it is a little scanty. There is also Enthronement: The Recognition Of The Reincarnate Masters Of Tibet And The Himalayas. This book makes it eminently clear that the rite of enthroning a tulku is basically the same as the rite of consecrating a statue.

Usually planes don't suddenly explode in mid air with debris falling down, so I think we can rule out the crash theory.

As for being shot down, that's the only legible solution. And that Ukraine would shoot down the plane makes no sense. However, we do know that pro-Russian separatists are in the area where the plane crashed, we do know that they have issued warnings before that they consider the airspace above where they are located as theirs, and we also do know that they have bragged about having BUK missiles in the past. These are just the kind of missiles you need to shoot down a commercial airliner, which has an altitude that is far beyond what "regular" missiles (which what most rebels and terrorists are in possession of) have.

This cached link shows the pro-Russian separatists in that area tweeting an image of the BUK missiles: https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/ ... 7629018112 " onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;  -- and I say cached, because they have now deleted that image.

And earlier today, on Russian social network VKontakte (a sort of Russian Facebook), a leader of the pro-Russian separatists bragged about having shot down a Ukrainian military plane over the exact same town as the Malaysian airliner crashed down into. There has been no Ukrainian military plane crashing down there today, only the Malaysian airliner - ergo it was a misunderstanding of gigantic proportions. This post on VK have since been deleted...

And now US intel confirms that indeed a missile have been fired at the airliner: "A senior U.S. official said one radar system saw a surface-to-air missile system turn on and track an aircraft right before the plane went down.  A second system saw a heat signature at the time the airliner was hit, the official said. The United States is analyzing the trajectory of the missile to try to learn where the attack came from."

The pro-Russian separatists are now intending on sending the discovered black box of the airliner to Moscow.

This is a tragedy that easily could've been avoided if people had made the right choices. And I really do wonder what Putin is thinking right now...

It does not mean of course that anyone should be expected to accept Vajrayāna, or for that matter Mahāyāna, but criticisms of these traditions should not be allowed.

In general. DW should be a forum devoted to the promulgation and positive growth of Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna. How can that happen if we allow random people to engage in slanderous criticism of Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna? Somehow it is a major sin to refer to Theravada as a Hinayāna school, but no one blinks even once when the authenticity of Mahāyāna sutras and tantras are questioned or even denied.

Malcolm wrote:
Classically speaking, debate in Dharma is meant to clarify one's understanding of Dharma because one wants to understand the Dharma with more precision. The purpose of debate in Dharma has never been to fault Dharma teachings and replace them with some post-modern revision. But because of the way we conduct political discourse in the West, we extend that to religious discourse. Then because we have this idea of "free speech", we are offended by the notion that some lines of conversation might be considered non-virtous from the perspective of Dharma. In other words, we constantly confuse political speech with Dharma speech thinking that it should be the kind free for all we might find in the Hyde Park Speaker's corner.

What I am pointing out is that this "open dharma" forum violates the very TOS of DW by its very nature because of the kind of speech that is built into the forum itself. As I mentioned before, it provides a natural platform for adharma.

Classically speaking, in ancient India, debate was lead by qualified masters who taught students how to think more clearly and precisely about the Dharma. It has never been a free-for all as we find here. The purpose of this debate was to lessen the students' conceptual doubt and to sharpen their thinking. But that does not happen here. Mostly, it becomes the default forum for what are essentially non-virtuous discussions.

In ancient India, if tīrthikas wanted to debate with us, they were sent to the gatekeepers, expert Panditas like Naropa, etc., whose job it was to debate all comers, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist. Well, we don't have that kind of capacity here. We are not a Buddhist university. There are no panditas here.

In the end, the goal should not be to have lots of users, or lots of controversial conversations. The goal at DW should be to have meaningful, edifying discussions about Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna Dharma.

Well, it is pretty easy to see which kinds of arguments are not appropriate in this or that forum. For example, if a Theravadin comes to the general Mahāyāna forum and claims that the Mahāyāna sūtras were not taught by the Buddha, well, this is inappropriate. If a Mahāyani goes to Dhammawheel for example, and insists that Mahāyāna sūtras be accepted as Buddha's speech, they will be laughed off the forum.

But if you a forum devoted for the sole purpose of debating the very validity of Buddha's teaching, what use does this serve but to further Adharma. For example, the Buddha did advise us to check his teachings the way a goldsmith checks gold, but not because Buddha doubted that what he was teaching was gold. He knew that his teachings were gold. So when we are checking the Buddha's teachings for its "gold content", we are doing so because we want to find gold, not because we want to find pyrite. But the way that kind of forum works is that we begin from a posture of no trust, we assume from the outset than what we are being handed is pyrite, and not gold. We then spend all of our energy in trying to prove this shiny substance in our hand is not gold, and even when we find out it is not pyrite, still we are not sure it is gold. This is the incorrect way of understanding the Buddha's teaching on testing his doctrine like a goldsmith tests gold. Even more to the point, when it comes to Vajrayāna, you had better make damn sure you have already decided the teachings are gold, because after you enter Vajrayāna, if you decide the teachings are not for you, then you can have real problems and obstacles.

Moreover, such a forum just gives a safe haven to those who harbor all sorts of wrong views about the Dharma in general, and Vajrayāna and Mahāyāna in particular. In a free for all zone, no one can prevent someone from slandering Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna. This forum, the "Open" Dharma forum, is just such a haven. While not all the threads in this forum are pernicious, there a great number that are very pernicious for one reason or another. It is because of the nature of the forum that this is so.

It is much better to have received the reading transmission of the Dharma text you wish to follow so that you have a living connection with that teaching. There are many Dharma texts you really are not allowed to read without such transmission. There are many Dharma texts that have one to one transmissions.

For mantra, it is indispensable to have the reading transmission, in other words, you cannot successfully practice any mantra without first having received the lung, the sole exceptions being the mantras of Avalokiteshvara, Tara, Mañjuśri, Śakyamuni and some others.

It is important to make time to spend attending one's guru. But you do not have to spend your life doing so. Even so, serving the guru is an important part of practice, and the fastest, most excellent way to earn merit.

In reality all a guru can do is show one the path. There is nothing a guru can do more than that. There is nothing you can do more than receive their transmission and practice. You practice, and when you have questions, you ask. That's it. His or her job is to give transmission, your job is to apply transmission and realize what they have realized.

Again, as I pointed out to James, this is really not what HHDL says, which is why I disagreed with the statement, "as written and as presented". But of course people who do not actually read what HHDL says tend to naively present this citation much in the same way as the Kalamas Sutta is naively presented. The source of the citation is The Universe in a Single Atom:

His Holiness, The Dalai Lama said:
My confidence in venturing into science lies in my basic belief that as in science so in Buddhism, understanding the nature of reality is pursued by means of critical investigation: if scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false, then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims.

Malcolm wrote:

This citation comes on the second page of the preface, which is why it is so widely cited. But the context for HHDL's statement is found here:

His Holiness, The Dalai Lama said:
As I see it, science falls within the scope of the first truth in that it examines the material bases of suffering, for it covers the entire spectrum of the physical environment—“ the container”— as well as the sentient beings—“ the contained.” It is in the mental realm— the realm of psychology, consciousness, the afflictions, and karma— that we find the second of the truths, the origin of suffering. The third and fourth truths, cessation and the path, are effectively outside the domain of scientific analysis in that they pertain primarily to what might be called philosophy and religion.

Malcolm wrote:
Dalai Lama (2005-09-13). The Universe in a Single Atom: The Convergence of Science and Spirituality (Kindle Locations 1248-1252). Crown Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

So you see, the first quote may only be properly understood when it is given its full context, provided later on in the same book. I.e. HHDL is saying that when it comes to things like cosmology, physics and biology, the material basis of suffering, Buddhists should defer to science, as this fall under the rubric of suffering, or in other words, conventional truth of deluded persons. However, the third and fourth truths are part of ultimate truth, and are beyond science, according to HHDL. This leaves the second truth in a funny position. It might seem to some that since HHDL is saying here that the second truth concerns mental phenomena which are under the domain of scientific analysis, but since he clearly states that cessation and the path are beyond the domain of science altogether, this really leaves only psychology within the realm of scientific analysis; karma, affliction and consciousness are outside this domain because these three things are precisely what the third and fourth noble truth are concerned with.

So it is important to understand the citation properly.

Some words by Dungsey Thrinly Norbu are appropriate here:

His Holiness, The Dalai Lama said:
The reason Buddha did not predominantly teach science is that beings are already attached to materialism and reality, so they can become distracted by material ideas. Instead of only increasing materialism, Buddha taught how to believe in karma, how to develop good karma, and how to purify karma to go beyond karma on the path of enlightenment. Buddha taught beings to have faith in sublime beings because ordinary beings do not know the right direction; they can only know through faith in sublime beings who can show them the correct path. This kind of teaching is so much more powerful than ordinary materialism because it shows how not to create negative karma and how to create positive energy until attaining enlightenment. Spiritual ideas cannot be compared to the material ideas of science, and Buddhist spiritual ideas cannot be changed to accommodate scientific ideas. In Buddhism, the sciences that are taught are never totally material, because they are connected with spirituality, since they are understood to be reflections of the mind and do not deal solely with material existence.

Since modern science generally deals with material existence, people often mistakenly think that it is important for them to know more about it. By miscalculating that a material rather than a spiritual orientation will help them sustain themselves and prosper within their immediate lives, they become more concerned with materialism than with spirituality. This is the antithesis of a spiritual point of view. Since the mind does not end, it is the mind’s development of spiritual qualities that is important, and these qualities endure from one life to the next throughout the succession of one’s lives.

To me as a Seon practitioner this preoccupation with perfect doctrine is putting the cart before the horse. AFAIAC, our view should be right as much as is necessary for practice, everything else can actually be counterproductive, clogging up the mind with more proliferations, expectations, creating more divisions, aversions, cravings, etc. KISS and learn things as you go, on a need to know basis. But I know that this view is not necessarily shared by other schools. Maybe I should push to close all those 'unnecessary' threads that detract people from practice and mold the forum to be sparse and minimalist like a Zen monastery? I don't think so. Different strokes for different folks and I am glad it's like this.

As far as my decision to abandon the western text critical approach to the history of Mahāyāna sūtras, that has been a long time coming.

There is no monolithic "fundamentalist/traditionalist" viewpoint.  What is being suggested is that in a board dedicated to Mahayana and Vajrayana, each of the traditions comprised under this rubric should be evaluated and respected on its own terms.  Pure Land schools should be respected according their own scriptures and modes of interpretation. Zen, Chan, Nichiren, etc. should similarly be respected as those who uphold each of these traditions represents.

Nyingmas should not come here to try to undercut Gelukpa points of view and vice versa. How can one construe this as a monolithic position and equate it with a Buddhist Taliban as has been done on other threads? What the traditionalists have been suggesting is that the only way to respect the plethora of Buddhist traditions is respect the viewpoints *grounded in the traditions* of each in the respective forums. This so-called Buddhist modernism is really a way of dismissing all of the Buddhist traditions and replacing them with a Rorschach blot of quasi-scientific speculation. There is no lineage for this, there are no scriptures and there is no dharma of realization. It's simply discursiveness and idle chatter.

One can't go onto a medical forum and just make stuff up according to one's own viewpoint.  One would quite rightly be called a quack and a nuisance and be banned in short order. I have no problem with a separate Skeptical Buddhism forum dedicated to these issues.  I have a huge problem with having to read topic after topic where conversation degenerates to this lowest common denominator of belief argued by those interlocutors with the least grounding in scripture and meditative training and the least openness to what the traditional perspectives have to offer.

The threads you're describing, including this one, are in the Open Dharma sub-forum. I'll copy-paste the description of it below, with my own emphasis added:
No holds barred discussion on the Buddhadharma. Argue about rebirth, karma, commentarial interpretations etc. Be nice to each other.
If you don't want to read this kind of stuff, don't read this sub-forum! It's that simple.

Now, I could understand a gripe about threads being in the wrong sub-forum. But looking through them briefly, I don't see any polemical threads that stand out. The mods do a good job of sequestering that kind of stuff here. And if you have a problem with where a thread is, maybe you can contact a mod about it.

Zoom, you have some very valid points. I don't know why no one is explaining here that the attainment of the rainbow body is generally a product of the very special practice ot Togyal - a practice which requires much effort and which, in order to be brought to this particular conclusion needs to be done in strict retreat. Very few practitioners are actively and seriously engaged in Thogyal at this point in time. The rainbow body does not result from regular contemplation/resting in Rikpa, even if this is authentic. Other attainments result from that and they are described very extensively in the Dzogchen literature.

And, strictly speaking, the Guru does not do it for you, in the bardo or anywhere else, because the Guru is just our own twisted samsaric perception of the buddha nature. He/she is as external, or internal, as you want him/her to be, but never absolutely so.

Malcolm wrote:
It is easier to bring it conclusion in the bardo.

Of course, having met a path, it is up to you follow, as the  Buddha said "i cannot wash away your misdeeds with water, nor remove your suffering with my hand, but i can show you the  path to liberation."

Nevertheless, without a realized teacher of Dzogchen, it is difficult to make any progress on the path Of Dzogchen. If one does not have confidence that one's teacher is really a buddha, well, one will not make much progress on the path no matter how much one practices this or that technique.

Again, those of us who are in the Dharma must emphasize to interested newcomers the essential import of engaging in the three prajñās of hearing, reflection and cultivation. There is no prajñā identified as "reading".

In order to hear the Dharma one must go to a qualified kalayānamitra [lit. good friend], a virtuous mentor, and begin the process of hearing the Dharma.

As I stated above, Dharma is a Aural Lineage. The Aural, or Hearing lineage, is much more important, relatively speaking, than the texts. The texts must be understood on the basis of the hearing the Dharma taught by a qualified teacher. Without that essential act of hearing the Dharma taught by a living, qualified teacher, one's understanding of the Dharma is sure to be bent askew right from the start.

Once we decide to rely on a qualified mentor, then we will be able to know when our own or other's understanding of the Dharma is correct or incorrect.

Of course not, Dan.

What I am also suggesting the reason for this is that science is not derived from wisdom.

But this is not even the main point — the main point is that science is taken as more authoritative than Dharma. For example, Wayfarer constantly refers to a scientist to defend rebirth (without notable success), not masters like Nāgārjuna and so on. Perhaps he feels that people are more likely to listen to a scientist than an ancient masters?

With regard to the problems and conflicts between science and Dharma, science is not a wisdom tradition, its practitioners not necessarily wise. We can understand that this because it is technology, which we all understand to be a product of science [after all, how often have I been chided in the past two days for using technology while criticizing science as the be all and end all?] that has plunged this world into a human-made crisis of epic proportions, a fact which no one seems willing to acknowledge. Somehow, we are supposed to imagine that science in its own little unassailable domain, exempt from criticism because of its touted "benefits". Dharma on the other hand, is also assigned its domain, restricted to moral issues, but when it comes down to things like the four or five elements, etc., we are supposed to dismiss these as archaic, obsolete, "unscientific" doctrines.

Dan for example, says "...are we to blame Tibetan herbs because they can be harmful if used incorrectly?" Gee Dan, you are making a perfect argument for the NRA, since after all, it is people that kill people and not guns. As I pointed out already, most of the ills of the world today, the pollution, the over-population, the manufactured toxins in our environment, GMO crops, the extinction crisis, etc., are all a result of science that is not guided by wisdom. These days, most people understand that the proliferation of guns is not a good thing. Why is it so hard for these same people to understand that at present, in the hand of confused people science is more dangerous than any gun.

Science and Dharma should not be kept in their own domains, on the contrary, science should be subordinate to Dharma, that is to say, a follower of Dharma needs to evaluate science and technology according to its impact on the world. This is rarely done in any systematic way, and this is largely because the moral fiber and wisdom of the world-wide Post-Industrial Civilization is very weak.

Beyond this are the obvious tensions between science and Dharma that have already been pointed out.

Should people have railed against it as doing "nothing to remove the total amount of suffering in the world"? I think not.

Then, if anyone should even venture to suggest that science, as it is being used today, is actually pernicious and harmful, they immediately bring up the "well this computer and internet was brought to you by science, so shut up." These people have apparently never read In the Absence of the Sacred: The Failure of Technology and the Survival of the Indian Nations by Jerry Mander.

As for science being "reductive and destructive", it can be, usually in its infancy it is because when starting from nothing, a simple reductive model is the best you can do. In its maturity it progresses to more complex models.

I can do better, get my hands dirtier more often and contribute more positively to our local environment. But again, this is at best tangental to the topic at hand.

Malcolm wrote:
It is not tangential at all. We live in a society of heads without bodies, we are more alienated and disconnected with our world (as it rapidly disappears before our eyes, being transformed into wasteland) than at any time in history. Our civilization has produced the greatest harm to the planet we have ever seen. All of this is result of our brimming confidence in science and the technological solutions it proposes, each one of which has brought more sorrow to us than the last. All of this is a result of our collective abandonment of the wisdom traditions of our elders, our sacred traditions, our sense of sacred place, etc.

Dan74 said:
But I think you are not serious with your dismissal. Abjure all technology, give up all new materials, build your own house from basic materials and no help from powertools, sell your car, grow your own food, live like a true Luddite and you will have some credibility as far as a philosophical position on technology is concerned. But that still doesn't touch science. Science, first and foremost, is about understanding. Do you really want to close the door on scientific understanding of the material world?

Malcolm wrote:
First of all, the Luddites were not opposed to technology per se, they were trying to prevent the destruction of artisanal cottage industry weaving.

Second of all, my specific criticism is focused on the idea that scientific knowledge can supersede Dharma or that Dharma is can be understood in the manner which those who do "science" are accustomed to looking at things. Why, because as a said science is not based on wisdom, it does not even discover wisdom, it just discovers material intricacies, it is very detailed and so on, but its meaning is very, very coarse and not at all profound. There is nothing profound in science at all.

It is not possible now to live the way you suggest.

Anyway, it is you who are conflating issues, not me. I presented this premise:

Science operates from a lowest common denominator approach to evaluating knowledge. It is predicated on the perceptions of confused sentient beings, not the perceptions of awakened people.

On the one hand, the authorities’ policy of guilt by association is very harsh, and also the current tactic of control is one of micromanagement. The entire Tibetan area is under a management grid. On the surface, it appears that the situation had been easing up from such strict control, but it hasn’t. The Lhasa that I know is still under tight control.”

I know I take a risk at presenting this, but I thought this quote COULD foster a measured, kind discussion on the issue of lack of multi-ethnic participation in Western Buddhism. Hopefully any discussion will be free from false accusations (without apologies), one line missives,tit for tat claims etc.

The below I think is a response to some people objecting to specific Buddhist practice spaces for People of Colour or specific ethnic groups. Larry Yang argues that Western Buddhism is identity-based Buddhism, as Western teachers trained in Asia did not feel culturally comfortable in that paradigm and wanted to establish a space where people like them could practice:
Larry Yang: Ironically, identity-based retreats were long in the making because when the teachers of the European-American mainstream sangha came back from Asia to teach, they didn’t go to the existing Asian temples or venues that were already in North America. They started the mainstream centers we know today because they didn’t see themselves reflected in these Asian temples. They didn’t hear their life stories, they didn’t hear the relevance to how these teachings actually dissolved their particular suffering in their particular life. This is the exact same reason that the identity retreats have been formed. Even in our expression of difference, we’re the same. There is something that still completely connects us. The point of these retreats is to garner a strength of practice to enable us to see beyond the differences.

Thanks for clarifying that.

There is no need for there to be a conflct between science and Buddhism. I can't see any reason why the Buddha, and Buddhists, would oppose the means of enhancing life expectancy, providing communications technology, optimising food crops, and developing many new means of livelihood, to mention but a few aspects.  Scientific medicine alone has done immense amounts to reduce human suffering.

Malcolm wrote:
As HHDL puts it in the book from which you draw your quote:

Wayfarer said:
Buddhism draws the critical division differently— i.e., between sentience and non-sentience— because it is primarily interested in the alleviation of suffering and the quest for happiness. In Buddhism, the evolution of the cosmos and the emergence of the sentient beings within it— indeed, effectively everything within the purview of the physical and life sciences— belong within the domain of the first of the Four Noble Truths, which the Buddha taught in his initial sermon. The Four Noble Truths state that within the realm of impermanent phenomena there is suffering, suffering has an origin, the cessation of suffering is possible, and there is a path to the cessation of suffering. As I see it, science falls within the scope of the first truth in that it examines the material bases of suffering, for it covers the entire spectrum of the physical environment—“ the container”— as well as the sentient beings—“ the contained.” It is in the mental realm— the realm of psychology, consciousness, the afflictions, and karma— that we find the second of the truths, the origin of suffering. The third and fourth truths, cessation and the path, are effectively outside the domain of scientific analysis in that they pertain primarily to what might be called philosophy and religion.

Malcolm wrote:
Dalai Lama (2005-09-13). The Universe in a Single Atom: The Convergence of Science and Spirituality (Kindle Locations 1243-1252). Crown Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

You see here, rather than saying this or that topic falls within science's domain, he claims that science falls within a specified subset of the Buddhist analysis of the existential problem facing all sentient beings, suffering.

It is true that modern medicine has had some impact on the area of the first kind of suffering, the suffering of suffering, it has had no impact on the second kind of suffering, the suffering of change, and in fact it can be argued that suffering of change is more endemic than ever before in what we know of human history. No only that, modern science has vastly increased the means of inflicting the suffering of suffering, as we see in the wars we have been having in the Middle East and during the 20th century. So, advances in technology are not really so rosy in fact, and do not actually add up to more happiness for human beings and other kinds of creatures.

A great deal of what we call "science" is merely technology, and great deal of science that is done has no practical use at all. For example, most of the scientific knowledge we have about the cellular processes of the human body are not at all valuable in medical cures, and the vast majority of synthesized drugs are derived from plants whose properties have been known for centuries by indigenous healers. Moreover, many of the diseases we now can cure are diseases that are a product of our technological and very toxic industrial civilization, diseases which were rare or non-existent even in the not so distant past. One thing I will grant is that in the area of surgery, surgical technology has been able to advance a great deal in the past 170 years, but primarily due to two factors, antibiotics and anesthesia.

In other words, the scientific revolution has created ten problems for every one that it has solved, from global warming to increased pollution of the biosphere, to an unprecedented extinction event that is ongoing and so on.

So forgive me for not placing any confidence at all in the confused perception of ordinary beings, whose thrashing efforts to free themselves from suffering merely bring more problems and pain.

That said, would the Buddha, if he were to appear today, be counseling someone in breathing meditation using the example of a blacksmith's bellow? No, more likely he'd be referring to spin class.

In other words, it is ok, in your view, to make defamatory remarks about Buddhadharma since it is not "scientific", but it is not ok to call people on it when they make such remarks from a scientific materialist perspective. In other words, we, who follow Buddhadharma, are barred from defending our tradition, according to you, if its traditions contravene "science".

I suppose what I'm saying is that mythology is different from science, and I wish the advertisement for this event would have made it clear that this event was within the realm of "Buddhist mythology." But I think I have to accept that maybe it wasn't advertised that way because some people believe it is scientifically, literally true that the relics are from the historical Buddha.

The term is "sharira". The Buddha's remains from his cremation were divided into eight parts and placed in Stupas.

Buddhist masters have been producing shariraṃ in all traditions for centuries. The understanding of shariraṃ is highly developed in Tibetan Buddhism, especially in the Dzogchen teachings, where many different kinds of shariraṃ from different parts of the body, indicating different levels of practice are detailed by the Buddha in texts such as the Brilliant Relics Tantra and so on. For example,  in the Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra, Buddha states:
After my nirvana
in order to generate the devotion of migrating beings 
place the relics in a statue. 
Place these major classes of relics
in statues of my form.
The Buddha teaches in the Bhadrakalpika-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra
Making a small offering to the relics of the Sugata in nirvana has limitless qualities.
Kuśalamūla-paridhara-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra
The transformation of his relics, 
is just like my nirvana, 
the relics of the Sugata sNying po Tshogs,
those will transform.
The Arya-sarvadharmaguṇavyūharāja-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:
At a place of stupa containing relics or a temple, make offerings with incense, scents, various flowers and various pennants.

I hesitate to start this thread because I don't mean to seem disrespectful, much less sacrilegious. So, let me state upfront that this is an honest, sincere question….

I attended the loving kindness tour a few days ago, which is a part of the Maitreya Project through the Foundation for the Preservation of the Mahayana Tradition. I was completely caught off guard. When I saw the word "relic" in their advertisements, I thought in terms of archaeology. I didn't know about the concept of "relics" in the Tibetan tradition. I came to feel that these are relics in the same way that the bread was the body of Jesus in my Catholic childhood. Symbolically.

To be honest I'm almost at a loss here. I will refrain from posting my more blunt thoughts on the topic, for fear of offending some people. But I suppose my questions would be as follows: 1. What is the general consensus of the relics on this tour? Do people actually believe that they have relics from the historical Buddha? (It would seem to me that something that rare and valuable would be displayed at the Smithsonian behind lock and key, under video surveillance, and under the careful watch of a security guard nearby. Not casually displayed at the local Masonic Temple, where any average Joe from off the street could wander in and then place the relics of the historical Buddha on his head!) 2. Have such relics ever been verified by any scientist?

I'll be a little more blunt, though hopefully tactful and not disrespectful. Truth is that it was a very disillusioned and disappointing display for me. I guess I would like to know that there are other Buddhists out there who don't believe in this either….

Considering that the bardo is an incredibly important topic in Dzogchen, since this where most people are going to attain liberation, how can you possibly call yourself a Dzogchen practitioner, and yet spend so much time and effort rejecting the teachings in the antarābhava? As the Buddha states in The Union of the Sun and Moon Tantra (an important tantra belonging to man ngag sde):
The place entered by all sentient beings
who do not possess this instruction
is called “the bardo of existence.”
The doorway to the path of the places of samsara,
for example, is turning like a water wheel.
Having separated from the body of ordinary flesh and blood,
one has an illusory mental body,
which has two names since it incorporeal.
And the Self-Liberated Vidyā Tantra states (a tantra belonging to man ngag sde):
After people of average capacity
have died and left this world, passed through the bardo
and have been born in buddhafields of half-visible emanations,
they are free from all paths of samsara.
So you see, the teachings about the bardo are incredibly important for Vajrayāna and Dzogchen practitioners. The teachings are not something to be debated about for sport.

Stephen Batchelor says that there are four key components of Buddha's teachings that are unique and not a part of the culture of the time. These are the for unique views (here I am quoting SB):

"1. The principle of "this-conditionality, conditioned arising."
2. The principle of the Four Noble Truths.
3. The practice of mindful awareness.
4. The power of self-reliance."

Not so bad if you take these on and perfect them. I mean if you live them and they become part of a lived experience. More than enough there to keep the dharma pure.

However, the fact is that all western science, philosophy and religjon falls under the category of either non-Buddhist eternalism or annihilationism.

In Abhidhamma there are irreducible ultimate dhammas or ultimate objects of right knowledge and these are separate from conceptualised conventionalities. These ultimate dhammas are universal and unchanging. They do not depend on concepts and are uncovered by analysing the conventional. These ultimates are naturalistic. They are laws that are the same everywhere and at every time. They are independent of mind's conceptualizing. I think science and dharma uncover these paramattha. And in that sense dhamma is naturalistic.

Nibbana is also an ultimate in that it is the law of 'unconditionality'.

I also feel compelled to refer once more the well-known book by the Dalai Lama on philosophy of science, The Universe in a Single Atom. That book is not the least 'anti-science' whilst showing a clear grasp of the distinction between science as method, and scientific materialism as an attitude.

No, this is not the case. The Karmaprajñāpti is about karma. Nandagarbhāvakrāntinirdeśa is about how conception and development in the womb takes place. For example:
If the father and mother are of noble social class, or endowed with great merit, but the intermediate existence being’s merit heap is small; or if the intermediate existence beings’ social class is noble, or is endowed with great merit,  but the father and mother’s merit is small, or even though both are endowed with merit, when past actions to mutually meet together are not accumulated, there cannot be entry into the womb.
In this case, merit of the father and mother can be an external condition determining whether conception can occur or not.

@Jikan...Consciousness in the context of my last few posts is the rebirth-linking consciousness. I'm looking at the Abhidharma texts. It is stated quite clearly that this rebirth-linking consciousness requires prior cause or kamma that is the result of action. It is said that this type of Kamma (productive kamma) that is responsible for generating the rebirth-linking consciousness exists prior to that consciousness and that "during the course of existence it produces other resultant cittas and the continuities of kamma-born materiality, such as the sense faculties, sexual determination, and the heart-base." The heart-base is quite interesting in itself and could be a separate topic of discussion.

So it seems that kamma exists as an objective condition as the result of action prior to the manifestation of the consciousness. In this case it is not that consciousness contains within it all types of kamma.

I've been studying the materials. Especially the Abhidharma texts. In the text that Sherab linked to it says:

"At the moment of conception, productive kamma generates the rebirth-linking consciousness and the kamma-born types of materiality constituting the physical body of the new being."

So here there is no mechanics of descent of consciousness into a womb. Here it is kamma that that is generating consciousness. kamma here means prior cause or prior action. So consciousness here is not an isolated force or energy that somehow is disembodied and then dives into the conception. Rather it is portrayed as having a prior cause rooted in the material/conscious being of others.

You might think that I am trolling here or that this topic is boring. But for me, rebirth and how it actually happens (if it happens) is very interesting. It would be great if some clarity could be shed on the subject. What I have been given so far are links. Since those who hold to literal rebirth do so very seriously, then they must have seriously questioned the concept. And after investigating they must have come up with reasoned arguments to support their belief. So lets hear them. What we have been getting so far is that you HAVE to believe in rebirth. Belief without reason is not quite right. So please put forward the reasoning that supports your belief in literal rebirth.

Belief is a word I try to avoid because it is too loaded. I prefer the description of "safeguarding the truth" in the Canki Sutta:

MN 95 said:
"If a person likes something... holds an unbroken tradition... has something reasoned through analogy... has something he agrees to, having pondered views, his statement, 'This is what I agree to, having pondered views,' safeguards the truth. But he doesn't yet come to the definite conclusion that 'Only this is true; anything else is worthless.' To this extent, Bharadvaja, there is the safeguarding of the truth. To this extent one safeguards the truth. I describe this as the safeguarding of the truth. But it is not yet an awakening to the truth.

Mkoll said:
Rebirth is an integral of the Buddha's teachings and I've chosen to be a disciple of the Buddha. That's reason enough for me to listen to what he says about it and think about it. And I've come to the point where I agree with it, "having pondered views". As for how rebirth happens and the mechanics of it, I think that subject is not conjecturable.

There's a 252 page thread on Dhamma Wheel with more than 5000 posts and a 38 page thread here on Dharma Wheel about rebirth. I'm sure you'll find alternative perspectives there.

Norpa Yonten who was killed as Chinese forces opened fire
Chinese security forces opened fire on Tibetan protesters, killing at least one man, earlier today.

Free Tibet is aware of more than 30 others who have been injured, many of them shot, after a large gathering in Draggo (also known as Drango) was fired upon. It is not known why the Chinese opened fire.

The situation is still ongoing.

Tibetans shot

The dead man has been named as Norpa Yonten (right), a 49-year-old lay person from Norpa village, Norchung township in Draggo County. His body has been taken to the nearby Draggo monastery.

At least one other person has been taken to the monastery with gunshot wounds. Locals are fearful to take the injured to hospital in case they are arrested.

Tibetans are reportedly travelling to Draggo and large crowds are gathering in the grounds of the monastery.

Arrest of Tibetans

It is still unclear what sparked the protest. There are reports that Tibetans around Draggo were arrested this morning on suspicion of distributing leaflets and posters calling for freedom and the protest was a response to these arbitrary detentions.

There are also claims that it was in response to celebrations marking the Chinese New Year which many local Tibetans had decided to boycott due to the growing unrest.

The protesters were heard to call out for freedom for Tibet and the return of the Dalai Lama.

Internet access is now banned in Draggo.

That very much depends on where you are in Tibet. In central Tibet, it is not possible. There, religious activities are very strictly controlled. Any monastery that gets too popular, or too big, gets throttled very quickly anywhere one is in Tibet. There are spies everywhere. During the 2008 riots, Chinese used provocateurs to incite looting using this as an excuse for cracking down. Lhasa is heavily patrolled and non-Chinese tourists are not allowed to travel there freely, and never without a "guide".

And incidentally, I was not in China Tibet as a "tourist". I was there studying Tibetan Medicine.

The Gaṇḍāvyuha sūtra states: Young Manibhadra, bodhisattvas who correctly adhere to the virtuous mentor  do not fall into lower realms; they realize the uniformity of all phenomena; they are shown the paths of bliss and misery; they are instructed in the conduct of Samantabhadra; they are shown the path to the city of omniscience; they are carried to the place of omniscience…
And:
The virtuous mentor  comprehends incorrect actions, correctly turns one away from shameless places, extracts one from the city of samsara…Child of a good family, since one always thinks in that way, serve virtuous mentors.
The Ratnamegha-sūtra states: Now then, since the qualities of virtue will increase and nonvirtue will decline if one relies on the guru, the preceptor [mkhan po, upādhyāyaḥ] will generate the thought of teaching those with greater or lesser hearing, or those with discipline or corrupted discipline.

I think the real concern is less about Tibet and more about Xinjiang. The latter has the potential to become another Afghanistan or Chechnya if certain elements acquired firearms. Just look at the spat of killings and bombings around China within the last year.

Tibet is linked to Xijiang geographically and politically. Any move towards independence on the part of Tibetans is likely to be regarded as an encouraging example which Xinjiang dissidents could emulate and capitalize on. The same level of policing, if not more, is likely active in Xinjiang, too, though Tibetan activists either overlook this or are unaware of it.

Malcolm wrote:
Everyone is aware.

Indrajala said:
Human Rights activists do have a point that heavy policing causes a great amount of suffering amongst the common people, but it is a lot more complex than that. There's also the point that "Human Rights" are way with which western countries bully their opponents, like China and Russia. To be a Human Rights violator is tantamount to being a monster, even though the purported monster is acting logically albeit in a morally questionable fashion.

Yeti hair identified as ancestral polar bear

From Forbes: Samples of hair believed to be from the abominable snowman are actually from an ancestor of the polar bear.

The discovery raises the possibility that stories of an undiscovered giant primate living in the Himalayas may be based on large and aggressive, but reclusive, bears.

Bryan Sykes, a human genetics professor at Oxford University, and Michel Sartori, director of the Lausanne Museum of Zoology, formed the Oxford-Lausanne Collateral Hominid Project to test the stories of ‘anomalous primates’ from around the world.

They and their colleagues analysed 57 samples of hair allegedly from creatures including the Himalayan yeti, sasquatch (Bigfoot) from North America, almasty from Russia, orang pendek from Sumatra, and migyhur from Bhutan, submitting 36 of them to DNA testing.

But, as they report in Proceedings of the Royal Society B, most were from horses, dogs and in one case a human, or were not hair at all.

Two of them, however, closely matched the DNA from a polar bear fossil found on Svalbard, an island in the Russian Arctic, dating back 40,000 years to the Pleistocene period, when much of continental Asia was covered with glaciers.

One of the samples, a golden-brown tuft, came from an animal shot in Ladakh, India, in the 1970s, the other, reddish-brown hair was found in a bamboo forest high in Bhutan described as a migyhur nest.
....

The hairs are either from a new bear species, a colour variant of polar bears or a hybrid of polar bears and brown bears, the researchers concluded.
....
OTOH, their Bigfoot sample was ruled out completely.  These results are being hailed as a win for cryptozoology.

I know a European couple that ran a hotel in Lhasa for many years, not sure if they still do, but they had lots of first hand experience with this sort of thing.  For one, every hotel and guest house has at least two watchers posted their to keep an eye on, i.e. follow guests.  And I'm just talking about foreign tourists here, not Tibetan.  They had cops coming in regularly to install "bugs" in the rooms of people they deemed suspicious.  And the owners themselves had heavily armed security forces bust through their door on more than one occassion for little more than things they were talking about on the phone.  So not only were they constantly listening in on their phones calls, they even had somebody who understood their particular language.  So, there's no reason to doubt the above guidelines.  I have spent a fair amount of time in Tibet and I have had run ins with the police everywhere I have gone.  Nothing serious, but they make sure you know that they are watching you and take down you're info.  More specifically, I have spent time in Ngaba, which is ground zero for the immolations.  And the military presence and harrassment there made it look like the West Bank, and that was before they started.  So again, Jeff, I don't where you come up with this nonsense you spew about how good Tibetans have it and how lax the Chinese gov't is, but it just shows your complete ignorance on this subject.

Tsering Woeser (1966, Lhasa) is a courageous Tibetan writer, who offers unique perspectives on the complexities of Tibet today. The daughter of Communist Party members, her father an officer in the People’s Liberation Army, Woeser was educated, and writes, in Mandarin Chinese.

Following literary studies, she was posted to Lhasa as editor of the journal Tibetan Literature and began to uncover her true heritage. In Tibet Above (1999), Woeser published poems exploring her Tibetan identity. Her next book, Notes on Tibet (2003), addressing cultural and political issues more directly and critically through portraits of Tibetan lives, was banned; she lost her job and all social benefits but resolved to use words as her weapon and to record Tibet’s past and present.

Moving to the greater anonymity of Beijing, she used the internet to publish increasingly explicit commentaries on the arrest and torture of Tibetans – the appealing literary qualities of her writing conveying her message all the more effectively. Woeser’s concern with Tibetan culture continued in articles on contemporary painting, film and literature, and in groundbreaking books including Forbidden Memory: Tibet During the Cultural Revolution (2006), which combines her father’s photographs of the period with eyewitness accounts she gathered through interviews.

During the mass demonstrations against Chinese rule and violent crackdown in 2008, Woeser’s blogs became the main source of information for the world. Relaying details from her contacts in Tibet, she posted daily reports on the protests, human rights abuses and extrajudicial killings.

Woeser has undergone house arrest and harassment, her websites have been closed down, her movements are restricted and her life under constant surveillance, but she continues to write about Tibet from inside China. Woeser is honoured for her courage in speaking for those who are silenced and oppressed, for her compelling combination of literary quality and political reportage, for recording, articulating and supporting Tibetan culture, and for her active commitment to self-determination, freedom and development in Tibet.”

2. I often post a reply too quickly, without sufficiently reading and reflecting on what the other person has written.

3. I sometimes come to the forum looking for mental stimulation (hence 1 & 2) - an internet fix of half entertainment/half learning.

5. I try to write simply, clearly and honestly, but it often comes across as verbose.

6. I like to bring heavy duty philosophy to bear on topics that may not warrant it.

In one such scheme proto-conscious experience is a basic property of physical reality accessible to a quantum process associated with brain activity.

Certainly within Shaiva and Shakta sources it is not true that alcohol and meat were included to attract people habituated to their use. In fact, it was specifically prohibited for them as their character would fall into pashubhava. The pancamakara are only to be used by those with virabhava disposition.

Boudica (/ˈbuːdɨkə/; alternative spelling: Boudicca), also known as Boadicea /boʊdɨˈsiːə/, and known in Welsh as Buddug [ˈbɨ̞ðɨ̞ɡ][1] (d. AD 60 or 61) was queen of the British Iceni tribe, a Celtic tribe who led an uprising against the occupying forces of the Roman Empire.

Boudica's husband Prasutagus was ruler of the Iceni tribe. He ruled as a nominally independent ally of Rome and left his kingdom jointly to his daughters and the Roman emperor in his will. However, when he died, his will was ignored and the kingdom was annexed as if conquered. Boudica was flogged, her daughters were raped, and Roman financiers called in their loans.

In AD 60 or 61, while the Roman governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus was leading a campaign on the island of Anglesey off the northwest coast of Wales, Boudica led the Iceni as well as the Trinovantes and others in revolt.[2] They destroyed Camulodunum, which is modern Colchester. Camulodunum was earlier the capital of the Trinovantes, but at that time was a colonia—a settlement for discharged Roman soldiers, as well as the site of a temple to the former Emperor Claudius. Upon hearing the news of the revolt, Suetonius hurried to Londinium (modern London), the twenty-year-old commercial settlement that was the rebels' next target.

The Romans, having concluded that they did not have the numbers to defend the settlement, evacuated and abandoned Londinium. Boudica led 100,000 Iceni, Trinovantes and others to fight the Legio IX Hispana and burned and destroyed Londinium, and Verulamium (modern-day St Albans).[3][4] An estimated 70,000–80,000 Romans and British were killed in the three cities by those led by Boudica.[5] Suetonius, meanwhile, regrouped his forces in the West Midlands, and despite being heavily outnumbered, defeated the Britons in the Battle of Watling Street.

The crisis caused the Emperor Nero to consider withdrawing all Roman forces from Britain, but Suetonius's eventual victory over Boudica confirmed Roman control of the province. Boudica then either killed herself so she would not be captured, or fell ill and died. The extant sources, Tacitus[6] and Cassius Dio, differ.[7]

For example if you already do intensive yidam practice - you'd practice pure vision, in which all beings are Buddhas (Yidam) already, there is no impure or unworthy object of Refuge, everybody is perfect Buddha.

Malcolm wrote:
Not when you are taking refuge...during refuge everyone becomes Buddha in the form of whatever deity you are practicing, but in the beginning oneself and all sentient beings are in their ordinary form.

Of course, there are some refuge supplications where one begins through recognizing one's vidyā as the object of refuge, but that is only in Atiyoga.

Karinos said:
so, are you saying that for the purpose of taking Refuge while doing any sadhana I should abandon purevision and for few minutes pretend to see my vajra brothers and sisters as well as other sentient beings as ordinary ?

Malcolm wrote:
Yes.

As far as pretend, it is your pure vision that is pretend, and not the other way around. Remember a sadhana is a way of practicing the whole path of Buddhahood in a single session. So normally we start as ordinary being, raise bodhicitta, gather merit and wisdom and so on.

If the Tibetans don't learn to read, write and speak fluent Mandarin, they'll be basically unable to secure professional employment in the nation they belong to.

This is not how you encourage economic opportunities for an ethnic minority. How are you going to train Tibetan engineers and chemists? In Tibetan? No, they need to learn Mandarin and learn it well.

If Tibetans don't learn Chinese, they'll lack skills necessary for success in secular society (unless you propose they learn English), and then they'll complain they're being economically disenfranchised.

In terms of Chinese people themselves in China, I have always found them friendly, but fearful. Given that my interests are pretty much confined to Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, I don't have much more than a tangential interest in China. I was more interested in Sino-Japanese Buddhism when Shingon perked my interest back in the day. But that was a long time ago. I have read many of the classics in translation with more than passing interest, and have found authors like the neo-confucians Chu Hsi and Wang Yang Ming engaging. But I was never so interested in China as to learn Chinese, etc. I appreciate classical Chinese culture, literature, and art, what I know and understand of it, and recognize that Chinese cultural influences made an indelible stamp on Tibetan culture, in much the same way it did on Japanese culture, or British culture on American and Canadian culture, etc.

If you say so. I'm not willing to contradict my teacher in whose realization I trust, and upon whom my realization depends.

Whatever fine matter is in the bardo being it lost its connection to the corpse.

Malcolm wrote:
I do say so. Refined means processed through digestion, in this case, the lungs.

Yes, these things are just a visualization WHEN WE ARE visualizing them for the purpose of gtummo and so on. But there is no point to HOLDING THE BREATH if the vāyu is not just the element of air in the body.

Sam, you have clearly not understood the distinction between how we visualize things when we practice and how they naturally exist in our karmically developed body.

In Dzogchen the distinction between matter and consciousness is abandoned as an error. This is very clearly explained by Padmasambhava in the Khandro Nyinthig:
After first being created by the energy [rtsal] of wisdom, in the middle, as it was not recognized that the body of the refined part of the assembled elements actually is the five wisdoms, since this was not realized through intellectual views, the non-sentient and sentient both appear, but don’t believe it. Here, it is actually five wisdoms to begin with; in the middle, when the body is formed from assembly of the elements through ignorance grasping onto those [five wisdoms] also, it is actually the five wisdoms. The five aggregates, sense organs, and afflictions also are actually the five wisdoms. In the end, one transcends accepting, rejecting, proofs, and negations since those are realized to be real. As such, the sign of non-duality is [the body] disappearing into wisdom without any effluents  because the critical point of the non-duality or sameness of the non-sentient and the sentient was understood according to the Guru’s intimate instruction.
This is why it is crazy to deny that the nāḍīs, vāyus and bindus are not physical. When you claim they are non-physical you are just falling into a totally dualistic error.

Because the teaching of existence, nonexistence and so on are for engaging the mind on the inner nature, whatever is shown to be without either, that demonstrates the ultimate.

Form derived from the four great elements can be nonphysical, as I edited, so translating 'rupa' as 'matter' begs the question.

Malcolm wrote:
No, there is nothing non-physical that is derived from the four great elements, hence in this context, "matter" is the correct rendering. Where rūpa means the object of the eye, there "form" is just fine.

Further, the Abhidharmakośaṭīkālakṣaṇānusāriṇī clarifies:
If it is asked what nāma is in the sutras that analyze nāmarūpa, [nāma] is the four aggregates that are non-material, i.e., vedanaskandha up to vijñānaskandha. If it is asked what rūpa is, anything which is rūpa is all of that which is the four great elements or uses the four elements as a cause.
Further, when we come to Mahāyāna sources, the Āryānandagarbhāvakrāntinirdeśa states:
Whatever is consciousness, that is called "nāma".
Or the Āryānantamukhapariśodhananirdeśaparivarta-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:
All phenomena are described by the conventions name [nāma] and sign [nimitta]. Therein, whatever is a sign, this is the four great elements termed as rūpa. Whatever is nāma, that is the four aggregates designated as ārupa..."
In general, we can understand that nāmarūpa also refers to the moment after conception during gestation, prior to the development of the six sense organs — the period roughly up to the 19th week of gestation. For example, the Vyaktapadāsuhṛllekhaṭīkā states:
If it asked what is name and form, after the time of conception in the mother's womb, it the non-material aggregates such as sensation and so on, and the  material aggregate of the elements and their products.

For example, in the Vibhanga, it is clearly stated that the four mental skandhas are considered nāma, and the material aggregate, rūpa, is considered made up of the substances of the four great elements.

daverupa said:
Something along different lines can be found:

SN 12.2 said:
And what, bhikkhus, is name-and-form? Feeling, perception, volition, contact, attention: this is called name. The four great elements and the form derived from the four great elements: this is called form. Thus this name and this form are together called name-and-form.

daverupa said:
There's no reason to consider that namarupa needs to encompass the aggregates, especially since sankhara already happened in the dependent origination chain & vinnana isn't part of namarupa, while in addition 'contact' is based on the sense spheres which follow namarupa in the chain.

Namarupa is not mental(ity)-material(ity), and there is no implicit substance dualism in the term.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, there is an implicit substance dualism in the term.

"Feeling, perception, volition, contact, attention: this is called name. The four great elements and the matter derived from the four great elements: this is called matter. "

I think that the Buddhist conception of 'substance' is different to the modern one, on the grounds that their idea of momentary dharmas, is that they are moments of experience. They are neither, therefore, 'self-existent', nor really objective, in the way that materialist atomism conceives of them.

Malcolm wrote:
Which Buddhist conception of substance are you talking about? I was referring the Vaibhaṣika concept of dravya.

In any event, Jayarava is clearly wrong when he claims that Buddhism in general does not propose a kind substance dualism. It is implicit in the term nāmarūpa. For example, in the Vibhanga, it is clearly stated that the four mental skandhas are considered nāma, and the material aggregate, rūpa, is considered made up of the substances of the four great elements.

Everything is empty of inherent existence: impermanent, dependent on causes and conditions.

This is something that can be expressed quite clearly.

Ultimate truth is inexpressible, as the Ārya-pitāputrasamāgamana-sūtra states:
Whatever is ultimate, that is inexpressible.
Ārya-sarvabuddhaviṣayāvatārajñānālokālaṃkāra-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
Mañjuśrī, so-called "emptiness" is an expression for stopping clinging to the non-empty, but, Mañjuśrī, it is said a dharma called "empty" is never perceived in the ultimate, it is a proliferation.
As Śantideva clearly points out:
The ultimate is not within the experiential sphere of the mind, 
the mind is described as relative.

Everything changes. Isn't that a primary Buddhist tenet? Belief systems, of all kinds, adapt in order to remain relevant or they fade away into the abyss of meaninglessness. Is Buddhism becoming less patriarchal as time goes on, for example? That seems to be a shift that follows cultural trends, and it's a good trend, or at least I think it is. It's probably just the nihilist in me that makes me value equal rights.

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddha expressed his realization in the following manner as recounted in the Lalitavistara-sūtra:
Profound, free from dust, luminous, unconditioned,
I have attained the deathless Dharma.
The means to realize that have been revealed for different people in different ways depending on their inclinations and capacities (which is why we have three yānas), but the essential meaning the Buddha realized is not subject to change, is eternal and constant. It is hard to explain, which is why the Buddha then added:
Even were I to teach, others will not understand.
I think I will remain silent in the forest
But then, as we know, Great Brahma asked the Buddha to teach because there were some who would understand.

My point is that there is nothing we need to adapt. Buddha realized an eternal truth, not subject to change. As I said, while different epochs and persons may require different means to realize that truth, the fundamental realization of the Buddha is immutable.

Be careful for you are on a slippy slope there my friend. For that still only refers to those sutras describing situations in which Sakyamuni was present or gave explicit permission or blessings. So one still must be precise as to which sutras are being referred to. But more importantly if you get too loose in regards to interpreting "Śakyamuni Buddha's permission and blessings" then your entire argument on that other 80+ page thread is nullified, as any lineage holder could be said to have such permission and blessings; in which case it would make no difference whether they were accurate transcripts of teachings actually spoken or attended by Shakyamuni or simply composed by another person long after the fact.

No, it's not a slippery slope at all.

A lineage holder does not have the same authority, for example, as a Vimalakirti, and so on.

These different types of teachings as Buddhavacana are well established. For example, we have suttas in the Pali canon taught by Śariputra or Dhammadinna, wholly on Buddha's permission.

If Buddhadharma is the ultimate dharma, and if a person is ultimately a Buddha at their essence beneath all the layers of obscurations, then it's quite easy to see how any one person can cling, even at a subconscious level, to Buddhism. It's not too difficult to find similar examples in other areas of people having major inconsistencies in their lives. As Emerson said "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines."

Yes, I am willing to allow that of course the "instinct" to awaken comes from our inherent buddhadhātu -- that is a sensible explanation.

I was not talking about someone new, but rather, someone who decides in the end that they do not accept the Buddha's teachings on karma and rebirth for whatever reason, and yet persist in identifying themselves as Buddhists and so on.

Aren't they new to Buddhism though? We talk about incalculable eons, impermanence, rebirth, etc, and yet 20, 30, 50 years makes something not new? Isn't that a "materialist" view?
Well, it really depends on which relative scale you would like to apply. From that point of view, such people's rejection of the core truths of Dharma arise from traces that are countless eons in the making. Such a sad waste of precious human birth.

Unknown said:
Isn't it possible, within the Buddhist schema, to live 100s of lifetimes and still be "new" to Buddhism, even if you were a Buddhist in all those lifetimes, or at least had heard of Buddhism? I don't ask this as a rhetorical question, I'm genuinely curious.

It's really no big deal that they do this. I mean, which is the bigger deal, that they do this, or that others need to go on about how wrong they are to continue self-identifying as Christians?

I didn't say it was "wrong", I said I didn't really understand why someone (in this case a convert to Dharma) would bother maintaing an identity as  Buddhist, having rejected Buddha's core teachings.

It's an important point. Although may be you don't see it. If Buddhism sets itself up in opposition to Science then it will die. Science is not completely formulated - it's an ongoing field of knowledge. This is how Buddhism needs to be. It needs to work itself out in people's experience. It needs to continue to offer relevant ways to view and overcome suffering.

Buddhadharma is complete.  As a product of the Buddha's wisdom, it offers a complete path of freedom and omniscience. Buddhadharma is not a result of experimentation and revision with new data.

That requires the realization of the first bhumi — and then only when one is established in āryan equipoise. Otherwise, one suffers just like everyone else, the difference being that one knows that it is fundamentally like a dream.

We on the other hand react to suffering as if it is quite real, since we are under the grip of the deep-seated delusion of self-grasping — at least I am, I do not know about the rest of you.

Thank you for doing the work, xabir. And better than I would have, I might add.

As you can see, Malcolm, loving-kindness can be used as a basis (along with the rest of the Path <--- this should go without saying) for not only non-returning, but arahantship as well.

Malcolm wrote:
You are not really understanding what the Buddha is saying here.

Dhyāna is not a path out of samsara by itself (this is one of the Agamic Buddha's discoveries), but it can be used as a support for the path.

Loving kindness is not a path, but can be used as a support for the path.

Śīla is not a path, but can be used as a support.

Where did I ever suggest otherwise?

What I said was that the four brahma-viharas are not paths, and the Kalamas sutta does not teach a path out of samsara.

It seems to me that if we are going to define dharma as "strictly that which the Buddha alone taught, and which is not found in any other religion," then we would have to say the only real dharmic teachings are not-self and dependent origination.

That would also mean that karma is not a Buddhist teaching, as it is found in other sramana movements that preceded the Buddha.

Malcolm wrote:
There is Dharma, then there is Buddhadharma. Buddhadharma is superior to other Dharmas (so we believe) because it liberates from samsara. But Buddhism, a Dharma religion, shares common features with other Dharma religions as well. Other Dharmas also assert that rebirth occurs because of karma and klesha and so on, and that liberation too comes about from the eradication of karma and kleshas.

It is important to understand the difference between mundane Dharma and Buddhadharma.

Therein lies the value of practicing Buddhism, even if it's incomplete. We talk like we all believe in rebirth but really? Do we really? For the vast majority of Buddhists, it will take incalculable lifetimes to reach Buddhahood. Yet we act as if people don't get it quite right in this lifetime, it's a bust, a complete waste of time.

Sorry, but the four brahmaviharas are not a liberative path — that is why the Buddha called them, as well as the practice of the ten virtues, "the vehicle of humans and devas" since they only lead to higher rebirth and not out of samsara.

Mkoll said:
By themselves, you are correct, they are not sufficient for liberation. But, along with the rest of the Eightfold Path, loving-kindness can be used as a basis, a meditation object if you will, for the attainment of non-returner in the Theravada tradition. Please see the Metta Sutta for the evidence of this.

Malcolm wrote:
I do not see this as saying that metta leads to the path of a non-returner, but rather, it is contrasting a mundane path with a transmundane path.

Yes, of course if you become a buddha or an arhat in this life, you will cease suffer. Apart from that, no, you will not cease to suffer. Instread

When I say that "Buddhism does not teach a way not to suffer in this life" what I mean is that Buddhism does not provide any means of eradicating suffering apart from full buddhahood. Certainly even bodhisattvas on the paths and stages still experience suffering since, they possess the twin obscurations on the lower bhumis. Granted, Bodhisattvas on the pure stages do not experience suffering, but then they have conquered death.

So, exactly in what way does Buddhadharma teach a way not to suffer in this life short of attaining some āryan realization?

I mean, of course, we all understand that suppression of afflictions through śīla and samadhi will prevent us from engaging in actions that will result in suffering, but what about the suffering we are presently experiencing?

I am all ears if anyone has any real suggestions.

Whatever suffering you experience is the ripening of past actions not even the buddha's can prevent. The goal of Buddhist practice is to awaken and end the cycle of birth in samsara.

My objection is that people are constantly putting this forward as evidence of tangible fruits of Buddhist practice when they are not even Buddhist practices at all per se, and do not, in any way whatsoever address the issue of suffering.

We also read that "through the blessing or empowerment of Buddha"  such & such bodhisattva spoke.  Thus "in some manner or form."

But this is why i picked that specific sutra for in it the retinue specifically requests the Buddha to call Manjushri so that they might see him. Buddha does nothing more than call Manjushri to join them, and refuses to ask or command Manjushri to teach. And then they ask to hear him not recount the teachings of Shakyamuni but rather those of Ratnaketu: Then the divine son Lord of Peace and Calm bowed to the Blessed One and said, with joined palms, “Blessed One, all of us would like to listen, so please ask Mañjuśrī Kumārabhuta to teach.”
The Blessed One replied, “Divine son, you yourself should make that request.”
So the divine son said, “Mañjuśrī, it would be wonderful if you could give us a Dharma teaching similar to what is taught in the buddha realm of the blessed one, the Thus-Gone Ratnaketu.”
And as pointed out above other sutras were composed or transcribed by others such as Huineng. So i, and it would appear others as well, find the wording of your poll question to be too vague.

The development of the platform sutra is not relevant to the discussion.

It is one thing to have Mahāyāna sutras that transcend time when taught in Akaniṣṭha by the Sambhogakāya to an emanated retinue -- quite another when they feature retinues like Śariputra (who passed a few months before the Buddha), and so on.
