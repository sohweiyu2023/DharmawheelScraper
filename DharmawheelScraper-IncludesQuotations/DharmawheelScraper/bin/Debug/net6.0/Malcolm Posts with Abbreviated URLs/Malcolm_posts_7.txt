The nominal value of the ruble is not reliable because it is not freely floating as other currencies are.

PeterC said:
That’s a bit of an understatement.  It’s not that long ago that when Russian banks had large nondeliverable forwards on the rubble expiring, they would shift the value of the currency for a couple of days to stiff their counterparties.

But at some level the means by which Russian gas is paid for is not really the issue. The issue for Western Europe is how dependant they are on Russian supply, and for Russia, what options they have to sell the production elsewhere. I’m sure the customers will develop alternative supply options much faster than Russia will develop alternative offtake routes.

Which is essentially what i said! They knowingly continued to purchase Russian gas after the Ruble accounts been opened. Their justification is what you described. Why similar arrangements were not followed with Poland and Hungary? Gazprombank could have opened similar accounts for these two countries, and they could have claimed (as per the lead of the major European counterparts) that its all the exporter internal affairs that have little to do with the legitimacy of what they do in the context of breaking the sanctions! What does their refusal to pay in Ruble exactly mean? does it mean that Russia showed more leniency with major European countries and decided to have different policy/approach with others?
The whole purpose of this is not jack up the ruble. The whole purpose of this is collect dollars and euros, because the assets in dollars and euros of Russia have largely been frozen. 282 billion dollars of Russias foreign reserves, slightly more than half, have been frozen. Why? Because Russia stores most of the foreign reserves in foreign banks.
It coincided with the Ruble recovery nonetheless. From the Russian perspective as i imagine it, Ruble recovery accompanied by having a flow of USD and Euro to fund their imports is not a bad thing.

Malcolm wrote:
Both Poland and Bulgaria’s gas contracts were up at the end of this year, so it appears they have much less incentive to continue buying gas from Russia, and also, Poland has apparently been agitating for alternatives to Russian gas for some years. Hungary is in Putin’s pocket at the moment.

The “recovery” of the ruble is a manipulation, it’s price does not represent its true market value. No one wants to buy the ruble right now at any price. Russia’s energy minister announced today they would pump 18% less oil in 2022.

From TASS:

MOSCOW, April 27. /TASS/. At least ten European companies buying Russian natural gas have already opened accounts at Gazprombank needed to meet Russia’s demand to pay in rubles, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.

According to a source close to Gazprom, 4 have already made payments.

The source added that next settlements for gas will be made after May 15.

On March 31, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree that lays out a new procedure for paying for gas supplies by buyers from unfriendly countries. Now such states must transfer funds in foreign currencies to Gazprombank, which will buy rubles on exchanges and transfer them to special ruble accounts of importers. It is from these accounts payment for deliveries will be made.

Malcolm wrote:
Instead, the whole industry is so impersonal as to make the idea that someone buying meat in a modern market is karmically responsible for the death of the piece of flesh of a slaughtered animal ludicrous. If this is the case then all vegans and vegetarians are karmically responsible for all the animals who died in the cultivation of grain and so on for their meals.

KathyLauren said:
You are certainly entitled you your opinion.  I find your assertion that the customer is not karmically responsible equally ludicrous, for the reasons I stated.

As for the animals that died in the production of vegetarian food, there are two arguments that make it ridiculous to bring it up.  First, that killing is mostly accidental (acknowledging that the use of pesticides is intentional - a good reason to go organic),

Malcolm wrote:
Organic agriculture uses the same amount of pesticides as conventional agriculture, they are just "organic."

KathyLauren said:
and karma involves intention.

Malcolm wrote:
Right, so when an organic farmer uses pesticides, he is killing sentient beings and you are supporting that, so according to your own argument, you are accumulating negative karma.

KathyLauren said:
Secondly, raising animals for slaughter requires ten times the resources per calorie that vegetarian food does, so the accidental and/or intentional killing of rodents and insects is ten times what it is for vegetarian food.  So, for meat eaters to hold that over the heads of vegetarians as an example of how hypocritical we are is, well, ludicrous.

Malcolm wrote:
Making religious arguments about meat vs. veg is stupid. I have already pointed out to you multiple times that health and environmental reasons against eating meat are more sound that tenuous arguments involving karma, harm-reduction, etc. For example, I don't see vegans eschewing the use of plastic in their garments. Yet, arguably the penetration of plastic into the whole food chain, from plankton on up is a serious crisis no one wants to address, largely caused by microfibers in clothing and the breakdown of plastic garbage in the oceans, etc. There is literally plastic in our rain water now.

Hi Ayu, apparently my misunderstanding is due to in the US most Americans like myself think circumcision is the norm for white males.

As far as uncircumcised men in the US, that’s more common from Hispanic backgrounds.

Malcolm wrote:
Candrakīrti asserts that it is. You can take it up with him. You are confusing what arhats and pratyekabuddhas realize with śrāvaka philosophical systems. Both arhats and pratyekabuddhas also realize the absence of inherent existence. There is no other emptiness apart from that, other than a bunch of designations: outer emptiness, inner emptiness, etc., etc.

For example, can you show me a single place in the Madhyamakakārika of Nāgārjuna where he discusses compassion? No, you cannot.

If one wishes for full buddhahood, one must have Mahāyāna bodhicitta; but that is not required for arhatship. This why people are warned that even if their meditation of emptiness is perfect according to Mahāyāna philosophy, if they lack bodhicitta, they will not achieve anything other than the cessation realized by arhats. Nevertheless, such people are liberated, free of affliction, and so on. Not only this, but there is such a thing as nonafflictive ignorance, even some buddhas suffer from it, such as tenth stage bodhisattvas. The only beings who are completely free of nonafflictive ignorance are samyaksambuddhas.

He gave Patrul Rinpoche a direct introduction by beating him up and spitting in his face and calling him an old dog. Was it bad behaviour or was it fortunate for the whole lineage of Longchen Nyingtik?

Malcolm wrote:
The immediate problem here is assuming that every Vajrayāna practitioner is sufficiently ripened to benefit from such treatment and has sufficient faith in their teacher not to flee in terror.

Some western students hear rumors of such antics by Tibetan teachers. They then develop a kind of machismo around tolerating such displays. All I can say is that all of my gurus have been unfailingly kind to all of their students, and never hit, abused, spat upon, yelled at, or beat up anyone. Tibetans have a culture where they tend to give the benefit of the doubt to the teacher. We do not have such a culture, and to the majority of westerners tolerating such behavior looks rather cultish on the face of it. Wise teachers adapt to circumstances.

The adoption of unconventional behavior in India has a lengthy history, even by the 10th century. The Buddha recorded the behavior of ascetics during his day. Such unconventional behavior was well tolerated in the Indian context by the time of the Buddha. At first, the Tibetans were quite shocked by Indian siddhas and their behavior. Everyone forgets that Padmasambhava was not welcomed warmly by all Tibetans. There was considerable pushback to Padmasambhava by Tibetans as the more reliable early histories in which Padmasambhava is mentioned show. At this point, the person of Padmasambhava is lost in myth and legend, and the few contemporary historical glimpses we see of him the Old Tibetan Annals do not portray anything very remarkable.

By 1000 CE, the Tibetans had largely abandoned their old religion, of which only traces remain, and adopted Indian Tantric Buddhism completely, along with the magical wars siddhas were fighting with Hindus. We tend to view all of this anachronistically. But my point is, the notion of who a guru was and how he or she could treat students evolved in Tibetan society over a long period of time based on Indian antecedents. Indian Siddhas were the Marvel superheroes of Tibetan culture. We forget this, and we ought not.

Even so, was also much suspicion of Indian "atsaras" in later times  as well. We have examples of Indian impersonating other more famous Indian teachers, for example, and the general suspicion of Nyingmapas of the time that many of the tantras being brought to Tibet from India were just composed by Indian pandits to rob naive Tibetan translations of gold, etc. But eventually, when the treasure tradition emerged to compete with the new Indian revelations, we see Padmasambhava's myth cycle absorbing the deeds and personas of such famed Indians as Brahmin Vararuci (aka Loden Choksre), etc., and so on.

Thus, when we see teachers bringing up examples of Tilopa and Naropa, Marpa and Milarepa, Do Khyentse and Patrul, we have to remember we are talking about events in cultures not our own, with signifiers which are almost completely alien to the West.

Most nations on earth largely depend on imports, but some goods are considered more strategic than others. Wheat and gas are more essential to survival than electronics. It is also not evident to what extent the sanctions would hamper their ability to import what they need either from China or from India. In a previous post, you mentioned black markets in relation to the real value of the Ruble. When their is a law, there is a shadow. When there are sanctions, there are numerous ways of going around them. Had the law been one sides, all nations that have been subjected to sanctions would have bearished.

Since Putin became the president of Russia, Russia invested more in qualitative weaponry to maintain the balance of deterrence with the west. They invested much less in modernizing conventional weapons except through demonstrating their technological know-how. Add to their latest tanks the SU 57, which is a fifth generation fighter with very limited numbers produced. This would allow them to keep pace with the technological advancement of rival armies until conditions turn into their favor. Previous sanctions did not prevent their military misadventure in Ukraine, even with the less advanced conventional weapons at their disposal, knowing that the west would think twice before interfering directly. The nature of the regime and the collective mindset seems to make them much more tolerant to short term losses than their western counterparts. Same thing can be said about the impact of economic sanctions in my opinion.

Experts say the rest of the rebound is a result of the ruble being artificially propped up by the Russian central bank through capital controls.

"The currency moves don't represent the fundamentals of Russia. More often than not, you see the fundamentals reflected in the currency. But as soon as capital controls are put in place, then that obscures the picture," said Craig Erlam, senior markets analyst at OANDA.
"There's no way you can say the Russian economy now has the same outlook as it did in the middle of February before the invasion started, even if the currency would suggest that," he told DW.
The Russian economy, which the IMF in January forecast would grow 2.8% this year, is now predicted to shrink 10%-15%.

All the arguments against veganism/vegetarianism proposed here are hung on a single rationalization: that two degrees of separation are sufficient to isolate the eater from any karmic consequences of their choice.  As long as the butcher did not know my identity, I am isolated from my role in his act of killing a sentient being.

You all would put it that I have no role in his action, but that is nonsense.  My role is "customer".  The fact that he did not know my identity does not change that.  He is not going to carry on slaughtering animals if he has no customers, so the role of the customer is crucial: it is the reason for the killing.  It is only my anonymity that allegedly isolates me from his actions.  He does the slaughtering for his customers.

I know that rule is based on scripture, but I would submit that the whole "It's okay if the animal wasn't slaughtered specifically for you" thing was a rule for monks obtaining food on their alms rounds, not a rule intended for lay people.  It is to make the life of begging monks and the householders who support them a bit easier.

If you take it as a general rule, you could use the same logic to justify all kinds of abuse of the Precepts.  If I wanted to obtain a rare and valuable jewel, I could ask a friend to hire a thief to steal it.  As long as the friend didn't tell the thief who it was for, I wouldn't be guilty of stealing.  Same logic.

Malcolm wrote:
No, it is not the same logic.

Your thought experiment requires you to ask someone to ask someone to steal a book.

In this case, no one is asking anyone to do anything. The grocer is not my friend, etc. If I asked the grocer to ask the butcher to slaughter an animal so I could lay up a side of beef, then it would be the same. But since that is not the case, it is not the same.

Instead, the whole industry is so impersonal as to make the idea that someone buying meat in a modern market is karmically responsible for the death of the piece of flesh of a slaughtered animal ludicrous. If this is the case then all vegans and vegetarians are karmically responsible for all the animals who died in the cultivation of grain and so on for their meals. One cannot exercise a double standard here, and claim one bears more karmic weight than the other. Either all bear karmic weight or none do, when it comes to deaths cause by agriculture.

And I’m unclear why/how a volitional act having more than one ‘fruit’ creates the problem of cause and effect happening simultaneously. Can you explain that?

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, it means that a cause will persist beyond its result, produce a second result, ad infinitum. If a cause were to produce more than one result, those results would all have to happen simultaneously, for example a seed would have to produce more than one plant. You might argue, well, plants produce many seeds and that's an example of one cause producing many results. However, this is not the case. Plants are complex sets of causes and conditions, and any complex set of multiple causes and conditions can produce multiple results. But when you carefully examine you will see that the causes for each individual seed are exhausted when that seed is produced, etc.

Buddha also taught, “When consciousness descends into the womb…” from where does that consciousness come?

clyde said:
In reading Thanissaro Bhikku’s polemic, The Truth of Rebirth, I came across the reference to “a descent of an embryo”. Here is the passage:
“Monks, the descent of the embryo occurs with the union of three things. There is the case where there is no union of the mother & father, the mother is not in her season, and a gandhabba [the being-to-be-born] is not present, nor is there a descent of an embryo. There is the case where there is a union of the mother & father, and the mother is in her season, but a gandhabba is not present, nor is there a descent of an embryo. But when there is a union of the mother & father, the mother is in her season, and a gandhabba is present, then with this union of three things the descent of the embryo occurs.” — MN 38
Is this passage what you were referring to or was it another?

What is a “gandhabba”, “the being-to-be-born”? And where is it?

Malcolm wrote:
I was actually referring to the Mahānidanasutta, but this will serve. The gandharava (lit. smell eater) is a technical term for a being in the intermediate period between this life and the next life. The Theravadins don't accept the Buddha's teachings on the gandharva. They assert that the moment one's stream of consciousness separates from the body of this life, it immediately appropriates the body of the next life. Other schools accept the Buddha's teaching of the gandharva and maintain that the gandharva goes through seven successive births in the intermediate state over a period of forty-nine days until it appropriates the body of the next life. The point is that in order for conception to occur, there must. be three things present: sperm, ovum, and a consciousness craving birth.

Clearly karma is central to rebirth. How do you understand karma? It’s often called the principle of cause-and-effect. That’s not a thing and it’s not a scorecard; it’s a description of an ongoing process.

But how do you see it? Is there “personal karma” and if so, how is that? Does karma accumulate? And is karma-and-the-fruits-of-karma based on our notions of justice?

Malcolm wrote:
Karma (action) is intention/volition (cetana) and what proceeds from intention/volition. That is how the Buddha described it, as well as Nāgārjuna and Vasubandhu.

That is why it is "personal," as the ripening of these intentions will only take place on the same mind stream that generated them, and in the same realm as they were generated. In other words, actions in the desire realm will only ripen in the desire realm, and so on.

Karma is not a law of cause and effect. Causes and effects are treated separately and before we get to karma. Actually, in Abhidharma it is presented very logically. Cause and effect are presented first, then dependent origination, then karma, and then afflictions.

clyde said:
I’ve not studied the Abhidharma. When you say that it presents cause-and-effect, DO, and karma in that order, does that mean that DO is dependent on cause-and-effect, and that karma is dependent on DO?

Malcolm wrote:
It means that general causes and effects, both animate and inanimate, are covered under the six causes and four conditions, or alternately, the 24 conditions of Abhidhamma. Dependent origination concerns the causation of sentient beings specifically. Karma concerns the causation of higher and lower status in samsara based on virtuous and nonvirtuous actions.

clyde said:
I understand karma-and-the-fruits-of-karma as the natural workings of the unfolding world to which my actions contribute like a ripple emanating out.

Malcolm wrote:
This not the Buddha's teaching on karma, not even remotely.

The way it is put in Abhidharma is this:

The variety of the world is due to action. 
Action is volition and what proceeds from volition.

Because we act, we cause changes in and on the world. They are not natural unfoldings, if you will. All change in the world is due to the action of sentient beings. Even the formation of the universe is caused by the actions of all the sentient beings, ripening from the last universe to cause this on.

Schrödinger’s Yidam said:
As was mentioned earlier, in Mahayana doctrine that which goes from one life to another is the alaya vujnana, the “all-base consciousness”, also known as the 8th consciousness. It is called all-base because it holds the metaphorical “seeds” of karma which ripen later as experience. This consciousness is not found in the Suttas, which is why the subject is complicated in the Hinayana.

No. Asanga cites the Theravavad bhavanga consciousness or linking consciousness in defense of this notion. It is not accepted in Madhyamaka, generally speaking.

Basically, nothing transfers per se. The last moment of consciousness of this life is the cause of the first moment of consciousness of the next.

Malcolm wrote:
The current levels of Inflation are worldwide and have nothing to do with US monetary policy. Its cause is pandemic supply chain disruption and energy panic due to the war in Ukraine and the burgeoning process isolating Russia economically.

Also, the idea that the dollar's days as a reserve currency are limited has been forecast for years. Someday maybe it will happen, but that would require another country's economy to match ours in size. Even the euro is not as flexible as the dollar, because the EU does not have the same flexibility as the US. The main issue is convertability.

It takes a long time for people with power to come around and fear the power they wield. The Enlightenment out of which the ideas underlying the establishment of the United States emerged were forged over centuries under the despotic rule of kings. Those people had visceral living memories of arbitrary rulers where life and property could be taken at whim of select individuals and developed a philosophical framework, alongside an ancient form of the Rule of Law, the Common Law (arguably a vestige of rule from a time that was more egalitarian and organic, before the development of despotic monarchies), that was and continues to be a living tradition in the Anglophile world. A class that wields real power must come to fear the power they wield and agree to a system where power can be checked.

Based on my study of history, human beings will tolerate a lot of injustice and cruelty as long as they are personally comfortable, and people are willing to compromise their expectations of comfort to a pathetic degree to avoid conflict. Rarely do you see people stick their necks out for others. And so, psychopaths and other assorted people with deformed characters take advantage to seize for themselves when there are no systems of checks or people become so apathetic that they don't bother using systems of checks that have been established.

If mental consciousness has its basis in the heart, then when death and dissolution of the body occurs, each sense organ ceases to function and the consciousness associated with the sense organ ceases; i.e., all consciousness associated with the body ceases.

Google says it is to help you quickly find the pages you're looking for. What it does, though, is create your own personal echo-chamber, media world or whatever you call it. So if you like Q-anon or Kabbala or Kropotkin, just for random examples, those will be your top results. So you click on them first, and Google knows you like pages like that, and serves up even more next time. Yep, vicious circle.
What does Google get out of it? $$$$$, since the process incidentally creates beautifully targeted marketing niches which Google can then offer to advertisers at a premium.

Anyway, lots of words. I, personally, would have to basically ideally talk with Wallace to assess his thought, or at the very least get to know it well. And maybe I shouldn't be talking at all here since I do not know his thought well, and maybe he is mistaken. But again, I have appreciated his translations of Dudjom Lingpa, which I find valuable.

Malcolm wrote:
The difference here is that as you point out, the Dudjom Nyingma philosophy book was translated, and it was translated many years ago. I respect the translators who did it, but we are so far beyond these early attempts (and yes, it is a translation that is 40+ years old), and we know a lot more about what is in the earlier strata of Dzogchen texts, such as the lengthy pre-Longchenpa commentaries on Dzogchen tantras in which I specialize. There has been a lot of contamination by western philosophical concepts in these earlier attempts, and much of that contamination has yet to be weeded out. Wallace's understanding of Dzogchen is crypto-theistic, in that he has fairly openly states that he thinks that the mythos of Samantabhadra's awakening is an ex nihilo cosmogony:

Seeker12 said:
While Buddhism is deemed nontheistic, the Vedas are regarded as polytheistic, and the Bible is monotheistic, we have seen that the cosmogonies of Vajrayana Buddhism, Vedanta, and Neoplatonic Christianity have so much in common that they could almost be regarded as varying interpretations of a single theory. Moreover, the commonality does not end there, for in the Near East, the writings of Plotinus (205-270) also influenced Islamic and Jewish theories of creation. This apparent unity could be attributed to mere coincidence, or to the historical propagation of a single, speculative, metaphysical theory throughout south Asia and the Near East. For example, the Upanishads may well have influenced the writings of early Mahayana thinkers in India, and they could also have made their way to the Near East, where they might have inspired the writings of Plotinus. On the other hand, Plotinus declared that his theories were based on his own experiential insights, and similar claims have been made by many Buddhist and Vedantin contemplatives. If these cosmogonies are indeed based upon valid introspective knowledge, then there may some plausibility to the claims of many contemplatives throughout the world that introspective inquiry can lead to knowledge, not only of the ultimate ground of being, but of the fundamental laws of nature as well.

Malcolm wrote:
Wallace is so completely wrong here, it is cannot be explained by anything other than the fact that he has not properly studied Dzogchen teachings in depth. There is absolutely nothing in common with the Dzogchen account of cosmogony and those of Hinduism and neoplatonism. Nothing at all. Dzogchen cosmogony is simply a variation on the the cyclical cosmogony of the Abdharmakoṣabhaśya, and I can prove it.

Per Wikipedia this comes from The Crystal and the Way of Light.

Malcolm wrote:
Ok, well, you have to understand that everything in Crystal came from an early period in ChNN's career, when he was not teaching in English. At this time, he used various English translators such as John Shane, Barry Simmons, and so on, before ChNN switched over to teaching in English directly around 1988, the same year Crystal came out. So we cannot regard it as a definitive representation of ChNN's intent, since it is an edited transcript of translation from his original Italian. It broadly served as a introduction to his teachings, but was never intended to be a definitive statement of them. But more importantly, there is no such term in Dzogchen as "the fundamental ground of existence." The term "gzhi" refers to your own nature which you have failed to recognize. That's it. It is not a "ground of being" as in Paul Tillich's theology, where the term originates:

For Tillich, God is being-itself, not a being among other beings. To describe the relationship between being-itself and finite beings, Tillich takes the word, "ground." For Tillich, God is the ground of being, the ground of the structure of being. God as being itself is the ground of the ontological structure of being. In other words, every ontological being has its power to be in being itself, participate in the ground of being. All accounts of God are expressed through what we comprehend. Can we know God? For Tilich, the answer is clear: we can. Adopting the theory of analogia entis (analogy of being), that is, "that which is infinite is being itself and because everything participates in being itself" (239), The theory of analogia entis explains the possibility of knowing and saying anything about God. However, for Tillich, the analogia entis justifies our ways of saying about God only under a fact that "God must be understood as being itself" (240). Thus, existential approach to God through the category of finitude must be described symbolically. God is the ground of being, being-itself; who concerns us ultimately. Thus, God is our ultimate concern.
https://people.bu.edu/wwildman/bce/tillich.htm

There is no such ground of being in the whole length and breadth of buddhadharma, including Dzogchen teachings.

Also, Rufo is a conservative activist whose mission is life is to misrepresent CRT deliberately as anti-American, since he thinks it is a better meme than "cancel culture" or "PC." https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-o ... ace-theory

"As Rufo eventually came to see it, conservatives engaged in the culture war had been fighting against the same progressive racial ideology since late in the Obama years, without ever being able to describe it effectively. “We’ve needed new language for these issues,” Rufo told me, when I first wrote to him, late in May. “ ‘Political correctness’ is a dated term and, more importantly, doesn’t apply anymore. It’s not that elites are enforcing a set of manners and cultural limits, they’re seeking to reengineer the foundation of human psychology and social institutions through the new politics of race, It’s much more invasive than mere ‘correctness,’ which is a mechanism of social control, but not the heart of what’s happening. The other frames are wrong, too: ‘cancel culture’ is a vacuous term and doesn’t translate into a political program; ‘woke’ is a good epithet, but it’s too broad, too terminal, too easily brushed aside. ‘Critical race theory’ is the perfect villain,” Rufo wrote.

He thought that the phrase was a better description of what conservatives were opposing, but it also seemed like a promising political weapon. “Its connotations are all negative to most middle-class Americans, including racial minorities, who see the world as ‘creative’ rather than ‘critical,’ ‘individual’ rather than ‘racial,’ ‘practical’ rather than ‘theoretical.’ Strung together, the phrase ‘critical race theory’ connotes hostile, academic, divisive, race-obsessed, poisonous, elitist, anti-American.” Most perfect of all, Rufo continued, critical race theory is not “an externally applied pejorative.” Instead, “it’s the label the critical race theorists chose themselves.”

What we understand today as "democracy" was forged in the fire of the American revolution. Essentially, all states have systems of transferring power. Democracy, like Monarchy, etc., is just one of those systems. It also happens to be the rarest form of government in history. One thing you will notice is that liberal democracies never invade or fight wars with other liberal democracies. Liberal democratic countries tend to stick together.

My argument is simple-- liberal democracy in general is the ideal government under which Dharma can flourish. That does not mean that we have to have elections in sanghas, etc. It just means that liberal democracies are places where Buddhists enjoy the most freedom. This is very clear when you examine the state of Buddhism in the world today.

It's a precept also observed by lay people during uposatha/sabbath:

‘As long as they live, the perfected ones eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and from food at the wrong time. I, too, for this day and night will eat in one part of the day, abstaining from eating at night and food at the wrong time.

Malcolm wrote:
You have to read the article. Basically, he argues, correctly, that the bar was set so high in the nikaya and agama tradition that no one could have thought of themselves as bodhisattva until the advent of sutras like the Aṣṭasāhasrikā. However, this is obvious from traditional Mahāyāna accounts as well, where it is fully acknowledged that Mahāyāna sūtras only began to circulate hundreds of years after the Buddha's passing, having been gathered and arranged in S. India by Mañjuśrī, etc., and then "published."

For example, he points out that the reason one knows one is an irreversible bodhisattva is that one when one hears a text like Aṣṭasāhasrikā, one is not afraid, one sheds tears upon the mention of emptiness, and so on. All these things occurred for me personally, when I first read the Aṣṭasāhasrikā. It moved me in a way that Nāgārjuna did not, though Nāgārjuna blew me away at 24 years of age and set me firmly on this path. Also Nāgārjuna points out in the Ratnavali that the agamas do not teach the bodhisattva path, well, because they do not. If one wants to follow the bodhisattva path, one must follow the Mahāyāna.

Malcolm wrote:
Gender is an illusion, albeit, a powerful one:

Śāriputra: Goddess, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?

Goddess: Although I have sought my “female state” for these twelve years, I have not yet found it. Reverend Śāriputra, if a magician were to incarnate a woman by magic, would you ask her, “What prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?”

Śāriputra: No! Such a woman would not really exist, so what would there be to transform?

Goddess: Just so, reverend Śāriputra, all things do not really exist. Now, would you think, “What prevents one whose nature is that of a magical incarnation from transforming herself out of her female state?”

Thereupon, the goddess employed her magical power to cause the elder Śāriputra to appear in her form and to cause herself to appear in his form. Then the goddess, transformed into Śāriputra, said to Śāriputra, transformed into a goddess, “Reverend Śāriputra, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?”

And Śāriputra, transformed into the goddess, replied, “I no longer appear in the form of a male! My body has changed into the body of a woman! I do not know what to transform!”

The goddess continued, “If the elder could again change out of the female state, then all women could also change out of their female states. All women appear in the form of women in just the same way as the elder appears in the form of a woman. While they are not women in reality, they appear in the form of women. With this in mind, the Buddha said, ‘In all things, there is neither male nor female.’ ”

Then, the goddess released her magical power and each returned to his ordinary form. She then said to him, “Reverend Śāriputra, what have you done with your female form?”

From a Mahāyāna point of view, vinaya and abhidharma are provisional. According to Nāgārjuna, śrāvaka sūtras do not teach the bodhisattva path and the means to attain buddhahood.

From the point of view of secret mantra, common Mahāyāna does not teach the path of attaining buddhahood in a single lifetime, soup to nuts.

Buddhanature, in one aspect, is the liberative tendency/capacity in all activity that irrepressibly 'expresses' in due course if one is turned on to the Buddha nature and stops agitating. Hence the need for shamatha practice. Vipashyana follows with the practice of clarity. Like the sky and light.

It is regarded as an Ekayāna sūtra, meaning that it is a source for the idea that there is really only one Buddhist path.

There is no detailed commentarial tradition on the Lotus. It is frequently cited mainly with respect to its assertion that the Buddha will manifest in the future as gurus.

The only detailed treatment of the Lotus I have ever seen in Tibetan is a review of the parable of the Nāga princess by Chogyal Phakpa, who clarifies that she was already a bodhisattva abiding on the tenth stage, which is why her transformation into a male and subsequent buddhahood could be so rapid. He probably wrote this in response to Chinese Buddhists pointing out this example as proof of sudden awakening.

Compassion, loving kindness, good will are all always Buddha-dharma. Compassion is present in many other paths, but is still never not Buddha-dharma.

If you make this argument, then by definition, buying anything from a supermarket is necessarily implicated in the slaughter of animals. Supporting a CSA that raises animals implicates one in their exploitation even if one never purchases milk or meat from that CSA, etc., etc.

Malcolm wrote:
Animals regularly ignore each other's interests. I've seen many spiders ignore the interests of the flies they catch, many birds ignore the interests of the bugs they eat, etc., etc.

Humans ignore the "interests" of animals because most humans view animals as food sources, etc.

On the other hand, domestic animals survive where wild animals do not, and in fact, enjoy protection from predation by wild animals because they are domesticated. This why there are so few big cats, wolves, and other large predators in the world. They've been hunted down to protect domestic animals (and for fur, and so on).

For example, supposing we stopped relying on cows, pigs, chickens, sheep, and goats for meat and dairy. How long to do you think these animals would survive as species? Are we just going to allow them to roam free on the earth, multiplying and living wherever they like? Not very likely. No, they will be culled to keep down their populations. Already, deer populations are a problem because there are no natural predators for deer and we don't hunt deer so much anymore. Even the culling programs are not effective. So, will it be in the interest of these former domestic animals to simply let them run free? You can talk all you like about the interest of animals, but I don't see any serious discussion of what is to happen to all these billions of domesticated animals once they have been freed to live their best lives as wild animals.

The Buddhist reason for this is that while the Buddha defined killing humans a complete monastic downfall, killing an animal is a fault at the same level as drinking alcohol, picking leaves off plants, etc.

It was Devadatta, of course, who insisted on absolute vegetarianism. But we know what happened to him.

And quite frankly, when someone eats meat they are not harming any creature at all. There is no consciousness in a piece of meat to be harmed, whether it is the meat of a human, cow, etc. But we have taboos against eating humans, as well as predators. The Buddha forbids the consuming of such kinds of meat in Vinaya.

If someone is a strict common Mahāyāna practitioner, they should avoid eating meat. But if they are a Theravadin or a Vajrayāna practitioner, there is no need to avoid eating meat, because the consumption of meat is permitted in Hinayāna and Vajrayāna.

Sustainable agriculture requires animal inputs, from manure, various kinds of bone, blood, and feather meal, if we going to feed the entire planet without chemical fertilizers, etc.

Not against vegetarians and vegans per se, just against poor arguments, such as excusing the wholesale slaughter of insects, rodents, birds, and so on to grow crops for humans, etc., as if vegetarianism and veganism are ethically disengaged in such taking of life.

There are cogent arguments to be made for changing industrial agriculture, and so on, but the simple fact of the matter is that the relationship between animals and crops is essential. We cannot keep poisoning the planet with chemical fertilizers made from oil. If we study the history of food security we will discover two key features in solving food security around the world also led to the rise of industrial agriculture. During the Colombian exchange,  potatoes and yams, one key spread to Europe and Asia, and effectively ended food insecurity in these place, with the other key, guano mines in Peru, which were replaced by the invention of chemical fertilizers in the late 19th century. The inputs of oil into our food system, globally, also caused a massive rise in population. Unless people think that continuing to use chemical fertilizers is a good idea (it isn't, since it contributing to dead zones in coastal areas), continued reliance on animals for fertilizer etc., is not going to change.

But our global food economy is basically hooked on the meth of petroleum.

The simple fact of the matter is that in our world life feeds on death. This also needs to be taken into account. Everything we do is harmful to something else.

RiFF said:
Not trying to make any judgments, trying to gain an understanding. I've been vegan for several years and recently I have become a student of the dharma. Initially my veganism had nothing to do with Buddhism aside from thinking I was fortunate to already be on this diet rather than have to make any major change as a result of what I was reading.

However, more recently I've gotten deeper into Tibetan Buddhism, and to my surprise vegetarianism is not nearly as prominent and in fact it might not even be possible to follow certain Tibetan Buddhist traditions? I understand HHDL is not vegetarian, nor are many Tibetan masters. I've also found out that for certain holidays, meat eating is expected.

How does one reconcile a true belief in compassion for all beings with the meat industry? When it is fully possible for HHDL to have vegan food for every meal, how does he justify choosing to consume an animal?

I understand that in agriculture, there is still cruelty as field mice can get killed, as can bugs and other small critters. However there is a significant difference in the amount of suffering in something like factory farming vs. inadvertent death caused by farming. I'm not trying to get into a debate of vegan vs. not vegan, I just want to understand is there something that Tibetan Buddhists are able to point to in order to explain why their purchase of meat products does not cause suffering on their fellow sentient beings.

Malcolm wrote:
Meat, wool, and leather do not suffer, since there is no mind in these products.

As long as one did not kill an animal oneself, see it killed, nor was the animal killed expressly for oneself personally, that meat is considered suitable for consumption.

There is a huge thread on the ethics of meat-eating here on the board.

It's also misleading in that, to most westerners, the 'soul' is one part of the 'self', very like the 'ego' or the 'conscience' and somewhat like the nose or foot.

For both those reasons, I prefer 'not-self' to 'no-self'. It's a bit awkward-looking but any questions it raises are more easily answered in the right framework: this is not self, that is not self, the self does not exist in the way we assume it does, etc.
'No-self', on the other hand, needs a complicated work-around on the lines of, "Well, yes, I have to admit that you do exist but..."
'No-soul', similarly, looks like a straight materialist-atheist stance, which then has to be denied before any progress can be made.

And all of those points apply (for most of us, to some extent) when we are talking to ourselves as well as when we're talking to another person.

In order to prove it, you would have to be able to trace the continuum of a mind from one deceased body to the conception of another.

Otherwise, what's the empowerment for? What's the guru for? What's the point of the guru having a proper lineage? In what sense has the initiate received the blessing of the deity?

Malcolm wrote:
Speaking strictly from the point of view of Dzogchen, empowerment is for inducing the experience of the example/actual wisdom. The guru is the guide who assists the student induce that experience. The lineage means that guru has also been lead through the process in a precise way by someone else before them. Not all empowerments involve deities. In fact, the actual Dzogchen empowerments never do. Dzogchen empowerment can be combined with deity empowerments, but it is not necessary.

Except, perhaps, doctrines (theories) regarding the nature of awareness itself, which were being developed by people at Nalanda University in India From the 5th through the 12th centuries, when they weren’t busy developing theories about particle physics… you know, just before Europe entered the dark ages.

More to the point however, is that if one can remove karma and rebirth from Buddhism, and still call it Buddhism simply because that’s how one chooses to define Buddhism, then it should be equally valid to add karma and rebirth to the sciences, and regard them as science, for the same reason. Might as well throw in astrology too.

Perhaps this thread should be about the future of science, and whether it will expand to include pseudoscience.

tobes said:
Great point. The question is: who gets to define a. science and b. Buddhadharma?

There is a degree of contestation in both, but it is a matter of degrees. No one thinks that theologians or advertising executives have a legitimate stake in the business of defining what science is or isn't.

Likewise the notion that so called 'hard science' has any stake in the business of defining Buddhadharma is as absurd as thinking they have a stake in defining economics or history or any other area of human knowledge and culture.

Malcolm wrote:
“Science” exists as empirical knowledge. That’s it. Nothing more, nothing less. Most Western Buddhists accept it without question. Science, being empirical, also has limitations, because not all knowledge is empirical, such as belief systems, including belief systems about science.

Buddhists accept certain kinds of nonempirical knowledge. The most important of these are the causes of suffering, suffering itself being birth in the three realms. Anyone who properly understands Buddhadharma understands that affliction-driven action is the cause of suffering. And suffering only ceases if affliction-driven action ceases because affliction-driven action causes birth in samsara. All that liberation is, is freedom from birth in samsara due to affliction-driven action. There is no liberation taught by the Buddha other than that.

This is all very, very elementary, Buddhism 101:

clyde said:
Then the wanderer Vacchagotta went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there he asked the Blessed One: "Now then, Venerable Gotama, is there a self?"

When this was said, the Blessed One was silent.

"Then is there no self?"

A second time, the Blessed One was silent.

Then Vacchagotta the wanderer got up from his seat and left.

Then, not long after Vacchagotta the wanderer had left, Ven. Ananda said to the Blessed One, "Why, lord, did the Blessed One not answer when asked a question by Vacchagotta the wanderer?"

"Ananda, if I — being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self — were to answer that there is a self, that would be conforming with those brahmans & contemplatives who are exponents of eternalism [the view that there is an eternal, unchanging soul]. If I — being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self — were to answer that there is no self, that would be conforming with those brahmans & contemplatives who are exponents of annihilationism [the view that death is the annihilation of consciousness]. If I — being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is a self — were to answer that there is a self, would that be in keeping with the arising of knowledge that all phenomena are not-self?"

"No, lord."

"And if I — being asked by Vacchagotta the wanderer if there is no self — were to answer that there is no self, the bewildered Vacchagotta would become even more bewildered: 'Does the self I used to have now not exist?'"

These people are secular humanists who like to sit on cushions and practice śamatha, and that is all they are or ever will be, as long as they do not address the fundamental question the Buddha solved. There is no liberation apart from eradication of the afflictions that cause rebirth in the three realms. Any other kind of liberation is not the liberation the Buddha taught.

This formula was uttered by the Buddha in response to the question of some monks past lives. Buddhas response here should be taken to mean, when there is affliction, there is karma, etc.

That's exactly the sort of view that arises from self. Suffering is infinite, only because beings are infinite. There is no transmigration of a soul, there is no rebirth that happens in such a way that the precise elements and conditions creating any single individual are continued into a 'new life'.

Delusion is present in every sentient being, sentient beings arise because of delusion. Rebirth is the process of continuing confusion/bondage.

Delusion/bondage/suffering isn't a soul.

Lower tantra practice, however, is vegetarian oriented, and plenty of people in Tibetan Buddhism don’t practice HYT.

But HYT and Nyingma inner tantra cannot be practiced by people with ideological food preferences, no matter how noble their intentions may be.

But the monkhood’s pious image has been increasingly eroded in recent years with a series of high-profile arrests and scandals.

Barely a week goes by without reports of monks charged with money laundering, drunk driving, drug trafficking and even murder—rocking the clergy’s reputation in Thailand with each new headline.

Of course, we can't really discuss this in soundbites, but it is a conservative myth that we bankrupted the USSR into nonexistence. Reagan walked back his aggressive tone and chose to be chummy with Gorbachev. That set the stage for Bush's administration relationship with the USSR:

Crazywisdom said:
Indeed, many conservative commentators would prefer to sweep these historical nuances under the rug. These realities also directly contradict a deeply ideological (and ahistorical) narrative that – short of war – massive defense buildups, bellicosity and tough talk bring authoritarian regimes to their knees.

With access to thousands of pages of Soviet records, oral histories and memoirs, we now know that the confrontational approach that defined Reagan’s first few years in office had very little, if any, impact on Soviet strategic decisionmaking. In fact, the antagonism of Reagan’s early presidency likely prolonged the Cold War by elevating hardline, anti-American voices over those of moderate reformers like Gorbachev.

Reagan’s true Cold War legacy is rooted in his deeply personal diplomatic engagement with Gorbachev. Reagan’s embrace of Gorbachev and praise for his reforms gave the Soviet leader the latitude to enact the political and social changes – perestroika, glasnost, demokratizatsiya – that ultimately caused the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Malcolm wrote:
It wasn't Biden's hasty exit, the time table was set by the previous administration. In fact, Biden wanted to Obama to limit our involvement in Afghanistan in 2009:

Crazywisdom said:
In 2009, the new Obama administration debated whether to “surge” troop levels in Afghanistan after nearly eight years of war had failed to quell the insurgency from the overthrown Taliban forces. Top generals asked early that year for 17,000 more US troops and then, having gotten those, asked for an additional 40,000 to try to weaken the Taliban and strengthen the Afghan government.

Then-Vice President Biden was consistently one of the biggest skeptics of the military’s recommendations. Throughout months of debate, he repeatedly raised the inconvenient point that the generals’ preferred strategy seemed extremely unlikely to lead to actual victory. “We have not thought through our strategic goals!” he shouted during the Obama administration’s first meeting on the war in Afghanistan.

All this was documented at the time in Bob Woodward’s deeply reported 2010 book Obama’s Wars. Biden did not actually support withdrawal at the time — he pushed for a more limited mission focused on counterterrorism, accompanied by a smaller troop surge than the military wanted.

...

Building a functioning nation-state in Afghanistan was impossible. Woodward writes that during one October meeting, Biden asked the generals, “If the government’s a criminal syndicate a year from now, how will troops make a difference?” He followed up with, “If a year from now there is no demonstrable progress in governance, what do we do?” He didn’t receive a convincing answer to either question.

Later on, he wrote memos to Obama arguing for “no full counterinsurgency” and “no nation-building.” He thought the military’s goals of strengthening Afghanistan’s military and police force were doomed. And he said the following at a meeting with National Security Council leaders, per Woodward:

"Historically, [Biden] said, it’s been very difficult—impossible—for foreign interventions to prevail in Afghanistan. With tens of thousands of troops on the ground already, if we can’t do it with this number and we don’t have a reliable partner in the Afghanistan government, then it seems irresponsible to inject additional troops on top of that. We’re just prolonging failure at that point, he said."

Malcolm wrote:
In order to make the exit "softer," Biden would have had to recommit troops, prolonging our involvement by a year. Face it, no exit would have been pretty after Trump cut the Afghan gvt. off below the knees. Afghan troops literally dropped their weapons in the streets.

Biden is not a dummy, nor is he demented, nor is he addled. As the VP, he observed our failure after failure in Afghanistan for eight years, and consistently argued for policies that Obama and the Pentagon would not follow. Had they taken Biden's recommendations, it would have all ended considerably differently, but probably no less messier. The mistake was Bush's for going in in the first place.

Biden's comment might have alarmed the Neville Chamberlains of the world, but he was right to make it.

"Asian" is a Western idea in the first place. It's a massive simplification of huge cultural differences.  Nobody would think a Dane culturally similar to an American, but the differences between countries in Asia are far greater than that.  Does he think, for instance, that a South Korean has moral authority to have opinions on, say, Bangladesh, in a way that a Norwegian doesn't?  His statements on these issues are extremely simplistic and haven't really progressed past Lee Kuan Yew circa 1990.  His letter to Aung Sang Suu Kyi was terrible - he was (a) trying to assert himself as an authority on "Asianness", and (b) presuming to advise someone who runs a country (albeit badly) on how to handle cultural diplomacy.  Totally out of his depth.  He should leave commentary on this to people who actually know what they're talking about, and focus on the Dharma, on which by all accounts he really does know what he's talking out.

Malcolm wrote:
DJKR's has made a number of fallacious historical claims, but perhaps the most telling historical gaffe was the one where he attributed the decline of Buddhism in Japan to Americans after WWII. I pointed out to him that the decline of Buddhism in Japan was a function of the Meiji restoration, where 45k Buddhist temples were destroyed by the Japanese gvt. in the late 19th century, etc.

LKY's problem (among others) is that he thought the US was trying to foist democracy off on everyone. The actual fact is that during the Cold War, that US was saying to countries: "If you want to do business with us, and have access to our markets, you can't do business with the Communists governments. If you decide to implement liberal democracy, so much the better, but at minimum you can't do business with Communists. If your country already has significant access to Western capital investment, and you try to align with the Communists and nationalize our investments in your country, we are going to take your government down and replace it with someone who better aligns with our interests and will protect our capital investments."

The failures in US foreign policy after the Cold War mainly come from this line of reasoning: "Communism will inevitably fail. It failed in Russia and it will fail in China. We should do business with Russia and China based on this assumption. The only thing we have to worry about now are the recalcitrant Muslim countries, who are state sponsors for terrorism. Liberal democracy driven capitalist development is inevitable. Resistance is futile."

The difference is pragmatism. Our Cold War foreign policy was pragmatic, occasionally dressed up in ideology. Our Post-Cold War foreign policy has been ideological, and abandoned pragmatism for slogans.

Under the Shah, Parsees were invited back from India, Bahais, Jews and Christians allowed to freely worship, etc., and the power of Muslim clerics was curtailed. Women did not wear the hijab, they wore dresses, one could buy wine, etc., and after the overthrow of Mossadegh with the help of the CIA and British intelligence, Iran continued to westernize. One of my friends was the late Prince Ali Reza. Most people really do not know the story of the revolution. I still have friends close to the Shah who left for France after the revolution. Despite the Shah's use of secret police to suppress the opposition, the Shah was progressive and pro-Western. The problem with the Shah was the problem all monarchies face. He had no good plan of succession, his kids were too young, and Iran was no longer a constitutional monarchy. The Iranian revolution set back the development of Iran by decades. Iran was the closest US ally in the region before the revolution.

The Iraq war against Iran was eventually backed by the US, but not enthusiastically. The decision was taken by the G7 to support other friendly Arab states, the main concern being that the war might spread throughout the middle east. Both Iraq and Iran were supporting terrorist groups, and Iraq used chemical weapons against Iran and the Kurds (an Iranian speaking people) many times. Shortly after the Irag/Iran war was over, Iraq invaded Kuwait for "cheating," it was a bedouin raid with tanks, jeeps, and APCs. Naturally, we punished Iraq. The UN levied very harsh sanctions against Iraq (which for some bizarre reason everyone blames Albright for, well because they are idiots who don't know history), and Wolfowitz and crew, managed to convince Bush II that Hussein was linked to Al-Qaeda.

You have to recognize, Magnus, that he has set himself up for criticism by being so vocal in his opinions. There are many Tibetans who really don't like him either, because he has criticized the Dalai Lama by criticizing the Dalai Lama's emphasis on Nalanda masters. So, pick a controversial guru, you get controversy. A lot of Tibetans (like Dzongsar) don't like ChNN, even now. He was also controversial in his day, especially when he was writing in the 1970's. Much of that is because the book that was recently published, Necklace of Jewels where he first began to synthesize his deconstruction of the imperial era myths about the nonexistence of Tibetan culture before the introduction of Buddhism, etc.

Pick a controversial guru, you are going to hear a lot of people voice criticisms of that guru. It's natural. But it is not fatal. And it does not negate that person's positive contributions. For example, the 84000 project, as I mentioned before this, is a very good use of DJKR's title and money.

The funny thing to me is that he advocates for a so-called "realist" position (which is fundamentally amoral). But he seemingly has no understanding at all of the benefits he has received from liberal internationalism. The British Empire produced modern Indian democracy and Bhutanese democracy, where English is the defacto language of government and bureaucracy. When Tibet fell, where did the Tibetan Buddhist establishment move? India. He was born in Bhutan, a protectorate of Britain, originally. The Dalai Lama is strong advocate of liberal democracy.

He is also not a Bond villain. He is motivated by a Christian fascist ideology (Ivan Ilyin) supported by a fascist movement in Russia. It's unlikely he will use tactical nukes. There are layers of command between him and Russia's strategic nukes. Remember Mark Milley's comments to Pelosi about Trump's access to nukes? It is the same in Russia.

So far, the Russian command structure has been compromised electronically. Their vaunted secure communications system uses 3g. They blew up all the 3g towers in Eastern Ukraine. This is why they switched to using Iphones, enabling everyone to listen in on their communications. If they plan on using tactical nukes, we will know about it right away, before they use them. They will use chemical weapons before they use nukes. They've already used phosphorus. In short, we know what the Russians are planning, and when they are going to move.

You are correct that we have the upper hand. But we need to end this now, for Ukraine, and drive the Russians back into the Russia, and continue to crush them so Russian Federation falls apart. In my opinion, Russia has lost the right to be a federation.

The problem with my hypothetical is that not all translations are equal. But let’s leave that to one side for now.

Yes. Unless there is some text or commentary in there or addition that is not available elsewhere. The Heart Sutra is the Heart Sutra. Another text like a commentary is a different story.

I made the cost of choosing the alternative zero in the hypothetical - so clearly you value the possibility of acting against the wishes of a well-respected and important lama at zero.  That is a curious choice.

Counter example. Kunzang Dechen Lingpa taught Khenpo Ngakchung’s Thogal Zintri despite not having received the lung. Why? His explanation was it was just thogal, little different than what was in Yeshe Lama.

We forget that Dzogchen is an intimate instruction that does not come from a text. We also forget that these texts are extremely repetitive. If you’ve read the four Dzogchen treasuries of Longchenpa, you’ve pretty much read everything one needs to practice, providing one is under the guidance of a qualified teacher. There isn’t one single thing in Dudjom Lingpa oeuvre that is more profound than what is contained in Longchenpa’s works.

This is a better argument.  But it runs into the same problem as my first hypothetical above. There is a translation out there that doesn’t even raise the issue of Chatral R’s wishes.  Now I’m not going to comment on the relative quality of the two translation, but I know people have opinions on that.

stoneinfocus said:
The text is the text. If your lama says you can read it, you can read it. I get that you're trying to respect every lama's wishes, but what your lama says first is what matters most. If you come across a situation like you describe and you want to ask them, that's fine, but there is no fault in reading a text you have permission for, regardless of some lama putting a restriction on it.

You can either follow the spirit of how transmission and permission works, or you can cling to rules. Personally, I'll not question when my lamas say I can read something. It's not a fault to read something they said I could read.

The fact is that Tibetans don’t respect these prohibitions and never have. Marpa for example.The only way to keep a text unread is to keep it in a manuscript.

The system of lungs exists solely due to scarcity of paper and the low level of literacy in Tibet.

The value of reading transmissions is in continuing a lineage of a text. That is a valid point. However, the absence of a lung for a text does not mean it does not get read. I can provide many examples of texts that have no lung and continue to be read widely, for example Nubchen’s Lamp.

Ethics are for suckers? We are definitely in Mappo.

Malcolm wrote:
He is referring to people who expect Vajrayāna gurus to conform to conventional Buddhist ethics. Such people, he writes, should stick with common Mahāyāna, because somehow, there is some magical substance in Vajrayāna samayas that make you fall into hell if you disapprove of your guru's conduct or resist their abuse, should they in fact be abusive in a real sense.

Somehow, in some people's minds, the ritual of empowerment creates a magical chain that turns one into a Buddhist serf if one should take empowerment. This idea is perfectly understandable in the context of Tibetan culture, as the Tibetans tend to view the relationship between teacher and student as something resembling a lord and a vassal. Of course in the real world, it does not necessarily play out like this at all. But generally people like to use the fantasy novel about Milarepa written in the 15th century, or the accounts of Naropa's trials under Tilopa as proof that we should allow our gurus to torture us for our own good, excusing the pathological behavior of Trungpa and others on such grounds.

In his writings DJKR devotes thousands of words to criticizing people who are offended when they are treated badly by some Vajrayāna teacher and wish to leave, basically asserting that feeling harmed by some person they participated in a ritual with means they will never achieve liberation, not even considering for one second that the real situation is that student and that teacher do not have the right karmic connection at all and it is better for them to separate. The real problem here is a catechistic and realist interpretation of samaya and a failure to appreciate that teachers can and do break samaya with their students. This point is never actually addressed in any comprehensive way by DJKR in any of his writings. In his writings, the onus is always placed on the student to behave, never the teacher.

As far as DJKR's politics go, well, he likes to stir things up and create controversy. But over the years a very distinct pattern of conservatism has emerged—there is nothing good at all about the West, and basically, I am quite sure that in his mind we should go back to the some time where there was an enlightened dharmarāja to run the world (which is a fantasy). I find in his writings a great deal of nostalgia. He seems to be akin to what Ann Applebaum, a conservative columnist for the Washington Post, describes as a nostalgic conservative:

Radically different from the reflective nostalgics are what Boym calls the restorative nostalgics, not all of whom recognize themselves as nostalgics at all. Restorative nostalgics don’t just look at old photographs and piece together family stories. They are mythmakers and architects, builders of monuments and founders of nationalist political projects. They do not merely want to contemplate or learn from the past. They want, as Boym puts it, to “rebuild the lost home and patch up the memory gaps.” Many of them don’t recognize their own fictions about the past for what they are: “They believe their project is about truth.” They are not interested in a nuanced past, in a world in which great leaders were flawed men, in which famous military victories had lethal side effects. They don’t acknowledge that the past might have had its drawbacks. They want the cartoon version of history, and more importantly, they want to live in it, right now. They don’t want to act out roles from the past because it amuses them: they want to behave as they think their ancestors did, without irony.

It is not by accident that restorative nostalgia often goes hand in hand with conspiracy theories and the medium-sized lies. These needn’t be as harsh or crazy as the Smolensk conspiracy theory or the Soros conspiracy theory; they can gently invoke scapegoats rather than a full-fledged alternative reality. At a minimum, they can offer an explanation: The nation is no longer great because someone has attacked us, undermined us, sapped our strength. Someone—the immigrants, the foreigners, the elites, or indeed the EU—has perverted the course of history and reduced the nation to a shadow of its former self. The essential identity that we once had has been taken away and replaced with something cheap and artificial. Eventually, those who seek power on the back of restorative nostalgia will begin to cultivate these conspiracy theories, or alternative histories, or alternative fibs, whether or not they have any basis in fact.

Applebaum, Anne. Twilight of Democracy (p. 74-75). Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group. Kindle Edition.

In DJKR's case, it seems he feels that it westerners and democracy itself are attacking, undermining, and sapping the strength of the Dharma. Take this post on Facebook:



In short, he really dislikes the West and liberal democracy. Not sure what he wants to replace it with...

Tibeans and Bhutanese do the same thing. It is no different.

Obedience to autocratic authority in the name of imaginary friends ("wisdom beings") whom one claims to speak for is not actually part of the dharma. But it is what passes for guru devotion in DJKR's writings.

Most people don't realize this, but "rājas" in Buddha's tribe were elected. It was not a hereditary position. The Buddha instituted a form of representative democracy based on seniority in the monastic sangha, which still exists today. For example, the head of the Geluk school is elected, not appointed.

Anyway, DJKR does enough good things for the Dharma that his unfortunate naivety in politics and lack of understanding of modern history is forgivable. I'd definitely never vote for him though. I'd never take teachings from him either (which I am sure he prefers). But that's just me. It's better he remains a vajra brother.

Lenz’s grift was “American Buddhism.” His scheme was to get naive people to come to concerts by his Kitaro influenced new age band, Zazen, and call that meditation. He wrote stupid, orientalist adventure novels that make T. Lobsang Rampa look credible by comparison, such memorable titles as Surfing in the Himalayas, featuring, I kid you not, a fellow named Master Fwap, etc. The more intelligent people he sent to school to learn computer science, set them up with Wall Street jobs, and tithed them 10%. In this way he became wealthy very quickly through his software company filled with devotees. But it all had nothing to do with Buddhadharma.

After Lenz’s suicide/accidental death (it’s not clear which), one of his main students married one of Namkhai Drime Rinpoche’s daughters. Her sister married Mukpo and became queen of Shambhala. You can guess the rest.

The advisory board for the Lenz Foundation is telling:

Liz Lewinson, Chairperson
B. A. Smith, Co-Chairperson
Dr. Koshin Paley Ellison, MFA, LMSW, DMin, co-founder, the New York Zen Center for Contemplative Care
Lisa Marshall, CEO, Rama Meditation Society

Really, whether this conference will be of any value is mostly dependent on the speakers, not the topic labels.

The thing is that even with modern physics (if we go that route) it’s hard to argue for the “real existence” (I.e. “outside”) of anything beyond just obstruction via…I don’t know, probability fields or something.

So, all *experience* is of the mind, and we can only ever know of “outside” existence via inference.

Malcolm wrote:
No object, no experience. This can be known through direct perception and not inference. If you argue that all experience is inferential, than awakening is impossible, since it is also reduced to an inference.

Johnny Dangerous said:
Not saying all experience is inferential, that wouldn't make sense at all. I'm saying things that are labelled "outside" experience - stuff like atoms etc. (not in the abidharma sense, in the modern sense) are only knowable through inferences made about subjective experiences.

Malcolm wrote:
Inference is a form of valid knowledge.

But we don’t need to infer that in absence of light our eyes can’t see outer objects, and when there is light they can see outer objects.

I’ve got a similar feeling about Uma Thurman, whom I have met and wasn’t totally blown away by her Bodhisattva qualities either.

Tilopa said:
Not intending to be critical but afaik she's just an ordinary person so expecting her to have the qualities of a bodhisattva may be a bit unrealistic.

Or am I missing something and she's been recognized as the incarnation of a Lama?

Either way maybe you just got her on a bad day.

KristenM said:
For sure. It is an unrealistic expectation to assume a child of a great Buddhist practitioner would have those same qualities.

Malcolm wrote:
Who says Thurman is a “great Buddhist practitioner?” I met him, and while he can be funny, I found him to be rather hysterical and brittle in general.

Malcolm wrote:
DJKR’s politics are not interesting or particularly well-informed. His grasp of modern history is atrocious.

Nevertheless, he has used his reputation to benefit many people with the dharma, despite what ever one perceive his personal limitations to be.

I generally make a point of separating people’s politics from their commitment to Dharma.

Not really. The rig pa'i rtsal dbang is deeper than the fourth empowerment. Of course attending a Hevajra empowerment is not negative, but it is not related to Dzogchen teachings directly.

I think that that "really" is doing a lot of work in that sentence. I think that it's dragging a lot of unsaid material behind it.

Malcolm wrote:
The point is that motivation is the underlying determining factor for whether a bodhisattva has broken their vows, not the action itself.

There is a vast literature in Tibetan Buddhism on the three vows. I personally agree with Sakya Pandita's point of view, where the higher vow contradicts the lower vow, one follows the higher vow.

For example, he points out that bodhisattva bhikṣus can handle gold and silver, own property, engage in trade, etc. This is prohibited for śrāvaka bhikṣus. Likewise, Vajrayāna bhikṣus can eat meat, drink alcohol, which is prohibited for Mahāyāna bhkṣus.

As I said, anything for the cause.

The usual example is the bodhisattva bhikṣu who had sex with a young women who threatened to kill herself if he did not make love to her. His prātimoḳsa defeat is not considered a defeat in the bodhisattvasamvara.

Would he still be disrobed?

Externally, I am sure. Internally, he never broke his prātimokṣa. The case of Virupa is a little similar, though the context is different.

The logic of this is that it allows other people to rejoice in the merit of the donor. Definitely cringy from a western POV, but I have also seen this in large Tibetan teachings as well, such as Lamdre, etc., as well, where the sponsors of tea offerings have their names read off before the tea offering begins.
