We can agree that once an animal has been killed for its meat the harm has been done. As you have said, meat itself does not suffer. What you consistently overlook is how the acceptance of this meat, especially if it is paid for, completes the cycle of supply and demand. By rewarding the killing for meat, the consumer is encouraging subsequent killing.

Malcolm wrote:
And I have also demonstrated that meat is consistently supplied to the market in excess of demand. Our commodity markets are driven on futures, expectations of demand, not real demand.

This is not like Tibet, where, for example, Shabkar could reasonably scold monasteries for ordering sheep to be slaughtered based on demand for meat in monasteries.

The number of slaughtered animals in the chain far exceeds the actual demand for meat. Additionally, as I also pointed out, money we pay to markets which sell meat is not divvied up from moneys from vegetables. The only way to avoid supporting that market's purchasing of meat in general is to stop shopping at omnivore markets.

I am certain that in the near future, there will be a trend toward vegan and vegetarian markets — but that does not exist now, at least nowhere near where I live.

There used to be millions of buffalo on the Great Plains — according to current ideology, this should have contributed greatly to global warming, but the opposite in fact is true. Native Americans herded buffalo for 10,000 years and built one of the largest carbon sinks ever in human history.

If it makes you happy to insist on adding lhun grub, ok, but it isn't necessary. The Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra states:
The basis is called “great original purity” which is present as the essence, nature and compassion. The pristine consciousness of the unchanging essence manifests without impediment and is called “the reality of the youthful vase body.” The nature is the unimpeded five lights. For example, the appearance of compassion is like the absence of clouds. That is called “the reality of original purity,” i.e. unlimited and not falling into any position
And:
One will be liberated on the ultimate stage of original purity.
And:
Next, the absence of anything higher than the pristine consciousness
that naturally arises on the stage of original purity is the
attainment of the sixteen stage, Highest Wisdom.
And the String of Pearls Tantra states:
Everything actualizes buddhahood in the state
of original purity free from taints.
The Realms and Transformations of Sound Tantra states:
Further, when the mind is ripened,
the basis is present in the dharmakāya,
the taints upon original purity are exhausted
and the essence has never been deluded.
Vimalamitra states:
The basis, the state of initial original purity, is liberated
because its essence is not established at all.
Its nature appears as everything
and its compassion arises in every way.
It is pretty clear to me that the intention of the 17 Tantras is that the basis is ka dag, original purity.

Pearl Necklace tantra states:

The Six Dimensions of Samantabhadra states:

Among all of these stages of intellect,
the essence is pure from the beginning.
Vimalamitra comments on this passage:
When the asserted positions about the seven bases that are the object of knowledge are divided into two, there are six defective positions concerning the basis and the faultless position of original purity which is confirmed in our own texts...A follower of philosophical tenets asserts that all objects of knowledge are confirmed from the seven positions because assertions about the basis are confirmed through proofs, refutations, contradictions and replies. Those other six defective philosophical tenets are clearly explained in the Six Dimensions and so on. However, those who follow philosophical tenets [15a] resemble someone who has not seen Vajrāsana telling stories about Vajrāsana. Simply put, they do not confirm the profound meaning that is to be understood.
So however you want to slice it up, of the seven positions about the basis, only the position that the basis is originally pure is non-defective.


alpha said:
One the other hand what good does it do to make kadag the focus of one's view and place lhun grub on a lesser position as potentially being the cause of error.
To me focusing on kadag alone as being the definitive view can lead to errors as well.

Malcolm wrote:
Addressing your concern, he continues:
Since the six assertions about the basis are recognized as the potential of original purity, the practice of the faultless philosophical tenet is like explaining Vajrāsana having been there. That is without error. In addition, it is so because the explanatory description is faultless. People who follow philosophical tenets can only partially explain how the six assertions about the basis are defective.
In other words, it is recognized that the other six positions about the basis, while faulty, do indeed address an aspect of the potentiality of original purity. Nevertheless, only describing the basis as original purity is considered absolutely faultless from the point of view of the system of Dzogchen laid out in the 17 Tantras.

Maybe the problem here is that your understanding of original purity is too confined to the emptiness aspect. Original purity has essence, nature and compassion. It has the three kāyas. Why? Because it is dharmakāya. There is no dharmakāya without the other two.

Aye, that does seem to be the rub.

I understand that Tantra is also distinct from Dzogchen. Can you elaborate on that distinction?

Malcolm wrote:
Sūtra in general belongs to the path of renunciation — this is the main method of practice.

Tantra in general belongs to the path of transformation — using the creation stage and completion stage and so on, generating oneself as the deity, reciting mantras, transforming one's impure dimension into a pure one.

Dzogchen is path of liberation or self-liberation, where one does not need to apply any sort of antidote, either in terms of renunciation or transformation. Instead phenomena are allowed to self-liberate just a they are by recognizing one's primordial state and integrating with that. Apart from Norbu Rinpoche's teachings, the place where these three paths are most clearly explained is in the Zhang Zhung sNyan rgyud teachings belonging to the Bon school, especially the outer cycle:
Now then, the first, the path of renunciation, gives up the ten nonvirtues and accomplishes the ten virtues. The result is asserted to be buddhahood after many lives and eons. That is the path of causal characteristics. 

Second, the so called “path of transformation” of result secret mantra is transforming the outer universe into a celestial mansion, transforming the inhabitants into gods and goddesses, transforming the five samsaya substances into the five ambrosias, transforming the five aggregates into the five deities and transforming the five afflictions into the five wisdoms. This is asserted as buddhahood, being the path of result secret mantra. 

However, neither the path of renunciation nor the past of transformation will be explained here. What it to be explained here now is the inseparability of cause and result in the great vehicle. 

In the explanation of the so called “path of great self liberation with nothing to accept or reject” samsara and nirvana, existence and nonexistence, the duality of permanence and annihilation, the duality of happiness and suffering, the duality of attachment and aversion, the five afflictions, the eight consciousnesses, all appearances of deluded concepts of subject and object are not abandoned and are not to be abandoned. Since everything arises from the mind, in the sole unique sphere, abandonment and accepting do not exist as a duality. Therefore, everything that arises self-arises, everything that is liberated is self-liberated, therefore it is termed “the path of liberation.”

It has lhun grub, but lhun grub is the cause of making mistakes, whereas, ka dag can never be the cause of error. This is why 17 Tantras state that the basis is ka dag, and that this is the correct position. Sometimes, the union of ka dag and lhun grub is called " ka dag chen po " — still, ka dag is more important because it can never be a basis for delusion, unlike lhun grub.

To me those quotes you gave are only arguments to support the originally pure nature of the basis .Because this purity is not just purity it has a potentiality and a luminosity, aspects which are actually reffered in your quotes essence, nature and compassion

They are taken directly from the book, Buddhahood in This Life [to be published by Wisdom next year], where the author, Vimalamitra, runs through the seven positions of the basis, and identifies the position of the basis as ka dag as the only faultless one. This is a summary of an extensive section in the commentary of the Kun bzang klong drug tantra. Vimalamitra does not go into it further because, as he says, it is mostly an intellectual discussion, not for practitioners.

Ka dag does not mean only emptiness, though sometimes people misunderstand it that way Ka dag refers to the fact that reality has always been pure, never affected by ignorance and so on. This is why it is the basis, and not lhun grub.

We make a distinction between the Primordial Buddha, which is the True Aspect of each being's Mind, and the Buddhas with 32 Major and 80 Minor characteristics who appear in response to the needs of deluded beings. The way we put it, we each embody all sentient as well as insentient beings such as plants, trees, rocks down to atoms and up to the entire dharmadhatu environment in a way that mind and body, self and environment, and person and reality are "two but not two". Our starting point is the Primordial Buddha's revelation of his body, which we do not presently understand completely, and then progression through investigation to full realization. Provisional Buddha (the Buddha that appears as Buddha) is the awakening function of our Mind.

Because there is no arising and perishing, there is no self and other. Because there is no death and transmigration, there is no permanence and annihilation. 
Therefore, there is no delusion or samsara. In fact, there is also no nirvana.

Industrial meat cultivation is certainly bad for the environment.

But we humans put our welfare above that of other creatures, including other humans, all the time. It is the norm, not the exception.

For example, we decide we need to irrigate a field —— we give absolutely no thought to the millions, possibly billions of creatures we are drowning. But vegetarians consider rice "less harmful."

The idea that being a vegetarian is less harmful than choosing to consume consciously raised, grass fed beef and pastured pork and chicken is ludicrous.

The fact is that everything we do harms some one or something. We have our vanity of course, but in the end, everyone chooses to ignore the harm they do to some creature either directly or indirectly. At least I don't pretend. I choose my diet based on what is good for the planet as a whole, understanding that all my choices involve harming some creature or another.

By all means spare a thought for the suffering of beings as small as a dust mite, but it seems to me completely impractical to avoid actions that may unintentionally harm them. Such actions of course include washing you own body and clothes. There is inevitably a kind of background noise of suffering we cause that we simply cannot avoid. Presented with this fact (and equating the suffering of microorganisms with that of more highly developed animals), some will rationalize that practicing harmlessness it futile, and disregard the tangible suffering inflicted on the animals that they choose to exploit. Worse still are the crude justifications made for overlooking this suffering. When these justifications are made in the name of the Buddhadharma, the truly compassionate must speak out.

Malcolm wrote:
When you know they are there, you are not "unintentionally" harming them, you are ignoring them.

For example, just as when one drives a car in the spring and summer, thousands of insects wind up smashed in the grill of our cars. We may regret all the thousands of insect lives we take, but we certainly do nothing about them. We keep driving anyway, since our human business is so much more important than theirs, and we are more "highly developed" sentient beings.

The thing is, there no qualitative difference between one creature and another, there is only quantitative difference in terms of sense organ development. This is why we can be reborn as bugs, and they can be reborn as humans.

Ignoring the suffering we cause creatures who live in the ground when we plough fields and calling it "unintentional" when we know full well we are inflicting all kinds of harm on all kinds of creatures, that is a justification. At least I understand that all the food that I eat comes with a price of suffering. I don't pretend that some suffering is excusable and some suffering is not — I certainly do not make a distinction between the suffering of one creature and that of another. I understand that my movement in the world is inevitably harmful whether I intend it or not, and knowing that means that I cannot really claim that I am "unintentionally" harming beings. All I can say is that I did not see a being, and develop the motive to kill it and proceed with that motivation ̦‚ and from the point of view of the Buddha, I am therefore free of the karma of killing. But that also applies to all the meat that I eat.

Arguing that not spending money on meat = saving animals is ludicrous at best.

Actually if you look at the stats: 38 percent of grain products are discarded at point of sale; 50 percent of seafood is discarded at point of sale; 52 percent of fruits and vegetables are discarded at point of sale; 22 percent of meats are discarded at point of sale and 20 percent of dairy are discarded at point of sale. This comes from an estimate made of supermarkets in USA, Canada, Australia and NZ.

What the figures above show is that for every ten pounds of meat we find in the markets, 22 percent of it goes to waste. This means that meat is not being sold into markets based on some precise metric of demand. You may choose not to eat meat, but you are not saving any beings at all by doing so. The supply of meat clearly outpaces demand. The supply of grain, seafood and fruit and vegetables is clearly outpacing demand.

So, especially with regards to fish, your abstaining from eating animals is saving none of the them. Of half the fish in the sea that have vanished in the past 50 years, half of those went to waste, not counting all the other creatures pulled up by nets.

And your being a vegetarian did not help any of them.

Clearly, "mind" is a pretty useless word, almost as bad as "soul" or "consciousness", unless one states from the outset what one means by it.

It also obscures the fact that what the English word refers to is a process and not a thing.

Bacon, ham and sausages rank alongside cigarettes as a major cause of cancer, the World Health Organisation has said, placing cured and processed meats in the same category as asbestos, alcohol, arsenic and tobacco.

The report from the WHO’s cancer arm, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, says there is enough evidence to rank processed meats as group 1 carcinogens, because of a causal link with bowel cancer.

It places red meat in group 2A, as “probably carcinogenic to humans”. Eating red meat is also linked to pancreatic and prostate cancer, the IARC says.

Although U.S. corn is a highly productive crop, with typical yields between 140 and 160 bushels per acre, the resulting delivery of food by the corn system is far lower. Today’s corn crop is mainly used for biofuels (roughly 40 percent of U.S. corn is used for ethanol) and as animal feed (roughly 36 percent of U.S. corn, plus distillers grains left over from ethanol production, is fed to cattle, pigs and chickens). Much of the rest is exported.  Only a tiny fraction of the national corn crop is directly used for food for Americans, much of that for high-fructose corn syrup.

This means that the very act of driving vehicles in the US, where there is ethanol in virtually everything involves deaths for just as many creatures as feed for cows.

I've looked at your link to your own quote. It is not clear what you are saying. Are you saying that the Bhavya that is being paraphrased is a Tibetan Bhavya from a period after the 8th century, as opposed to the famous Bhavaviveka also called Bhavya from the 6th century?

You say above " I already have shown elsewhere that this is a very inaccurate paraphrase of what Bhavaviveka says" and then in the link you say "It is not a text by Bhavaviveka. Bhavya is a much later master, post Shantarakshita." So is it a paraphrase of Bhavaviveka or isn't it?

Malcolm wrote:
It is a paraphrase of Bhavya, aka Bhavaviveka II

Adamantine said:
And if it is, and you are saying he is later than Śāntarakṣita, how is it that all biographies of Bhavaviveka date him 6th century, while Śāntarakṣita is clearly 8th century?  And while it may be clear to yourself, you have not done a good job of communicating what you think Dudjom Rinpoche's, or Bhavya's, or the Derge canonical edn. of the text: dbu-ma, Vol. Tsha's error is. So, what is it, and who made the original error?

Malcolm wrote:
There are two people referred to by one name. The author of the Madhyamakavrtti is the first, Bhavaviveka I; the author of the text, Tarkajvala, being paraphrased by Dudjom Rinpoche and other gzhan stong pas, is Bhavaviveka II.

While there is no mention of Prasanga or Svatantra in the Tarkajvala, it does mentions a great Madhyamaka. However, that "great Madhyamaka" is defined by how it treats relative truth, i.e. mind only. Coarse outer Madhyamaka treats relative truth in the manner of the Sarvastivadins and so on.

In general, Dudjom Rinpoche repeats an error universally common in Tibetan Buddhism scholastics, and it is by no means confined to him. That is, he cites a version of citation that has been passed down to him in an altered or truncated form without checking the original text to see if it is accurate. This is a big problem with Tibetan treatises in general, not confined to any one school or any one author.

The idea that any diet is less harmful than another, unless you are begging for alms, is the underlying point. Apart from killing animals yourself which is definitely harmful, all diets are equally harmful because they involve someone harming some creature at some time in the production of food.

And because it causes anxiety in beings, Mahamati, a practicing bodhisattva wishing friendliness of beings should not eat any meat at all."

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, of course there are Mahāyāna sūtras where the Buddha recommends vegetarianism. It is also equally true that Bhavaviveka addresses these issues in his famed Tarkajvala:
If one eats meat after creating suffering for the bodies of creatures, this will possess a fault, but if there is no mind in the creature when the meat is eaten, where can there be a misdeed if no suffering arises? Just as when one uses mother pearl, or the excrescences of fish and elephants, or peacock feathers, yak tails, teeth, bones, skin and so on, there is little or no suffering for the creature, just as when one uses fruit, water and so on there is no harm at all, in the same way, since there is no harm when meat is eaten, there is no fault. If there is a fault, then cremating the dead will be a misdeed.
Even in Mahāyāna, the Buddha never forbids using wool, using feathers, using leather, bone, shell, and many other kinds of animal products. It is inconsistent to claim that the passages where Buddha enjoins us not to eat meat must be taken as definitive teachings.

Bhavaviveka, whose Mahāyāna credentials are impeccable, certain opines that it is not necessary to take these passages literally. He points out that if the suffering of creatures is the problem we want to solve then we must avoid eating rice, sesame oil, and all kinds of other products which involve suffering for creatures.

Instead, we need to understand that this advice is aimed at people who kill animals or have them killed in order to eat them and that is all.

In reality, there is no difference between the body of a buddha and the body of a sentient being: they are equally unreal.

While we all possess the Buddhadhātu as our true Self, not all of us manifest as form body Buddhas. If you are a form body Buddha, you will not eat. The logic of this is obvious in the Angulimaliya Sutra:

Mañjuśrī, if any man or woman should think to themselves that they can do evil deeds because they will still be liberated by the existence within themselves of the Tathāgata-garbha, and then do some evil deed, how could their ātma-dhātu [Self- Factor] become liberated? As I previously explained, they will not be liberated, even though they do have the dhātu, just as in the case of the youth who engaged in asceticism. Why is that? Because they are very careless. Because they are careless, they will naturally not be liberated.

Shakyamuni was basically a holographic projection, existing only in the consciousnesses of sentient beings. How could a hologram need food? We're told in the Sarvabuddhaviṣayāvatārajñānālokālaṃkāra Sūtra:

“Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata is in the realm of non-arising. On the other hand, he appears in the world as a reflected image. According to the beliefs of sentient beings he displays diverse appearances and diverse lifespans. He appears among sentient beings who have become fitting receptacles for awakening thanks to their maturation and belief. These sentient beings then hear the Dharma according to their dispositions and beliefs. According to their dispositions they understand the three vehicles, and according to their dispositions they obtain belief."

And

“Mañjuśrī, there is no Tathāgata. However, the designation ‘Tathāgata’ comes about in the world because of the voice of Dharma. It is exclusively due to the maturation of sentient beings’ previous wholesome karma that they perceive the voice of the Tathāgata. That voice emerges in order to produce happiness for all sentient beings and to prompt those who are careless. Mañjuśrī, as those sentient beings hear that sound, they form the concept of a tathāgata, thinking, ‘This is the Tathāgata’s body.’"

If the Tathāgata never ate food, neither did we. Therefore, your obsession with diet is a complete waste of time.

Some phenomena, such as my dog, my wife, my kids, house and car, do seem to exist apart from my small mind. Merely by my thoughts, I do not seem able to make my wife go away (not that I would ever want to!). When I leave "my house" on a trip, there "my wife" is (and "my house") when I return.

Hello,

The following is just one practitioner's opinion from a small corner-non-corner of Buddhism.

It may be that the negative spirits are just the heart-mind. When the heart and mind are at peace, the negative spirits disappear with the breeze. They never were real from the start except for the mind's own making them real.

So, just sit, dropping all thought of spirits and their negativity and ... poof ... a certain Positive Peace may be found instead.

Better, however, to ask your own Teacher in your own Tradition.

Forgotten was Bill Clinton's selection of Goldman Sachs honcho Robert Rubin to be his treasury secretary, an appointee who with President Clinton's complicity presided over the dismantling of New Deal limits on financial greed.

These are Chinese martial arts and the Chinese adherents claim this as their tradition. Lama Pai, Tibetan White Crane (not to be confused with Fujian Style White Crane), Lama or Tibetan Kungfu, and Hop Gar, according to tradition, originated in far Western China in the border regions with Tibet and then moved to north China and then down south. An American student of Tibetan White Crane published his research which which indicates a Northern China origin, contrary to received tradition.

BTW, internal and external martial arts adherents also claim the "Indian" (probably Central Asian in origin although as far south as Sri Lanka have been claimed) Bodhidharma as their founder. Is any of this historically true? Possibly, but it would seem more likely that various schools of physical practice borrowed from each other, eventually merged, and then people invented a unified historical origin. It does seem likely that some yoga exercises made their way to China and influenced physical practice there. It is a fascinating topic in intellectual history and diffusion.

I do not think there is a transfer of energy from guru to disciple because during a real direct introduction there isnt any guru that gives or transfers something to the disciple .But some of us take part in a direct introduction with the expectation that we might get something which we dont already have.

Malcolm wrote:
The term direct introduction is a bit misleading. The term is translated from the tibetan, which is rang ngo thog tu phrad, "directly encounter your own state." This direct introduction or encounter is facilitated by a Guru, but as you correctly note, nothing is transferred per se, because the guru is merely showing you your own face [ rang ngo ] or your own state [ rang ngo ] in a direct encounter [ thog tu phrad ]. This is done on the basis of experiences, as the example of Nyoshul Lungtog's encounter with Patrul Rinpoche:
Nyoshul Lungtok, who later became one of the greatest Dzogchen masters of recent times, followed his teacher Patrul Rinpoche for about eighteen years. During all that time, they were almost inseparable. Nyoshul Lungtok studied and practiced extremely diligently, and accumulated a wealth of purification, merit, and practice; he was ready to recognize the Rigpa, but had not yet had the final introduction. Then, one famous evening, Patrul Rinpoche gave him the introduction. It happened when they were staying together in one of the hermitages high up in the mountains above Dzogchen Monastery. It was a very beautiful night. The dark blue sky was clear and the stars shone brilliantly. The sound of their solitude was heightened by the distant barking of a dog from the monastery below. Patrul Rinpoche was lying stretched out on the ground, doing a special Dzogchen practice. He called Nyoshul Lungtok over to him, saying: "Did you say you do not know the essence of the mind?" Nyoshul Lungtok guessed from his tone that this was a special moment and nodded expectantly.

"There's nothing to it really," Patrul Rinpoche said casually, and added, "My son, come and lie down over here: be like your old father." Nyoshul Lungtok stretched out by his side.

Then Patrul Rinpoche asked him, "Do you see the stars up there in the sky?"
"Yes."

"Do you hear the dogs barking in Dzogchen Monastery?"
"Yes."

"Do you hear what I'm saying to you?"
"Yes."

"Well, the nature of Dzogchen is this: simply this."

Nyoshul Lungtok tells us what happened then: "At that instant, I arrived at a certainty of realization from within. I had been liberated from the fetters of 'it is' and 'it is not.' I had realized the primordial wisdom, the naked union of emptiness and intrinsic awareness. I was introduced to this realization by his blessing, as the great Indian master Saraha said: He in whose heart the words of the master have entered, Sees the truth like a treasure in his own palm."
The sad part is that someone will take this literally, think that they should go somewhere, lie on the ground, listen to dogs bark and think this is direct introduction.

As you know, direct introduction is not introducing you to something you don't have. It is introducing you to something you have always had, and misplaced. This is one reason why the Buddhanature metaphor useful in Dzogchen, but here it means something a bit different than in lower yanas [cue, Son of the Buddha].

In the lineages I have had the good fortune to be part of, this is often not taken as a formal ritual at all, and the actual transmission on this level happens in a different way, in the context of very close teacher-student relationship, one to one, over the course of time. And it is never formal. Although it is a direct introduction it bears no resemblance at all to the DI as given within the Dzogchen Community. It is in fact so different in look, and feel, as if it is a completely different thing. This is why many older Tibetan lamas have such a problem with what Norbu Rinpoche is doing. I myself do not.

Malcolm wrote:
Whoever said direct introduction needs to be a formal ritual? That depends on context. Certainly, the direct introduction that ChNN received from Rigdzin Chanchub Dorje was not a ritual.

Then one should encourage people to find a qualified teacher and not encourage people to believe they have understand what they have not understood because that understanding depends on the intimate instructions of the guru, and not books.

At least with some of the translations out there, the batteries are quite fine, and the flashlight is reasonably bright.

So, the Direct Introductions were received through means of a book. There is one question I had about Guru Padmasambhava's "Self-Liberation." I had quoted the Guru where he said four times that the text was a "direct introduction to your intrinsic awareness," but the quotations were rejected as false.

Malcolm wrote:
Steve, what was rejected was your conclusion about what the quotes mean. The text you cited was an oral text written down by someone. They are Guru Padmasabhava's speech, not a book written out by an author. When a guru presents that text, he does so because he has received the lung for that text and knows how to present it. For you, that Guru is the same as Guru Padmasambhava.

steve_bakr said:
The question I wanted to ask was, "Are we to believe Guru Padmasambhava or not?" "Did he tell the truth or not?" If Guru Padmasambhava reiterates that same point four times, is it even permissible to say that he is wrong all four times? Isn't he a venerated source?

Malcolm wrote:
Steve, no one is saying that what Guru Rinpoche said is wrong. Your understanding is wrong.

When he was teaching, he was giving direct introduction through words to a group of students. Which students? Principally a translator named Chogro Lui Gyaltsen, who is renowned as one of the translators of the 17 Tantras. Also Yeshe Tsogyal, she was the direct heir to these teachings. Karma Lingpa was the reincarnation of Chogro and the one appointed to promulgate them. So what you are reading is a record of one of Guru Padmasambhava's teaching sessions. Guru Rinpoche in fact wrote very little, but he taught a lot and those recorded teachings are what we now have as the treasure tradition. But they are all just so many books without proper empowerment, reading transmission and instruction

After Karma Lingpa revealed the text, he gave the empowerments, the lung and the teachings to his sun, Nyida Chojey, who then spread it widely. Ever since then it is a teaching that has been passed down in connection with the empowerment of the peaceful and wratful deities in his tradition. I have this transmission as do many people you are talking to. You can easily get this transmission, it is given rather frequently, and I am sure if you ask someone to teach you the text, respectfully and with a beginners attitude, you will have no problem.

The main reason Reynolds translated it again was to correct Evans Wentz's and Jung's misunderstandings of the text.

Adamantine said:
I agree with this, as I said before: pointing out instructions are not necessarily given with a label, or warning. Fourth empowerments and rikpa tsel wangs still have a bit of that expectation. There is another approach, which is quite spontaneous, and the disciple will only know it was a pointing out if they "get it". I believe true Dzogchen masters are giving a type of pointing out all of the time, in infinite ways, and if one has the opportunity to spend significant time with one, they should jump at it.

Ivo said:
Very true. One of my closest teachers once told me that his own teacher (a pivotal figure in the recent history of the Nyingma) never gave them this type of direct introduction at all, and only gave them lungs for the various direct introduction traditional texts in order for them to find the experience by themselves. He also never gave commentaries on any Dzogchen texts to his heart disciples, even on the seven treasures and YL, only lungs. And he was the master of masters.

Malcolm wrote:
Ivo, as you very well know, the extremely unelaborate empowerment of the four Nyinthig empowerments is precisely a direct introduction. So what are you talking about?

Of course you have to discover Dzogchen knowledge through your own experience, and of course, having been ripened with the rig pa'i rtsal dbang through whichever of the three ways it can be given — pandita style, secret mantra style or pointing out for old ladies —  then of course one takes whatever practice texts one needs and goes and does Dzogchen practices such as rushen, etc. and eliminates one's doubts. But the effectiveness of Dzogchen practice comes about through one's interaction with a teacher and practices they give one, not from reading books and developing nice fantasies about what Dzogchen might be based on reading Western translations without a proper teacher.

People who only read English translations of these texts without access to a Tibetan teacher who can clarify for them what this and that actually means are like blind people in a cave who have been given flashlight with dead batteries to find their way out.

Malcolm wrote:
I have been patiently explaining for many days now, ever since steve showed up. Not only myself, but many other people.

Anyone who has been a student of Norbu Rinpoche for any length of time knows that you really should receive the transmission for any Dzgchen text you wish to study. Dzogchen texts are not meant to be read in absence of proper instruction. Yes, of course, when you know the meaning, then one Dzogchen text is just as good as another, they all have the same meaning more or less, depending on whether we are talking about sems sde, klong sde, or man ngag sde. Still, if you want to really work with a text, then the proper way to do it is to find someone who will teach you the text in a proper way. This was how it was done in Tibet, we are no different today. If you can't find someone to teach you that text, then you find someone who will teach you any text of Dzogchen. The text does not matter, what matters is whether the master has genuine realization of the teachings of Dzogchen.

With this post I am actually quoting a recognized authority, so the disclaimer in my signature does not apply.

Starting around the 15 minute mark in the following link
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGzN4FAFgTs
Alan Wallace talks about the various approaches to Dzogchen. At one end of the spectrum is getting the "pointing out instructions" (D.I. by a different name) in a weekend retreat without any other preparations approach. He affirms that this is a valid approach, what we would call "top down". At the other end of the spectrum is spending 20 years studying the texts and then going off and doing long retreats. He said his teacher didn't teach him either of those two ways but was a third way, just practice based. Plus obviously there is the "bottom up" approach with progressing through the lower 8 yanas.

Around the 17 minute mark he talks about what the pointing out instructions are like. At first he calls them "mind to mind transmission" but then he says it isn't literal. He does say it is "...a resonance, an affinity, a transmission..." where metaphorically the clouds can part for a moment or a minute. It's at the 20 minute mark he says in 24 years his teacher Gyaltrul R. never gave him pointing out instructions.

There is more than one way approach the subject. Our tendency to dismiss or exclude the entire spectrum of approaches here at DW tends to make the discussions somewhat myopic.

Garudavista said:
I believe Alan Wallace may not have needed pointing out instructions because he was practicing Mahamudra and not Dzogchen. Although the base for both is the same, the methods are quite different. I think that is what you've stated in your post. However, to avoid any potential confusion, I just wanted to clarify that he didn't need pointing out instructions because he was practicing Mahamudra and not Dzogchen. If I am wrong about this, please feel free to correct me.

You cannot have it both ways, Ivo. You cannot on the one hand claim that you never said that direction introduction can be gained from a book, and on the other hand claim that it can.

In the hands of a master, any number of texts, hundreds, if not thousands of them are effective means for giving direct introduction — but in reality, a master does not need a book to give direct introduction.

And... while I am still in my recreational break, which went far too long today, I may as well state, in full compliance with the DW tradition to put words into our teachers' mouths, that during all the years I have spent trying to find my way in Dzogchen with the help of a number of teachers, I have never met a teacher who would state that a person can not have an authentic rikpa experience by oneself, be it reading books or whatever. Even a total beginner, in fact, it is easier for them. So I can safely say for myself that I know of no Dzogchen teacher who would state that as a fact, including ChNN if asked one to one. This doesn't mean that my teachers would present this as a path or valid option for beginners, or talk about this on public talks, but denying that it might happen is absurd. In my opinion it shows a total lack of understanding of what Dharma is and what the samsaric condition actually is.

Rig pa, Ivo, is knowledge, as opposed to ma rig pa, ignorance.

You seem to be claiming that ordinary people can have knowledge of their primordial state spontaneously. If this were true, there would never have been any need at all for teachers and teachings.

I have never met one single authentic teacher of Dzogchen who would claim that one could have this experiential knowledge [rig pa] without it having first been introduced to one by a master.

People can experience the nature of the mind [George] without introduction, just as they can see George on a train everyday without knowing [ma rig pa] who George is. When people are introduced to the knowledge of the nature of the their minds, then we can say they have "rig pa".

Rig pa and the nature of the mind aka primordial state aka basis, are not the same thing. The fact that people continually conflate these two is unfortunate. But if you pay attention to ChNN, he says repeatedly, "rig pa is not the nature of the mind, rig pa is knowledge or instant presence in the nature of the mind."

Malcolm wrote:
Our friend steve is making a different suggestion. He is making the suggestion that you do not need a master whatsoever, and that reading a text like Self-Liberation without a master is sufficient for introduction. In other words, he is suggesting that merely by reading a book, one can understand the taste of sugar.

Not only do I disagree, but ChNN would think such a suggestion preposterous.

I think the George thing can be right under the surface for some individuals, for others, it may take longer, and I've had Nirmanakayas in the form of teachers come up and introduce themselves "I'm George" which implies they care very much, more than most of us here can know, for me the outer "George" was the same as the inner "George"... and it's still that way, so there isn't a line of separation, what's outside is what is inside and what's inside is what is outside, so if your outside looks a certain way, thats YOU and nobody else, you created it, including whether you see a Nirmanakaya inside or outside or both at the same time.  Everybody is different, some can understand immediately, some take more time, and some take ages, but people shouldn't be lumped into "he or she is just a beginner" when it comes to Dzogchen as CHNN has said again and again while giving teachings.

Malcolm wrote:
You have not understood the point. The point is that George is not under the surface at all, he is sitting right next to you, in full view. But still sentient beings do not recognize George unless he is introduced. And they will never recognize George by reading a book, no matter how wonderful, in exactly the same way they will never be able to understand the taste of sugar by reading about it in a book, no matter how precise.

But not with this... We are discussing the terma tradition here. It is not just a book, not even for a complete beginner.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, it is just a book, even for an advanced yogi. There is nothing special about a terma text that makes it superior to say a sūtra or a tantra in terms of blessings. This is just superstition. Of course there are some texts that can plant a positive connection in a person's mind so they can make a connection with the lineage at a future time. Even so, texts are always something relative and something quite limited.

Termas are also part of the oral tradition. They are held to have been orally taught by Padmasambhava [or someone else, like Saraha] to a specific person at a specific time and place, and when they are unpacked by the predicted terton, he again gives the oral transmission as he received it, thus continuing it without a break. Also tertons, by definition, must be realized Dzogchen masters.

Mahāyāna Sutras are actually termas. So are all Tantras.

Malcolm wrote:
Ivo — rig pa is the knowledge of a very specific thing, one's primordial state. This is very, very subtle and cannot be accessed through a coarse mind that is engaged in reading a book, not matter how nice those words are.

We are talking about a beginner, someone who has never met George. They might see George every day on the subway, but they will never know who George is. However, when they are at last introduced to George by someone who knows George, they will say, "Oh, I see you everyday on the Subway." After that point, they will always recognize George, even if he changes his suit, hat, shoes, etc. But without that introduction, they will never recognize George, and George, being rather disinterested in people, will never walk up and introduce himself, saying, "I am George."

you can say that there is enlightenment in a provisional sense, but in an absolute sense enlightenment is dualistic because it is paired in contrast to its opposite.

Malcolm wrote:
This argument is explicitly rejected in the Rig pa rang shar.

steve_bakr said:
Therefore, I can understand your saying that the absolute viewpoint contradicts Dzogchen Tantras. .

Malcolm wrote:
What I am saying is that your argument is explicitly rejected in the Tantras of Dzogchen. The Rig pa Rang shar gives the following account. Follow it closely and you can see that your point of view is explicitly negated. The context of the argument, btw, is to prove that Buddhahood is attained merely through an introduction.
[Opponent]
The opponents reply to that:
all phenomena are nondual.
Therefore, there cannot be duality.
Since there are no sentient beings, there are no buddhas.
Therefore, [nonduality] is freedom from the extremes of dualistic appearances.

[Reply]
Now then, is this stated in the ultimate sense,
or stated for the objects of deluded appearances?
Our reply to that and the demonstration of the proofs:
that this is so in in the ultimate sense,
but there is a dualistic appearance in the objects of deluded appearances.

[Opponent]
The  opponents rebuttal to that:
because there is no duality in the ultimate sense, 
it is not reasonable for there to be duality in objects of deluded appearances. 
Why? Because there is no duality in the ultimate sense. 
In that case it is reasonable that all sentient beings
could be liberated without the need for effort. 
Why? Because duality does not exist in the basis. 

[Reply]
Now then, how is duality asserted? 
The reply to that is:
when there are no buddhas and no sentient beings, 
there is no second or third in the basis. 
Because the potentiality of play arises from that [basis], 
buddhas and sentient beings arise as a duality.

[Opponent]
Now it is asserted that duality exists in the basis.
Because there is no good or bad in the basis,
for what reason is it said to exist as a duality? 
In that case, there cannot be transformation. 
Why? It is reasonable that sentient beings do not attain buddhahood. 
For example, even though coal
is polished, it will never become white. 
In the same way, deluded sentient beings
will never become buddhas through practicing meditation. 

[Reply]
Next, the reply is given like this:
because it exists to be demonstrated, 
the result is attained through the demonstration.
If not demonstrated, how can there be liberation? 

There are no signs in the dharmas of the basis, 
no grasping to the dharmas of the path,
and no attainment of the dharmatā of the result. 
The basis of sentient beings and the basis of buddhahood
is definitely differentiated by a sole difference.
 For what reason is there a sole difference? 
Why is it called “the sole difference”?
The basis of buddhahood is pristine consciousness [ye shes]; 
the basis of sentient beinghood is not pristine consciousness. 
When both the primordial state (ye) and recognition (shes pa) are combined, 
it is the sublime transcendent state of the buddhas.
I really think you need to reconsider your arrogance on this point. There are people here who understand Dzogchen far better than you. You should listen to them. On the Guru, for example, another of the 17 Tantras, the Precious Introduction Tantra, states:
Investigating into the intimate instructions of the Guru, one reaches the extent of effortless self-liberation.
The Rig pa Rang shar, the commentary tantra of Dzogchen, also chimes in the faults of not obtaining empowerments. Now mind you, this does not mean that one necessarily needs some kind of empowerment into an outer mandala and so on, as the Rig pa Rang Shar makes clear. That depends on the faculties of the student. But this tantra makes it absolutely clear that one must receive at least direct introduction from a proper master:
The faults of not obtaining the empowerment are as follows: in the bardo one is alarmed, panicked, exhausted, impeded and one can also lose consciousness. 
“While one has not left the body of traces, migrating beings will not see one as worthy of respect. One’s merit will be small, one’s life short, one’s enjoyments of living will be few, one will be powerless and many obstacles will occur. Nothing will be accomplished. Those are the faults of not obtaining the empowerment for the conduct of Secret Mantra. A yogin of Secret Mantra conduct must first obtain empowerment. If empowerment is not obtained, not even the Buddha will be able to turn the wheel on the stage of a tathāgata. If the wheel cannot be turned, then the nirmanakāya will not be able to benefit migrating beings with compassion. Therefore, the empowerment of the conduct of Secret Mantra must be obtained.
The root tantra of all Dzogchen teachings, the Sgra thal gyur, states:
Serve the guru as equal to a buddha
by pleasing him/her with activities of body and speech.
And:
The Dharma is in accord with the transmission of the Guru.
Finally, since you like the Kun byed rgyal po, then heed what it says:

Without an authentic master, like the scripture of a monkey, 
the basis and path will be erroneous, indeed one will be seized by conceptuality.
Therefore, like applying ferrous sulfate to gold, the precious master
should be paid with a gem of inestimable value.
This is also part of the lung called rtsal chen sprug pa, one of the five lungs brought to Tibet by Vairocana.

The Great Garuda, another one of the five lungs and also part of the Kun byed rgyal po states:
The virtuous mentor is like a precious jewel which produces everything.
Unsupported, not depending on places of transformation,
he fulfills hope through his excellent inner nature.
When examined, nothing; but he has the great excellence of producing a variety for others.
Finally, you should heed Mañjuśrīmitra [Garab Dorje's main disciple], who states in yet another of the five lungs brought by Vairocana, the Meditation of Awakened Mind:
Subtle and difficult to understand, this path of the great seer is beyond nonconceptuality and conceptuality,
difficult to analyze and difficult to explain, free from conventional expressions,
inaccessible through words, while it is not shared with the domain of others and all of the immature,
this meaning can here be seen through those definitive scriptures of the Teacher and the experiential intimate instructions of the gurus.
So, given these definitive statements in original texts of the Dzogchen tradition, you can see why no one agrees with your baseless and harmful assertions. However, you are free to following the three words of Jim Valby:
Introduce yourself to some delusion.
Spread it as widely as possible. 
Continue in that state forever.
Because that is all you are doing, sad to say.

Of course we should stick to tradition and don't become secular buddhist or something strange like that. But especially when using tantric methods, it is very important for them to be connected with the place you are practising. Otherwise they just don't really work that much! Himalayan plants are no more special or more connected with spirits than any other special plants from other areas of the world. So everybody that stated that "you should stick to tradition", please ask yourself, what the real essence of the tradition is.

Malcolm wrote:
Actually, when using these things, you should be very aware of the environmental impact you are having. For example, in Tibetan Medicine, it is held that one should use medicines from one's region, as these will be the most potent for you. Also, the trees from which gugul, sandalwood oil, myrrh, frankincense, aloes [agar] and so on are extracted endangered.

In Mexico, there are over 5,000 plant species useful for medicine, and very little of it has been documented in one place, much less made accessible for non-Indians to understand and use.

As far as Himalayan plants go, however, they have a special potency because of the altitude at which they grow. Alpine instances of a plant are held to be stronger than an instance grown at a lower altitude. Why? Because the distance between flower and root is shorter, and therefore the plant as a whole is held to be more potent.

She also does not support free college tuition [boo].

The only place where she gained traction with Sanders was on gun control.

But I happen to agree with Bernie on this point. He voted against the Brady Bill because IT DID NOT SUPPORT INSTANT BACKGROUND CHECKS. It is also true that VT is a rural state with the lowest rates of gun violence in the US, etc. This is why Sanders has the position on guns that he does. People in VT hunt for food. It is a poor state. Gun policies that are good for cities are not necessarily appropriate for rural areas.

Loppon-la,

Can you tell us what the difference is between a mantra and a dharani? In at least one entry from the gZungs 'Dus, the title says it's a dharani, but then in the body of the sutra, it says to recite this "mantra" X number of times. Is there an actual traditional definition of a dharani?

Thank you.

Malcolm wrote:
A dhāraṇī, properly speaking, is a formula for recalling the Dharma and developing wisdom and removing nonvirtues which can cause problems.

Generally, we find a description of three mantras: guhyamantras, vidyāmantras and dhāraṇī-mantras. A text called the Abhisamayavibhaṅga by Atisha statesz:
Because of protecting against mundane thoughts with reality, there are so-called secret mantras. As such, because of giving arise to special knowledge when invoked again and again, there are vidyāmantras. In order generate unfailing recollection of bodhicitta, there are dhāraṇī-mantras.
Further, an interesting text called the sGra sbyor bam po gnyis pa gives the following definitions:
A so-called mantra is mantregupti bhāśaṇe, i.e. because it is a description of the deities of mantra being summoned and secret, it is called "secret mantra." So-called "vidyā" is vidajñāna: it is name of abiding as the form of a deity in order counteract ignorance. So called "dhāraṇi" is artha granṭha dhārayati dhāraṇi: a name for not forgetting the meaning and the words of Mantra Dharma and obtaining a specific stage, thus, "dhāraṇimantra."
Further, we can make four more distinctions:  dhāraṇis that become the cause of a bodhisattvas obtaining patience, Secret Mantra dhāraṇis, dhāraṇi of Dharma and dhāraṇi of meaning. This distinction is found in the commentary on the Prajñāpāramita by Daṃṣṭrasena.

The first kind is a result of attaining patience for emptiness because of meditating with wisdom and mindfulness.

The second is a dhāraṇī mantra that possesses the power of blessings is a dhāraṇī of Secret Mantra because of an aspiration that was made to remove negativities for sentient beings.

Third, the dhāraṇī of Dharma is when bodhisattvas on the stages listen to buddhas and bodhisattvas no matter how many words of Dharma there are held and recalled with wisdom as they were explained, and this ability to not forget them for a long time is called dhāraṇi of Dharma.

Finally, the dhāraṇī of meaning simply remembering the Dharma terms of the paths, perfections, and so on.

So, my understanding is that dhāraṇis that come from sutra do not require transmission. Dhāraṇis that come from tantra, may, depending on the level of tantra. It seems that many dhāraṇis that seem to require transmission in the Tibetan tradition do not require transmission in East Asian traditions.

More research should be done because there are so many dhārṇis that do not have explicit rites of transmissions connected with them.

The following is just one possibility, an interpretation, by one practitioner.

I feel that if you could travel back in time to meet the person who was the historical Buddha, before all the legends and hagiographical writings which (perhaps as a possibility) imposed a potentially idealized image on who he was, you would meet a man, a human being. He may have been a very special man, with great gifts, but just a man. If so, there is a good chance that he exhibited more ordinary human emotions than we give him credit for, and might have had some buttons that could be pushed at a certain point like most people.

On the other "one hand clapping" hand, if one is speaking of the "Big B" Buddha which represents emptiness, all reality and then some ... there is no separate you me or the other guy, nothing lacking ... thus no anger is possible.

The historical man who was buddha and ol' "Big B" are not two.

Just one opinion to toss into the stew, and not intended as the final word on Buddhism.

Astus said:
The discourses in the sutra are supposedly spoken explanations. Since Mahamati and the Buddha are talking to each other, it is out of place to say that "apart from spoken explanations". Making an exception of verbal communication is problematic whether the sutra is meant as a spoken discourse or as a written text. If it is a spoken discourse, the whole sutra is an exception, like any other sutra. If it is a written text, it negates everything found there, including the stated exception. So, unlike other versions of the Lankavatara, the Tibetan seems to be in error.

Malcolm wrote:
Actually, what they are discussing, as is very clear from the Tibetan, is the deficiency of text [letters, yi ge, akṣara ] in conveying meaning. The term being translated as "word" in the text is śabda, sound. The text says the fault is that sounds/words can fall down into letters. It then contrasts letters with spoken explanations, and then points out that even spoken explanations are deluded, because they are made in accordance with the inclination of deluded sentient beings. So no, while the Tibetan translating is not inaccurate, the Chinese translations do not manage to convey the real nuances of the passage, sorry to say.

In the first passage you cited, the Buddha is saying that sounds [ śabda ] and meanings are not different, because sounds can lead to understanding. He never says that reading or text can. This is because Buddhadharma is and always will be a oral tradition based on verbal explanations that are heard by students.



Astus said:

Malcolm wrote:
There are several statements on the importance of good friends already in the early discourses (e.g. "the whole of the holy life" in the Upaddha Sutta ). However, it does not address the difference between written and oral communication. That sutta itself explains that the importance of a good friend is visible in the fact that the Buddha himself taught the noble eightfold path, based on which beings can attain liberation. In another discourse ( AN 8.54 ) the Buddha teaches that lay people should learn virtue, generosity and discernment by associating with good lay friends. But that doesn't mean they could not learn the same qualities by listening to the Buddha and his monastic disciples, since there are quite a few cases where people gain faith and insight from a single teaching. Good friends are also said ( AN 9.1 ) to be a prerequisite for developing the wings to self-awakening, because through them one learns the Dharma. The reason for it being a prerequisite is because one has to learn of the teachings. It does not say that the source is limited to face to face communication using voice.[/quote]

Your objection has nothing to do with the passage at hand. There are so many other passages just like it, it would take days to collect and translate them all. There is absolutely no precedence in the sūtras for the idea that you can learn Buddhadharma by reading books.

This is one instance where Zhanran was discussing the pervasive quality of Buddha-nature, but nonetheless, he's discussing here the Tientai view that the Dharmakaya is indisitinguishable from the Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya - ie. the primordial Buddha has Dharmakaya, Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya, all three without beginning or end.

Malcolm wrote:
No one ever said the three kāyas were separable.

In Dzogchen it is held that from the point of view of the basis, the three kāyas are the dharmakāya; from the point of view of the path, the three kāyas are the sambhogakāya; from the point of view of result, the three kāyas are the nirmanakāya. The three kāyas are always inseparable.

The reason there is a "difference" between them has to do the fact that ordinary sentient beings and bodhisattvas on the lower stages can see only the nirmanakāya; higher bodhisattvas can see the sambhogakāya; only buddhas can see the dharmakāya.

In other words, Samantabhadra, the dharmakāya, always has a sambhogakāya and a nirmanakāya Why? For as long as there are deluded sentient beings, the buddhas appear to teach them.

I agree with Malcolm on the incompleteness of the texts. I've studied with teachers from every vehicle, and the "how to" is never clearly spelled out in the texts I've seen. The Pali suttas are pretty detailed with meditation, but even these aren't really like how meditation is taught by teachers. Especially with Zen, there's no way to know by yourself if you "get" a koan. The best you can do is piece together something like zazen in non-Sutric commentaries, and even then I would bet most people get it wrong. Heck, I got it wrong even under the supervision of a teacher, and I doubt I'm unusual in this aspect. And Dogen, the big promoter of non-koan zazen, says you need to have a teacher. In fact, out of the whole history of zen, you have maybe one or two Chinul like characters out of probably hundreds of thousands of dedicated students. This is liek planning your retirement around winning the lottery. Sure, it could happen, but the chances are so low to be negligible.

Anyone who has meditated in a group knows there is a far different energy at play than when meditating alone. So to say there's nothing transmitted, out of fear for sounding New Age, I think is nonsense. There's an energy at work there, just like there's an energy at work when you play board games live instead of over the internet, or have a face to face conversation over texting.

Then there is a logical problem. Buddhism generally tells us we have a knowledge problem, we start off in ignorance. To think that an ignorant person can guide themselves out of ignorance seems specious at best.

What I am claiming is that oral communication and teaching is different than reading. For example, our conversation here is dry and logical [at least my side of the conversation is]. If we were talking, or I was listening to you teach Dharma, there is a qualitatively different sort of communication happening.

Astus said:
That is meta-communication, all those other things that go on during a face-to-face conversation. It is not a matter of words being pronounced or written. Then there are two options to maintain that orality is the only way of communicating the Dharma: either that words combined with other signifiers/expressions transmit the whole, or that words are irrelevant and only the other expressions convey the meaning. It also raises the question if anything can be communicated at all through the written form.

One of the advantages of texts is exactly their "dry and logical" nature (although I wouldn't dismiss the literary arts as capable of more than that). Unlike spontaneous verbal communication, writing generally requires some focus and organising of thoughts, except perhaps instant messaging.
The Buddha also addresses this issue later on in the text, beginning on folio 212/a of the Lhasa edition:
That being the case, therefore Mahāmati, apart from spoken explanations, the Buddha and the other bodhisattvas have taught "The Tathāgatas have never explained and will never explain even a single letter." Why? For this reason, because in all Dharmas there are no letters, in absence of the meaning [the Dharma] cannot be explained. There is an explanation through taking hold of concepts. Mahāmati, if Dharma is not explained, the doctrine will perish. If the doctrine perishes, there will be no buddhas, pratyekabuddhas and śravakas.
"For this reason, Mahamati, it is declared in the canonical text by myself and other Buddhas and Bodhisattvas that not a letter is uttered or answered by the Tathagatas. For what reason? Because truths are not dependent on letters. It is not that they never declare what is in conformity with meaning; when they declare anything, it is according to the discrimination [of all beings]. If, Mahamati, the truth is not declared1 [in words] the scriptures containing all truths will disappear, and when the scriptures disappear there will be no Buddhas, Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and Bodhisattvas; and when there is no one [to teach], what is to be taught and to whom?"
(Lankavatara Sutra, 3.76)

There is no mention of an exception for "spoken explanations" in Suzuki's translation. In T670 it says "我等諸佛及諸菩薩，不說一字、不答一字。" (We, all buddhas, and all bodhisattvas, don't say a word, don't respond a word.), in T671 it says "是故我經中說，諸佛如來乃至不說一字不示一名" (It is because I say in the scriptures, all buddha-tathagatas don't go as far as saying a single word or giving a single name.), , and in T672 it says "我經中說，我與諸佛及諸菩薩，不說一字不答一字。" (I say in the scriptures, I, and all buddhas, and all bodhisattvas, don't say a word, don't respond a word). So, neither of the three Chinese Lankavatara translations speak of such an exception.

( Lankavatara Sutra, 3.65)

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddha also addresses this issue later on in the text, beginning on folio 212/a of the Lhasa edition:

Mahāmati, those foolish men say the following, "The meaning is exactly the words. The meaning is not other than the words. Why? For this reason: since there is no substance in the meaning, the meaning is not other than the words. The word itself is the meaning." 

Mahāmati, since the nature of words are not understood, those with uneducated mind cannot understand that how words arise and perish and the meaning does not arise and does not perish. 

Mahāmati, words fall into letters. The meaning does not fall into letters, not arising and lacking substance because of being free from entities and nonentities. 

Mahāmati, because letters are not perceived to either exist or not exist, the Tathāgātas do not teach a Dharma that falls into letters.

Mahāmati, because there are no letters in the Dharma, whoever explains a Dharma that falls into letters, he is twisted up. That being the case, therefore Mahāmati, apart from spoken explanations, the Buddha and the other bodhisattvas have taught "The Tathāgatas have never explained and will never explain even a single letter." Why? For this reason, because in all Dharmas there are no letters, in absence of the meaning [the Dharma] cannot be explained. There is an explanation through taking hold of concepts. 

Mahāmati, if Dharma is not explained, the doctrine will perish. If the doctrine perishes, there will be no buddhas, pratyekabuddhas and śravakas. If they do not exist, for whom will there be an explanation? 

That being the case, therefore Mahāmati, bodhisattva mahāsattvas must not be attached the words of the spoken explanations. 

Mahāmati, since the spoken explanations exist in accordance with the inclinations of sentient beings, they are erroneous. I and all other tathāgata, arhat, samyaksambuddhas teach the Dharma to interested sentient beings in order to reverse their minds, intellects and consciousnesses. All phenomena are nonexistent appearances. Because they are understood as appearances of one's mind, the realization of one's own sublime wisdom can never be reversed by many kinds of false concepts. 

Mahāmati, bodhisattvas mahāsattvas must rely on the meaning, they must not rely on letters. 

Mahāmati, the sons and daughters of good families who rely on letters will be deprived of the meaning, and further, will not understand it. They will not being learned in the characteristics of all the Dharmas and the stages, and they will have as their associates evil intellectuals who do not understand the sentences and the certain words will fall into evil views.

Astus said:
We can certainly come to understand the meaning of the Dharma by studying with a teacher. We can never come to understand the meaning of the Dharma merely by reading books.
Does a teacher gives any Dharma not contained in the sutras? If yes, then his teaching fails to follow the Dharma of the buddhas. If no, then sutras are both valid and beneficial sources of the Dharma.

The above explanation by the Buddha establishes that a "sūtra" is not something which is in the letters of a text, nor in the words. It is in the meaning as spoken verbally.

For example, the name of a teaching like Kalacakra, does not mean that the real Kalacakra can be found in the book called Kalacakra. Just as the real Prajñāpāramitā cannot be found in all the books that bear that name. The meaning of Kalackara and Prajñāpāramitā can only be learned from a teacher, never from the books themselves.
Prajnaparamita is not obtained from anyone or anything. How could a person today instruct in that better than the Buddha?

"Wherever this sutra is taught, read, recited, copied, or wherever it is to be found, one should build a seven-jeweled stupa of great height and width and richly ornamented. There is no need to put a relic inside. Why is this? Because the Tathāgata is already in it. ... the highest, complete enlightenment of all the bodhisattvas is within this sutra.

One characteristic of rituals of Bon origin is that at the beginning of the rite there is a narrative of its origin. Look at ChNN's description of Sang on page 109 of Drung, Deu and Bon.

No one is denying Buddhist appropriation of some native Tibetan rites like Sang, but there is not even one single rite of Sang that was translated from Sanskrit to Tibetan. The Sang offering attributed to Padmasambhava was written in Tibet. Also this Sang offering shows evidence of having been converted from a Bonpo rite because like other Bonpo rites and Sang, it contains a narrative of its origin.

Offering of incense as a object of scent and Sang, which is used for purification, have totally different functions. In ancient Tibetan culture, nomads would have newcomers to their camp pass through Sang smoke to prevent contagious diseases. They mainly used juniper, but also many other aromatic plants as well. The principle of Sang and the principle of smudging in Native American cultures is very similar.

Look, obviously being blind or deaf makes study and practice more difficult, but I don't accept that it makes them impossible. For Vajrayana, maybe, but otherwise no.

I am not sure there is any such material, because to really know the influence of Bon on Buddhism and vice versa, one would need to thoroughly know both traditions, their source texts, their histories etc. Some say that rites such as Namkha, Lungta, Sur and Sang are of Bon origin (and they probably are).

Yes, they are, as well as the custom of making tormas.

I heard Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche say that all of Bonpo style vajrayana (or whatever it is called in Bon tradition) is completely made up and copied from elements of Buddhist vajrayana and that the only original teaching of Bon having parallel in Buddhism is their short dzogchen tantra called Shang Shung Nyen Gyu.

Malcolm wrote:
Bonpo "Vajrayāna" is called "Secret Mantra."

ChNN does not say made up, he says "borrowed", and also he maintains in Drung De'u and Bon that the tantric cycles connected with Nangzher Lodpo such as Zhang Zhung Me ri [a tantric cycle], Zhang Zhung sNyan rgyud and Sems sde [Dzogchen cycles, the latter being A khrid] are not dependent on Buddhist sources, the latter have however been influenced by Dzogchen from Garab Dorje.

Sūtras and tantras are not written documents. The written documents that record them are merely a shadow of verbal discourse that took place at some time. The meaning of those documents is not contained within the documents.

We can certainly come to understand the meaning of the Dharma by studying with a teacher. We can never come to understand the meaning of the Dharma merely by reading books.

For example, the name of a teaching like Kalacakra, does not mean that the real Kalacakra can be found in the book called Kalacakra. Just as the real Prajñāpāramitā cannot be found in all the books that bear that name. The meaning of Kalackara and Prajñāpāramitā can only be learned from a teacher, never from the books themselves.

Q: "So, the deaf cannot really learn the Dharma?"
A: "When we discuss what constitutes a precious human birth, having all sense faculties intact is one of the requirements."

This is unclear and confusing. Surely it is not meant that the deaf cannot learn the Dharma because they cannot  hear the Dharma. Would the Dharma be then dependent on sound waves vibrating air which in turn vibrates the inner ear? Is it a requirement that one not be blind or deaf to be considered human?

Malcolm wrote:
You should acquaint yourself with the eight freedoms and ten favorable conditions that constitute a precious human birth, not just any old human birth.

With respect to having complete sense organs intact, if one does not, for example, it makes one unsuitable to be a Vajrayāna practitioner.

With respect to studying common Dharma, in ancient times blind people were less at a disadvantage than the deaf. These days the people with sensory deficits are at less of a disadvantage because of modern technology, but I wager there are very few blind people who participate on the forum.

To answer Dzogchungpa's question, the main criteria is organs of sight and hearing.

To answer Garuda Vista's question, in Dzogchen there are techniques for blind people.

But in general we have to understand that precious human birth has very precise criteria which indicates the ease with which one may meet and study Dharma.

Astus said:
Who counts as a capable teacher depends on whom one likes. Thus both the best and the worst can gather a large community where both call the other incompetent. How to tell which one is correct? That's when one has to start learning from the Buddha himself by reading his words. And if that's not enough, there are numerous traditionally approved masters, like Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Asanga and Vasubandhu to consult with. And if even that's not enough, there are quite a few generally reliable works by modern teachers, like the Dalai Lama, Thrangu Rinpoche, Thich Nhat Hanh, Hsing Yun, Sheng Yen, etc.

Buddha Dharma is described as an oral tradition to the present, even with all these texts available.

Thank you for that clear explanation. I do have two follow-on questions.

If, for some reason, the student was not whole heartedly present, and wasn't able to experience something, is it possible to gain direct experience without receiving another pointing out instruction from the master again at a later date?

Specifically, I'm thinking of practice texts such as Pointing Out the Dharmakaya, Clarifying the Natural State, or The Ocean of Definitive Meaning. One reads those texts, not for conceptual understanding (although that may happen), but as tools for working with experience. In your opinion, is it possible to have a successful pointing out by working with those texts (with the blessing of the guru of course)?

Malcolm wrote:
The principle of these mahāmudra texts is completely different and much more gradual. If you read these books and work with them without a teacher, it is possible you can have a sutra-like experience of śamatha and vipaśyāna, you can even become a first stage bodhisattva, but that does not mean you will have discovered the rig pa that Dzogchen is talking about.

If you want proof, my friend, I suggest you discover this for yourself. But put in simple terms, all sentient beings have minds, and the essence of those minds is inseparable clarity and emptiness — there is no Dzogchen apart from that.

Seeing into the Nature of the Mind has been accomplished by mystics throughout history. Rigpa has been experienced by mystics of other religions throughout history, most with teachers, and some on their own.

That's a big claim.  Prove it.

Actually, saying that everyone who receives direct introduction experiences rigpa, if only for a moment, or even that there is such a thing as "rigpa", somehow known to be the same kind of thing for all dzogchenpas, is also quite a big claim IMO, and I would be very interested to see a proof of it as well. I understand that this is the Dzogchen forum, but it's an interesting question.

Malcolm wrote:
Dzogchen is a living transmission, from one person to another, one by one. There is no other way it can be. This is not a limitation, this is heart of the teachings. Without transmission from another living breathing human being, there is no Dzogchen, in this case then "dzogchen" is a bunch of concepts written in words on paper.

The question is whether Pointing Out Instructions can be effective if they are read from Terma, like "Self-Liberation Through Seeing With Naked Awareness," by Guru Padmasambhava. I would submit that, yes, they can.

anjali said:
If one has received the pointing out instructions, but didn't "get it" at the time, is it possible in your opinion to later "get it" while reading a text?

Malcolm wrote:
If one has received direct introduction, it is possible that you may understand something more clearly with such a text, but since direct introduction works with experiences, there is no way one can substitute this conceptual understanding for working with the transmission by means of working with various experiences until one discovers the basis, aka primordial state, for oneself and has stabilizes that knowledge [rig pa].

The reason? Direct introduction works with experiences to show what the foundation that lies below experiences, thoughts and concepts, i.e. the mind essence. This is extremely subtle and cannot be discovered merely through reading books, no matter how holy or profound. The error, quite frankly, is mistaking the fact that we are aware with that awareness being the mind essence itself. The awareness that we experience moment to moment is quite coarse, and is dominated by our "energy," our rlung or vāyu. The mind essence is much more subtle than any awareness we can experience.

Direct introduction, received from a master who knows what it is he is introducing, is indispensable — it sets up the foundation for our later discovery of our own state even if at the time the experience was too subtle for us to register it clearly. Anytime anyone participates in a direct introduction with a realized master in a whole hearted openly collaborative way [rather than passively expecting something to happen], they will in fact experience that moment of knowledge [rig pa] the master intends to introduce. Even if they do not "grasp" it at the time, they will have that experience to carry with them. In the beginning, our concepts are very strong, and our ability to see the mind essence is very weak. Therefore, our moment of rig pa we experience in the direct introduction is something like a small branch caught up in a torrent of a river of concepts — it is very easily swept away. But if we are patient, and we are diligent, we can again have that experience of the mind essence, upon which all future practice depends. Why? Because it was introduced and we had it once. There is nothing at all mystical about the process, it is straightforward and nonmagical.

The process of reading is too conceptual, the mind involved is too coarse, and therefore, it is impossible that we can experience the mind essence from reading a text. However, if we have experienced the mind essence reading books such as the Chos dbying mdzod and so on can reinforce our confidence which we can bring to our practice.

In order to experience the mind essence we have to cut through coarse concepts with various methods to re-experience the mind essence that we were exposed to during the introduction. This is why we have practices such as rushen and semszin, and supremely, Song of the Vajra.

If empowerment is not obtained, not even the Buddha will be able to turn the wheel on the stage of a tathāgata. If the wheel cannot be turned, then the nirmanakāya will not be able to benefit migrating beings with compassion. Therefore, the empowerment of the conduct of Secret Mantra must be obtained.

The other way is reception through Terma, which is a written record of oral teachings made for a future time. If a Direct Introduction were only possible from a living master, the Terma would be without any purpose at all. The Terma are both oral teachings and contain the lineage as well.

Malcolm wrote:
Termas are revealed by people who have already studied and practiced and attained realization. They are not revealed by people with no training and no realization. Moreover, there is even training in how to reveal tertons. The teachers of Tertons are almost always tertons themselves.

For a Direct Introduction to the Nature of your Mind, please read, "Self-Liberation Through Seeing With Naked Awareness," by Guru Padmasambhava, translated by John Reynolds. It is available on your Kindle or in print.

This not a direct introduction. One cannot receive direct introduction from a book.
I understand what you are saying. But I would not consider ancient texts formerly "Sealed, Sealed, Sealed," to be in the category of books. Many of these are in fact "Direct Oral Instructions" that in fact Dzogchen students of the past had no access to without a lung. And then, perhaps only one of these was read to them, one or a few times.

You have to understand the extraordinary times we live in. I have many secret texts along with explanations given by masters. Instead of hearing just a few of them a limited number of times, I can internalize these sacred texts dependent upon the extent of my devotion. Reading, studying, and internalizing these ancient original formerly secret texts are every bit as effective as hearing them. One can be liberated in this manner. As a lifetime student of religion, I fully appreciate the extraordinary development of having access to material that I would have had to travel to Tibet in hopes of finding when I first began to study religion.

I am not talking about reading books "about Dzogchen" with their conversational descriptions. I am talking about original pith instructions which can put one in the state of Intrinsic Awareness, one's Primordial State, simply by reading them, if one is receptive. You have to have lived long enough to fully understand the extraordinary nature of this development in the history of religion.

Malcolm wrote:
Look, I think we are talking about two entirely different things. Someone who reads Dzogchen texts without having had the benefit of a real transmission and explanation cannot receive transmission even from the most profound writing of ancient upadeshas written on a page. They might find them inspiring, but they won't discover anything and they will just remain in a state of concepts.

This is quite different than finding inspiration in those same instructions that have been communicated to you by a qualified teacher.

steve_bakr said:
I fully endorse having a personal teacher, most definitely. It is the nature of these texts, however, that listening to your teacher does not transmit the complete sentence by sentence density of the line by line liberating pith teachings contained in these secret texts. Much of what teachers present is the background understanding and preparation necessary to understand what is contained in these texts. A teacher will also judge your personal capabilities, and intsruct you accordingly. There are three kinds of students: the superior, the intermediate, and the inferior.

Malcolm wrote:
What the teacher communicates is the essence of those instructions. That living relationship with a master enlivens those instructions because the instructions are then connected with transmission. Without transmission, the instructions have no life.

This is not a barrier to understanding individual teachers. On the contrary it is an essential part of the Buddhadharma's transition to the west.

That transition is still ongoing. In fact it is early days in that process.
We are having to make policy on the hoof. That will go on for a hundred years or more at least.

Students of Buddhadharma in the west may need to be as robust in the discussion of these issues ( the authenticity or otherwise of specific teachers ) as they are vis-a-vis climate change or capitalism, without that being seen as somehow adharmic.

Paul, yes, I genuinely think that this is a bad idea too. I know how controversial this sounds, but it is actually the same karmic situation I outlined and no criticism could be helpful. My capacity for explaining such complex topics is not that high, and seeing how easy my words are misinterpreted here I would not even try to elaborate further. But I think that there is only one thing which is truly helpful in dealing with cult leaders and harmful teachers - presenting a strong example of a genuine path. This is the only way out and the only true help we can give. Everything else will destroy us in the end, no matter how good the initial intentions are. I believe this is also, incidentally, in harmony with the precepts of the Buddadharma.
I have to disagree completely then. Warning someone away from a cult is never a bad thing, as the cult cannot lead to liberation. Certainly when it starts to involve tantra and samaya issues. A group like that, and as I mention there is a rather active and highly negative cult here in the UK, is worse than poison. Poison can only harm you in one life.

I'm honestly not sure that you're saying this, but allowing someone to go down a harmful path because 'it's their karma' in some way is not compassionate.

People are free, and it is not our job to condition anyone to follow any path at all, whether we think it is a good one or not.

Providing info is one thing, strongly conditioning others is another. If someone wants to worship the Gyalpo, this may be a pity, but it is not our job to try and force them or convert them from that path. All we can do is point out what masters such as HHDL, ChNN and so on say about it. If they want to listen, fine, if not, then fine.

I don't think that it is arguable to say there is unanimity of opinion on this.

HHDL " Dzogchen: Heart Essence of the Great Perfection ": Question: Certain Nyingma masters have expounded shentong- emptiness of other-as the view of Dzogchen. Do you agree with them? Why is shentong such a controversial view among Tibetan Buddhist philosophers?

HHDL: If we read the writings of the great scholar Mipham, especially his commentary on the Sublime Continuum, we find that he explicitly mentions the importance of understanding the Dzogchen view, in which one is able to combine the teachings of emptiness, as expounded in the wisdom sütras of the second turning of the wheel of Dharma, with the sütras belonging to the third turning of the wheel of Dharma, particularly the Essence of Buddhahood Sutra. The understanding developed through a combination of the views expounded in both turnings of the wheel of Dharma will enable us to appreciate what in Dzogchen terminology are called: primordial purity, which is the main subject matter of the second turning, and spontaneous presence, which is the main subject matter of the third turning of the wheel of Dharma.

However, this does not mean that the emptiness spoken of in the second turning, that is in the wisdom sütras, is exactly the same as what in Dzogchen terminology is called primordial purity. But one thing which is clear is that without an understanding of emptiness as expounded in the wisdom sutras, and without taking that understanding as a basis, there is no way that you can understand primordial purity in the context of Dzogchen.

As for the question of whether spontaneous presence in Dzogchen is synonymous with what is called the tathagatagarbha- the essence of buddhahood or innate mind of clear light-in the third turning of the wheel of Dharma, especially in the Essence of Buddhahood Sutra, there do seem to be divergent views on that, even among Nyingma meditators and scholars.

Malcolm wrote:
Because you don't understand Dzogchen, you really can't appreciate what HHDL is saying here.

1) There is the question of whether it is really proper to try an understand Dzogchen on the basis of sūtra. I personally question the entire context of HHDL's comments. Dzogchen is not part of the three turnings, not at all.

2) The main controversy HHDL mentions is whether is proper to consider tathāgatagarbha as presented in sūtra to be the same as lhun grub or not.

This is just not the same thing as conflating Yogacara and Dzogchen. Tathāgatagarbha has a very subordinate role in Yogacara. It is almost entirely ignored.

That's an interesting question. Even if the bliss associated with full awakening is deeper than mere liberation, it is not a great degree of liberation, but rather, a quality associated with the result of the path.

There are basically five paths and ten stages. Paths measure realizations, stages measure qualities. There are also four kinds of realized persons, which are in fact measures of liberation from latent afflictions. The measure of full liberation is an arhat, pratyekabuddha, or an eighth stage bodhisattva, because only arhats, pratyekabuddhas and eighth stage bodhisattvas on up are free from birth in the three realms. However, the difference between the former two and the latter are the qualities cultivated on the path and the depth of realization. Arhats and pratyekabuddhas do not necessarily realize the emptiness of phenomena, and they do not necessarily comprehend the nonarising of phenomena.

In that respect, just as a rishi possesses the five clairvoyances and a pure eye, in the same way bodhisattvas generate bodhicitta, and after they attain patience for the nonarising of phenomena, it is observed that they attain the full perfect buddhahood of unsurpassed perfect complete awakening.
One who does not attain any phenomena, where is nirvana for one such as he? The Tathāgatas introduce them to awakening, and having generated bodhicitta, they do not abide in samsara and they also do not attain nirvana.

Son of Buddha said:
Sure there us a self apart from persons and phenomena.

Here is Ju Mipham’s gloss on 9:23, from the new Dharmachakra version of Sutralamkara: In the absence of the twofold self of persons and phenomena, this is the actual nature of things, the supreme nature of the abiding reality, the intrinsic nature or essence itself. In achieving this, the buddhas have achieved a nature that is of complete purity. Thus, [to actualize] the suchness that is the unmistaken way things are is to be “the self of great beings.” This self is not the same as the conceived object that is involved when apprehending the twofold self because such a self has no bearing on things as they are.

The Self of great beings(suchness) is apart from the self of persons and phenomena

Malcolm wrote:
This is just a manner of speaking.




Son of Buddha said:
If the snake and the rope are the same thing, we should also see a snake when we see a rope.
The snake is an illusion that's very existence is predicated upon the rope which is its source, which again the fact remains when you see the illusion of the snake what you are actually seeing is the rope ........either way the illusion of the  snake and the rope are the SAME object.

Malcolm wrote:
No, if they were the same object, we would always see a snake when we see a rope.


Son of Buddha said:
Since we do not see a snake when we see a rope, and we do not see rope when we see a snake, we can understand that in fact the former perception is accompanied by knowledge and the latter perception is accompanied by ignorance.
Yep I agree, still doesn't change the fact that whether you see an snake or a rope you are looking at the same object(misperception doesn't change that)

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, misperception does change that. Ignorance does not have an object of valid perception, that is why it is ignorance.



Son of Buddha said:
We can understand that rope and the snake are just not the same thing. If they were the same thing, when one was seen, the other must always be seen. For example, when we fire, it is always accompanied by heat.
What????....... If we look at the SAME OBJECT and you see a baseball and I see an softball it still doesn't change the fact we are looking at the SAME OBJECT.

Malcolm wrote:
In order to maintain this position, you would have to maintain that the water that you see and the pus and blood that a pretas sees are the same thing, something which objectively exists apart from your perception of it.

Son of Buddha said:
Likewise, If the self and the suchness are the same thing, we should also see a self when we see suchness.
The numerous Tathagatagarbha Sutras state that Suchness is the True Self,(different words used to describe the same thing)

Malcolm wrote:

Nirvana Sutra
Chapter Six: On the Virtue of the Name

V199.   “Then the Tathagata spoke again to Kasyapa: “O good man! You should now uphold all the words, chapters, clauses and all the virtues thereof of this sutra. Any good man or woman who hears the name of this sutra will never get born into the four realms [of hell, hungry ghost, animal, and asura]. Why not? I shall now expound to you all the virtues of this sutra and all that is practised by innumerable boundless Buddhas.”

V200.   Bodhisattva Kasyapa said to the Buddha: “O World-Honoured One! What is this sutra to be called? How should Bodhisattva-mahasattvas uphold this sutra?” The Buddha said to Kasyapa: “The name of this sutra is to be “Mahaparinirvana”. The foremost word betokens “good”, the middle also “good”, and the final “good” too. The signification [of this sutra] is extremely deep, and what is written [in it] is good. The pureness of its arrangement is perfect, its action is pure, and its adamantine treasure-house is all-satisfying. Listen well, listen well! I shall now speak. O good man! The word “maha” betokens “eternal”. This is like all the great rivers draining into the great ocean. The same with this sutra. It crushes out all the bonds of illusion and all the qualities of Mara, and then body and life drain into “Mahaparinirvana”. Hence we say “Mahaparinirvana.” O good man! This is like a doctor who has a secret treatment embracing all medical treatments for disease. O good man! It is the same with the Tathagata. V201.   All the various wonderful doctrines taught and all the secret(esoteric) depths of meaning find their way into this Mahaparinirvana. That is why we say Mahaparinirvana. O good man! It is like a farmer who sows seed in spring. He entertains a rare wish. When he has finished the harvesting, all his longing is at an end. O good man! The same is the case with all beings. If we study other sutras, we always long for beautiful tastes. When one once hears this Mahaparinirvana, [however], one long ceases to covet the beautiful tastes mentioned in other sutras. This great Nirvana well enables all beings to cross the sea of all existences. O good man! Of all footprints, that of the elephant is the best. The same with this sutra. Of all the samadhis of the sutras, that of this sutra is the best. O good man! Of all the tillings of the field, that done in autumn is best.
V202.   The same with this sutra. It is the best of all sutras. It is like sarpirmanda, which is the best of all medicines. It thoroughly cures the feverish worries and madding minds of beings. This Great Nirvana is the foremost of all. O good man! It is like sweet butter which contains the eight tastes. The same also applies to this sutra. It contains the eight tastes. What are the eight? These are: 1) it is eternal, 2) it always is, 3) it is peaceful, 4) it is pure and cool, 5) it does not grow old, 6) it does not die, 7) it is taintless, and 8) it is pleasing and happy. These are the eight tastes. It possesses these eight tastes. This is why we say “Mahaparinirvana”. Now, all Bodhisattva-mahasattvas peacefully abide in this and manifest Nirvana in all places. That is why we say “Mahaparinirvna”. O Kasyapa! All good men and women who desire to enter Nirvana by this Mahaparinirvana must study well the fact that the Tathagata is eternal and that the Dharma and Sangha are eternal.”

V203.   Bodhisattva Kasyapa said to the Buddha: “All is wonderful, O World-Honoured One! We cannot conceive of the Tathagata’s depths of virtue. The same is the case with the virtues of Dharma and Sangha. This Mahaparinirvana is also inconceivable. One who studies this sutra will gain the right eye of Dharma and become a good doctor. Anybody who has not studied this sutra, we should know, is [like] a blind person, not possessing the eye of Wisdom and overshadowed by ignorance.”

Stacks up? So you're standing in judgement? But I'm sure you must not mean that.

But really Malcolm you know I've been an open book on this, indiscriminately disclosing in numerous places, verbosely, to the annoyance of not a few!

So I would toss this question back to others, who have not been forthcoming on what liberation means to them, though asked to on occasion.

For your part, I accept your recent dzogchen pointers, which as you know I had no particular objection to.

But look, when it comes to giving brief conventional pointers to what liberation means in one's particular case, the easiest shorthand is to find a reference point in the broad tradition, as you have done.

So to repeat briefly what I've already disclosed elsewhere my view can be summed up in that hoary old Ch'an adage, which goes something like: in the beginning mountains are mountains and rivers are rivers, then mountains are not mountains and rivers are not rivers, finally mountains are mountains and rivers are rivers. Of course this is merely the figurative version of the grammar of the Diamond Sutra: is, is not and therefore is.

So again as I've said elsewhere liberation for me can only be a liberation into the no-place of what's here, a letting go, a relinquishment into the only place possible. Now how that is realized or thought about, as sudden or gradual, innate or constructed, through rigorous training or shouting at the moon, through the dancing angels of logical disputation or the sudden plosh! of a duck landing on a pond, through visualizing herukas or other celestial beings or astral traveling - I'll leave for other worthies and dharma warriors to battle over.

But you others, you silent ones! What does liberation mean to you? Speak!

Malcolm wrote:
In Buddhadharma, liberation means only one thing and nothing more no matter whether we are talking about Hinayāna, Mahāyāna or Vajrayāna, including Dzogchen — liberation means freedom from afflictions that cause rebirth in the three realms and that is all.

Son of Buddha said:
Vasubandhu also said:

Vasubandhu on the Sutralamkara 9:23, Thurman translation:
23. In pure voidness buddhas achieve the supreme self of selflessness, and realize the spiritual greatness of the self by discovering the pure self.

Yes, and here,


As you can see the Buddha and other Buddhist masters distinguished different types of Atman, rejecting most form's but accepting their own interpretation of the term Atman.

Malcolm wrote:
Again, this is intentional language and is not to be taken literally. For example, in the comment on this passage {which is by Maitreya and not Vasubandhu], Sthiramati's Sūtrālaṃkāravṛttibhāṣya provides useful clarification here:
The term "self" in this context means "essence" [svabhāvatā], i.e., since the buddhas are are said to obtain the supreme self because of being the selfless essence. Since that is pure, the buddhas attain the pure supreme selfless self.
He continues in this vein:
The Buddha is the dharmakāya. Since the dharmakāya is emptiness, because there are not only no imputable personal entities in emptiness, there are also no imputable phenomenal entities, there are therefore no entities at all.
Now, someone may wish to counter "Sure, the imputed nature does not exist, but the perfect nature does exist," but Sthiramati responds to this:
The nature of the perfected does not exist. Since it does not exist in the same way the horn the hare of the imputed phenomena and persons, at that it is not defined as existent. It is also not a nonentity, because at that time suchness, the characteristic of the perfected exists.
This means that the perfected is not a substantial entity. It does exist however as a characteristic, and what is that characteristics, emptiness a.k.a suchness, which is not a self in any sense in which the word is used as an identifier, unless of course one wishes to claim, "The supreme identity is no identity" or "The supreme self is no self." This is precisely the meaning here. What this means is that this "self" is merely a designation and does not indicate anything real, any more than conventionally calling the stream of the aggregates a self does not indicate anything real.


Now, Sthiramati was a direct disciple of Vasubandhu, and I am quite sure he understands this text perfectly.


Son of Buddha said:
Consistent with this remark by Vasubandhu we see the Buddha using the term atman to refer to himself, and so on as a mere designation, etc. He never uses it to refer to a real entity, not even in the much vaunted Nirvana Sūtra.
In the very much vaunted Nirvana Sutra the Buddha does describe the Atman as real, he literally tells you the meaning of the term of Atman and says that it is real.

Malcolm wrote:
No, in the Nirvana Sutra, the Buddha is using intentional language that cannot be taken literally.

Further earlier in this chapter Maitreya declares at 9.4 "all phenomena are buddhahood," but according to your oft stated point of view, this is impossible since [buddha = self] and [self = not the aggregates] and so on.

So really, I think you need to rethink your literalism on these points.

Son of Buddha said:
What you are promoting is called the 4 perversions of the dharma, to think full enlightenment is not self is the 3rd perversion.


The Self’ signifies the Buddha; ‘the Eternal’ signifies the Dharmakaya; ‘Bliss’ signifies Nirvana, and ‘the Pure’ signifies Dharma. Bhiksus, why is it said that one who has the idea of a Self is arrogant and haughty, traversing round Samsara? Bhiksus, although you might say, ‘We also cultivate impermanence, suffering, and non-Self, these three kinds of cultivation have no real value/ meaning. I shall now explain the excellent three ways of cultivating Dharma. To think of suffering as Bliss and to think of Bliss as suffering, is perverse Dharma; to think of the impermanent as the Eternal and to think of the Eternal as impermanent is perverse Dharma; to think of the non-Self [anatman]as the Self [atman] and to think of the Self [atman] as non-Self [anatman] is perverse Dharma; t o think of the impure as the Pure and to think of the Pure as impure is perverse Dharma. Whoever has these four kinds of perversion, that person does not know the correct cultivation of dharmas.
V119.   These are called perversions/ inversions. Because of these perversions/ inversions, mundane people know the letters but not the meaning [referents]. What is the meaning/referent? Non-Self is Samsara, the Self is the Tathagata; impermanence is the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, the Eternal is the Tathagata’s Dharmakaya; suffering is all tirthikas, Bliss is Nirvana; the impure is all compounded [samskrta] dharmas , the Pure is the true Dharma that the Buddha and Bodhisattvas have. This is called non-perversion/ non-inversion. By not being inverted [in one’s views], one will know [both] the letter and the meaning. If one desires to be freed from the four perverse/ inverted [views – catur-viparita-drsti], one should know the Eternal, Blissful, the Self and the Pure in this manner.”

Well, no matter how Thanissaro Bikkhu interprets the particular sutta, his stance is unequivocal:
Multiply the four varieties of self by their three modes, and you have twelve types of theories about the self. All of these theories the Buddha rejects. He doesn't agree with any of them, because they all involve clinging, which is something you have to comprehend and let go. This means that his not-self teaching is not just negating specific types of self — such as a cosmic self, a permanent self, or an ordinary individual self. It negates every imaginable way of defining the self.

If it is asked, "How are we to understand that the expression, 'self', is an expression used to engage the continuum of aggregates alone and nothing else?," it is because [a self] cannot be directly perceived nor can it be inferred.

In reality, this purusha is called jñā, the knower, no different than the citta you describe.

The second account you gave, where everything is included in one eternal citta, is just the sat cit ānanda of Advaita.

Man, brutal. You just insulted someone that was widely considered an Arahant in Thailand based on your interpretation of a Sutta. The Citta as described in the Thai forest tradition is not a consciousness, therefore this sutta is rendered useless in an argument against it. Ajahn Martin specifically says consciousness is a part of the khandas and not eternal. The eternal Citta is independent of the khandas

From Ajahn Pannavaddhos biography uncommon wisdom - Consciousness is necessary to experience the duality of subject
and object, but it is completely extraneous and unnecessary to the
original citta. So from the point of view of the reality of the knowingness
which is the true citta, consciousness is superfluous because the
true knowing is always present in the citta, even after all the physical
and mental aggregates have disappeared.

So here you see he is referring to consciousness and the citta as two different things. Further proof the sutta is irrelevant to it. Ajahn Maha Bua was a scholar before he became a hardcore meditator under Ajahn Mun. Don't you think he knows what the pali canon says? And Ajahn Thanissaro is a follower of Ajahn Maha Bua's eternal citta. And Ajahn Thanissaro is responsible for a lot of the suttas translations into english, maybe even including the one you sent me!
Luangta Maha Bua called the citta the eternal tourist who goes from life to life. In this case, it is the conventional citta. It would not be wrong to call it a soul or to speak of souls.

As for the Madhyamaka view you're referencing here it's a wholly separate issue, but I would say that an analysis that dissolves the difference between cause and effect seems to me to be at the very least the beginnings of establishing a view from the ultimate side.

Malcolm wrote:
Nāgārjuna begins the MMK with this famous verse:
At no time and no where 
does anything arise
from itself, from other, 
from both or without a cause.
Nāgārjuna's presentation does not dissolve the difference between cause and effect, it states that one cannot coherently designate causes and effects as being either the same or different without the following flaws.

For example, the Samkhya school maintains that effects are present in their causes, violating Nāgārjuna first maxim, "no arising from itself"; the Vaiśeṣika school maintains that causes and results are utterly distinct, violating Nāgārjuna;s second maxim, "no arising from other." The third maxim, "no arising from both" is present merely for formal completeness — I know of no Indian school that proposes both.

The consequence of the first assertion is that arising is unnecessary and there is can only be homogenous reproduction of the series[ thus proposing that existents arise from existents].  The consequence of the second assertion is that there is arising of an existent result from a cause that has already temporally perished, [thus proposing that existents arise from nonexistents.] The consequence of the third assertion involves the faults of the first two assertions.

Nāgārjuna, and all subsequent Madhyamikas, maintain conventionally that causes are neither the same nor different form their effects in order to account for causal continuity without invoking either identity or discontinuity, thus Nāgārjuna's fourth maxim, "There is no arising without a cause," is never violated at any time.

Of course, later, Nāgārjuna shows that ultimately arising is impossible:
An existent does not arise from existent, 
an existent does not arise from a nonexistent, 
an nonexistent does not arise from an existent,
a nonexistent does not arise from a nonexistent —
where then is there arising?

Although i dont know how chan/zen was taught or practiced in Hashang's time, i would definitely say this is true today. I remember reading ChNN's small book called "Dzogchen and Zen" and thinking that it did not correspond at all to how the practice was done at SFZC. Then, many years later, I heard ChNN speak of Suzuki-roshi as a vajrayana teacher.

I never met Suzuki-roshi so I don't know how he taught but I have heard some of his students say that Suzuki-roshi himself described his teaching as "Hinayana teaching with Mahayana spirit". Certainly, the precision of the forms was very Hinayana-like. And perhaps the Mahayana aspect goes without saying.

Then, a few years ago, one of Suzuki-roshi main lineage holders, Mel Weitzman, said that Suzuki-roshi had not taught them some of the more advanced practices in the lineage (at least thats how I understood what I heard him say). So there does seem to be an evolution of sorts happening in zen teaching in america. And of course, I am speaking of only one lineage in a vast and complicated school.

Honestly, I don't concern myself too much with what I consider to be ancient history (although I know that for some it is important and indeed can be a life's work). Nevertheless, I very much value what zen taught me, especially the form aspect.

It is an interesting term. If you examine the context of the term, the way it is used in Tibetan, you will swiftly see that "total state of being" does not work well.

In Dzogchen, the term bdag nyid chen po and bdag nyid accompanies the terms ngang and rang bzhin. This true in both Buddhist and Bon texts.

For example, in the Zhang Zhung sNyan rGyud, we find:
State [ngang], nature [rang bzhin] and identity [bdag nyid] are a trio.
The state is the total clarity of rig pa. 
The nature is the total emptiness of rig pa. 
The identity is the nonduality of clarity and emptiness.
Everything is understood as pure consummate mind [byang chub sems]
through the axiom of total identity [bdag nyid chen po].
I have many similar examples from Buddhist texts. So here, I would prefer to render this term as "total identity."

...but not if you're a Shentongpa like Dudjom R. And, in fact, that was the specific point that Kongtrul was addressing and refuting by talking about the "ground" in terms where there are no buddhas and no sentient beings--no minds whatsoever.

Malcolm wrote:
As I said, Dudjom, Kongtrul and I do not disagree. We understand these texts. But you do not, and so you are perpetually confused as to what they mean because you just read the words without understanding the meaning and so you imagine contradictions where in fact none exist.

And you keep on attributing a dimension of time to a state where there is no time. Dzogchen texts talk about the fourth time. That is the time of the basis, i.e. no past, present, future. Hence use of the terms like original, primordial, and so on. The basis is one's own unfabricated mind —— it is not a buddha, it is not a sentient being, it is beyond time, beyond extremes, beyond expression, it has never been liberated because it has never experienced a state of bondage and so on. Accumulating merit and wisdom will not liberate it; engaging in the five heinous misdeeds [harming a buddha, killing an arhat, etc.] will not place it in bondage. There is nothing you can to improve it, nothing you can do will harm it. It is empty, clear and inseparable. Relatively, when it is not recognized, it is called "the basis appears as the universe." At the time it is recognized, it is called "The universe arises as the basis." The basis is the basis, it is the path and it is the result. There is no buddhahood to find outside of the basis, likewise, there is no buddhahood to find outside of one's own unfabricated mind. One'w unfabricated mind is buddhahood. There is no other buddhahood to realize. Everything is complete within that unfabricated mind, all of samsara and nirvana is complete there. And there are also no phenomena of either samsara or nirvana at all present in the basis.



So obviously Kongtrul has a different take on it. You may disagree, as is your right, but if you push it you're basically calling him a tirthika.[/quote]

It does not. In fact, all of this display of samsara and nirvana arise because the basis is not recognized for what it actually is. But there is not even the slightly iota of phenomena within the basis itself.

Anyway, the basis is just a word for one's own unfabricated mind. The generic basis is just a description of that unfabricated mind's characteristics, i.e. emptiness, clarity and their inseparability.

No, actually it is specifically and deliberately being presented as a "ground of being". "Myriad Worlds" is about the various cosmologies, starting with Mr Meru and such. The only subject matter the book addresses is buddhist paradigms of how the universe is. It ends with a Dzogchen cosmology, which is unambiguously a "ground of being". Excluding the presence of either buddhas or sentient beings makes that clear.

Hey, you don't have to buy it. Plenty of people have become enlightened that find such ideas heresy. But plenty of people, such as Kongtrul himself presumably, have become enlightened while holding those types of ideas. So either way is fine. It is a matter of preference.

Malcolm wrote:
No, SMCJ, the term in Tibetan is simple gzhi, basis. There is no connotation of being presented by use of the term gzhi. In fact the gzhi, the basis is devoid of any extreme of existence, nonexistence and so on. The basis is ka dag, originally pure, i.e. empty, as Master Vimalamitra states:
The basis, the state of initial original purity, is liberated
because its essence is not established at all.
"Ground of being" is a term coined by the theologian Paul Tillich to describe God. The basis is not a creative force like God. It does not generate anything. Nothing arises from the basis, and nothing returns to the basis. The Six Dimension offers some clarity:
Dharmatā free from proliferation is originally pure;
it is the basis of an intrinsically pure nature;
it is free from words and syllables;
it cannot be confirmed through expression;
it is free from all conventional reification;
it is without concepts of apprehended objects and apprehending
subjects;
it is without buddhas and without sentient beings;
it is without phenomena and without perception of phenomena;
no one, no thing, nothing at all.
When the essence of such nonexistence
is confirmed with some words:
the essence is original purity
and the nature is natural perfection.

Hi Malcolm. Yes, understood, from the ultimate level.

But at issue with the Ajahn was his account of rebirth from what I would consider the conventional level, and my point was that his kind of reasoning was overly simple for the kind of learners he's likely to be confronted with. Lacking the resources of the Mahayana, let alone the Madhyamaka, it would seem to me better to at least be consistent with the notion of identity, and even better to bracket the whole area of the conventional self for which he can give no satisfactory answers.

(1) by his definition the Buddha was an eternalist because the Buddha taught the 4 virtues of Nirvana(permanence,bliss,self,purity) in the Buddha Nature Sutra's.

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddha also taught that nirvana was not permanent and not impermanent and so on in other sūtras, still in others he taught nirvana was cessation, etc.

The point is that one cannot always take what the Buddha says in the sūtras literally.

One has to discern what is definitive and what is provisional. As far as the Tathāgatagarbha sutras go, there are two ways to understand them: a provisional way which causes one to be a kind of eternalist; and a definitive way which is free from the fault of the provisional approach and has no taint of attachment to dualities such as permanent, impermanent and so on.

Of course you will respond with the three turnings of the wheel interpretive scheme, but I have already shown elsewhere in detail that the Tibetan use of this schema finds no support at all in Indian literature, especially not with Maitreyanatha, Asanga, etc., and is in fact is the system of a Korean master who commented at length on the Samdhinirmocana-sūtra, whose commentary exists in the Tibetan canon and was very influential.

Vimalakirti432 said:
As an example let's look at a talk on rebirth by Ajahn Brahmali, which is available on YouTube. This is not to rag on the Ajahn, who overall gave a good presentation for learners. But in his attempt to cut off clinging to self he used the identity argument in such a way as to illustrate what I've been saying.

In short, he argued for the absolute discontinuity of consciousness, from one thought moment to the next, and so the incoherence of a continuous identity. Of course this just begged the question(s). As one young woman in the room asked, What thought moment is it that is cognizing this absolute discontinuity? His answer was evasive and weak, suggesting some kind of inference.

And even a moment's reflection reveals that yes I'm not the same as I was a moment ago, but I'm also not different. (And isn't this very same point made in the Surangama sutra, if memory serves?) But there's a more serious objection yet.

The doctrine of rebirth depends for its coherence on some notion of identity, as Bhikku Bodhi points out without controversy I think in his article on rebirth (again available online). So we have this peculiar consequence that we poor benighted sentient beings are only granted identity at the point of rebirth but not in our actual lives!

Malcolm wrote:
The Madhyamaka point of view is that causes and effects are neither the same nor are they different, thus avoiding all contradictions between absence of identity and continuity. Therefore, there is no need for the doctrine of rebirth to hinge on any kind of identity proposition in order for someone to maintain continuity in a series.

Can you give me some references to Zen teachers completely forthright about the true self/atman/soul just like straight in your face " THE ETERNAL UNCHANGING SOUL SEPARATE FROM THE FIVE KHANDAS EXISTING OUTSIDE OF TIME AND SPACE COMPLETELY INDESTRUCTIBLE A MYSTERY BEYOND CONCEPTS THE ETERNAL KNOWER FIVE HUNDRED MEN WITH SPEARS CAN'T TOUCH IT AHHHH" It's hard for me to find just straight teachings on this thing. Like even on the Jonang website there's barely anything.

seeker242 said:
The Lankavatara Sutra, a very popular zen sutra, talks a lot about this sort of thing. But you really don't ever get a "completely forthright" description of it. But that's not a failure of the teachings, it's a failure of the nature of words and concepts to begin with.
Then Mahamati said: Again, Bhagavan, are words themselves the
highest reality? or is what is expressed in words the highest reality?

The Bhagavan replied: Mahamati, words are not the highest reality, nor
is what is expressed in words the highest reality. Why? Because the
highest reality is an exalted state of bliss, and as it cannot be entered
into by mere statements regarding it, words are not the highest reality.
Mahamati, the highest reality is to be attained by the inner realization of
noble wisdom; it is not a state of word-discrimination; therefore,
discrimination does not express the highest reality. And then, Mahamati,
words are subject to birth and destruction; they are unsteady, mutually
conditioning, and are produced by the law of causation. And again,
Mahamati, what is mutually conditioning and produced by the law of
causation cannot express the highest reality, because the indications
[pointing to the distinction between] self and not-self are non-existent.
Mahamati, words are these indications and do not express [the highest
reality].
One's true self is "unconditioned" and therefore cannot be accurately described by the conditioned.
That which is unconditioned goes beyond all idle reasonings. That which goes beyond
all idle reasonings, that is the Tathagata. Mahamati, this is the essence of
perfect enlightenment, this is the self-nature of Buddhahood which is
removed from all senses and measurements. So it is said:

79. That which is released from senses and measurements is neither an
effect nor a cause; it has nothing to do with knowledge and that which is
to be known; it is free from predicated and predicating.

80. There is something which is nowhere to be seen by anybody as the
Skandhas, causation, enlightenment; of that which is nowhere to be seen
by anybody, what description can we make?

81. It is not something made nor unmade, it is neither an effect nor a
cause, it is neither the Skandhas nor not-Skandhas, nor is it other than
the combination.

82. There is something that is not to be seen by the discrimination of its
being, nor is it to be known as nonexistent; such is the self-essence of all
things.
The Lankavatara Sutra is one of my favorites. Although, not exactly "completely forthright" in a sense. Although, depending on how you look at it, one could say it's about as completely forthright as you can get!

asunthatneversets said:
Do you think confusion about this arises due to the fact that "rig pa" as a Tibetan term can also mean plain old, everyday "knowing"? I've seen some teachers use it in that context, such as when the relative knowing of mind as gnas gyu shes pa is referred to as rig pa in the context of gnas gyu rig gsum. This seems to create confusion and lends to the misconception that rig pa is always present.

For instance, Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche uses rig pa like that, but then makes a point to differentiate two different types of rig pa, which strikes me as a plausible example of how so much confusion arises over this principle.

In the case of stillness [gnas pa], occurrence [gyu ba] and noticing [rig pa], the word rigpa is used for noticing. Self-existing awareness [rang byung rig pa] is also called rigpa. The word is the same but the meaning is different. The difference between these two practices is as vast as the distance between sky and earth.

The 47the chapter of the All-Creating King Tantra states:
Because the Great Perfection has always been beyond cause and result,
there is nothing to do and nothing to accomplish with seeking and practicing.
Having set the scriptures taught by the teachers of the view of cause [sentient beings] and result [buddhas]
as standards for the phenomena of worldly characteristics,
a result to accomplished is sought from a cause. 
Without a cause in the mind there has never been a result
because there is no arising in awakened mind [bodhicitta]. 
Having used an example for worldly arising phenomena, 
perishing after arising cannot be termed production.
Since the self-originated beyond cause and result cannot be examined,
having set the standard for the phenomena of worldly characteristics,
it claimed that a result is produced that is sought from a cause,
that is the provisional scripture of the vehicles of cause and result.

Now I'm having a confuse, because it also says that ngondro isn't necessary to participate in this teaching... which is a no-brainer if it's a ngondro teaching.

It's the four thoughts that turn the mind; it's the accumulations of prostrations and so on; and then there are specific practices associated with certain Dzogchen transmissions that are also called "ngondro."  If the subsequent teachings are in 2016, is there some expectation of one doing a lot of accumulation before parts two and three, or...?

I also don't know what Nyoshi means.

It just means that in some of his A khrid teachings, you should have attended section one. Here, no need since it is the preliminary section.

Malcolm wrote:
It is probably the A Khrid in fifteen sections — about 36 western pages. There are other instructions, the fifteen section A khrid in the version I have amounts to about 165 pages of instructions. There is also another earlier manual divided into eight or ten sections. It is about 135 pages all totaled.

I imagine, though I could not tell you for sure, that is is three sections divided by five sections. It has the usual subjects like confidence in the guru, bodhicitta, refuge and confession, mandala, supplication to the guru, etc.

So I imagine that first retreat focuses mainly on Ngondro, the second and third retreats focus mainly nature of mind, etc.

There is a kind of literature called sa dpyad, literally, "site analysis" that gives various indications and sometimes even diagrams like the following: mountain_types.jpg (15.07 KiB) Viewed 4047 times
This illustration, from left to right, shows mountains according to elemental typology: wood [ཤིང], fire [མེ], metal [ལྕགས] and water [ཆུ].

It is generally held that the science of sa dbyad comes from China. The above illustration is from a text from is called The Treasury of Jewels, Chinese Site Analysis [rgya nag dpyad nor bu'i gter mdzod]. There are also site examination texts from India, having to do with mandala construction, as well as the subject of Vastu śastra.

The dual influences of Chinese and Indian culture on these issues is demonstrated by Karma Chagme's short text on this subject. We can see here too Tibetan pre-Buddhist ideas about ancestors and so on in the way the term bla is used in this specific context. The first chapter of Karma Chagme's text states:
The accurate result of the relative site:
in general, all of the outer universe and inhabitants
have the nature of the five elements. 
India, China, Mongolia and Tibet
are based on the way earth element has formed. 

The chronicle of happiness, suffering, 
increase and decrease, wealth and poverty
is clarified in the site examination texts of Kīlaya. 
Therefore, this location of the living, 
such as location of the house and so on, is important. 

Life [srog], the soul [bla] and consciousness [rnam shes] are a trio. 
Life is taken by the ghostly butcher.
Consciousness is the slave of karma.
Having taken the form of the past life, the soul
exists in the tomb site.  
If the tomb site is good, that soul prospers,
will protect and guard the living,
and is called "being guarded by the souls of the paternal ancestors."
If the tomb site is bad, that soul flounders,
and since it seeks protection in the living, 
the misfortune of unbearable illnesses arise. 
Therefore, the site of the tomb is important. 
It was said by Ārya Mañjusȓī
in the Tantras of the Divinatory Sciences of China,
"If the corpse is carried to a badly analyzed site,
even animals will be crushed into dust."
The text continues in the following chapter by listing various titles of Chinese and India site examination texts. Chapter three gives the general technique. Chapter four gives the techniques for picking a tomb site. Chapter five gives the specifics for picking a house site. Chapter six gives the specifics for selecting a site for practicing Chod.

FYI, the above text is a section of Karma Chagme's Mountain Dharma.

Much of this information about directions, shapes of the land and so on is to be found in elemental calculation, which is also part of the "Divinatory Sciences of China."

Malcolm, what about the time you quoted Rongzom saying first dhyana is necessary for Dzogchen practitioners?

Malcolm wrote:
What I said was that Rongzom maintains that if one has not understood the meaning of Dzogchen directly, one should meditate either sūtra or tantra style [without a bias towards either, incidentally], cultivating these five mental factors that constitute the first dhyan̄a, trying to maintain total attention [shes bzhin, saṃprajāna ] within the horizon of complete mindfulness [ dran pa, smṛtiḥ ]. Thus, for many of us, developing this dhyāna is important to the degree that it assists us maintain the view. These two words, smṛtiḥ and saṃprajāna, incidentally, as the words ChNN is translating using "presence and awareness."

This is one of the things I wonder about- does this mean that attentional stability is optional for dzogchen? (actually seems plausible to me for certain individuals), or (more plausible to me) that the attentional stability is a necessity but is developed in a variety of alternative contexts to what has been "officially" known as "shamatha"?  My suspicion is that it's the latter. (The story od Garab Dorje maintaining equipoise as the devatas blew horns in his ears, e.g.)

Straightforward shamatha has been an important part of my path and will continue to be, I can't undo my foundation, so I suppose this is just idle curiosity on my part...

Samadhi is innate, it is part of the 10 neutral mental factors all sentient beings possess.

You will often find in the Dzogchen tradition the idea of self-arisen concentration — this is a result of recognizing the basis [aka rig pa] and stabilizing that recognition through various practices as Ivo mentions.

Right, the characteristic of space is its total absence, which is why the element of space is defined as "non-obstruction." It and the two kinds of cessation, are the only kinds of uncompounded phenomena [dharma, lit. bearer of characteristics] there are. Everything else is compounded or conditioned.

When you begin to delve into higher Buddhist tenets, the metaphor of space becomes more important, since emptiness is linked to it. It is the basis and container of everything without being anything at all. Since it is the basis and container of everything, everything it supports isn't anything at all, like a magician's illusion.

Malcolm wrote:
Introduction is a path. Once you have received introduction from a qualified person, then you apply it yourself. The only qualification one needs is interest.

In Dzogchen, it is sufficient to have an inferential understanding of emptiness, for example, derived from the eight examples of illusion.

The path itself does not necessarily involve any analytical vipaśyāna at all. It involves working with the experience of the introduction itself.

Dzogchen is not a path based on causes and results, as difficult as that is for many people to accept.

At this moment, you are free from all fixed notions of what mind might be, and liberation itself is actualized: “There is nothing there: transfixed in wonder,”

Malcolm wrote:
Patrul Rinpoche states:
First is the method of introducing the view that has not yet been revealed. Generally speaking, there are many ways of bringing the view to realization. In the sūtrayāna path of dialectics the method of lung rig [scripture and reasoning* MS] is employed; that is, using the scriptural authority of the teaching of Buddha and the great masters, and through logic and reasoning, arriving at the realization of the view.

According to the common approach of Secret Mantrayāna, by means of the wisdom of example in the third empowerment, one is introduced to the real, ultimate wisdom in the fourth empowerment. 

Here, according to the special approach of the great masters of the practice lineage, the nature of mind, the face of rigpa, is introduced in and upon the very dissolution of conceptual mind.
Neither of the two latter methods require analysis, as I said, "Anyway, such analysis is not necessary in Dzogchen practice, not in any sense at all."
The crucial point here is that rigpa, which abides as the ground of dharmakāya, is the primordial purity of the path of the yogins, the absolute view of freedom from all elaboration. Until you recognize this one point, then whatever meditation or practice you do, you can never get beyond a fabricated mind-made view and meditation. The difference between this and the approach of the natural Dzogpachenpo is greater than that between earth and sky, as it does not possess the essential point—the unceasing flow of clear light, which is non-meditation. So it is most important, first of all, to recognize this and this alone, and: “Recognize this as the pure awareness of dharmakāya”.
I don't know why you bother citing Patrul Rinpoche, as he merely illustrates my point.

However, as shown in my previous collection of clarifying quotes, meditation is about direct perception, and through vipasyana  that is what is achieved. The zealous stage is about aspiring to that direct experience, it is the time of practice on the basis of the instructions, required before realisation is attained.

The text continues in the section on zealous conduct:

"But when one would ascertain the non-dual knowledge which is devoid of the forms of the object and subject, then this is the degree of penetration designated "The best (worldly) condition" (agradharma). And this is called "The samadhi without interval" because, in fact, immediately following it one enters into suchness."

"Thus, through this progress, a yogi should meditate on suchness for an hour, or half a session in the night, or one full session, or for as long as is comfortable. This is the meditative stabilization thoroughly discerning the ultimate, as taught in the Descent into Lanka Sutra."

It is on suchness, not some image of suchness. And that's what is in the text in every place, directly seeing suchness, not simply an image or concept of it.

The quote provided in my previous post states: "apprehends the selfless nature of all phenomena", and that's the very result of the vipasyana. It would be quite pointless to achieve simply a generic concept, since for that there is no need to perform any meditation.

By realising that, the very identity which is established as the aspect of the mind, like the identity of physical form, etc., is also not ultimately perceived. In this way, when a person does not ultimately see the identity of all phenomena through wisdom he would not analyse whether physical form is permanent or impermanent, empty or not empty, contaminated or non-contaminated, produced or non-produced and existent or non-existent.
Just as physical form is not examined, similarly feeling, recognition, compositional factors and consciousness are not examined. When the object does not exist, its particularities also cannot exist. So how can they be examined? In this way when the person does not firmly grasp on to the entity of a thing as ultimately existing, having investigated with wisdom, then the practitioner engages in a non-conceptual single-pointed concentration. And thus identitylessness of a11 phenomena is also realised."

"In this way one who has entered in the suchness of the selflessness of person and phenomena is free from concept and analysis because there is nothing to be thoroughly examined and observed. One is free from expression and with one-pointed mental engagement one automatically enters in meditation without manifest discrimination. Thus one very clearly meditates on suchness and abides in it."

"If and when the mind is spontaneously engaging in meditative equipoise on suchness free of sinking and mental agitation, at that time it should be left naturally and the efforts relaxed."

Malcolm wrote:
First Kamashila sets forth his objective. Then he describes the means he wants to use to get there. A realized bodhisattva has no need for the following: ""If and when the mind is spontaneously engaging in meditative equipoise on suchness free of sinking and mental agitation, at that time it should be left naturally and the efforts relaxed."

This suchness is a generic image of suchness, it is not real suchness.

Many people do not have this idea. They meet Buddhadharma and then spend lots of time refuting a self they never believed existed to begin with.

Malcolm wrote:
The general idea of self includes that it remains the same from one day to another. What not many people have is a more sophisticated soul/atman view.
Many commoners do not really have this idea — first they have to be brainwashed into refuting a self most of them will readily agree they do not have, unless they have a belief in a soul. Many atheists are quite happy they have no soul, and if you tell them their "self" is a cognitive imputation, they happily go along with this idea.

Umm, no.

Malcolm wrote:
How so? That something is only a conventionally agreed name means that it has no basis beyond the concept.
That is not merely what conventional means. For example, according to one famous presentation of Madhyamaka, things are not non-existent in the relative. The term vyavahāra has come to mean a mere designation in some Buddhist circles, but even here, there are levels of vyavahāra, holding that this or that is vyavahāra does not mean that one is not also a realist. For example, "water" is vyavahāra, but its qualities of limpidity and wetness are parāmartha dharmas according to Sautrantikas. For example, according to one famous presentation of Madhyamaka, we cannot say a car is nonexistent, even though it is conventional, we can only say that there is no inherent car in a car, not that there is no car in that which is conventionally termed "a car" because such a thing has been designated on the basis of its parts. Why? Because that which is conventionally designated a car functions as a car, and hence it is car. According to this specific brand of Madhyamaka, a car has a basis beyond its concept, its parts. One cannot designate a bunch of sticks and leaves a car and expect to drive anywhere.

Well not all of them, not everywhere, but those Sherpas certainly are if you happen to find yourself climbing above 25,000 feet.

Recent genetic studies are looking at the mutations that allow Sherpas and other Tibetans to tolerate altitude easily, The weird part is one of the mutations causes Sherpas to make FEWER red blood cells. When a Westerner without the mutation is progressively exposed to higher altitudes, we make more blood cells to compensate. This process gets more and more extreme the higher we go, until in the death zone, we run into problems with blood viscosity which lead to High Altitude Pulmonary Edema and High Altitude Cerebral Edema, both life-threatening conditions.

Now the Sherpas don't do that. They make a pretty normal number of blood cells and avoid many problems, thanks to a mutation that seems to be less than 10,000 years old.

Another mutation looks like it is involved with oxygen metabolism. Maybe they don't pile up lactic acid via anaerobic metabolism to the extent we do. Maybe they can scavenge oxygen out of the blood stream better. No one knows yet but its an area of active research. This one is an older mutation.


There are quite a number of mutations that occur with roughly a 90% frequency among Tibetans, and some of them run as low a 1% frequency among Han Chinese. I find it really intriguing that we are so close to understanding the hows and whys of it all. A significant possibility is that it may be possible to develop an injection that will turn you into a Sherpa for a while.

How effective are these mutations? A few years back there was a massive problem on K2 and people were dropping like flies. If you enter the death zone, normally you have about 48 hours to get down before you become nonfunctional. That's a death sentence at altitude. A fellow name Pemba Gyalje Sherpa (sp?) began rescue operations, and by the time he was done he had spent 90 continuous hours in the death zone. Basket case right? Nope, when he was done he just hiked off the mountain. He was fine.

Of course it might be entirely due to Buddhist mental discipline and the help of Tara but somehow I don't think so...

Now while I do have a strong streak of rationalism - as do you, my new dharma buddy, the Venerable Malcolm - that's not my fundamental mental disposition - which is more properly labeled "pantheistic". For as long as I can remember I have had that well-attested sense of the aliveness of things, of trees and rocks as well as sentient beings, and no not just on sunny days. Of course this kind of feeling is tucked into or appropriated by most religious traditions where one can find its warrant. In the Gospel of Thomas, for example, where we find Jesus saying, "The kingdom of God is spread upon the Earth but men do not see it", and of course in many Zen sayings and Zen inspired poetry.

Now someone with this disposition may point to this and call it God or Brahmin and, while not necessarily being in error, may be adding a head to the one that's already there. That's why I've always been drawn to Buddhist dependent origination and the middle way as perhaps a more accurate and direct approach.

Of course I only speak for myself, but one with this disposition may experience, by moments at least, objects and beings, including one's own person, as a kind of transparency, as being particular instances of one energy, but a single energy that cannot be reified into some kind of literal "one".

Now just to be precise, I'm not calling myself a "pantheist"; I'm only copping to that disposition, and like all mental dispositions it's only the beginning to much that needs to be worked out and developed.

I could babble on of course, and  you know already what a terrible blabbermouth I am, but all this is to explain why I find it so weird to be called a "materialist", just because I find no evidence for or need to believe in particular theories about the nature of consciousness.

So you see I may well be an idiot, and maybe just as annoying as any other, but I thought it was of use to at least point out precisely what kind of idiot I am.

There is only one stream of momentary consciousness. It functions through the six sense organs like a monkey jumping from one window to the next. For example, when it functions through the eye, it is called "eye consciousness", when it jumps to the ear, it is called "ear-consciousness." But one does not possess multiple consciousnesses at the same time. To propose that one does contradicts the basic definition of vijñāna-skandha.
No, there was no mention of multiple consciousnesses at the same time. However, the mind-stream does not affirm a single consciousness either, rather a series of many. The monkey's simile means that consciousness occurs where the hand and the branch makes contact, but there is no monkey going from one place to another. As the sutta explains: "what's called 'mind,' 'intellect,' or 'consciousness' by day and by night arises as one thing and ceases as another" ( SN 12.61 ), and in another speech: "Consciousness, monks, is classified simply by the requisite condition in dependence on which it arises. ... Just as fire is classified simply by whatever requisite condition in dependence on which it burns" ( MN 38 ).

Since it functions in a serial stream, we can call it one thing for the purpose of conversation, just as we can refer to the collection of aggregates as a self, for the purpose of conversation. It does not mean that there is a unitary Astus in your aggregates.

In the contrary, Madhyamakas also take this stance, as Nāgārjuna states; "If I had a position, I would be at fault; since I alone have no position, I alone am without fault."

And lest you think the critique is only aimed at sūtra, Rongzom continues:
Since the system of Secret Mantra asserts the two truths to be inseparable, homogeneity is established.At that time there is no difference between homogeneity, non-arising, naturelessness, emptiness and selflessness. Nevertheless, due to anxiety about not being able to practice uniform behavior and not being able to remove that anxiety quickly, for that purpose they undertake ascetic hardships.

And as I pointed out, published books about tantric rites are much more fraught with potential for abuse.

Ignorance is already present, no need to establish it, only to point it out as the source of the problems.

Malcolm wrote:
We all understand ignorance is the source of the problem. The question is how to deal with it.

Astus said:
No, really it is much simpler than that. They need to receive direct introduction — then they need to work with the instructions of the lineage, which in general do not involve any analysis whatsoever, at least in Dzogchen.
Same happens everywhere else. One learns the teaching, understands it, then applies it. Analysis is following the guidance of the teachings to confirm for oneself its validity, like checking if there's a self in the sensory areas.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, and as pointed out above, it is a very slow approach because it relies on a coarse mind.


Astus said:
If all perceptions are inconstant and reliable, than all analysis is unreliable.
Yes, even the teachings are empty, conventional and conditioned. If there were a teaching of the ultimate nature, then it would really contradict universal emptiness.

Malcolm wrote:
So you admit that all analysis is unreliable.


Astus said:
Analysis is using the teachings to do an investigation. So when it talks about checking if there is any permanent element within the physical area, it's not just theorising whether that is the case or not, but looking at one's own present experience. This is what I have said before and say now.

Malcolm wrote:
Well then, it is pretty clear your notion of impermanence is merely an imputation, because there are plenty of counterfactual experiences of permanence.



Astus said:
No one is positing an ultimate perceiver here — the point there are not six consciousnesses apprehending six different kinds of media. There is one consciousness functioning through the six sense organs. The point is that when one understands that the magician is not real, one immediately understands that his tricks are also false. Going through and analyzing the six external sense objects is a waste of time.
There are a number of problems with positing a single consciousness, as taught from the early texts on in the context of the 18 dhatus. Actually, that's what one should recognise during analysis, that the mind is not a single entity but a series of instances, and then one can go further to see that even instances are not graspable as distinct entities. That's how the emptiness of both self and dharmas are confirmed. Looking for that single perceiver is no different from looking for the self and not finding it anywhere.

Malcolm wrote:
There is only one stream of momentary consciousness. It functions through the six sense organs like a monkey jumping from one window to the next. For example, when it functions through the eye, it is called "eye consciousness", when it jumps to the ear, it is called "ear-consciousness." But one does not possess multiple consciousnesses at the same time. To propose that one does contradicts the basic definition of vijñāna-skandha.


Astus said:
Madhyamaka, in reality, merely serves as a corrective to the realism of the three lower tenet systems. It has no tenet system of its own. This is why Madhyamaka has not independent path which is separate from the path of Yogacara. The path of Yogcara and Madhyamaka is the same path, five paths and ten stages.
This interpretation of "corrective to the realism of the three lower tenet systems" makes sense only in the Tibetan system where only Vajrayana is viewed as something practical, while the so called sutra teachings are reduced to mere theory. Kamalashila does not seem to see that way, nor do other Madhyamikas. As for the path, why should it come up with a new one? It is a Mahayana teaching for bodhisattvas.

Malcolm wrote:
In the contrary, Madhyamakas also take this stance, as Nāgārjuna states; "If I had a position, I would be at fault; since I alone have no position, I alone am without fault."

Astus said:
The kinds of analysis Madhyamaka engages in is meant to serve as a corrective to realism.
If by realism you mean the basic grasping at supposedly real entities, then yes. If by that you mean only a theoretical view, then it is limiting the scope of the teachings for no good reason.

Malcolm wrote:
The problem with Madhyamaka is that it has a theoretical view: the two truths.

Astus said:
Saying that the nature of mind is "empty-clarity" does not really add anything. When it is said that the mind is empty, that's not the same as saying there is no mind. Since the mind is per definition aware, saying that its nature is empty is the same as saying that awareness is empty, but the awareness of it is not diminished by this at all. Similarly, saying that a ball is red doesn't mean it is not also round, since being a ball means that it is round.

Malcolm wrote:
Madhyamaka analysis does not address the nature of the mind; it merely rejects claims for existing existents and that is all.

The point I am making is that intellectual analysis will only result in an intellectual apprehension of the object of analysis. Even when you are finished with the analysis, for example, the famous diamond sliver analysis, and so on, still in the end you are left with the concept "emptiness", "nonarising", "freedom from extremes" and so on, even though, as Mañjuśrimitra points out, since the conceptualized extreme does not exist, therefore the extreme to analyze does not exist. Therefore, conventional analysis by mundane minds cannot used in an ultimate analysis because they cannot escape their own conceptual clinging, indeed they are always with concepts.

sherabpa said:
This is a standard objection to the mahayana analysis which is refuted by Shantideva in ch 9:

109
'But when the process of analysis
is in turn made an object of analysis
This too may be analyzed
And thus we find an infinite regress'.

110
If phenomena are truly analyzed
No basis for analysis remains.
Deprived of further objects, it has no basis
Which is called 'nirvana'.

This is standard stuff, you must know this.

Malcolm wrote:
Right, this is the Madhyamaka POV. Mañjuśrīmitra finds some fault with this line of reasoning for the reasons above.

sherabpa said:
The vajrayana was not taught because ultimate reality is inaccessible through the sutras.  That is a great denigration of the sutras.  Rather, it was taught because of the four superiorities.

Malcolm wrote:
I did not say that ultimate reality was inaccessible through sūtra, I pointed out that in the beginning that the kind of analysis that Astus now deems necessary, with his new-found enthusiasm for the Bhāvanakrama, is not necessary, and various faults to be had with such an analytical approach.

We can create a culture of respect for the teachings without having to enforce restrictions on classic texts.

For example, when the Bonpos published some instructions on Thogal, ChNN told everyone they should not read the thogal sections of that book. He did not say they should not buy it, etc. I think by and large everyone obeyed his request — I know I did.

I think it is much more strange that books on all the procedures of doing Kilaya practice are openly published for anyone to read, and no one says boo about those books, but when it comes to Dzogchen, everyone freaks out a little.

In the Ārya-mahāmokṣadiśunpuṣyakrokramtyapāpaṃśodhana-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra, and any number of Indian commentaries, both sutric, and especially tantric, there is a discussion three obscurations.

When we become a first stage bodhisattva we are liberated from samsara in the sense that now our Buddhahood is guaranteed. Even during patience on the path of application we are guaranteed not to take rebirth in the three lower realms and so on.

At the eighth stage, since we are free from afflictive obscurations, we now have power over birth, but this does mean we are free from the knowledge obscuration of ignorance.

Loppon-la,

You know I respect your opinion, but I don't agree with the following:

"the cat is out of the bag anyway, so we might as well do our best to present the best possible translations available to the widest number of people so they can encounter the teachings"

Rather I think we should do a better job of explaining and popularizing the notion that proper transmission of Dzogchen requires wang/ngo-tro, lung, and tri and that, if any are missing, the process doesn't work. This includes doing a better job of explaining that "the process" is supra-conceptual and is not a matter of intellectual understanding.

Malcolm wrote:
I can understand why you feel that way. Of course, I agree with you that Dzogchen needs to transmitted in a proper way, but Dzogchen teachings are not secrets to be kept as if they were classified information. At this point in time, people who do not read Tibetan are at a severe disadvantage, even if they have transmission. So for this reason, it is necessary to openly publish the classics, because in fact, all the raw information is out there already anyway; both in academia and in popular books available to the general public. Anyone can buy Alan Wallace's publication of Dudjom Lingpa's Dzogchen collection. Anyone can by Yeshe Lama on Amazon. These are but two examples. The cat is out of the bag, and we ought to acknowledge this fact. Anyone can get Germano's thesis, etc.

pemachophel said:
IMO, popularizing the Dzogchen texts even more widely and openly will only result in those teachings losing more and more of their power.

Malcolm wrote:
The predictions in the sgra thal 'gyur tantra concerning the spread of Dzogchen teachings throughout this world indicate that it is the last teaching to remain in this world before the teachings completely disappear. It is similar to the principle that at first the hells disappear, and then each realm above it, until all that remains is the upper form realms. Likewise, in this world system, first the worldly systems will disappear, the lower yānas, than the outer tantras, than the two lower inner tantras, and in the end, the only teaching which will remain is the Dzogchen teaching. Of course, Dzogchen was also the first teaching ever to be taught in this eon. All teachings spread from there.

So we should not be too worried about the teachings losing their power. Dzogchen is the essence of all of the teachings, it will never lose any of its power, ever, just like the sun and the moon will never lose their power to illuminate until this world system is destroyed completely.

Some of these same issues are covered from Sangye Khandro's POV in this recent interview: http://www.tricycle.com/blog/no-adaptation-required

Excerpt:
Have there been other problems in the transmission of the Vajrayana? Let me give you one example. An abbot—who works with my partner Lama Chonam and me—is coming to the United States soon to teach Dzogchen. He will give the empowerment, the reading transmission, and the instructions. But there will be restrictions on who can participate. It’s very important to him that no academic researchers be present unless they are there to actually practice. He is concerned about Westerners getting these transmissions, going back to their universities, and then teaching or publishing, out of context, what they were given. This is a problem in the West, and those of us who understand proper transmission need to speak out about it. It needs to stop.

And some who have no interest at all, but are in it for the intellectual exercise and cultural studies. My personal opinion from reading his papers and hearing him describe what he thinks Dzogchen means is that he has misunderstood key points, but I could say the same for a lot of faithful traditionalists as well. I also do not buy his speculative historical analysis of Dzogchen. But in this article I think Sangye is being a little over the top. Dzogchen teachings belong to humanity. And the cat is out of the bag anyway, so we might as well do our best to present the best possible translations available to the widest number of people so they can encounter the teachings. Frankly, invocations to Rahula are much more problematical as widely available texts than say the Rig pa rang shar tantra, IMO.

It should only be done after receiving direct introduction on the basis having the experience of a moment of ordinary mind.
Similarly to samatha, in vipasyana one goes from the grosser to the subtler objects, simply because that is normally easier. But eventually one arrives at investigating the mind to see that thoughts are inconstant and unreliable. A moment of mind without concepts becomes a memory in the next moment and then serves as just another concept, thus people can even imagine it to be a real self and set up a duality of thoughts versus no thoughts. Then they need to look again and integrate all experiences to see that all has the same nature as the mind. That way it becomes an analysis in the reverse order.

Astus said:
If the mind were not looked into it would be simply just samatha. Kamalashila arrives at the nature of mind as well:

"One analyses by thinking that just as the mind, the identity of all phenomena too is like mere illusion. In this way when the identity of the mind is individually examined by wisdom, in the ultimate sense it is perceived neither within or without. It is also not perceived in the absence of both. Neither the mind of the past, nor that of the future, nor of the present is perceived. When the mind is born, it comes from nowhere and when it ceases it goes nowhere because it is inapprehensible, undemonstratable and non-physical."

This is not the nature of the mind. The nature of the mind is not only emptiness. The result of this analysis epitomizes the fault the Kun byed rgyal po Tantra is pointing out to which exists in the sūtras of the bodhisattva pitika:

assert dharmatā as empty space

One should walk into a room, and discover what is there without first imagining "Oh! If there is a tiger there, I better go find out!"

What you are essentially recommending is going through a conceptual exercise of imagining that something is there, and then spending time to find out whether what you imagine is true.

If, on the other hand, someone tells you, "There are no tigers in that house", it may be the case that you have some doubt and need to confirm this for your self. Likewise, if someone tells you that there is no self in the aggregates, then you look and you will not find one. Of course it is up to you to look, and not leave it as a mere concept.


Astus said:
It is, providing you have ascertained there is no tiger. Otherwise, you can analyze whether there is or is not a tiger in a room until the end of time, without being one step closer to the truth. This is the problem with Madhyamaka analysis.
Again, as above, vipasyana is not theorising.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, the kind of vipaśyāna analysis you are now favoring is really, because unlike tigers and snakes, the absence of the four extremes is not something that really can be confirmed with ordinary thinking and cognitions because it is not an object. Therefore, you have to imagine something to negate and so on.

In other words, having seen a tiger, one can know what the absence of a tiger is because there are sign by which tigers can be apprehended. But there are no signs by which an extreme can be apprehended, and hence the analogy breaks down as it must.

Even if you think you have confirmed the absence of extremes, this is just an intellectual confirmation. In order to actually confirm this, you have to go beyond the conceptuality of the mind. Conceptual analysis will not get you there. Conceptual investigation will not get you there.

What you work with is the concepts themselves. They are your experiences.  So you observe them: where does this thought come from, where does it go?

Thus, there is no real need for analysis. One does not need to understand mere that there is no tiger in a house, one needs to understand that tigers, houses, snakes and indeed all phenomena are completely equivalent with illusions — this is the real intention of Mahāyāna.
The tiger is a metaphor for substance, the house for the six sensory areas. Realising that the six senses are insubstantial, illusory, is all there is to know. The way to realise that is observing clearly what the six senses actually are, that is, looking through the rooms, and that is analysis.

Malcolm wrote:
No, you merely need look at the perceiver who uses the six sense media, and understand it is not established in any way, mere empty clarity. You do not need analysis, you need direct introduction through experiences.

Since the kind of analysis used by Kamalashila and which are you now advocating involves coarse conceptuality, it is very difficult, virtually impossible through analysis to discover the nonconceptual empty clarity of the mind and go beyond mind. But when one works with direct introduction, it is very easy.

As for your inference that I'm a materialist I understand why you say that but I still have to disagree. As you suggest, the "natural" and the "super" are slippery and relative terms. I have no commitment to materialism but rather as I've said to collapsing a distinction rooted in primitive notions.

Ignorance is based on the mistaken concept of self. Removing that is wisdom. Knowledge of emptiness as a mere concept is not knowledge of emptiness. The conceptual knowledge of emptiness is when the concept of substance is proven to be false. Just like if one were to think that there is a tiger in the house then there would arise fear from entering it. But if one actually goes and checks the rooms and find no tiger, from the confirmed knowledge of that the fear vanishes.

Malcolm wrote:
Finding there is no tiger in the room is not a matter of analysis.

We might say that "there is no tiger in the house" is a conceptual knowledge, but what it means is that the idea of there being a tiger is removed, so in that sense it is relinquishing the concept.

It is, providing you have ascertained there is no tiger. Otherwise, you can analyze whether there is or is not a tiger in a room until the end of time, without being one step closer to the truth. This is the problem with Madhyamaka analysis.

Yes, so it is not a matter of analysis. It is a matter of direct perception.

Astus said:
Same goes for vipasyana, it is not merely theorising about there being a self or not but actually looking for it. Although it could be said that searching the house for a tiger is still based on delusion, without actually doing a thorough analysis, one will not just enter the house.

Malcolm wrote:
The difference is the following: when one is analyzing things like lions, tigers and bears, in reality these are mundane objects. Further, direct perceptions with mundane sense organs is not a priori veridical. You could very well see a rope as a snake an alley, in this case your [mistaken] direct perception is a snake, and as far as you are concerned, there must be a snake there. This shows the limitation of your analogy with ordinary sense organs.

Rongzom uses the example of the reflection of a black snake in the water to show the errors of various tenet systems. He explains:
[H]igher and lower views are solely differentiated on the basis more and less attachment to reality in appearances. 

For example, if there is reflection of a black snake in the water; some will see a snake, [48/a] and will leave due to their fear. Likewise, even though phenomena which are a source of suffering are like an illusion, they are abandoned by the śrāvakas who perceive them as real.

Even though some understand that  the black snake is a reflection, believing that it is harmful if touched, rely on medicine; likewise in the system of the Prajñāpāramita, even though the relative is like an illusion, since there is a view in which functional agents exist, one develops the pristine consciousness concerning the the knowable and relies upon the medicine of great compassion. 

Since some understand that the black snake is a reflection and will not cause harm even if touched, and are able to communicate to those with anxiety that its touch has no power. Likewise, in the systems of kriya and outer yoga tantra, even though it is comprehended there is no fault in lower conduct and substances, they do not have the capacity for intrepid behavior. But they have the capacity of the behavior to make offerings to deities, perform the conduct of strict discipline, accomplishment substances, etc. 

Some understand there is no fault in touching a black snake even if touching it has the ability to cause harm, because that anxiety is rapidly removed due to the existence of the strict discipline of subjugation.[49/a]  Likewise, the system of inner yoga "stands on the neck" of practice to quickly render all phenomena equal. One’s behavior specifically corresponds to the  strict discipline of the absence of virtue and misdeeds in phenomena and the absence of pure or impure in food. 

Since some, possessing an undeceived mind regarding the characteristic of a reflection of a black snake, see all of those behaviors as the behavior of children. Leaving aside the others, abandoning existents, etc.;, even the subjugation of that very reflection of a black snake like a heroic warrior is seen as a childish idea.  Accepting and rejecting, or a mind fabricating the condition of those does not develop, and moving and seeking do not occur. Likewise, since the system of the Great Perfection comprehends and is the culmination of the comprehension of all phenomena as totally equivalent to illusions, that being the case, the mind is not confused by the power of appearances and there is no ability of develop formations — there is no accepting, no rejecting, no moving and no seeking. As such, this culmination of the comprehension of being like an illusion is also proven to the culmination of comprehending the two truths as inseparable.
Thus, there is no real need for analysis. One does not need to understand mere that there is no tiger in a house, one needs to understand that tigers, houses, snakes and indeed all phenomena are completely equivalent with illusions — this is the real intention of Mahāyāna.

Here I'm talking about the dualistic notion of escaping out of life, of the otherworldliness we find from the beginning in the texts. The non-dual orientation of the Mahayana in theory should be the cure. Unfortunately the Mahayana has at the same time transformed the idea of escape into the unconditioned into a different kind of escape into supernatural notions of the Buddha and Buddha realms.

I've often been stuck by the essential strangeness of Mahayana sutras. They tend to begin with interesting core ideas, images, metaphors, etc. but then balloon out into mountains of repetition and hyperbole so that what starts out as a useful kind of poetry that supports one's practice finally becomes an alternate universe that substitutes a fairyland for the real.

In fact this happens almost literally. One of the debates in Tibetan Buddhism, for example, is whether a Buddha can have any mind at all, any thoughts or concepts, or whether she is a kind of robo-buddha, driven on by a previous bodhisattva career to help beings mindlessly. In this way a Buddha becomes so utterly, inhumanly transcendent that you need intermediaries to somehow connect with the human level, bodhisattvas like Avalokiteshvara, just as in theistic religions where an utterly transcendent God also demands intermediaries, Jesus in the Abrahamic line and Krishna in the line of Sanatana dharma, as examples.

Here's what I see. I think without much controversy I see the core of Buddhism as dependent origination.

Yes, this is the core of Buddhadharma. Score one for Vima!

Vimalakirti432 said:
From dependent origination all the other key ideas are derived - impermanence, the questioning of the nature of identity and so on, really the whole framework of the dhamma. And here, bare-bones as it seems, is the first phase of the cure for nihilism.

This first phase can be seen in many passages of the pali canon, where we read that certain of the Buddha's followers were immediately liberated, simply upon hearing about the principle of dependent origination. Initially this seems strange, at least to me, given the lack of explanation in the text. But on reflection I think we can fill in the blanks and assume that for some of his followers the intuition of dependent origination was enough, and that all its basic implications quickly followed.

Malcolm wrote:
Śariputra was already a follower of Saṃkhya, so of course dependent origination made sense to him immediately.

Vimalakirti432 said:
Here I locate the beginning of the second phase in the cure for nihilism, for here was an expansion of the practice that well before the Mahayana developed the sense of interrelatedness between beings, of their connectedness, so that even under the ideology of the arhats institutions were built that allowed people to see more clearly their inextricable network of relations, how the idea of a single isolated being was incoherent on the level of precious human birth, and that they were part of a larger whole, a spiritual community immune to annihilation. (Admirable friendships is not just half the spiritual life, it is the whole of the spiritual of life, says the Upaddha Sutta.)

Malcolm wrote:
Just as a personal self is incoherent, so is a social or communal self.

Vimalakirti432 said:
This development returns us to the problems of Buddhist realism, which are particularly acute in respect to the aggregates. The aggregates were wise and advanced medicine perhaps in the beginning, for the Buddha was known to say what was most skillful in the context of needs of the person he was facing. But by setting up separate categories for mind and body, i.e. dualism, the aggregates committed Buddhism to just the kind of habitual habits of mind that dependent origination in its deepest implications I believe overcomes.

Malcolm wrote:
The division of nāma and rūpa is ancient and pre-Buddhist. It is obvious that the mind is not the body. Lose a finger, your mind is not diminished one little bit. Lose your mind, your body immediately begins to decay and rot.

The point of the aggregates is merely to show there was no self in them or apart from them. The aggregates cover afflicted phenomena, whereas the āyatanas and dhātu cover both afflicted and nonafflicted  phenomena.

Vimalakirti432 said:
Ideas of the "material" and the "spiritual" are in fact habits of mind that go back in most cultures to very early human history, and arise as consequences of our particular evolution on our particular little planet we call home. Solid things hurt when they fall on our heads, and when the breath leaves the body and someone dies we feel that some switch has been turned off, that some substance has left. So understandably many of the first words for entities like "soul" also meant "breath" - "pneuma" in Greek, "prana" in Sanskrit, and so on. On the most primitive level, which like it or not, is still at the root of our mental habits, I believe it's as simple as that.

Malcolm wrote:
Prāṇa does not mean breath, it means life. There is a vāyu, a wind, called prāṇa-vāyu, the wind that sustains life.

Vimalakirti432 said:
Nagarjuna, by drawing out the full implications of dependent origination, breaks this primitive dichotomy down, shows that mind and body, emptiness and form, are not separate but an interdependent reality that resists all conceptualization and mental fabrication. A materialist denies spirit, an idealist denies matter, both in some sense toy with nihilism. Nagarjuna, by appearing to deny everything denies nothing. His middle way, as he maintains, is not nihilism but its cure (except for the hopelessly incurable who would posit emptiness as real).  His rigorous analysis definitively shows that dependent origination is indeed deep, subtle and hard to fathom.

Malcolm wrote:
Actually, Nāgārjuna points out that nothing is is established and that everything is a mere convention.

Vimalakirti432 said:
And so to sum up my liberal version of the dharma: when drawn out in its full implications, dependent origination is the definitive cure for nihilism and the fear of annihilation, in at least three phases: (phase 1)We are not separate and so have nothing to fear; (phase 2) we are not alone but interdependently involved with endless other beings; (phase 3)we are expressions of the non-dual fabric of things as they are, beyond all conception, perennially arising and re-arising, ever-renewing windows on reality.

Malcolm wrote:
We are also not the same. The idea of nonseparation is just another false identity proposition, refuted in opening praise of the MMK which is cited from the Prajñāpāramitā: i.e. not ceasing, not arising, not going, not coming, not annihilated, not permanent, not different, not identical, not the same... Thus, we are not interdependently involved with endless other beings, this is something Nāgārjuna rejects explicitly since he refutes the dominant condition among the four conditions [as well as the other three] in the first chapter of the MMK. There is no nondual fabric of things as they are, this is an entirely foreign notion to Buddhadharma. In Nāgārjuna's view, there is no ultimately no arising or ceasing. Arising and ceasing are merely conventions grounded in not seeing how things are.

Similarly, only hearing about emptiness without knowing what it means is just verbal information. Once it becomes clear what emptiness refers to in one's present experience, it is a confirmed conceptual knowledge. For example, one sees fire and knows that it is fire. If one sees fire without knowing what fire is, that has no power to inform one's knowledge (and therefore subsequent actions), while knowing fire without ever seeing one has no power to inform one's actions (as there is no use of that knowledge in any situation).

sees phenomena as evil.

nothing is seen.

Again, so-called higher perception [vipaśyāna] is seeing just how all phenomena are; seeing the reality of all phenomena; seeing that non-otherness of all phenomena; seeing the emptiness, seeing the signlessness, seeing the lack of aspiration of all phenomenal. Again, so-called higher perception [vipaśyāna] is not seeing with a cause, not seeing with out a cause, not seeing birth, perishing or abiding, not seeing an objective cause — also the best seeing is not seeing at all.
Or the Ārya-sāgara-nāgarāja-paripṛcchā-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:
In the same way, there is the higher perception [vipaśyāna] that all phenomena are without cause, without persistence, isolated, totally unestablished. As such, whatever is seen, that is the vipaśyāna of all phenomena. Therefore, if there is higher perception [vipaśyāna] regarding all phenomena, when someone sees a phenomena, it is not higher perception [vipaśyāna]. If it is asked why, seeing phenomena is not higher perception [vipaśyāna] because a cognition is not cognizant.

Since the mental factors of vitarka and vicara drop off above the first dhyāna, when one 's motivation is to engage in vipaśyāna, it is not appropriate to cultivate anything more than this.

I would suggest that as with most of the words we use we don't even know what we mean by "physical". We set up definitions in legitimate ways, in the natural sciences for example for pragmatic purposes, but also in what I consider illegitimate ways, in the interests of defending a certain metaphysical view or system.

Malcolm wrote:
I know precisely what I mean: "physical" [rūpena] refers to any entity that possesses hardness, heat, motility or liquidity in some degree or another. This covers everything on the periodic table of elements and all qualities they can possess or demonstrate, indeed it covers every type of physical phenomena, down to the smallest we can experimentally observe or even imagine, as well as the largest and everything in between.

Vimalakirti432 said:
Here we have what is called the hard problem of consciousness. To oppose the thesis that Dharmakirti is defending is not to assert the contrary but merely to say that neither of the alternatives he offers can be established.

Malcolm wrote:
It is not a hard problem at all. You are conscious [unless you are Turing machine], so am I. It is established at the outset you have a mind. So where does it come from? What is its origin? Etc. These are not hard problems, expect for materialists.

Vimalakirti432 said:
But this we find in all apologetics everywhere, the misuse of reason in defence of the faith. But logic can't establish this kind of thing, only yogic experience. So when an arhat or practitioner claims such knowledge I can only tip my hat and wish them the best. But when anyone tries to establish this kind of thing through logic I can only shake my head. Reason has many uses, but this isn't one.

Malcolm wrote:
The only one using apologetics here is you. What you are doing is called "eel-wriggling."

Vimalakirti432 said:
As for non-duality, I assume you mean that matter emerges from mind, i.e., the reverse of materialism? But in a previous post I've already touched on that, so I won't repeat myself here.

Vimalakirti432 said:
1. My assertion as to seeing things as they are without false imputations etc. hardly commits me to what you're calling "materialism". My point all the way through is that both "material" and "spiritual" are constructs. But here I think we get into the philosophic weeds that can hardly be cleared out in this kind of forum.

Malcolm wrote:
First we have to establish what an authority is. Buddhadharma accepts three kinds, direct perception, inferences based on direct perceptions and testimony.

Vimalakirti432 said:
2. I'm sure you're aware that Nagarjuna was also called a nihilist by many of his contemporaries. Now I'm not saying that my views adhere precisely to Nagarjuna in all respects, but I see myself here as beginning with his fundamental view of things, and not with some notion of materialism, ancient or modern. If my views come across differently then perhaps I'm not expressing myself very well.

Malcolm wrote:
Nāgārjuna has no position with respect to the ultimate existence or nonexistence of things, nevertheless, conventionally he accepted rebirth and karma, even in the MMK he makes it very clear he advocates the Arya Sammitya position with respect to karma — supporting their concept of the avipraṇaśa amongst all possible options. In the Pratītyasamutpādakarika he also makes it clear that conventionally he accepts rebirth and karma.

Vimalakirti432 said:
3. As for the relationship between what we could call nikaya Buddhism and Mahayana, Madhyamika, etc., I'm sure you know better than I do that it's extremely complex and that views on this depend on who you're talking to. So it seems to me pointless to set up and then cling to anything like a precise analysis of these relationships.

Malcolm wrote:
It is not that complicated.

Vimalakirti432 said:
4. No there is nothing supernatural about mind, karma and rebirth, which is precisely my point, and no I don't believe that saying this eviscerates the dharma, but only offers alternate skillful means.

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddha taught six dhātus, not only five — with consciousness being the sixth. Now, dhātu does not mean that there is one unified element, which is why we also have the idea of the sattva dhātu, the dhātu of sentient beings.

It is not a skillful means to cater to people's annihilationist tendencies any more than it is a skillful means to cater to their eternalist tendencies [though indeed the Buddha has said the latter is preferable to the former]. You have jumped on the horse only to fall off on the other side [annihilationism].

Vimalakirti432 said:
Otherwise, you appear to be well grounded in your tradition with firm shradda so of course I have to respect your point of view, even where I see that it may lead you to inaccurate imputation of an alternate way. And you may be correct in every respect.

Malcolm wrote:
First, before you make judgements about the imputations of others, you have to establish that your own cognitions are authoritative. Are you quite certain you are not the one making false imputations, i.e., false inferences?

Just a slight correction: I meant avoiding speech no likely to be of further use. I guess I can also add that I could respond to several of your points in discussion, but that we lack the basis to make that discussion fruitful. Again, with metta and all the best.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course we have no basis for further discussion because you are a priory committed to physicalism. You fail the first step of the heuristic that Dharmakīrti lays out in his proof of rebirth, i.e. do you think that the cause of a moment of mind is material or mental?

You seek refuge in some putative nonduality of matter and mind, and I am happy to understand that mind and matter are nondual, but in precisely the opposite way you intend.

Hi Malcolm. Here I would only maintain once again, that "materialist" is an unfair imputation in my case, and in the case of many others who consider themselves non-supernaturalists. But I guess we'll have to leave it there, in the interests of right speech. In this case, that means speech not likely to be of further use. I invite you to carefully read my other posts, if you're interested in fully understanding my views. We obviously have different predispositions, so from my side no harm no foul. With metta.

Malcolm wrote:
There is nothing supernatural about mind, nor is there anything supernatural about karma and the ripening of karma.

Your very use of the term "supernatural" to describe phenomena such as karma and rebirth places you squarely in the Carvaka camp. The Carvakas were not fools, and I don't take you to be one, they were very sophisticated thinkers who were a dominant school in pre-Hindu India. But it is undeniable that negating rebirth and karma eviscerates the Buddha's teaching and his Dharma.

The negation of rebirth and karma on a relative level is an extreme view, ucchedavāda, annihilationism.

Vimalakirti432 said:
1. As for the definition of "materialist", my point is that the tulku is setting up a straw man argument, replacing a variety of possible opposing points of view with a dimwitted, comic book version of a "materialist" of no real interest to anyone.

Malcolm wrote:
It does not matter what colors and shades you want to paint a materialist in, a materialist will always hold matter as a first principle, and consciousness as derivative from physical processes.

Vimalakirti432 said:
2. As for consciousness as an emergent property of matter, some certainly hold that view, but my point again is that the old dichotomy material/spiritual has been so subverted by what we now know of the uncanny nature of so-called "matter" as to render the old dichotomy meaningless. Does that mean that anything goes, that anything can happen? No, it simply means that we attend to what's there, without imposing dualities, and with a minimum of distorted, inaccurate or unskillful imputations.

Malcolm wrote:
Which is all to say that at the end of the day, consciousness is asserted to follow physical laws, hence materialism — and this observation is identical to the carvaka point of view.



Vimalakirti432 said:
3. As for different views of rebirth in Buddhism, I'm sure you're aware that most Theravadins have a very literal view of rebirth, kamma, nibbana, etc. and certainly would never say that rebirth from the ultimate side is "mumbo-jumbo" as the tulku did.

Malcolm wrote:
Sure they would — rebirth is irrelevant from the point of view of paramatthadhammas.

Vimalakirti432 said:
So while I agree that nearly everything in the Mahayana is prefigured in the early suttas, we can't ignore the significant differences. Certainly Theravadins don't.

Malcolm wrote:
The only substantially important different is whether the antarabhāva, aka bardo, is accepted or rejected. This is dealt with in the Koshabhaṣyaṃ

Vimalakirti432 said:
4. As for karma rooted in volition I agree, but again I can't subscribe to the supernaturalist amplifications of this idea that you note here.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, because you are a materialist, and therefore reject rebirth, and consider the ripening of karma described by the Buddha as "supernaturalist." It's ok, I mean, I don't care whether you accept rebirth or not — but it is impossible to practice Buddhadharma correctly without accepting rebirth, you know, the "supernatural" kind, not the bullshit revisionism we see bandied about these days. At best, you might, as in the Kalamas sutta, be able to have a bit of relaxation by practicing the four brahmaviharas, but you certainly will not enjoy liberation.

What you fail to understand is that in Buddhadharma, matter is regarded as an emergent property of minds, not the other way around.

Hence the critique from a Dzogchen perspective.
The point I am making is that intellectual analysis will only result in an intellectual apprehension of the object of analysis. Even when you are finished with the analysis, for example, the famous diamond sliver analysis, and so on, still in the end you are left with the concept "emptiness", "nonarising", "freedom from extremes" and so on, even though, as Mañjuśrimitra points out, since the conceptualized extreme does not exist, therefore the extreme to analyze does not exist. Therefore, conventional analysis by mundane minds cannot used in an ultimate analysis because they cannot escape their own conceptual clinging, indeed they are always with concepts.

It was particularly telling that he appeared to conflate these posited materialists with ancient Indian materialists or nihilists, the charvakas.

There is very little difference in their point of view.

Vimalakirti432 said:
In fact, with the advance of the sciences and especially of physics and cosmology what does the term "materialist" even mean?

Malcolm wrote:
It means one believes that consciousness arises as an emergent property of matter.

Vimalakirti432 said:
So while later Mahayana, Madhyamika and Tibetan Buddhism re-imagined rebirth in ways still unthinkable for Buddhist realists like the Theravadins, we should allow the same process to happen in modern Buddhism.

Malcolm wrote:
Nonsense, Mahāyāna concepts around rebirth, as well as those of Madhyamaka and so on are based grounded in the Abhidharma tradition of Sarvastivāda.


Vimalakirti432 said:
Rebirth and karma, I feel, are most properly seen in the deep context of interdependent origination, of infinite causes and conditions, and do not depend on ancient physiology, or on the notion of isolated streams of becoming, which violates the logic of the Mahayana in any case (non-distinctions, interpenetration, etc.).

Malcolm wrote:
No, they are properly seen in the context of what the Buddha taught: that is unique beginningless mindstreams have volitions, direct physical and verbal actions based on the volitions, and reap the results of those volitions in the future. In this case, Tibetan Buddhists mainly depend on the Sautrantika/Yogacara explanation for ripening, but not exclusively.
