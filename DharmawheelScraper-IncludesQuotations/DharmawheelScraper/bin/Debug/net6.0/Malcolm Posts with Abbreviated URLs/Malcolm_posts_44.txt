The origin of the custom of wearing white lower robes goes back to the fact that in ancient India, pious Buddhist lay people often wore all white cloths, indicating their status as upāsakas and upāsikās.

In Tibet, however, the garb of the so called "mantrins" became invested with much ritual significance, much of it coming from the tradition of Chō. And since there are so many traditions, it is not surprising that there have come to be much variance with respect the uniform of an upāsaka mantrin in Tibet. Exhibit A)




You can see here there is that most of these Repkong ngakpas wear an assortment of outfits. They are mainly recognizable through the distinctive coiled dreadlocks on their heads.

However, due to the important position of the Dudjom Tradition in the exile community and in West, the characteristic uniform of the mantrin students of Dudjom Rinpoche's followers has come to represent the standard uniform of upāsaka mantrins.

However, Buddhahood, as perfect knowledge and omniscience, is unchanging, and a change of fundamental state. But I leave it to those more learned and experienced to correct my misunderstandings.

There are three things: realization, liberation, full awakening.

Having a realization is not equivalent to liberation. There are many realizations one must have before one enters the path of seeing. Once one has entered the path of seeing however, one begins the process of liberation that culminates on full awakening, buddhahood, at the end of the tenth bhumi. The fullest account of this, in Mahāyāna is found in the Abhisamaya-alaṃkara.

The process of liberation means gradually abandoning the afflictions which cause rebirth in samsara. Full awakening means omniscience.

Well, for one, I think the "big deal" came about because early Western observers of the exile Tibetan community in the 1970's saw that there was a community of practitioners [like my guru Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje and Kunzang Dechen Lingpa] surrounding Dudjom Rinpoche who dressed in a specific uniform consisting of a white skirt, a stripped Zen, their hair bound in a topknot [often around a metal cylinder containing tantras and tagdrols].

These westerners saw this as a alternate ordination path, based on the lore that in the first decades of the 9th century, King Ralpcan honored the tiny community of Tibetan lay Vajrayāna practitioners on the same level as the tiny community of monastics, and based on legend that when Langdarma "destroyed" the monastic community, Nub Sangye Yeshe intimidated him into leaving the community of practitioners of Secret Mantra alone (Nub Sangye Yeshe definitely lived in the latter part of the 9th century and the beginning of the tenth. Nevertheless, Nubchen is considered one of the 25 disciples of Padmasambhava. In order to explain the latter fact, it is held that he lived for possibly as long as 130 years. Not an impossible feat by any means).

It seems certain to me that Langdarma's "persecution" of the monasteries was in fact his demand for taxes from the monasteries which had previously operated free of taxation that when the Tibetan economy went into serious recession in the early 840's (due to trade disruption along the silk route due to the fall of the Uyghur empire in 840). It was this that led to his assassination by Lhalung Palgyi Dorje.

...what's at stake in this discussion, given that the communities in question here don't have a baked-in demand for averting-bad-fortune, bringing-good-fortune rituals?

Malcolm wrote:
On a purely social and economic level, as a culture Tibetans have proven themselves, since the '59 diaspora, remarkably effective in creating and cultivating clients, thus creating a demand for the services they provide. These services range from religious instruction to the kind of apotropaic rituals described above, and everything in between.

DGA said:
I attended a retreat a year or two ago at a large center in rural Colorado.  I volunteered for "karma yoga" duty, which put me in the kitchen washing dishes.  I did what I ordinarily do:  rolled up my sleeves, put an apron on, tied up my hair, and got to it.  No problem.  Someone else on KP duty at that time had evidently committed to the full ngakmo costume at all times, meaning that she struggled to scrub teacups one at a time while wearing a zentra and with her hair down.  Not too productive.  It was kind of sad.  One assumes that the role of a ngakpa/mo is not to make oneself useless, no?

Malcolm wrote:
There are all kinds of commitments one can undertake, but the idea that one is required, like monastics, to wear special "Ngakpa robes" at all times, is a complete misunderstanding. There are all kinds of Ngakpa styles, short haired, long haired, monastic, dread-locked, etc.

For many Tibetans, the term sngags pa really just means, "lay people with long hair who practice rituals, eat meat, drink booze, and chase girls." While among western Nyingmapas, Ngakpas are revered with near comical devotion, the situation among Tibetans is just not the same, just as Indians do not really think that sadhus are all that. Also, as you point out, there is no market for western Ngakpas, not really. Though there are some who go around and try to cultivate markets for their services, some more successful, some less, the fact is that the Ngakpa tradition as a whole serves a segment of the Tibetan population with rites that in some respect are not really proper for monks to engage in, such as divination, hail prevention, and so on. As you astutely point out, there is no baked in demand for Ngakpa services in the West. I just don't see Ngakpas replacing Evangelical Christian prayer circles for driving out demons and so on any time soon. Perhaps in Mexico on down to South America, the situation will be a little different.

Anyway, I keep my own Ngakpa gear tucked away nicely. Maybe some day I will see a reason to put it on, but frankly, I have not seen such a reason for some years.

No one ever claimed that one was able to introduce oneself to the basis, or that having been introduced, there was nothing further to do. But what is stated is that there is nothing that needs to be transformed, changed or otherwise modified as a result of such an introduction. One needs only to familiarize oneself with the subject that was introduced. Indeed, in Dzogchen teachings, vidyā or rig pa is sometimes referred to as "the conditional basis," because vidyā or rig pa is conditional upon introduction and does not exist without it.

Of course, we don’t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed. I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record. At the same time, however, given that we don’t know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don’t want to create a misleading impression.

As to the idea that sentient beings are buddhas without knowing it, this is a popular misunderstanding based on looking at the words but not understanding the meaning.

Malcolm wrote:
That recognition is itself vidyā, mahāmudra, and prajñapārāmita.

That recognition is not a consequence of practice nor of meditation, it is a consequence solely of introduction. "Practice" consists of deepening familiarization with that recognition. As the Self-Arising Vidyā Tantra states in Chapter 4:
It exists as something that can be illustrated
to all unrealized sentient beings. 
There is neither arising nor declining
in the transcendent state of the tathāgatas.
Further, if it is asked what is the system of liberation,
it is liberation through the meaning of the oral instruction.

If it is a result of applying the teaching then it arises conditionally based on the teaching.  ie The result is conditioned.

Malcolm wrote:
For example, previously one could not recognize gold. However one can recognize gold when instructed in how to recognize it, but that gold is not produced by the recognition. Likewise, previously one could not recognize dharmatā. However one can recognize dharmatā when instructed in how to recognize it, but that dharmatā is not produced by the recognition.

Unlike gold, however, dharmatā is not a conditioned or compounded entity. Dharmatā does not arise dependent on the introduction. Dharmatā, one's own nature, is present whether or not it is recognized, like the wish-fulfilling gem concealed under the lintel of a pauper's door.

Just as a gold bed pan or a gold Buddha statue are equally made of gold, when our own nature is not recognized, it is called "the basis." When it is recognized, it is called "the result," but it has itself undergone no transformation at all. For this reason then, the result is never conditioned because the basis is never conditioned. Nonrecognition of the basis is not a fault of the basis, it is a fault of the consciousness which apprehends the basis. When the basis is rightly apprehended, this is called vidyā, rig pa or knowledge. When the basis is incorrectly apprehended, this is called avidyā, ma rig pa, or ignorance.

The one who talks about relative and ultimate—

Since I, the creator of all, have made all Dharmas,

We have unconsciously inherited this idea from the kind of Buddhist historiography we find in the West, in general.

While such ideas are not absent from traditional hermeneutics, the traditional approach to this in Tibet, for example, is predicated on the three vows, rather than historical analysis of the Pali Canon, the Agamas, and so on, because the traditional sense of Buddhist history does not proceed from the same set of assumptions Westerners use to approach Buddhist history (text critical, etc.). Astus' approach exemplifies the Western approach very well, in his assumption that the Nikāya/Agamas form a layer of teachings earlier than and prior to Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna, so that without the former, the latter could not have arisen.

Although if there is no common ground for the various groups, it also means that the paths they distinguish are different, and they actually do not say anything about the others, but rather simply make up their own structure of teachings. For example, the nine vehicles of the Nyingmapas say nothing about the teachings of the Kagyupas or the Theravadins, because those nine are merely their own interpretation of the teachings.

Malcolm wrote:
The nine yānas are also a taxonomy, a way of presenting distinct kinds of methodologies. Noone ever claimed they were a "core teaching." The Kagyus however, never dispute the nine yāna presentation, no matter how much it may have been disputed by first Sakyapas, and later, Gelugpas.

So what might be a core teaching of the Buddha, as opposed to a taxonomy?

Malcolm wrote:
Well, no. There is a famous account in the sūtras concerning one of Buddha's past lives.  Long ago, there were two groups of śrāmaneras. One group was headed by a very strict leader, whose discipline and renunciation was impeccable as it was famous. The other group was headed by a very liberal leader, who encouraged his students to go into the towns in the evenings, and mingle with the townsfolk in bars and restaurants, associating with men and women alike.

When the leader of the first faction heard about this, he was immediately disapproving of the second faction and their leader and reproached him severely. The long and short of it is, the first leader spent time in lower realms, and when he took rebirth as Śakyamuni Buddha, his sangha fractured into sectarianism as a karmic residue resulting from his criticism of the more liberal monk and his sangha.


Sherab Dorje said:
The argument for the Great Perfection, the summum bonum of all vehicles, is based on the fact that it cannot be ascertained through words and explanations, but only on the basis of the intimate instructions of a guru, which are not (as is commonly misunderstood from the name "intimate instructions," "pith instructions," and so on) solely based on explanations, but are a means of introducing someone to their own state in the form of a direct sensory perception which bypasses conceptual constructs. When a person with the fortune to meet a guru with such a lineage of instructions (assuming that person recognizes the meaning of the intimate instructions which they have been given), they will have no fear of ever falling into three lower realms ever again.
That's not an argument, that is an explanation of the didactic method and rhetoric about the effect.

If it is asked, “What is the method for realizing the definitive meaning through the indirect method?,” since nonactivity is illustrated with the activity of fabricated efforts, like pointing at the moon with a finger, also awakened mind correctly grasped through a symbol will accomplish awakening because the Bhagavan Buddha, the teacher of devas and humans, has declared that it is “great awakening.” Any unfortunate one who conceptualizes entities should make efforts in the indirect method of realization. 

In that case, this which is to be explained is the basis or cause of the meditation that generates ultimate awakened mind itself. If it is asked what that is, it is samadhi and mudra. 

Now then, through the power of cultivating the three samadhis of suchness, universal illumination and the cause, [14/a] one will be stable, and not carried away by negative conditions. After the meditation of binding the three symbolic mudras of buddhahood— the body (mahāmudra), the mind (samaya mudra), and the activities (karmamudra)—generate the mind as the great dharmamudra (the symbol of speech). One should then meditate the recitation of the essence mantra.

If one meditates generating the thought that the samadhis and the mudras are dharmatā and therefore are not different, the ultimate awakened mind will arise. If one actualizes the meditation, one realizes that all phenomena do not exist apart from one’s mind. The accumulations are gathered and obscurations are purified because of that meditation. One becomes realized because one’s continuum is blessed by the deity of pristine consciousness

Someone who is not expert in paths will not necessarily be able to distinguish a correct path from an incorrect path, or a superior path from an inferior path. Only some people have the necessary knowledge to make such an evaluation.

Likewise, someone who is not expert in gems will not necessarily be able to discern a real diamond from a fake diamond, a high quality diamond from a low quality diamond. Only some people have the necessary skills to make such an evaluation.

Since this is so, the fact that these criteria are only accepted by some Vajrayānis merely indicates that the skill to evaluate all paths is missing from schools other than Vajrayāna, and in particular, the Great Perfection.

Furthermore, the purpose of evaluating paths is due to the fact that everyone wishes to achieve liberation as rapidly as possible. Likewise, the purpose of evaluating gemstones is due to the fact that everyone wishes to know that they are buying the best quality gem possible.

Sherab Dorje said:
Fair enough, but a promise of rapid liberation is not a guarantee of rapid liberation.

And, of course, one should rely on expert advice, but it always happens to be the case that the expert giving the advice happens to be a practitioner of the path/vehicle, regardless of the path/vehicle.  Proof of the pudding is in the eating, yes?

But what I like to do, is not judge a tradition by its adepts, because the adepts of any religion/tradition seem to display the same qualities, I like to judge by the qualities displayed by middling/average practitioners.  They tend to be the dead giveaways.

Malcolm wrote:
Mahāyāna in general does not promise a rapid path— quite the opposite in fact— but nevertheless promises a higher path than Hinayāna. So long in fact, that by the criteria you suggest, most definitely middling and average practitioners of Mahāyāna will appear afflicted by comparison to even average practitioners of Hinayāna, so that is not a sure means of evaluation of paths.

With respect to liberation, the criteria of liberation is freedom from afflictions. But this also cannot be evaluated from outside. However, liberation is just half the Buddhist path, there is also omniscience. Since this omniscience is primarily defined from knowledge of the paths of awakening, it is also difficult to ascertain from outside.

The arguments for the efficacy of Vajrayāna over Mahāyāna is based on being an easy path, with many methods, for those of sharp faculties, and so on.

The argument for the Great Perfection, the summum bonum of all vehicles, is based on the fact that it cannot be ascertained through words and explanations, but only on the basis of the intimate instructions of a guru, which are not (as is commonly misunderstood from the name "intimate instructions," "pith instructions," and so on) solely based on explanations, but are a means of introducing someone to their own state in the form of a direct sensory perception which bypasses conceptual constructs. When a person with the fortune to meet a guru with such a lineage of instructions (assuming that person recognizes the meaning of the intimate instructions which they have been given), they will have no fear of ever falling into three lower realms ever again.

The point is not to proclaim, "My diamond is unflawed, yours is flawed," the point is to relieve sentient beings from anxiety about being forever trapped in samsara. This is why I reject your charge of triumphalism. If someone thinks that Dzogchen rhetoric is mere triumphalism, they have not understood the point of Dzogchen at all in the first place.

Gyurme Kundrol said:
Ive been studying wrathful practices, their meaning and purpose, and came across the idea that the essence of wrathful practice is something like trekchod- an immediate and forceful cutting through of delusion and a return to the non-dual state. Is trekchod considered a wrathful practice and if you can do trekchod well is there even any need to get wrathful empowerments? Does a wrathful practice (such as Vajrakilaya) add anything that trekchod doesnt already include?

Also are there wrathful practices which can be done without empowerments and or if you have received certain empowerments like the Zhitro are there wrathful practices you can do even if you havent received a special empowerment for that particular deity?

Malcolm wrote:
Trekchö is not a wrathful practice, and it involves no effort. If one is using effort to "cut through" anything, one has not discovered trekchö.

As to your second question; while wrathful yidams like Kilaya are for dealing with secondary issues, they can also be used as means for discovering the meaning of trekchö. Mañjuśrīmitra writes:
Furthermore, since the teacher has declared that awakening can be correctly grasped with a symbol,
in that case, this is the basis of the meditation that generates awakened mind. 
After the three samadhis are stable and after binding the three symbolic mudras, 
generate the mind as the great dharmamudra and meditate the recitation of the essence [mantra].
People who, for whatever reason are not capable of directly approaching the meaning of the Great Perfection directly, can do so indirectly via the means of sadhana practice.

Finally, there are no wrathful practices that do not require empowerment, but having received more or less any Shitro empowerment, from that point onward one only needs the lung and the instructions in order to practice any sadhana.

Wayfarer said:
I am aware of several online training courses and resources for Buddhist teachings, such as Dharma Ocean, and FPMT, and DharmaNet. However I think a useful resource would be a structured home-study and practice program, with some teacher oversight.

In my case, I have a regular daily practice, and have attended retreats and lectures so am familiar with the Buddhist teachings and principles. But my own practice is a bit patchy and I think a curriculum of things to learn, and a regular schedule of activities, would really help to give it structure; I feel like I'm wasting a lot of time by being so irregular in my practice, but I'm not that good at self-management with nobody to oversee my activities.

For instance, in monastic and retreat centres, there is a regular schedule, and also a calendar, around which observances and practices are organised. A lightweight version of that approach would be really helpful. I wouldn't imagine it would need to go to nearly the same depth as the above-mentioned centres. But it could incorporate some liturgical materials, meditation practices, and things to commit to memory, and so on.

Is the community aware of any such resources out there?

there is no distinction between sharpness and dullness in capacities.
If one practices, even a cowherd will be liberated.
If one understands the significance of the luminosity of one’s mind through direct perception,

We never discuss Christian violence against Muslims in Africa. 60,000 Muslims fled the Central African Republic in 2014 fleeing Christian militias intent on murdering them.

I'm interested in this more because this kind of thinking seems to be a symptom of something more immediate.
Other factors are at work in creating a conspiratorial mind. Uscinski and Parent note that in laboratory experiments “researchers have found that inducing anxiety or loss of control triggers respondents to see nonexistent patterns and evoke conspiratorial explanations” and that in the real world “there is evidence that disasters (e.g., earthquakes) and other high-stress situations (e.g., job uncertainty) prompt people to concoct, embrace, and repeat conspiracy theories.”

Other factors-
1. Group Identity
2. Education

There are many reasons we need broader participation in community and community decision making and I'd go farther and say, reorganization of the wealth distribution system. Happiness of our fellows, encouraging everyone to have a sense of agency, might be one of the most important.

There's already been a sūtra reference from a polemical sūtra, so I may start there...In this context the passage on the three turnings of the wheel of doctrine is presented. Here the underlying intent (samdhi) not only of Hinayana teaching but also of the Prajnaparamita scriptures is presented as in need of explication, for their meaning has to be drawn out (neyartha) through the fully explicit (nitartha) hermeneutic of the previous analysis of consciousness...If you are familiar with this sūtra, do you happen to know the reasons that are found therein as to why the "Hinayana" teachings were/had to be taught in such a way?


Malcolm wrote:
The sūtra is silent on the subject of the three turnings apart from mentioning them and giving an outline of the them. No other sūtra mentions the subject.

The Indian tradition, what we possess of it, is also largely silent on the matter. Tibetan traditions following Buton have seized on the matter and have expressed a number of different interpretations, but generally consider the tathāgatagarbha doctrine is being the principle representative of the third turning. The Gelugpa are contrarians here in this respect, rejecting the Saṃdhinirmocana and the third turning as provisional since they locate this sūtra in the Yogacara school since it also mentions the ālayavijñāna.


Coëmgenu said:
If the Buddha were capable of giving teachings where "their meaning [does not have] to be drawn out (neyartha) through the fully explicit (nitartha) hermeneutic of the previous analysis of consciousness," why didn't he just teach the "perfect" teaching at the beginning?

It also depends on the degree you get.

Many liberal arts degrees don't get you anything, except maybe some entry level job paying $25,000 a year. That's fine if you have parents paying your rent while you work for less than minimum wage and gain experience. If you're smart enough, you'll be able to translate that into something better in a few years. Or you go back to grad school after a while. Takes money to make money, they say.

If you don't have that luxury, don't have any particular genius, you probably should pursue a Bachelor of Science (instead of arts), and pick a field where there are demands. Engineering, nursing, for instance. Be willing to transfer where the jobs are when you graduate. You may not get to live someplace sexy like San Francisco or Brooklyn or Austin, but you'll be in a position to have a solid middle class life by taking that chemical engineering job in St. Louis.

The dirty secret they don't tell kids coming up the social ladder is that they don't have the luxury of reading literature for four years or studying art history unless their parents are in a position to support them through the first few years of their post-college lives so that they can take poorly paying or non-paying jobs that allow you the experience, exposure and connections you need to build one of those creative careers.

I know little about Dzogchen but I know there is a Bodhisattva vow that warns against disparaging lesser paths, namely Hinayana, because a Bodhisattva must understand and appreciate all the necessary means for any individual being to attain enlightenment.

Malcolm wrote:
You cannot understand all paths unless you understand the limitation of each path.

Dzogchen, being the essence of all paths, merely points out the limitations of other paths, i.e., the ways in which they obscure the meaning of buddhahood.


Jeff H said:

Malcolm wrote:
The notion of gradual vs. sudden is a self-imposed limitation. Dzogchen does not make a distinction between persons of sharper and duller capacity, for example, unlike lower paths. In Dzogchen, there is no notion that there are some people who cannot understand the meaning of Dzogchen.

There is only the notion that there are people who either have not had the fortune of meeting Dzogchen teachings or whose own conceptuality regarding cause and effect, and so on, prevent them from embracing Dzogchen teachings whole-heartedly.

Once a person decides to embrace Dzogchen teachings and is willing to dispense with the conceptual limitations about buddhahood imposed by the paths of cause and result, there is no obstacle placed in the way of people who wish to learn about Dzogchen teachings. Dzogchen teachings make no distinction between persons of sharper and duller capacity as I mentioned above. A proper teacher is all that one requires to follow Dzogchen teachings.

Any teacher who claims that Dzogchen requires one to be a person of high capacity, etc., frankly, does not know what they are talking about and should be immediately understood as a person of very limited understanding of Dzogchen teachings.

On the other hand, there are today teachers who use the name "Dzogchen" to defraud students into following them, who then never give actual teachings on Dzogchen, or who are given mistaken teachings on Dzogchen. So, caveat emptor.

Who can consider Vinaya reliable since it is embedded in ancient gender disparities between men and women? How are they even relevant today?

Even the way the vow against sexual misconduct is formulated (even where I agree with it) is a reflection of patriarchal economic values embedded in property relations and principally refers to male sexual conduct. The formulation of bhikṣuni vows is clearly oppressive towards women since they must follow an additional 111 extra vows, on top of the 253 vows prescribed for bhikṣus.

Thus, in the face of this kind of disparity, whether or not monks watch porn is pretty much a nonissue since Buddhist institutional monasticism systematically oppresses women.

Of course, this expectation created a situation where, in Tibet, the convention came to be telling lay people that they were not privileged to know what monks vows were, because if they did know, they might criticize monastics for breaches of their discipline and loose faith.

Interestingly, after being rejected by the Tibetans proper in Tshang, the Dzogchen teachings were first spread and preserved on the Tibetan plateau in a matriarchal society, the country of rGyal mo tsha ba rong, literally, "The Hot Gorge of the Queens.

Gyurme Kundrol said:
The rGyalrong are one of the many ethnic and linguistic groups of western Sichuan.  Due to the extreme nature of the mountains and valleys where they live, they have been relatively isolated throughout much of their history, resulting in a wide variety of divergent dialects.  There is documentation of the rGyalrong as early as the Tang dynasty (AD 608-917) describing a legendary matriarchal society, ruled by a queen, protected by fortress-like watchtowers along a river of gold.  Ancient towers still stand, and the Dajin River (大金川, Big Gold River) flows through rGyalrong territory, historically rich in gold.

Well, I for one have never said a Vajrayana practitioner cannot resort to renunciation. But the "canker of sensuality" is a phrase that hardly belongs to the language of Vajrayana. "Indulging in pleasure" is also a heavily loaded expression, is it not?

Malcolm wrote:
Well, this is not entirely true. We discuss asrava ( zag pa ) all the time in Vajrayāna even in Dzogchen. The "body with effluents" is a common phrase, and effluents here refers to the three or five afflictions.



treehuggingoctopus said:
What never ceases to amaze me is that "pleasure-seeking" or "indulging in pleasure" becomes a problem for some people (almost) only when it comes to sex. It is OK when one takes great pleasure in what one is eating, studying, listening to, reflecting on, drinking (provided it is alcohol-free!), etc. It is also quite OK to pursue openly such pleasures, and talk about doing so. Everybody praises our erudition, or the exquisite honing of some of our skills, or our devotion to a particularly charming hobby.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, all of these activities are associated with asravas, i.e., "outflows," effluents," or "cankers" (weeping sores).

Vajrayāna does not deny afflicted phenomena. Its approach to them with respect to the path however differs markedly from lower yānas as you know.

A bit of self-directed valid criticism (because in your hurry to respond negatively to what I said, it seems you did not notice that the criticism was directed at myself too) goes a long fracking way.  I, at least, am willing to admit my incapacity as a practitioner.  Hopefully it will save me a tonne of suffering in the future.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, praising oneself with faint criticism is often a proffered justification of the harsh criticism of others, i.e., "I'm not perfect, but that other person..."

As far as the three vows go, this is an interesting literature, but none of it is decisive nor conclusive. Why? Because no one agrees on how they should be interpreted, for example, the controversy over whether the fifth samaya merely refers to abandoning Mahāyāna bodhicitta, or the release of semen. Tibetan scholars spend lifetimes obsessing about issues which are of no fundamental importance.

However, if we get the essence of the three vows, rather than being distracted by their particulars, the essence of the Hinayāna vows is not harming others. Therefore, the evaluation of pornography from this point of view should be "Does my action of indulging in erotica or pornography harm others?"

The essence of Mahāyāna vows is helping sentient beings. Therefore, the evaluation of pornography should be, "Does my action of indulging in erotica or pornography cause me to objectify women (and men)— treating them as objects of personal gratification— and cause me to  lose sight of them as persons deserving of my compassion?"

The essence of general Secret Mantra vows is pure vision. Therefore, the evaluation of pornography from this point of view should be "Does my action of indulging in erotica or pornography lead me into engage in impure vision?"

We won't get into Dzogchen, since in Dzogchen, there is nothing to abandon or adopt, but only something to recognize.

I think you have too specific a definition of "middle", conditioned by your own perspective. It seems like you are using middle as an absolute point, with Marxism on the left and crony capitalism with reactionary social views to the right.

I personally would just call middle and mainstream whatever is in mainstream political discourse. The Overton window.

What is "middle" today in America was not "middle" 100 years ago, nor middle in Roman times. I'd argue for example that socialist parties posed a far greater threat to capitalism in the pre-WW2 period than they do today. So "Leftism" then was a much more effective opponent of the "Right" than it is today. But both "Left" and "Right" are meaningless if you extend the timeline over a longer period.

There are plenty of things that are not mainstream and not necessarily alt-right, for example, what I discussed in the OP, that progress and growth will face limits, we cannot expect perpetual economic growth. Even Green parties don't discuss this.

Nobody asked her to comply -  not in either of the translations I'm looking at. And just for everyone else who reads this Dowman has that she went to her new husband "without demur", i.e. without protest and the usual nonsense.

In the Tibetan, "After her husband came and took her to his house...." the verb is khyer ba which means "to be carried away" The verb is commonly used to describe what happens to one when caught in a flood. This term indicates that she did not go willingly, especially in light of the protest against her parents.

Dowman's translation above is excessively interpretive— the words "new home," "demur, "cheerful," "uncomplaining," and "expected" exist nowhere in the Tibetan text and are not implied at all.


maybay said:

Well that's just your opinion man. The story goes she was from wealthy family. Drudgery seems unlikely. It it weren't for Kukkuripa she wouldn't have considered liberation.

Malcolm wrote:
You miss another essential point in the story— that she sat for a whole day looking at the broken pot on the ground. Why do you think so?

Considering that she had already been beaten and abused verbally by her parents for running off to follow Kukkuripa to begin with, and was "carried off" or "taken" by her husband after having remain on her own for a year following that, the entire story suggests that she was in a situation of involuntary, domestic servitude (the condition of billions of women and girls in the world today) through an arranged marriage over which she had no control— which is what makes her doha at the end more poignant.
Now I shall go to great bliss without returning 
to the house of samsara.
In this case, the "happy" housewife is equating her home with samsara. Some happy housewife.


maybay said:
I don't know why you seem so desperate to deny this possibility.

Malcolm wrote:
This issue is not housewives in general and the obvious fact that many women today find this a fulfilling, satisfying life. The issue is Manibhadra specifically, and her obvious unhappiness with her state of domestic servitude, her youthful rebellion and her eventual emancipation more than a decade after meeting her guru.

Indeed, this tale is edifying example for women inso far as Manibhadra shakes free of the shackles of mundane, patriarchal domesticity and realizes her own power as an independent women. Recall that in general the tales of the 84 Mahāsiddhas virtually always contain some element of transgression of conventional norms. A common women shaking free of her domestic role and abandoning her husband and young children would have been nothing short of totally shocking and transgressive to Indians in the 11th century.

My critique is not directed at liberated men and women, but rather the patriarchal values that overlook, demean, and obscure women (with rare exceptions like the four female Mahāsiddhas, the Therigatha and so on) through the near total silence of women's voices and the obvious male fetishization of women found in Buddhist literature in general, and particularly in the Niruttarayogatantras.

The point of the story is that she is unhappy with family life, and when she breaks the pot she says:
To what home will
beginningless sentient beings go
when the clay vessel of their bodies is broken?
My clay vessel has long been broken, 
Now I shall go to great bliss without returning 
to the house of samsara.
E ma! Those who wish to attain bliss
should rely on the amazing guru!
You also seem to lack the understanding that she rebelled against her parents after receiving the Cakrasamvara empowerment and instructions from Kukkurpa:
The guru saw that the girl's continuum was ripe, and bestowed upon her the empowerment of Cakrasamvara. After she was given the instruction for unifying creation and completion, she practiced in that retreat place for a week. Then she retuned to her parents. 

Since they beat and derided her, the girl said, "If the three realms are pure, are you not my parents? Though your family and lineage are important, you do not turn away from samsara. I have been struck by the accomplishment of liberation based on my guru! I shall follow the path," and left them speechless. 

She then cultivated her guru's instructions and having giving up all activities, she remained for one year. After her husband came and took her to his house, she did all the mundane work and activities, she agreed to comply in body and speech, and spoke pleasantly, and so on.
She continued in this way for 12 years, had a couple of kids, etc., then she has the incident with the pot. So I think that your characterization (while understandable given the way it is presented in the translation you are using) is thoroughly inaccurate.

If we are going to characterize this story, I think Manibhadra the Domestic Drudge is a more apt analogy than "Happy Housewife."

In terms of the Ghantapāda story, the point is that is representative of male-centered tropes which belie the oft touted gender egalitarianism of Vajrayāna.

Thus far, no gender scholars have emerged who are sufficiently educated about and intimate with the primary and secondary literature of Vajrayāna to make any sustained critique of its systematic sexism and replacement of women's voices with narratives which mainly serve to reinforce human female subordination to male whimsies, while transforming empowered women into dangerous Others in the form of witches (ḍākinīs) and hags (matrikas).

you know some Mahasiddhas had prostitute consorts or some were prostitutes themselves? and they are described as dakinis taking form of prostitute. Can you just for a second imagine that porn start can be dakini too or daka for that matter?

Malcolm wrote:
The reason that Darikpa, a prince, was ordered by his teacher Luipa to serve a courtesan (not really the same as a prostitute, and did not necessarily involve sex work) was to cut his pride.

This brings up another issue: the extent to which, in the West in particular, Vajrayāna tropes such as "Mahasiddhas had prostitute consorts or some were prostitutes themselves" serve male fantasies since women's voices in these scenarios are entirely absent, apart from narratives entirely written by men which generally portray women as treacherous and dangerous to the project of yoga, as in the tale of Ghantapāda:

Karinos said:
There was a wicked whore in Pataliputra who told Devapala that she would be able to corrupt Ghantapa and ruin him. This vile woman had a virtuous and unspoiled virgin daughter who was commanded to seduce the yogin. As Ghantapa would meditate the young girl would bow and circumambulate him, begging for the opportunity to serve him and be his patron. He resisted but the girl was persistent. Ghantapa eventually moved to a small hut for the monsoon season and although the maiden followed him; he requested that his food only be brought by male servants.

For two weeks, only men tended to the yogin but on the fifteenth day the young woman told them to stay back and she went herself. When Ghantapa asked her to leave she complained that there were rain clouds in the sky and that she should wait until they pass. Once the clouds had passed it was getting dark and she cried saying that if she were to leave at night bandits would kill her. He told her that she had to sleep outside but as it got colder during the night she moved into the hut. Saying she was cold, she got closer and closer until eventually their bodies touched and thus the two came together in tantric union.

Malcolm wrote:
http://www.himalayanart.org/search/set.cfm?setID=332

Here, we have a "wicked whore" (how do we know she was wicked? What is her story?) who has a "virtuous and unspoiled virgin daughter," (at this point, we really are in a patriarchal Catholic universe where the virginity of women has "moral," and thus economic value). We have the celibate yogin, who resists this delectable young women, until, out of his kindness, he lets her stay the night because he fears for her safety. "Naturally," he is unable to resist her charms, but manages in the story to foil the plot of the "vile woman" to subvert him with the erotic power of her "virtuous and unspoiled virgin daughter." And of course, story portrays Ghantapāda as a sexual naif who takes no responsibility for his own arousal, shifting it onto the dangerous Other.

Certainly, as I note above, the manuals for selecting female consorts differ very little from the descriptions of different kinds of women found in erotic manuals like the Kama Sūtra. But what are notably absent in such manuals are the graphic descriptions of men appropriate for each of these kinds of women, described as padminis, conches, and so on based on descriptions of women's breasts, vaginas, teeth, lips, eyes, and vaginas. At least the Kama Sūtra contains descriptions of types of men, their body types, the size of their penises and the kind of women for which those penises are best suited. Corresponding descriptions of male phenotypes and their genitalia are conspicuously absent from manuals which describe such women. Present however is the strong recommendation to inflame passion through the standard Indian tropes of kissing, pinching, biting, and so on, as well as "erotic conversation (aka "talk dirty to me")" and use of visual erotica as preliminaries for karmamudra practice.  Monks and single men, of course, who wished to engage in these practice, needed to use a different kind of "consort," i.e. their hands, while visualizing an imagined consort and imagining these behaviors (you may think I am kidding, but I am not.)

Indeed, we really have to understand these stories as patriarchal accounts which obscure womens' stories, which render them as dangerous, which fundamentally serve male fantasies through the way patriarchal society fetishizes women (virginity vs. prostitution; celibacy vs. being sexual active; treacherous women vs. honorable men and so on).

For one thing, Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen and the Sakya school in general complete rejects this interpretation. The fifth samaya is simply an indication that one should abandon not relative and ultimate bodhicitta. The idea that it includes semen is also a problem, since the word in Tibetan is khu ba, and depending on context, it wither refers merely to the reproductive seed, or the precursor substances which is divided into reproductive seed and ojas (mdangs). ChNN, in his Birth, Life and Death, states unequivocally, that the reproductive seed is a complete waste product of the body and should be released. According to him, attempts to conserve can lead to sexual dysfunction, stones, and so on. His point of view is supported in various Ayurveda and Tibetan medicine, as well as cycles such as the Khandro Nyinthig.

Gyurme Kundrol said:
When the subject of sex comes up it seems most practitioners lose their common sense.

Instead of engaging in the categorization and definition of pornography as better or worse, good or bad, pure or vile, we should be engaging in pure view generally. Instead of judging a monk for masturbation we should judge ourselves for not having pure view towards our Vajra brothers and sisters. Instead of thinking some sex and some porn is fine but others is not we should seek to view all phenomena as the innately pure and empty display of the energies of our awareness. Instead of engaging in mental gymnastics to rationalize our attachment to sex we should remember the four noble truths and the fact that even small attachments will lead to small suffering, so needless to say great attachment will lead to great suffering.

Attachment leading to suffering doesnt stop just because we are attached to something we like a lot. In fact it only makes things worse. Even a house holder can overcome sexual desire while fulfilling martial duties.

Vajrayana and Tantra in general gives us the tools to deal with all these things. Sexual desire can be overcome, and saying "Im a householder" or "society is full of sex" or "this is the degenerate age" is just making excuses. You are either serious about liberation or you are not. You either want freedom or you do not. If you are serious then you will work with these energies and seek to no longer let them be your master and delude you. If not... then you will allow certain attachments to flourish and as a result will keep suffering in a state of delusion and probably stay in Samsara at least for a little while longer.

Ultimately if you are not willing to give up sexual desire you should never take Vajrayana vows. Refuge and Bodhisattva vows are fine, but Tantric vows require you to seek mastery over these energies and attachments and failure to do this is breaking your Samaya and you will suffer as a result of that.
"The fifth (root downfall) is, with a desirous mind and at an inappropriate time, intentionally emitting semen, thus forsaking the bodhicitta generated for sentient beings. The appropriate times to allow seminal fluid to leave the body are during the secret empowerment as an offering to the deities, when increasing the family line of ancestral heritage, and when making special pills or other medicines. Otherwise and especially out of desire, to ignore the words of honor and training and emit semen for ones own personal satisfaction outside the context of higher anuyoga practice constitutes the downfall. This also includes the abandonment of bodhicitta for any sentient being, because bodhicitta and the essential fluid are seen as one on the level of generation stage practice (of inner tantra). If aspirational bodhicitta is abandoned, practical bodhicitta is automatically forsaken.

-Perfect Conduct, Ascertaining the Three Vows - Commentary by Dudjom Rinpoche"
Overall its pretty straightfoward. Anyone holding Vajrayana vows should not engage these activities. Those who do not, can do as they like but the Buddha is clear that attachment leads to suffering. From an ultimate perspective its made clear all phenomena are primordially pure displays of luminous emptiness. So we should practice at the highest level we are capable of and should seek to stay committed to our vows. These vows we take also include pure view towards our Vajra brothers and sisters, which means not judging their conduct even if it is wrong and even if it occurs in a space we consider sacred.

There are also ways to go about calling someone out for breaking their Samaya and so forth, I dont recall where I read about it though and it has to be approached in a certain way. Certainly a mind of compassion is required since judging and pointing fingers and making lots of "you" statements wont do any good. Looking down on those who we share lineage with doesnt help us at all. And until our own minds are free from defilement we really shouldnt even attempt to correct others but should just keep working on ourselves.

While stitching a cut on the hand of a 75 year old farmer, the doctor struck up a conversation with the old man. Eventually the topic got around to Donald Trump and his role as the Republican Nominee for President.
The old farmer said, " Well, as I see it, Donald Trump is like a 'Post Tortoise'.''
Not being familiar with the term, the doctor asked him what a 'post tortoise' was.
The old farmer said, "When you're driving down a country road and you come across a fence post with a tortoise balanced on top, that's a post tortoise."
The old farmer saw the puzzled look on the doctor's face so he continued to explain. "You know he didn't get up there by himself, he doesn't belong up there, he doesn't know what to do while he's up there, he's elevated beyond his ability to function, and you just wonder what kind of dumb ass put him up there to begin with."

kirtu said:
Really?  It's small minded gossip to keep ones vows at a monastery during a retreat?  And these were full-time renunciates.

I agree that there are more important things in order to directly reduce short term suffering though and Malcolm highlights two of them.  Unfortunately the US and Russia and other nations spread their poison of weapons throughout the world.  People have been advocating that weapons sales from the West stop for many decades.  This has fallen on deaf ears.  Even after German tracked vehicles sold to Turkey were used to torture and kill PKK members (terrorists to the Turkish government and majority Turks), even after this hit front page newspapers decades ago, weapons were still sold.

Even now the US fails to lead on climate change forcing some of the rest of the world to initiate necessary but much too belated changes wrt energy production and efficiency and the transformation necessary to reign in mindless farming.  Still no one has significantly raised other pressing environmental issues at a high enough level.

Powerful people will always fail to lead on pressing issues until it is too late.  Wars will consume mankind.  People who are supposed to be representatives of Shakyamuni Buddha should at least keep their vows purely it shouldn't take a ngakpa, even a highly revered one, to remind them of that.

I am not sure where this appears outside of the Tibetan Vinaya Ksudraka, but in Buton's History of Indian and Tibetan Buddhism he relates how Mahakasyapa knew that when Ajatasatru heared of the Buddha's death he would surely die unless he was placed into first seven troughs of fresh butter and then a trough of sandal wood. This happens, the Bramin Varsaka acts as Kasyapa instructed him to, and the king indeed recovers.

I thought this was very strange. Does anyone have any insight into what is going on here? Perhaps a commentary in Tibetan says something. Obermiller cites Vinayaksudraka Kg. HDUL. XI. 290-1.

Fwiw.

Wikipedia:
Objectivism is a philosophical system developed by Russian American writer Ayn Rand (1905–1982). Rand first expressed Objectivism in her fiction, most notably The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged (1957), and later in nonfiction essays and books. Leonard Peikoff, a professional philosopher and Rand's designated intellectual heir, later gave it a more formal structure. Peikoff characterizes Objectivism as a "closed system" that is not subject to change.

Objectivism's central tenets are that reality exists independently of consciousness, that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception, that one can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive logic, that the proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness (rational self-interest), that the only social system consistent with this morality is one that displays full respect for individual rights embodied in laissez-faire capitalism, and that the role of art in human life is to transform humans' metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form—a work of art—that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally.

Academic philosophers have mostly ignored or rejected Rand's philosophy. Nonetheless, Objectivism has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives. The Objectivist movement, which Rand founded, attempts to spread her ideas to the public and in academic settings.

Yeah, at first I thought Malcolm's answer was correct in terms of how this mistake crept in. One of the translator's typed in the Tibetan wrong. However, when I typed in the correct Tibetan into an on-line Tib-Eng dictionary yesterday, I also got "musk." So lu-tsi may be a synonym for la-tsi (unless the dictionary is wrong, which also could be). In this case, one needed to know that the lu tsi in the text was not a compound term, but that lu (klu) was an adjective (or possessive).

Malcolm wrote:
Hi.

klu rtsi (ཀླུ་རྩི) is definitely not a synonym for gla rtsi (གླ་རྩི). Synonyms for musk included སྤྲུལ་དུག, poison for snakes; སྦྲུལ་སྐྲག་བྱེད, agent that terrifies snakes. In this case the entry is not in a Tibetan-Tibetan dictionary, but just an erroneous entry in the Valby dictionary.

OK, I think I have the revised translation. On page 18 of the Saraswati Bhawan on-line version, where it says "Musk...", I believe it should read:

Naga plants and healing medicinals, such as
Suitable flat [leaves] and sprouts,

The problem is that one of the translators simply typed into their on-line Tib-Eng dictionary klu rtsi and got the word "musk." Since this person was not conversant with Naga puja and lore, this did not raise a red flag. Since I trusted the translator, I also did not notice this (even though I should have).

However, now I'm wondering if the next line, reading "The patterns of colors of a peacock [feather]," is correct. This does not really fit as a type of healing plant. Perhaps rma bya'i mdongs is the proper Tibetan name of a medicinal herb. Malcolm?

So today I’m performing a public service on behalf of all the voters. I went back and re-read all the criticisms and attacks and best-selling “exposés” leveled at Hillary Rodham Clinton over the past quarter-century. And I’ve compiled a list of all her High Crimes and Misdemeanors.

Here they are:

1. When she was first lady, she murdered White House lawyer Vince Foster and then dumped his body in a park.

2. She drove Vince Foster to commit suicide through her temper tantrums.

3. She was having an affair with Vince Foster.

4. She’s a lesbian.

5. Chelsea isn’t Bill Clinton’s child.

6. She murdered Vince Foster to cover up that she once bought a tract of undeveloped land in Arkansas and lost money.

7. She murdered Vince Foster to cover up her role in firing the White House travel department.

8. After she murdered Vince Foster, she ransacked his office in the middle of the night and stole all the documents proving her guilt.

9. When Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas, she was a partner in the state’s top law firm, and it sometimes did work involving the state government.

10. She once invested in commodities futures on the advice of a friend and made $100,000, proving she’s a crook.

11. She once invested in real estate on the advice of another friend and lost $100,000, also proving she’s a crook.

12. Unnamed and unverifiable sources have told Peggy Noonan things about the Clintons that are simply too terrible to repeat.

13. The personnel murdered at Benghazi make her the first secretary of state to lose overseas personnel to terrorism — apart from Condi Rice, Colin Powell, Madeleine Albright, George Schultz, Dean Rusk and some others.

14. Four State Department staff were murdered at Benghazi, compared with only 119 others murdered overseas under every secretary of state combined since World War II.

15. She illegally sent classified emails from her personal server, except that apparently they weren’t classified at the time.

16. She may have cynically wriggled around the email law by “technically” complying with it.

17. She once signed a lucrative book contract when she was a private citizen.

18. Donald Trump says she “should be in jail,” and he’s a serial bankrupt casino developer in Atlantic City, so he should know.

19. Former House Majority Leader Tom Delay says his “law-enforcement sources” tell him she is “about to be indicted” — and if a man once convicted of money laundering and conspiracy doesn’t have good law-enforcement sources, who does?

20. She’s a hard-left radical who wants to break up the nuclear family.

21. She’s a conservative “mousewife” who refused to break up her own family.

22. She’s in favor of single moms.

23. She refused to be a single mom.

24. When she was first lady of Arkansas, she pandered to conservative voters by dyeing her hair.

25. Before that, she totally insulted them by refusing to.

26. She’s a frump.

27. She spends too much money on designer dresses.

28. She has “cankles.”

29. She has a grating voice.

30. She yells into the microphone.

31. She spent 18 years in Arkansas and some of the people she knew turned out to be crazy rednecks and crooks.

32. She’s in the pay of the mafia.

33. She’s in the pay of the Chinese government.

34. She’s in the pay of the Wall Street banks.

35. In order to suppress the billing records from her time at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, she cleverly packed them up and took them to the White House rather than shredding them.

36. When she handed over the documents to public officials, they couldn’t find any evidence she’d committed any crimes, so she must have doctored them.

37. Congress spent tens of millions of dollars and six years investigating her investment in the Whitewater real-estate project, and, while they didn’t actually find anything, they wouldn’t have spent all that money if there weren’t something there.

38. By cleverly hiding all evidence of her crimes in the Whitewater affair, she caused Congress to waste all that taxpayers’ money.

39. When she ran for senator of New York, she was still a fan of the Chicago Cubs.

40. She once said the Clintons were thinking of adopting a child, and they didn’t follow through.

41. She was photographed holding her hand near her mouth during the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.

42. She’s got brain damage.

43. She’s old.

44. She’s really ambitious and calculating, unlike all the other people running for president.

45. She secretly supported Palestinian terrorists, Puerto Rican terrorists and Guatemalan terrorists.

46. She secretly supported a group that wants to give Maine back to the Indians.

47. She’s a secret follower of “radical prophet” Saul Alinsky.

48. She did her law degree at Yale, and it’s a well-known “socialist finishing school.”

49. When she was young, she did things to build up her résumé rather than just for their own good.

50. When Bill was president, she “allowed” him to keep people waiting.

51. She’s married to a sex addict.

52. She’s an enemy of traditional marriage.

53. She didn’t divorce her husband.

54. His philandering is her fault because she is too strong, and too weak, and too frumpy, and too fat, and too cold.

55. She’s hostile to women who fool around with her husband.

56. A divorced taxi driver in Florida told me that if Hillary is elected president, “women will take over everything.”

57. She insulted Tammy Wynette.

58. When they left the White House, she and Bill bought a big house in New York that they couldn’t afford.

59. She sometimes calls her staff during dinner, even when they’re out at a restaurant.

60. She claimed there was a “vast right-wing conspiracy” against her husband, and it turned out there was nothing but a bunch of tycoons financing private investigators, and some fake think tanks and books and news sites and stuff.

61. When she got married, she didn’t “stay at home and bake cookies.”

62. She supported the Iraq war because she’s a secret foreign-policy conservative.

63. She’s a secret foreign-policy radical with a plan to impose worldwide “radical social experimentation” through the World Bank.

64. She is secretly plotting to let children sue their parents for making them take out the garbage.

65. She looked bored during the Benghazi hearings.

66. Oh, yeah — and she totally has a vagina.

It’s clear: Hillary must be stopped. Hearings now!

tomamundsen said:
The reason now that we place such importance on the outer appearance is a question of bodhicitta rather than of essential necessity. If Buddhism, let alone Vajrayana Buddhism, is to survive in the West - there must be an alternative to the monastic style. Buddhism will never be established even as a minor religion in Western countries as long as there are no clergy apart from monastics. This is why we have to be so scrupulous about our costume and the precise details of the vows involved. This is why we have to insist on uncut hair. Any deviation from the historical model undermines our position completely.

Malcolm wrote:
This sentiment is complete bollocks. There is no set, official Nakpa outfit or hair style. Ngakpas dress a hundred different ways, corresponding with the needs of sentient beings. They can wear three robes, or Gucci suits.

What is important is practicing Dzogchen, not being concerned with one's hair style, clothing, or other relative, secondary accouterments.

Further:

tomamundsen said:
We simply advocate the gö-kar-chang-lo as a way of integrating with life in the West - a way of making working family life a method of practice that can inspire others.

Malcolm wrote:
It is unnecessary, and in fact bizarre, to insist that copying Tibetan clothes is necessary for making family life a method of practice in the West.


tomamundsen said:
until the 11th Century, but thereafter the gö-kar-chang-lo'i-dé began to diminish and female practitioners in particular were forced into the background.

Malcolm wrote:
This is an unsubstantiated (male) fantasy. There is no evidence to support this. One, there is no evidence to support the idea that Ngakpas went into decline following the 11th century. Second, women, when they appear in ancient literature at all, generally appear only as the mothers and wives of important men. I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of female authors in Tibetan Buddhism before the 20th Century, all of them Nyingma.

tomamundsen said:
This was the time when they began to live in remote villages in order to continue their practises. They would live anywhere sufficiently far from the large monastic institutions. It would seem that the disparaging term 'village ngakpa' came from that period, as a way of diminishing respect given to the ngakphang sangha in places where the monasteries had less influence.

Malcolm wrote:
This piece of sociological speculation is also completely unsubstantiated and is not born out by even a superficial observation of Tibetan society. Ngakpa Dratsangs alway operated within close proximity to large Monastic establishments. The exception to this would be Tibetan Lamas who fled local wars with their families and followers and relocated to hidden lands. When established, they would automatically set about reestablishing Monastic Buddhism, monks and all. Oddly enough, the harshest criticism of so-called village Ngakpas (grong sngags pa) are in predictions of Padmasambhava.

Isn't that basically what Nagarjuna said (except for the brahman part) in the Mulamadhyamakakarika?

Malcolm wrote:
No, Nāgārjuna states that dependent origination and emptiness are basically the same thing:

That which originates in dependence is explained as emptiness,
that is a dependent designation, that itself is the middle way.
And:
Whoever rejects the emptiness of dependent origination
is one who rejects all mundane conventions.

And:
Whoever sees dependent origination sees suffering,
the source of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path.
One of the Buddhist criticisms of Advaita is that their presentation of the relative, conventional level is faulty, and therefore, their presentation of the ultimate is consequently faulty.

If brahman has no attributes, therefore is undetectable, how can it be known that it is real?

In my understanding, Advaita's answers to this are:

1. You keep Neti Neti! -ing (rationally denying the ultimate truth of things/appearances) until the Truth (brahman) is all that remains.

2. You trust the word of the Hindu/Advaitan sages who have come to know the Truth with utter certainty.

I will detail it. Mahakala should defend me, he should remove the big hindrances and problems from my life. I don't experience it. Vajrasattva should clean my bad karmas, so i should experience less bad karmas in my present life. I don't experience it. WHY? The only interesting thing was i saw a blue buddha with blue lights around his body. I never saw such buddha before. Then i did a search on the internet with these words "blue buddha" and i saw  the buddha on google, it was very similar like which i saw. Interesting. Another buddha i saw after a meditation was a buddha which sit on lotus and the lotus was on clouds. I saw it for only some second so i didn't really saw the buddha. But i saw the clouds. I did a search on google and sure i saw buddhas who sit on lotus and the lotus was on clouds.... Again, an interesting thing.
My life.... is not better than before. What more, my life is worse now. I lost my job, i got a new job, which is harder than my previous job. My mental illness doesn't change, i spent some days at the psychiatry some months ago. (I have serious schizophrenia and anxiety). Working is very hard to me - though i work only 4 hours daily because i get a money support. My mind is very tired often. I get injection once in a month for cure schizophrenia.
If there are buddhas around me - then why they do not help? Where are they when i am in stress? Why my life doesn't turn into better?

This "quotation" of Buddha probably derives from what he said at the end of the Smaller Sukhavativyuha Sutra. Buddha Shakyamuni says there that he has now achieved a most difficult task by teaching the Dharma of Sukhavati which the whole world is reluctant to believe and reluctant to accept.
There are many versions and/or translations of this sutra in circulation, the above is how I remember it (from 1970's and 1980's). The present version of Jodo Shu Research Institute is slightly different, but not entirely different.

Unless I'm thinking of another section than you, I think what Vasubandhu was mostly asserting is that the guards that dole out the torment within hell don't have actual bodies, because they are not real beings subject to birth and death, but rather are projections manifest from the minds of the beings who were born into hell.

If we take the cittamatra view to be that hell beings have no bodies, we would also have to assert that human beings have no bodies either, wouldn't we? Cittamatra says that form is not independent of the mind, but that doesn't mean that bodies of hell beings are not still manifest of form.

The element of air is one of the four mahābhūtas, and therefore, a body made from the element of air is indeed part of the rupāskandha and is capable of perceiving physical sense objects, which are also part of the rūpaskandha. It is indeed a subtle body, since it is predominantly made of air, but each of the four elements contains the other three elements.

The question that has been bugging me for a while is how such a set of aggregates is held together after the parting of the mind and body. If the sense-fields of the physical body no longer constitute part of the conciousness aggregate, then what is it that keeps the mental body or experience self-contained and personal to that mental continuum? If it's Vayu without the shell of the physical body to be enclosed by, how does it not dissipate into space? Is it like an apparitional self-projected hologram that either recognizes or fails to recognize it's display as baseless?

I need to get to Bardo 101 class.

Malcolm wrote:
The so-called mental body in the bardo is in fact made of the matter of the element of air, as Greg mentioned above. It has complete sense organs and so on, because consciousness and vāyu are inseparable. It is a special point of Dzogchen, in fact, that there are no realms which are utterly devoid of matter, including the formless realms.

It would seem that only the first three links operate in between - ignorance, mental formations, consciousness. Name-and-form would already be birth.

Trump and his campaign have mentioned these right-wing extremists as potential appointees: Rudy Giuliani, Joe Arpaio, Sarah Palin, Ben Carson, Chris Christie and Forrest Lucas, oil executive and animal rights opponent for Department of Interior. Perhaps scariest of all, Myron Ebell, a leading climate-change denier, is expected to head Trump’s EPA. Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov.

Maybe it has something to do with this: The four syllables ( yi-ge bzhi ) tradition, found widely among the various Kagyu lineages, derives from Maitripa, who together with Naropa were the main Indian spiritual teachers of Marpa. It explains mahamudra in terms of the hidden meaning of the four syllables of the Sanskrit word amanasi ( yid-la ma-byed-pa ), which means “not taking to mind” or “not paying attention (incorrectly).” The four syllables connote:
1. cutting down to the foundational root state of the conventional mind,
2. gaining certainty with the methods for quieting and settling the mind in concentration,
3. severing the mind’s connection with points where it can deviate into conceptual cognition of true existence and into destructive states,
4. transforming the mind into the nature of pathways of deep awareness.

Big thanks to everyone who participated in this thread! Here's the main thing I learned from it:

If you pluck a teaching from the body of dharma teachings without understanding its context (Buddhist school, lineage, time period, etc.) no matter how much this teaching resonates with you (as Tilopa does with me) you run the risk of misunderstanding the context therefore missing the exact message the teacher intended to communicate, all of which could hamper your personal progress to realization.

It's a good lesson for me to learn. But, just so you know, my take on realization is perhaps a bit different from the conventional Buddhist take. (I am not a Buddhist, but deeply appreciate some Buddhist teachings.) I think realization is our birthright ... built into the package of being human. And I think "the other shore" is the same other shore regardless of what method one ends up taking to get there: swimming, snorkeling, rafting, surfing, flying, perhaps even walking on water ... I see Tilopa's advices as instructions for building and navigating a certain kind of raft. If I misinterpret them (in terms of his intended meaning), then I end up with a different raft. But different doesn't mean useless ... or perhaps not even inferior. It's just ... different, Tilopa's intended meaning filtered through me. So I don't mind the potential misunderstanding so much, in fact I kind of welcome it, I feel it gives me room to be creative with applying the teaching to my path.

Well, there is always Dombhi Heruka's Four Syllables:

Namo Guruve. 
The Intimate Instruction of the Great Bliss of Dharma
There are three essences, four commitments, three deviations and four methods of resting.
The three essences: Effortlessness
Without contrivance
Everything that occurs is understood as one's own mind.
The four commitments: Afflictions are not abandoned because they are one's mind. 
Antidotes are not relied upon because the mind is non-dual. 
The true nature is not meditated upon because mind is without grasping.
A result is not hoped for, realizing the mind itself is Buddhahood.
The three deviations: If there is hope for Buddhahood, it is a deviation.
If there is fear towards Samsara, it is a deviation.
If there is attachment to appearances, it is a deviation.
The four methods of resting: Just like the limpid quality of water when it is undisturbed, rest relaxed in uncontrived mind.
Just as a bird in the sky leaves no tracks, consciousness rests without support.
Just like the sun not concealed by clouds, rest in one’s own unobstructed state relaxing into the objects of the six sense organs.
Just like water always falling, rest undistracted at all times and in all activities.

As he was sitting there, he addressed the monks: "For what topic of conversation are you gathered together here? In the midst of what topic of conversation have you been interrupted?"

"Just now, lord, after the meal, on returning from our alms round, we gathered at the meeting hall and got engaged in many kinds of bestial topics of conversation: conversation about kings, robbers, & ministers of state; armies, alarms, & battles; food & drink; clothing, furniture, garlands, & scents; relatives; vehicles; villages, towns, cities, the countryside; women & heroes; the gossip of the street & the well; tales of the dead; tales of diversity, the creation of the world & of the sea; talk of whether things exist or not."

"It isn't right, monks, that sons of good families, on having gone forth out of faith from home to the homeless life, should get engaged in such topics of conversation, i.e., conversation about kings, robbers, & ministers of state... talk of whether things exist or not.

"There are these ten topics of [proper] conversation. Which ten? Talk on modesty, on contentment, on seclusion, on non-entanglement, on arousing persistence, on virtue, on concentration, on discernment, on release, and on the knowledge & vision of release. These are the ten topics of conversation. If you were to engage repeatedly in these ten topics of conversation, you would outshine even the sun & moon, so mighty, so powerful — to say nothing of the wanderers of other sects."

Malcolm wrote:
To be a deep ecologist, one merely has to subscribe the eight-point platform. I don't recall seeing a requirement for belief in rebirth and karma included.

The Deep Ecology Platform

1. The well-being and flourishing of human and nonhuman life on Earth have value in themselves (synonyms: inherent worth, intrinsic value, inherent value). These values are independent of the usefulness of the nonhuman world for human purposes.

2. Richness and diversity of life forms contribute to the realization of these values and are also values in themselves.

3. Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital needs.

4. Present human interference with the nonhuman world is excessive, and the situation is rapidly worsening.

5. The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantial decrease of the human population. The flourishing of nonhuman life requires such a decrease.

6. Policies must therefore be changed. The changes in policies affect basic economic, technological, and ideological structures. The resulting state of affairs will be deeply different from the present.

7. The ideological change is mainly that of appreciating life quality (dwelling in situations of inherent worth) rather than adhering to an increasingly higher standard of living. There will be a profound awareness of the difference between big and great.

8. Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation directly or indirectly to participate in the attempt to implement the necessary changes.

I don't disagree with any of that, but I think it's insufficient as a philosophical framework.

My issue with various secular approaches is that secularists refuse to or are unable to teach people how to find ultimate satisfaction in what in dharmic terms would be considered sensual or worldly pursuits. (Schumacher had to turn to religion.)

I once bought a camera; it came with a user manual and one of the sections of the manual said "Learn how to enjoy presentations". Well, the manual didn't teach how to enjoy presentations, it just taught how to make them. I felt betrayed. It didn't deliver what it promised. This same experience repeats with so many secular propositions for how to find worth and meaning in this world and in worldly pursuits: they don't deliver.

Sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations, and ideas are fleeting and so are the pleasures that come with them. This is undeniable, and people do know that, even if just intuitively.
Yes, trees, meadows, clean rivers, giraffes etc. etc. are beautiful, but the pleasures one gets from them are fleeting, and therefore cannot serve as a reliable foundation for changing one's attitude to life and the world.

Title: Re: Deep Ecology

Unknown said:
1. Left biocentrism is a left focus or theoretical tendency within the
deep ecology movement, which is subversive of the existing industrial
society. It accepts and promotes the eight-point Deep Ecology Platform
drawn up by Arne Naess and George Sessions. Left biocentrism holds up
as an ideal, identification, solidarity, and compassion  with all life. "Left"
as used in left biocentrism, means anti-industrial and anti-capitalist, but
not necessarily socialist. The expressions 'left biocentrism' or 'left
ecocentrism' are used interchangeably.


2. Left biocentrism accepts the view that the Earth belongs to no one.
While raising a number of criticisms, left biocentrism is meant to
strengthen, not undermine, the deep ecology movement which identifies
with all life.


3. Left biocentrism says that individuals must take responsibility for
their actions and be socially accountable. Part of being individually
responsible is to practice voluntary simplicity, so as to minimize one's
own impact upon the Earth.


4. Left biocentrists are concerned with social justice and class issues,
but within a context of ecology. To move to a deep ecology world, the
human species must be mobilized, and a concern for social justice is a
necessary part of this mobilization. Left biocentrism is for the
redistribution of wealth, nationally and internationally.


5. Left biocentrism opposes economic growth and consumerism.
Human societies must live within ecological limits so that all other
species may continue to flourish. We believe that bioregionalism,
not globalism, is necessary for sustainability. The perspective of the
late German Green philosopher Rudolf Bahro is accepted that, for
world-wide sustainability, industrialized countries need to reduce
their impact upon the Earth to about one tenth of what it is at the
present time. It is also incumbent upon non-industrialized nations to
become sustainable and it is necessary for industrialized nations to
help on this path.


6. Left biocentrism holds that individual and collective spiritual
transformation is important to bring about major social change, and to
break with industrial society. We need inward transformation, so that
the interests of all species override the short-term self-interest of the
individual, the family, the community, and the nation.


7. Left biocentrism believes that deep ecology must be applied to
actual environmental issues and struggles, no matter how socially
sensitive, e.g. population reduction, aboriginal issues, workers'
struggles, etc.


8. Social ecology, eco-feminism and eco-marxism, while raising
important questions, are all human-centered and consider human-to-
human relations within society to be more important and, in the final
analysis, determine society's relationship to the natural world. Left
biocentrism believes that an egalitarian, non-sexist, non-discriminating
society, a highly desirable goal, can still be exploitive towards the Earth.


9. Left biocentrists are "movement greens" in basic orientation. They
are critical of existing Green political parties, which have come to an
accommodation with industrial society and have no accountability to the
deep ecology movement.


10. To be politically relevant, deep ecology needs to incorporate the
perspective advanced by left biocentrism.

It would take a lot to create a real alternative economic model. I think one of the many enormous structural problems, is that consumerism and endless growth and the stimulation of desire is essential to the capitalist model. Imagine if you had a model where the ideal was 'cultivation of wisdom'? It is actually hard to imagine - but I suppose that is one of the ideas behind a classical book in this tradition, Schumacher's 'Small is Beautiful'. It would take more than a different economic model, more like a very different mentality.  Actually, I guess Schumacher is a good model in this area.  I admit, I haven't done a lot of study about these things. (I have got The Value of Nothing, by Raj Patel, and I think I have Prosperity without Growth here somewhere.)

I guess, to be honest, I would actually be in a position to get 'off the grid' if I converted all my city equity into a country freehold (I'm in one of the most expensive cities in the world to own property, as it happens). But, wife is totally against such ideas.

Malcolm wrote:
The fundamental difference in approach is that shallow environmentalism seeks to maintain the industrial, capitalist, growth-oriented, market economy status quo.

Deep ecology is by definition anti-capitalist, anti-industrialist, and anti-class . To be a deep ecologist then is to consistently act in ways which foster the eventual elimination of capitalism, industrial civilization and class.

David Foreman's views on immigration, for example, are shallow inso far as they reinforce class distinctions by refusing to allow indigenous people impoverished by NAFTA from crossing into the USA on the excuse that "more people = more land degradation."

Forman's chief error, like his guru's Edward Abbey, is assuming there was ever a "wild" America. We know that Native People in the Americas systematically managed their environment in a manner which fostered the diversity and health of the ecosystem (after they systematically hunted American megafauna into extinction). The forest fires we experience regularly in the West are chiefly a result of shallow environmental practices which assumed an unpopulated primeval wilderness through which humans moved lightly, if at all.

And of course it is well known that Edward Abbey was a complete racist, whose views on ecology are anything but deep:

The point, in this election, is not who we put into office (anyone is better than Trump), the point is to keep Trump out of the White House. This can only be effectively done by voting for Clinton.

No, deep and shallow refer to respective approaches within the environmental movement. The late David Orton writes:


Sherab Dorje said:
The distinction between “shallow” and “deep” ecology made by Naess, although perhaps an invidious comparison which some have called self-serving, nevertheless became a signature and part of the language of ecophilosophy and radical environmentalism. In fairness to Naess, he saw these two terms as “argumentation patterns” and not applied to people. (_Philosophical Dialogues: Arne Naess and the Progress of Ecophilosophy_, p. 444.) What is being called for in this age of ecology is that individuals need to define their “selves” as being part of the natural world. Naess defined the shallow ecology movement, which he says is more influential than the deep ecology movement, as “Fight against pollution and resource depletion. Central objective: the health and affluence of people in the developed countries.” The shallow approach takes for granted beliefs in technological optimism, economic growth, and scientific management and the continuation of existing industrial societies. Naess expressed it this way: “The supporters of shallow ecology think that reforming human relations toward nature can be done within the existing structure of society.” (_Selected Works_, Volume Ten, p. 16.)

Naess defined the “deep movement”, which seeks the transformation of industrial capitalist societies who have brought about the existing environmental crisis, by putting forward seven main points. The article is only a few pages long, but profound and showing the complexity of Naess. He pointed out that biological complexity required a corresponding social and cultural complexity. Outlined is an “anti-class posture” and how anti-pollution devices can, because of increasing the “prices of life necessities” increase class differences. He stressed local autonomy and decentralization.

As a mountaineer who had climbed all over the world, Naess had enjoyed the opportunity to observe political and social activism in diverse cultures. Both historically and in the contemporary movement, Naess saw two different forms of environmentalism, not necessarily incompatible with each other. One he called the “long-range deep ecology movement” and the other, the “shallow ecology movement.” The word “deep” in part referred to the level of questioning of our purposes and values when arguing in environmental conflicts. The “deep” movement involves deep questioning, right down to fundamental root causes. The short-term, shallow approach stops before the ultimate level of fundamental change, often promoting technological fixes (e.g. recycling, increased automotive efficiency, export-driven monocultural organic agriculture) based on the same consumption-oriented values and methods of the industrial economy. The long-range deep approach involves redesigning our whole systems based on values and methods that truly preserve the ecological and cultural diversity of natural systems.

This part of the conversation began when I noted that the failure of the Green Party is rooted in two things: 1) it's abandonment of a deep ecological framework (at least this is clearly the case with the dominant Green Party in the US) and 2) its subsequent adoption of Ecosocialism, which is purely green-washed old school Marxism.

Yeah i have no problem with that. I'm in agreement with Naess in that all three movements need to occur side by side. That of social justice, that of peace and that of the 'deep ecology movement.'

My "issue' is simply the insistence on the self-proclaimed name of 'deep-ecology' as the definitive title of that third movement. The name and ethos evolved from the enviriomental movement in general and not the other way around. If you asked your average person if they simply knew of the existence of the enviromental movement, most would say yes. If you asked your average person if they knew of the existence of the deep ecology movement, most would say no. Deep ecology is a species of the enviriomental movement and not the other way around. Enviriomental movements might have different ideologies but some will still remain consistent with the praxis of D.E and you can still effectively advocate for meaningful ecological progress without the need to lump things under a single title.

It would just be a case of 'a rose by any other name smelling just as sweet' if the deep ecology movement was synonymous with all forms of environmentalism but that doesn't seem to be so. Equally, there are thousands of enviriomental initiatives that are in alignment with the D.E view but have no association with them.

People are less concerned with the titles of movements and of the various 'isms' and nore conceened with whether they actually function.


Malcolm wrote:
It is a matter of perspective, mainly:

Vasana said:
You’ve been credited with having coined the expression “deep ecology.” How exactly did the idea originate?
Well, I did not coin the term “deep ecology.” I coined two terms. One is “supporter of the deep ecology movement” – a fairly long expressions. And the other is “ecosophy.” But this term “supporter of the deep ecology movement” was very soon abbreviated to “deep ecology” and supporters were called “deep ecologists.”

How does “deep” ecology differ from “shallow” ecology?

Movements are always changing and one should be cautious in saying what strictly separates two movements, like the deep and the shallow. One marked difference is that the total argumentations of those who support the shallow movement are anthropocentric in the sense that everything done to protect and restore nature sis seen as having benefit for future human generations. In deep ecology, future generations means future generations of all living beings, including rivers for example.

I was inspired to make this thread after reading a passage in Not For Happiness by Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche, in which he says:

There will also be times when none of the usual logic works and you find yourself incapable of accepting even the most patently obvious truth that death is imminent and inevitable, and not one living being—friend, family or even you yourself—can escape it. When such stubborn delusions take hold of your mind, pray to your guru, the buddhas and the bodhisattvas and beg them for help truly to accept the inexorability of death. And don’t fall into the trap of imagining you should first learn to despise samsara and develop strong “renunciation mind” before you resort to such a prayer. As the great Jamgön Kongtrul Lodrö Tayé said, you should rely on your guru for everything, including the blessing of no longer hungering for samsara. In fact, you should pray to your guru and ask him to make sure that you pray!

This passage gives me the idea that praying to guru the activates some sort of force that helps you along the path. The force could be coming from outside of you, or it could be a matter of psyching yourself up to unlock your hidden potential.

Statements from some of the Earth First!ers would give you the impression that the whole species is screwed up, but again, I think this is a minority dimension.

Vasana said:
About another misunderstanding: what is your feeling about those who have used ecology to defend social Darwinism or Malthusianism? For example, David Foreman of Earth First! has been quoted as saying with regard to the Ethiopian famine, “The best thing would be to just let nature seek its own balance, to let the people there just starve.”

Dave Foreman sometimes seems to speak without much carefulness and sometimes he’s then quoted even less carefully making these statements. The only thing I can find there which can be said to be a supportable view is the opinion of many doctors who are treating Ethiopian starving children, when they say – not publicly – but when they say that the best thing for may of these children would be to die. But of course we cannot let them die. We have to, as physicians, try to heal them. Also because of the parents, we cannot let children die. Dave Foreman may have the opinion that it would be best for starving people to die, but ecological humanitarian norms among humans are such that we are extremely concerned about starvation. We have more responsibility toward humans than we do toward animals. If someone had to choose between saving a starving child and the possibility of killing the last rhinoceros, if there were no other means of saving the child, he should kill the rhinoceros and we would all think that correct. But it would be a scandal, especially among rich nations, not to help the poorer nations let living beings continue to live. In short, we are not social Darwinists.

Malcolm wrote:
And this is an important clarification by Naess:

Vasana said:
Would deep ecology preclude concern for the issues of social justice, which have become part of the agenda of left Greens?

No, I think that in this century we have three great grassroots movements: that of social justice, that of peace and that of the deep ecology movement. Those three have to cooperate intimately. It’s quite clear that the ecological crisis cannot be solved in isolation from social justice – for instance, to try to conserve rainforests without at the same time taking up the tremendous problem of what to do with relations between North and South. We have to take those problems – all of them – at once, and not say that one is more important than the others. So it’s extremely important that the social justice movement is always taken into consideration. The peace movement is too obvious to talk about at all. The military – 900 billion dollars used every year for militarism – is one of the greatest polluters in the present day. Also any kind of warlike situation immediately tends to negate every kind of concern not only for civilians but for all living beings whatsoever. So those three movements must cooperate. What distinguishes the deep ecology movements is that it is practically 100% a grassroots movement, whereas the other two have some support among the governments.

What do you think are our realistic prospects for the future – for humankind?
There will be no ultimate catastrophe involving all humanity or involving all higher organisms on the earth. But there may be a deterioration in the quality of life both in and outside cities. And there will be hundreds of catastrophes on the order of Chernobyl. I look forward to this trend changing in the 22nd century, at the earliest.
