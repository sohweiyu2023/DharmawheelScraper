There are two so called Prasangika views: the original one introduced to Tibet by Jayananda and his translator, Patsab Nyima Drag in the 12th century, and the later reformulation introduced by Tsongkhapa.

The differences in the view between the original formulators of the distinction, prasanga and svatantra, only referred to how emptiness was to be taught, not in any substantial difference in view of ultimate truth. The notion that there substantial differences in ultimate truth between the two approaches is a novelty introduced by Tsongkhapa.

Herbie said:
Then I have to add another meaning of the expression " inherent existence does not exist conventionally " which follows from the fact that the existence of phenomena/objects depends on imputation by individuals:
There are "common" objects only considering the merely linguistic means of expression in that a community uses the same language. However the formation of concepts is an individual matter because concept is the combination of "word + idea ". So while people of one linguistic community use the same words the ideas associated with these words vary on the level of individuals, inter-individually. And since all objects/phenomena only exist dependent on conceptual imputation there are actually no completely "common" objects because of the inter-individual variations in concept formation.
That is why " inherent existence does not exist conventionally " is often used to differentiate the Prasangika view from Svatantrika view because in Svatantrika philosophy it is assumed that when people use the same linguistical designator (word) the object which appears to all of them individually is identical. But this cannot be the case from a Prasangika perspective because that would presume inherent existence of the object discussed by several individuals, i.e. existence of the object by way of its own objective character independent of each individual's conceptual imputation.

Astus said:
One is either a buddha, completely free from ignorance, or not. I think that's a fairly mainstream position even in the gradual paths. Similarly, if one has attained any level of nobility, there is no way back from that, as it includes permanent eradication of some defilements. Consequently, one has either realised the nature of mind, the dharmakaya, or not. That does not mean one cannot have concepts about the nature of mind, and even correct views.

Malcolm wrote:
And this, Astus, is the crux of the problem. Realizing emptiness is not realizing "dharmakāya." The realization of the dharmakāya is attended by the twin omniscience concerning the nature of what exists and all that exists. Now, if you wish to redefine, or dumb down, dharmakāya to make it seem more attainable, I can't stop you. But it is an error to do so.

Malcolm wrote:
What is direct perception when there is no common inter-individual object as in prasangika?
Supposedly, according to the Gelug system, the absence of inherent existence is the nominal ultimate, which is cultivated in order to lead to the yogic direction perception of emptiness. But nominal ultimates are necessarily conceptual, and are sustained through a conceptual awareness.

It is a  mere concept, like the color grue, which is entirely conceptual in nature.

Then why are you negating the fact that your "absence of inherent existence" is merely a concept? You are being self-contradictory [as usual]. Further, you are not making a distinction between that which is absolutely false, such as grue, or inherent existence, and that which is conventionally true, such as blue-green or existence.

Unknown said:
It cannot even be perceived via exclusion [since inherent existence does not conventionally exist].

Malcolm wrote:
inherent existence actually conventionally exists because people think it to inhere in objects of perception.
No, inherent existence does not exist even conventionally. If it did, Tsongkhapa would not have negated it, because it would be an over-negation. The reason why Tsongkhapa negates inherent existence rather than existence is because the former does not exist even conventionally, while the latter does.

Your point seems to be that afflictions need to be fully eliminated first, and only then one has attained full enlightenment. But Huineng says:

"If one [tries to] use the illumination of wisdom to destroy the afflictions, this is the interpretation of the two [Hinayana] vehicles [held by] those fit for the sheep and deer [carts]. ... Ordinary people see brightness and ignorance as different, but the wise comprehend that they are nondual in their nature. ... One abides in the afflictions without disruption; one resides in meditation without serenity. Not annihilationist and not permanent, neither coming nor going; neither located in an intermediate location nor in the internal and external; neither generated nor extinguished, permanently abiding without movement—this is called the Way."

The inseparable clarity and emptiness of the mind is regarded as ultimate. Mipham explains very clearly in Original Mind:
Beyond the extremes of conditioned and unconditioned, in the true stage of things, an emptiness devoid of luminosity cannot be perceived and a luminous mind devoid of emptiness cannot be perceived. When those two are realized as the objects of a personal knowledge of the realization of the true state, they are realized to be inseparable. If it is not realized, since the theoretical understanding arising in the mind that there is an empty object which is the demarcation of an object of refutation through exclusion and a subjective consciousness that possesses signs does not go beyond grasping signified phenomena that are conceptual objects of dualistic appearances as being real or unreal, it is not the true state. If the true state, original mind, is actualized, there will be personal knowledge of the nondual dharmatā that goes beyond the domain of all dualistic phenomena such as real or unreal, empty or not empty, and so on. [20/a] In that case, the division of emptiness, luminosity, knowing and emptiness, appearance and emptiness into dualities are mere expressions that does not stay in the partial extremes because of subsequent concepts, but there is no duality in the true state. Likewise, it is beyond all dualistic phenomena such as subject, object, and so on...Apart from actualizing this on the basis of the intimate instruction of the liberating method that possesses the yoga, it is not an object of analysis with intellectual knowledge. Therefore, it is valid to have confidence in those who have ascertained their own minds are nonarising. However, only foolish children assert that unconditioned sole emptiness turned into an object with the conditioned mind is the true state. Since not even a semblance of personal knowledge arises, since nothing is able to arising in the mind other than that, since one can be seduced by turning it into a conceptual tenet, give up looking in that direction. It is necessary to hear the instruction of the profound aural lineage from the mouth of the sublime vidyādhara gurus who follow the tenets of the Great Perfection or Mahāmudra.

Sorry folks but I have some more questions.

From what I've seen in the thread there are obviously levels of practice which one goes through after ordination. So with that in mind is it fair to assume that even ordained practitioners have continual training and a teacher?

DGA said:
Yes.

In Tendai-shu (this may be generalized across all Japanese traditions, but I'm not certain), one is ordained first, and then trained afterward.  Ordination in this case isn't like a diploma.  It's what you do when you first start out.  The kinds of training one will be expected to engage in varies from tradition to tradition, and also from temple to temple within traditions.

Malcolm wrote:
In Tibet, receiving the three vows [Hinyāna, Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna] are not considered ordinations [aside from ordaining (pravajyā) as a novice or fully ordained monk or nun] at all. And all three come with any empowerment one might attend.

In one traditional Zen Buddhist take on the 10 Bhumis, all are realized at once in the Emptiness of a moment of sudden realization or in a moment of Zazen. Since there was no where to get, and the ladder was Empty, the 10 Bhumis are Empty. As Taigen Dan Leighton notes on Dogen and the appearance of the underground Bodhisattvas in the Lotus Sutra ...

It appears to me that in some quarters, there is an excessive commitment in Zen/Chan to a rhetoric of immediacy, to borrow Faure's term, which results in a rather pyrrhic discourse of "all or nothingism" by people who have realized nothing at all. Not a single one of us is in reality a Buddha, and I find it odd that people without a single shred of noble realization present themselves as authorities on a buddhahood [i.e. Zen masters] they have never experienced.

In Korean Zen there is a still continuing debate about Sudden Enlightenment/Gradual Cultivation vs. Sudden  Enlightenment/Sudden Cultivation.

Malcolm wrote:
These controversies are nonissues, and they exist in Tibetan Buddhism as well, most notably in Dzogchen, where we argue that the result that does not come from a cause, buddhahood does not come from mind, and our intimate instruction does not come from a text [because it is based on direct perception].

The issue boils down to capacity of an individual practitioner, and no abstract theory can make someone a buddha. The real point in having these kinds of discussions is to make it clear that theories are not practice. The sudden awakening theory of Huineng is fine, but the kind of people who fully awaken in an instant are quite rare — as it was observed by a 12 century Dzogchen master, he looked high and low for a cig char wa, a suddenly enlightened buddha, but apart from the founder of Mahāmudra in India, Saraha, and the founder of the Drugpa Kagyu lineage, Ling Repa, he never met anyone who he could say was fully awakened, a buddha, suddenly. Such people are as rare as stars seen at noon. 

I personally have no issue with the notion of someone attaining full awakening in an instant [the doctrine the Lanka is actually famous for and the reason it should be considered the foundational document of Chan], cutting through both obscurations at once, I merely doubt that it happens very frequently, maybe as frequently as an udumbara flower blossoms. In other words Chan rhetoric is fine, but I don't think the rhetoric matches people's practice.

So "initial awakenings" are hardly denied, but not defined as true awakening by this group. At this point, the real debate with the Chinul influenced Sudden Enlightenment/Gradual Cultivation school begins, but is far too sophisticated for my pay grade, especially as it makes little difference in actual training (the most famous modern advocate of Sudden Enlightenment/Sudden Cultivation was known for his exceptionally hard post-enlightenment practice) and seems more of an "ontological" concern than a soteriological.

Meido said:
Nice, thank you.

Something overlooked in these discussions perhaps is that kind of fluidity with which the two supposedly rigidly opposed camps actually approach practice. For example post-kensho practice in Rinzai practice could be called gradual from one standpoint, but is actually experienced in terms of sudden leap-overs. The 5 Ranks are commonly considered a map of graduated progression, but within the practice tradition they're engaged with primarily as different ways of expressing realization, not as grades or steps.

Oral instruction - either living, or preserved in writings not publicly shared - is still a crucial part (to my mind, the crucial part) of what actually goes on in much of Zen.

Temicco said:
It does indeed, but there's a couple things I think should be considered here.

In my eyes, Chan doesn't make a big deal out of obscurations like Vajrayana seems to. In sudden enlightenment, sudden cultivation schools (the orthodox Chan position), the only enlightenment discussed is anuttara samyak sambodhi. There's nothing to do after enlightenment; no obscurations to remove. Gradualist systems are acknowledged as valid, but the classical Chan position itself is vehemently sudden and utterly complete. Recognizing the nature of mind is said to be sufficient for this aim. As such, Chan is less concerned about discussing these defilements than Vajrayana seems to be. So outside the sutras (which Chan has a love-hate relationship with anyway), defilements are only really talked about when it comes to how students should conduct themselves.

Astus, what Huineng says is nothing special. The realization of a first stage bodhisattva is the same wisdom a Buddha fully realizes. The difference between an ārya bodhisattva and buddha is whether or not that realization is sustained 24/7/365. Bodhisattvas have equipoise and post-equiopoise phases, where they may still act out afflictively. Buddhas are only in equipoise.

What accounts for this is that veil of twin obscurations a bodhisattva must burn away with diligent practice, and of course, in every lifetime, bodhisattvas on the impure stages regress completely to the level of common persons, and need to begin again, albeit, advancing more rapidly. It is only when they reach the eighth bhumi that this regression ceases and they attain power over birth.

It’s a lot like dreaming. So, to use a dream as an example, when you start to dream, the dream begins as a thought, like one you would have in the daytime. But you’re asleep, so the thought intensifies and becomes something like talk or gossip, and then the gossip intensifies or solidifies into images, and then you really think that you’re seeing people, seeing places, going places, and so on. And that is how it works with conventional appearances as well.
Is there a more detailed explanation of this process available anywhere?

Malcolm wrote:
Astus, what Huineng says is nothing special. The realization of a first stage bodhisattva is the same wisdom a Buddha fully realizes. The difference between an ārya bodhisattva and buddha is whether or not that realization is sustained 24/7/365. Bodhisattvas have equipoise and post-equiopoise phases, where they may still act out afflictively. Buddhas are only in equipoise.

What accounts for this is that veil of twin obscurations a bodhisattva must burn away with diligent practice, and of course, in every lifetime, bodhisattvas on the impure stages regress completely to the level of common persons, and need to begin again, albeit, advancing more rapidly. It is only when they reach the eighth bhumi that this regression ceases and they attain power over birth.


Ignorance sustains them and prajñā eliminates them, but it is not the case that prajñā can eliminate all the traces sustained by ignorance in a single moment. This is why there are nine grades of affliction — from course-course to subtle-subtle— that need to be removed gradually, after one has realized emptiness on the path of seeing.

Astus said:
That is, in the role of wisdom eliminating ignorance there is no disagreement.

"You must realize that there is fundamentally no distinction between the buddha natures of the foolish and the wise—it is only because of delusion and enlightenment that [you think they are] different and that there are foolish and wise."
(Platform Sutra, ch 2, BDK Edition, p 28)

So this is where we get really into the Zen part then, i.e. sudden enlightenment. Because Huineng also says (p 30):

"To be enlightened to this Dharma is the Dharma of prajñā, to cultivate this practice is the practice of prajñā. To not cultivate this is to be an ordinary [unenlightened] person. To cultivate this in a single moment of thought is to be equivalent to the Buddha in one’s own body."
And (p 31): "To use wisdom to contemplate all the dharmas without grasping or rejecting is to see the nature and accomplish the enlightenment of buddhahood."
Also (p 33): "If you recognize the self-nature, with a single [experience of] enlightenment you will attain the stage of buddhahood."

And a clear description of what this Dharma is (p 33-34):

"in wisdom’s contemplation both interior and exterior are clearly penetrated, and one recognizes one’s own fundamental mind. If you recognize your fundamental mind, this is the fundamental emancipation. And if you attain emancipation, this is the samādhi of prajñā, this is nonthought. What is nonthought? If in seeing all the dharmas, the mind is not defiled or attached, this is nonthought. [The mind’s] functioning pervades all locations, yet it is not attached to all the locations. Just purify the fundamental mind, causing the six consciousnesses to emerge from the six [sensory] gates, [causing one to be] without defilement or heterogeneity within the six types of sensory data (literally, the “six dusts”), autonomous in the coming and going [of mental phenomena], one’s penetrating function without stagnation. ... to be enlightened to the Dharma of nonthought is for the myriad dharmas to be completely penetrated. To be enlightened to the Dharma of nonthought is to see the realms of [all] the buddhas. To be enlightened to the Dharma of nonthought is to arrive at the stage of buddhahood."

"What these observations add up to is that Marxists, revolutionary syndicalists, and authentic anarchists all have a fallacious understanding of politics, which should be conceived as the civic arena and the institutions by which people democratically and directly manage their community affairs. Indeed the Left has repeatedly mistaken statecraft for politics by its persistent failure to understand that the two are not only radically different but exist in radical tension—in fact, opposition—to each other.6 As I have written elsewhere, historically politics did not emerge from the state—an apparatus whose professional machinery is designed to dominate and facilitate the exploitation of the citizenry in the interests of a privileged class. Rather, politics, almost by definition, is the active engagement of free citizens in the handling their municipal affairs and in their defense of its freedom. One can almost say that politics is the “embodiment” of what the French revolutionaries of the 1790s called civicisme. Quite properly, in fact, the word politics itself contains the Greek word for “city” or polis, and its use in classical Athens, together with democracy, connoted the direct governing of the city by its citizens. Centuries of civic degradation, marked particularly by the formation of classes, were necessary to produce the state and its corrosive absorption of the political realm."

It is my contention that Communalism is the overarching political category most suitable to encompass the fully thought out and systematic views of social ecology, including libertarian municipalism and dialectical naturalism.8 As an ideology, Communalism draws on the best of the older Left ideologies—Marxism and anarchism, more properly the libertarian socialist tradition—while offering a wider and more relevant scope for our time. From Marxism, it draws the basic project of formulating a rationally systematic and coherent socialism that integrates philosophy, history, economics, and politics. Avowedly dialectical, it attempts to infuse theory with practice. From anarchism, it draws its commitment to antistatism and confederalism, as well as its recognition that hierarchy is a basic problem that can be overcome only by a libertarian socialist society.9

The term for "wife" is "chung ma," "little lady." And it even so, it was really only the bdag chens, the great lords, for whom weddings were really performed.

Now then, Gelugpas are excellent scholars, and they love to debate. But their blindspot is revering Tsongkhapa so much that they deliberately ignore the many places where he directly contradicts Nāgārjuna, etc.

While I can sympathize with the above, the situation described in the book you presented us with precisely outlines why it is important to make a distinction between Mahāyāna ordinands and Hinayāna ordinands, as well as Mahāyāna vows and Hinayāna vows (In fact, Vajrayāna vows are completely outside the scope of this discussion, and the attempt to involve Vajrayāna in this discussion is disingenuous).

The fact is that in terms of the three kinds of vows, bhikṣu and bhikṣuni, śrāmanera and śrāmanerika and upāsaka and upāsika, the first are the foremost. The bodhisattva vows are necessarily based on any of these three, but if one does not have bhikṣu or śrāmanera vows (or bhikṣuni and śrāmanerika vows), one may be a fantastic Mahāyāna practitioner, but one will never be included in the ordained (pravrajyā, lit. homeless) sangha since one will not meet be basic requirements of renunciation required for being a member of the ordained sangha, no matter how fancy one's robes are, whether one shaves one's head or not, or recites sūtras for "lay" people.

So, as I said above, you're stuck in the back of the bus with us regular unordained folks, Jundo. Better get used to our unwashed smell. We'll let you sit in front of us, but behind the five year old śrāmanera.

This is an interesting thought experiment.  What would happen if all Buddhist practitioners did as you say here, and adopted in all sincerity and with the intention to be helpful the labels they find most suitable?  Put differently:  What if after spending some time reading the Shobogenzo and reflecting on its meaning and practicing zazen to the best of my ability I decide to call myself a Soto Zen master, and start ordaining my own disciples?  I'm spreading the Dharma in this hypothetical situation, and that's good, right?

Malcolm wrote:
Based on Jundo's own statement, he would have absolutely no intrinsic or legal right to challenge your authority, authenticity or right to deem yourself a "Soto Zen master." But I am quite sure he would denounce you in no uncertain terms as a pretender.

I don't think anyone holds the trademark on the name "Soto Zen" in the US. The person who holds that trademark could conceivably bar anyone in the US from referring to themselves by that appellation.

BTW, Jundo, it is ironic that someone who uses this as a mission statement, " We intend to expand and develop our awareness of the ways we are conditioned to separate ourselves by socioeconomic class, nationality, race, age, creed, gender, sexual orientation, physical ability and other forms of identity," has been found to be so wrapped up in an identity. Conditioned much?

I just don't believe that apart from the five vows that all upāsakas maintain (theoretically), that your bodhisattva vows put you on the same level as a fully ordained bhikṣu in any of three surviving ordination lineages.

Some will argue, perhaps correctly, perhaps not, that someone with bodhisattvas vows who is lay person is superior to someone who holds only bhikṣu vows, and certainly in Mahāyāna, we maintain that the realization of a first stage bodhisattva, or even someone who has newly minted bodhisattva aspiration is far superior even to an arhat, but as I have exhaustively explained, in the wider community of Buddhadharma, where there are hundreds of thousands of fully ordained monks, the conceit that Japanese monastics of any stripe hold vows equivalent to a fully ordained bhiḳsu will just be met with tolerant disagreement.

Finally, I do not believe you actually possess the necessary scholarship or realization to challenge even the views of lower tantra, let alone the pinnacle of all Buddhadharma, Atiyoga. But you may try, if you feel up to it. But first I think you need to learn something about it. Maybe you should start with Tendai Mikkyo or Shingon, and work your way up from there.

It is an issue of distinguishing the three sets of vows, Hinayāna, Mahāyāna and Mantrayāna.

As such, there are Mulasarvastivadin Vinayadharas, Dharmaguptaka Vinayadharas, and Theravadin Vinayadharas. These are the people who have the proper authority to ordain monks, i.e. śramaṇeras or bhikṣus

All other ordinations outside of these are Mahāyāna ordinations, and their recipients who have not received śramaṇera or bhikṣu ordinations are upāsakas, lay people.

Unfortunately, most Westerners who decide to follow Zen are completely ignorant of these things, and upon shaving their heads, wrongly imagine that they are "bhikṣus", beggars, even though they marry, drink, and raise families, and as is often the case among the better off, drive very fancy cars, go to expensive restaurants, and so on.

Yes, and this is well recognized.

Unknown said:
His rational for this is that not identifying the existence to be negated as inherent existence entails "over-negating" common objects as non-existent when actually they do exist depending on imputation, i.e. exist dependently but not inherently.

Malcolm wrote:
Inherent existence is also an imputation. Therefore, what is the difference between the two imputations, existence and inherent existence?

It is for this reason that Nāgārjuna notes that there is no existence not included in inherent existence (svabhāva) and dependent existence (parabhāva). He then continues on to say that whoever has a view of inherent existence, dependent existence, existence, or nonexistence has not understood the meaning of the Buddha's teachings.

The reason one negates existence is not to assert nonexistence. One negates existence in order to negate the nonexistence of an existent. This is all carefully argued in chapter 15 of the MMK. In fact, common people do not think cups and persons exist inherently, since they observe them to also cease to exist. This is why Nāgārjuna points out that "nonexistence" is the transformation of something that once was and now is not, according to common parlance.

Relatively speaking, we can contrast the conditioned and the unconditioned, but not ultimately. Why? Because the very definition of the conditioned, born, become, made, etc., defines for us its opposite, unconditioned, unborn, unmade, etc., and renders the latter a mere relative construct that can be found according to an ultimate analysis.

It if for this reason that Nāgārjuna declared, following the Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra, that not the slightest distinction can be made between samsara and nirvana since they are both relative constructs and cannot bear ultimate analysis in anyway.

Analytical cessation is nirvana.

Simple cessation is the absence of a cause of arising.

If the object to be negated actually doesn't exist at all is it something you can find?

Herbie said:
yes because inherent existence is the object projected/superimposed by a mental factor onto the object that then appears as if inherently existent.
Identification of the object of negation which is inherent existence presumes that it can be found as projection. But since it seems to inhere in the object it is projected onto it cannot be found as an isolated stand-alone object but only with the object onto which it is projected. Therefore only this alleged inherently existent object can be sought but of course cannot be found because an inherent existent object does not exist anywhere. However although the object onto which inherent existence is projected cannot be found by a rational consciousness the perception of the mere object still is there. So the difference beween the perceptual appearance of the object before non-findability experientially "happened" and after that event is what corresponds to "inherent existence".

Malcolm wrote:
Yeah, but this notion of "inherent existence" is not a notion that common people have, which is why in general Madhyamakas, including Candrakīrti, are satisfied with negating existence, the coarse object of negation, and only discuss inherent existence, the subtle object of negation, as a fine point.

Unknown said:
Mr. Chairman, this amendment is simple and straightforward. It would
prohibit the Export-Import Bank from providing corporate welfare for
the construction of nuclear power plants in China.
Mr. Chairman, I think the rationale for supporting this amendment is
obvious. At a time when we have a $7.7 trillion national debt and a
record-breaking Federal deficit, it is not only absurd, but it is
dangerous for the taxpayers of this country to be subsidizing the
construction of nuclear power plants in China.

{time}  1915

Mr. Chairman, amazingly enough, the company involved here,
Westinghouse Electric, which builds nuclear technology is owned by
British National Fuels which itself is a company wholly owned by the
British government. So we are dealing with the absurdity of American
taxpayers who are in the midst of a record breaking deficit,
subsidizing the British government, a nation which, to the best of my
knowledge, is not made up of starving, desperate people in the
developing world.
Mr. Chairman, there is no debate, but that when these four nuclear
power plants will be built at a cost which involves an Export-Import
loan of some $5 billion, that when these nuclear power plants will be
built, the Chinese will own the technology. And a question that every
Member of this Congress should be asking is, is it really in the best
interest of the United States of America to provide advanced nuclear
technology to China. Furthermore, the Chinese company which is building
these four nuclear power plants, the Chinese national nuclear company
has been tied to at least three instances of weapons proliferation
involving Iran and Pakistan.
Mr. Chairman, I do not always agree with the National Taxpayers
Union. But let me briefly summarize what they say in a letter that they
sent to me today.
NTU has long advocated total elimination of taxpayer funding of the
Export-Import Bank for the simple fact that American taxpayers should
not be forced to subsidize the overseas operation of U.S. corporation
or foreign governments. Considering the rapid pace of economic growth
in China and its emergence as a strong force in the global business
environment, it is particularly egregious to waste taxpayer dollars on
such a project.

Hello,

There are some problems with the premises of the questions asked. First, the terms "priest" or "monk" are words that are pretty ill fitting translations for the original Japanese/Chinese or Pali/Sanskrit terms imposed when Judeo-Christian vocabulary was used in the 19th century and earlier by Western missionaries to roughly translate concepts that are different in important ways. "Priest" carries the feeling of working some power to intervene with God/the spirits. In Japan, most Zen "monks" only reside in monasteries for periods as part of their training ... so both words are not good fits except when the person is actually residing in a monastery and might be described then as a "monk". Originally in India, the life of a wandering mendicant was anticipated, and this later transitioned into a more settled monastic model in India and the rest of Asia. These days, most Japanese Zen and other Buddhist clergy marry!

Malcolm wrote:
Only in Japan.

jundo cohen said:
The rest depends on whose Ordination Precepts are considered the most complete, encompassing and superior. The answer to that is, for each school looking at its own Precepts, all are complete and encompassing and equally superior. In the Soto School, we undertake 16 Bodhisattva Precepts, and we believe that such encompass the entire Vinaya. We believe that modern marriage is also a form of Celibacy if the heart is cleansed of greed, anger and divisive thoughts in ignorance in which people are seen as two.

Some other folks may show up in this thread and criticize our 16 Precepts and married ways as not legitimate. I say, stick to you own ways, interpretations and Precepts and keep your nose out of ours. As far as we are concerned, all Buddhist Clergy everywehre sit shoulder to should ... no one more authentic or superior to another. Please keep your own views to yourself.

Malcolm wrote:
But in the wider context of the Buddhist world, you are not, and never will be on par with a Bhikṣu/Bhikṣuni or a Bhikku/Bhikkuni, regardless of your standing within your own religious community. In a Tibetan setting, you might be seated among the bhikṣus out of desire to show respect or misunderstanding of your actual ordination, but from their point of view, you will never be part of the monastic Sangha, just like a Ngagpa like me isn't considered part of the monastic Sangha and will always be seated behind the monks. I think you will find the same attitude among Theravadins. Basically, if you have sex, you are not a bhikṣu. You can offer all kinds of fine reasons for why this isn't fair, is not accurate and so on, but in the eyes of the broader Buddhist world, while you may be an "ordinand" in the sense that you underwent a kind of ordination, it will never be regarded as serious as a bhikṣu ordination, or for the matter, even a śramaṇera (novice) ordination. Why? Because you drink wine, have a family, and continue, one supposes, to be sexually active.

This is not pointed out to you out of some wish to slight you or other Zen ordinands (and Tendai, Pure Land, Nicherin, etc. ordinands) or create a category of higher and lower, it is just that outside of the insular and historically unique world of Japanese Buddhism, this is how a majority of Buddhists see it.

Now from my point of view, I don't see much how the monastic Sangha can survive in a serious way in the west without corporate sponsorships (or ethnic community sponsorship), so indeed it is very likely that the lay ministry (to which you actually belong though you dispute the distinction) will come to dominate the way most Buddhist communities in the West are ministered, and this is not a bad thing. It is just not the same thing as having a community lead by celibate (and theoretically, ethically superior) monastic Sangha.

Yes, because a gandharva, a consciousness seeking rebirth, has entered the fertilized ovum.

If the zygote is not viable, it will not survive implantation. But conception cannot occur without three things, as the Medical Tantra states:
First, from a man and women’s non-defective semen and blood, and a consciousness impelled by action and affliction, the five elements assemble, the cause of conception, in the womb. For example, it is equivalent with fire produced from fire sticks.

Sensations, according to Desri Sangye Gyatso's commentary on the Medicine Tanta, occur only in the 24th week:
In the twenty-fourth month the “moving everywhere” wind clear matures the functional and  hollow organs. At that time,  also the thoughts of happiness and suffering, the objects of sensation, become known.

Queen Elizabeth II said:
I sense that the two of you are just using 'viable' in different ways. In one sense it means capable of maintaining a separate existence, and so would only apply to a child after birth or one in the womb that had developed enough that it could survive if born prematurely. But in another and more recent sense it simply means capable of growing and developing and would apply to any fertilized ovum, even one in a petri dish. The former sense is the dominant one in embryology and the latter in botany (esp. with regard to seeds) but sometimes the latter is used even in embryology.

In the Japanese lines, we believe that our Ordinations stand head and shoulders ... not in front nor behind ... with Buddhist Ordinations of any kind any where on the continent.

And as I explained at the time, the issue was how to negotiate this within the wider context of the Buddhist world where the term monk = celibate ordinand.

Hell, Jundo, I also have special vows which are not part and partial of what average Tibetan people who practice Vajrayāna follow, since I am an ordained "Ngagpa," which is something somewhat comparable to a Shugendo priest. So I don't cut my hair (it's a commitment), among other things, as a sign of my ordination. But I am not a monastic, even though I am "ordained."

Monastic ordination was quite changed by Saicho, who dispensed with Hinayāna ordinations, and by the time the nineteenth century rolled around, there really was no such thing as a bhikṣu in Japan anymore.

But within the wider world of Buddhism, there remains a celibate ordination, and this was the original path that Buddha taught. Even Mahākashyapa was a celibate monk. Outside of the little world of Soto and Rinzai Zen, this is what you have to negotiate.

But just as external signs cannot indicate to someone who is a buddha and who is not, likewise, external signs of ordination cannot indicate who is a "beggar" (bhikṣu) and who is not. It is better to give up robes and trappings, since they are really just traps.

Western Medicine advanced beyond the level of Tibetan Medicine and Ayurveda because of the invention of anesthesia and then Xrays, primarily. But circa, 1850, it was actually quite behind Tibetan Medicine in particular, since Tibetan Medicine has a germ theory of disease, understood circulation, the nervous system, and all of this understanding dates back to the 9th century CE at least.

As for the paths, in Zen there are all sorts of ways to categorise teachings, but the ultimate one is always sudden enlightenment. Among other things it means realising that afflictions are bodhi, to quote a general Mahayana concept. It also means the insight into the dharmas being unborn.

On the significance of the Sanders win in the Michigan primary:

http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/wha ... gan-means/
my colleague Nate Silver went back and found that only one primary, the 1984 Democratic primary in New Hampshire, was even on the same scale as this upset. In that contest, the polling average had Walter Mondale beating Gary Hart by 17 percentage points, but it was Hart who won, with slightly more than 9 percentage points over Mondale.

Indeed, my initial thought was to compare the Sanders upset with Clinton’s over Barack Obama in the 2008 New Hampshire Democratic primary, but that undersells what happened Tuesday night. I was in New Hampshire when Clinton won in 2008 and sat in stunned disbelief — Obama lost by about 3 percentage points, when the polling average had him ahead by 8 percentage points. In other words, tonight’s error was more than double what occurred eight years ago.
And to put THAT into context, Sanders still lost on the evening overall in terms of delegates, because Clinton overwhelmingly won Mississippi.  I think it's safe to say that Sanders has momentum and that the really unfavorable states for Sanders have already voted.

When the "superdelegates" already pledged to Clinton begin to peel away and commit to Sanders, then it will be clear to everyone that the machine is starting to view a Sanders victory as somewhere on a spectrum from "likely" to "immanent."

Parenthetically, I find it contemptible that a party that calls itself "Democratic" has such a ridiculously undemocratic system for selecting a nominee.  Superdelegates?  Really?

Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD), the clinical term for seeing weird, trippy things like geometric hallucinations, flashes of color, afterimages and false perceptions of movement after taking psychedelics. To be considered a candidate for HPPD, the type of visual phenomena that occurs during an acid trip has to spontaneously reappear "long after the use of hallucinogens has stopped," cause significant distress, and not be explainable by any other mental disorder or medical condition. For many, it's less of a sudden "flashback" and more of a continuous disturbance of vision.

As near as I can tell and working from limited experience, the Zen teaching situation is in part about creating a kind of context for encountering something.  So all kinds of outrageous and confusing things can happen:  the teacher charges in and kills a cat in front of everyone, for example.  What was THAT about?  I think the attempts to mobilize the literary figures of ancient Ch'an masters in the present are attempts to introduce someone to this kind of learning environment.

But I feel qualified to comment.  Two of my brothers-in-law are monks.  I have spent a good deal of time with Tibetan monks in monasteries, and with ex-monks as well.  Some of my best friends were monks, frankly.

If one understands by "career paths" a lifestyle and culture that allows for basic human necessities to be met (food, shelter, clothing, social interaction), in exchange for living within the rules and structure of monastic life, it should be clear that being a monk is indeed a "career path."  Some monks work for the monastery for their entire lives, in exchange for these necessities.  Some go on to become Lamas, which, frankly, is also a career path.

Here in the West, for the most part, we don't have the monastic infrastructure that will support careers like these.   But for centuries a monastic career has been a viable choice for Tibetans and those in the Himalayan region in general.  (Mostly men, I must say......before anyone rushes to point it out).

There is a high incidence of monasticism in Buddhist countries--not merely in Vajrayana countries.  That's a point worth understanding.

Overuse alters the mind, one lacks shame, and modesty is destroyed.  The first kind of drunk is stays in shameless places, overcome by evil thoughts, he thinks he is happy. The second kind of drunk is like a intoxicated elephant, committing misdeeds and staying places that violate his discipline. The final kind of drunk is mindless and lies like a corpse, not knowing anything at all, like a place of darkness.
Then of course there is Longchenpa's famous praise to booze, where is shows that a) alcohol has many praiseworthy qualities and b) there are a lot of Buddhist hypocrites out there who drink but like to pretend they do not in public.

My goal in drinking wine is conviviality and warmth. Your mileage may vary. I am aware of the the faults of overuse. Wine tasters spit because when you are tasting three hundred wines, well, you get the picture.

Therefore, I see no reason at all why psychedelics cannot play a valid and useful role in many conditions where recent research seems to indicate that there is much benefit from them.

But as we know VERY well that in Buddhism, experiences are no big deal.  Actually they can be real obstacles on the path.  So...

Malcolm wrote:
The idea that LSD and so on can create genetic damage is total nonsense, debunked years ago. Of course, if you bathe cells in pure LSD for weeks, you will see chromosome damage, the same can be said of milk or any ACIDIC substance. But the average does of LSD, 100 micrograms, is far too small to create teratogenic effects, even in pregnant women.

There is also absolutely no evidence whatsoever that LSD can "damage the brain." This is pure propaganda. Total nonsense. When you take LSD, the the plasma half life of the drug is about 5 hours, and generally most measurable traces are gone the body within 24 hours.

LSD is a serotonin agonist, which is why when people are having bad LSD experiences (yes, it does happen), they are generally given serotonin antagonists such a Clozapine, etc. because of their action on 5-HT2A/2b receptors in the brain — LSD, etc., are 5-HT2A agonists.

For whom is LSD risky? People with histories of schizophrenia in the family who take the drug in their late teens and early twenties are at risk of unmasking undiagnosed schizophrenia, when schizophrenia typically expresses itself anyway. Present research on schizophrenia indicates that in patients at risk for schizophrenia, the brain does not sever neural connections used in brain development in people 18-6 because the switch that tells the brain to sever hormonally those connections is not turned on, and so therefore, there are a large number of neuronal connections in the brain which are still active in adult schizophrenics which do not exist for those whose brains developed normally. Therefore, when people express schizophrenia from taking from taking LSD, this should be regarded as a symptom in a differential diagnosis, rather than a cause. In short, there is absolutely no evidence at all that people who are not at risk will develop schizophrenia from taking LSD, let alone any other brain based malady of mental illness, such as bipolar disorder. Thus, the conclusion is that if you have a family history of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and so on, perhaps it is better if you abstain from LSD and other psychedelics. Similarly, if you have a family history of alcoholism, it is probably better that you do not drink.

Astus said:
From Jingde Chuandeng Lu, vol 14 (T51n2076, p311, a4-17):

Zen master Danxia Tianran entered the hall and addressed the monks, saying,
“All of you here must take care of the temple and monastery. Things in this place were not made or named by you, and have they not been given as offerings? Formerly I studied with Shitou, and he taught me that I must personally protect these things. This is not to be discussed further.
Each of you here has a place to put your cushion and sit. Why do you suspect you need something else? Is Zen something you can explain? Is a buddha something you can become? I don’t want to hear a single word about Buddhism.
All of you, look and see! Skillful means and expedience, the unlimited mind of benevolence, compassion, joy, and detachment—these things aren’t received from someplace else. Not an inch of these things is evident. Skillful means is Manjushri Bodhisattva. Expedience is Samantabhadra Bodhisattva. Do you still want to go seeking after something? Don’t go using the Buddhist scriptures to look for emptiness!
These days Zen students are all in a tizzy, practicing Zen and asking about Tao. I don’t have any Dharma for you to practice here! And there isn’t any doctrine to be confirmed. Just eat and drink. Everyone can do that. Don’t harbor doubt. It’s the same everyplace!
Just recognize that Shakyamuni was an ordinary old fellow. You must see for yourself. Don’t spend your life trying to win some competitive trophy, blindly misleading other blind people, all of you marching right into hell, floundering in duality! I’ve nothing more to say. Take care!”
(tr. A. Ferguson: Zen's Chinese Heritage, p 129)

Alternative translation by Beishi Guohan:

Chan Master Danxia Tianran entered the hall and said,
“All of you here have to take good care of your own spiritual treasury, which is not attainable through labeling and describing by the effortful-effort of your deluded mind, and there is even no need to talk about attainment and non-attainment. ... You neither need to rely on the sutras and teachings, nor to fall into nothingness. These days Chan practitioners are all in a tizzy, investigating Chan and inquiring into the Way. Here in my place, there is no Way to be cultivated and no Dharma to be realized. Merely drink when you're thirsty and eat when you're hungry by way of clear awareness without self-referential deluded thinking. Just always act with this Mind in all places in your daily life to realize that Shakyamuni is the ordinary person.”

I used to think that being a monk is something very important and it would be best that vajrayana practitoiners become monks and uphold more than 200 pratimoksha vows instead of being a lay person. I thought that when Buddha said that you can attain buddhaood as a lay person was just a provisional teaching and it was meant to guide those attached to lay life more gradually to the fact that best thing to do is to become a monk.

But today I understood that in Vajrayana and of course in Dzogchen all you need is presence and awareness and maintain your samaya and do daily sadhana practice and that is all you need for buddhahood. There really is no need to take many pratimoksha vows to limit activities of body (like sitting on luxurious chairs, dance and sing etc..).

But now question arises. In Nyingma, Sakya, Kagyu and Gelug schools we have monks. And they all practice HYT / inner tantras.
So if daily sadhana practice, awareness and samaya is all you need in vajrayana and dzogchen, why should you become a monk? What is the advantage here?

Lama Zopa for example seems to praise the merits of becoming a monk. I used to think that way too. But having practiced under Namkhai Norbu and studied precious vase I no longer understand the advantage of being a monk.

You visualize yourself as the yidam just the same way as a monk tantrika as you would as a lay person.
You practice contemplation just the same way as a monk dzogchenpa as you would as a lay dzogchenpa.
The only difference is that the other one has monks vows to hold.

So what is the advantage of being a monk in one of the traditions of tibetan buddhism?

Ideally you want way more than just 1 week of the diet. 2 weeks minimum but more if you can. It's tough and means adopting very bland and boring eating habits for a couple weeks but it's more than worth it. The cleaner your body is going in to it, the less physical discomfort you'll feel. There will still be some physical discomfort either way so you need to mentally prepare for that. Remove as much physical tension in your body before hand too.

Have in mind the specific areas of your life that you're looking to bring some healing and clarity too. Which emotions or afflictions bring the most harm to yourself and others in your life? Which conscious or subconscious thought patterns bring yourself and those you interactive with the most harm? Which ideas and behaviors do you hold on to that act against your highest spiritual-good and the highest spiritual-good of those in your life?

It's not been mentioned much in discussions on Dharma and psychedelics/plant-medicine , but if you sincerely combine the intention and aspiration of Bodhichitta to your journey/ceremony, then whatever happens, you'll know that your intention was at least sound.

In the long run, this is about more than just you as it can potentially change how you view the world and interact with others, but at the same time, it's also a very personal experience and opportunity to access parts of the psyche that are usually double or tipple veiled by symbol and imagery. Speak and ask constructive questions to the medicine and your own awareness to guide the journey forwards beneficial insights.

Integration of the experience afterwards is just as important as the experience it's self. Record the experience in words and potentially pictures while it's still fresh.

[some other links removed]
On these forums you will find all kind of folk, but there are members with 40+ years of experience in shamanism and entheogen use. You will be amazed at the quality of some discussions and the vastness of the information you can find.

[some other links removed]

Do yourself a favor, go there and spare yourself the indoctrination. Do your own research and form your own opinions responsibly. Have common sense and be safe. Finally, my personal advice would be for you to consider Ayahuasca for your first trip and to avoid MDMA for now, as it requires a different kind of knowledge and can cause more problems if improperly used, not to mention that it would be very difficult for you to know exactly what you are taking. If you decide to go on with this, stick to Santo Daime and follow their recommendations to the letter, as they have genuine lineage and knowledge about this, not to mention that you will be getting the real brew. Follow the regimen strictly.

{Moderator note: the Nexus forum is uncritically enthusiastic about Ayahuasca and other drugs to the point of irresponsibility. Its advice is therefore far less balanced than readers will find here on DW and should be approached with caution.]

But they ARE so classed Malcolm. The active agent in Psilocybin for example is an alkaloid shown to directly affect neurotransmission by modifying the structure of serotonin.
You may advocate a reclassification of these substances. But medical science sees them as neurotoxins.

Malcolm wrote:
LSD has no known toxicity level. The toxicity level of Psilocybin is so low, you would have to take the amount of psilocybin found in 45 pounds of mushrooms in order to experience any toxic effect. DMT also has no known toxicity level. And if you ingest it raw, without a catalyst, it just passes through your digestive tract with no effect at all (which is why people smoke it or combine it with an MAO Inhibitor).

I suspect these things are defined as neurotoxins as a result of Gvt. policy rather than scientific definition.  Alcohol is a neurotoxin of much greater strength than Psilocybin, and as I pointed out, LSD and DMT have no known toxicity levels. Even the putative toxicity of THC is a result of bathing neurons in pure THC for days at a time, hardly a real world application.

Anyway, we both agree such substances have virtually no application in Buddhadharma.

I say "may" for two reasons:  First Anapanasati falls under the category of Right concentration in the Noble Eightfold Path, I guess that would make it a source of wisdom accumulation.  So while it is true that Anapanasati and LSD are both samsara, some things in samsara are considered wholesome and others (intoxication, something that goes against the 5th precept) are considered unwholesome.

Malcolm wrote:
Alcohol is permitted as medicine even for monks. Therefore, therapeutic uses of LSD, etc., are permissible, even for Buddhists in general. For example, if I have cancer, and I am experiencing nausea, I will definitely smoke weed without hesitation. Also Marijuana has many uses, especially for chronic pain. Everything is equally medicine and poison, it just depends on how it is used.

I am talking only about 3 substances, out of these hundreds out there, most notably DMT and Psilocybin, the former of which is circulating in our blood right now as we are typing our replies. It is part of human metabolism and there is a lot of scientific evidence to suggest that it is responsible for dreaming, meditation states and even everyday alertness and attention. In effect, you are on a small dose of DMT as you are reading this. The current opinion is that it is produced by several glands, possibly the pineal, among others, and it is found right now in your blood, brain, liver, kidney, lungs. There are excellent research papers on this subject, notably by Dr. Rick Strassman but by other scientists as well, along with research on the somewhat similar compounds of Psilocybin and Psilocin, which, although not endogenous in humans, have similar psychoactive properties. And, which have been used by humans long before the appearance of Buddhism. These substances, including LSD, have well documented clinical uses for treatment of many stress and addiction related disorders, and active research is ongoing and actually gaining momentum.

On Psilocybin, please see the anthropologic research of Dr. Paul Stamets and also the current studies by the: UCLA, New York University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Arizona, University of New Mexico, and, most notably, please see the Johns Hopkins Medical Center study on Psilocybin and Spirituality - PDF here - http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/Press_re ... ocybin.pdf

DMT is even more powerful than Psilocybin, it is endogenous to us and seems to have these same applications.

Please do your own research. I respect your opinion, but it is misinformed in this particular case.

The terminology I've been exposed to is primordial state not primordial knowledge. Knowledge suggests something static, an object to be known. A degree of abstraction is irreducibly implied in 'knowledge.' The state, as ive found it described, suggests a dynamic experience, something that is irreducibly part of the subject.

Malcolm wrote:
The term "primordial state" is gloss for a few different Tibetan terms which all amount to the same concept, "the original basis."

The basis itself is in fact a pristine consciousness (ye shes, jñāna), completely untainted and immaculate. It is called the basis because it has not been realized. When it is realized, the basis is called "the result."

Drugs like DMT do not produce anything on their own. They can remove constraints and depending on the merit, capacity and degree of development of the individual they can make it easier or more difficult to recognize the natural state. They can also make it easier to apply the methods of the path of transformation for someone who has this inclination and capacity. For someone tho is still perceiving phenomena as external in a stable way they can strengthen this division too. In my personal view these substances only remove a certain matrix of pathways which are connected to the physical body and usually channel the mind in a particular way. They do not remove karmic imprints, they just allow the experience of a bardo-like state with more possibilities. Apart from that, very high doses of DMT and LSD certainly lead to total ego dissolution and rikpa glimpses. To what extent things stabilize again is completely individual and there seems to be a lot of degrees. But very few people actually take such high dosages. This is all what I have discovered myself and what I have been able to corroborate with some of my teachers so far.

We can discuss all kinds of things, differences between this path and that path, this method and that method, and so on, but they will never transcend the need to deal with these two factors. All 6.4 million ślokas of the Great Perfection, the inner tantras, outer tantras, the tripitika and so on all bear on these two points.

All experiences of the five physical categories are nonconceptual, as you say, as thoughts are attributed to them subsequently. The difference is that by direct perception you seem to mean an interaction between subject and object, while I say that it is an appearance. However, even in the 18 elements scheme the perception happens only once contact is made and a sensory consciousness occurred, that is, an experience. So in the end there is no difference between the two.

There is no disagreement on the conventional concept of independent external objects.
But the form is not something that only exists when it is seen.
What makes a form form? That it is seen. What is it when not seen?

"What is the characteristic of the form element? The form element is that which becomes visible when it is seen by the eye, and over which is exercised the supremacy of the eye element. The characteristics of the elements of sound, odor, taste, tangibility and the mental object are like that of the form element."
(Abhidharmasamuccaya, p 4)

Let's take an apple as an example. We can agree that conventionally an apple does not come from any of the faculties, but it's grown on a tree whence it reaches our kitchen table in a complicated way, and during that time there is the apple travelling from there to here. Once we have that apple, it can be sensed by all five physical faculties. When we look at it, we see the form of the apple. Is that form what's come from the orchard to the kitchen? Is that form even the apple? The answer to both are now, because even by abhidharma terms the apple is conventional, and dharmas, like form, are momentary. So, it seems to me that form is only what and when it is seen.

Malcolm wrote:
What a strange interpretation you have. All the Samuccaya is saying is that a form becomes visible to oneself when it is seen by the eye. What is a form? Visible matter, i.e., form is color and shape, and also there are 20 secondary forms. Seeing something does not grant it visibility, as you suggest. Things are visible (or not) to our eyes due to the condition of light, dark, obstruction and so on. A thing must be visible, a priori, in order to be seen.

This sounds like naive realism, which has largely been debunked. What is a sound, conventionally? The vibration of particles in a medium, most commonly, air particles. So what is present is the vibration, not the sound. The sound is created once the vibration interacts with a specific organ --- such as the ear drum. The ear drum vibrates, sending electrical signals to the brain, which then creates a sound. If there are no ear drums, the being won't hear a sound. If they have a sensitive body, they may feel the vibration. Not only that, but sound waves are one of a nearly infinite variety of waves and radiation, much of which is not picked up by our five senses.

From a Buddhist POV, Mipham argues that the appearance is a result, in large part, of the karmic traces and obscurations of the being perceiving them. In the Beacon of Certainty, Mipham points out

On the basis of outer and inner conditions,
One does not see the thing itself as it is,
But in the manner of seeing horses and cattle
In the place of wood blessed by illusion mantras.

An experience is already what is later conceptually separated to subject and object, viewer and viewed, but there is actually no need to establish various minds or even one mind. For example, there is a sound, that's an experience, an appearance. The sound is then followed by thoughts identifying the sound. Again, thoughts are experiences, caused by the sound. Then we have an idea of what kind of sound we heard, and further thoughts (feelings, intentions, etc.) come based on that idea. Like when the sound is identified as the doorbell and then we are happy because somebody we were expecting has arrived. That is a chain of conditioned appearances.

You cannot even explain the dependent origination of appearances, much less how it is that dependent origination = dharmakāya.

In a ruling released on Thursday, a Federal judge found that Mr. Trump, a group of his associates and a union official conspired to avoid paying pension and welfare-fund contributions by hiring the immigrants to demolish the old Bonwit Teller building on East 57th Street at Fifth Avenue to make way for Trump Tower.

The ruling, by Judge Charles E. Stewart Jr. of the Southern District, found, in the behavior of the various defendants, "a conspiracy to deprive the funds of their rightful contribution."

There is no space outside the mind, so I do not propose some inanimate thing. Appearances are experiences - i.e. the five aggregates (PP8000 12.2), the six sensory areas (SN 35.23). In other words, the emptiness-awareness of the mind is emptiness-interdependence, where awareness is consciousness of appearances (not an independent awareness without phenomena). Using basic terminology, no-self is that there is no self in the aggregates, it is a description of the aggregates, and not an entity called no-self.

Trump on KKK:

http://mediamatters.org/video/2016/02/2 ... dem/208862

JAKE TAPPER (HOST): I want to ask you about the Anti-Defamation League, which this week called on you to publicly condemn unequivocally the racism of former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke, who recently said that voting against you at this point would be treason to your heritage. Will you unequivocally condemn David Duke and say that you don't want his vote or that of other white supremacists in this election?

DONALD TRUMP: Well just so you understand, I don't know anything about David Duke, OK? I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don't know. I don't know, did he endorse me, or what's going on? Because, you know, I know nothing about David Duke. I know nothing about white supremacists. And so you're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about.

TAPPER: But I guess the question from the Anti-Defamation League is even if you don't know about their endorsement there are these groups and individuals endorsing you, would you just say unequivocally you condemn them and you don't want their support?

TRUMP: Well I have to look at the group. I don't know what group you are talking about, you wouldn't want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about; I'd have to look. If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them and certainly I would disavow if I thought there was something wrong, but --

TAPPER: The Ku Klux Klan?

TRUMP: -- you may have groups in there that are totally fine and it would be very unfair. So give me a list of the groups, and I'll let you know.

TAPPER: OK, I mean I'm just talking about David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan here, but --

TRUMP: I don't know any -- honestly I don't know David Duke. I don't believe I've ever met him. I'm pretty sure I didn't meet him, and I just don't know anything about him.

Yes, this is why they are redefining the term sentience as well. The "definitional heavy lifting" as you call it, is what I would call "equivocation".
Definition of cognition in English:
noun
[mass noun]
1The mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses.
http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/defin ... /cognition
Cognition has always been considered a mental action. And of course, a mental action, by definition, requires a mind. Therefore, cognition requires a mind. Since trees do not have a mind cognition for a tree is impossible. Unless of course you were to redefine what a mind is. But if you do that, that's just more equivocation. If one says cognition does not require a mind, then you are changing it from "a mental action" to something else. AKA a redefining of the terms.
simon's point, above, makes this evident.
The point above only appears to make this evident by leaving out important information. Which is the fact that the sanskrit Saṃjñā has never been traditionally attributed to life forms in Kingdom Plantae.

Dependent origination does not exist apart from things, with things there is no dependent origination.

Dharmakāya is a result of seeing the nature [dharmatā] of those things, it is the subject. As the Buddha said:
The buddhas see dharmatā, 
the guides are dharmakāya;
the latter cannot be known without 
without knowing dharmatā.
Further, the dharmakāya is defined as unconditioned, as the Vimalakīrti Sūtra states:
The kāya of the tathagata is unconditioned.
Now, on the other hand, dependent origination is clearly defined as conditioned, as the Ārya-karuṇāpuṇḍarīka-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra
All phenomena that are called "dependently originated" are understood to be seen as conditioned.
Thus, if you call dependent origination "dharmakāya," you are making a fundamental error in judgement which leads to dharmakāya being impermanent, etc.

Dharmakaya is interdependence itself.

Sherab Dorje said:
In which case it cannot be dependently arising since (according to Nagarjuna) something cannot arise from itself as a cause.

Astus said:
Change does not come from change, it is merely a concept. Dharmakaya is the nature of buddhas, dharmadhatu is the nature of everything, and both are emptiness, and emptiness is dependent origination.

Based on statements made in MN 28 and SN 22.87 we read this in the Shalistamba Sutra (tr N. Ross Reat, p 32):

"How, then, does one see conditioned arising? In this connection, it is said by the Lord: 'Whoever sees-this conditioned arising (which is), always and ever devoid of soul, truly undistorted, without soul, unborn, not become, not made, not compounded, unobstructed, inconceivable, glorious, fearless, ungraspable, inexhaustible and by nature never stilled, (he sees Dharma). And whoever sees Dharma (which is) also always and ever devoid of soul... and by nature never stilled, he sees the unsurpassable Dharma-body, the Buddha, by exertion based on right knowledge in clear understanding of the noble Dharma.''"

Thus we see that it goes back to the earliest texts. May also check "Pratityasamutpada and Dharmadhatu in Early Mahayana Buddhism" in Madhyamaka and Yogacara, p 11-28. And there is also some East Asian teachings, in particular those of the Huayan school, where they discuss the dharmadhatu as total interdependence being the ultimate reality. As Sung-bae Park sums up: "In the final analysis, the patriarchal faith which affirms that "I am Buddha" is the realization of the dharmadhatu of dependent origination." (Buddhist Faith and Sudden Enlightenment, p 26)

daelm said:
Actually, I think you're attributing far to much sophistication to us

Historically, it's been the denial of sentience to categories of being that results in appalling cruelties, not the attribution. The attribution of traits increases respect and reverses cruelties - it's one of the premises of anti-racism work, that a person you know in all their complexity and nuance can no longer be treated with cruelty, and it's the reason that soldiers are still trained to dehumanize the enemy as preparation for battle, why vivisection was normal, and so on. It's possible that in the future, people will draw the conclusion you suggest based on the recognition of sentience in more things, but that has never happened before.

It's also not likely to lead to Jainism. We recognise sentience in animals these days, but we still use them in ways that hurt them, often of necessity. We'll do the same with plants. It's the pragmatism of samsara. What will change, as it has and is busy doing with animals, is that our engagement becomes more nuanced and more complex.

Bernie Sanders 51 delegates

However, if you add in the Super delegates:

Hillary Clinton: 503
Bernie Sanders 70

So far it's looking like Hillary Clinton vs. Donald Trump

Wait a minute now which one is Republican and which one is Democrat?

(Hillary was a Republican in her youth and has ties to Wall Street and Trump espoused liberal ideas not too many years ago and is now a conservative)

thank you for your opinion, as I mentioned - I am already decided

but I have to disagree with this statement of yours: when everyone is still extremely open, vulnerable, impressionable and not yet integrated into regular life (or even regular communication), they press you really hard for contributions. I found this in bad taste.
I base on my and my friens' cases; I didn't feel any pressing, and my friends either, with many Vipassana retreats being done. Moreover - I know people, who really didn't give much, or nothing, and nobody "pressed" them in any way. I am sorry if this happened to you, but still I would avoid generalizing your case to whole community.

Adamantine said:
Let me clarify: I was not personally pressed. However right after we broke silence we were all ushered into a room where we were shown videos about how great Vipassana was and the prison experiments they've done which seemed fantastic but that bordered on propaganda, and then a long talk was given about how important it was to give donations so that other people could do the retreats, basically strongly encouraging reciprocity. They also were expecting to take donations on the spot, and were ready to accept credit cards, etc. When you come out of 10 days of absolutely no communication and then are made to sit through a type of fundraising drive it is more than an assault on the senses and makes one feel uncomfortable especially if one doesn't have much to offer. That's why I would prefer to have it really clear from the beginning that either I am a) offering something up front to cover costs or b) receiving the generosity of a sponsorship / scholarship. Financial issues are really the last thing I want to be confronted with thinking about immediately upon my reentry from retreat. I found it extremely abrasive. Perhaps that was just the case at that time and place in that location (a large center in Massachusetts which they were actively renovating / expanding) and it is different depending on where you are and who is in charge of the retreat. However I got the impression that it was part of the overall formula.

What you explain rings true. I am just sharing the way I was taught. I was explicitly instructed to do it step by step.

Later I read some things by Drakpa Gyaltsen and indeed he sounded like a yogi to me, something I definitely liked. But I didn't have the opportunity to study in depth other presentations of the Lam Dre, nor the slob bshad. I have no doubt that the Three Visions were "Kadampaized", it's quite obvious. Virupa would probably be quite amused by this development. Thanks for the clarification, it makes sense.

This is completely in accord with the oral instructions of the Lam Dre as I have received it from several masters, with the sutra part being gradual and progression to each subsequent stage entirely dependent on obtaining the specific signs of accomplishment of the previous one, according to the texts. This is how I have been led to do it myself, mostly in retreat. And the Hevajra wangs come after the completion of the preliminary contemplations of the pure vision. This intent is also extremely clearly explained by Ngorchen throughout his commentary on the sutra part, where he explicitly states after each stage what one should achieve before progressing. It is throughout the whole text.

Yes, some masters teach it differently, especially when they teach the Lob She in one go, but the above is still a very alive tradition, and I have personally been led through it.

I am with Malcolm on this, with the addition that certain substances, most notably DMT (including Ayahuasca), Psylocibyn, LSD and, with caution, MDMA, can definitely be helpful for serious practitioners in a retreat setting, used extremely sparingly. And they have indeed been proven to be very helpful for PTSD, addictions and other things in a clinical setting. 90% of the people commenting on this thread admit that they have not even tried anything, how can you know if it is useful or not? Even Urgen Rinpoche had said that it can be useful for an advanced practitioner, as quoted by DJKR (who himself is not exactly innocent).

Having said that, all these things are a total distraction for the dualistic mind, and it seems that people with no stability in meditation can not use them much, as it becomes just another movie to watch, at best. So it is not "yes" or "no". It is something very powerful, which can be very dangerous in the wrong hands (most hands) and quite useful in skilled hands.

If one considers himself/herself a good meditator but is afraid to try a safe mind altering substance, as the first three above, it is quite funny. How will you cope when you die and loose all reference points? You can easily check how well you can handle the bardo state with a good dose of DMT.

Simple put, the conventions of the day generally circumscribed what "sentient" could mean.

I don't think we can consider plants "dumb," their intelligence is as inscrutable to us as the intelligence of some alien race. But obviously Buddha placed importance on not harming plants, and we can observed this from Vinaya, among other places.

In the end, the basic failure of these conversations derives from the traditionalist urge to argue from some perceived "authority." It's like arguing that Meru Cosmology should be accepted at face value.

Then there is this — when you cut a planarian flatworm in two, it becomes two separate creatures.  If you cut it into tiny pieces, each piece will regenerate as a separate individual.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planarian

Are planarians sentient beings? I think so. This then raises the question of how such consciousness that they posses individuates when a whole planarian is split into two or more viable segments. It seems that all creatures beyond the range of complexity of planarians lack this ability.

The more we learn about the physical world, the more it causes us to pause, and take stock of many longheld Buddhist assumptions, like the one that plants are nonsentient life.

While he certainly says that by doing short sessions one gradually can remain in śamatha for twenty four hours, he certainly never makes it a precondition for moving along to vipaśyāna, or even Vajrayāna. And certainly, it is the case that that reciting the Hevajra sadhana itself is regarded as the best means of traversing the nine stages of śamatha in Lamdre, as it is described in some detail in Saroruhavajra's creation stage commentary contained within the Eight subsequent path cycles of Lamdre, which is part of the Yellow Volume.

Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen criticizes the view that one must train excessively in sūtra before moving on the Vajrayāna practice, and this is one reason why Sakya masters tend to bestow the Hevajra empowerment right away, because they take a cig car approach based on Jetsun Rinpoche's clarification of disagreement over how best to understand the statement in the Five Stages of Nāgārjuna that, "This [Vajrayāna] is a gradual path." He asserts that sudden entry into Vajrayāna is implied by Aryadeva's amplification on this point.

I don't think you paid careful attention to the article. While the concept of autpoietic machines was indeed brought up in the original Maturana/Varela book the intent of the term is to define living systems. However, in reference to your citation about food:
Now, the next step consists of going from these very general considerations to the practical case of biological and chemical systems. Clearly, all that has just been said about cognition can be abstracted from the notion of metabolism. When an amoeba or any other living cell chooses the metabolites from the environment and rejects catabolites in it, this corresponds to a dynamic interaction that permits the enacting and the coming to being of both the living organism and the environment. Therefore, metabolism is already by itself the biological correlate of the notion of cognition. In this sense, our view is slightly different from the predicament of Bourgine and Stewart (2004), who write ‘autopoiesis focuses naturally on the internal functioning of the organism, notably its metabolism; cognition naturally thematizes the inter- actions between an organism and its environment’. We believe in fact that metabolism is not only a property of the interior of the living organism. Metabolism cannot exist permanently without (mutual) interaction with the environment. In this active interaction, the organism selects its material, and in this sense a full- blown metabolism is tantamount to cognition.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/article ... 849156.pdf

In other words, metabolism implies cognition, but machines do not choose in any sense their metabolites as opposed to their catabolites. Their consumption of "metabolites" would not be an autopoietic choice, but an allopoietic choice, a constraint imposed upon it by external programming; for example, a production line.

Therefore, the mere fact that plants are capable of metabolism implies directly that they are capable of cognition. Hence they are sentient.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, I think it is false assessment.

Why? Because we have evidence from Mañjuśrīkīrti's Ornamenting the Essence of General Rites of All Secrets that there was a movement in India, led by Śṛī Siṅgha (mentioned by name, along with Bhikṣuni Nanda, Padmasambhava's teacher as well, and other masters), who argued that creation stage practices was taught only to reject annihilationism, and for those who believed a dependent originated result was accomplished through dependent origination, and for those worldly people who were terrified of the profound meaning. However they argued that such practice was incapable of producing the result because a result cannot arise from a dissimilar cause.

Indeed, Tsongkhapa cites this argument in his sNgags rim chen mo in an implicit refutation of Dzogchen.

The basic argument is that creation stage practices were unnecessary, and that it was sufficient to rely solely on completion stage practices.

The counter position to the above is that the natural purity of all phenomena was incapable of stopping false conceptuality and that buddhahood was necessarily predicated on the accumulation of merit, that the creation stage was needed to abandon ordinary vision, and that it was necessary for accomplished the rūpakāyas in order to benefit sentient beings.

The passage is interesting because it is just about the only passage in all the gsar ma period translations from Sanskrit which address the Great Perfection movement in India (albeit through the names of its promulgators rather than specific texts) and its positions, and contrasts this with what we now take to be the more conventional Vajrayāna approach.

In other words, I don't see much evidence that Vairocana, for example, was collecting lots of deity practices in Indian and spreading them among Tibetans. While it is certainly true there is a Vimalamitra tradition of Vajrakilaya, and while it is certainly true that Dzogchen can be practiced by people engaged in the creation stage and other kinds of rites, it is also the case that we have examples such as Pang Mipham Gonpo who appear to have practiced only Dzogchen.

In short, despite SVS's lengthy, interesting and erudite articles, I do not think it is accurate to conclude that Dzogchen was necessarily an adjunct to the practice of the two stages, and I think there is ample evidence to the contrary.

I think the more accurate position to take (based for example, on Mañjuśrīmitra's Meditation of Bodhicitta ) is that buddhahood could also be accomplished indirectly as well, through mantra practice, as he says:
Further, because the teacher has declared that awakening can be correctly grasped with a symbol,
in that case, this is the basis of the meditation that generates awakened mind. 
After the three samadhis are stable, and after binding three symbolic mudras, 
generate the mind as the great dharmamudra and meditate the recitation of the essence [mantra].
Mipham, summarizing Mañjuśrīmitra's autocommentary, adds:
If it is asked, “What is the method of realizing the definitive meaning through the indirect method?,” since nonactivity is illustrated with the activity of fabricated efforts, like pointing to the moon with the finger, also awakened mind correctly grasped through a symbol will accomplish awakening, because the Bhagavan Buddha, the teacher of devas and humans, has declared that it is “great awakening.” Any unfortunate one who conceptualizes entities should make efforts in the indirect method of realization.
Thus, I argue that "early" Dzogchen had nothing to do with sadhana practice at all, and this is proven quite handily by looking at the the bodhicitta texts (should one assume they represent "early" Dzogchen). Does this mean that Dzogchen masters ruled out an indirect path for unfortunates? No. But it does mean the premise "early dzogchen...was originally inseparable from sadhana practice" is false.

It is not a question what works or not. I am quite certain that the vow against taking life was primarily against killing humans, while the commitment of nonharming extends to all living things, plants and animals alike. It is for the latter reason that we see so many of the pācittiyas such as not killing animals, not destroying plants, not digging in the ground, not drinking acohol, etc. are involved with avoiding harms of many kinds.

We do not live in that world anymore, where murderers like Angulimala could operate with impunity. We live in a different kind of world now.

I was reacting to the fact that LZR was speaking to FPMT, where, in my short time, I've always heard and read that meditation is an important practice. Usually not group meditations, which tend to be short adjuncts to teachings, but a personal, daily practice. I thought that was in line with a history of long retreats and hermit meditators in Tibet. And I thought he was saying that such a serious meditation tradition needs to be cultivated in the west.

This seems like an uncharacteristically selective reading of the LZR advice. It sounded to me like his main point went more like this: The initial westward spread of Tibetan Buddhism has been based on the monastic tradition which, in Tibet, came to emphasize study over meditation. Westerners have adopted the intellectual track, and that is good. But now, to make the transference deeper, more meaningful, and longer lasting, it is time to revive the well established Tibetan practice of meditation in earnest. To do that would be, "wow, wow, wow!"

Geshe Jampa Gyatso came around to the same view, and the meditation LZR is talking about is not at all the popularized form of western meditation.

Malcolm wrote:
Jeff, the point is that in Tibet in the Gelug tradition, śamatha meditation was not especially emphasized, historically.

The fact is that Sakyas and Gelugpas don't do much sūtrayāna style śamatha because they think sadhana practice (reciting texts, chanting mantras, and so on) is a more effective means to reach the same goal.

However, based on the model of Trungpa's Dharmadhātu, a lot of Western centers adopted courses in śamatha because they noticed that to some extent, people with background in Zen and Vipassana and so on had less difficulties with their practice in general and more stability, especially emotionally.

If you don't draw lines, yea. Which is why drawing no lines is nonsensical. If they are not equal, then you have to be drawing a line somewhere. Drawing lines is quite appropriate. The Buddha himself drew lines between plants and animals. This is the reason why killing a carrot and eating it is not a precepts violation. Meanwhile, killing a sheep and eating it is.

Malcolm wrote:
Buddha also made distinctions between killing humans on the one hand, and killing animals and killing plants on the other.

Killing a human being is parajika.

Killing animals and killing plants break the same level of precepts. In Theravada, they are belong to the 92 pācittiyas. So in Buddha's view, we can see that harming animals and harming plants have the same consequences.

"But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone: which is the second death" (Revelation 21:8, KJV).

"And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire burning with brimstone" (Revelation 19:20, KJV)."

Just to get back to hell: Sheol is not hell. In Christianity hell can never be annihilation of the soul, which is eternal. In Catholicism, drawing from a long tradition from the Church fathers, it is currently defined as alienation or isolation from God (other sects may share this definition or have a different one). The sinner alienates himself/herself from God by unrepentant sin (if you are wondering, sin is that which alienates you from God). So if you are floating alone after the end of time you only have yourself to blame for imposing suffering on yourself!

Annihilationism today
Today many traditionalists claim that the doctrine is most often associated with groups descended from William Miller and the Adventist movement of the mid-1800s, including Seventh-day Adventists, Jehovah's Witnesses, and other Adventist groups. However, a number of evangelical theologians, including Anglican John Stott, Church of Christ elder Edward Fudge, Open Theists Clark Pinnock and John Sanders, as well as Philip Edgecombe Hughes and others have offered support for the doctrine, touching off a heated debate within mainstream evangelical Christianity.

Since the 1960s, Annihilationism seems to be gaining as a legitimate minority opinion within modern, conservative Protestant theology. It has found support and acceptance among some British evangelicals, although viewed with greater suspicion by their American counterparts.

Sheol was thought of as a place situated below the ground (cf. Ezek. 31:15), a place of darkness, silence and forgetfulness (cf. Job 10:21).[4] By the third to second century BC, the idea had grown to encompass separate divisions in sheol for the righteous and wicked (cf. the Book of Enoch),[5] and by the time of Jesus, some Jews had come to believe that those in Sheol awaited the resurrection of the dead either in comfort (in the bosom of Abraham) or in torment.

IN fact, if you have studied the history of agriculture in the US, there was in fact a rather vocal discussion in the agricultural community about such things as the differences between plantation style agriculture with its increasing inefficiencies as opposed to restorative agriculture which was developed on the basis of New England States like Vermont trashing their ecologies. See Larding the Lean Earth: Soil and Society in Nineteenth Century America by  Steven Stoll. In particular it details important conversations farmers were having South Carolina as well as Pennsylvania, and the kinds of choices they made and why, based on rural publications of the day where they discussed these issues.

I think we could just as easily attribute the conflict to more fundamental differences in the cultures of the regions that are deeply rooted in the histories of the people who settled (and were, uh, imported,) there as well as geography and climate. Toynbee identified the North and South as two distinct streams of civilization operating under the same banner, and it's apparent, even today, that the end of the civil war did not perfectly reconcile the North and South. The differences in culture, that is, in ideology, which sprang largely from the differences in respective economies, which arose from the differences in the cold climate of the industrialized North and the warm climate of the agricultural South are a more fundamental cause for the conflict, in my view. There is, after all, no reason for a government to worry about rebellion from people who are loyal to them or for rebellion against a government which one believes is "fulfilling the mandate of heaven," however one chooses to posit such a mandate as existing.

Similarly, if I pledged my loyalty to my country and joined the armed forces I couldn't just go AWOL without assuming consequences.  There are respectful ways to go about removing oneself from a commitment, and there are disrespectful ways. The former will cause less negative repercussions than the latter.

Not to get too tirthika-ish, but here's something from Suri Nagamma's "Letters from Sri Ramanasramam": When Bhagavan was in Virupaksha Cave, Echamma, who installed a picture of Bhagavan and a picture of Seshadri Swami in her house, decided to do puja with a lakh of tender leaves, and began it after informing Bhagavan about it. By the time she had finished the puja with fifty thousand leaves, summer had set in, and she could not gather any more leaves even though she wandered all over the mountain. She got tired, and went to Bhagavan to ventilate her grievances. Bhagavan said, “If you cannot get the leaves, why not pinch yourself and do puja?” She said, “Oh, but that will be painful!” Bhagavan said, “If it pains you to pinch your body, is it not painful to the tree when you cut its leaves?” She turned pale and asked, “Why did you not tell me earlier, Swami?” He replied, “When you know that pinching the body is painful, why did you not know that the tree will be equally pained if you rob it of its leaves? Do I have to tell you that?”

Unless you can provide a quote I'll have to point out that this is an incorrect reading of the Jatakas.  Sentient beings can be reborn as beings (usually spirits or dewas or ghosts of some sort) that use the objects as homes.  Sometimes they are essentially imprisoned in those objects (like the Mahasiddha whose mother was reborn as an insect inside of a rock that was used as a hearthstone).  This, BTW, is a common shamanistic view (although there can be variations from culture to culture).  Many people who grew up in Hawaii, for example, would be comfortable at least with the idea that beings inhabit plants, rocks, mountains, ocean, etc. even if they were uncomfortable articulating that in a wider, esp. Western, cultural context).  However this view is also acknowledged variously among American Indian groups as well.  And this is also the general Tibetan view.

Malcolm wrote:
HI Kirt:

Again, the story you cite is a cultural misunderstanding of fossilization. Tibetans, as well as most other humans, did not understand that creatures they found in rock were born millions of years of ago, died, and settled to floor of an ancient ocean -- nevertheless, rock formations where trilobites are found are used in Tibetan medicine.

I think the dividing line between sentient and nonsentient is a great deal more porous than Buddhists would like to acknowledge.

Then there is the case of earthworm. If you cut an earthworm in half, clearly both sides live on, and indeed will form individuals. Are earthworms sentient or not? If they are, how does their individual sentience arise in absence of conception?

Perhaps it is the case that Buddhadharma does not account for everything in the Universe, as much as we would like.

As far as the broom and bridge stories go, they can be found in the Petavatthu. There are a number of examples where monks and so on are born as inanimate objects, pillars, brooms, etc.

The container/content metaphor (mind/body, spirit/tree, etc.) is a powerful metaphor, but that is all it is.

Hi, everyone. I'm new here and I have a question to pose to you all.

In 2014, I received practices from someone who attended empowerments from a legitimate lama in bad faith. The manner in which they were in bad faith is restricted in the TOS, so it will have to suffice to say that they did not actually receive the empowerments and definitely weren't qualified to give them to me.

I stopped practicing these teachings and cut off contact with the person that gave me them after it became clear they were using the student teacher relationship to abuse and exploit people for an unrelated agenda they were paid for.

Now I want to really receive the tantric teachings and practice them, but I feel spiritually dirty and I know what I was taught was not tantra and was psychologically destructive and encouraged me to be self righteously malicious towards people that got in my way (divine rage) and lie.

After all, how many of us have been faced with the dilemma of which course of action to take? Intention per se doesn't seem to help with resolving the dilemma. Intention seems to happen upon resolving the dilemma.

Do Buddhists recognize a mental factor that generates possibilities and (perhaps another mental factor that) then picks/decides/down-selects one to become intentional?

1. Would it be correct to say cetana is the mental factor that takes the raw material of desires and transforms them into intentions? My desire for pie has been transformed into my intention for pie.
2. Or is it that cetana takes desires and constructs intentions that are tightly correlated with the desires (intentions and desires are completely different, but bound together)? My desire for pie is bound to, but different from, my new intention to get the pie.
3. Some other relationship?

Malcolm wrote:
Desire is a poison. The cetana itself is neither afflicted or nonafflicted by nature, it is neutral. When a cetana is afflicted it is poisoned; therefore, that cetana tends to towards afflicted objects as well. Think of it this way: you are sober, and you see a very unattractive person you would never sleep with. Later, you get drunk (affliction), and in the morning you find yourself in bed with that very same person you never would have slept with in a million years (karma). Only now you have crabs (suffering). This is affliction --> action --> suffering.

So I was reading "Rainbow Body and Resurrection" by Father Tiso and came across a passage in which he says that based on his sources, the rainbow body is simply the dissolving the appearance of the body due to the strength of the realization of the yogi--- it is not actually the dissolving of matter.

Malcolm wrote:
Rainbow body is the actual reversion of the matter of the physical body into pristine consciousness (ye shes). As Shabkar says:
As such, after the material atoms dissolve, one manifests as light [...]
Though in trekchö, the subtle atoms
and mind dissolve into the state of reality,
it is nothing other than mere liberation into the state of original purity.

2) Does the illusory universe disappear for the realized Dzogchenpa? If so, how is that different from cessation? If not, what the teaching?[/quote]

From the same text:

The way that great transference body arises:
when all the visions have gradually been exhausted,
when one focuses one’s awareness on the appearances strewn about
on the luminous maṇḍala of the five fingers of one’s hand,
the environment and inhabitants of the universe
returning from that appearance are perceived as like moon in the water.
One’s body is just a reflection,
self-apparent as the illusory body of pristine consciousness;
externally and internally pellucid; free from being harmed by the four elements;
one obtains a vajra-like body.
One sees one’s body as transparent inside and out. 
The impure eyes of others cannot see one’s body as transparent, 
but only the body as it was before;
for example, when the hand of Mutri Tsanpo touched
the body of Master Padmasambhava,
according to account of their meeting.

For sentient beings, what determines a specific intention arising at a specific time? Karma?

Malcolm wrote:
As for your second question, karma does not create karma. Affliction creates karma. In order for there to be a karma, there has to be an afflicted mind, an object, and either attachment or aversion to that object. When an intention about a given object arises, that intention itself is karma. For example, if you see an enemy, that perception of an enemy itself is afflicted. The intention to harm that enemy is itself karma. Falling that, there is derived karma, i.e. the physical actions of body and voice that ensue in trying to kill that enemy.

anjali said:
Ok. I was able to find this quote from the Nibbedhika Sutta, Anguttara Nikaya 6.63: Intention (cetana) I tell you, is kamma. Intending, one does kamma by way of body, speech, & intellect.

To express all this in a different way, to see if I understand it, the flow would go like this: I want to harm someone (as a result of aversion)--desires per se are not karma
I will harm someone (move from desire to intention)--this is intention (karma)
I am harming someone (move from intention to action)--this is derived karma.
What interests me is the gap between desire and intention. Obviously given the definition of karma, karma can not explain how the gap is bridged between desire and intention. In our day to day lives, we experience desires becoming intentions, but on close inspection, it's not actually clear how a want becomes a will. To what extent, if any, does cause and effect actually come into play in bridging that gap?

Malcolm wrote:
There is no gap between desire and intention, per se. Cetana is a mental factor that all minds possess. Afflicted minds just have afflicted cetanas. Those afflicted cetanas are karma.

So, while it is true a star, the moon and the sun are all the same in that they illuminate the Earth from the sky, there is a difference in their power to illuminate.

Of course, Kyabje Dodrupchen Rinpoche and Kyabje Sangye Tsering Rinpoche are still alive, but my understanding is that they don't openly give teaching anymore. Even meeting them is not easy.

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. Then Subha the student, Todeyya's son, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama, what is the reason, what is the cause, why baseness & excellence are seen among human beings, among the human race? For short-lived & long-lived people are to be seen, sickly & healthy, ugly & beautiful, uninfluential & influential, poor & rich, low-born & high-born, stupid & discerning people are to be seen. So what is the reason, what is the cause, why baseness & excellence are seen among human beings, among the human race?"

"Student, beings are owners of kamma, heir to kamma, born of kamma, related through kamma, and have kamma as their arbitrator. Kamma is what creates distinctions among beings in terms of coarseness & refinement."

"I don't understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama's statement spoken in brief without explaining the detailed meaning. It would be good if Master Gotama taught me the Dhamma so that I might understand the detailed meaning of his brief statement."

"In that case, student, listen & pay close attention. I will speak."

"As you say, Master Gotama," Subha the student responded.

The Blessed One said: "There is the case, student, where a woman or man is a killer of living beings, brutal, bloody-handed, given to killing & slaying, showing no mercy to living beings. Through having adopted & carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, hell. If, on the break-up of the body, after death — instead of reappearing in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, hell — he/she comes to the human state, then he/she is short-lived wherever reborn. This is the way leading to a short life: to be a killer of living beings, brutal, bloody-handed, given to killing & slaying, showing no mercy to living beings.

"But then there is the case where a woman or man, having abandoned the killing of living beings, abstains from killing living beings, and dwells with the rod laid down, the knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, & sympathetic for the welfare of all living beings.

If, on the break-up of the body, after death — instead of reappearing in a good destination, in the heavenly world — he/she comes to the human state, then he/she is long-lived wherever reborn.

"So, student, the way leading to short life makes people short-lived, the way leading to long life makes people long-lived; the way leading to sickliness makes people sickly, the way leading to health makes people healthy; the way leading to ugliness makes people ugly, the way leading to beauty makes people beautiful; the way leading to lack of influence makes people uninfluential, the way leading to influence makes people influential; the way leading to poverty makes people poor, the way leading to wealth makes people wealthy; the way leading to low birth makes people low-born, the way leading to high birth makes people highborn; the way leading to stupidity makes people stupid, the way leading to discernment makes people discerning.

Beings are owners of kamma, heir to kamma, born of kamma, related through kamma, and have kamma as their arbitrator. Kamma is what creates distinctions among beings in terms of coarseness & refinement...

When this was said, Subha the student, Todeyya's son, said to the Blessed One: "Magnificent, Master Gotama! Magnificent! Just as if he were to place upright what was overturned, to reveal what was hidden, to show the way to one who was lost, or to carry a lamp into the dark so that those with eyes could see forms, in the same way has Master Gotama — through many lines of reasoning — made the Dhamma clear. I go to Master Gotama for refuge, to the Dhamma, and to the Community of monks. May Master Gotama remember me as a lay follower who has gone to him for refuge, from this day forward, for life."

The result of looking for matter, is that it is not found ultimately. It is a mere empty appearance.

A question I have about the Sanskrit root 'vid-' - do you think it might be related to the Latin 'videre', meaning 'to see' (which is also the root of 'vision', 'video')?  Because then 'a-vidya' means un-knowledge in the sense of 'not seeing', as in 'not seeing the meaning, purpose or point'.

Malcolm wrote:
It absolutely is related to the root, vid.

So yes, in this case, avidyā means not seeing the principle of causes and results, for example, when we apply the term to the first link of dependent origination.

I've been thinking that a better translation for avidya than 'ignorance' is 'unwisdom'. The word  'ignorance' carries a question: ignorant concerning what? The road rules? Grammar? Etiquette? Whereas, etymologically, 'a-vidya' literally means 'not seeing right'. So, 'unwisdom' is a better word, I think - a condition which is indeed the common lot of humanity unless they take pains to overcome it.

So in this context, avidya is not realising emptiness, or not seeing the inherent insubstantiality of things, therefore clinging, therefore suffering.

Malcolm wrote:
I appreciate your observation, and I have been down that road too. Unfortunately, vidyā means knowledge, for example, like the five sciences (pañcavidyāsthana) and so on, and as a verb, it is used exactly the way we use the verb "to know."

Certain Madhyamaka thinkers, like Candrakirti and Nagarjuna (in Yuktisastika Vritti, Sixty Stanzas on Reasoning Commentary ), refute the independent or substantial existence of consciousness. The proof given is the teaching of Twelve Links of Dependent Arising, where consciousness is preceded by volition (samskara), which is preceded by ignorance (avidya). Hence consciousness is dependent on them and is void of substantial existence.
Nagarjuna attacks the presumed substantial existence of consciousness also in the Mulamadhyamaka Karika, for example in Chapter Nine: Investigation of the Existence of Something Prior.

Here's something I don't quite get:

Form is emptiness. No problem with that. Form is clearly empty of ... (svabhava).

But:

Emptiness is form. Hmm ... that's confusing. I grok "is empty of." But "emptiness" as a subject/noun, not so much, because it seems to want to reify "being empty." Does EiF mean anything nontrivially *different* from FiE? If so, what?

Malcolm wrote:
Just a minor correction to the translation you are using, it should be:
"Matter [the material aggregate] is empty (adjective). Emptiness (noun) is matter [one to one identity]. [Therefore] there is no matter apart from emptiness; there is no emptiness apart from matter."
The same goes for the rest of the five aggregates, as it is said:
Likewise, sensation, perception, formations and consciousness are empty...That being so, all phenomena are emptiness, signlessness, not arising, not ceasing, neither tainted nor free from taints; neither increasing nor decreasing.
So, it is an identity proposition about the nature of reality. But it is not really a proposition, since the sūtra says that this analysis is a training. A training in what? A training in seeing that the five aggregates, all contaminated phenomena are empty of a svabhāva, an inherent nature.

However, not only contaminated phenomena are empty of a svabhāva, an inherent nature, but also so called pure phenomena, nirvana and so on.

The message? There is nothing to cling to.

Malcolm wrote:
Avihimsa is a mental factor associated with all positive minds in the desire realm. It is not, within Buddhadharma, an ideological commitment. It is connected with personal conduct (śīla), specifically, of actively engaging in killing other sentient beings.

You would be very surprised at how few sūtras mention it. It is mentioned in only two Vinaya texts, twenty three sūtras, and eleven tantric texts in the Tibetan Canon. These mentions are very brief. In other words, there is very little sustained discussion of this concept, and certainly no ideological dimension in any of the discussions of nonharming.

While it is true that the benefits of being free from a harmful mind is praiseworthy, what it boils down to is that if your mind is free from harmfulness, himsa, you will not kill things, or ask others to do so for you.

It has nothing to do with whether or not you use honey, milk, eat meat, wear leather shoes, or even furs. It has everything to with how you treat sentient beings you encounter day to day and your freedom from the impulse to harm them.

Using honey is not harmful to bees, no more than milking cows is harmful to cows.

So, as we all know, the Buddha was omniscient. He did not talk nonsense. If he stated that honey was actually acceptable to eat, and, in fact for monks something that could be eaten outside of their limited rations (when considered as medicine), and also something that is considered as good food for meditators, it goes without saying, that in order to eat honey, you necessarily have to collect it before consumption.

Honey has had a central place in Buddhadharma since day one as a very precious substance, and there is nothing wrong with it. Observe the following, from the Lankavatara Sutra:

" Now, Mahamati, the diet I have allowed for my disciples to take is satisfying to all wise people, but is avoided by the unwise. This diet produces many merits, keeps away many harmful effects, and was prescribed by the ancient sages. It comprises rice, barley, wheat, kidney beans, beans, lentils, oil, honey, molasses, treacle, sugar cane, coarse sugar, and similar foods. Food prepared with these ingredients is proper food.

Correct or incorrect?

dzogchungpa said:
I say incorrect. I think the real point is interaction with teachers, not so much the sense modalities involved in interacting with them.

Queequeg said:
Is this interaction limited to an immediate, personal interaction?

How about mail or email correspondence?

Malcolm wrote:
You cannot teach Dharma through the mail or email. This is why there is no teaching of Dharma here.

Traditionally, correct. These days, incorrect, since we have sign language.

One of the eight freedoms which are part of the eighteen freedoms and endowments of a precious human birth is freedom from defective sense organs and limbs.

The West (except, to my knowledge, those f***in' Aussies!1!!) seems to be keen on taking in immigrants left and right. Why? Why take in immigrants rather than simply foster conditions in one's country that will cause people to produce more families and more children?

Malcolm wrote:
What happens, around the world, is that when women are educated they have less children.

This is one of the reasons why Islam will ultimately fail to achieve the goals you imagine. As Muslim women are educated, they will toss of the shackles off their religion, and birth rates in Muslim countries will also fall. This is already happening in the US.

As I have pointed out before, this cultural conflict between Islam and the West is really about Womens' Rights, reproductive and otherwise.

No dude. Muslims who come here will be Americanized. They will, as they are doing, adopt liberal western values, etc.

Taco_Rice said:
Nah (न) brodhisattva. Their more extremist agitators will merely double down when they see they have the advantage, as their religion encourages them to do, and gradually move society in their direction as the West takes in, and begins producing, more Muslims—"modernized" or not. (I imagine they will also change what "modernized" comes to mean, at that.)

Malcolm wrote:
No, the Scottish Enlightenment, which produced modern Capitalism and Socialism, is a much more virulent contagion than Islam. In terms of infectious power, Islam cannot compare. It will sicken and die, just like Christianity before it.

In other words, to change the metaphor slightly, Islam as an invasive species has already been outcompeted.

It will be more belligerent and hostile. Sanders knows this. This is why, should he win, we can expect an activist president who spends a lot of time talking to people and "invigorating their clarity," voting out senators and representatives that do not represent their interests, and voting in one's who do.

smcj said:
As far as it goes that's right (I think). The confusion comes in when, as Malcolm has recently posted, it is then said tha buddhas see phenomena as wisdoms, thus making the Dharmakaya the nature of appearances as well.

true existence is grasped in this rainbow-like body

When the illnesses of clinging are cleansed,

Vegan ideology is not Buddhadharma, however, and people should keep this distinction in mind.

Honey, milk, butter etc. are all acceptable foods, even in most strict interpretations of Mahāyāna,

seeker242 said:
Buddhadharma doesn't say it's ok for people to exploit animals. Causing them to suffer unnecessarily, because it tastes good, even in the most lax interpretations of Mahāyāna. Kindness to, and non-harming of, animals is inherent to all forms of Buddhadharma. Vegan ideology is Buddhadharma because Vegan ideology = kindness, compassion and non-harming of sentient beings.

Malcolm wrote:
Buddhadharma says we must even treat the soil with kindness, the plants that live in it, etc. Avihimsa does not merely apply to animals. It applies to the entire world. And of course, in my opinion, we need to recognize that plants are also sentient communities. Even colonies of bacteria display sentient properties. What happens to your Vegan ideology then?

Hi Wayfarer:

Dhātu is actually defined as a "source" such as a mine. It is never defined as "body." This definition is continuous from Abhidharma to Dzogchen.

from my scanty knowledge, 'dhatu' is terminology from the Sanskrit abhidharma, referring to the 'body' or 'element'...

We in the UK have our first Socialist Labour Party leader for 25 years.. I think he signals a movement  back to Socialism.
He is a forerunner. The next socialist Prime Minister of the UK will be in 12 years at the earliest.

Well, put it this way, Simon. Sanders has fanned the flames of the progressive enthusiasm that withered under Obama.

The difference between Sanders and all the other candidates out there is this: they all say in one voice, "Elect me, and I will take care of you. You can relax once I am elected." This is the standard message of American politicians since Nixon.

Sanders is saying, "Electing me is only the beginning. Without you, without continuous engagement in the democratic process, nothing will change. It is up to you, not me."
