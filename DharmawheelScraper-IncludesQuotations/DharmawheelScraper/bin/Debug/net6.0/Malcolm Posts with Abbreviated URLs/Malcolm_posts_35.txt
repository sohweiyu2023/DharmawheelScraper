According to Lama Tsultrim, Tara Mandala had some issues with some Lamas who were at a drupchen led by Tulku Sangngak in 2009. As a result of their behavior, they were asked to leave, permanently.

Tara Mandala then came up with a form that all teachers, staff, and volunteers must sign, pledging they will not engage in behavior that might be construed as an unwanted advance. This includes Tulku Sangngak.

In Lama Tsultrim's estimation, Tulku Sangngak did not inappropriately touch this women. The incident, when it occurred was not in private, and there was no further contact between he and she.

This was shared with me in a conversation with her, and she expressed her wish that if it came up, that I should feel free to explain she has a different view of what happened.

Anyone who has further concerns about this should contact Tara Mandala's board of director's directly. Tara Mandala is not a place that covers up sexual harassment and they have a zero tolerance policy concerning it. I am personally aware of people who have been expelled from Tara Mandala, both Lamas and westerners for this reason.

Speaking as someone who translates Buddhist texts (from Tibetan) all day long, day and and day out: it doesn't work just fine. For one thing, there is no rhyming in Tibetan, Sanskrit, etc.

Secondly, translating verse as prose makes it harder to located the line in the source text.

Thirdly, it is a well established convention in English that verse should be rendered in a free verse structure, and it is fine to disregard meter, etc.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course there are. There are reams of passages that define the qualities of a kayānamitra. The terms guru and kalayānamitra are intimately connected in Mahāyāna Sūtras.

For example, the Ratnānanta Sūtra says of the virtuous mentor:

One must have strong devotion for the virtuous mentor. They are never satisfied in seeking the Dharma. They have much hearing, and are diligent. They pure investigation into the treatises. They train in discernment. They train in discerning philosophical positions. They are expert in rites. One should be devoted to the guru. One must never deny the guru. One must never violate the word of the guru.

The Akṣayamati-nirdeśa states:

Those virtuous mentors are without pride, and they should be held as dear as gurus, they should be held as dear as the teacher.

The Bodhisattva-piṭaka Sūtra states:
Since I pleased a master,
I have attained freedom and endowments.
Since I relinquished evil companions,
I have found a virtuous mentor.
In order to attain awakening,
I have disregarded my body and my life.
In order to attain the awakening of a buddha,
with thoughts of faith
for the master, the guru, the object of offering,
I always behaved with respect.

And:

One should circumambulate all gurus
thereby, merit is strengthened and one's brilliance increases.

The Buddha-saṅgīti Sūtra states:

Bodhisattvas on the second bodhisattva bhumi think of eight Dharmas in their minds. If it is asked what are the eight, they are as follows: 1) they have pure discipline, 2) they are grateful and thoughtful, 3) they dwell in power of patience, 4) they are joyful and they bow, 5) they never abandon all sentient beings, 6) they are unconfused about great compassion, 7) they are devoted to the guru and consider them the Teacher (i.e. Buddha), and 8) they are diligent in the perfections.

The Suvikrāntacinta-devaputra-paripṛcchā states:

Devaputra, if a bodhisattva is endowed with four Dharmas they will be a master for all. What are these four? Absence of pride, devotion to the guru, conscientiousness, and strong aspiration.

The Śatasāhasrikā-prajñāpāramitā states:

Rely upon, attend, serve, and regard those virtuous mentors as gurus.

Examples of this can found in the PP Sūtras, where Sadaprarudita, despite having visions of Tathāgatas, still endeavors to find a human teacher, the bodhisattva Dharmodgata, who can teach him the perfection of wisdom.

This all is strictly the beliefs of Malcolm's particular tradition and where he comes from. "So we never really ever achieve buddhahood in the sahālokadhātu." is not an acceptable thing to say outside of Tibet necessarily.

Malcolm wrote:
This is straight from Mahāyāna Sūtra, and more than one.

Lankāvatāra Sūtra states:

[Those in] the divine palace of Akaniṣṭha
are free from all misdeeds,
always endowed with nonconceptuality, 
free from the arising of mind and mental factors, 
having obtained the powers and the faculty of clairvoyance,
and having obtained those samadhis, 
the perfect buddhas attain buddhahood there;
the emanations attain buddhahood here.

And:

There is no buddhahood
in the desire realm or the formless realm;
you who are free from desire will attain buddhahood
in Akaniṣṭha of the form realm.

The Ghanavyuha Sūtra states:

The buddhas abiding in that place
praise Ghanavyūha.
Ghanavyūha has existed from beginningless time.
A self-originated emanation is there,
the stainless Buddha. 
Dwelling beyond the three elements,
That place is without grasping to bliss,
it is free from the experience of I and mine,
it is unchanging, ultimately permanent, and stable. 
Ghanavyūha is unconditioned. 
The perfect buddhas awaken [there]
but without buddhahood in the supreme place, Akaniṣṭha,
the deeds of the buddha will not be performed in the desire realm. 
Once they depart Ghanavyūha 
ten million emanations of the Buddha
will always remain in yogic equipoise.

And:

The Ghanavyūha buddhafield exists beyond the subtle particle nature of the other buddhafields. The Ghanavyūha buddhafield is without the sun, planets, and the moon. Because it’s nature is unconditioned, it does not appear as the most subtle of subtle particles.

That this was normative for Indian Mahāyāna is shown by this passage from Abhayākaragupta’s Marmakaumudī commentary on the Aṣṭasāhasrikāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra.

After our teacher attained full buddhahood in Akaniṣṭha, the nirmanakāyas are born gradually and all at once in Tuṣita in one billion four-continent worlds contained within the Sahā universe, and after dying there [in Tuṣita], exhibit birth in the continent of Jambudvipa (India) and so on until he intended nirvana.

Not a controversial statement- but I do recall reading in Essential Mahamudra- Thrangu Rinpoche’s commentary on the long Tashi Namgyal- a statement but Thrangu that the Mahamudra equivalent of Thogal is something called ‘lada’. I don’t speak Tibetan and haven’t come across this term elsewhere. So I wonder what he could have meant. There just wasn’t enough context in the passage to see what he was getting at.


Malcolm wrote:
la bzla ba, it means "to transcend."  This is merely a similarity in name, i.e. thod rgal as skipping stages.  In actuality however, the concept of la bzla ba also exists in Dzogchen, but it has a different usage, while meaning "to transcend".

I had a brief conversation about this issue with Ringu Tulku, based on some speculative statements he made in his book on the RIme Movement. However, in the end he stated to me that the difference between Dzogchen and Mahāmudra was thogal.

There are also the Sigalovada Sutta (DN i.186) and the Meghiya Sutta (AN 9.3 / iv.357) where the two words are exchangeable.

"One should avoid an evil companion,
who shows what is harmful, one settled in

Yes, for people of Hinayāna persuasion. However, the Buddha taught it was necessary to rely on a teacher. In the Samcayagathas is it said:

Just as a group of patients relies on medicine to be cured, 
one should rely unwaveringly upon a virtuous mentor.

In the Ratnamegha Sūtra, it is said:

Now then, since virtuous qualities will increase and nonvirtue will decline if one relies upon the guru, the preceptor [mkhan po, upādhyāyaḥ] will generate the thought of teaching those with greater or lesser hearing, or those with discipline or corrupted discipline.

In the Gandhāvyuha Sūtra it is said:

The virtuous mentor comprehends incorrect actions, correctly turns one away from shameless places, [12/a] extracts one from the city of samsara…Child of a good family, since one always thinks in that way, serve virtuous mentors.

And:


Child of a good family, since one is ill from karma and afflictions, generate the thought that one is a patient. Generate the thought that the virtuous mentor is a physician. Generate the thought that the Dharma instructions are the medicine. Generate the thought that one’s diligent practice of such Dharma will cure the illness […]

As did Maitreyanatha:

Rely on a virtuous mentor  who is disciplined, peaceful, pacified, 
diligent in the highest qualities, very learned,
understands the truth, eloquent, 
has a loving nature, and has abandoned regret.

And:

One should serve the virtuous mentor  
through veneration, wealth, attendance, and practice.

As did Nāgārjuna:

If you rely on those who
are content, compassionate, and disciplined, 
with discerning wisdom that removes afflictions,
through knowing them, give them respect.


And Śantideva:

The virtuous mentor 
skilled in the meaning of Mahāyāna and 
possessing the supreme disciplined conduct of a bodhisattva
should never be abandoned, even at the cost of one’s life.

Even the Three Hundred Verses on Vinaya states

Disciplined, knows the rites of Vinaya, 
loving towards the ill, has a pure retinue, 
diligent in giving assistance with Dharma and materials,
his instruction timely— such a guru is to be praised.

It is inapplicable because while the Buddha demonstrated the play of attaining buddhahood, in fact he did not attain buddhahood in that lifetime.

Why shouldn't Tibetan philosophers be studied?

Malcolm wrote:
It is not that they should not be studied, but if one is mainly interested in practice, becoming familiar with the intricacies of the debates between different Tibetan scholars is rather a large waste of time. They got involved in all kinds of debates which really are not germane to the main issues the Indian masters were explicating.

This is less of a problem when reviewing the works of pre-14th Century Tibetan scholars.

I feel that it might be beneficial to study some non-tantric texts that are relevant to Dzogchen.  My current knowledge is based mainly on tertiary sources and relatively concise explanations by lamas in the context of short retreats.  In figuring out what comes next, I've decided I should probably read some primary texts with their commentaries by Dzogchen masters of the Nyingma or Rimé tradition.  I already have access to some commentaries written by Mipham Rinpoche on texts concerning emptiness and buddha-nature, for example, but I don't know the best order in which to proceed.  I also have the Padma Samye Ling Shedra series books on Madhyamaka and Rangtong/Shentong views.  There's so much out there, though: commentaries on commentaries on commentaries . . .

In your experience as a Dzogchen practitioner, can such study be helpful?  If so, how?  Which texts have been most helpful to you or are recognized as important in this regard?


Malcolm wrote:
Study Indian masters, not Tibetans. Nāgārjuna, Śantideva, Vasubandhu, Asanga, and so. And in particular stay away from the whole rang stong gzhan stong debate. It is completely irrelevant to Dzogchen.

Thus, the scenario which you pain above actually happened. In response, the Buddha began to insist that to become ordained as a member of the Buddhist Sangha, one needed the permission of one's parents, that one be free from debt, etc. Men were deserting their wives and families in droves in order to join the Sangha, especially his fellow tribesman, the Śākyas.

It is all the more odd, because the pinnacle of Vajrayāna, the Great Perfection, has virtually no use for this kind if inflationary thinking. None of the siddhas in the Great Perfection lineage were subjected to the kinds of training we find recounted in the stories of Naropa, Mila, and so on.

The same goes for popular Dharma books. People read them, and feel the author is speaking to them personally. Pema Chodron's mind training books are among the most popular books ever sold. But books are not teachers. Books cannot understand you. Books cannot respond to your questions. It is not that books are a poor substitute for a Dharma teacher, they are no substitute at all.

In fact, people tend to read "Dharma" books which reinforce their predilections and biases, preferring popular "Dharma" titles which appeal to people's vanity, egotism, and insecurity. Meanwhile, venerable classics languish on shelves, never opened. I mean, just look at the whole slew of books out there which paint Vajrayāna as the triple black diamond ski slope of religious paths, obviously marketed for those who are into spiritual extreme sports.

Dharma only lives in the interaction between the teacher and the student, based on what the student actually needs for their practice, not what they imagine they need for their practice. Once the student has reflected on and cultivated the meaning in realization, they too can act as teachers for others, but not before.

This is one reason why you need to hear the Dharma, not just cherry pick. A good Dharma teacher will not let you wiggle out of uncomfortable topics. This is not about "confronting your ego," or other pop psychology memes Asian Buddhist teachers like Dzongsar and Sogyal have picked up from Trungpa as an excuse to mess with people, it is about helping you understand that there is no refuge in samsara at all — none.

Put simply, you do not understand the three kinds of suffering. When you do, Grasshopper, you will understand there is no happiness in samsara at all.

Professors, to put it plainly, are not Dharma teachers. Moreover, most of those attending an undergraduate course in Buddhism are interested in credits, not Dharma.

Professors cannot, apart from in a private Buddhist University, advocate for this religion over that one as it violates constraints about separation of Church and State.

You can't be taught "going for refuge" from a text. "Going for refuge" means that you understand you are unable to extricate yourself from the floodwaters of samsara under your own power. When you understand this, you get off your ass and go for refuge, that means going and hearing the Dharma from a human being.

And yes, even the basics need to be heard. This is why I spent a year hearing Abhidharma, another year hearing Madhyamaka, yet another year hearing Lamrim, a year hearing tenet systems, etc., and 25 years hearing Dzogchen and other Vajrayāna teachings, over and over again, often the same topics.

Sitting respectfully and listening to another human being explain the Dharma simply cannot be matched by reading books alone in one's room, arm akimbo, feet up, snacks in hand, listening to one's favorite music.

In general, I would agree, though I don't follow Zen or Tibetan Buddhism, both of which place a far greater emphasis on it than the Nichiren tradition. There's this tendency to turn Buddhism into a completely solitary practice where one just reads books and visits Internet forums and then people end up more or less making things up as they go along and never really challenging themselves. We don't have anything like gurus in Nichiren Buddhism, and lay people don't enter formal student-disciple relationships, so I don't want to overstate the case. There's no "special transmission outside the scriptures." But without some kind of guidance, there's a tendency to just confirm your own prejudices in a solitary practice and you never really get anywhere.

This is the party line you learn when you have already met a Guru. What about for newcomers who are still exploring dharma 101 in their favoured tradition and have not yet developed certainty that they want to attend teachings in person? What about when a person wants to practice a tradition with no corresponding sangha available to them? Not trying to be difficult here I just think that many 'well-seasoned' practitioners are already so familiar with the dharma that it can be easy for them to forget what it was like when they were first dabbling which can make it harder to then consider what it may be like for different people with different circumstances, be they inner or outer.

I'm not advocating newcomers go it alone but that some ammount of self-led exploration obviously has it's value up to a certain point.

If you read some dharma and really get the message of a particular aspect of the teaching , how is that different from hearing it other than the absence of sound waves?

Granted some things must really be heard in real time since the dharma is dialogic but if all humans had to attend real-time dharma teachings on every topic before seeing any genuine progress in addressing samsara, afflictions and suffering etc, many people wouldn't get past that first hurdle.

Maybe for the purpose of this thread it would be useful to explore which dharma tenets can be approached from books and videos effectively and which topics when approached without a teacher are ineffective.
And then supposing someone establishes a formal or informal student/ teacher relationship, How much exposure to that spiritual freind is considered a minimum requiremen for books and non-living explanations of dharma to then 'become' useful?

It is only after this that he teaches the hidden treasury that is the tathiigatagarbha. expounding the Tathagata' s permanence for his disciples. The Tathagata expounds the Mahayana scripture, the Great Nirvana Sutra in this way for those who have already made their resolution for awakening as well as for those who have not, thereby creating a karmic cause for bodhi in both, with exception of the icchantikas. Thus, good man, this Mahayana scripture, the Great Nirvana Sutra. is immeasurably, innumerably, and inconceivably rare.

"(The concepts) represent a combination of three older mythical components, all of which are active at night: (1) A procession of female spirits, often joined by privileged human beings and often led by a supernatural woman; (2) A lone spectral huntsman, regarded as demonic, accursed, or otherworldly; (3) A procession of the human dead, normally thought to be wandering to expiate their sins, often noisy and tumultuous, and usually consisting of those who had died prematurely and violently. The first of these has pre-Christian origins, and probably contributed directly to the formulation of the concept of the witches’ sabbath. The other two seem to be medieval in their inception, with the third to be directly related to growing speculation about the fate of the dead in the 11th and 12th centuries."

Depends on the therapist. There are some who are either Buddhist or believe in rebirth/reincarnation. I worked with one a while back.

And it depends on the Buddhist. Not all Buddhists believe in literal rebirth. (And no I'm not trying to open the can of worms that is secular Buddhism.)

I would think that Buddhists, on average, take the dangers of anger to heart more than the general population. It's pretty obvious how potent a poison anger can be ... and Buddhists are trained to recognize toxic things that spread suffering. Of course it's not like every Buddhist catches every gush of anger venom as it is gushing. Hence the benefit of a good therapist in some situations.

No, this does not follow since existents are productions, whereas cessations are not.

You are confusing bhava and abhava with asti and nasti. When one says that a cessation does not exist (nasti), one is not making the claim they are nonexistents ( abhava ). Nonexistents are defined from existents. There is no existent by which a nonexistent cessation might be defined since cessations are not produced to begin with, being unconditioned. Cessations have no being at all, of any kind, including nonbeing. Therefore, they do not exist.

There is no absence that exists without dependence.

When you often say things like "cessation is absence of arising" do you mean ALL arising? As in, cessation is the non arising of appearances, what is dependently originated, etc?

Malcolm wrote:
There are two kinds of cessation: analytical and non-analytical. The latter is simply the absence of causes for a series to arise. Example, a burnt seed. The former is the absence of causes due to analysis, for example, the absence of afflictions in an arhat. In absence of afflictions, one ceases taking rebirth. In both of these cases there is no ceased existent through which a nonexistent can be known.

My text, which is in Tibetan, does not include dedication verses either. Perhaps there were not dedication verses specific to this liturgy in the original terma, but I do not know for certain. Maybe a more knowledgeable member here can comment on that.

What I do is chant a generic 4-line dedication prayer at the end. You may know this already because it gets used a lot.
In English transliteration it goes:

GEWA DI YI NYUR DU DAK
(INSERT NAME) DRUP GYUR NE
DROWA KYI KYANG MA LU PA
DE YI SA LA DRUP PAR SHOK

For this practice, I insert ORGYEN PEMA.

The translation of these verses would be something like:
By this merit, may I quickly accomplish [the enlightened state] of Orgyen Pema, and having achieved that may I establish all beings without exception at that level.

Hope this is helpful to your practice.

People who do not care about the questions or who try to dismiss the questions as unnecessary such people do not need to feel obliged to answer in this thread as those are not the type of responses I am looking for. So its just a waste of their time as well as my time.

Malcolm wrote:
It is likely a text composed by Tsultrim Rinchen, an 18th/19th century Sakya master from East Tibet. I have read it, and its presents a very thin argument which is not even slightly convincing.

It is obvious that sang and so on are adapted practices. The very proof of this is that there are no practices in India where juniper, rhododendron, artemsia, etc. are used as fragrant offerings to purify the practitioner in order to placate local spirits, etc. There are many other things one could say. The reasonings given by Chogyal Namkhai Norbu for why sangs and so on are native Tibetan rites are far more convincing.

Saying that Sang does not come from Bon is like claiming that birthday parties for Tibetans isn't a western custom adopted by Tibetans.

My question therefore is:
1. When does one say the 4th vision has been completed or realized? At the culmination point (after stage 1 above), or only once stage 2 is completed as well?
2. Does the second stage have an end, or is going on forever? If so, what is the end?
3. If stage 2 has an end, is there a difference between people who die during this exhaustion process, and those who complete it before death? In other words, are the ones with incomplete exhaustion the ones reaching rainbow body during death, whereas the ones having completed exhaustion reaching it already during life?
4. And most importantly: What is the correct practice when one has reached culmination of stage 1 and is now in the exhaustion process? Does further Tögel practice matter at that stage at all?

Malcolm wrote:
The first part goes up to the third vision.

The second part is the exhaustion of dharmatā.

In part 2, you are still practicing.

You really need to study this with a teacher. It is not beneficial to continue this discussion in a public forum.

When they stopped being able to understand Latin in Europe, people would hear "Hoc est corpus meus" (This is my body). This happens right before communion, so it is a significant set of words.

Some started to believe that "Hoc est corpus meus" was literally a spell that summoned down God as that he could dwell in the bread. They decided to try to use these "magic words" themselves. Hocus Pocus.

That is only one etymology, mind you, but it is a very traditional one. Other people believe there are other origins to the words.

Alternatively some people think that it is a Czech colloquialism. Go figure.

Malcolm wrote:
They have refuge, bodhicitta, mandala offerings, a 100 syllable mantra, guru yoga. They call bhikṣus drang srong; bodhisattvas gyung drung sems dpa', etc.

I have studied a far amount of Bon texts in Tibetan. Generally speaking, apart from using some different terminology, like sras mkhar instead of mandala, there is no difference in meaning. At worst, Bon is true Tibetanization of Indian Buddhism, like Shugendo, etc. At best, it is a complete path of liberation. If you are already practicing Buddhism, you don't need to study and practice Bon. But you have a karmic inclination, you can practice Bon.

The main difference between Bon and Tibetan Buddhism is that Dzogchen view is found sprinkled throughout most levels of Bon teaching, where as in Buddhism, it is only in Anu and Ati yoga.

One thing that will be difficult for most Buddhists to accept is the Bonpo assertion that their tradition is the true source of the Buddhist tradition, claiming various cycles like Vajrakilaya and so on are Bon in origin, and claiming that Buddha Śākyamuni was a disciple of Tonpa Shenrab, etc.

It matters because in Vajrayana we take the 3 refuges. Taking refuge in Sangha means not to take non-Buddhists as spiritual guides. When taking empowerments/initiations in Vajrayana it is given to those who have taken certain vows including the 3 Refuges. So if Bon is not classified as a form of Buddhism then there is violation of samaya vows provided if one takes teachings from a Bon master. As for me I would like to see Bon as a form of Buddhism because I can see that Bon seems consistent with Buddhist teachings. However I prefer to know what the real situation is rather than following my feelings.

Diligence in doing what? I understand that once the 4th vision is completed, there is no more progress or practice required. Thus, there are 2 possible explanations:
1. The level of realization (i.e. which type of rainbow body) is determined entirely BEFORE  the completion of the 4th vision.
2. After completion of the 4th vision, more practice has the potential to lead to a higher type of rainbow body.

Could you explain, please? I’m confused. Maybe I am misunderstanding something, then I would like to know what it is.

Malcolm wrote:
The two kinds of rainbow body are based on whether you completed the fourth vision in this life, or in the bardo of the time of death.

But all this does not matter much. Even if in this life you only got the second vision, you will still wake up, attain buddhahood in the bardo of dharmatā, i.e. you will finish the fourth vision there. It just takes a longer time in the bardo depending on how much you practiced in this life. At worst, you will wake up in the nirmanakāya buddhafields in your next life without ever returning to samsara again, but this assumes you barely practiced at all.

But all of this is dependent on confirming vidyā in a direct perception, and that must be heard from one's guru.

Most Buddhists absolutely doubt the origin story of Bon. Then there is the fact that of all the Bonpo texts we have at present, none can be dated earlier than the early 10th century. Bonpos will and do claim the reason for this is a result of suppression of Bon by the Tibetan court in the early 9th century.

The Bonpos who say Bon is different than Buddhism are making this distinction based on outer form. Those who say it is the same are making this identification based on inner essence.

This is that same old nonsense, the term "existent" is being equivocated. Space and cessations are non-arising, or permanent phenomena, and they are phenomena that can be known by mind, and therefore they exist in the conventional sense.

The word "phenomena" and the term "existent" are deceptive. The term " dharma " ( chos ) means, in this context, that which bears characteristics. Holding that space is an existent ( vastu, dngos po ) is totally wrongheaded.

However, space is a dharma because it has a characteristic, absence of impediment. The characteristic of cessation is absence of arising. Thus, since these three dharmas are unproduced, they cannot be held to be existents.

In other words, all existents are dharmas, but not all dharmas are existents.

After reading through the book, I have one nagging question that so far nobody could really give me a clear answer for. As I understand things, when someone has realized the 4th vision then the person has achieved basis enlightenment. However, the book clearly mentions stages even for buddhas (p 207). So, my question is: What happens after basis enlightenment? A teacher once explained that it's like a pot which held onions for a long time. When you remove the onions, it cannot be more emptied of onions anymore. However, a smell remains for some time until completely dissolved.
Thus, if I interpret things correctly, then after basis enlightenment, a buddha enters a process of, let's call it, path enlightenment. This is - again, according to my understanding - what the whole chapter 11 in the book is really about. The great stage of liberation is really a process of completely exhausting all remainders. Whereas from one perspective nothing can be exhausted (after all, that's the whole point of having completed the 4th vision), from another perspective there usually are remainders like the smell of onions, and not yet all dharmatas are exhausted at the beginning. It seems that only extremely few practitioners are able to complete this process fully before death. Those who don't complete before death, complete at death. Those extremely few who complete before death then, as a consequence, are able to realize the second type of the three rainbow bodies.

Can anyone knowledgeable comment if this understanding is correct?

Malcolm wrote:
Not sure where you are coming up with these terms "basis enlightenment" and "path enlightenment."

The difference between buddhas of the 11th and 12th bhumi and the rest is that the former have not realized all phenomena as a display of pristine consciousness and the latter have. But in general, bhumis measure qualities rather than realizations. In particular, in this book, the 16 stages are analogues of the common paths and stages, but are not actually identical with them.

it will be great to see in other venues online...lol..

Malcom defines Budha Dharma as a bunch of slogans...

the three jewels is just a slogan over used by some...

Mind only school, just a slogan out of tune with Dzogchen ...
Karma , the ultimate slogan to describe everything from illness to lack of finding a parking spot.

Om Mane Padme Hum
Lord Avolikitashvara's slogan of choice...

malcolm do you believe yourself ...is this really just the use of a word...is there no ulterior motive in using it in this section... have you used it in other sections..

Either Ichinen Sanzen reduces all possible phenomena to a single moment of mind, or it does not. A) If it does, then the slogan does not go beyond cittamatra. B) If it is does not, then the slogan needs futher interpretation . You must accept either a or b, since there is no third alternative.

The 3 factor of the 3000 includes; the 5 factors (form,perception,conception,volition,consciousness), the realm of living beings, the environment- so seems to incorporate more than mind only, but also its action and where it operates.

Malcolm wrote:
If all of this is included in a moment of mind, it just does not go beyond cittamatra.

Recall, the basic assertion of cittamatra is "The three realms are only mind." This includes everything, buddhas, sentient beings, grass, trees, hell beings, the lot.

Now, if this mind is itself held to be empty, lacking any nature, then that is a different thing; and this statement cannot be considered complete in and of itself. If this mind is also empty (and given that it is momentary, it must be dependently originated) then Tien tai view would be akin to Yogacāra Madhyamaka, and would not go beyond that.

so if theirs no actual structure then why does such practices like trekcho and togal require certain experience that is not simply just a deep experience in rigpa, they are the two practices of dzogchen, and if dzogchen has no structure surely that means that anyone who has a deep recognition and experience in rigpa can practice.

Malcolm wrote:
Where did you ever get the idea Great Perfection teachings have no structure?

You cannot practice trekchö unless you understand the view, since the view is trekchö. Without understanding the view, you cannot practice the meditation, thögal.

Malcolm wrote:
Time is also a function of our own merit. We have the merit to be born during the dispensation of a supreme nirmanakāya. But that merit does not come from outside. It comes from our own roots of virtue.

In terms of the eighteen qualities of a perfect human birth, there are ten endowments; five are personal, five are external. According to Nāgārjuna, the five personal endowments are:

A human, born in the central country, complete sense organs, 
not engaging in wrong livelihood, faith in the object

The five external endowments are:

The Buddha has arrived, he has taught the Dharma, 
the doctrine exists, there are followers of that, 
and there is kindheartedness towards others.

In order to enjoy these ten endowments, one must have the eight freedoms:

Birth as one holding wrong views, as animals, pretas, and hell beings, 
as one without the teaching of the victor, or in a border country,
birth as a barbarian, as one stupid and dumb,
or birth as any of the long-lived gods
are the eight faults of lacking freedom. 
Having acquired the freedom that is liberated from those states.
one must make effort in order to avoid them.

As such, converting others is impossible.

You can't say that an active and engaging approach to the propagation of dharma is incorrect for the simple fact that people have connected to dharma through such methods.

Malcolm wrote:
They had the merit to meet the Dharma. Plain and simple. If they had not cultivated roots of merit to meet the Dharma they 1) would not be born in a place where the Dharma existed 2) would not be interested in the Dharma even slightly.

This does not mean of course, that one should silently remain in one's house. But it does mean that only those people with the roots of merit to meet the Dharma will meet it and embrace it. In places where it is hard for the Dharma to take root, one can presume that that place is not a place where there are people with merit to take up the Dharma in this life.

And, yes, I think it is practical because nobody is saying that you cannot receive teachings from this person (and others) in the meantime, nor are they saying that you cannot practice.  The 12 years is to see if you wish to devote yourself completely to the teacher.  Once you have taken the time and you have made the decision then when they say jump, you should jump without question, because after 12 years you know they are not fraking you around.

Malcolm wrote:
No, it really means you should not take empowerments from a teacher whom you have not (ideally) known about for a period of 12 years.

Sakya Pandita points however this is not always wise, because sometimes the student dies or the teacher dies before this period of time is up.

However, it is another matter altogether when a teacher is committing serious ethical violations. Leaving a teacher on good terms makes sense when the issue is just a matter of fit between teacher and student. When the issue is people being hurt or laws being broken, the situation is different.

In that case, the violation of ethical norms needs to be addressed. If physical or sexual abuse has occurred, or there is financial impropriety or other breaches of ethics, it is in the best interest of the students, the community, and ultimately the teacher, to address the issues. Above all, if someone is being harmed, the safety of the victim comes first. This is not a Buddhist principle. This is a basic human value and should never be violated.

Physical, sexual, and psychological abuse are not teaching tools.

The appropriate response depends on the situation. In some cases, if a teacher has acted inappropriately or harmfully but acknowledges the wrongdoing and commits to avoiding it in the future, then dealing with the matter internally may be adequate. But if there is a long-standing pattern of ethical violations, or if the abuse is extreme, or if the teacher is unwilling to take responsibility, it is appropriate to bring the behavior out into the open.

In these circumstances, it is not a breach of samaya to bring painful information to light. Naming destructive behaviors is a necessary step to protect those who are being harmed or who are in danger of being harmed in the future, and to safeguard the health of the community.

Such examination must be carried out before any connection is made through empowerment or teaching.

This may certainly be his opinion, but I don't agree with his opinion, and there are other opinions in traditional Vajrayāna sources which contradict this claim, opinions which I have already cited so there is no need to do so again.

Just to bring remind everyone, the four defeats are: killing a human being, sexual misconduct, stealing, and lying about one's realization.

Now, just to make it a bit more complex, in Mahāyāna of course, all four of these defeats are permitted if one is motivated by bodhicitta and possesses clairvoyance.

Study is necessary, but it is not necessary to become a major scholar. One must study enough however that one understands  Buddhadharma in a proper way. Remember, there are three trainings, discipline, samadhi, and wisdom; and in the latter there are three wisdoms; the wisdom of hearing, the wisdom of reflection, and the wisdom of cultivation.

Malcolm wrote:
I am saying if taken literally it does not correspond to dependent origination, i.e., where this exists, that exists, etc.

For example, when Buddha levitated to the height of 14 palm trees, those who understand the principles underlying such yogic feats will not necessarily be impressed (it has to do with controlling the vāyu in the body). One of the side effects of mastering the two stages is the ability to generate illusions at will. Therefore, we really don't need to take these reports literally, especially when such tales also have an esoteric interpretation, many of which are found in the Caryagiti's commentary. For example, Virupa's stopping the sun is actually a reference to placing the winds in the central channel and so on. If Virupa literally stopped the sun for three days, it certainly would have been reported elsewhere in the world.

Or for example, Shabkar reports running into people who claimed repeatedly to have seen him flying in the sky. In his autobiography he denied having this ability, even though he admits to having dreams of flying, you can look into this yourself.

They sell and trade their welfare for drugs and continue to live on the streets with no incentive to change.  You can get welfare in the US your entire life and remain homeless and on drugs.

I work next to the welfare office and you can see every homeless and poor person come there every month to pick up their checks and food stamps, but many drug addicts just use it to support their habits.  They sell and trade their welfare for drugs and continue to live on the streets with no incentive to change.  You can get welfare in the US your entire life and remain homeless and on drugs.  It's enough money to do that, but if you start working they take away your benefits so a lot of people think it's better to not work or improve their lives, as backwards as that sounds.

Malcolm wrote:
What you are seeing is not welfare payments. Most of these people are on disability. Welfare in the US is really only available to mothers with children. Staying on foodstamps is a huge pain in the ass for these folks, because they must prove to the Gvt. they have a stove and an apartment. Disability payments however require no such proof. And yes, if you start working and earn more than a certain amount, your disability is pulled.

"Authentic lama" is not the same thing as "awakened bodhisattva" or a buddha. I am quite sure that one can be an authentic lama and have no realization beyond the path of application. The problem here, as with the problem of monastic vows, is that very few people actually understand the textual traditions to which they supposedly adhere. As a result, they simply believe anything they are told without critically investigating it.

Sonam Wangchug said:
I think it points out a lack of faith on your behalf, which is fine. However don't go parading that around as the Vajrayana. Why listen to anything these lama's teach anyway? since they are clearly confused, and cannot even tell the difference between awakened beings and ignorant ones.

No, it is a pretty small "if." It is recommended in the tantric literature that masters adopt a conduct in conformity with people's conventional moral expectations. For example, the Pradīpoddyotanābhisaṃdhiprakāśikā-nāma-vyākhyāṭīkā states:

As such, the vajra master exhibits the essence of the five tathāgatas, and the sixth, Vajradhara. Such a master as that having the qualities of a vajraguru always upholds the qualities of discipline (śīla) and so on, and avoids upholding any sort of faulty negative behavior.

By the way it's very difficult to establish what is demonstrably awakened and what is not. I think that a fair amount of teachers who are revered these days had probably done a few things in their life someone would consider shocking.

srivijaya said:
True, though I'm not convinced that awareness abiding in non-duality has any reference to being either a single consciousness or one of a multitude. There's an interesting section on Anupaya (No-Means) in Dyczkowski's ' Doctrine of Vibration ', where Abhinava explains:. No-means is the experience of the absolute beyond both transcendence and immanence (Shiva and Sakti). Undefinable and mysterious, it is neither existent nor non-existent, neither is it both or neither.
Not grounded in anything, this (light) is not energy, the Great Goddess; nor is it God, the power-holder, because it is not the foundation of anything. It is not an object of meditation because there is none who meditates, nor is it he who meditates because there is nothing to meditate on.
traditional Kashmir Saiva is dead.
Yes that's a great pity, as it's a tradition which came close to matching Buddhism's sophistication. More the reason to give it advocacy in order to contrast the two, as there are no Kashmiri Shaivites who can now speak for themselves.

That is why I like ChNN"s quote from Dzog Chen and Zen so much: A human being has his limits. And thus in every conceivable way, with every possible means, he tries to make the teaching enter into his own limits. Isn't that exactly what the buddhist secularists are doing, taking only the Dharma that fits into their opinions (unawareness)?

Buddha himself left the palace where he had everything a man could want. And after his enlightenment the first thing he taught was the 1st Noble Truth so that people did not feel complacent about their lives. So happy and healthy are desirable, but that's not what Dharma is about.

Malcolm wrote:
It is as far as lay people are concerned, in general. You apparently never read the Siggolaka sutta, and various Mahāyan̄a texts devoted to wealth accumulation, health, political stability and so on.

A happy, healthy life with money, position, and prestige, with a wife and child, is what he literally left behind to start his quest.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, this was a display he showed those who needed an example of renunciation because of their fear of samsara.

Buddha also demonstrated the mandala of Guhyasamaja to King Indrabhuti who requested a method of liberation where the latter would not need to give up anything.

This is the elementary difference between Hinayāna and Uncommon Mahāyāna Secret Mantra.

I still have doubt in my mind regarding Hsuan Hua’s remarks regarding multiplicity of animal’s rebirth. Though I do not believe such statements, they still linger and bother me. Seems like his impact is strong. I would need some sort of credible source to firm up my belief. Therefore, I am looking for sutra references to disregard such claim. Anyone knows of any sutras or authentic masters’ writings mentioning rebirth accounts specifying that one human is reborn as one animal, or vice versa? Or if there are reliable treatises that explain of such rebirth law/physics, specifically denying such multiplicity claim.

Thanks,

Well, don't you think it brings us back to the point that both the teacher and the student should examine each other before entering into mutual relationship of teacher and student?

What needs to change is the cultural attitude that gurus own their students. But then, hey, I am a Norbuista and my teacher told me that his job, the job of a Dzogchen guru, is to make one free of the guru. My other guru, KDL, told me more than once that empowerments and so on, the main trappings of Vajrayāna, were just play for children.

Are you really that ok with sexism and abuse of women? I guess your anarchist commitment to leveling hierarchy ends with what you perceive to be your samaya vows.

Falling back on the old "it's ego" is just fricking lame. There is such a thing as virtuous conduct and nonvirtuous conduct. We should accept the former and reject the latter.

Well one old post of DJKR's which I happened to appreciate and
which has generally influenced my conduct on FB, contains some advice I believe to be quite valuable.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.lionsr ... oners/amp/


Recently, he appears to be
largely ignoring his own advice in this regard.
Also, the Vajrayana teachings are “hidden” in the sense that their meaning is not apparent to someone who has not received the appropriate teachings. It’s like a foreign language. Because some of the imagery and symbolism can seem strange or even violent to the uninitiated, it’s generally recommended to keep it hidden so that it doesn’t put off newer practitioners, who might develop wrong views about the Buddhist path in general and the Vajrayana path in particular.
Don’t create disharmony: Try to be the one who brings harmony into the sangha community with your online chatter, instead of trouble and disputes.
Always be mindful of your motivation: Please do not attempt to display “crazy wisdom” behaviors online, just inspire others to have a good heart. If you think you are posting something out of compassion, try first to make sure you are doing no harm. Whenever you can’t let go of the itch to post something, make sure that it helps whoever who reads it and the Dharma.
Whether this corresponds to hypocrisy or skillful means will inevitably be debated. It's hard for me at the moment to recognize skill at play. However, some Vajra siblings I respect somehow do. . . This is a challenging mess.

What about the Dharmakaya is worthy of devotion?

I’m assuming the connotation of adoration or love is a correct translation.


Malcolm wrote:
Depend on what Tibetan word. The Tibeten word most commonly translated as devotion is mos gus, or gus pa.

Mos gus is combined term that does not have a real Sanskrit term underneath it. It combined from mos pa and gus pa.

Mos pa only translates adhimokṣa and its various forms. It means confidence or interest. Gus pa translate two terms primarily, ādara and satkṛtya, both of which mean to pay respect.

Thus the terms we usually see translated as "devotion" really mean, "confident interest" and "respect".

Thus, when we see the term "devotion" in a Tibetan Buddhist book, we should understand that it really has nothing to do with the English history of the word, which really means "formal vow." Devotion means "love, loyalty, or enthusiasm for a person, activity, or cause:" Of these three, it is only the third definition, enthusiasm, which is really indicated by the term in its Buddhist sense. This does not bar us from having love for or loyalty to our gurus, teachers, etc. But just to be clear, we should expect love from our gurus, since the texts on the qualities of the guru all describe the guru as loving, and they in return should expect our interest and respect.

Powerful bliss said:
Interesting perspective Malcolm. I had receive this explanation about the tibetan word devotion in tibetan. I am curious to know your take on it:

Devotion in tibetan = MUGU = LONGING = I WANT THIS, HAVING NO ARROGANCE.
You don’t know the next steps so you come with the quality of no arrogance. I so want what I see. I come naked, no pretence. I need what you have. Humble, open-hearted, interested longing. Translated from Tibetan, DEVOTION = LONGING WITH NO ARROGANCE.

The term "devotion" is not a terribly accurate translation of mos gus. But we use it because it has become customary.

Malcolm,
In the "sakya" section you have posted the the upcoming (in April, 2018) HHST empowerment of yamantaka may be taken as a "blessing". What is this?

It means that HHST is allowing people to attend the empowerment without making a practice commitment.

Hey, if the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas find the Mt. Meru symbolism appealing I'm ok with offering it that way.

Anyway that just the crudest cosmology. In Kongtrul's book on cosmology, titled "Myriad Worlds" in English, he goes through various levels of cosmologies until he ends up with a Dzogchen cosmology. You don't like that either. You're kinda hard to please.

Dzogchen cosmology is simply a variant of the cosmology presented in Abhidharma.
