I totally disagree. It is more than regrettable, it is violence, it is wrong, there are karmic consequences. It is hurting lots of people, causing much suffering, it is indeed a big deal!

Great, so they will be able to rebuild, eventually. Even some of them are sympathetic with looting. They live in their own communities, so they know how hard it is for some people.

To accept looting and say it is understandable, and isnt a big deal, imo, is being just as much the problem as any of this.

Malcolm wrote:
It is not a question of accept/reject. It's happening, and it is a result of systematic social and economic repression. When people are kept in a state of poverty through systemic racism, this is the result. You can, from a position of privilege, express your dismay, but we live in a world where the very wealthy, people like Trump, loot the world, everyday. Just take a look around you. How do you think modern capitalism functions? It certainly does not function through honesty and hard work. It functions through deep international power differentials which allow corporations to loot the world with impunity.

krish5 said:
Correct me if i am wrong, but in Buddhist teachings, any violence and stealing and hurting other sentient beings is wrong and hurtful and has negative consequences. Would the Buddha stand by and support looting and say it is no big deal?

Malcolm wrote:
These people are not Buddhists, so for them, the Buddha's point of view is quite irrelevant. Their karma is their karma, not my karma.

Basically, what we see is that police brutality is being brought bear against many thousands of people all across the country who are not involved in looting, using crimes against property as an excuse. So I am not that sympathetic with Gucci, etc., luxury stores that cater to white elites. Looting is a frustrated response to police violence. It may not be pretty, it may not be skillful, but it is entirely understandable, given the circumstances.

(Not sure if this has already been mentioned or not):

What started the whole event and the killing was a store employee calling the police on George Floyd because he tried to pay for items with a counterfeit $20 bill. I would guess about 99.99% of people who have a counterfeit bill don't even know that it is counterfeit and received it in change from some other store or place. I have received numerous counterfeit bills over the course of my life so far. I never for a moment thought about calling the police on them.

And then of course this is not to excuse the actions of the police involved, but the police should never even have been called.

Protesters Dispersed With Tear Gas So Trump Could Pose at Church
https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/us/p ... bible.html
Minobu said:
WASHINGTON — People who gathered outside the White House to protest police brutality spent Monday waving signs and screaming for justice. They watched as police officers and National Guard units flooded Lafayette Square, delivering on a threat made by President Trump. And just before the city’s 7 p.m. curfew went into effect, they were hit with flash-bang explosions and doused with tear gas.

It was because the president, who spent part of the weekend in a secure bunker as protests roiled, wanted to have his picture taken holding a Bible at a battered church just beyond the gates.

That church, St. John’s — the so-called Church of the Presidents because every one since James Madison has attended — had been briefly set ablaze as the protests devolved on Sunday evening. After Mr. Trump’s aides spent much of Monday expressing outrage over the burning of a place of worship, Hope Hicks, a presidential adviser, eventually hatched a plan with others at the White House to have the president walk over to the building, according to an official familiar with the events.

As Mr. Trump delivered a speech in the Rose Garden vowing to send the military to states where governors could not bring rioting under control but calling himself “an ally of all peaceful protesters,” the sound of explosions and the yells of demonstrators could be heard. After receiving repeated warnings to disperse before the city’s curfew, the crowd was tear-gassed.

Mr. Trump began his walk to the church at 7:01 p.m. for a photo session that lasted about 17 minutes. On his way over, after protesters had been driven from the park, he was trailed by a group of aides, including Attorney General William P. Barr. Mr. Barr had strolled to the edge of the police line to observe the crowd in the minutes before the tear-gassing began.

It would be a vastly different matter if all the protests were peaceful, but the vision of stores being ransacked and people running off into the night with stolen goods only plays into the Law & Order storyline.

Thanks for taking the time here Peter C. There is virtually nothing here that I disagree with. I'll take an insider's perspective on the relation between these race riots and the recent polarization of political views over mine ( which is not only very distant, but also very uninformed) - it looks very connected from here, but perhaps that is a false perception.

I suppose I have inferred this because it seems like every particular issue is playing out in exactly the same intractable way. i.e. even 'should we go into lockdown or not?' basically followed this tribal logic.

Be clear though, I am not suggesting that two opposing sides are normatively or morally equal - in this case for example, I think the moral-political balance falls almost entirely on the side of the protesters. It is more a question of: 'how do we stop this slide into complete breakdown, with all of the consequences that will follow?'

Don't Americans need to be really thinking about this question? It seems like everyone has more or less given up; it's a fait accompli. The cookies will fall where they fall, blood will flow where it flows. Am I being too pessimistic here? What's the way out that doesn't involve the complete destruction of the other?

When you hear the minds of the community directly without the bias of mass media it puts them so much closer and the pollution of media agenda further away.

tl:dr of the last broadcast was that over policing of minorities is an centuries old income stream. If we look to the militarization of the police it looks like tax dollars get put into the military for plundering and then decommissioned military equipment is resold to the police at a premium through gains from forfeitures.

It failed because the system collapsed under the weight of its own in efficiencies. The USSR, as with all Communist states, saw growth in the initial years due to extensive growth. Eventually, however, there are only so many new factories you can build. What lead to its eventually demise was its inability to develop intensive growth. That, as well as the stiffing political climate and other inadequacies of the planned economy lead to its downfall. Even if the USSR was not competing with the West it still would have faced these problems, for they are inherent flaws.

Malcolm wrote:
Were it not for the fact that it was competing with the West, it would have lasted considerably longer. For example, the reason why Earl Butz changed our agricultural system in the early 70's was to make our wheat so cheap that formerly competitive Soviet wheat could not find a market. Of course, it also destroyed the small dairy industry in the US at the same time, but who cares right? By these and other means, the US drove the economy of the USSR under. We simple wielded greater economic power than they did. That, combined with a corrupt government, did them in. China, which had largely the same kind of government, saw the writing on the wall, and decided that the best way forward was to have an authoritarian state combined with a limited market economy, which is what they have now. Consumerism to keep the masses distracted and unable to address the corruption which is at all level of Chinese governance, from top to bottom. So it is not as simple as saying Marxist-Leninism failed because of its inherent flaws. China is a Marxist-Leninist state, and it had not failed yet.

Where do you stand when antifa classes conservatives as fascist?

Malcolm wrote:
Well, since you like to cite historical examples, in the 1930's, Conservatives in Britain were largely supportive of fascism in Europe, until they finally understood that Hitler was bent on invading England.

After the war, conservatives founded groups such as Chesterton's League of Empire Loyalists. The remnants of Chesterton's so-called League of Empire Loyalists, a group whose members were predominantly Tories (formed in 1954) eventually merged with British National Party to form the National Front.

Then there is the Monday Club.

So the answer to your question is that with respect to Conservatives, they may not be fascists necessarily, but there sure are a lot of fellow travelers on the right these days ({Putin lovers, etc.), just as there were in Conservative circles in the 1930's. If you have not read it, you need to read "Fellow Travellers of the Right: British Enthusiasts for Naz Germany, 1933-9" where we find out extent to which Conservatives in England were sympathetic to fascism (but only on the Continent, of course): https://www.amazon.com/Fellow-Traveller ... 0192851160.

So, there is a lot of justification for the charge that conservatives often sympathize with fascists.

Malcolm wrote:

Capitalism is not merely an economic system; it is also a system of power relations which depend on owners of capital having more power than those who are forced to sell their labor well below market value. That power is backed up by the State, which according to Conservative ideology, should do nothing more than provide security for markets, property, and national borders (read Nozick's "State, Anarchy, and Utopia" for a detailed intellectual blueprint for how this all works), but little or nothing in terms of environmental, health, and social protection, with the wan hope that the all-knowing market will sort it all out.

Yes, they are. It’s even worse with antifa because it sounds like a positive thing, Anti-Fascism. Of course, it ends in hell just the same when you are of an authoritarian and totalitarian mindset and are judge, jury an executioner all in one at the same time. It then becomes easy to simply label an enemy as “fascist”. Once you have done that, it becomes acceptable to crush them. It’s why a Tory like me has had rape and death threats from antifa in the past. It’s even in the history. Antifa in the Weimar Republic spent a lot of its time fighting the Iron Front who, unsurprisingly, they classed as “fascist”.

Malcolm wrote:
Antifaschistische Aktion came into being in July, 1932. Six months later, during the Machtergreifung when the Nazis took power, the Iron Front, Antifaschistische Aktion, etc. all went underground. Antifaschistische Aktion spent most of its time fighting Nazis.

In any case, the KDP had its shots called by Moscow, and if you accept Dan's thesis that success against the Nazis was a result of the Red Army defeating Hitler on the Eastern front, you still would be speaking German if it was not for Antifa.

The American Antifa is generally anarchist in orientation, not Stalinist, like the KDP prior to WWII. It is not the same organization as Antifaschistische Aktion, even though they may have borrowed the flag. Antifa in the US have also borrowed the three arrows logo of the Iron Front.

I don't know about Antifa in Britain, but in the US, they played a significant role in fighting the Alt-right and protecting people during Charlottesville:

We couldn’t get arrested, because the police had pulled back, and just allowing fellow citizens to go at each other, you see, and with all of the consequences that would follow therefrom.

So, in that sense, you know, I think what we’re really seeing, though, Sister Amy, is the American empire in decay, with the rule of big money, with massive militarism, facilitated by the scapegoating of the most vulnerable, of immigrants, Muslims, Jews, Arabs, gay, lesbians, trans and bisexuals, and black folk. The white supremacy was so intense. I’ve never seen that kind of hatred in my life. We stood there, and nine units went by, and looking right in our eyes. And they’re cussing me out, and so forth and so on. They’re lucky I didn’t lose my holy ghost, to tell you the truth, because I wanted to start swinging myself. I’m a Christian, but not a pacifist, you know. But I held back. But that kind of hatred—but that is just the theater. It’s big money. It’s big military. And it’s the way in which this capitalist civilization is leading us toward unbelievable darkness and bleakness. And the beautiful thing is the fightback. It was a beautiful thing to see all the people coming back. But they had more fascists than anarchists, more fascists than fightback.

Can you imagine going to your boss at Taco Bell or Walmart and saying, "I need tomorrow off to protest another murder of a black person by a member of the police"? Your boss would laugh in your face and tell you that you have a choice, report to work or be fired. This happens with voting too. People are forced to choose between working and voting all the time in the US, not to mention to systematic voter suppression, which even Trump admits is so effective that without it no Republican would ever hold office in the US again:

Malcolm wrote:
Well, that is why we are trying get the GOP out of power, because they have become the party of racial hatred and fear, led by a racist president and a cabinet of racist white men. And in fact, these protests are not all blacks. There are equal numbers of young whites, blacks, and latinos protesting, and bravely suffering violent provocations and attacks by the police. It is not the protestors who started the violence in Minneapolis, it was the police. Here is an eyewitness account by a member of the Minneapolis City Council:

Dan74 said:
In Minneapolis, businesses have been burned and looted and the National Guard has been called in to help restore order. But a member of the City Council, Jeremiah Ellison, summed up the situation this way: The police started it.

“No one was looting anything in the first night of this protest, no one was lighting anything on fire on the first night of this protest, and yet the response from the police was incredibly brutal,” he said. “The original provocation to street violence was from our officers.”

On the day after Mr. Floyd died, Mr. Ellison gathered with others at the site where Mr. Floyd was detained and walked with them to a nearby police precinct, he said. The crowd was relatively peaceful, he said, but the officers sprayed tear gas. Once the marchers reached the precinct, tensions grew, but in Mr. Ellison’s view the police overreacted.

“One of the city’s employees has just murdered someone in the most brutal fashion,” he said, “and for you to then pretend like you’re the victim and you’re under siege, to fire mace and tear gas and rubber bullets in response to water bottles being thrown — you have at that point 100 percent antagonized the situation.”

Malcolm wrote:
And we have seen this in city after city, where the police attack peaceful protestors, and then of course you have seen the aftermath of the violence. Combine this with a inept pandemic response by an incompetent, racist president, throwing millions of out of work, and you have a lot of people who do not know where their next check is going to come from. But all the GOP gives a shit about is making sure that capitalists who exploit people for wages have their property protected.

What you don't understand is that Trump removed dissent decrees imposed by the Holder Justice department all over the country. This is why the police love Trump. He caters to their worst instincts.

In year 11, he uses a choke hold to get an assailant off a fellow cop. And now something like this. A 20 year career, and we have these three incidents. Is that a pattern? No.

Now, say, he has a stack of complaints against him, of all sorts, of excessive force. Now we might be getting somewhere, but that evidence might well be limited. Prosecutor might not be allowed to present more than the vaguest evidence because the defendant should be tried for this alleged crime, not his record. Did the cop in this instance, have the intent to murder Mr. Floyd? Its not clear that past incidents will offer any real insight and instead just raise the prejudice against him for his character.

Malice aforethought is really hard to establish for these and a host of reasons.

Practically speaking, each of those prior incidents would basically have to be tried to establish that they fit a pattern applicable here. Its just too tenuous to present to a jury and presents too much possible prejudice.

If this were a civilian defendant, if things are done by the book, such evidence would not be admissible there either. Consider a defendant who has a rap sheet five pages long for a bunch of petty crimes, and then he's accused of felony murder (homicide while committing a separate felony like armed robbery). The prosecutor is going to want to present that record because they want to paint the guy as a bad guy. Is that fair for the defendant? Maybe there's the argument that he could flip that evidence, saying, "I'm a petty thief. I shop lift, and steal car radios. I have a drug problem. I don't do armed robbery." Too much prejudice, and if the judge is fair, they would agree.

I understand the issue. In most cases the police are granted immunity for what would otherwise be crimes, as long as they are committed in the commission of their duty. Simple example, speeding 100 miles an hour down a highway to respond to a call, accidentally running an old lady off the road. Anyone else would go to jail. Just a day's work for the police.

we got bad cops up here and it's the same deal...

A policeman  shot and killed a kid on an empty street car holding a pocket knife....he got like 6 months or something..

I got strangled at 3 AM  for walking home ...told that i was not wanted on their streets and i was not even known in police anything..

The police officer who cut off the airway to Mr. Floyd is charged with only 3rd degree murder.

I'm not an attorney, but from what I know from studying some law, First Degree is for pre-meditated murder; Second Degree is for voluntary manslaughter; and Third Degree is for involuntary manslaughter like accidents.

It sounds like it should have been Second Degree murder.

Since the mind would have been grasped and the natural state will arise and recognized, without need of a introduction. It didn't mention this was in regards to capacity, superior, inferior etc, but still is a gradual approach, still a subtle unification of the two disciplines of maha and Anuyoga. I don't think is appropriate to discuss the ability to self cut through that subtle condition but.... You know it's there, and would still need the transmission from a guru, so it kind of negates itself. Still interesting commentary. I'm wondering if this a wrong view, a wrong approach, and am a little perplexed as to why this would be considered authentic introduction to Ati yoga. Is not my understanding, but always interesting concepts of "self liberation" or "self deception". Is a fine line I guess.

These riots, i fear, could have a "backfire" effect. In my city, there are fires everywhere, hotels full of bullet holes, trashed and destroyed restaurants. On the news here, people just came on and said this isnt progressing the cause, and could be having the opposite effect. A lot of business owners around here are very liberal, and they are getting upset all of their stuff is detroyed. Many are black business owners telling people to stop. They just had the chance to re-open their doors, only for destruction.

So, i have the ask, genuinely, how is this progressing the cause? How will destroying businessess, restaurants (many of which are owned by blacks who worked hard to be successful), causing fires in streets, people are injured here, etc. How does this get the police off of anyones back, or keep them from wrongfully killing minorities? Do you think this will backfire and people will say "forget the cause, its not about that now, its just pure destruction"?

Also, does no one care about covid now? These large groups wont help the situation. So, what about that? Do we just ignore the pandemic we are in the middle of? Many people, including the governor of NY, said that going out could equal the death of someone else, so is that irrelevant now?

The black community is already more heavily affected by the virus too, so this cant help that situation.

The question at hand is about "Zen’s stand regarding ‘The Absolute’", and as the term itself was taken from Blofeld's translation, it turned out that Huangbo's records did not actually name anything "The Absolute", but it's rather the translator's choice to render various common Buddhist terms as such. So it's not just that there is no absolute, nobody has even mentioned it before Blofeld.

My track record on Covid predictions is pretty good. Better than any official source. Here is what I think happened.

In 2011 F16, a universal antibody(temporary cure) for all 16 influenza A strains, was discovered. The parent of all influenza A strains was the Spanish Flu. Zoonotic diseases are rare and incredibly dangerous. American interests hired a hot shot virologist in Wuhan to do research much too dangerous to be allowed within the United States. She was to secure multiple SARS type coronaviruses, perform gain of function testing in the lab and then develop a universal antibody for SARS, MERS, etc just like F16. This could theoretically be worth billions dollars. GoF testing began in the Wuhan Institute of virology in 2019. A postdoc got infected because discipline was getting lax at the lab. Because it was kept secret it escaped early containment and the Chinese military took over the institute. The military tried to cover up the cover up leading to the entire world getting infected.

It changed the world for white Americans. It hasn't done much for the rest of the world, quite frankly or minorities in our country.

American freedom for white people has come because America has been kneeling on the neck of the world since WWII. Just look at the long string of fascist dictators we have supported since WWII. Look at the number of struggles for freedom American foreign policy has thrown under the bus since then.

When considering our history in the 19th century, look at the illegal territory grab we made in the aftermath of the Mexican-American war. First, we illegally annexed Texas in 1845, a total Putin move. Then we illegally occupied Santa Fe de Nuevo México after provoking a war with Mexican Troops and forcing them to attack us. We also invaded Alta California and Baja. We even invaded Central Mexico and for a time, captured Mexico City. We basically bought off the Mexican government in the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo for $15 million, and assumed control of the Mexican Cession, supplemented in 1852 by the Gadsden Purchase of S. Arizona, etc. Speaking of James Gadsden, he was also instrumental in the expulsion of the Seminole Tribe in 1823. His grandfather, Christopher Gadsden, was the designer of the Gadsden Flag.

Then came the Spanish-American War, where we took over Puerto Rico, Guam and the Philippines. This lead to the Phillipine-American war. You might recall Trump retelling, with relish, about how Pershing engaged in mass murder of Muslims in the Philippines, having them shot with bullets soaked in pig's blood. It is a false story of course, but it just shows how much of a bigot and a racist that Trump is.

And of course, we do not even need to mention the incredible cruelty with which we have and still do treat native people. America's history is woven in the blood and tears of slavery, genocide, and oppression in the name of White Supremacy. To not understand this is to not understand America.

So, while I applaud you for your enthusiasm, the story of American Democracy is much darker than it appears on the surface, sorry to say.

Pehar Gyalpo's origins are far from certain. However, in general, based on traditional accounts, we can understand he first resided in Bengal, later moved to Bhata Hor (the Central Asian Uighur Turks of the Orkhon Uighur Empire (745 – 840)), and thence to Samye. It is important to keep in mind that the Uighur Turks were a) enemies of the Tibetans in the 7-9th centuries, and b) followed Tengrism, Buddhism and Manichaeism, with the last being the official religion of the Bhata Hor from 762 onwards.

A popular tale, which my own teacher told me, was that when Guru Rinpoche was involved in taming the spirits of Tibet, there was a young monk in the audience at Samye who asked Guru Rinpoche what frightened him most. Guru Rinpoche replied "sdig pa." (misdeeds). The next day, Guru Rinpoche encountered a massive scorpion (sdig pa, same spelling, different meaning), at which Guru Rinpoche manifested as the wrathful guru, Guru Drakpo, seized the scorpion by its tail, and threatened to smash its head with his vajra. Given that the Tibetans were at war with the Uighur Turks at this time, this could also be interpreted as symbol of Tibetan martial prowess in Central Asia.

While certainly one can find pre-Buddhist Tibetan myths woven into various Buddhist mahayoga,  anuyoga, and atiyoga tantras of the ancient tradition, the influence of Iranian religion on the actual doctrinal content of Dzogchen teachings is minimal at best. The reverse cannot be said of the Bon tradition, where the influence of Indian religion on Bon is overwhelming.

I personally do not believe there is any evidence at all which indicates the ZZNG is pre-Buddhist. This does not mean I discount the teachings of the ZZNG, since they are very interesting and more or less the same in meaning as the Buddhist Dzogchen teachings, using similar language, concepts, anatomy and so on. But the borrowings from the Buddhist tradition are very obvious and cannot be ignored.

And so in a real sense our nation’s summers of riots are caused by our nation’s winters of delay.

One’s merit will be small, one’s life short, one’s enjoyments of living will be few, one will be powerless, and many obstacles will occur. Nothing will be accomplished. Those are the faults of not obtaining the empowerment for the conduct of secret mantra. A yogin of secret mantra conduct must first obtain empowerment. If empowerment is not obtained, not even the Buddha will be able to turn the wheel on the stage of a tathāgata. If the wheel cannot be turned, then the nirmāṇakāya will not be able to benefit migrating beings with compassion. Therefore, the empowerment of the conduct of secret mantra must be obtained.”
Therefore, we can understand that the meaning of direct introductions, etc., are the same in meaning as the fourth empowerment, etc.

How do we understand what you posted and what's in the semde kunbyed rgyalpo tantra (although some argue that it is not a tantra because it lacks the 10 subjects or qualities) but......
The non view, meditation, conduct, samaya, initiation, mandala etc of semde?

I'm not following the assertion that empowerments are essential.
Also fault of not obtaining seems out of context, does the quote refer to doubts of having received "something", again this seems like taking the mind as the path.

Kun byed rgyal po in its entirety is a sustained argument about the nature of the basis, bodhicitta; not the path, rig pa. This why it negates the ten qualifications of the path, since they don’t apply to the basis. Further, the kun byed rgyal po is not the root tantra of the Great Perfection. That distinction belongs to the Sound Tantra, which makes observations similar to the Rangshar, which is the fundamental explanatory tantra of the Great Perfection.

OK, so I did a little more reading on this. I'm not an expert by any means, but I understand it a little better.

Qualified Immunity is a defense against a so-called Section 1983 claim. After the reconstruction amendments were passed, Congress realized they needed a mechanism for their enforcement because it was unlikely that local or state governments would do so. So they created a private, civil claim by which a person could bring a lawsuit, essentially in tort, against officials who violate a person's federal civil rights.

A tort is a private claim, meaning it is a claim that belongs to an injured individual against another party who caused that injury. In the case of 1983 claims, the injury is a violation of civil rights caused by a government official.

1983 claims are civil claims. Civil claims are different than criminal charges. The most obvious difference is that in a civil case a person can seek monetary (money) or equitable (compulsion of certain acts or refraining from acts by a defendant) awards. Criminal charges are brought by the state and most often involve questions of someone's liberty ie. whether they go to prison or not.

There are certain kinds of immunity that apply to officials in criminal cases, but this travesty of qualified immunity is not a defense to a criminal murder charge. It could be a defense to a civil claim for damages under 1983 where the claim concerns the violation of the right not to be killed by the police, for instance.

When I learned about civil forfeiture it blew my mind - IIRC a person can have their property taken by the government just for being charged with a crime - they don't even have to be convicted. Its insane.

Prophetic words from Dr. King: “Certain conditions continue to exist in our society, which must be condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots. But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality and humanity. And so in a real sense our nation’s summers of riots are caused by our nation’s winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again. Social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention”

Two observations.

1. One of the reasons police in the US act so irresponsibly is that the qualified immunity jurisprudence has got completely out of control.  The conditions necessary to secure a conviction are increasingly challenging - essentially you need a precedent where a policeman has been convicted for doing exactly the same thing. Reuter’s is running a campaign against this, has done some very good reporting on it, and there are several members of SCOTUS who are keen to tear the whole system up, including Thomas who has written several times that it has absolutely no legal basis at all.

PeterC said:
It is absolutely a defence against a murder charge. It is the legal bedrock of police misconduct.  The worst part is the ‘established precedent’ part of the two-pronged test.  Courts have previously found that a policeman is not liable for murdering someone in their home because there is not an on-point precedent where a court has previously found it impermissible for police to murder someone in their home (as opposed to, say, in their car on on the street).

This sounds crazy, but it’s a fair statement of how the jurisprudence works.

This, followed closely by so-called “civil forfeiture” (where the police steal your assets and you have to prove their innocence to get them back) is probably the most evil legal doctrine currently in force in the US.

Police need to be trained better at restraining people. There was no need for Mr. Chauvin to keep his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck once he was subdued. He was cuffed, face down, unarmed and there were at least four officers there who could have held him down without choking him to death until more backup arrived.

While in my previous post I still had taken the view of a gradual path for the sake of speaking in the same context as your argument, if you are serious about dzogchen then you should be trying to take a view of taking the result as the path.

Nah, that would be against forum rules. But I'm sure you can find something using duckduckgo.com. As for your "No True Scotsman" informal logic fallacy, ràsanach, to say the least.
So, you don't take Vimalamitra seriously. That's your own choice again. I did not write that book, Vima did. You can ask Malcolm to get an interpretation of the title, I did not invent it neither.

But to point out the confusion here. There exist 2 common and subsequent pitfalls that you can spot nearly all practitioner fall into. The first one happens relatively early along the path. The second one happens much later on along the path.

The first mistake happens, when a practitioner for the first time gains deeper insights through practice. Typically, this is the moment when unresolved narcissistic tendencies surface. The practitioner walks around with pride and thinks to him- or herself that enlightenment has now be reached. After all, how could the (non-) "experience" be deceiving? This mistake is so gross, it's relatively easy to spot. Some practitioners stop there and it takes years to get rid of it. They walk around and claim that "no practice is necessary". It's typically the moment when your Zen-masters would send you to do a lot of physical work in order to rid yourself of your pride or simply hit you with a stick. The resulting experience that even basic suffering in front of the hard work or shame of having been beaten with a stick has not been eradicated serves often as a kind reminder that enlightenment might not be so easy to gain, after all, despite some initial success along the path. In the best case, this results in a more humble attitude and helps the person to get out of the pitfall of grandiosity.

The second mistake happens much later along the path. It consists of a very subtle clinging to the idea that "it just cannot be so simple". Buddhanature must be somehow "hard to get". After all, years of practice and a lot of work were necessary to get to the stage where one is. It turns out, behind this wrong view is still some narcissistic tendency, although it's much more subtle than the one in the first stage. This is the place where people typically get stuck with the idea that practice must be kept up forever and ever, because there is really a huge amount of karma to get rid of, and after all, all the great masters were going through a lot of work. (At least, according to the stories.) The narcissistic tendency here is, after all, the pride in one's own unworthiness of really and fully having buddhahood at one's own core (figuratively speaking, because in fact, it's the other way round: the all-ground comes first, then the rest follows). So, it implies that the person keeps clinging to his/her own identification 1) with a self as a practitioner and 2) attributed ideas of "not enlightened", "Buddhist practitioner", "must study hard" to this self. These are thus 2 identifications at the same time, the self and its attributions. This is the pride people take in not being a buddha. In other words, the pride they take in claiming to be an "ordinary buddhist practitioner" instead, which equates to: "someone who is more special than everyone else who is not even a practitioner of such an important endeavor as buddhist practice and therefore even more lost than myself". It implies the person is fixated upon a persona ("buddhist practitioner") rather than letting go of this self-definition.
The biggest irony though lies in the fact that such practitioners, when confronted with their refusal to change their view and get out of this much more subtle pitfall, will point one to the mistake #1 as described above. In their confusion they are unable to distinguish between the two types of mistakes or two types of narcissism which are however of an entirely different nature. As they cannot perceive their own mistake of type #2 they mistakenly belief that other practitioners automatically must speak from POV of mistake #1. They interpret the words of people who already got out of pitfall #2 always from the POV of pitfall #1, which is a confusion or a misinterpretation.

Ken Wilber (yuck...) probably would call this a "pre-/trans-fallacy" of some sort. To provide an example from a different tradition: When e.g. Jesus Christ says "I and the Father are one" (short for: "I am God, and God is me") then this obviously does not mean the same as when John Doe says "I am God". Criticizing JC for taking the view of your average John Doe is however missing the point. So, if Vimalamitra says: Buddhahood in this life is possible then criticizing me for simply repeating his words is missing the point in the same way.

To complicate matters even more: although dzogchen takes the view of taking the result onto the path, nowhere does dzogchen state that no practice is required. This is again the same pre-/trans-fallacy at work. Just because someone has taken the dzogchen view of taking the result onto the path does not mean the person has realized everything there is to realize. Taking the dzogchen view is a means of practicing, not a statement of realization. Misunderstanding this point leads to all sorts of confusion, as we can see here in this thread. A practitioner on the level of Vimalamitra who does not commit to mistake #1 nor #2 will hardly talk of the need for formal practice anymore. After all, the identification with mistake #2 has dropped away also. That's why dzogchen is sometimes said to be "effortless".

Yet, as a response to such a statement, typically a person who still is subject to mistake #2 will reject the position that dzogchen is "effortless"! How could anyone claim that practice is "effortless"? Surely the person must be either lazy or deluded, how else could it be? But such a person's position, as I've shown above, is still subject to mistake #2. The person clings to a subtle belief of "unworthiness of actually being a buddha". Once the mistake has been put aside, a person freed of both mistake #1 and #2 will actually neither insist that the practice is hard nor that it is effortless. Instead, the person will simply continue practicing and stating either this or that depending on whichever context is current and whichever audience is present. For both "hard" and "effortless" are just ideas, fixations (negatively spoken), or, to take a more enlightened perspective, such words are just "skillfull means" applied as deemed appropriate. They are not ultimate realities. In the same way the whole idea of a gradual path of practice is not an ultimate reality. How could buddhahood be either gradual or sudden or always-already-the-case or any other concept that our minds may produce? Again, these are just ideas, and it's necessary to drop them. Vimalamitra does address practitioners who are trapped in pitfall #2 - not pitfall #1! - in order to help them out of their trap, stating that "buddhahood in this life is possible" and hence implying that the person should finally accept the dzogchen view of practicing if s/he has not done so yet and drop the narcissism of clinging to the idea of not being worthy of already being a buddha. It's a teaching device to help people along the path, not a statement of ultimate reality.

So: I could equally say that dzogchen is a hard practice that takes a lot of time, i.e. many lifetimes. Or I could say that it's effortless. Or I could even say it's your present state, so don't look further. Honestly, I don't care personally. (Except that I care so much that I just spent like 45 minutes or so on keeping correcting this post to make sure it's not misunderstood in any possible way.) But insisting that it's ONLY one and NOT equally the other (or neither, for that matter), that's clearly a mistake.

Your late teacher says the following:
“In substance, these three phases(The three series) correspond to three aspects of the Dzogchen teaching: "understanding" (rtogs pa), "stabilizing" (brtan pa), and "integrating" (bsre ba). One should not think, however, that the practice of Dzogchen must necessarily start with Semde and end with Mennagde; total realization can also be achieved by practicing only one of the three series, inasmuch as each of them is a path complete in itself. It is simply a matter of understanding which aspect receives greater emphasis in one series rather than another and knowing how to embark on the path that will be most beneficial in terms of one's capacity.”

But the man ngag sde tantras and commentaries are very clear that there are many adherents of sems sde are following a path of mind rather than ye shes. ChNN has also pointed out that no one obtains rainbow body through sems sde alone. So, I stand by my statements.

It refers to the colored powdered mandalas of elaborate and unelaborate empowerments of Dzogchen Nyinthig; the unelaborate and very unelaborate empowerments do not have such mandalas.

Maybe Anuyoga as a non gradual extension of mahayoga, that's not clear.

Malcolm wrote:
The empowerments referred to here are Dzogchen empowerments, not the empowerments of the eight lower yanas, however, the empowerments from mahāyoga or anuyoga can stand in for the elaborate empowerment, but not the unelaborate empowerment.

Dzogchen is a complete systems that unifies all the teachings of the nine yānas into one yāna, so nothing is excluded. People have gained the wrong impression because of an over-emphasis on an apophatic approach. And because, frankly, there are many people selling Dzogchen teachings who do not have the qualifications to give these empowerments, which means they are not qualified to give Dzogchen teachings.

One cannot confirm vidyā in direct perception on the basis of sems sde instruction, one can only confirm the reality of the mind.

However, for someone who has received these instructions, the whole of Dzogchen can even be discerned in mahāyoga tantras such as the Guhyagarbha, Hevajra, and so on, but not without them.

Could we make distinction though between garab dorjes introduction and later padmasambhava mahayoga instructions as non gradual vs gradual Dzogchen?

Malcolm wrote:
No, we cannot. In fact, the Three Phrases are part of the Vima Nyinthig, and typically would only be given after someone had received the four Nyinthig empowerments.

There is a useful distinction in the Mutig Trengwa and the Rig pa Rang shar Tantras: they basically state there are (1) the empowerment of
pristine consciousness for those who understand and (2) the empowerment of colored powders for those who do not understand. The latter tantra further specifies that there are additional empowerments for the former kind of person: (1) the empowerment of the appearances of a sentient being, (2) the empowerment of the mental focus of a meditator, and (3) the twenty-one introductions.

Khenpo Ngachung specifies that the four Nyinthig empowerments are basically an elaborated form of the fourth empowerment.

The 18 sems sde empowerments are the empowerments of the mental focus of a meditator. The various direct introductions one sees used these days are variations on number 2. it is important to understand this point to avoid the fault of claiming that in Dzogchen no formal empowerment is needed. The Rangshar states in chapter 8:

Danny said:
“The faults of not obtaining the empowerment are as follows: In the bardo one is alarmed, panicked, exhausted, impeded, and one can also lose consciousness.

“While one has not yet left the body of traces, migrating beings will not see one as worthy of respect. One’s merit will be small, one’s life short, one’s enjoyments of living will be few, one will be powerless, and many obstacles will occur. Nothing will be accomplished. Those are the faults of not obtaining the empowerment for the conduct of secret mantra. A yogin of secret mantra conduct must first obtain empowerment. If empowerment is not obtained, not even the Buddha will be able to turn the wheel on the stage of a tathāgata. If the wheel cannot be turned, then the nirmāṇakāya will not be able to benefit migrating beings with compassion. Therefore, the empowerment of the conduct of secret mantra must be obtained.”

Malcolm wrote:
Therefore, we can understand that the meaning of direct introductions, etc., are the same in meaning as the fourth empowerment, etc.

I guess it depends on if you view Dzogchen through the lens of the Buddhist sciences, and like the approaches and compartmental stages and empowerments and so on. That's fine.

Sure, they're not black, but societal injustice isn't a competition, the fact that other people suffer doesn't negate your suffering.

Hi,

lately I have been introduced to and gotten lung for the practice od King Gesar as a dharmapala. And quite frankly I don't know much about him and there does not seem to be much on the internet about him (especially when one ignores the shambhala as a source). When did King Gesar first appear as a dharmapala? I know that Mipham discovered a sadhana for him. Is he seen as a standard dharmapala? Was king Gesar even real? I just find it a bit strange that this quite violent warrior from a popular folktale is considered an emanation of Guru Padmasambhava and a dharmapala.

Malcolm wrote:
The first evidence we have of Gesar at all is in a text called Lang Poti Seru (roughly 1450), which sites Gesar in the late 10th to early 12th century as a local chieftain in the Ling region of Eastern Tibet.

The modern day tradition of Gesar as a dharmapāla begins with an 18th century terton, Lha Rig Chen po's Gesar, the King of Vajra Life.

MIpham's terma of Gesar, which is based on the above, has Gesar as guru, yidam, and dharmapāla, as does Khenpo Jikphun's Gesar cycle. I don't know about Namkhai Drime's Gesar cycle. Mipham's cycle is very rich with many texts for divination, Sang, Lungta, etc.

Gesar is very important, for example, the Horse Race ballad conceals a presentation of the Dzogchen path, based on the commentary of Mipham.

Personally, I am quite comfortable with the ambiguity of Gesar. People do not hesitate to propitiate Achi, they also should not hesitate to propitiate Gesar. It can bring nothing but benefit.

One of my colleagues is black, born and raised here in Switzerland and she has some amazing stories, ranging from nasty to facepalm. Once one of her kids came home from kinder looking a bit serious. So after some quizzing, he told her that they had a clown come and the clown, when needing a member of the audience, called out to him as 'the chocolate-coloured kid in the back'. As the only black kid in the group, he was made understandably uncomfortable and she tried to speak with the kinder staff and the clown and explain how that felt. She didn't raise a ruckus and demand that the clown be fired, she just wanted to tell her story. Mind you, she grew up in much more racist times in what was a 99.99% white city. That of course colours not only the way you are seen but the way you see how you are being seen.. It's tricky. The clown was not being a bigot. He was simply clueless. And that why sharing stories is important.

Who is doing the excusing or not excusing? Do you have that moral high ground, Malcolm? I don't. We can say that it's not OK. That's fine. I can teach my kids that certain kind of language and jokes are not OK (and I do). But at the end of the day, human beings are mixed bags with messy contradictory characters. What I find to be more valuable is to hear out people's stories and begin to understand how it is for them.

Malcolm wrote:
Hi Dan:

What I understand is that the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada were all founded on the principles of white supremacy. The preamble of the Constitution of the United States begins "We the people of the United States...," but the people did not include women, African slaves, Native Americans, and still do not.

I also understand that conservatism is a political philosophy which is predicated on white supremacy and always as been:

"According to Burke’s code, slaves of impeccable manners and behaviour should have a right to buy their freedom at “rates to be fixed by two Justices of the Peace”, though he fails to suggest where they might find the money. A renowned advocate of individual liberty, Burke nevertheless thought that despite being committed slave owners, the “people of the southern (American) colonies are much more strongly…. attached to liberty than those to the northward”[14]. In his fascinating “Counter History of Liberalism” Domenico Losurdo describes Burke as “the tutelary deity of the slaveholding South”."

https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/opende ... -villainy/

With respect to Burke's heir, principle among them William S. Buckley:

"In its earliest days, National Review defended Southern segregation in euphemistic terms. Buckley published articles by highbrow segregationists praising the conservative South as a check on liberalism. In perhaps its most infamous editorial, National Review asked whether whites should dominate in the South. Its “sobering answer”? Yes.
https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/ ... sion-race/

Of course, Buckley, being an intelligent man (someone with whom my mother, an arch-liberal if there ever was one, civil rights activist, first-wave feminist, etc. was in fact friends, and someone whom I met as a toddler, though I have no memory of it) changed his position to the present, absurd idea of "color-blindness" common in conservative circles these days:

Colorblindness served conservative purposes. It allowed not only conservative writers but politicians like Barry Goldwater to oppose civil rights legislation from a “race-neutral” standpoint, in line with broad American values. They could always point to a higher principle than racism — whether constitutional or otherwise — to explain their opposition to black demands for equality...William Rickenbacker, another editor, argued that the magazine was best when it “bravely” said “the things everyone knows.” These “givens” included that “white people and Negroes do not actively seek each other’s company” and that “the bastardy rate” among blacks threatened “their claim that as a race they are ready to hold up their end of the social and legal structure of this country.” He demurred that this wasn’t a moral claim, merely a demographic one.

The strategies outlined at this meeting — legal colorblindness, law and order, free market dogmas and frankness about racial “realities” — were the go-to approaches for National Review and the burgeoning conservative intellectual movement for discussing race.

This last sentence remains the conservative and GOP approach to these issues. But what are they predicated on? Why of course, Edmund Burke once again:

Good order is the foundation of all good things. To be enabled to acquire, the people, without being servile, must be tractable and obedient. The magistrate must have his reverence, the laws their authority. The body of the people must not find the principles of natural subordination by art rooted out of their minds. They must respect that property of which they cannot partake. They must labor to obtain what by labor can be obtained; and when they find, as they commonly do, the success disproportioned to the endeavour, they must be taught their consolation in the final proportions of eternal justice. Of this consolation, whoever deprives them deadens their industry and strikes at the root of all acquisition as of all conservation. He that does this is the cruel oppressor, the merciless enemy of the poor and wretched, at the same time that by his wicked speculations he exposes the fruits of successful industry and the accumulations of fortune to the plunder of the negligent, the disappointed, and the unprosperous.
https://socialsciences.mcmaster.ca/econ ... france.pdf

A perfect example of blaming poor people merely for being poor, as well a clear indictment of the principle of social welfare as a depredation upon the very people social welfare is intended to assist. Here we find the nascent seed of Reagan's welfare queen, and our own Rinchen Samphel's racist rant about black people (admirably rebutted by PeterC), which we can easily read above.

Conservatism is predicated on a Calvinist notion that success is a result of divine providence, and to be successful in spite of meager beginnings is a sign that one has been blessed by providence. Burke is not revolutionary here, since he embraces this principle very clearly. If you are rich, you deserve it, since it was afforded to you by God, and if you are poor, well, behave and you might go to heaven. It is no wonder that Christianity and conservatism go hand in hand.

There is a danger that Buddhists can succumb to the same kind of theistic thinking with respect to karma. I know of racist Tibetan teachers who assert that black people are black because of their negative karma. Of course, such thinking is ridiculous and immoral.

And this is the point: some views are immoral. What kinds of views? Views that claim that some people are intrinsically better than others because of race, creed, gender, or sexual preference. Equally immoral are views that diminish the very real, global harm of modern capitalism, which is predicated and built upon white supremacy. In the US, this history is visible everywhere.

While the framers of the US Constitution were themselves advocates of white supremacy, the language of the constitution permitted slow progress in overcoming the US's own twin original sins: genocide and slavery. But these stains on our national history have not been completely erased. We still have much to do, and it is a process of centuries, not decades. And it seems we always take two steps backward for every step forward we take. The fact that unarmed black men are murdered daily in the United States and that native women are exploited as sex workers in man camps, etc., and regularly raped and murdered by white men is appalling. Native people are more likely to suffering violent crimes (70 percent of all incidents)  at the hands of white men than blacks and white men. Federally recognized tribes do not have jurisdiction over over non-Indian perpetrators, even for crimes committed on reservations. So you can see, racism is the US is still a huge problem, and I have little sympathy for white people who claim they have no privilege in our society.

White privilege was granted to poor whites as long ago as the 1705 Virginia Slave Codes, which formed the basis of the laws against "miscegenation," etc., and made it illegal for anyone other than white Christians to purchase Christian white slaves. Following this, other laws were passed in order to grant privileges to landless whites to ensure their fidelity to the wealthy white colonial authorities in the South. The act largely favors indentured servants, which imposed a time limit on obligatory service if they were christian in their native country, apart from Turks and Moors who could prove they were not slaves in England or any other Christian country. All other non-christian peoples brought to this country were automatically considered slaves in Virginia.
https://www.encyclopediavirginia.org/_A ... laves_1705

So, Dan, I think you really do not understand what we mean by "white privilege" in the United States. I think you are lacking context, and therefore, you make uninformed pronouncements such as:

Dan74 said:
To me the notion of privilege based on colour is a ham-fisted approach to redress past injustice and present inequality.

Malcolm wrote:
So just to make it plain for you: "white privilege" means the privilege all white people in the US experience, no matter how poor or disadvantaged they may seem, because of our deep history of codes, laws, and local ordinances that systematically elevate the rights and opportunities of white people at the expense of blacks and native peoples in the United States.  That's what white privilege is, and that is what is means.

To an extent I agree. But to me, no matter how egregious the views, that's not a deal-breaker. On the one hand, actions speak a lot louder than words. And on the other as long as the other person is prepared to share and listen, then I am prepared to engage in a respectful manner.

As a little kiddo, I grew up in the Ukrainian hinterland where anti-Semitism of the most virulent kind was normal. My parents taught me to be grateful to people for not being anti-Semitic and hold them in high regard (kinda in Uncle Tom fashion). My mother was especially subjected to it because she looks quite Mediterranean. Then even in Australia, two Russian colleagues were racist with one regularly making nasty anti-Semitic remarks and jokes in my presence. But when it came to crunch, he actually was very helpful and decent to me. People are funny like that.

Thanks for catetorizing me based on my skin color, so un-racist of you. The reason why i have the views i do, is because sitting around being a victim wouldnt have put me in college (back in school for the first time in 10 years), wouldnt have gotten me a job as a union laborer, and thats a lot better than sitting around thinking my dad or bullies owe me something. Sitting around being a victim 24/7 wont get you a life, society wont change for you or anyone else, you will only die a victim who has nothing more than resentment.

It is interesting how people on the right always frame things in terms of victimology. You claim not to be a victim, and yet you wear victimized resentment as a badge of pride, not even noticing that if you were a black man with the same set of social conditions, it would have been much harder for you to pull yourself up, because the deck is that much more stacked against you. In other words, you claim not to be a victim, but you talk like a victim ( which is common in the alt right and fellow travelers). And yet, when black people do get upset and protest and struggle against the obvious disadvantages they have, which frankly, are much more acute than what you’ve experienced in life, people like you marginalize their struggle against racist oppression as if it is just a fantasy. Well, it isn’t a fantasy at all. You have never experienced racism, so you really don’t know what it feels like. Unlike me, you have no members of your family that have experienced racism from white people, so you really have no clue, like the rest of the MAGA crew.

The kind of Zen talk that we often see aped in online forums is the encounter dialogue between masters and their disciples that can be found in many texts. These were not originally word soup, and did not occur among people who lacked an understanding of basics.

But the problem obviously is not that we have an over-abundance of Zen masters using true living words in that manner.

There’s Only One Possible Conclusion: White America Likes Its Killer Cops:

Unknown said:
George Floyd was murdered by Minneapolis police in broad daylight over Memorial Day weekend. We know he was murdered because video shows Floyd handcuffed and pinned under the knee of an officer who was crushing his throat into the pavement. Floyd could be heard telling the officer that he couldn’t breathe. He could be heard telling the officer, “Don’t kill me.” Onlookers were heard begging the officer to stop killing the man.

The police didn’t stop. The police are never going to voluntarily stop killing black and brown people. The killings will continue until the majority of white people in this country make the killings stop.

The police work for white people, and they know it. White people know it too. Deep down, white people know exactly who the police are supposed to “protect and serve,” and they damn well know it’s not black and brown people. We saw some video of that too, over the weekend. Amy Cooper was walking in Central Park with her dog. Her dog was off its leash, in violation of park rules and city ordinances. A bird watcher, Chris Cooper, who happens to be black, asked her to follow the rules. Instead of just putting her dog on a leash, Amy decided to use Chris’s race against him. She first threatened to call the cops, and then did just that, claiming that an “African American man” was “threatening” her in the park.

The very instant that Amy Cooper felt she needed the support of institutionalized racism to get her through her morning, she knew exactly where to find it. She knew exactly whom to call. Amy Cooper was the one in violation of the rules. Yet there she was, calling the cops. No doubt, it wouldn’t have even occurred to her to call them to the scene of her lawlessness if not for the way cops tend to harass, jail, and, yes, murder people who look like Chris Cooper. Or George Floyd. Or Eric Garner. Or Terrance Crutcher. Or Alton Sterling. Or Emantic Fitzgerald Bradford Jr. Or Amadou Diallo.
When Amy Cooper threatened to call the cops, she was threatening to take a black man’s life. It’s a threat that only works because cops are so consistently willing to murder black and brown men. Amy Cooper was able to dial up 400 years of racial oppression and violence on her phone more easily than I am able to order a pizza.

It doesn’t have to be this way. It is entirely within the scope of white power in America to rein in its police. White people could elect mayors and prosecutors who are committed to police reform. White judges and juries could hold the police accountable for their crimes. White Republicans could challenge and eventually break the power of police unions just as easily as they break teachers’ unions or any labor union that stands in the way of rapacious capitalism. If a majority of white people decided, today, that racist policing should end, we’d start seeing changes to police forces by the middle of next week.

But white people do not stop their cops. A majority of them clearly want the cops to behave this way. They want the viciousness. They want the horror. Why? It’s not just that a majority of white America probably thinks Amy Cooper did the right thing in her specific situation; it’s that they think they will one day be in a situation where Amy’s actions are justified. One day they might be alone in a park around a strange black man, and what might happen then? Sure, Chris Cooper seems like a “nice” black person, but what if he wasn’t? What if he was a “mean” or “aggressive” black person, and you were just alone in the park, illegally walking your dog? Best to keep brutal, dangerous, and racist cops around, because, hey, you never know.

White people think they might one day be Amy Cooper and want to have somebody to call, just in case. They know they’ll never be Chris Cooper. Making a society that’s safe for Chris Cooper to bird watch while black just isn’t the most important thing to a majority of white America.

Oh, a bunch of white people will be performatively outraged and saddened by Amy Cooper’s behavior. They’ll gladly participate in her online dragging. But when it comes to neutering the police so that the Amy Coopers of the world don’t have that kind of privilege and power over the Chris Coopers of the world, most of those white people will fall silent.

By the same token, white people will participate in the outrage over specific murders, like George Floyd’s murder or Breonna Taylor’s. They will join in calls to bring individual racists to account, like Amy Cooper or Gregory and Travis McMichael. But when it comes time to deal with institutional purveyors of racism, as opposed to individual bad actors, the outrage and support of the white community is not there. We see that disconnect on display now as police use coronavirus to threaten and harass black and brown people.

The Center for Constitutional Rights, the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, and the Legal Aid Society have joined an enforcement motion asking courts to investigate the New York Police Department’s social distancing enforcement during the pandemic. The legal motion suggests that the NYPD is in violation of court orders imposed on the city after its unconstitutional stop-and-frisk program. The lawyers are asking for an immediate moratorium on NYPD enforcement of social distancing orders.

Since March, 81 percent of social distancing violations issued by the NYPD have been made against black or Latinx people. And those stats simply confirm what our eyes are already telling us. We’ve all seen the pictures of white people gathered in parks as police officers politely hand out masks, but no tickets, just as we’ve all seen videos, shot just a neighborhood away, showing black and brown people getting beaten and manhandled by the cops for allegedly violating social distancing protocols.

Anybody could have seen this coming. In fact, I wrote about how this would happen once the NYPD was empowered to enforce social distancing. I don’t have a crystal ball. I’m not a wizard. I just know that cops cannot be trusted with the power they already have—and should never be given any more. Putting the NYPD in charge of enforcing social distancing was a decision that was so obviously going to lead to racially biased enforcement of the orders that one has to assume it was intentional.

Most black people know what happens when cops are given power, but we can’t get 51 percent of white people to do anything about it. We can’t get New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who centered his first mayoral campaign on his opposition to stop-and-frisk, to take a stand against the racist actions of his police force. We can’t get the white people who are willing to gather in large crowds to enjoy a spring day to gather in a large crowd to protest at City Hall.

Why would they? White people are not ignorant and they’re not blind. They see the racial bias in policing, and they know that bias benefits them. They know they’re not going to catch a beatdown for not wearing a mask. They know they’re not going to be choked to death on the street in broad daylight. They know that having racist police officers around gives them incredible power, and power makes people feel good even if they never use it. I’ve been in rooms where I’ve heard white people congratulate themselves for not calling the cops on some black person, as if declining the option to use terrorism against a black person was some kind of liberal bona fide.

Black people have tried, again and again, to end the horror of police brutality against us. We march, we protest, we educate, we vote. We teach our children a special set of rules. We produce art and literature and music documenting our pain. We start organizations and movements. And yet we can’t achieve structural change in policing because a majority of white America always sets its will against us. White people in our own communities, our alleged “friends and neighbors,” consistently vote and act in ways that empower the police and ignore their brutality against us.

White people could put their police dogs on a leash. But they won’t. And more black and brown people will get mauled and killed until white people decide to do better. More black people will die like George Floyd, because most white people want to live like Amy Cooper.

BTW, the Preamble to the IWW Constitution:


Unknown said:
The working class and the employing class have nothing in common. There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of the working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life.

Between these two classes a struggle must go on until the workers of the world organize as a class, take possession of the means of production, abolish the wage system, and live in harmony with the Earth.

We find that the centering of the management of industries into fewer and fewer hands makes the trade unions unable to cope with the ever growing power of the employing class. The trade unions foster a state of affairs which allows one set of workers to be pitted against another set of workers in the same industry, thereby helping defeat one another in wage wars. Moreover, the trade unions aid the employing class to mislead the workers into the belief that the working class have interests in common with their employers.

These conditions can be changed and the interest of the working class upheld only by an organization formed in such a way that all its members in any one industry, or in all industries if necessary, cease work whenever a strike or lockout is on in any department thereof, thus making an injury to one an injury to all.

Instead of the conservative motto, "A fair day's wage for a fair day's work," we must inscribe on our banner the revolutionary watchword, "Abolition of the wage system."

It is the historic mission of the working class to do away with capitalism. The army of production must be organized, not only for everyday struggle with capitalists, but also to carry on production when capitalism shall have been overthrown. By organizing industrially we are forming the structure of the new society within the shell of the old.

And here is this arguement, "but look back 100 yrs ago!" We cant solve this problem by bringing upon black people the sufferings of their ancesters, which they themselves never experianced. Half of my family was in france until the 1900's and the other half was in the north, poor farmers, and my great grandfather died from drinking paint thinner during the depression. Never owned slaves or took part in that, they married native americans, and got along with people just fine. Nobodies suffering is more important than anyone elses. Why should i have to pay for what i never did, 60 or 100+ years ago? Why should i have to pay for a "privilege" that i didnt ask for, or even fully believe in? Are we going to start pointing out "attractive-privilege"? You know attractive people typically have more confidence, a more heathy sex life, and aquire higher positions easier. Oooh, or what about "skill-privilege", some people just have a knack for carpentry, but we shouldnt let that overshadow this person over here who doesnt have the privilege of being more inclined towards that work. What about, i mean, i could go on. No one becomes a hero through being a victim, no one grows out of the mud through being a victim, and no one should have to pay for things they didnt do, just because of their skin color.

If you go altogether without food, we'll infuse divine nourishment in through your pores, and you will survive on that.'

It's also the same in Sanskrit: sarvasaṁskārā anityāḥ, sarvasaṁskārā duḥkhāḥ, sarvadharmā anātmānāḥ, śāntaṁ nirvāṇam

The Chinese similarly has  一切行無常，一切法無我，which is identical to the Pāli. 行 is the operative word here, which translates "saṁskārā" rather than "saṁskṛta." "All conditioned phenomena are impermanent" would read 一切有為(法)無常.

It is, of course, true that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent regardless of the above.

Joe Biden is a white man in America.

White people are proud of the genocide of the indigenous people they called “savages” because the Native American holocaust was their “manifest destiny.” They have no trouble calling themselves the “founding fathers” of an economic superpower fueled by the bloody brows and calloused hands of enslaved Africans who occupied this continent centuries before the arrival of the men who enshrined white supremacy into the American ethos.

White people aren’t inherently racist but America is.

In America, whiteness is bulletproof. It is a birthright, a vaccine and a deflector shield that has historically shielded white people from self-awareness and the recognition of anyone’s humanity aside from their own. This country convinces housewives that they should spit in the face of schoolgirls and turns laymen into lynch mobs. That’s what simply living in the cool breeze of American history will do to white people.

Because of how America is set up, if we somehow found the kindest, most compassionate white infant who ever took a breath of American air, that child would need every ounce of strength, humility and consciousness it could muster from its baby muscles to simply not be racist.

And it would fail.

Because it would still be a white baby in America.

The Madhyamaka view is that causes and effects are neither the same nor different, because a cause and an effect cannot be temporally dislocated nor can they be simultaneous. Therefore, the only thing that can explain how cause and effect functions is that causes and effects are neither the same nor different, for example, ghee from milk, etc. Naturally, this is all strictly on a conventional level. Ultimately, arising from causes and conditions is just a convention. In ultimate truth, nothing ever arose from the beginning.

If course it doesn't. The Buddha teaches anātma, not of the ātma. If you want to find out what people are saying "the ātma is," you have to leave Buddhism necessarily, because Buddhist people will only tell you what that "the ātma isn't." As far as metaphors go, I think the Tree of Jīvātma perfectly describes the naïvety of the mind who suggest such a brain homunculus lives in the branches of their mind. I think this because, as other posters have pointed out, the bird who does not eat is not like a "bird" in any way truly, and likely is an impossible being, i.e. one who only exists in story.

Of course, the intended function of the myth is to teach you about your wonderful shiny ātma syzygy, the you who is always victorious and never humiliated, who is uninjured when you are injured, etc.

Anatman is the negation of an unconditioned, permanent, ultimate entity that moves from one temporary body to another. It is not the negation of "Sam," "Fred," or "Jane" used as a conventional designation for a collection of aggregates. Since the Buddha clearly states in many Mahāyāna sūtras, "all phenomena" are not self, and since everything is included there, including buddhahood, therefore, there are no phenomena that can be called a self, and since there are nothing outside of all phenomena, a "self," other than an arbitrary designation, does not exist.

Anatman is one of the four defining characteristics (Four Dharma Seals) of a Dharma.

Any body of teaching that does not include Anatman cannot be Dharma.

So somebody out there obviously considers  the discussion of whether there is a self or not, of vital spiritual significance.

Of course. It is the negation of an absolute self, but not "the self" used as a name for the collection of aggregates.

No. True journalists have no agenda, with the opinion pages separated from news gathering.

Breitbart clearly has an agenda baked into their stories, which really aren’t designed to inform, but to persuade.

The acid test of fairness is simple: fair, journalism-based newspapers and magazines will post stories that are critical of any public figure or elected official, and they’ll save opinion for the oped pages. Biased outlets with only go after one side

Malcolm wrote:
This is because among common people, there is an ambiguity between bla and consciousness. Barbara Gerke has perhaps one of the best summaries I've yet read:

Varis said:
The meaning of bla evolves from the notion of what could be rendered
into English as ‘subtle life essence’,7 but is in fact more complex
considering the internal and external manifestations of bla, as well as
the shamanic and Buddhist historical influences that have shaped body
concepts, perception and ritual practices in the Himalayan enclaves.
Tibetan-English dictionaries offer a variety of translations for bla.8
Apart from the literal meaning ‘higher’ or ‘above’, the most commonly
adopted form of translation is ‘soul’.9 I find the translation of bla as
‘soul’, especially in anthropological works, to be unsatisfactory for several
reasons. Firstly, the notion of ‘soul’ is strongly rooted in Western
religious thought and does not reflect the numerous cultural meanings
that bla has acquired in Buddhist and non-Buddhist contexts among
Himalayan communities. Secondly, ‘soul loss’ is an anthropological
invention of the early 20th century that had appeared while studying the
temporary absence of some unidentified life force among certain cultures.
10 Thirdly, bla has most commonly been translated as ‘soul’ probably
because the European connotation of a subtle body that is capable
of leaving the coarse body has survived most prominently in the
Platonic notion of the ‘psyche’.11 Another viewpoint to be considered
also is that

the subtle body has been one of the hardest concepts in Buddhist and
Hindu thought for Westerners to appreciate, perhaps because it implies a
lack of separation between ‘body’ and ‘mind’, which Western science
has had difficulty in accepting (Samuel 1993b: 237).

I am not suggesting here that bla is the same as the Indian Tantric concept
of the subtle body, but only that a certain ethnocentrism within
North American and European intellectual circles has led to a misunderstanding
of the concepts of the body and its subtle physiologies
found among other cultures, which in turn may have supported the
translation of bla as ‘soul’.

I dont know if i am making sense, but can anyone who has more knowledge about this virus than me, give some advice, suggestions, how to go about living during a pandemic like this that doesnt seem to be going away. To balance trying to be safe and also to live some too, if that is possible. Thanks.

Our friends like Malcolm think contrary to this.

Malcolm wrote:
I am a Doctor of Tibetan Medicine, and have studied Ayurveda extensively in India.

Do you have any idea how many different kinds of meat are described in such classics as the Charaka Samhita, etc.?

In addition to that, I have studied yoga and the Yoga Sutras with Srivatsa Ramaswami, the last remaining living disciple of Krishnamacarya. He made it very clear that in Yoga, the substance of one's diet is really of no importance at all. What is important is not to eat too much, so the body remains light. There is no mention of a "sattvic diet" in the Yoga Sutras. This idea comes from chapter 17 of the Bhagavad Gita (Feuerstein, Shambhala, 2011; pg. 291):

Hermetic said:
Foods [that] promotes life, [the factor of] lucidity, strength, health, joy, and delight, [and that are] savory, rich-in-oil, firm, and heart [-gladdening]—[these are] dear to the sattva-natured.

Foods [which are] pungent, sour, salty, hot, sharp, harsh, and burning—[these are] desired by the rajas-natured. [They] cause pain, grief, and disease.

And [food] which is spoiled, tasteless, putrid, stale, left-over, and unclean—[this] is food agreeable to the tamas-natured [individual].

Malcolm wrote:
You will notice here too an absence of mention of meat. Rather, the text focuses on qualities of food. Meat can be sattvic. It just depends on how it is prepared. Finally, most people cannot live on sattvic foods alone, but need some rajasic foods for various reasons.

Finally, my point is that Tibetan texts on yoga do not recommend that one avoid meat, on the contrary, they recommend that one eats some meat in order to build one's strength and immunity, given how harsh the Tibetan climate is.

Everything is relative, including diet. It is very stupid to base one's diet on religious idealism. You have no idea how many patients I have seen who have ruined their health following unhealthy vegetarian and vegan food regimens.

When it comes to Ojas:  Is this something that is found in particular food, or is it that particular food assists us in producing ojas (like iron and folic acid is helpful for producing blood)?

Malcolm wrote:
Ojas is actually not found in food, per se. It is the final product if you will, of the seven-fold process of metabolism described in Ayurveda/TM: nutriment (rasa)-->blood-->flesh-->fat-->bone-->marrow-->seminal precursor. The last tissue, seminal precursor is then divided: the pure part becomes ojas, is concentrated mainly in the heart region, but is evenly spread through the body; the impure part is discarded as reproductive tissue in both men and women (until menopause).

The more nutritionally dense one's food is, the more ojas is available, provided these metabolic pathways are functioning properly. Vegetarians can have an ojas enhancing diet, provided they eat enough foods that are "sweet" in taste and oily in quality. Bitter and astringent foods tend to be poor supporters of an ojas-enhancing diets. Ojas-enhancing diets tend to be anabolic. There are certain instances where one will want to engage in a cleanse, which is basically a kind of catabolic diet, as a preliminary to engaging in rasāyāna, which is the consumption of herbs and foods that anabolic in nature, but which do not have high levels of ama, undigested or improperly digested foods (think arterial plaque). The downside of meat, of course, is that it can result in a lot of ama. This is why, when eating meat, it is better to eat it stewed, rather than frilled or fried.

For vegetarians, a kind of date and milk drink is very good for building ojas in depleted people. This is an excellent recipe: https://kripalu.org/resources/kripalu-r ... -ojas-milk

Flynn had pleaded guilty in December 2017 to lying to the FBI earlier that year about his Russian contacts. But in recent months, Flynn has tried walk back that plea and push allegations of prosecutorial misconduct — with his former boss, President Trump, cheering on the effort. The Justice Department’s move last month to try to drop the case is believed to be unprecedented, given the multiple occasions Flynn previously affirmed his guilty plea in court.

In appointing Gleeson, Sullivan has also asked him to examine whether Flynn committed perjury.

Gleeson told Sullivan on Monday that he would like until June 10 to file his friend-of-the-court brief addressing the question of whether the court can deny the DOJ request to dismiss the case and if so, the legal standard for doing so.

Gleeson also said by then he’d lay out “any additional factual development I may need before finalizing my argument in opposition to the government’s motion in this case.”

Gleeson did not elaborate on what areas of the factual record he may like to look at, or whether it would include how top DOJ officials went about reversing course in the case.

Finally, Gleeson told Sullivan that by June 10 he could also address “whether, based on the record before the Court, it should order the defendant to show cause why he should not be held in criminal contempt for perjury.”

Do I need a Vajrayogini empowerment to be able to do this?

Most people do not realize that the preliminary practices of the LN do not actually include the outer guru sadhana. The outer guru sadhana is combined with the ngondro text to make up what people now refer to as the LN Preliminaries.

So, there is in fact an empowerment for this outer guru sadhana, but it is not always given beforehand.

According to Abdhidharmakoṣabhaśya, a bardo being with excess desire whose fetus becomes a male fetus during the third week of gestation will likely end up becoming pandaka; one can infer that a bardo being with excess anger whose fetus remains female will become a female pandaka.

According to Ayurveda and Tibetan Medicine, gender preference is largely a biological outcome resulting from a uniform quantity of male and female reproductive tissues at the moment of conception.

The question of pandakas is really only an issue for monastic ordination. It is not a moral issue, though, naturally, there are non-gender specific issues with oral sex and anal sex described in the teachings on sexual misconduct.

I think you're putting the Dharma in a completely anachronistic philosophical framework.  Practice of the Dharma doesn't particularly need philosophy.  Of course most serious practitioners spend a lot of time on philosophical questions, but they don't really have to. However if you want to ask what the Dharma thinks about 'secular values', you need to look at the question in the context of the Dharma as expounded by the Buddha and reflected in the canonical texts of your lineage. You don't need to read Kant to understand the Dharma, the Dharma has no interest in or relation to the European enlightenment, Christianity, etc. These topics have nothing to say that adds to the understanding needed to practice the Dharma, and by trying to relate the two to each other you enter the eponymous thicket of views, fetter of views etc. The question of whether one can hold 'secular values' independent of any non-empirically-observable beliefs is something in which that Dharma took very little interest.  The Dharma of Sakyamuni did engage to some degree with the other dharmas of its day, and explained why they didn't, in its view, lead to liberation.  But that's really all that it's concerned with: suffering, the ending of suffering, achieving liberation (expressed in different forms in the different vehicles).  It doesn't need to care about anything else, really, except the basics of how to provide the conditions for practice, how to relate to society while you practice, but advice of that kind is mostly around how to do that in a way that minimizes disruption to your practice.

Malcolm wrote:
Bravo. Well done. And any way, Buddhism accounts for ethics in the context of the ten natural nonvirtues, which it considers the core frame around which all secular and religious morals and ethics are constructed.

I don’t deny the possibility of benevolent Christians.  I have just encountered too many unpleasantly intolerant ones in many different countries, and the common thread is that they want you to change your practices and beliefs - completely consistent with their belief that you are going to hell and they have a duty to save you. This drives their organized political activities. These activities are very well documented in the US, less so elsewhere but they are socially malign wherever you encounter them.

I have never encountered a scientist, engineer, doctor etc who wanted to change my practices or beliefs, beyond the occasional casual conversation over drinks where they ask if I really get a lot out of visualizing myself with multiple heads and arms drinking blood from a skull cup.  Which, to the uninitiated, is actually a pretty reasonable question.

I just think attacking the straw man of secular ideology is extremely Quixotic - in the true sense of the word. We’ve had centuries of organized religions persecuting non-believers.  Why would we ever want to make common cause with them.

But look at it this way.  Are The Secularists trying to physically stop people going to medical procedures because they think those procedures contravene their beliefs?   Are they lobbying legislatures trying to get business exempted from civil rights obligations due to their scientific beliefs?   Are they protesting anime conventions because they disrespect physics?  Are they condemning gay people to imprisonment or condoning their killing because homosexuality is contrary to accepted biological reproductive practices?  Did they burn people at the stake for claiming that the earth was flat?  Did they enslave religious people because they thought it would improve them?

I could go on but I’m sure you see my point.  It is pretty absurd to claim oppression of religious people by secular viewpoints.  Australia is for the most part a fairly rational society.  However if you go to not just the US but large parts of Africa, the Middle East, Eastern Europe, bits of Latin America even, religious majorities imposing their views on others is a real and ongoing problem.

Thank you so much to anyone who can help me with this question. This is a powerful doubt monster that has really been distracting me today.

Some history - Last year I took refuge with a lama and later did an Amithaba empowerment. There were very few requirements, but one was to try to recite the mantra, if nothing else, every day. I was in a pretty rough state during the time, and was mostly driven to do the practice through fear. As I came out of that state, I dropped the practice, as I associated it so strongly with my emotional state at that time.

Over the past few months, I have had the good fortune to connect with Green Tara practice, receive empowerment, and now do the Green Tara Sadhana practice I was taught everyday - with joyful enthusiasm! I received this from a different lama. Along with this, I practice vajra recitation as I was taught and objectless shamatha/nature of mind practice.

Today this doubt monster reared it's head while I was practicing my Green Tara sadhana - that I should be also fulfilling my requirement to do Amithaba. By taking refuge in Green Tara and practicing her Sadhana, as understand it, I am taking refuge in all the Buddhas and walking the path. But am I doing something wrong by not doing Amithaba as well? By approaching Green Tara with joyful enthusiasm, generating boddhicita, and attempting to understand her and my practice from the absolute view, I hope this is enough. My practice of Amithaba was a little tainted by my mind state at the time and I'm a little afraid to bring it into my daily practice again. Any suggestions or thoughts here are welcome!

Also hope not to hijack this revived thread, but in skimming it I'm surprised to not yet see a clear refutation of the statement that "Shingon is the Japanese branch of Tibetan Buddhism," or of the idea that there was any Tibetan Buddhist connection to the formation of Nichiren's teachings.

I am hardly qualified to be the history police. But it bears repeating: the early esoteric teachings transmitted to Japan and preserved there today did not come from, or first pass through, Tibet.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct, they were brought by Vajrabodhi and Amoghavajra to China directly from Southern India via the sea route in the late 7th and early 8th century, and it is quite likely that the influence of Chinese Buddhists at the court of the Tibetan King stimulated his interest in importing Mantrayāna to Tibet during the latter half of the 8th century.

I guess this is really my point. One can still live one's life and practice recognizing that there is a certain element of doubt.

I agree, eventually you have to overcome doubt, but I personally think the way to achieve that is through experience rather than reliance on authority or reasoning. But different people will view this differently

Edit - doubt isn't something you can simply tell people to discard ex ante.  To do so would actually most likely cause them to doubt more: it's not particularly helpful to tell someone who doubts a point of doctrine that they just need to believe and then everything will make sense. In some cases you can gain understanding through practice, for instance in the four common preliminaries. But you can't *make* yourself believe something. You don't believe that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west because someone with a PhD has explained astrophysics to you.  You believe it because you have observed this day after day and gained confidence that it is the case. Then when the astrophysicist comes and explains to you the mechanism by which eclipses happen, you find it easier to accept because you have gained confidence in another part of his general description of how objects in the solar system is arranged. That way you have gained confidence in the system and the explainer of the system.  I know this isn't a great analogy but you see what I mean.

Malcolm wrote:
"Conviction" aka faith, means you have to take someone else's word for it. Buddhadharma recognizes three sources of authority, not merely one, as some modern interpreters of Buddhism maintain. What are the three? Direct perception, inference, and testimony of reliable witnesses. These days, many people interested in Buddhism have been mislead to believe that only direct perception is a valid authority. However, this is actually the position of the Ancient Indian materialist school, the Carvaka/Lokayatis.

Bolds added. The crucial point is, the dharmas refer to 'experience' - they are elements of experience, not of an external or 'mind-independent' object, like the atoms of Greek philosophy.

Malcolm wrote:
Try telling that to the Sarvāstivādins and Sautrantikas. All these definitions are not predicated upon native definitions of the term "dharma," and none of the authorities cited for their translation equivalents using native definitions in formulating their equivalents.

The word "dharma" derives from "dhṛ," "to hold, to bear," and generally, among ten definitions of "dharma," the one relevant here is "bearer of characteristics."

So, in fact, when it comes to things like the constituents of the material aggregate, indeed, the five material objects of the five material senses are indeed held to be external or "mind-independent" objects. And, beyond the four elements, there is a further derivation of the elements into secondary or derived matter. This is all explained in the Dhātu chapter of the Kośabhaṣya.

Apparently you are not familiar with US history. It was the republicans that freed the slaves, and the democrats that started the civil war, the KKK and also attempted to ban blacks from having 2nd amendment rights. This was going on up until the 60's when they tried to shut down various civil rights movements.

Malcolm wrote:
First of all, it was only the Southern Democrats that led the secession. Among Northern Democrats there were two factions: War Democrats who supported Lincoln's military policies, and Copperheads, who opposed them. Already, during the formation of the Republican party in the 1850's, many Northern Democrats joined it. Not only this, but in 1864, the Republican Party and the War Democrats formed a Unionist Party, called the National Union Party, to re-elect Lincoln. It fell apart right after the Civil War when most Republicans abandoned it.

So, are we living in the era pre-1965 or post 1965? The reason I ask is that as far as I know, there was a realignment in the late 60's, causing racist Southern Democrats to switch their allegiance to the GOP, which in turn allowed Nixon to succeed in his election bid by using the so-called Southern Strategy. This of course means that now the GOP is the party with the most KKK in its DNA.

That being said, since the 1930's, Northern Democrats were the union party, liberal, and devoted to FDR's New Deal. Republicans on the other hand were the business party, and largely in opposition to the New Deal, and later, the Great Society.

The KKK was generally opposed to unions, especially integrated unions, and generally opposed the New Deal. Under FDR, the Democratic Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act in 1935. We can understand that Southern Democrats were generally opposed to the New Deal.

Prior to Reagan, there were conservatives in both parties, who formed what was known as the Conservative Coalition, which dominated Congress until the 1970's, and who opposed and undermined the New Deal as much as they were able.

Since Reagan, conservatives have largely moved into the GOP silo, while liberals have moved into the Democratic silo.

So, characterizing the modern Democratic and Republican Parties in terms of their pre-1965 and 1980 history is excessively misleading, since it is complicated, and cannot be simply quantified into two sections: Democrats = KKK; Republicans = 13th Amendment.

In fairness, you should read Heather Cox Richardson's How the South Won the Civil War:

tingdzin said:
While the North prevailed in the Civil War, ending slavery and giving the country a "new birth of freedom," Heather Cox Richardson argues in this provocative work that democracy's blood-soaked victory was ephemeral. The system that had sustained the defeated South moved westward and there established a foothold. It was a natural fit. Settlers from the East had for decades been pushing into the West, where the seizure of Mexican lands at the end of the Mexican-American War and treatment of Native Americans cemented racial hierarchies. The South and West equally depended on extractive industries-cotton in the former and mining, cattle, and oil in the latter-giving rise a new birth of white male oligarchy, despite the guarantees provided by the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments, and the economic opportunities afforded by expansion.

To reveal why this happened, How the South Won the Civil War traces the story of the American paradox, the competing claims of equality and subordination woven into the nation's fabric and identity. At the nation's founding, it was the Eastern "yeoman farmer" who galvanized and symbolized the American Revolution. After the Civil War, that mantle was assumed by the Western cowboy, singlehandedly defending his land against barbarians and savages as well as from a rapacious government. New states entered the Union in the late nineteenth century and western and southern leaders found yet more common ground. As resources and people streamed into the West during the New Deal and World War II, the region's influence grew. "Movement Conservatives," led by westerners Barry Goldwater, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan, claimed to embody cowboy individualism and worked with Dixiecrats to embrace the ideology of the Confederacy.

Richardson's searing book seizes upon the soul of the country and its ongoing struggle to provide equal opportunity to all. Debunking the myth that the Civil War released the nation from the grip of oligarchy, expunging the sins of the Founding, it reveals how and why the Old South not only survived in the West, but thrived.

ItsRaining said:
The book while I haven't read the whole thing, seems to have a lot a problems in the later section on Chan Buddhism. He quotes Zongmi and Yanshou

Zongmi
[This true] nature is like space; it is not to be added to or reduced. There is no need to add [virtues]. Once one stops karmic action but fosters shen at every time and everywhere, the embryo of sainthood develops and manifests its natural mystery. This is true awakening, true practice and true realization.

The author says Zongmi can be read as either advocating for a self like some pre 5th century Buddhists or one that is more in line with post Zhiyi Buddhists that understand the more orthodox position on self but I don't since the former reading is possible if Zongmi's other works are cited.
Zongmi's own explanation of the "true nature" which in his commentary on the Awakening of Faith he clarifies is not a "self" but rather emptiness. Here's one section where he uses the Three Natures to explain the true nature. (True is also a way of saying Suchness since they are written the same way in Chinese) Since Zongmi explains the true nature to be emptiness and permanence is said to be non-changing as the emptiness doesn't arise or perish I'm not sure how it could be in line with the author's view on how Self is exppained by earlier Buddhists.

Also, fostering shen is a stock phrase in Chinese that means to be at rest, the author didn't seem to mention this.

Why is the deluded nature said not to neither arise or perish? It is because there is no dharma to arise nor perish like the snake imputed on a rope. The dependent nature arises yet does not arise and perishes yet does not perish like the rope  imputed on hemp. The perfected nature is the middle without the two kinds of dharmas previously mentioned like hemp with neither rope or snake imputed.... From leaving the previous attachments of self and dharms this perfected is suchess so it is said to not be arising or perishing.....

So the Perfect Awakening state: the nature of extinction of the Tathagatas is without start or end. Hence the next line state: The nature of mind is neither arising or perishing and it neither arises in a previous moment nor perishes in the next and it permanent. This is the explanation on the non-change of the true mind.

Yanshou:
Being attached to illusory suffering, one seeks liberation; wishing forthe [intellectual] capacity of saints, one attempts practice. However,
all these are actions of the illusory self, i.e., discrimination by sensory consciousnesses. For this reason, when the Great Hero appeared
[in this world], he showed only the correct tenet: destroying the illusory self, [he] revealed the gate towards the true self; rejecting sensory consciousness, [he] directed [living beings] to the way towards pure consciousness. The true self and pure consciousness are equality [as taught in the *Ratnakàrandaka-vyüha\. By means of pure consciousness, one eliminates discrimination; [by means of] the true self, one is not attached to the senses. Since discrimination has gone, differences disappear by themselves; since there is no sensory attachment, equality appears by itself.19 In short, the concept of self in Chan Buddhism
The book says in Chan realising true nature or Buddha is the same as realising a real self that is the essence of mind and the agent of though and creation here citing Yanshou, however, this is not what Yanshou or Zongmi previously defines essence of mind or Buddha Nature. Previously Zongmi defines the true nature as emptiness - a lack of arising and perishing in dharmas so it can be that this is a agent of mind. Unless the quality of not arising could think. Yanshou defines essence of mind the same way.

To say the essence of mind is a kataphatic explanation. Since all dharmas are without essence, this is the true nature of mind. Essence is therefore essencelessness, this is a apophatic explanation.

So Yanshou does not define nature of mind as something that can be said to be Self unless having a lack of svabhava is defined as self. In the Zong Jing Lu he rarely brings up the terms True Self or Shen the author seems to be cherry picking one paragraph from the whole text. He only brings it up since he was explaning on Buddhas teach according the attachments of the students so that he teaches no-self but also self at times, Yanshou then uses it creatively as descrbing the true mind since the Buddha used it to describe Nirvana.

Had Yanshou actually been concerned with a true self or shen he would have written about it in the other fasicles of the text but instead in the areas focusing on true nature, mind or "pure consiousness" he wrties about how it is empty, withou svabhava, fixed characeristics, etc

I recall reading medieval primary texts (in translation), can't remember if Chinese or Japanese, but they seemed to be aware that transmission was confused in the earlier centuries of Buddhism's introduction to China particularly because translations often relied on Daoist terminology, and also because the translators were self consciously presenting Buddhism as a contrast to Daoism. IIRC, the argument went that the encounter with Buddhism actually provoked Daoist thinking to become more sophisticated in response to Buddhism, surreptitiously adopting Buddhist ideas in the process - I think the language used was to accuse Daoists of stealing the ghee. I think the comments were made more generally as a way to praise Kumarajiva and his translations into Chinese, which the author argued was a correct transmission.

My point is, what we think of as consciousness that we think makes us so different from plants, is, on closer analysis, not all that different from a plant turning toward light in many respects. What we think distinguishes us is a very narrow category of actions.

Malcolm wrote:
Consciousness distinguishes us from plants, rocks, and so on. Sentient beings have volition, thus, they possess karma. Plants have no consciousness, thus they do not possess karma.

The Buddha himself drew a clear distinction between sentience and non-sentience.  For example, in the Ratnakaraṇḍa Sūtra, the Buddha says:

With respect that, while the cessation of ignorance may not occur in the past, future, or in the present, nevertheless, any improper thinking produces ignorance. On the other hand, if there is discerning thinking because of proper thinking, [ignorance] will not be produced. That absence of production is a total cessation, therefore, it is called "cessation of ignorance." In that case, proper thinking with respect to this body, which is produced from the four great elements, is as follows: This body is inert, discerned to appear like grass, trees, walls, and stones. Whatever is called mind, intellect, or consciousness is immaterial, cannot be shown, is unimpeded, cannot be cognized, and is like an illusion or a dream. [The mind, etc.,] cannot be perceived inside [the body], outside [it], or both.

Thus, drawing a conclusion that because plants exhibit the same kind of autonomic functions as an animal's body, and therefore plants must have consciousness too, is not a good argument to make for the sentience of plants. The Buddha treated the body itself as inert, insentient, and so on. This point is really brought home when you look at the Tibetan term for body, "lus," which means "leftover," in this case, the body (rūpa skandha) is left over when the five aggregates disintegrate at the moment of death.

He is, characteristically, describing what certain people, people of inferior capacity ( dbang po dman ) must do, before they can enter the actual path of Dzogchen, which is taking pristine consciousness ( ye shes ) as the path.

It should always be kept in mind that many of the Mahayana ideas developed from or against Sarvastivada doctrine. In this case, the Sarvastivada abhidharma teachings say that production/birth (jati), duration/staying (sthiti), deterioration/death (jara), and impermanence (anityata) are characteristics (laksana) that are dharmas themselves, and dharmas are what have self-existence (svabhava), and it is the Sarvastivadin interpretation - or what its opponents, the Mahayanikas understood the Sarvastivadin teaching to be - that for instance Nagarjuna argues against when saying that arising, duration, etc., do not exist, i.e. not really, not on their own as unique entities.

Arising, duration, and cessation are merely conventions we use to describe the appearance and disappearance of entities; but ultimately, "arising from causes and conditions" cannot be established as being anything other than a convention.

18. We state that whatever is dependent arising, that is emptiness. That is dependent upon convention. That itself is the middle path.

On my search I found at least one article about the specific role of trees in Buddha's life. It doesn't dare to talk about sentience though.
But if a plant is that important, it might imply a certain form of intelligence at least. Wherever this originates. When the Buddha was born, he assumed his human, material form; when he attained enlightenment, he achieved a higher spiritual level; when he died, he shed his physical form and fully entered the spiritual realm. A tree was present at each of these moments, serving as an arboreal bridge between our material realm and enlightenment.

Long Beach Monastery, facing the Pacific Ocean, is the second Buddhist Way-place that the Master established in southern California, after Gold Wheel Monastery in Los Angeles. On October 23, l994, the weather was ideal. At 8:00 am twenty-one Buddhist disciples who were preparing to shave their heads, along with 300 other Buddhists, participated in a bowing ceremony, which preceded the ceremony for entering monastic life.
Among the twenty-one people who resolved to leave the home life, four were male and seventeen, female. They came from Finland, Canada, the United States, China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and Vietnam. Their ages ranged from six to seventy-two.
Following the ceremony for entering monastic life, the transmission of the three refuges, five precepts, and ten novice precepts were held in the afternoon. During these ceremonies a special overseas call came from China

A CAMPHOR TREE WAITS 1989 YEARS TO TAKE REFUGE
to the Master. The Master’s disciple, Upasaka Yang, related the following true account:
When my father and I were visiting Potola Mountain, at Universal Salvation Monastery, we saw a camphor tree that was so huge it would have taken ten people hand-in-hand to encircle it. That tree spoke to me, saying it wanted to take refuge with the Venerable Master Hsuan Hua. I found this quite odd and asked the tree, “You’ve been in this monastery for so many years. Haven’t you met a true cultivator and taken refuge? Why do you want to take refuge with the Master?” The tree said that he had never met a real cultivator with whom he could take refuge, that the conditions had not ripened before, and that now he hoped to take refuge with the Master. I said, “Fine! Wait until I ask the Master. I’ll let you know.”
Later, I went back to my room and fell asleep, exhausted. When I woke up, I had forgotten all about this matter. I had neither told my father nor asked the Master about it. We were going to visit other monasteries in the afternoon. When we got downstairs, I turned around to talk to my father. All of a sudden, I sprained my neck. Fortunately, it did not break. I was immediately alert, “What did I do wrong?” Just as I was pondering, I turned around and saw the big camphor tree and instantly realized that I had forgotten to do what he had asked me to do. Just then, the tree said to me, “How could you be so careless and forget what I asked you to do?”
“I’m so sorry! My memory is very poor. Please don’t be upset. I will ask the Master now.” So I asked the Master for instruction.
The Master said, “Whether or no he becomes my disciple is not important, but he should diligently cultivate precepts, samadhi, and wisdom and put to rest greed, hatred, and delusion.”
I relayed the message to the camphor tree and added, “As long as you can observe the Six Principles of the City of Ten Thousand Buddhas: no

fighting, no greed, no seeking, no selfishness, no pursuit of self-benefit, and no lying, then even if you don’t have the affinities to meet the Master, you will still be the Master’s disciple. The tree promised to do as told. He further vowed to imitate Guanyin Bodhisattva in making the resolve to universally save living beings in the future. Right then, I saw the tree turn into a monk, kneeling on the ground with hands folded, and Guanyin Bodhisattva appeared above him and anointed the crown of his head with pure water from a vase. I was deeply touched. I reported this matter to the Master after we got home. The Master took it seriously and asked me to get more details about the tree. His name is Ren Neng (Humane and Able). I asked him what his method of cultivation was. He said he has been reciting the Heart Sutra and investigating the principles in that Sutra. However, since he lacked the guidance of a good teacher, he had not fully understood it.
Since Upasika Yang is a sincere Buddhist who possesses the spiritual power to communicate with other species, the camphor tree made the request to take refuge with the Master through her. From now on the tree will receive guidance from a bright-eyed wise advisor. Upasika Yang asked the tree how he knew about the Master and why he wanted to take refuge with the Master. The tree said it was very simple: all living beings can hear the Master speaking Dharma. When the Master speaks the Dharma, all living beings throughout empty space and the Dharma Realm can see and hear the Master. However, people who are burdened by wealth, worldly things, fame, and desire for riches may look and listen, but they fail to see and hear. All other living beings are quietly cultivating, steeped in the sound of the Master’s Dharma, nurturing their seeds of Bodhi. So the tree had been listening to the Master’s Dharma for a long time.

Today someone asked me if flowers are not sentient, ow can they make sounds? This is a good question, so now I will explain it clearly. Trees and plants have no feeling. Although they are without feeling they do have a nature, the nature of life. What is the nature of life? It is the life-energy (jen) discussed in Confucianism. This life-energy is a nature, and this nature can be said to be the Way. It can also be called the mother of the ten thousand things. Do humans have life-energy? Of course they do. If they were without it, then they would not be called humans. If they were not called humans, then what would they be called? You can call them anything you wish. For a human to have life-energy means to be human, or to speak it more correctly, “to be of the Way.” The phrase “life-energy” was coined by Confucius, and all plants and trees possess it. How can you say that plants and trees have life-energy? In the spring their limbs, branches, and leaves grow, flowers blossom and fruits come forth. This is because they have the nature of life. Not only do they have the nature of life, all plants, flowers, and trees have a minute amount of knowledge. So someone asked me, “When you cut a flower it emits a sound which we cannot hear, but if you use scientific means, then it can be heard.” This is really common.

Why is it that plants and trees can make sounds? It is because they have a nature. This nature is not full, but only exists in a minute amount. For example, if a person were said to have one hundred pounds of nature, the flowers, plants, and trees by comparison, would not have even an ounce, but would have about as much as a hair. Now this is a comparison, so do not take it literally. Basically, plants, flowers, and trees do experience some kind of sensation. I have said this before.

In China, a camphor and gingko tree received the precepts. You ask, “How is it that they could take the precepts? Since they are not sentient, how is it that they can have the nature of humans and receive the precepts? This is too contradictory.”

This is not the least bit contradictory, because if you understood it, you wold see it is very ordinary. Because the trees were old and they had experienced much, and because they had lived among people in the world, gradually they acquired the nature of humans. They had life-energy. After they had life-energy, then they acquired a little feeling. Because of this feeling, they wished to take the precepts. For a long time they did not realize how many improper things they had done, but after a while, they recognized their mistakes, took the precepts, and even thought about leaving the home-life. We should be aware of this point. Not only does he cross over sentient beings, but he also crosses over those without feelings. So it is said, “both those with and without feelings can accomplish the Way.” All of them can accomplish the Buddha’s Way. It is for this reason that he is called Universal Worthy; not only does he want to save people, but he also wants to cross over all flowers, plants, and trees. How can we not admire the vastness of his practices? At their best, most people are only aware of crossing over other people, crossing over other sentient beings, but Universal Worthy Bodhisattva even crosses over those without life, and so he is called Universal Worthy Bodhisattva.

Besides the Yogacarabhumi of Asanga there are two other works with that same name! Etienne Lamotte writes in his History of Indian Buddhism, page 696 :
"Among the Indian masters who contributed  to the  formation of  the Indo-Chinese school of Yoga or Dhyana, we should  mention Samgha- raksa, Dharmatrata, Buddhasena and Buddhabhadra. Samgharaksha was a  native of Surashtra; he  was born there in the second century  A.D.; he was well-travelled and reached Gandhara where King Candana Kaniska made him  his master. He composed, among  other works,  a Yogacarabhumi, at present known through two Chinese translations (T 607, made by An Shih Kao between 148 and 170; T 606, carried out by Dharmaraksa in 284). - Dharmatrata and Buddhasena seem to have taught in Kashmir around  the beginning of  the fifth century; Dharmatrata composed  a Yogasamasanasutra, lost today; Buddhasena  wrote  a Yogacarabhumi which was translated into Chinese (T 618) by Buddhabhadra in about 413."

This too suggests that the Buddhist school of Yoga or Yogacara was larger and earlier than the one identified with Asanga and Vasubandhu.

The last chapter of the Uttaratantra talks about how Buddha Activity happens without any discernment or effort. It simply happens wherever and whenever the karma of sentient beings allows for it to happen. Just like the sun has no intentions to light up the room when you open the shades, the Buddha Nature manifests in a way that is appropriate for the karma of a certain time and place. There’s absolutely no restriction on this activity as to affiliations. It is not a considered response to prescribed prayer, although I assume some prayer is usually in the mix of karma that allows the Activity to happen.

From this it does not follow that the paths of nonbuddhists lead out of samsara. In fact this idea is explicitly denied in all Buddha's teachings.

It is also interesting to note that "rakṣasa" is also a poetic name for the southwest.

I have not seen any mention of the Supplication to the 84 Mahāsiddhas in the academic literature on the subject of Padmasambhava, so this source seems to have been overlooked by scholars researching the topic.

However in my personal practice, I allow the mythic dimension of Guru RInpoche to take precedence, since for me, that is where the juice is found.

However, since they are divorced from the vipaśyanā that understands the nature of reality, they do not even approach the path freedom of liberation from the suffering of samsara and omniscience free from both extremes by even a hair tip, even if one practices with intense diligence for a long time.

As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "It's amazing, lord, it's astounding, how deep this dependent co-arising is, and how deep its appearance, and yet to me it seems as clear as clear can be."

[The Buddha:] "Don't say that, Ananda. Don't say that. Deep is this dependent co-arising, and deep its appearance.

Mutual aid generally results in the creation of protective associations, which are the precursors to states. This is all laid out in the sutras. We are fully in the age of strife at present, and it only gets worse from here. But we try to apply palliatives as much as possible in hopes that it will stem some of the acute misery all humans will face as a result of continued, world-wide capitalist hegemony and the class-based society necessary to the functioning of capitalism.

So what these folks need to do is study under authentic teachers in authentic traditions which are faithful to the Buddha's teachings, and not the speculations of modern people who wish to fabricate a false dharma.

Regarding Batchelor, I don't really know what all the fuss is. There is a wide variety of schools and teachers available these days. According to our karmic dispositions we find one or another. He tries hard to be very honest with his claims, is no cult guru or manipulator, and I am sure some people genuinely benefit from his work, while more traditional schools would rub them the wrong way.

Johnny Dangerous said:
As I said (and Mikenz post goes into more detail on) the issue people have with Batchelor is his intellectual dishonesty, same with Secular Buddhism in general. It is dishonest to act like the things they are viewing as "supernatural" (Karma and Rebirth) are some footnote to the Pali Canon, when clearly they are quite central, regardless of one's personal conclusions.

I've personally witnessed this become an issue with newer Buddhists who have never actually cracked open a Sutta (I'm assuming, it's the only real explanation) and will insist that "magical" or "superstitious" stuff is something that is just kind of ornamental addition in the Pali Canon...even saying things like "But the Buddha never really said that much about rebirth"..or something similar.

It boggles the mind that there is someone out there helping this mistaken impression to be a thing. I've read just enough of Batchelor's work to see how someone interested in Buddhism but tending towards the skeptical generally would take it and run with it, without having the basic context to make sense of just how polemical Batchelors positions are, and how poorly they match up with...almost anything in traditional Buddhism. I mean, have you read his stuff on how the Four Noble Truths are just articles of faith?

What you end up with is people claiming that a very outlier position in the Buddhist world is somehow "more correct" than thousands of years of tradition, "because superstition". I suspect that this is what annoys people about Secular Buddhism. I doubt it's Batchleor's specific intention that people use his positions in this way, but in my experience they do.

The funny thing is, I'm all for people using Buddhist meditation and ethics "secularly", especially the therapeutic aspects. I just don't know why they'd insist on calling it "Buddhism" and getting all polemic about What The Buddha really Meant.

We can understand these so-called "yogācārins" to be different than the Yogācārins following Asanga, because for instance, Samghabhadra's commentary mentions yogācarins exactly four times, and only the context those who are meditating the impure dhyānas, as does Dignāga. Sthiramati only mentions these past masters called yogācārins eight times, and without any indication this refers to the school we presently know as Yogācāra.

To her meditation, can happen without formalizing it. I do see the points though of others, some of these teachers are throwing out the tradition, the traditional, and catering to Americans, and basically stripping these practices of all forms that have been carried over for years via tradition and made it suitable to us Americans/Westerners who do not want to work hard at this, haha.

Dharma is not about meditating. This is vastly misunderstood point. The Buddha did not meditate in order to achieve awakening. He meditated in order to eliminate the traces of rebirth he had created for himself through his past cultivation of the dhyānas of the form and formless realms. That said, there is right meditation and wrong meditation. It is important to learn the difference.

Given that it is cited by name only in post-6th century Madhyamaka and Yogacāra authors, it is unlikely that this text was authored by Nāgārjuna, despite the traditional attribution. Also, you should keep in mind it was first translated into Tibetan by Yeshe De in the 8th century, and only translated into Chinese in the early part of the eleventh century and only in one translation by Dharmarakṣa.

Maybe nonsense. Short of collapse, which is possible, I don't see consumption going down. Maybe we switch to electric cars but that's a rather minor improvement in the scheme. I don't know if these are the final numbers but with the slow down of activity, carbon emissions are down about 8% only. The explanation is that power generation hasn't slowed.

I don't see an effective way to reduce energy consumption. No one is turning down heat when it's so cheap. No one is turning off lights or turning off tvs and computers. And I see consumption only going up as the developing world continues to progress. The ideal life of the impoverished third world is not inspiring anyone. China is the model for the developing world now and that requires lots of coal.

The only energy source that can help is nuclear and that's another set of problems.

Population is something we can affect over a couple generations, gently and humanely. We just need the will to talk about it and address it.

Black, brown, and native people are dying at much higher rates in the US than the whites, and it is not because of some natural disposition to being killed by corona virus. It is because they live in more polluted communities, with less access to good jobs, good food, and good educations, which all have significant public health impacts.

So while a white person in the US may not be personally racist, we all benefit from a systematized racism. It is very obvious in the US, it may be less obvious in other countries without the kind if colonial history we have.

I rejoice in the merit of beings. 
I bear in mind the bodhicitta of the Buddhas. 
I go for refuge until awakening 
to the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Supreme Sangha.

Having generated supreme bodhicitta, 
I invite all sentient beings to practice the pleasing, supreme conduct of awakening.

Also, that claim [the fifth root downfall involves] the loss of the kunda is also not so. If it were so, householders would have the fault of not being vajra holders. Further, because this loss of the kunda bodhicitta is a samaya of the wisdom consort's gnosis empowerment to protect, it also makes no sense to mention it here.

In Jetsun Drakpa Gyaltsen's understanding, and consequently, for Sakya in general, the fifth root downfall is strictly related only to the loss of aspirational bodhicitta, but to not engaged bodhicitta, ultimate bodhicitta, or kunda bodhicitta.

So when is it an actual samaya not to lose the kunda bodhicitta? Specifically, it is when one is engaged in the practice related to the third empowerment, and not before hand. If one is not engaged in this practice, this samaya does not apply. This, at least, is now the Sakyapas understand and teach it.

Malcolm wrote:
https://www.filmsforaction.org/articles ... he-humans/

Richard Heinberg has some interesting things to say on this issue:

Kim O'Hara said:
I feel fairly confident commenting on the first of these claims, regarding renewable energy, having spent a year working with David Fridley of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to assess the prospects for a complete transition to solar and wind power.

We found that the transition to renewables is going far too slowly to make much of a difference during the crucial next couple of decades, and would be gobsmackingly expensive if we were to try replacing all fossil fuel use with solar and wind. We also found, as the film underscores again and again, that the intermittency of sunshine and wind is a real problem—one that can only be solved with energy storage (batteries, pumped hydro, or compressed air, all of which are costly in money and energy terms); or with source redundancy (building way more generation capacity than you’re likely to need at any one time, and connecting far-flung generators on a super-grid); or demand management (which entails adapting our behavior to using energy only when it’s available). All three strategies involve trade-offs. In the energy world, there is no free lunch. Further, the ways we use energy today are mostly adapted to the unique characteristics of fossil fuels, so a full transition to renewables will require the replacement of an extraordinary amount of infrastructure in our food system, manufacturing, building heating, the construction industry, and on and on. Altogether, the only realistic way to make the transition in industrial countries like the US is to begin reducing overall energy usage substantially, eventually running the economy on a quarter, a fifth, or maybe even a tenth of current energy.
Is it true that mainstream enviros have oversold renewables? Yes. They have portrayed the transition away from fossil fuels as mostly a political problem; the implication in many of their communications is that, if we somehow come up with the money and the political will, we can replace oil with solar and continue living much as we do today, though with a clear climate conscience. That’s an illusion that deserves shattering.

Malcolm wrote:
He also says:

Kim O'Hara said:
But the film does make some silly mistakes. Gibbs claims that a solar panel will generate less energy than it took to build the panel. That’s a misleading claim. Many teams of researchers have addressed the question of energy return on energy invested for solar power, and even the most pessimistic results (with which I mostly agree) say that the technology can yield a marginal energy gain. Much of that gain goes away if we have to “pay” for the energy investment entailed in providing batteries or redundant capacity. Wind power generally has a better energy payback than solar, but the location of turbines matters a great deal and ideal sites are limited in number. Assessing solar and wind power calls for complicated energy accounting, but the film reduces that complexity to a blanket, binary dismissal.

Malcolm wrote:
And:

Kim O'Hara said:
I agree with Gibbs, however, that renewables are realistically incapable of maintaining our current levels of energy usage, especially in rich countries like the US. Transitioning to electric cars may be a useful small-scale and short-term strategy for reducing oil consumption (I drive one myself), but limits to lithium and other raw materials used in building e-cars mean we really need to think about how to get rid of personal cars altogether.

Mainstream enviros will hate this movie because it exposes some of their real failings. By focusing on techno-fixes, they have sidelined nearly all discussion of overpopulation and overconsumption. Maybe that’s understandable as a marketing strategy, but it’s a mistake to let marketing consultants sort truth from fiction for us.

Malcolm wrote:
And finally:

Kim O'Hara said:
Planet of the Humans paints environmental organizations and leaders with a broad and accusatory brush. One target is Jeremy Grantham, a billionaire investment analyst who created the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment in 1997. Grantham was already a mega-rich investor before he “got religion” on environmental issues. I’ve had several face-to-face meetings with him (full disclosure: the Grantham Foundation has provided modest funding to Post Carbon Institute, where I work) and it’s clear that he cares deeply about overpopulation and overconsumption, and he understands that economic growth is killing the planet. He’s scared for his children and grandchildren, and he genuinely wants to use whatever wealth and influence he has to change the world. To imply, as the film does, that he merely sees green tech as an investment strategy is a poorly aimed cheap shot. Bill McKibben, who is skewered even more savagely, also deserves better; he has replied to the film here.

As to the merger, I was referencing this:
Śāntarakṣita founded the philosophical approach known as Yogācāra-Mādhyamika (c.q. Yogācāra-Svatantrika-Mādhyamika), which united the Madhyamaka tradition of Nagarjuna, the Yogacara tradition of Asanga, and the logical and epistemological thought of Dharmakirti.

-Wiki page on Santaraksita
That and the fact that there doesn't seem to be any such thing as Madhyamaka independent of Yogacara today, but they used to be separate, even in opposition to one another. So it appears that they have been totally merged.

Perhaps you would use a word other than "merger" to describe this?

Malcolm wrote:
You should understand that Śāntarakṣita would have been astonished by such classifications. These are Tibetan classifications dating from late 12th century and later.

Śāntarakṣita is termed a "Yogacāra Madhyamaka" by later Tibetans because he adopted the idea of appearances being mind-only (cittamatra), which occurs in several Mahāyāna sūtras.

However, Śāntarakṣita severely critiques the mind-only perspective advanced by the Yogācāra school in texts such as the Tattvasaṃgraha, and so on, as did his disciple, Kamalaśīla in the commentaries the latter wrote on his master's works. \

Is there any record of Nagarjuna or other classical Madhyamaka teachers, before the Yogacara-Madhyamaka merger, stating that one must understand the point of view of Yogacara to understand Madhyamaka?

Malcolm wrote:
No. Yogacāra really emerged only as an independent Mahāyāna school in the fifth and sixth century CE. Thus, the target of Nāgārjuna's critiques were only Abhidharmikas.

Also, there was never a Yogacāra-Madyamaka merger, so to speak.

Both Mādhyamika scholars and Yogācara scholars were working on the basis of the same sets of sūtras; but their understanding and classification of these sūtras differed.

In any case, the pre-Yogacāra scholars would be Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva. Even though the latter's text has the colophon title " The Yoga Practice of Bodhisattvas (bodhisattvayogacārya) composed in Four Hundred Verses," this has nothing to do with the later Yogacāra School of Maitreya, Asanga, and Vasubandhu.

Dgj said:
Okay, thanks. Since this is the case, we can assume that Nagarjuna and other classical Madhyamaka teachers would not have required their students to learn and understand Yogacara.

Therefore, since I am looking into learning about classical Madhyamaka, it seems reasonable to also assume that I need not learn Yogacara, as classical Madhyamaka, per it's founder and other authorities and masters, does not require a previous study of Yogacara.

Malcolm wrote:
You don't have to learn Yogacāra to study Madhyamaka. However, failing to do so will mean you will automatically be depriving yourself of a significant portion of Mahāyāna thought. But that's up to you.

I am not the dharma police etc., but maybe it is better to not say things like this on the internet. Better to take advice from ones own teacher about how life is shortened and extended etc and not read on the internet about it. If I would be new to the dharma and read people warning about life shortening effects of Phowa, I would be really put off the practice. I think it is probably very bad to make broad statements like that and broadcast them to many people one does not know. This will stay on the internet forever and people will probably read it 10 years from now.

For example, Ayang Rinpoche if I remember correctly said during the Phowa course in Bodhgaya some 6-7 years back that it will never shorten ones life and people who say that gather very bad karma and can go to hell. He said it is secterian. Even if there were textual references about it, they should be seen in context and in perspective to their intended audiences and not broadcasted out to a random audience and confuse them.

Also, why is there so many Buddhist books if they aren't helpful? If one can only learn from a live teacher?

So what do the others think about this, is it helpful for me to read Buddhist books or not? Do you think you can learn things or not from them?

I honestly thought i was learning things, gaining deeper insights when i was reading for instance Mingyur Rinpoches book about his retreat. I did not have to go on a retreat myself, to learn some of the things he was pointing out, it at least felt like that to me. Again, why write books like that and share it if one cannot learn Dharma from them?

Malcolm wrote:
There are three kinds of wisdom spoken of the Buddha: hearing, reflection, and cultivation.

You cannot hear the Dharma from a book.

I read Buddhist books for several years, took college courses on Buddhism, worked in a bookstore with literally hundreds of books about Buddhism, and so on. When I met my first teacher, His Holiness Sakya Trichen, in 1989, I realized I had not learned Dharma from those books, I had simply learned facts about Buddhism.

One can always tell people who have tried to learn Dharma from books as opposed to those who have properly studied under a qualified teacher from the way the former talk about the Dharma as opposed to the latter.

These days it is easy to gain access to proper Dharma teachings. Hearing the Dharma does not mean you have to attend in person. Online is just fine, if you cannot make it in person.

As far as Tibetan yogis go, this is because they are likely practicing gtum mo, and also living on very restricted diets for long periods of time.

But if one is not doing gtum mo, etc., practice strictly, seminal retention is of no importance. If you try to refrain from ejaculating during normal sexual intercourse, you can cause many problems for your genital-urinary tract. Women  cannot retain their reproductive tissue, why should men bother? Doesn't make sense.

shankara said:
I think it could be unhealthy if one isn't practicing any kind of meditation, the way I see it is like building up a source of energy which becomes useful through the discipline of meditation, providing fuel to open the knots in the subtle winds, but otherwise might prove destructive, fuelling only the fire of fanaticism. It's necessary to transform, not to repress, and meditation is the process of that transformation.

Malcolm wrote:
The only purpose semen retention has in Buddhist yoga is to serve as a basis for the bliss of intercourse I(which is why it is a fault to lose it). It's also completely irrelevant in the system of Dzogchen.

What you want to retain is ojas, not sukra. You have to understand the difference. One is the pure part of one's food, the other is the final waste product of digestion. Retaining semen without need is like holding in your shit and piss. It isn't healthy.

shankara said:
Ok so I know we're still way off topic, but how come retention doesn't cause any problems for monks?

It is to be represented on the stage by laughing, weeping, crying, talking, lying down, sitting, running, dancing, singing and reciting [something] without any reason, smearing [the body] with ashes and dust, taking grass, Nirmālya. soiled cloth, tags, potsherd and earthen tray as decoration [of the body], many other senseless acts, and imitation of others.

I would like to ask for some advice at this point. I am not a practicing Buddhist but have over the years read a lot of different books on Buddhism. Just recently, i read and loved Mingyur Rinpoches book about his retreat titled "In love with the world." I just re-read this book by Stephen Batchelor for the 2nd time. I have read over 10 Dalai Lama books, some Western Buddhist Teachers like Jack Kornfield, Joseph Goldstein, and Sharon Salzberg. I have read Walpola Rahulas "What the Buddha taught." I have several books on mindfulness. And several on Vipassana Meditation. A few other Tibetan Buddhist books. A few by Lama Yeshe and Lama Zopa Rinpoche. I read one by Gehlek Rinpoche. One by Sogyal Rinpoche. etc.

So it seems, after reading Batchelors book and reflecting on the replies here and also reading some of the other posts on the forum, i am just a dabbler, not a Buddhist. To be a Buddhist requires a few things it seems. Even though i enjoy reading Buddhism and find some good insights in it and resonate with the Buddha a lot and his teachings, i am not a Buddhist.

Any advice for someone like me, to get the most out of Buddhism without necessarily becoming officially a Buddhist. I probably will not have a teacher in this life, so any advice, what did the Buddha recommend for a householder who doesnt necessarily become a Buddhist? Are books like Batchelors helpful in any way for a secular Buddhist?

What interested me was his disillusionment with the Traditional approach and orthodoxy in Tibetan Buddhism, Zen, Theravada, etc. and also i did find it fascinating how he tried to put together the life of the Buddha in context, it made Buddha more real to me, a real human being, having to live in a very violent time, with Kings and spies and what not. I am not saying his portrayal is accurate, it just gets me thinking, that is all, and thinking is good i think

Sunrise said:
Batchelor is like that skeptical part of us that all Westerners have. We do have difficulty with rebirth, orthodoxy, and metaphysics sometimes. It's just part of our Western psyche. Some of us reconcile traditional Buddhist ideas with our background and some of us don't. I prefer a more traditional presentation of the Dharma, but I get where Batchelor is coming from. He's a Western who want to practice Buddhism but still has doubts; I can totally understand that.

I would hazard a guess that alzheimer’s was rare if it existed at all in ancient times.

Now with all the pollution, synthetic-chemicals, pharmaceutical-drugs, radiation etc. we’re currently exposed to....

And bad lifestyle habits, e.g.: the SAD (standard american diet) instead of eating nutrient-dense foods, snacking all day long instead of letting one’s digestive system rest as to get into ketosis-autophagy, monsanto/dow pesticides, stresses of contemporary life, not enough exercise, ad-nauseam.

It could be caused by provocations, but I doubt that in this case  we would have to look much further than the things I just listed.

Ancient urban life was filled plenty of devastating toxins and bad dietary habits as well, like cups made from lead, poor food combinations, etc. Also, the chance of living long enough to experience full fledged Alzheimer’s in most parts of the world was certainly a low probability until the past 100 years or so.

It is not a disease that is recognized as such in Tibetan Medicine or classical Ayurveda.

Were it to be recognized as such, in Tibetan medicine it would be included among the 101 karmic diseases for which no cure is possible.

Gerontology is not a strong point of either Tibetan Medicine or classical Ayurveda.

Urine-therapy has been recognized by most traditional cultures (including Ayurveda i.e. shivambu kalpa), and from what I understand, when you do urine-therapy, homeopathic levels of any sickness in one’s body are introduced to one’s immune system, similar to a vaccine.

It’s anecdotal, but one girl who got it started urine-therapy, and has seemed to kick the illness rather quickly. Maybe she already had a strong immune system, I dunno.

Now, first of all, you do not starve fevers. Your body has to have food and water in order be able to sustain the high temperatures necessary to cause the fever to break.

Secondly, from a Tibetan Medicine/Ayurvedic point of view, this virus presents many vata symptoms, therefore, one needs to counteract this with proper food. It is basically a fever caused by an external pathogen, which disturbs the blood with heat, that is aggravated by vata. This is the main reason it is causing strokes and heart attacks.

"even though being an ex-monastic in Buddhism means that one has miserably failed."

Are you sure about that? If i am not mistaken, people like Jack Kornfield, Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche, Osel Hita (Lama Yeshes reincarnation) and many others were Monks at one time, and then disrobed, no longer were monastics.

Malcolm wrote:
The point is that westerners often use the status of being an ex-monastic as a credential of authenticity and authority. If you examine the bios of many famous Western Buddhists, they often say, "X was a monk or a nun for x years..." as if being an ex-monastic was a positive credential.

But the reality is that in Tibetan culture in particular, being an ex-monk is a mark of failure. Therefore, I always chuckle when I see people advertising their status as ex-monastics as if it were part of their C.V.

That does not make it left wing. The Nazis were anti-communist/marxist from the beginning. Before Drexler founded the DAP, he was a member of the The German Fatherland Party (German: Deutsche Vaterlandspartei) (1917-1918). After it was dissolved, most of its members (1.2 million) joined the German National People's Party (DNVP), the major right wing party during the Weimar Republic.

So the Nazis were always right wing, antisemites who hated Marx more than capitalism.

The DNVP formed a coalition government with Nazis in 1931, and supported Hitlers appointment as chancellor. It dissolved itself in 1933 in favor of Nazi rule, under considerable Nazi pressure.

As for Marxism:

Grigoris said:
"The major beneficiaries of the Hugenberg press's anti-Marxist campaign were not the DNVP as intended, but rather the National Socialists who were able to portray themselves as the most effective anti-Marxist fighting force.[117]

The DNVP was declining rapidly as many workers and peasants began to support the more populist and less aristocratic NSDAP while upper-class and middle-class DNVP voters supported the NSDAP as the "party of order" best able to crush Marxism.

The usual rightwing misinformation is that the Nazis began as a left-wing party because they use the term "socialist." But such assertions ignore the complicated usage of the term socialism in 19th century political thinking. While socialism is, in general, anti-capitalist, there are plenty of reasons for the anti-capitalist sentiments frequently found in nationalist movements. Hence the term "national socialism" was coined to describe a species of right-wing nationalist anti-capitalism that was simultaneously anti-communist, that is, international socialism ala Marx.

The Nazis grew out of the anti-semitic, anti-communist and anti-capitalist, nationalist German Workers Party (Deutsche Arbeiterpartei, DAP) founded by Anton Drexler in 1919. In 1920, the DAP was renamed The National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei NSDAP). The latter name was clearly based on the former.
