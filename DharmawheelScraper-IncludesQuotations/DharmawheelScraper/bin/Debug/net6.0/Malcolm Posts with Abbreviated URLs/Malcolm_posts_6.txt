The border issue is part of a bigger immigration issue. The problem right now is that our legal quotas for immigration are not calibrated to demand for labor and secondarily demand to enter. This is why we have a border fiasco. A secure border doesn't mean an impermeable border. Rather, its to have an orderly process where people don't have to risk hiding out in box trucks in deadly heat to get over the border.

'The other-dependent nature, however,
Is the act of graspable-grasper discrimination;
It depends for its origin on conditions.'
(Trimsatika, v 21, tr Kochumuttom)

Malcolm wrote:
My definition comes from how it is read from Tibetan.

The Tibetan verse is very simple:

གཞན་གྱི་དབང་གི་ངོ་བོ་ཉིད། །རྣམ་རྟོག་ཡིན་ཏེ་རྐྱེན་ལས་བྱུང༌།

The inherent nature of the dependent is conceptuality, which arose from conditions.

Sthiramati glosses this as follows

"Conceptuality" shows the inherent nature of dependent. "Arose from conditions" shows the cause of production of the so-called "dependent...That is the imputed, the distinct nonvirtuous, virtuous, and neutral minds and mental factors of the three realms. Since causes and conditions are called "dependent," dependent is a convention for "generative." In other words, it shows arising dependent on other causes and conditions apart from itself.

So you see the dependent itself is not "dependent," it produces conceptuality, i.e. samsara, which is different than itself. If it were the same thing as conceptuality, it could not be suchness, in this case, vijnāptimatra, perception-only.

།གྲུབ་ནི་དེ་ལ་སྔ་མ་པོ། །རྟག་ཏུ་མེད་པར་གྱུར་པ་གང༌།

The perfected means the latter has never existed in the former.

Sthiramati glosses this as follows:

How is it the perfected? It is said, "The perfected is the nonexistence of the latter in the former." Since there is no change, it is the perfected. "In the former" refers to the dependent. "The latter" refers to the imputed. Conceptuality imputes the entities of apprehended objects and apprehending subjects. In this way, since there is imputation, despite the nonexistence of apprehended objects and apprehending subjects in the former, it is called "imputation." The permanent absence of an apprehended object and apprehending subject in the dependent is inherent nature of the perfected.

།དེ་ཕྱིར་དེ་ཉིད་གཞན་དབང་ལས། །གཞན་མིན་གཞན་མ་ཡིན་པའང་མིན།

Therefore, suchness is neither different nor not different from the dependent.

Sthiramati glosses this as follows:

"Therefore, suchness" refers the the permanent voidness of the imputed in the dependent, which is the perfected. Voidness is dharmatā. Dharmatā is neither the same nor different than phenomena. The perfected is the dharmtā of the dependent, therefore, one should understand that the perfected is neither the same nor different than the dependent. If the perfected were different than the dependent, the dependent would not be empty of the imputed. How is it not different? The perfected doe not become a support of purity, because [the dependent] has the nature of universal afflictions while it is the dependent. When under the power of poisonous clinging, it becomes the nature of universal affliction. However, because it is not different than the perfected, it resembles the perfected.

Sthiramati prefaces this by stating that three inherent natures in perception-only is noncontradictory. This is why we can understand there is some misunderstanding of the term "dependent." The dependent cannot itself be dependent, upon what would it depend? Nonexistent object and subjects? Instead, it is fulcrum for samsara and nirvana.

A little later he concludes, "Phenomena here are included in the dependent, the perfected is like space. Gnosis is one taste. As it is said, "nonconceptual wisdom perceives all phenomena to be like space" because the mere suchness of all phenomena is seen by the dependent."

With respect to the dependent being something substantial, a dravya, Sthiramati raises this qualm:

"If the dependent is substantial, why does the sutra show that 'All phenomena lack inherent existence, neither arising nor ceasing'?" There is no conflict." and then proceeds to discuss the three inherent natures, and the three absences of inherent nature.

Any, my point is simple, the Yogacārins clearly define consciousness as a substance, they are clearly unhappy if one denies the existence of this substance, and given the absence of another other than minds in their scheme of the universe, their presentation of mind-only in the sūtras suffers from a realist bias.

No, he is refuting Madhyamaka specifically in asserting that there is a real, existent, ineffable something which is ultimate, an actual basis of designation. No mādhyamika will accept this. Asanga's definition of emptiness is that the emptiness of a thing is always its emptiness of something else. In this case, specifically, he is asserting the existence of suchness, his "bare substance," which is only empty of names such as form, and so on. What is this suchness he is asserting? It is the dependent nature, of course, which he asserts exists ultimately. So, he does not escape the charge of asserting something compounded becomes uncompounded in the transformation of the basis. Why? Because the purification of the all-basis consciousness is the entire keystone of the yogacāra system. I will leave it here because we are going now in circles.

In Madhyamaka, the ultimate is simply the absence of inherent existence in conventional entities.

BTW, Mipham is not really helpful for you here. As I pointed out already, his interpretation of the Madhyantavibhanga is not possible in Sanskrit. One cannot simply revise rnam par rig pa to rnam par snang ba to try and harmonize MVB with Madhyamaka. It doesn't work.

For Asanga, "bare substance," vastumātram, is a synonym of  suchness.

Finally in Brunhölzl, vol.1, 192, Vimuktisena's reference to gold as an example of purity may be found. Here it is it seen that the dependent nature, the cognition that appears as the unreal or appears as real is never itself negated. And, given Asanga's references to a "bare substance' in the BBh above, one can only conclude that this ultimate is an existent cognition devoid of duality, itself ultimately established even if its contents are not, since, it cannot be nonexistent according to the Yogacāra scheme set forth by Asanga.

On that basis, I would be wary: Hinton published a translation of the Wumenguan a few years ago that...I didn't like.  Hinton's translation differs mightily from every other English translation of the text that I'm aware of.  When your translations are an outlier and you're making essentially a linguistic argument, I'm skeptical from the start.

Looking at all the major disagreements on this subject between various schools, I am starting to agree with the popular saying that comprehending Buddha nature is a difficult task even for Bodhisattvas on the bhumi.

So the safest bet will be to go with Mipham's middle path formula of Buddha nature = clarity +  dharmadhatu free from all reference points

Regarding the predating, Sandhinirmocana Sutra was dated to 1st to 3rd AD centuries almost as early as the earliest Tathāgatagarbha sūtras much like Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra and Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra. Given the uncertainty of range in hundreds of years, Its entirely unclear who was earlier, more likely both doctrines start developing in parallel to each other before each reaching their final form in 5th to 6th century.

Kai lord said:
Yes and Chinese Yogacara school eventually died as well after a short period of growth and Chinese Buddhist school like Huayan criticized yogacarins for not accepting the one vehicle doctrine among other nine criticisms. And I never believed Asanga wrote Uttaratantra

My original point is that  late period Tathāgatagarbha Sūtras like Lankavatara Sutra in 3rd century and the Awakening of Faith in 7th century continued to evolve and did integrate Yogacara tenets with Buddha nature. For the latter, it even subsumed. Nichiren school who uphold buddha nature and one vehicle as their supreme core doctrines, even create a ninth consciousness called amala-consciousness  which they equate to Buddha nature.

These developments are only of academic interest to me. In my opinion, tathāgatagarbha thought more easily integrates with Madhyamaka than Yogacāra. Longchenpa is an excellent example of this.

When old students changed tradition and gave up their daily practice commitments given to them by their Gelug vajra masters since their new root guru taught that all practices can be united into a single practice as you mention, it certainly raised eyebrows of the Gelug teachers.

But I’m a bit confused by your take on the yogacara tradition. Do you believe there is something lacking in the yogacara worldview? I spent some time drilling into it and I can’t understand why it cannot be totally reconciled with Madhyamaka. Or maybe I’m just misreading you.

Malcolm wrote:
The three own natures, parikalpita, paratantra, and parinispanna contain two problems. The first problem is how the all-basis consciousness is understood. If we consider paratantra, the dependent nature, to be the all-basis consciousness, there is an internal contradiction in asserting that something compounded becomes uncompounded in the transformation of the basis into the perfected nature, parnispanna.

If on the other hand, we considered the perfected nature to be empty of the imagined nature and the dependent nature, there is a problem of the inability to reconcile this with the inseparability of samsara and nirvana.

There are other problems with Yogacāra view as well, which mainly arise from their reluctance to accept that consciousness is also a dependent designation.

So, what do we rely upon yogacāra for? Yogacāra has an extensive explanation of the Mahāyāna paths and stages. So, we rely on Madhyamaka for view and Yogacāra for practice.

Malcolm wrote:
Actually, there is not word "energy" that corresponds to a specific word in Tibetan or Sanskrit other than nus pa/shakti. The Greek antecedents means "interior work."

In this case, air, fire, and water all possess energy, but they are not "energy." The air element in the body is not quite the same as the outer air element, as it is refined through the lungs, and so on. However, each of the five elements also possesses five elements. Even consciousness possesses the five elements. Even pristine consciousness possesses the five elements. Everything is made of the five elements, from the most gross physical entity to the most subtle layers of consciousness. There is nothing that is not made of the five elements.


Kai lord said:
The other schools of Tibetan Buddhism assert that one's ordinary body instead transforms into its real nature as gnosis light.
As in the body of light or Jalu? Some claimed the former is used in mother tantra and latter is used for Thogal and then some think the opposite is true, making me confused between the two terminologies.

Now the question is: given that there are million times more animals, fishes, crustaceans, reptiles, birds, ants other insects, than there are humans, are these all reborn at the end of the kalpa when this world is destroyed, in the higher Brahma heavens? Do they(we) all attain a body or form of a  Deva or Brahma (or a state of formlessness in Arupyadhatu) ?

Kai lord said:
There are a few existing explanations to that, if the single world system (planetary system)  is destroyed by fire up to the first Dhyana or Mahabrahma heaven, then the sentinel beings within that world system and below the second dhyana heaven will either be reborn in the second dhyana heaven that will be immune to the destruction by fire or reborn in other planetary systems or single world systems that have not yet undergone the fiery destruction.

After the eons of destruction and dissolution are over, when the single world system is starting to form again. Those beings from second dhyana heavens will descend onto the lower realms and start to repopulate those realms. The first of them to do so will become Brahma, followed by his ministers and so on.

Aemilius said:
In Abhidharmakosha bhashyam a small world system is one thousand four continent worlds (i.e. one thousand solar systems with planets). Then there are also the middle and great world systems. The AKB Vyakhya says that the thousand four continent worlds in a world system are created and destroyed at the same time. I.e.  one thousand solar systems are created and destroyed at the same time. It is not quite clear if this applies to the middle and great world systems also, based on the short quotation from the Vyakhya.
AKB does not support your view that individual four continent worlds are created and destroyed independently (of other four continent worlds in a thousandfold or larger world system.)
(AKB p. 469)

Malcolm wrote:
It and Chim only discuss the destruction  (56 times) of a given world system in chapter three. The world is destroyed up to the level of the fourth dhyāna plane, excluding it because the pure abodes are located there. I have never seen this other description of Kai's. The other three form realms are destroyed by fire, air, and water respectively.

This is more similar to the english "atheism" but, still, its not truly equivalent. Because atheism encompasses belief in God or any lower case 'gods' (which would include devas, olympian gods, etc). But in Buddhism, we believe in devas and so, under some definitions of atheism, Buddhism would not fit. This is why said it depends on how you define atheism and how you define "god". If devas don't qualify as gods, then Buddhism could be atheist, but if the word "god" can include devas, then Buddhism is not atheist. But, the term god is already pretty broad and ambiguous in English anyways. Therein lies the problem.

Malcolm wrote:
I don't agree. There are no gods in Buddhism, as conceived by Greeks, etc., where they viewed the gods as immortal. Devas are mortal, just sentient beings like the rest of us. Hence, we are atheist.

As for the vicissitudes and complexities of darshans in India, Mimamsas certainly held that atmans were permanent, etc., even if they rejected a creator god, just as Samkhya holds that atmans are permanent, etc.

We deny all of this in Buddhism. So while I agree that nastika is not a precise equivalent, it is functionally equivalent, meaning, "We reject your beliefs."

Buddhadharma is śila, samadhi, and prajñā; and prajña is hearing, reflection, and cultivating. What it is not is blindly accepting a bunch of stuff in books written down by bhikṣus with limited access to knowledge if anything further than 500 miles from where they resided, if that.

To attack the greatest omniscient teachers in Tibetan tradition, claim that the Dharma was not taught by the Buddha, dismiss the Buddha's teaching as "ancient" - even though its the same Dharma that was taught by Dipamkara and will be taught by Maitreya in the future and is currently being taught by Buddhas in all directions of space - is heterodox and has nothing to do with a reasonable understanding of BUddhism.

Malcolm wrote:
The real teaching of the Buddha will never be found in any book. Books are something relative, faulty, subject to emendation, and so on, as the any person who has studied even a smidgeon of the textual history of Buddhist texts knows. The Mahāyāna tradition is self-conscious of its revelatory status, as opposed to the oral tradition represented by the Nikāyas and Agamas. You are making a category error in assuming that provenance determines doctrinal validity. The definitive sūtras of the Mahāyāna are true because they are rational, concern emptinesss, selflesness, absence of persons, living beings, and so on, which are the hallmarks of definitive sūtras. Sūtras concerning living beings, cosmologies, and so on, are provisional. There are four criteria we follow in Mahāyāna:

Follow the dharma, not the person.
Follow the meaning, not the words.
Follow the definitive sūtras, the provisional sūtras.
Follow gnosis, not mind.

There is a great deal of difference. The Sakya system is based in an uncommon hermeneutical tradition called the "ultimate secret" (guhyānta), which is a special tradition of Naropa's not taught to Marpa.

As far as I know, the Ghantapada tradition in Drikung comes through Shridhara, rather than Marpa. It has the same source as the five deity tradition in Sakya, but a different lineage, and hence the explanations are different, mode of empowerments is different, and so on. It's does not mean one is better than the other, they are just very different expressions of the same mandala.

As for your description of the Buddha's teaching as "ancient biology",  then I cant agree with this description.  The Buddha's teaching is neither ancient nor contemporary, but it is the eternal true Dharma.  This is the orthodox Buddhist view of it, even if this is displeasing to certain modern Western Buddhists.  The principle I'd adhere to is as stated previously:

Malcolm wrote:
Spoken like a true fundamentalist. Apparently you didn’t get the memo on the distinction between provisional and definitive teachings. Things like cosmology, biology, etc., are provisional.

Your example is misplaced. Kongtrul was certainly quite knowledgable, but he never left Tibet, he never knew the world was round, that the earth revolved around the sun, and so on. These things are not necessary to know in order to attain liberation. This conversation is boring. People like you show up on Dharmawheel, all full of piss and vinegar, eager to defend ancient, outdated models as if their conventional validity is intact because they showed up in some sūtra somewhere, none of which were in fact spoken directly by the Buddha, all of which are later revelations, composed for this and that reason. To the extent that any of them are consistent with an identifiable model of liberation taught by the Buddha, we then accept them as Buddhadharma. But we do not have to accept flat earths, Sumerus, and so on. The present Dalai Lama, within my own hearing, rejects the ancient cosmology taught by the Buddha and which is present in Kongtrul's encyclopedia. Why? Because it is contradicted by empirical observation. Modern Tibetan attempts to defend this ancient cosmology, of which there are a few, are just exercises in romantic, wishful thinking. Next you will be insisting that the hell realms are located so many yojanas beneath the ground, that a ring of iron mountains surrounds the four continents in order to prevent the stink of the rive surrounding hell from killing us all, and so on.

One can’t really explain their reproduction through recourse to the old four birthplaces model, which is not fully functional as a grand theory of every type of reproduction. For example, heat and moisture birth actually describes the egg birth of insects, etc., some animals and birds are capable of parthenogenesis. We don’t need to fit modern biology into ancient biology anymore than we need to fit modern cosmology into ancient cosmology.

Also, gandharvas possess all five aggregates, and the descent of consciousness “into the womb” is intentional, not unconscious or mechanical. Please examine chapter three of the Abhidharmakoshabhasya.

I don't like the idea being propounded on this thread that western philosophy is always aimed at mere 'speculation' or 'mere intellectualizing'.

It can of course fall into such things. But so can Buddhism. In both cases, this says something about the agent doing Buddhism or philosophy, but not necessarily very much about what Buddhism or philosophy actually are.

Philosophy generally aims at truth (most contemporary philosophers I have met have this as an innate motivation, and it is a noble one). It tries to resolve intractable problems that other disciplines can't or won't try to resolve - so it is indeed pragmatic too. It has given birth to just about every other major discipline of knowledge - most of which we rely upon to fly our planes and structure our societies - so there is plenty of proof in the pudding that philosophy has not remained mere abstract theory.

So, you know, a bit of credit where it's due.

Malcolm wrote:
The aim of Buddhadharma is liberation, it presupposes a number of things foreign to what we call modern philosophy in the West. Indeed, “philosophy” as a program does not even exist in Buddhadharma. Buddhadharma does not aim for “truth for truths sake,” as conceived by westerners, an abstract principle or ideal, since it is not attainable conceptually, from a Buddhist pov.

You are conflating so called “natural philosophy,” which eventually became “science” with what we today understand as philosophy., which has largely abandoned the search for first principles.

It does not serve our purposes here to make anachronistic claims.

But all of this is really outside the scope of Buddhadharma.

The dang rolpa tsal schema is a unique feature of Namkhai Norbu's system, so youre not going to find it in the tantra or commentaries. The more typical schema is tsal, rolpa, bodhicitta as explained by Longchenpa is his Treasuries.

Malcolm wrote:
It is important to understand that Longchenpa's  byang chub sems, rtsal, and rol pa scheme is explained in order clarify that Dzogchen does not reject outer objects (rol pa). Some people in Tibet took the "sems" part to be something resembling Yogacāra idealism.

ChNN's scheme is related to the three kāyas, so completely different in meaning.

To this we can add the explanation of byang chub sems found in Kunzang Dorje's 12th century text, the Vajra Bridge (klong sde). Byang refers to purity, that's obvious. But he states very clearly:

Comprehension means (chub pa) means [6/b] 1) the comprehensions imbued with the five poisons when there is ignorance or delusion about the reality of the mind essence and 2) it means the comprehension imbued with the five pristine consciousnesses when there is knowledge and realization of that reality.

One point that the gloss "perfect" does not reach as a translation is the the definition of chub pa as understanding or realization (rtogs pa).

sems is explained as follows:

Next, because so-called “mind” (sems) is not the mind, it is the mind essence (sems nyid). The temporary concepts of mental processing arise from conditions and perish because of conditions. Being conditioned and relative, since [the mind] cannot endure and are transformed by conditions, [mind] is not ultimate. 

The mind essence (sems nyid) has always been unconditioned. The meaning of not being destroyed by conditions and never changing in the three times is the reality that is luminous and nonconceptual.


Dorje Gyaltsen's 13th century commentary on the Cuckoo of Vidyā gives the following definitions:

The meaning: “Purity [byang]” means all phenomena that are the primal nature (rang bzhin, prakṛti) of delusion have never been established in the core of the true state, bodhicitta [byang chub sems]. Also there is no purifying antidote, its intrinsic essence beyond thought and expression is pure. 

However all the phenomena of samsara and nirvana or the universe and beings appear, they are one in bodhicitta through the principle of being free from departing and gathering, and are inseparable. Since those are free from partiality, they are comprehended (chub) to be pure. 

That “Mind of” [kyi sems] is the unmixed totally complete essence, the primal nature of the eight consciousnesses endowed with a luminous (‘od gsal) identity which inherently never wavers into any extreme at all, free from all extremes, naturally pure and unwavering in the three times. 

Now then, if it is asked “Is it not impossible for such a pure primal nature to appear to the mind of a person?” It is possible, it is called “vidyā” (rig pa). The vidyā of migrating beings itself appears as the mental consciousness in terms of apprehending subjects and apprehended objects. When vidyā manifests its own primal nature, the mental consciousness manifests as self-originated wisdom, and then the pure basis of the mental consciousness (free from the root of apprehending subject and apprehended objects) bring samsara to an end. The pristine consciousness (ye shes, jñāna) of one’s vidyā (without root or leaf) — naturally perfected as it totally encompasses and subsumes everything — is the true state [de kho na nyid, tattva].

Thus, another way to translate byang chub sems is "The mind essence of the comprehension of purity."

This also why we distinguish byang chub sems and rig pa. The former is the object of the latter.

This should clear up some questions and cause more.

For this and other reasons, Negroes, who have been shut out, or believed they had been shut out, of employment by the unions, have been in the past very willing strike-breakers. It is another illustration of the way in which prejudice works, also, that the strikers seemed to consider it a much greater crime for a Negro, who had been denied an opportunity to work at his trade, to take the place of a striking employee than it was for a white man to do the same thing. Not only have Negro strike-breakers been savagely beaten and even murdered by strikers or their sympathizers, but in some instances every Negro, no matter what his occupation, who lived in the vicinity of the strike has found himself in danger.

Another reason why Negroes are prejudiced against the unions is that, during the past few years, several attempts have been made by the members of labor unions which do not admit Negroes to membership, to secure the discharge of Negroes employed in their trades. For example, in March, 1911, the white firemen on the Queen and Crescent Railway struck as the result of a controversy over the Negro firemen employed by the road. The white firemen, according to the press reports, wanted the Negro firemen assigned to the poorest runs. Another report stated that an effort was made to compel the railway company to get rid of the Negro firemen altogether.

There is merit to a systematic project of translating the basic commentaries before the theg mchog mdzod. The TCD is invaluable for Longchenpa’s insights into the 17 tantras, but without Vimalamitra’s commentaries, much of what is alluded to in Longchenpa’s corpus remains obscure, and this is obvious in all the 7 treasures that have thus far been translated. For example, in order to elucidate points in the Tshig don mdzod, Khenpo Namdrol frequently refers to these commentaries. So as a matter of principle, i think my approach is more sound.

Especially since all the other six treasuries of Longchenpa have by and large, with the exception of the Wish-Fulfilling Treasury or Yishyin Dzod, been translated and published.

If you cut off a branch of a shrub or some other plant, the rest of the plant is still alive, in fact you can make another plant from the part you cut off.

The same is true of humans (cloning), etc. The term “continuum” is a convention for a series of moments that observe morphological regularity, that’s all. But they too have no absolute identity.

The rebirth argument is not particularly convincing. So, in the end, Buddhists who insist on plantlife insentience are really just resting their arguments on passages from texts. That’s fine, but then, how does one pick and choose? Meru is false, but plant insentience is true?

Malcolm wrote:
The ripening of karma excludes people from our traditions. One either has the gathered the roots of virtue to even hear the name "Buddha" or one has not. It is not question of fundamentalist attitudes. All sentient beings have the potential to awaken. Very few sentient beings meet the proper set of conditions, the eight freedoms and ten endowments, so that becomes a real possibility for them in this lifetime. This is the difference between natural gotra, which all sentient beings possess, and developed gotra, which exists only in those who have undertaken to follow the bodhisattva path in some lifetime or another. Since below the 7th bhumi, bodhisattvas lose their awakening entirely in every birth, it is very possible there are many beings in many dimensions who pursue this or that religious career, notable primarily for their compassion. But, in absence of the Buddhadharma, they certainly cannot directly lead people to liberation, the best they can do is encourage people to behave virtuously. The Jataka tales exemplify this.

Why bother, unless it is of interest to you. You have not really examined why epistemology was taken up in Buddhism, where it was rejected by Nāgārjuna. The answer is pretty simple: epistemology was taken up with a view to convince tīrthikas that the Buddha was omniscient with respect to liberation without recourse to any of our own scriptures. I am not sure that is a worthwhile goal to pursue with Post-Quine logic.

There really isn't anything Western philosophy can add to Buddhadharma, other than perhaps a more clearly articulated theory of social justice, ala Rawls, etc. But these are mundane considerations, as I mentioned above, more in line with what we call Nitiśastras, treatises on governance. Why would Buddhadharma need such a theory articulated? Because for most of its history, Buddhism has flourished in the context of absolute monarchies. Therefore, deeply considered ethical treatises which considered things from the point of view of multiple stakeholders other than kings and aristocrats became more important. And also, there were in India manuals on statecraft like Kautilya's Arthaśastra. Buddhism has never confronted democracy, so Buddhists are still working out how democracy and Buddhism will interact, etc. Therefore, if there is philosophical work to be done, it is in this area, but definitely not when it comes to the path or liberation.

It really depends on where your interests lie. Pramana is not liberative. It concerns discerning veridical cognitions from false cognitions, conventionally speaking. One can analyze conventional phenomena endlessly, and still never ever come close to the taste of liberation. There is no doubt that modern logic is much more sophisticated than Dharmakirti’s seven treatises. So what? We don’t need pramana to attain liberation (hence Nagarjuna’s dismissal of pramana). It’s all a question of domain: transcendent or mundane. Buddhadharma concerns the former, and to the extent it is worthwhile and beneficial, can employ the latter, for example, pramana, medicine, grammar, and so on.

But in whatsoever Dhamma and Discipline there is found the Noble Eightfold Path, there is found a true ascetic of the first, second, third, and fourth degrees of saintliness.[54] Now in this Dhamma and Discipline, Subhadda, is found the Noble Eightfold Path; and in it alone are also found true ascetics of the first, second, third, and fourth degrees of saintliness. Devoid of true ascetics are the systems of other teachers. But if, Subhadda, the bhikkhus live righteously, the world will not be destitute of arahats."

The eightfold path begins, necessarily, with right view.

And, no, there is no other means to overcome and destroy afflictions outside of Buddhadharma. It seems you could work a bit more on contemplating the eight freedoms and ten endowments that make up a precious human birth.

There is no "tantric" view of this. Some people interpret the samaya admonition not to criticize the Hinayāna as a blanket prohibition against critiquing any religion at all. Slagging off someone's religion out of spite is wrong, but offering criticisms of idiots like Hegel and so on, no problem.

Once, in 2002, I was hanging out with ChNN in his cabin at Tsegyalgar, and he pulled out this flag on the right, which Khenpo Choga had sent him:



ChNN remarked (and I paraphrase), "This "Dzogchen" flag is a modern style, politics, like the so-called Buddhist flag (on the left, created by Olcott). The real Buddhist flag is the Gyaltsen":



Disclaimer, I have no idea about Khenpo Choga's teachings.

Tibetans have done such a good job of forgetting their own indigenous, pre-Buddhist history, their indigenous civilization can only be caught in glimpses.

The Buddha himself enjoined that the Dharma be taught in the vernacular language of people interested in the Dharma: this is why we have Dharma texts in Tocharian, Sassanian, Chinese, Tibetan, Pali, Drusha, Ghandaran, etc.

It's a huge historical day in U.S. history, overturning an almost 50 year precedent in Roe v. Wade, which allowed abortion. However, it's not going to really change that much in practical terms, as all it does is give the states the power to enact their own restrictions, if they so choose. Most states will not place any restrictions. There are maybe about 10 states that might place severe restrictions or outright bans, but then all a woman has to do, it to travel to a state that allows it.

I appreciate his book. But there are some pretty large errors of misunderstanding of Dzogchen terminology, at minimum. Compare this:

Rigpa, nondual awareness, is the direct knowing of this. It’s the quality of mind that knows, while abiding nowhere.

Malcolm wrote:
With Jigme Lingpa:

Astus said:
There are three kinds of vidyā in the sutras of Mahāyāna: the knowledge (rig pa, vidyā) of the divine eye, knowledge of past lives, and immaculate knowledge, that is, knowledge is a so-called cognition. Apart from this explanation in three categories, the dharmatā of vidyā—transcending the eight consciousnesses that include thoughts, reflections, causes, and results of a final goal—exists as the gnosis (ye shes) of the natural great perfection...The essence of that view is the truth of āryas, the personally-intuited gnosis (so so rang rig pa'i ye shes, pratyatmyavedanajñāna) that is free from subject and object.

Malcolm wrote:
So here, Amaro, draws an understandable, but erroneous conclusion, assuming that rigpa/vidyā referred to in Dzogchen is the mental factor of cognizance. Elsewhere, he refers to rig pa as intrinsic awareness (rang rig), understandably ignorant of the fact that rig pa, rang rig, and so on, in Dzogchen are contractions of so so rang rig pa'i ye shes, which is a very common term in Buddhist literature. If one claims that svasamvedana is what "rang rig" refers to, one's view does not transcend Yogacāra. This is an extremely common error, with consequences for one's practice.

The difference between the nine yānas and the great perfection is that the former take mind as the basis; where as the great perfection takes gnosis as the basis. This has consequences for the path: the nine yānas are paths based on causes and results; path of Dzogchen is not based on causes and results. This also has consequences for the result. In the the nine yānas the three kāyas are a result that arise from the two accumulations; in Dzogchen, the three kāyas are path experiences and do not exist in the result.

Mel Kawachen (1126-1211) - dates safer - is the master of Künzang Dorjé in the zhi byed bar ma so lugs ( don brgyud and the disciple of Shami Mönlam Bar (1085-1171), a key master of Tenné (so Künzang Dorjé and Tenné received the same lineage)
Künzang Dorjé is possibly just a little younger than Mel and Tenné (b. 1127) but not much more

So Tenné did this remarquable clarification work, highlighting the original cycles of instructions ; otherwise, he was quite an exceptionnal character, his rang rnam is pretty atypic and comparable to some of the best French medieval literature. Freshness. Nothing of the conventions of later rnam thar.
Could you please locate Künzang Dorjé's account?, it can be interesting to compare with Gö Lotsawa's version.

Just look at how they arrange these things in a Shingon alter. No stupa, no text.

For example, ChNN specified the only thing one really needs for a shrine is a picture of A in thigle of five colors, a candle for offering, and incense for dharmapālas, and this is enough for a formal shrine. If one like to do more, of course, one can.

There is no one right way. So, it is sufficient for one's home shrine to simply have a picture of one's guru.

Well actually, the sangha is certainly an institution that the Buddha established.The rules came later, but there certainly was a going for refuge that brought people into a certain community. One of his last instructions was on what to do when people act in a manner not in harmony with the community - excommunication. [/quote]

???

No. Where did the Buddha recommend excommunication? How could a buddha, an embodiment of compassion, excommunicate anyone?
There would need to be something to be excommunicated from - and that is the fellowship of refuge.
Losing one's status as bhikṣu does not constitute loss of refuge. The Sangha is made up of four types of persons (eight when multiplied by gender). And frankly since you are not a bhikṣu, the only think you can do is complain to his Sangha. And likely, he is not even a bhikṣu. Even if he were, since there is no rule in Vinaya, as far as I know, stating that bhikṣus (if the guy is even a bhikṣu) are forbidden from attending PETA protests or glueing their hands to counters. I agree with you it is dumb, but, so what? Buddhists do all kinds of dumb shit I don't agree with. So your complaint would amount to nothing.

Beyond that, this person probably thinks they are doing a bodhisattva action. They likely have generated bodhicitta.
Of course we can choose to efface everything with "its empty, man", but I don't think it needs to be explained to you the fault in that. We sentient beings inescapably live in a matrix of conventions. We can deny them on the basis of emptiness, but for most of us that's nothing more than an intellectual position. An authentic insight into emptiness is something wholly different. We're not talking about that, so its not relevant here.
My point has to do with contrasting "Buddhists" who don't agree on much, with Buddhadharma, which does not depend on such conventions. There are people, Buddhists, who think that protesting at Starbucks over soy milk is entirely in line with Buddhism. You disagree. You want to excommunicate them, since this is accords with your idea of "Buddhism." But in the end, it is just a bunch of accepting and rejecting.
We go for refuge in certain conventions as an antidote to the suffering due to our entanglement in conventions. In the end, we are still left with the triratna and our responsibility to keep it alive for the future.
We cannot keep the Buddha alive, he went into parinirvana 2500 years ago. The relative renunciate Sangha is in a rapid state of decline, merely a reflection of what it once was—people try to preserve it, but the Buddha predicted it would perish. The Dharma is there to be realized even when there is no Buddha present in the world, such as now. So, the only way to keep the Three Jewels alive is in our own practice, and not by looking at the faults we perceive in other's "Buddhism."

When two children have the same father, we consider them to be in the same family. No?

Even Thukje Tsondru received most of his education at Sakya affiliated monasteries at the height the Sakya Hegemony.

It's fine for the Jonangpas to consider themselves an independent lineage, but the fact is that they remained closely connected with the Sakya school for much of their existence. For example, Dakchen Dorjechang realized mahamudra by practicing the six limb yoga, but no one would call him a Jonangpa. The longest, most detailed commentary on Kalacakra was written by Lama Dampa Sonam Gyaltsen who received the Jonang tradition. He wrote more on Kalacakra that any other single subject, but no one could consider him a Jonangpa.

In those days, there were a number of smaller institutions that flourished, like Zhalu, Jonang, and so on. We can say that they are this or that instution, but when we examine things more clearly, their institutional identity as independent lineages is a function of the rising power of the Gelugpas more than anything else. They were either absorbed, like Nalendra, made a deal, like Sakya, Drikung, and so on, or were suppressed like Karma Kagyu and Jonang.

And there is inconvenient presence of syllable འ, which has no correlate in Sanskrit, as I mentioned above. If anything, Oddiyana language would have been a Central Asian language at the border of Iranian and Indian language spheres. Several Dzogchen tantras and texts claim they are translated from multiple languages. How much credibility we can lend such assertions is a debate for text critical scholars. Other than texts like song of the vajra, we have almost no evidence of Oddiyana language, other than mentions of it as a language distinct from Sanskrit.

And no, there is no one alive who can offer much more than Longchenpa did. Having translated major portions of Dzogchen linguistic theory, it has no relationship to Pannini’s grammar. It’s quite unique.

Finally, it’s entirely certain that “Indic” title of the Kun byed rgyal po is fairly modern, since the KG bears considerable evidence of being a Tibetan compilation of earlier sources, and there is no mention of it before the 11th century, though it’s five core chapters are cited by Nubcheb, but it never is.

The status of Jonang as divorced from Sakya is a post-Taranatha situation. Prior to Gorampa, gzhan stong was quite popular in Sakya.

In this way, it is hard to describe either the practice or the theory of the Jonang as anything except independent and original.

Thanks for weighing in here. Whereas it is true that Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen came from Sakya (wasn't he Abbott?), And when he went to the Jomanang valley, the Jonang Lineage had already existed I believe. So the lineage was not created by Dolpopa.

In fact, some of the main figures of the Sakya lineage at that time were at odds with Dolpopa including Butön Rinchen Drup. So at the very least the thought of being a Sakya sub-school probably ended at that point.

Simple answer, the title is not Sanskrit.

Shabda said:
Although reductionist explanations can be useful at times, I fear in truth, with due respect, it's not that simple, nor is that an accurate statement.  In fact, the title as reported by Tarthang Tulku in his edition of the Derge Catalog (Dharma, 1980) reads:

Sarvadharmamahāśāntibodhicittakularāja

Which is, contrary to some claims, a Sanskrit title,  the exact same language as every other Indian title of all texts of the Derge (and similar) Tibetan canon(s), including those of the Ancient Tantra section.  If that title is not Sanskrit, then you'll agree there is no such thing as a Sanskrit title anywhere!  So it's intersting that Tarthang Tulku chose to  report the title with that exact spelling, which reads "The King of the Family of Bodhicitta that is the Great Peace or Pacification of All Phenomena".

So the question remains, is the word "kulaya" extrapolated from "kula" in the same way as "kilaya" was from "kila"?  Did Tarthang Tulku restore it to its original form?  And, why did the Tibetan translation (kunbyed) differ so much from the Indian for that term (kulaya),the two having nothing in common at all?

Malcolm wrote:
The title is a backtranslation. If you compare the titles in various versions of rnying ma rgyud “bum, you find wide discrepancies. The Derge version has replaced many of the earlier “Indic” titles found in the Tshams brag  reskin with back translations. The problem is that the often unintelligible Indic language version found in the latter collection is the one commented upon syllable by syllable. So, you really cannot trust the “Sanskrit” of these titles when examining them from the Derge version of the Nyingma canon.

In any case, Dzogchen tantras are held to been given in Oddiyana language, not Sanskrit. As Longchenpa points out, the འ syllable does not exist in Sanskrit, but according to him, does exist in the language of Oddiyana.

Dear Sirs

The word "kulaya" in the Indian title of the Kunbyed rGyalpo Sutra/Tantra is very mysterious it seems to me.  It isn't a real Sanskrit word nor it appears is it a word from any other language.  There is the Sanskrit word "kulāya" which mainly means "nest", but that doesn't seem to fit the context.  Besides, they are different words with different spellings.  The Tibetan translation offers no clues since "kulaya" is translated "kunbyed" or "all-creating" which is nothing related to "kulaya" but would instead in Sanskrit be "sarvakrti" or "sarvakara" or something like that.  Could it be that the underlying word is actually "kula", "[Buddha]-family", and that it has been extrapolated in "kulaya" in the same way that "kīla" becomes "kīlaya" for no obvious reason?  Kula/kulaya....kīla/kīlaya.  This way, the Indian/Sanskrit name of the deity would be:

bodhicittakularāja

rather than:

bodhicittakulayarāja

This way, the name could be understoof to mean "the King of the Family of Bodhicitta" which would be another way of saying the king of the 5 Buddha families or kulas; since the Bodhicittavajra family is sometimes called the 6th Buddha family that rules the main 5 ones.

I have been reading old threads in the forum and I noticed that there were instances of certain deities being said to be "not a path", which I'm assuming means not a complete path to liberation. One such mentioned is Mahāmāyūrī because her practice is for temporary benefits.

The HYT practices are a given, such as Chakrasamvara, Hevajra, etc., and I'm more interested in deities that one might consider "of the lower tantras" instead.

In line with that, how do we determine if the practice of a deity is a [complete] path? What of Mārīcī or Vasudhārā, for example, both of whom, at least on the surface, practiced for temporary benefits as well?

Thank you in advance.

Mañjuśrī, Avalokitśvara, Vajrapaṇī all have complete paths.

Complete paths in Vajrayāna really begin with Carya Tantra.

We therefore can't condone or cover up any sexual misbehaviour which falls too far outside community expectations, even if it falls within the norms of our religious tradition.
We could, in fact, see the string of abuse scandals as a long-running series of skirmishes or negotiations between the two sets of standards.
And it seems to me that discussions like this one could help us work out where the borders of acceptable behaviours, and acceptable responses to unacceptable behaviours, might lie.

Malcolm wrote:
I already pointed out a number of red flags for whether a teacher was behaving inappropriately. Unfortunately, the assumption is that this is all one way, and it isn't. Patrons, who by all measure are students, for example, exert enormous influence in Tibetan Buddhist centers, and elsewhere. The possibility for misconduct among them is enormous, including making advances on men and women in centers, financial leverage, and so on.

These discussions are endless because they are not evidence-based. They are values-based, and therefore political issues, rather than ethical issues, 90% of the time.

For example, for years the faculty at Smith College was not to have any kind of relationship with anyone in the student body. The student body objected, feeling infantilized, and the policy was revised so that one was only forbidden to have a relationship with a student currently studying in one's course.

Pedophilia is so far outside of this discussion as to be absurd. The Buddha himself prohibited it, though at the time, the definition of "child" was considerably more limited. But even 150 years ago in our own culture, 13 year old minors were basically adults, now children by all definitions. Our concept of minors as "children" dates from the early 20th century, with adoption of child labor laws.

In the United States, there is no consistent law about ordained ministers pursuing romantic partners among their constituents. In some states there is no law about it, in some states it is illegal. But the key word here is "ordained." To be ordained means to be recognized by a professional body. But separation of church and state in this country, the USA, precludes forcing any religion to only have "professional" ministers. One cannot force a Dharma center's teacher or an itinerant teacher to be "qualified." All the state can do is refuse to give such people license to officiate at weddings and funerals, which are recognized civil procedures.

Therefore, Dharma centers are on their own in this regard, and can only agree to codes of ethics that, frankly, are barely enforceable. We see examples of people violating these codes, moving on, and then doing it again elsewhere. This indicates to me that the problem is not power differentials, but womanizing. And if one is to argue that womanizing is only possible because of some imputed power differential in a dharma center, I have news for you. Unless that dharma organization is set up as an educational institution, and therefore subject to civil codes, it has nothing that can be withheld from a student. No degree, no honors, etc. A power differential is predicated on a carrot and a stick. The carrot is a reward such as raise, promotion, grade and and so on. The stick is the sexual favor.

Now, I can certainly imagine some young, naive person imagining that their liberation (the carrot) might depend on granting some sexual favor (the stick) to the lama, which is why I identify relationships with new students as a possible issue. But really, people need to grow up. Liberation, in Buddhism, never comes from someone else. It cannot be given to you even by the Buddha. The worse someone can do is say,  "If you won't screw me, I won't teach you." I imagine that this could be devastating to someone, but most of the women I know who were propositioned by lamas when they were new in the Dharma were grossed out.

Actually, the worst offenders in the Dharma scene are not teachers, but rather Senior Students, who trade on their affiliation with Lama so and so, etc., and their position in a given Dharma center (chant leader, etc.) etc., proposition new women who show up. But no one ever discusses this at all, crickets.

Anyway, more fuel on the fire.

Some, but not all. Many are informal gatherings, not nonprofits, not registered churches, etc.

Codes of ethics are often false blankets, but in the woke world, they are clung to like clumps of grass on a river bank. The Buddha's own recommendations for sexual misconduct with respect to partners is sufficient in most cases: don't sleep with minors, don't sleep with other people's spouses, etc.

For example, I met a Bhutanese man once, who could not understand why he could not have two female partners at the same time in the USA. Why? His father had two wives and he had two moms.

In the end, people just need to be adults, and take responsibility for their own choices. That is the best solution. If someone sleeps with Lama so and so and finds out that it is not working out, then move on. Your spiritual life does not depend on someone else, it depends on you.

Tibetan Buddhist teachers are not therapists, counsellors, social workers, doctors, etc. They principally act as instructors in liturgy and Buddhist praxis in various lineages.

Most people will never have an opportunity to spend any facetime with their guru, from whom they receive empowerments and so on. They will mostly interact with center heads and senior students. How such places work things out with respect to this issue is up to them.

The sex part is not appropriate in the opinion of many Buddhist groups, in part because it violates that trust.

Malcolm wrote:
Sex is messy, and many people are not mature about it, both teachers and students.

As for your claim is violates "trust," this is again not a quantifiable absolute. In Tibetan Buddhism, sexual pleasure is not something to be avoided. Many people, women as well as men, are attracted to Tibetan Buddhism precisely because this is so. Tangentially are many women attending so-called "tantric retreats" because they have romantic ideas about sacred sexuality and so on. Many of them wind up sleeping with the so-called instructors, and quite intentionally.

However, in Tibetan Buddhism, while sexual pleasure is not something to avoid, so-called sexual yogas are not fun, they are laborious, systematic, time-consuming, and frankly, not very erotic. In any case, they are only for young people between 16-26. So, its a bunch of baloney that this violates "trust." It might very well do so in Vipassana and Zen, etc. Tibetan Buddhism is a different animal. If you had not noticed, this is where this OP is found.

The real issue in Buddhism is that many people think somehow their teacher is enlightened, when this is obviously not the case 99 percent of the time in every school. The real problem is Buddhist puffery about "enlightened masters" and naive romantics who believe in such things.

If a Buddhist teacher wants to have a romantic relationship with a student, this axiomatic proof that person is very unlikely to be a liberated person, no matter how eloquent they may sound or how still or long they may be able to sit.

The real problem is the naivety that people carry when they begin to study and practice. All the problematic situations I have seen is where the teacher allows students to think they are enlightened. If there is a problem, it is Buddhist marketing that preys on the naive. The problem is not sex. The problem is expectations. If someone pretends to be enlightened and then goes out and seduces a student based on that premise, this is abusive. But if two people happen to fall in love, one a teacher and the other a student, or even if they just want to use each other for sex (mutually), I have zero problem with this and I think everyone should mind their own business. Of course, if they are a monastic, they should know better, period.

Frankly, I think the way some buddhists react to this phenomena of teachers having romantic relations with students as if it is always bad is as immature as it is infantilizing. People really need to grow up and take responsibility for their own actions.

Of course there is no harm talking these things through.

What would signs of abuse of a sangha look like? The teacher has serial or multiple relationships with students. The teacher claims spiritual benefit for the student in such a relationship. The student is required to keep the relationship secret under threat of "samaya." There is a significant age disparity between the two parties (25/60, for example). The student is very new, young, and inexperienced. In these circumstances, of course, the teacher needs to be confronted, the sangha broken up, and so on. I also want to add that such abuse generally involves financial impropriety as well.

Americans in general are very hysterical about such things. I find Europeans to be a bit more level-headed with regard to such issues.

People on the other hand experience some discomfort with the fact that I am not axiomatically opposed to romantic relationships between teachers and students. It is quite common in Tibetan Buddhism. Most Tibetan lamas, for example, with western wives have married one of their students. Most Tibetan wives of Tibetan lamas are absolutely their students. It’s just not as cut and dried as some western Buddhists would like it to be.

“Predatory” male Buddhist teachers are no different than any other womanizer. We don’t say that all women who get involved with womanizers are suffering from a power differential. Women make bad choices sometimes, and sometimes those bad choices happen to be Buddhist men. The opposite is also true. I’ve known some “predatory” female Buddhist teachers.

anjali said:
Here is an engaging and informative philosophical talk by Swami Sarvapriyananda, a scholar monk in the Ramakrisha lineage on an exposition of Buddhist emptiness, with an Advaita response: Vedantic Self and Buddhist Non-Self

Normally, I wouldn't post something like this on DW, but I think the Swami does a good job of presenting almost 2,000 years of Buddhist thought on emptiness from the Buddha, through Nagarjuna, Chandrakirti, and on into Tibetan Buddhism with mentions of Prasangika Madhyamika and Shentong. The majority of the talk discusses Chandrakirti's Sevenfold Reasoning of the Chariot. Near the end of the talk, he covers the fivefold emptiness as discussed in Khenpo Tsultrim Gyamtso Rinpoche's Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness. Although he doesn't mention Khenpo by name, he mentions the book and covers each of the five emptinesses.

Most of the talk is a fair exegesis of Buddhist thought. The Advaita response actually only covers about 20 minutes of the talk at the end. Swami Sarvapriyananda took a class on Tibetan Buddhism under Jay Garfield at Harvard Divinity School a couple of years ago. This talk seems to be based primarily on a paper he wrote for that class.

The occasion of the talk was Vesak.

Personally, I'm not interested in discussing/debating this topic. I'm merely offering this talk to those who are interested in such things.

A secret sexual relationship involving a power differential such as that between a student and teacher obviously violates trust, doesn't it? Is "consort" what the victim calls herself? A teacher resignation (or expulsion) would be "leaving everyone else without their teacher"? Aw, poor you.


Malcolm wrote:
Lot of assumptions here. Who said it was secret? Are teachers obligated to check with all their students before they have sex with one of them? Is it anyone's business who one sleeps with? No. She had regrets. So what? Is there a claim of harm or merely regret?

And, in Vajrayāna, assuming the person received empowerment from this teacher, it is a little hard to expel one with whom one has samaya. Sleeping with students may not be a good idea, but there are a whole host of issues here which are not going to be resolved through simplistic, judgmental comments.

We can understand this by thinking about the Prasangika's presentation of "same entity different isolates." In the case of emptiness, all phenomena have the same nature or entity but have different conventional bases or imputation or “isolates." Therefore they have the same entity emptiness-but different isolates their bases of their bases of designation.


heart said:
Entity = "a thing with distinct and independent existence". So using "entity" for "nature" as he does in your quote is just plain wrong.

SO - from what I know (and this is particularly where I'm hoping for more knowledgeable input), it seems that the following, necessarily vague, equivalences might make sense:
kyorpon: beyond secondary education, perhaps equivalent to some sort of tertiary diploma focussed on relevant textual knowledge and expertise
khenpo: Master (whether of Arts or Studies is not important), being higher than a normal first-degree Batchelor's.

But I could be wrong...

The first problem is that the equivalent for kyorpon would be TA, teaching assistant, it’s an appointment, not a degree. So grad student.

The degrees are bka’ bzhi pa ( four treatises), bka’ bcu pa (ten texts), and mkhan po. Slob dpon is not a degree, but a title, usually for nonmonastics with an advanced education. Technically, a Khenpo can lead an ordination of monks and nuns.

If you were working age, they basically made it necessary to get vaccinated if you wanted to leave your home. But nobody tells their Chinese grandmother what to do.

Not quite.  The government decided it couldn’t/wouldn’t/whatever require the elderly to vaccinate in the same way it required the working age people.  So now it is stuck with a large unvaccinated elderly population.  Etc etc.

If they were not in the middle of an outbreak they would have more options available.  As it is they had authorized use of paxlovid and molnupravir at the end of 2021. But once you’re actually engaged in trying to suppress an outbreak, your options are limited.  It’s hard to run a second mass vaccination campaign while you’re trying to suppress an outbreak - you have to either let the suppression go and deal with a few million deaths, or continue the suppression until cases come down. Neither are great options.

Then as I mentioned a post or so back, perhaps it is better to not take the Gunas into so much consideration, and instead go by the Three Humours (Vata/Lung, Pitta/Tripa, Kapha/Badkan). Now the Three Humours don’t seem to be exactly parallel to the Three Gunas, although maybe there’s some overlap; at least with pitta/tripa & rajas and the fire or heat element (?) In other words maybe I’ll want to look into adding more pitta or tripa foods, instead of trying to look up what foods are rajasic….

And I wouldn’t say that I eat rotten, stale, reheated, or (overly) processed foods (all tamasic); yet I’m all about fermented foods with bacteria, which if the latter are considered tamasic, would still be worth the trade-off due to the nutritional content.

Also if pasture-raised egg yolks are tamasic, they’re still also packed with naturally occurring vitamins like Vitamin K2 and just about every other essential vitamin you can think of….

But just because we can speculate that a means might exist to do this - eg using exotic matter to stabilize and expand a wormhole occurring naturally on the event horizon of a supermassive object - the far, far more likely outcome is that this simply isn’t possible.

All classical Madhyamaka scholars in Tibet accept emptiness as a non-affirming negation.
What I mean is the distinction that Duckworth is setting up above: "For these thinkers, emptiness is not the negation of a putative object of negation, for emptiness is beyond any description and hence transcends both affirmation and negation."

Malcolm wrote:
All Classical Madhyamakas agree that emptiness is the emptiness of something, and that without something, there cannot be nothing. What is that something? Dependent Origination. No classical Madhyamaka accepts a self-established ineffable emptiness. The ultimate is the ultimate of something, no classical Madhyamaka rejects this, including Mipham. Otherwise one cannot have the Union of the two truths and so on which became codified with the translation of the MAV of Candrakirti.

Malcolm wrote:
Abhisheka is a very precise term for a specific rite. It was the incorrect use of that word that prompted my initial comment. There are many kinds of transmission in Buddhadharma. But these two gentlemen regularly speak of such things in a very haphazard, irresponsible manner that is misleading.

When speaking of how Dzogchen is transmitted, for example, as in sutra, the kind of transmission depends on the capacity of the practitioner. These issues are detailed precisely in various authoritative commentaries. It’s true that Dzogchen transmission does not need to be wrapped up in a complicated mandala ritual,  but it still has identifiable principles of transmission that have written about extensively, the most important of which are the teacher’s intent and the student’s receptivity. The teacher  must be able to and intend to give transmission and the student has to be receptive and proactive in receiving transmissions. The details depend on  a variety of factors. For example Manjushrimitra was a highly trained pandita as well as a Vajrayana practitioner already when he met Garab Dorje. Garab Dorje was a Indian child prodigy, a nirmanakaya.

Especially when discussing the other Vajrayana systems, a formal set of ritual empowerments is essential. There are many reasons for this, not least of which is the assertion that the result, buddhahood depends on gathering the two accumulations.

On the fun side, some prominent Tibetan noble families like the Khon have their own famous creation myth that their ancestors were descended from beings of light from a second dhyana plane of existence called Heavenly Clear Light.

Influences from agganna or similar theme found in the sutras? Well, its up to one to decide for themselves.

Malcolm wrote:
'Od gsal lha are pre-buddhist. They cannot be Ābhāsvara devas since they belong to the desire realm. Indeed, the Khon clan identify a very specific mountain peak to the north of the Tsangpo river  as the site where the sky gods (gram aha) as they are also called descended in Tibet. The middle brother was called gYu ring, or Long Turquoise. His sons were the famous seven Ma sang brothers, which include the dharmapāla Vajrasadhu. The Ma sang are also credited with inventing divination and gambling with dice. The ancient Tibetan game of Pagchen is credited to them as well. In any case, it is impossible for form realm gods to descend to the desire realm, much less the human realm, and even if they were to do so, humans could not interact with them. There is a similar myth from the lCe clan, only in this case, the 'od gsal lha descend in Tajik, and conquered the humans there, before moving into Mang yul, Tibet via Zhang Zhung.

Thus, these so-called gods from which these Tibetan clans claim descent are pre-buddhist classes of deities, and have nothing to with Indian cosmology at all.

[ 5 ] The Supreme Court has held, for example, that public school officials violated the Establishment Clause by inviting a rabbi to deliver a prayer at a graduation ceremony because such conduct was "attributable to the State" and applied "subtle coercive pressures," "where the student had no real alternative which would have allowed her to avoid the fact or appearance of participation."

Support for Democratic Senate candidates has actually increased since UMass Polls conducted in April 2021 (+2) and December 2021 (+4), while support for Republican Senate candidates in the new poll is five points lower than both of last year’s UMass Polls. About one in five respondents indicated that they don’t know which party’s candidate they would vote for in either their House (19%) or Senate (21%) races.

“If the past is any indication, then President Biden and the Democratic Party will likely lose seats in the U.S. Congress if not total control of both the House and the Senate,” says Nteta. “However, our results suggest that all is not lost, with Democratic candidates in both the House and Senate holding on to slim leads over their Republican opponents. With six months until Election Day, it looks like the fight for control of Congress may not comport with our historical expectations.”

This poll reflects my gut instinct. And if the Dems hold the house and the senate, then Biden will win in 2024, no ifs, ands or buts.

Russia is a perfect example of the wet dream the libertarian side of the GOP has been advocating for the last century. What they fail to understand is that Autocracy is the certain outcome of poorly regulated markets. The US has fallen into the same trap.

I would say that Putin lost the initiative after he lost the Battle of Kyiv. It is he who is on his back foot now.

For example, the Ukrainians have a new and very novel software package which runs their artillery. In the US Army, call to strike is generally 1 hour, and never gets better than 15 minutes. What is the main delay? JAG officers, apparently, who have to sign off on that that strike is a legitimate military target. The Ukrainians have a five minute window from call to strike. Also, their artillery strikes are designed to confuse Russian counter-artillery radar. Now they are also being gifted with advanced counter artillery radar from the US, etc. At the present moment, the conflict in Donbas, etc., is mainly an artillery war, and the Russians are wasting huge amounts of ammunition on empty farmland. The Ukrainians on the other hand are able to accurately target tanks, etc., with artillery directly. This is unheard of before this war. UAV's have really changed the nature of air war permanently. All bets are on Ukraine pushing Russian troops out of all occupied territory with NATO backing.

Russia is toast. They will be Germany after WWI, since not many people are going to be willing to help them rebuild after this war. Also, it is quite likely that the RF will split up as a result of all of this. Who wants to be part of a country lead by crazy, old white people? (Oh wait, I live in the US... ). Anyway, back to the main point: ethnic division in the RF is going to be exacerbated by this conflict. The RF, IMO, is only held together at this point by inertia and nostalgia.

Cetana (volition/intention) is a caitta (mental factor). It accompanies every citta, being neutral in character.

So it still applies that --> affliction --> karma --> suffering -->, since afflicted positive actions only lead to birth in higher realms, and not to liberation.

For example, when one perceives an enemy, the caitta of anger is produced, this colors cetana negatively, and one then engages in verbal and physical actions which aim to harm that enemy. Cetana is simply that mental factor that puts the mind's negative and positive qualities into action. That's is why the Buddha defined cetana, intention, as karma, action, in the Anguttara NIkaya, iii.415:

"Mental volition, O Bhikkhus, is what I call action (Kamma). Having volition, one acts by body, speech and thought."

The old question about merit is: Does it matter if the recipient of one's generosity does not actually get one's gift? Due to some circumstance that is, or seems to be, beyond one's control. Like for example a sudden earthquake or a traffic accident, that destroys the actual gift or its giving. I.e. is the intention really enough to create the positive karmic consequence or not ?

Etienne Lamotte has in his History of Indian Buddhism answered this question: According to tradition the merit of a gift is twofold, 1. there is the actual intention, the disposition it creates in one's mental continuum, and its future karmic reward. And 2. there is the aspect of the enjoyment of the gift by its recipient. This event creates happiness also in the giver.  If the gift is not received nor enjoyed this happines is not created. Thus it does matter whether the gift is  received or not.

All positive, negative, and neutral intentions (karmas) are caused by positive minds, affliced minds, and neutral minds. This is why it is important to understand operation of mental factors.

For example, for neutral karmas, I see food, then I decide to eat it. For negative karmas, I see an object I dislike, which arouses my affliction of hatred, then I try to eliminate it. I see something I desire, then I decide to steal it.

Well most of the fruits and vegetables we now eat didn’t exist until recent centuries. Just about any of them you can find at a grocery store are grafted, selectively bred, hybridized etc. Almost every contemporary common vegetable (broccoli, cabbage, etc.) was bred from a simple mustard green or something like that.

https://i.insider.com/5638f775dd08957b7 ... &auto=webp

You won’t find broccoli just growing in the wild, and most natural fruits in the wild are mostly tough rind and seeds with very little edible fleshy parts.

And with how much fruit and vegetable matter you have to consume to get all your nutrients, you’d be very hard-pressed to live on berries, the few edible roots you could find, and like maybe wild nettles, mustard greens, and dandelions. Of course some regions are more plentiful than others, but most environments aren’t so much.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct, most crops eaten today were developed by humans in the last 10,000 years. Prior to that there was little or no cultivation, just gathering berries, tubers, etc. The notion of rich natural orchards of fruit and natural grain where humans just ate of them free of competition is a fantasy. .

This is kind of diet is more consistent with what ancient humans in temperate zones likely ate:

Norwegian mentioned political philosophy, but in the context of the Buddha's teachings, the word "sabba" is known through negation. The three marks of existence are preceded by sabba, which shows an inherent limitation in worldly ways. This limitation expresses itself in what Malcolm shared, the urge to convert, even if violence is what it takes. This very urge translates into encouraging others to act against their own interest as long as they pretend to follow ones own ideology and become a member of the group. Within this mindset, encouraging Ukraine to challenge Russia is not a bad advise, even if this causes destruction and unnecessary suffering. This usually comes along with promises of better future, to rationalize short term self-inflicted misery.

The problem at home are the MARs, identified in the 1980's by a far-right conservative, Samuel Todd Francis:

Queequeg said:
How could a political movement rise up to challenge ruling elites? Francis believed it required capturing the anger and resentment of a class of Americans whose interests the managerial revolution had not benefited. He called them “Middle American Radicals” and suggested they would soon form a revolutionary class...MARs were neither a distinct economic class nor a political movement committed to abstract principles. He claimed that MARs were united by a common “attitude” or “temperament” about their place in American society. Their grasp of American political history, to say nothing of their knowledge of Western culture, reflected the appalling state of general literacy. Francis frequently referred to them as a cultural “proletariat,” and noted that many rely on government help in the form of benefits or loans.  As Francis began to imagine a movement built around MAR interests, he cautioned that it might appear ideologically eclectic or even incoherent. MARs tend not to think about politics primarily in terms of the size of government, and they defend neither the minimal state nor the welfare state as a matter of strict principle. What made them “radical,” Francis maintained, was their instinctive defense of communal roots and their visceral opposition to cosmopolitan values. MARs are motivated by a particular view of political life, if not a systematic ideology. Francis called it a “domestic ethic,” and claimed it as the basis of a viable future conservatism.17 It reflects a traditional impulse, suppressed by liberal individualism, that sees political life in terms of interlocking loyalties that link the family to the nation. It assesses policies not by an impersonal standard of justice, but by whether they protect and enhance group well-being. Francis believed he had found his vanguard, who lacked only an awareness of its shared interests. It was a social movement, about to be born, that would unapologetically place citizens over foreigners; majorities over minorities; the native-born over recent immigrants; the ordinary over the transgressive; and fidelity to a homeland over cosmopolitan ideals.

Because Trump weakened this order, this conflict has become existential due to Biden's rebuilding the liberal consensus, and China and Russia view the liberal international order as a threat. Why? Because liberal democracy must promote other liberal democracies for mutual security. The more of us, the better.

Queequeg said:
Liberal internationalism has moralist tendencies and activist impulses, but it is ultimately a reform-oriented and pragmatic endeavor. Modern liberals do not embrace democratic governments, market-based economic systems, and international institutions out of idealism or as tools of empire but as arrangements better suited to realizing human interests than the alternatives. Liberal internationalists hold that world politics requires institutional cooperation and political integration in response to relentlessly rising economic and security interdependence...Liberal democracies are understood to have distinctive goals for international order as well as distinctive capacities to cooperate with other liberal states. Interdependence, a fundamental condition of modern society, calls forth liberal internationalist agendas for cooperation and prompts nations to create international institutions as tools for managing and reconciling sovereignty and interdependence. Liberal democracies cannot be secure or prosperous alone; they must create a larger world so as to survive and advance.
