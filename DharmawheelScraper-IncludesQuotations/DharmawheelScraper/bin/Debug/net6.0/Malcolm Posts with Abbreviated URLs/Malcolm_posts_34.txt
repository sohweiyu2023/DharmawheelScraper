Bishamon's (Vaisravana) rank as the most powerful of the four kings is also likely due to his role as king of the north. Says independent scholar Michael D. Gunther: "In Chinese cosmology, still familiar today as 'feng shui 風水,' north is the most dangerous direction, such that dwellings (including the palaces of the Tang and Heian emperors) are built facing in the opposite direction (south). It follows that the Guardian of the North must be the leader of the other directional guardians, and that he must carry the most powerful amulets -- namely, the relics of Buddha's own body -- in order to defend against the malign northern influences. In a practical sense, the north was considered the 'bad' direction for at least two reasons: agriculturally (in the northern hemisphere), the sun is in the south, and therefore a southern exposure is most desirable, and a northern exposure is least desirable (all gardners and farmers know this, even today); and in terms of geopolitics, the Mongol peoples of the north, against whom the Great Wall was built, presented the greatest danger to China throughout much of its history.

But this has nothing to do with the Indian legends surrounding Vaiśravana, where the south is regarded as the pernicious direction, associated with Yamarāja.

Vaiśravana is associated with horses and horsemen in Uttarakuru, the northern continent, as well as Guhyakas, a kind of yakṣa who love treasures and secrets.

Hunting is legal and regulated like most jurisdictions. This is anecdotal, but it seems other than Don Jr. with his too-big-for-his-mouth incisors and make-believe safaris to shoot exotic animals inside closed pens, hunting is not all that popular around here anymore. If you were to ask most people, they'd probably more or less tell you that killing things is just not that fun.

In short, the appearances arising out of the mind's creative nature were not recognized as self-displays and so 'self and other' and the afflictions were set in motion driving the manifestation of the lokas. The purity was blinded /obscured by it's own creative potentiality just as we are 'blinded' by the mind's diverse creativity when dreaming when we don't recognize them as the mind's display. The purity never became impure but just obscured it's self from being known and experienced as pure and free of suffering.

Thank you for your response Malcolm. Does the spontaneous compassion of the basis produce action in the same way that mind produces action? Is the difference simply that cetana-motivated action produces karma while the spontaneous expression of rigpa in behavior does not? It seems like cetana is almost like a "middle man" in the compassion > volition > action chain. Is rigpa more like compassion > action? I think I'm trying to wrap my head around how the continuity of one's character traits and behaviors is maintained following a direct encounter with one's own nature. Why don't those with direct knowledge of rigpa engage in precisely the same actions when dwelling in their own state? I've seen on this forum where you've posted that minds are individual yet possessing the same qualities. This makes sense to me. In the state of rigpa, are we all simply acting precisely the way Samantabhadra would act in the presence of someone without knowledge of their own state?

Malcolm wrote:
When one has direct knowledge of one's own state, and sees that it is the solution to the existential problem for suffering, one automatically feels compassion for those that do not have this knowledge. It is just like someone who has fire seeing how the lives of those who do not know how to make fire will be immeasurably improved if they learned how to make fire.

The compassion of the basis however, is something else entirely. It is related to the nirmanakāya. Samantabhadra does not have a mind, per se. The activity of the buddhas is beyond thought, karma, etc. It is like the action of a wishfulfilling gem.

BTW, the Chinese also invented the gun, not just gunpowder. What stopped Chinese colonialism was its abandonment of its fleet, scuttled completely by 1525.

Grigoris said:
Few people in the West realise how economically and technologically advanced China was by the 1400s. The Treasure Fleet was vast -- some vessels were up to 120 metres long. (Christopher Columbus's Santa Maria was only 19 metres.) A Chinese ship might have several decks inside it, up to nine masts, twelve sails, and contain luxurious staterooms and balconies, with a crew of up to 1,500, according to one description. On one journey, 317 of these ships set sail at once.

Under the command of the eunuch admiral Zheng He, the Chinese were routinely sailing to Africa and back decades before Columbus was even born. Yet they did not go on to conquer the world. Instead, the Chinese decided to destroy their boats and stop sailing West.

In the 1470s the government destroyed Zheng's records so that his expeditions could not be repeated. And by 1525 all the ships in the Treasure Fleet were gone.

Why?

Historians have a variety of explanations. The Yongle Emperor was distracted by a land war against the Mongols, a conflict in which the navy was irrelevant, for instance. Others argue that the vast cost of the Treasure Fleet's expeditions far outweighed the actual treasure they came back with.

But Angus Deaton, the Nobel Prize-winning Princeton economist, prefers a different theory. In his book "The Great Escape: Health, Wealth, and the Origins of Inequality," he argues that the Chinese burned their boats (almost literally) in an attempt to control foreign trade.

The Treasure Fleet was abandoned at the urging of the political elite inside the Emperor's civil service who had become alarmed at the rise of a newly rich merchant class. "The emperors of China, worried about threats to their power from merchants, banned oceangoing voyages in 1430, so that Admiral Zheng He's explorations were an end, not a beginning," Deaton writes.

The practice of using a flat stick to strike the shoulders of a person meditating is not to harm them, but rather, to stimulate their alertness and remedy their posture. Thus, it is not harmful.

There was something featureless yet complete, born before heaven and earth; Silent—amorphous—it stood alone and unchanging. We may regard it as the mother of heaven and earth. Not knowing its name, I style it the "Way."[2]

The Way gave birth to unity, Unity gave birth to duality, Duality gave birth to trinity, Trinity gave birth to the myriad creatures. The myriad creatures bear yin on their back and embrace yang in their bosoms. They neutralize these vapors and thereby achieve harmony.[3]

This is no different than prakriti. Notably, in Samkhya it is the three gunas that are responsible for the evolution of the 24 tattvas.

Therefore, I would not dream of criticizing them for accepting Mt.Meru or Giant Buddhas.

Marx might have recommended revolutions in 1850. By 1871, he advised the Paris Commune not to do it and try to build a Republic together with everyone else.

Revolutions ultimately are not the main point of communism, it's fundamentally about material relations, economics. Unfortunately, most people just care about the politics and ignore the economics -- present day Marxists even take neoliberal theories of value rather than the labour theory of value. They don't realise that is the entire basis of Marxism -- production of goods based on profit results in more and more machinery, technology (constant capital), which reduces the need for human labour (variable capital) until labour is minimal/zero.

Now, whether this is true or not is a different matter, but really, it is not very different from what J S Mill said, and the dreams of a lot of techno-utopians. Techno-utopians are already kind of implementing "lite" communism with stuff like the sharing economy, open source software etc. With open source software, one programmer can write a piece of code that thousands after him can build on and use for free, that's pretty much constant capital.

I don't think utilitarian/marginal economics has much to counter this. They merely conflate value and price. I find the liberal idea that profits are the "wages of abstinence" milquetoast and retarded. The wages of abstinence are the wages of the ascetic, not of the capitalist. There certainly is a risk component to it, but then there are plenty of risk-taking entrepreneurs who end up with nothing.

I think the biggest criticism of communism (and really, most other forms of political economy which emerged in the industrial age) is not considering the inputs of nature, and only looking at mankind's internal relations.

For example, w.r.t to the labour theory of value, Ricardo discovered this major oversight near the end of his life. He carried out a correspondence with Malthus in which Malthus challenged him on stuff like whether 50 oak trees costing 20 GBP each contained as much labour as a 1000 GBP block of stone. He tried to address some of the issues in the third edition of his Principles, but couldn't fully resolve them. He went on a different thread, talking about the "labour profile" of production, which I think his later successors (including the Ricardian Socialists, which Marx certainly learned from, and J S Mill) took up, but I think (my own opinion) all of them pretty much ignored nature's inputs in value.

From a realistic Buddhist point of view, any socialist utopian vision is basically a fantasy, including the Kingdom of Shambhala, etc., and nothing is more hierarchical than a kingdom. Even Dzogchen Community, which is supposed to be nonhierarchical is anything but.

This, though, is really close to the technical definition of "heresy" in Christianity. A heretic is someone who knows the true faith, departs from it, and encourages others to join him. For instance, the Catholic Church considers Luther a heretic. Modern day Lutherans, though, are not considered heretics, because they were born into that system. They never apostatized to a deranged doctrine and encouraged others to do so with them, because they were born to it.

Well, because specifically Roman Christianity is a top-down system, one has an account of various "official" definitions for terms like "heretic". A Catholic who becomes a Buddhist can only be officially declared a "heretic" by the Catholic Church if they can be fully proven to have had a complete and perfect understanding of the Catholic faith. Terms like "complete" and "perfect", needless to be said, are endlessly problematic, and as such, almost all apostates from Catholicism are not declared heretics, nor would they be if they were popular enough to warrant attention from the Holy See.

I don't know why Malcolm seems to warm up to Capitalism.

Malcolm wrote:
Market economies function better than command economies for the majority of the people in them. They are not perfect, however, which is why they require sensible and humane regulation.

For example, people rail against capitalism because they view it as being the cause of the present environmental crisis. This is really quite false, but it feels good to believe it be so. It's nice to have convenient scapegoats.

In reality, the actual cause of climate change is simply human ignorance, and in many cases, criminal indifference. And this applies universally, it is not a problem which can be isolated to this or that country, or this or that political economy. Climate change is the result of countless human decisions made since the 18th century, and especially after the adoption of concentrated hydrocarbons in the 19th century (coal, then oil) as sources for fuel and fertilizers leading to an explosion in human populations.

Unfortunately in the United States, the science of the matter has, absurdly, become a matter of ideological debate, just as environmentalism was ideologically discredited in the USSR in the 1930's, with its obvious effects on the environment in communist countries such as the USSR and elsewhere.

Many of the excesses of capitalism can be solved, among other measures, by pricing the cost of undeveloped capital in its raw form, as suggest in Natural Capitalism (Hawken, Lovins, and Lovins, 1999). The fundamental assumptions of Natural Capitalism are as follows: The limiting factor to future economic development is the availability and functionality of natural capital, in particular, life-supporting services that have no substitutes and currently have no market value.
Misconceived or badly designed business systems, population growth, and wasteful patterns of consumption are the primary causes of the loss of natural capital, and all three must be addressed to achieve a sustainable economy.
Future economic progress can best take place in democratic, market-based systems of production and distribution in which all forms of capital are fully valued, including human, manufactured, financial, and natural capital.
One of the keys to the most beneficial employment of people, money, and the environment is radical increases in resource productivity.
Human welfare is best served by improving the quality and flow of desired services delivered, rather than by merely increasing the total dollar flow. Economic and environmental sustainability depends on redressing global inequities of income and material well-being.

Annen in particular devoted great attention to this issue."

In the 20th century, no liberal democracy has ever indulged in the kind of wanton murder we find with authoritarian regimes of the right and the left. Capitalism is the economic system peculiar to liberal democracies. Marxists may have other definitions of capitalism; but in general capitalism only exists  in those countries where universal rights to private ownership of property are guaranteed by the State. In many respects, Capitalism as we understand it today, is a post-WWI phenomena, though it has its antecedents principally in the shift of the British economy from mercantilism to global free trade during the 19th century.

Regarding what is perceived or unperceived by the Buddha-eye, I was recently reviewing the Tathágatagarbhasútra:

In a similar fashion [as the visual miracle preceeding], good sons, when I regard all beings with my buddha eye, I see that hidden within the kleshas [negative mental traits] of greed, desire, anger, and stupidity there is seated augustly and unmovingly the tathagata's wisdom, the tathagata's vision, and the tathagata's body. Good sons, all beings, though they find themselves with all sorts of kleshas, have a tathagatagarbha that is eternally unsullied, and that is replete with virtues no different from my own

No, its definitely a story of Sariputra. I got the details wrong - not sure the actual source. The point was that he renounced the bodhisattva path, thereby setting himself back significantly. I've read versions where he then sank into samsara for a while before getting back on the path. Point stands, its easy to lop off your arm compared to the concentration needed to really advance on the path.


Malcolm wrote:
If you have not realized emptiness, then yes — however, Shariputra was not an bodhisattva mahāsattva at this point, he was an ordinary bodhisattva, below the path of seeing.

A bodhisattva mahāsattva, according to the Sarvapuṇya-samuccaya-samādhi sūtra, cannot fall into the faulty state of a śrāvaka. The Nirvana Sūtra states that a bodhisattva mahāsattva cannot be distracted by either the māra of afflictions or the māra of the aggregates and also says they have no fear of desire, hatred, ignorance, birth, aging, illness, death, or falling into hell realm, animal realm or preta realm because they dwell on the stage of fearlessness. The Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā-prajñāpāramitā states that a bodhisattva who courses in emptiness cannot fall to the stage of a pratyekabuddha or a śrāvaka.

Illustrating this point, I just recalled the story of Sariputra who was on the verge of Buddhahood in the past such that when a brahmin asked him for his eye, he plucked it out and gave it to him. When the brahmin tossed the eye away in disgust, Sariputra lost his concentration, got angry, and wiped out the stores of good karma. Concentration is hard - that's why even though we've given our lives for family, friends and rulers more times than we can count, we're still here.

On the verge of buddhahood? Not possible. Otherwise, you are elevating the notion of one-pointedness to a ridiculous extreme.

I think you are confusing your story with that of Nāgārjuna's disciple, Āryadeva. In that version, Āryadeva gives his eye to a blind beggar women who promptly eats it. He experiences a moment of regret, and because of that, his eye was not magically restored.

He who acquires his wealth in harmless ways

riches mount up for him
like ant hill's rapid growth.

With wealth acquired this way,
a layman fit for household life,
in portions four divides his wealth:
thus will he friendship win.

One portion for his wants he uses,[7] 
two portions on his business spends,
the fourth for times of need he keeps.

One of the reasons for Trump's rise is that inaccurate perception by some that globalism is depriving the US of jobs. Actually, globalism has shifted the lives of millions of people in China, Vietnam and so on. I think their attitudes towards being "oppressed" are rather different -- a generation ago, these people faced working in rice paddies for life. Now, it may be noble to work in rice paddies, and there are all kinds of reasons for why the disruption of subsistence living in many parts of the world is not a positive thing, but I doubt many of those people would go back to the rice paddies.

So it is fun and all to take shots at the US and white middle class males, but you, a white middle class male, are not going to change the world, and frankly, no one is. When I look around the world, what I see is that people who live in Western Europe and the US (as well as Canada, Australia, and NZ) have the best living conditions and as far as it goes, the most democracy.

3. "Student, beings are owners of kammas, heirs of kammas, they have kammas as their progenitor, kammas as their kin, kammas as their homing-place. It is kammas that differentiate beings according to inferiority and superiority."

Sometimes your level of political ignorance astounds even me.  I put it down to the dregs of McCarthyism that still infect Us political thought.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, and the Allies used Japanese soldiers to police areas of liberated Asia, German troops to police areas of Germany and so on.

Communists in Europe at that time were just as totalitarian as fascists.

Thus, it is still is better for you that the Allies (US, Britain, France) occupied Western Europe rather than the Soviets.

The Soviets, btw, never denazified east Germany or Austria, or the Ukraine, or any where else in their sphere of influence.

Once everything settled down after the war, the Allies systematically denazified West Germany, and defascsized Italy, etc.

Basically, I think your perspective is romantic. You are advocating for a social system that has never existed anywhere at any time because you are hopeful that humans beings are not as awful as we actually are.

I happen to think that all of the environmental damage wrought by humans in the last 500 years would have happened under any kind of possible economic system, driven largely by the Columbian exchange.

Finally, it may be the case that our views on these matters are, as suggested above, entirely cultural, the difference between Continental and Anglo-American perspectives.

As far as democratic socialism, Marx, in my opinion, never understood the Anglo-American system, and I do not think he understood democracy or the American revolution. His attitudes were born not within the sphere of Anglo-American ethics and jurisprudence, he was a devotee of Hegel, not Hume.

Streeck on the crucial challenge which any genuinely left-wing project must face:
Ultimately it will have to answer the question how it will convincingly communicate the need for a global modernity that learns to conserve resources, physical and social, rather than continuing to use them up; to switch from creative destruction to creative protection, including protection from excessive free trade (not leaving this to the Trumps of this world); to appreciate the economics of subsistence as opposed to expansion; to slow down rather than speed up; and to start a perestroyka that does not amount to uskoreniye, meaning acceleration, which was the late-communist reform project of Gorbachev, but to controlled deceleration, de-capitalization, more local development, more collectivism and solidarity – in short, a project as utopian as it can possibly be, but probably equally necessary

Maintaining that buddhas perceive relative truths is the same as maintaining they are deluded.

The omniscience of the buddha has two components, a buddha is omniscience about all that there is and they are omniscience about every aspect, but it is not the case that they perceive the world the way we do, because if they did, the consequence would be that the buddhas would be deluded.

The shear number of innocent people murdered by Communists and Fascists in the 20th century alone should make everyone as equally nervous about Marxist Socialism as they are about Fascism.

I don't have any experience with Tibetan astrology, and close to none with Indian one. But I am regularly using Western astrology as a source of understanding the current qualities of my mind. Tantric practice can be combined very well with astrology, certain transits are related in their quality to certain deities. For example, an important transit of Venus might go well with deities that are linked to the arts. This also is true for energy practices. During certain transits, especially those related to lunar nodes (which are linked in Indian astrology also with the kundalini energy), energy practice goes nearly by itself. In fact, there is a lot left for research between tantra and astrology, as there are only relatively few practitioners who are deeply knowledgeable and skilled in both systems. Also, conjunctions of planets with certain fixed stars or asteroids in the radix often are a good indicator to find out about special powers, or extraordinary personalities.

I don't know exactly how this works in a monastic setting, I believe basics of astrology is part of a typical Geshe training, but I don't know how many Geshes study the subject more in-depth. Malcolm would probably know more about this than I do.

The closing lines of the Lotus Sutra Life Span Chapter suggests an answer:

Practice the path and which do not,

I am always thinking:
By what means can I cause sentient beings to be able to
Enter the highest path
And quickly attain the Dharma?
Can we accurately conceive this thought? The Buddha tells us this, but can we truly understand the import of these words?

The Life Span Chapter opens with the Buddha's exhortation:
“O sons of a virtuous family! You should believe the true words of the Tathāgata.”

kathaṃ nu bodhāvupanāmayeyaṃ 
katha buddhadharmāṇa bhaveyu lābhinaḥ|

Always knowing their practices,
I likewise teach sentient beings
in order to place them by all means in awakening,
and that by all means they attain the buddhadharmas.

Here, buddhadharmas refers to the 18 unshared qualities, among others, that buddhas uniquely possess. It is a little hard therefore to accept imperatives such as:

kulaputrāḥ, abhiśraddadhadhvaṃ tathāgatasya bhūtāṃ vācaṃ vyāharataḥ

Sons of a good family, have faith and confidence in my words, the Tathāgata!

Not because what the Tathāgata says is false, but because so many translations of his words are blatantly flawed.

Gautama is just the latest Matryoshka Buddha who appeared here in Saha, with no original one, per se, because there is always another Primordial Buddha in the distant past, and there will be infinite further Buddhas, each a primordial Buddha for others long down the line.

Sorry, I completely disagree with Loppon Namdrol on the benefits of different types of malas for different practices. But then I'm a student of a ngakpa who urged His students to use this or that mala for certain (not all) practices. For me, the ten-drel is quite obvious.

There is no denying that different materials are described as being useful for different actions, or even deities.

However, there is also no denying that a bodhiseed mala covers all four actions and is suitable for all deities, bar none.

Turning over evils, there is virtue supporting them, like inside bamboo there being the nature of fire. It is not yet the object of fire, which is why it exists but does not burn. When meeting with conditions the phenomenon comes to exist, and then it can burn things.

It does not reflect the interpretation you are sharing.

For example, there is a passage where Garab Dorje asks, "How will the bonfire of pristine consciousness (jñāna) burn without the fuel of afflictions?" But this does not mean a buddha possesses afflictions. In a buddha, even the fire of pristine consciousness has gone out since there is nothing further for a buddha to purify, to know or to do with respect to a path and all their actions are spontaneous like the rewards that come from possessing a wishful fulfilling gem.

Is this ambiguous interpretation you give coming from the Ziporyn fellow's books?

The Buddha is discernible to us only as the enlightening function. The Buddha appears only in response to afflictions. The Buddha is the perfect liberation of afflictions and nothing more can actually be said of the Buddha without acknowledging that is just more upaya in response to our need to conceptualize the Buddha. We therefore say the Buddha is the complement of afflictions and can't be distinguished from afflictions. Further, if there are afflictions then there is Buddha response. As such, Buddha is said to be a part of the affliction-liberation complex. When this complex is defined in terms of Buddha, we say the Buddha includes the afflictions. When defined in terms of deluded being, we say the deluded being includes Buddha.

So are the latencies of Ven Zhiyi, such as the latent fire "inside" of bamboo at all times, is this fire still considered "fire" despite not manifesting, and functionally not existing for all intensive purposes until it is brought out? Are these latencies understood as manifestations?

According to Ven Zhiyi evil dwells in the Buddha like the latent fire inside of a stalk of bamboo, if the fire is caused to "come out" of the bamboo, then the causes and conditions for fire have come together.

A fully awakened Buddha has only latencies, no manifestations. Like a stalk of bamboo whose internal fires are never "brought out".

How does this interact with the "normal" Nichiren view presented earlier?

To contextualize my earlier quotation, which is one of my "pet" quotations that I post frequently, I will admit:

Furthermore, a single moment of thought in the mind of a common being possesses the ten realms. They completely possess the nature and characteristics of evil karma, yet the nature and characteristics of evil are the nature and characteristics of virtue. It is due to evil that there is virtue. Apart from evil there is no virtue. Turning over evils, there is virtue supporting them, like inside bamboo there being the nature of fire. It is not yet the object of fire, which is why it exists but does not burn. When meeting with conditions the phenomenon comes to exist, and then it can burn things. Evil as the nature of virtue is not yet an existent phenomenon. When it meets with conditions it become an existent phenomenon, and then there can be a turn to evil. It is like bamboo. Fire is emitted and returns, burning the bamboo. In evil there is virtue. When virtue comes to exist it returns, destroying the evil. This is why that which are the nature and characteristics of evil are the nature and characteristics of virtue. A single moment of thought of an ordinary being always possesses the consciousnesses, names and forms of the ten realms. The nature and characteristics of the path of suffering – they misunderstand this path of suffering, and saṃsāra remains expansive. This is misunderstanding the dharmakāya as the path of suffering. There is no separate dharmakāya apart from the path of suffering, like mistaking south as north, there is no separate south. If one realizes saṃsāra, then it is the dharmakāya. Thus it is said the nature and characteristics of the path of suffering are the nature and characteristics of the dharmakāya.

Malcolm wrote:
What the above says pretty clearly is that in a single moment of the mind of a sentient being there are "ten realms," six lokas plus four kinds of āryan beings.

This passage from 法华玄义 is essentially Madhyamaka, but I think that it and/or passages like it are sometimes used to underpin interpretations like the illarraza's above.

Or is Tiantai mostly a subject of scholars interested in religious history and it’s texts studied only by few Chan monks? I read, that Guoqing Temple is mostly a tourist site now and not a vibrant center of Buddhism anymore.

I hope we can discuss this more or share articles about modern Tiantai.

When I started out studying Buddhadharma many years ago, lacking any experience, I relied on śabdaprāmaṇā primarily, valid knowledge based on scripture. As I learned more, I increasingly  began to rely more on anumāna, inference. These days, I primarily rely on pratyakṣa, direct perception.

When one relies on direct perception, there is no need for inference, what need to mention scripture? Valid knowledge derived from scripture is the weakest, it must be supported with inference (i.e. reasoning, with is inference for others). Reasoning is stronger than scripture but weaker than direct perception.

Any true expression of Buddhadharma wants to move people in the direction of direct perception. Over reliance on scripture without accompanying reasoning causes unsound Buddhist dogmatism.

The Buddha is discernible to us only as the enlightening function. The Buddha appears only in response to afflictions. The Buddha is the perfect liberation of afflictions and nothing more can actually be said of the Buddha without acknowledging that is just more upaya in response to our need to conceptualize the Buddha. We therefore say the Buddha is the complement of afflictions and can't be distinguished from afflictions. Further, if there are afflictions then there is Buddha response. As such, Buddha is said to be a part of the affliction-liberation complex. When this complex is defined in terms of Buddha, we say the Buddha includes the afflictions. When defined in terms of deluded being, we say the deluded being includes Buddha.

Now if one knows and recognizes desire as desire when desire arises, and so on, then maybe one can say that at that moment bodhi begins to dawn every so slightly if that desire etc., does not lead to action which in turn leads inevitably to suffering. But if one excuses desire, etc., as bodhi and merely continues to inflame the three poisons, soon one will be joining all the buddhas in hell who don't know they are buddhas. Why, because they, like oneself, did not recognize the three poisons as the three poisons.

I have a Tendai background and practiced pure land (which I heartily repent) so my allusion wasn't a shot or being mean, it's just my frame of reference.
When I read in the Lotus Sutra that Amida was a replica Buddha preaching the Lotus Sutra in Sukhavati and we should abandon provisional paths, it entirely resonated and I abandoned the practice.

DGA said:
I leave it to you to determine if the Lotus Sutra actually makes such a claim about Amitabha (I don't think it does, but you can see for yourself).  What interests me in these posts is that a specific narrative about what a Buddha is and does, based on a related narrative about one sutra, could lead a Dharma practitioner to sincerely repent of having done serious Dharma practice.

I don't wish to condemn or commend this kind of action.  I'm just marking it as extraordinary and remarkable, because it seems to me that it is.

This is why I think it's worthwhile for Dharma practitioners to have some clarity on what the word "Buddha" means, and how the three kayas work:  your understanding of these matters can impact your practice dramatically.

However, the force of generating the initial thought of awakening are so powerful that as Santideva says:

The moment bodhicitta arises,
the wretched one confined in the prison of samsara
is called “a child of the Sugatas,” 
and worldly gods and people offer homage.

And the Avatamska states:

Child of good lineage, bodhicitta is the seed of Dharma of the Buddhas.

Some Buddhisms, not naming any in particular, not even the Buddhism of this subforum necessarily, seem to insist that ordinary beings are already completely enlightenment Buddhas & that there is no progress to be made, no afflictions to be lost, the radical thing is when this is believed of both the ultimate & conventional perspectives. It makes for a very triumphalist Buddhadharma, in which everyone is on a nonretrograding coaster for awakening, and there is no need to practice anything ever, because the results of the practice are already in fruition.

I suspect you are practicing Dharma to alleviate the suffering caused by afflictions for yourself and others, so your protest is merely rhetorical posturing.

The point was that you cited a passage from a sūtra which referred to āryabodhisattvas. But there are other bodhisattvas on the paths of application and accumulation, below the path of seeing. I was pointing out simply that any practice one with Mahāyāna motivation becomes a Mahāyāna practice, for example, if one ordains as a bhikṣu with the intent to attain buddhahood to liberate all sentient beings, that ordination becomes a Mahāyāna practice by definition. The true difference between Hinayāna and Mahāyāna is whether or not one practices Dharma with the intent to attain anuttarasamyaksambodhi or not.

This refers strictly to āryabodhisattvas. It does not refer to bodhisattvas on the paths of accumulation or application.

Astus said:
What I meant is that vow is not enough, one also needs some level of understanding, faith, renunciation, and compassion, since without those even the vow is baseless. So for instance the Surangama Sutra teaches that even before one enters the ten stages of faith, one must obtain "dry wisdom", called dry because it is without sensual desire. Then the ten stages of faith means faith, remembrance, zeal, wisdom, concentration, non-retrogression, protection of the Dharma, reflection, discipline, and vow show the necessary qualities needed to progress to the following three times ten stages, then four additional practices, until one reaches the ten bhumis.

Hyjeong wrote about those 55 levels:

"The fifty-five stations are simply the results obtained after resting the mind and removing falsities. Therefore, before completing the full (final) station (of buddhahood), if you reach level one, you will be satisfied with gaining a little and give rise to a pride in knowing and understanding the Dharma (completely). But in the end, if you enter great awareness (enlightenment), the former stations you passed through will all be illusions, and be useless states. Therefore a patriarchal teacher said, “I would rather die than walk through the fifty-five stations.”"
(Abstracts of the Essentials of the Mind Dharma, in Collected Works of Korean Buddhism, vol 3, p 231)

And Huangbo:

"there is fast and slow in realizing this mind: there are those who attain no-mind in a single moment of thought after hearing the Dharma; those who attain no-mind after [passing through] the ten faiths, the ten abodes, the ten practices, and the ten conversions; and those who attain no-mind after [passing through] the ten stages [of the bodhisattva]. In spite of the length of time it takes them to [attain it, once they] reside in no-mind there is nothing else to be cultivated or realized. Truly without anything to be attained, true and not false [is no-mind]. Whether it is attained in a single moment of thought or at the tenth stage [of the bodhisattva], its efficacy is identical. There are no further gradations of profundity, only the useless striving of successive eons."
(Essentials of the Transmission of Mind, in Zen Texts, BDK ed, p 16)

So Linji said:

"But because you students lack faith in yourselves, you run around seeking something outside. Even if, through your seeking, you did find something, that something would be nothing more than fancy descriptions in written words; never would you gain the mind of the living patriarch. Make no mistake, worthy Chan men! If you don’t find it here and now, you’ll go on transmigrating through the three realms for myriads of kalpas and thousands of lives, and, held in the clutch of captivating circumstances, be born in the wombs of asses or cows."

Dzogchen is a Mahāyāna system. Within Mahāyāna it belongs to uncommon Mahāyāna secret mantra. Within uncommon secret mantra, it belongs to the inner tantras.

The main difference between Dzogchen and other systems of Buddhadharma is that other systems of Buddhadharma practice are based on mind. Dzogchen practice, from the beginning, is based on jñāna. But if someone is really curious about what that means, they have to go and find some guru who is willing to instruct them.

It is not, an elitist system, however. Vajrahe, emanation of Śākyamuni and first human teacher of Dzogchen said, "if there is one student who is not interested in Dzogchen, that is too many. If there are 100 students interested in Dzogchen, that is too few."

Many people who wish to follow Buddhadharma do not wish to have a close relationship with a guru. This is perfectly fine. There are all kinds of strands of Buddhadharma where the relationship with a teacher is not so vital. For people who are not interested in that kind of relationship with a teacher there are all kinds of practices.

But anyone who wishes to follow Dzogchen teachings must have a guru. There is no other way.

It should go without saying, but in Vajrayāna, the principle that women can attain samyaksambodhi in female form is axiomatic and exemplified in the story of Āryatārā. She is an example of a women who vowed to attain samyaksambodhi in female form and then did so.

Coëmgenu said:
This is very interesting. I presume that they were not a 'sūtra-school' in the East Asian sense (most alleged 'sūtra-schools' aren't), how were they distinctive? I presume they held the Tathāgatagarbhasūtrāṇi in high regard, but why are they named after them? Are they the specific 'school'/'body'/'community' that preserved this specific Buddhavacana, the 'Tathāgatagarbha ones', and proliferated it over the course of the Great Vast-Expansion/Mahāvaipulya?

Malcolm wrote:
Mahāyāna schools in India were "doctrine" schools, that is, they followed the lead of esteemed commentators like Nāgārjuna and Maitreyanatha for guidance in how to understand the contents of whole classes of sūtras.

It may be the case that at one time there were sūtra schools, but we have no records of such movements.

Basically, Maitreyanath identified three main streams of Mahāyāna thought, Tathāgatagarbha, Prajñāpāramitā, and Yogacāra, and wrote independent commentaries on each main stream. He then synthesized these three streams in his Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra. I call this the Maitreyan synthesis, since it was the most radical thing in Mahāyāna since Nāgārjuna. It indelibly stamped how Mahāyāna was studied in Indian Universities after the 6th century; and after these treatises were introduced to Tibet are the major source of controversy in Tibetan Buddhism.

It appears that in India the Uttaratantra received very little attention in India. The most attention was paid to the Abhisamayālaṃkāra, since it treated the Prajñāpāramitā, and proposed to unpack the stages of the path that were present in a hidden form within the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras. There is a rich commentarial tradition of debate between Madhyamaka and Yogacāra authors about this text.

Thus, in Tibetan Buddhism, there are three main controversies: 1) how are we to understand the Uttaratantra— is it definitive or provisional; 2) how are we to understand differences among various Indian Madhyamakas, the so-called prasanga/svatantra controversy; and 3) how are we to understand the three natures theory of the Yogacārins.

The texts which are followed in a manner similar to East Asian Buddhists are the tantras: the main exegetical tantra of both the Sakya and Kagyu school is the Hevajra Tantra and its commentaries; the Gelugpas base their exegesis of Vajrayāna on Guhyasamaja, the Nyingmapas on the Guhyagarbha (which can be classified as a tathāgatagarbha influenced text), and the Jonangpas base themselves on the Kalācakra Tantra.

For example, the Akṣayamatinirdeśa explains:

Furthermore, the meditation of the four close placement of mindfulness of bodhisattvas is not concluded. If it is what are the four, it is like this: the close placement of mindfulness of scrutinizing the body in the body, the close placement of mindfulness of scrutinizing sensations in sensations, the close placement of mindfulness of scrutinizing the mind in the mind, and the close placement of mindfulness of scrutinizing the phenomena in the phenomena. What is the bodhisattva's close placement of mindfulness of scrutinizing the body in the body? If asked about the bodhisattva's scrutinizing and dwelling on the body in the body, it is scrutinizing and dwelling on his own and other bodies: considering the prior limit of the body, considered the posterior limit of the body, also considering how the body arises in the present, that is, "Alas, the body arises from error, is formed by cause and condition, lacks sensation, lacks agency, lacks an owner, is not property, and is produced by causes and conditions. In this way, for example, it is like the grass outside, a branch of a tree, its sap, and a forest, these are all produced by cause and condition, lack sensation, lack agency, lack an owner, and are not property. In the same way, this body is like a grass, a branch of a tree, sap, a forest, trees, walls, or an optical illusion. That which is grasped by aggregates, sense elements, and sense bases lacks sensation, lacks agency, lacks an owner, is not property, and it empty of phenomena of I, mine, permanence, stability, perpetuity, immovability, invulnerability, and immutablity. There is nothing that to be taken as mine in this body, however, this body that lacks an essential self will attain the essence, samyaksambodhi [...]

Tathāgatagarbha was a separate tradition from Madhyamaka and Yogacāra in India; thus there is no reason why it should not have been introduced to China as an independent tradition as well, prior to the Maitreyan synthesis.

There are far more sources for the four foundations of mindfulness than that sutta. Mahāyāna is very rich with them.

Consciousness was not switched on, like a light switch, it developed gradually as my body grew, in my mother's womb, and after I was born.

If I take away the atoms of my brain, atom by atom, slowly my consciousness will fade until it's not there.

It won't suddenly disappear, like a light going out.

There's no "first moment of conception" of consciousness any more than there is a "first moment of tree" from a seed.

PS: There's no more reason to think that when I remove the final atoms of my brain 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... a "next mind" suddenly is somehow produced somewhere any more than when the atoms of the brain of a fetus accumulate 1 ... 2 ... 3 ... then consciousness suddenly is produced from a "previous mind".

Malcolm wrote:
Dharmakirti's heuristic indicates it is pointless to discuss this issue with someone who holds a physicalist perspective, such as Carvakas/Lokayatis. His heuristic is not meant to convince materialists to abandon their views. His heuristic is aimed at eternalists who adhere to a view of a permanent self.

Thus, if you actually think your consciousness arises from your body, there really is no point for you to study Buddhism at all. Not only are you wasting your time, you are wasting the time of others by seeking to engage in them in something in which you have no confidence.

We are talking about rebirth, not sense consciousness. In other words we are talking about the link, consciousness, not the link, sensation.

Dharmakīrti will happily agree that a a direct perception of blue requires a blue object. However, from where does the mind arise at the first moment of conception? If it is restricted to this life, your examples fail because at this point there are no senses and no sense organs. There is only namarūpa. The point Dharnakīrti is driving home is that one has to decide if consciousness is something that arises from the body or not. If consciousness is only something that arises through physical contact, then this also eliminates mental consciousness, since a mental consciousness by definition takes a mental object as a sense base and arises on the basis of contact with that.

If we follow your example, there are only ten ayatanas, fifteen dhātus, or one skandha.

If however one decides that the consciousness is not produced by the body, then consciousness requires another cause that is not the body.

Fine.

Malcolm, you re-state Dharmakirti's argument as follows:

Malcolm wrote:
All conditioned things have causes. Mind, being conditioned, has a cause. If mind has a material cause it must come from the body.
If mind does not have a material cause it must have a nonmaterial cause.
If the mind has a nonmaterial cause it must be conditioned, since the unconditioned has no causal action.
The only nonmaterial thing that can cause mind is mind.
Since mind streams are unique and independent, this present moment of mind must have as its cause a previous moment of mind.
Since the mind does not arise from matter, then, this life's first moment of consciousness at conception must have its cause in a previous moment of mind prior to conception.

PuerAzaelis said:
This cannot be his full argument, since there is no premise or argument that shows that the mind does not arise from matter.

Malcolm wrote:
I did not say it was his full argument. I stated it was his heuristic.

Basically, the argument that mind cannot arise from matter is that mind cannot arise from the four elements, since matter and mind are different kinds of substance (dravya), and just as material entities of different continua cannot arise from one another, i.e. corn cannot grow from wheat seeds, likewise, matter cannot produce mind nor can mind arise from matter.

When the Buddha grouped phenomena, he did so into six distinct dhātus; solids (earth), liquids (water), gases (air), heat (fire), space, and consciousness.

Four of these dhātus are material, two are nonmaterial. They are all nevertheless "substances." (dravya).

The issue before us is whether or not a guru can violate that trust. Some literalists will say no, it is not possible. I think it is possible and happens quite a bit, actually, especially to women. Then there is the the sticky point of when one has genuinely entered into a true relationship with a guru, at what point does this occur? I don't think this necessarily happens just because one has received an empowerment.

Malcolm wrote:
Professor Nattier does not actually specify just what is was that Thubten the monk found challenging. She actually does not know, so she guesses:

rory said:
Rather, in the Lotusthe very idea of a path is radically undermined. Instead, practice is fulfilled by accepting, in all humility, Shakyamuni’s word that through faith one will attain Buddhahood in the future. As the closing lines of chapter 2 of the sutra put it, “Have no further doubts; rejoice greatly in your hearts, knowing that you will become Buddhas.”

It is this, I suspect, that was the primary cause of Thubten’s consternation. Although Tibetan Buddhism has largely jettisoned arhatship as a valid goal, it has maintained a strong commitment to the notion of spiritual cultivation. To hear the Buddha proclaim that every practitioner is destined for Buddhahood—even those who, like the legendary betrayer of the dharma, Devadatta, are guilty of heinous crimes—would seem to subvert the very foundation of the long and demanding practice of the bodhisattva path.

Malcolm wrote:
Such a statement does not undermine the need for a long and strenuous path, it is in fact a remedy for some Hinayāna notions that to attain buddhahood as a buddha, one must be a bodhisattva specifically predicted by a Buddha such as Dipaṃkara Buddha (as in the case of Śākyamuni himself in a past life) and so on. So here, in the Lotus, the Buddha is predicting all sentient beings for eventual buddhahood.

This is not even slightly controversial in Tibetan Buddhism (not that you will pay attention to a single word I say). For example, Master Sonam Tsemo states:

The fourth is the position of some masters among the followers of the Saddharmapundarika-sūtra.

That is, that there is a single result for the three paths, citing the parable of the burning house. The idea of Ekayāna is noncontroversial in Tibetan Buddhism.

When there is an analysis of vehicles it is from the point of view of inclination, not from the point of view of the result. There is only one result.

You should not conflate Abhidhamma with Abhidharma.

Queequeg said:
According to tradition, the essence of the Abhidhamma was formulated by the Buddha during the fourth week after his Enlightenment.[1] Seven years later he is said to have spent three consecutive months preaching it in its entirety in one of the deva realms, before an audience of thousands of devas (including his late mother, the former Queen Maya), each day briefly commuting back to the human realm to convey to Ven. Sariputta the essence of what he had just taught.[2] Sariputta mastered the Abhidhamma and codified it into roughly its present form. Although parts of the Abhidhamma were recited at the earlier Buddhist Councils, it wasn't until the Third Council (ca. 250 BCE) that it became fixed into its present form as the third and final Pitaka of the canon.[3]

Malcolm wrote:
https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/tip ... index.html

Abhidhamma is indeed held to be direct Buddhavacana.

Abhidharma is not, which is why we has a system of tenets.

Abhidharma is held to be the advanced discussion of arhats concerning the detailed and advanced points of the Agamas, Vinaya, etc. In Abhidharma, it is generally considered that the Sautrantikas are more authoritative than the Vaibhashikas because the Sautrantikas hold up Vaibhashika tenets to scrutiny viz. the Agamic sūtras.

Even so, "Abhidharma" still means "higher dharma." Everyone should study Abhidharma. If they did, it would end a lot of senseless conversations and prevent myriads more.

Sakya Pandita states:

"Criticism" does not refer to criticizing the master out of some slight anger. "Criticism" refers to statements such as "This master is evil, with corrupted discipline, who does not act according to the Dharma, and so on. Such criticisms result in a downfall.

In other words, in order to commit this downfall, one has to make extremely negative statements about a qualified master from whom one has received teachings. Minor criticisms do not constitute a downfall.

Sonam Wangchug said:
Since you are quoting from a Sakya master, it might be helpful to consider the perspective of the current head of the Sakya tradition.

Malcolm wrote:
What HHST says is perfect, but your citing it here is beside the point, because he is not contradicting Sakya Pandita, whose small commentary on samaya is quoted universally by everyone in all four schools as authoritative.

In order to have committed the downfall of criticizing a qualified master, one has to go the extreme mentioned by Sapan. The point of mentioning these things is not to encourage people to go around criticizing their gurus. The point of mentioned such things is to relieve people of the anxiety of thinking they have broken samaya merely because they may have uttered a critical word about their gurus in an unguarded moment of affliction. Sapan makes it very clear that such afflicted speech does not constitute a root downfall. A root downfall only occurs if one denies that one's qualified guru is actually a qualified guru. That is what "criticism" ( brnyas pa ) means.

Now then, in these kinds of discussions is best to keep ones remarks relevant to the topic at hand.

Secondly, In fact, there is no actual samaya to regard to one's root guru as a perfect being (though it is recommended that it is best if one can). Good thing too, since if there was such a samaya, no one would be able to keep samaya at all.

And of course, since in reality virtually no one can maintain this kind of pure conceptual perception, we do not, in general, practice guru yoga with the ordinary form of our guru, we visualize them in the form of a Buddha such as Vajradhāra, or Guru Rinpoche, etc. Why? Because it is recognized maintaining pure perception of our root guru is in fact difficult, and not easy, and for beginners, impossible.

Also, in the Nyingma tradition, minor criticism of one's root guru does not result in a downfall either. Merely having an afflictive verbal response to something the guru does or says simply does not qualify as a downfall.

Finally, the whole point of practicing Dharma is to overcome afflictions. Sometimes our gurus behave strangely. Of course we have to learn to be flexible and not immediately decide we have made a poor choice in gurus and move on. Nevertheless, if while sincerely following a teacher we are overcome with affliction and voice our critical displeasure at this or that thing our guru does, this does not constitute a downfall; and whatever verbal nonvirtue we may have incurred as a result of some minor criticism we may make of our guru is easily rectified —— this is why we have so many methods of purification, from Vajrasattva to the completion stage (yes, this is the best way to purify all downfalls — look it up).

So, when you experience that knee-jerk reflex to go off on something you see that I have said on the forum, think twice about what I have said before you go posting irrelevant rebuttals to things I have not said.

Nobody wants to blame the sexual revolution of the 60s for this grotesqueness?

Malcolm wrote:
Absolutely not. It was much worse for women in the 1960's and before. Before the 1960's, if husband beat his wife and kids, no one would interfere, not the cops, not the courts, and not the schools. Moreover, male infidelity was considered normal. Patting women in the ass, making lewd comments at work, etc., were all commonplace, not exceptions, and certainly no one would have been fired for what people are being dismissed for today.

Moreover, the sexual revolution was not a revolution at all in terms of how women were treated. The "revolution," such as it was, was that men were able to have sex with women without major fear of pregnancy. But "sexual revolution" merely exposed how one sided things were for women. Thus, women, taking a clue from the civil rights movement, started the feminist movement. Sadly, Europe is still very backwards when it comes to women's rights. This is why Buddhist teachers who like assaulting women avoid the US.

There is a huge tendency in Vajrayāna to encourage sycophancy and dependence amongst disciples. Many people do not understand that there are limits to the guru's authority. For example, Sapan also states with great clarity:

If he does not teach according to the words of the Buddha,
even if he is one’s guru, one should remain indifferent.

This is not to say that we can get anywhere on our own in the Buddhist path, The Tattvāvatāra states:

The all-knowing one praises reliance on a guru,
not the independence of a disciple. 
A blind person is not independent, 
unable to climb a mountain.

Nevertheless, we must temper our understaing of the need to rely on a qualified master with common sense, so we do not wind up creating Buddhist cults which merely keep people imprisoned cages that seem like Dharma but are actually just clever prisons.

Adzom Drukpa is also a tulku, ultimately of the Drukpa Kagyu polymath, Pema Karpo.

A bodhisattva on the first bodhisattva stage can have 100 emanations. I assume all these emanations are independent, but should they choose, they can be aware of each other since in some sense they are one continuum.




Seeker12 said:
In terms of a conceptual understanding of such statements, how do you reconcile such a statement with the idea that many Dzogchen masters have had numerous incarnations? Even ChNN is considered to be a tulku himself from a previous Dzogchen master.

Is it simply considered, for example, that he is then an emanation of a Buddha? In other words, if that's not the case, how could there be more than two 'births' from such individuals? Does it simply have to do with subtle understandings of what birth and death mean, what Buddhahood is, etc?


Malcolm wrote:
Tulkus are something relative, it is a social phenomena. When a Dzogchen practitioner passes away, each grade of practitioner will have a given number of emanations, will remain in the bardo of dharmatā for a set length of time and so on. It is not necessary to recognize all these emanations as tulkus. Ordinary people are also recognized as tulkus. Actually, all of us are tulkus. Some of us are tulkus of samsara, others tulkus of nirvana.

Seeker12 said:
Thank you for responding.

In general, my interest is not in whether or not someone is recognized as a tulku but rather trying to fit together the teachings coherently.

So with that said, a further question/clarification. If we take the case of ChNN, he is said to be the reincarnation of Adzom Drukpa. As I recall, he didn't particularly like this idea until he wrote a commentary which was almost word-for-word identical to that of a commentary by Adzom Drukpa, at which point he maybe accepted this to be true.

In another thread, as I recall, you have said that Dharmakirti argues that mindstreams are distinct. I will presume that you hold this view as well, although it wasn't explicitly said.

If this is the case, then, are we to understand that ChNN is the same mindstream as Adzom Drukpa? Or is ChNN simply one of many emanation bodies of Adzom Drukpa, the number of which is determined by the grade of his realization? Or are we to consider that ChNN is actually a fully enlightened Buddha himself that is simply manifesting as he is, which would mean that Adzom Drukpa did in fact achieve Buddhahood either during his life or shortly afterwards.

If none of those apply, and ChNN is in fact A) the same mindstream as Adzom Drukpa, and B) not a samyaksambuddha either currently or at least during this life, then I don't see how the teachings on all Dzogchen practitioners attaining samyaksambodhi in this life or shortly afterwards really fit together.

Of course, another option would be that the two are actually not related at all - that they are separate mindstreams - and the whole 'tulku' or 'reincarnation' aspect is simply mistaken.

I hope my question is clear. Thanks for any consideration.

Commensurate, sure, but not the same.

Commensurate means equivalent. Buddhanature is not equivalent to buddhahood.

Right. So, in the end, I get your criticisms. Noted. But there's nothing definitive.

Malcolm wrote:
In the end, it appears to me that the Chinese needed to supply a historical context for a foreign religion, one the Indians had no need to provide for themselves. This has lead to a number of innovations in Chinese Buddhism that would never occur in the land of Buddhism's birth. We see very similar trends in Tibetan Buddhology.

It is interesting, but there are some funny mistakes like this footnote:


For example, see Norbu and Lipman 2001, p. 65, and p.121, lines 124-127. This passage quotes an unnamed teacher as stating that “pure symbolic consumption is also bodhicitta”: brda can yang dag len pa’ang byang chub yin zhes ston pas gsung. This probably denotes the ritual consumption of semen in the practice of sbyor ba. The same passage also refers to the Three Samādhi (ting ’dzin gsum po), and the Great Seal of the Dharma (chos kyi phyag rgya chen po).

In fact the line reads:

Furthermore, since the teacher has declared that awakening can be correctly grasped with a symbol,
in that case, this is the basis of the meditation that generates awakened mind. 
After the three samadhis are stable and after binding the three symbolic mudras, 
generate the mind as the great dharmamudra and meditate the recitation of the essence [mantra].

Mipham's comment, based on the commentary found in the Tengyur, states:

If it is asked, “What is the method for realizing the definitive meaning through the indirect method?,” since nonactivity is illustrated with the activity of fabricated efforts, like pointing at the moon with a finger, also awakened mind correctly grasped through a symbol will accomplish awakening because the Bhagavan Buddha, the teacher of devas and humans, has declared that it is “great awakening.” Any unfortunate one who conceptualizes entities should make efforts in the indirect method of realization.
 
In that case, this which is to be explained is the basis or cause of the meditation that generates ultimate awakened mind itself. If it is asked what that is, it is samadhi and mudra. 

Now then, through the power of cultivating the three samadhis of suchness, universal illumination and the cause, [14/a] one will be stable, and not carried away by negative conditions. After the meditation of binding the three symbolic mudras of buddhahood— the body (mahāmudra), the mind (samaya mudra), and the activities (karmamudra)—generate the mind as the great dharmamudra (the symbol of speech). One should then meditate the recitation of the essence mantra.

If one meditates generating the thought that the samadhis and the mudras are dharmatā and therefore are not different, the ultimate awakened mind will arise. If one actualizes the meditation, one realizes that all phenomena do not exist apart from one’s mind. The accumulations are gathered and obscurations are purified because of that meditation. One becomes realized because one’s continuum is blessed by the deity of pristine consciousness.

I just don't see any ritual consumption of semen in this text, damn!

Seeker12 said:
In terms of a conceptual understanding of such statements, how do you reconcile such a statement with the idea that many Dzogchen masters have had numerous incarnations? Even ChNN is considered to be a tulku himself from a previous Dzogchen master.

Is it simply considered, for example, that he is then an emanation of a Buddha? In other words, if that's not the case, how could there be more than two 'births' from such individuals? Does it simply have to do with subtle understandings of what birth and death mean, what Buddhahood is, etc?


Malcolm wrote:
Tulkus are something relative, it is a social phenomena. When a Dzogchen practitioner passes away, each grade of practitioner will have a given number of emanations, will remain in the bardo of dharmatā for a set length of time and so on. It is not necessary to recognize all these emanations as tulkus. Ordinary people are also recognized as tulkus. Actually, all of us are tulkus. Some of us are tulkus of samsara, others tulkus of nirvana.

That is a complete misrepresentation. Sinitic Buddhism is just fine.

In particular, I find it fascinating that Chinese Buddhists latched onto individual sūtras like the Saddhamapundarika and the Avatamska and formulated whole systems of thought out of them, a trend which is notably absent in Indian Buddhism.

If Huayen [Kegon] was a living school I am sure that a lively conversation would ensue with them as well.

At base, the most interesting phenomena in these discussions is the unwillingness of my fellow discussants to simply admit that their acceptance or rejection of Lotus Buddhism for example, is based on very little else other than their own proclivity towards it. Instead they try to argue their adherence to this school of Buddhism is based on some objective measure which can be found in the words of the Lotus Sūtra, forgetting the only reason they believe this is that they chose to believe it and nothing more.

I for one am certainly willing to admit that my choice of practice schools is based on my own personal proclivities, and that I accept what I accept based purely on my own authority and I do not pretend that my biases are enshrined in the words of the Buddha.

That, in large part, is because I have serious doubts about this notion that we can actually say that the Saddharmapundarika was taught towards the end of the Buddha's life. There is certainly no internal indication that this is the case.

Further, it brings up another point — if the Saddharmapunadarika is  the final word, why would the Buddha bother to go on to teach the Nirvana Sūtra? Clearly, the Nirvana Sūtra comes later, since it mentions the Saddharmapunadarika by name due to its giving a prediction of buddhahood to the eighty mahāśrāvakas. It also mentions the Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra.

That is the only Indic commentary that has survived. And, he is definitely not Chinese. There are semantic markers in Tibetan that distinguish translations from Sanskrit and translations from Chinese. This is very clear, for example, when you compare the Tibetan translation of the Nirvana Sūtra from Sanskrit and Chinese respectively.

Themes from the Saddharmapundarika Sūtra are cited quite frequently in Indian and Tibetan Buddhist sources. In other words, there are more sources than that commentary, and in fact, the way those sources use the Saddharmapundarika indicates what Indians found important and what they ignored. They cared little for historical assertions, for example, the three turnings of the wheel mentioned in the Samdhinirmocana, and tended to focus on that which was of doctrinal significance. Granted, this perspective is an exegetical perspective, and apart from inscriptions, we have almost no evidence of how these sūtras might have actually been treated in devotional communities in India.

He decided that since he was already there, there was no need for the hell guardians to torture the other beings there, and asked them to mete out the punishments meant for others upon him. This was his first glimmer of compassion.

Because of compassion, we generate bodhicitta; through generating bodhicitta; we continue on a path. Sooner or later, we also attain buddhahood. No compassion, no bodhicitta; no bodhicitta, no buddha.

Queequeg said:
Please elaborate.

Malcolm wrote:
Quite frankly, the Chinese were a highly literate culture when they encountered Buddhadharma. They had already a very refined sense of literary aesthetics. Sutras like the PP Sūtras, the Yogacara Sūtras, are very Abhidharmic in their scope and language, and really, have very little narrative value. It is telling that Pramāṇa (aka Buddhist epistemology) never got off the ground in China. It is equally telling that such classics as the Maitreyan synthesis and so on were largely ignored in China, something really only Yogacara geeks like Xuantsang were into. It is not surprising therefore that the two sūtras with the grandest narrative structures, the Lotus and the Avatamska, came to be the two dominant and competing exegetical schools in China.

What strikes me repeatedly in these exchanges is how much you all value a great masterpiece of world literature without having much care for its place in the society that generated it, how little you care about its original context and range of influence.

It strikes me that for you, Buddhism begins in China in the fifth century, and anything that does not fit in with Tientai historiography is just flat out ignored.

Of course you do, you went to Law School, but I will explain. Nichiren viewed himself as an emanation of Vajrapani, a.k.a., Mahāsthāmaprāpta. This identification was bound up in his personal mission to teach his unique approach to the Lotus Sūtra as a) the defining document of Buddhism in Mappo, and b) the principle means of attaining awakening was honoring this document through through meditation and recitation based on the elaborate hermeneutics that developed in the Tendai school over time, which were also deeply infused with Buddhist esotericism, simplified however in order to ensure popular appeal. Those who accept Nichiren's approach do so based on the teleology of the five periods of the Dharma. Unique, however, to the Nichiren school in general is the conviction that all other forms of Dharma practice have been utterly superseded and are worthless.

Aside from Hakuin's incorporation of breath techniques, do you know of any other Buddhist school in East Asia that did something similar?

Meido said:
The general approach to Zen practice as a yogic or wholly psycho-physical undertaking rather than something purely psychological and intellectual doesn't originate with Hakuin, as I have said before in other threads. The records of early (Kamakura) Zen in Japan clearly show that this emphasis existed strongly in the teachings of the late Song Chan masters (e.g. Bukko) who arrived in Japan.

I can't speak for other E. Asian Buddhist schools, except to say that my experience training with a modern Chan teacher revealed the same understanding.

~ Meido

Malcolm wrote:
The arrival of Bodhidharma to China corresponds with an increased incorporation of anatomical and medical understandings of the relation of the human body to practice in India. Depending on when you think he arrived, he arrived either slightly before or slightly after the fall of the Gupta empire. It must be the case that he carried these kinds of instructions with him, though whether they were passed on in any significant way is anybody's guess.

In any case, sūtras like the Suvarnaprabhaṣa, the Nandagarbhavikranti, etc., exhibit a sophisticated knowledge of Ayurveda, and so on. As we know, these trends reached their apogee in the 10th century when Indian Vajrayāna grounded its entire practice in a specific understanding of the physiology and anatomy of the body. However, we also see an approach to this understanding in the so-called lower tantras which date to the 7th century.

In general, Mahayāna yogis began to incorporate these kinds of understandings into their practice, which in my opinion was first promulgated in the form of upadeśas to close disciples. Perhaps these Indian techniques never gained the popularity they experienced in India and the Himalayas because China already had a sophisticated medical system with an elaborate and functional anatomy and physiology. In any case, after the fall of the Gupta, In India we see the evolution of body-based systems of practice and trend away from the intellectual edifices of Madhyamaka and Yogacara, a trend away from intellectual analysis towards yogic experience. It is obvious to me, that this fusion of yogic praxis with local understandings of anatomy and physiology becomes a more prominent feature of Mahāyana practice as time moves on. For example, in Tibet, the vast intellectual edifice of Dzogchen Upadesha teachings (as opposed to the mind series and space series) serves merely to articulate the technical principles of the body-based experience which is crucial in Dzogchen Upadesha teachings, and without which there is no Dzogchen Upadesha practice to speak of. My point is that there is no reason to assume that Chan and Zen practice are not similarly influenced by body-based yogic experience, and that there has been very little translated yet into English that really speaks to such things — since academic scholars are generally more interested in intellectual analysis, even when they dress it up in poetry.

Found a relevant quote which explains it for me:
http://ichinensanzen.ca/dependent-origi ... ependence/... ‘oneself’ and the ‘environment’ are a mutually co-arising phenomena of causes and conditions that simultaneously give rise each other. This transforms our basic understanding of cause and effect from one cause leading to an effect in a linear delineated fashion, to everything everywhere being both the cause and effect at the same time. This is also known as the simultaneity of cause and effect, which is in fact suggesting that there is no start or end to anything; everything is a borderless continuing process where all phenomena co-arise simultaneously ad infinitum as causes and conditions.

Malcolm wrote:
This is not particularly interesting. All conditioned things are simultaneously causes and effects.

Moreover, there is in Abhidharma a simple concept called karana-hetu. It simply means that everything is a cause of everything other thing apart from itself. It is one of the six causes.

Moreover, there are four conditions, the causal condition, the dominant condition (aka karana-hetu), the object condition and the immediately antecedent and simultaneous condition.

Nāgārjuna systematically dismantles these one by one. Thus, arising from conditions is merely a convention and does not signify anything real.

This sounds a lot to me like the scientific method, i.e. there is a hypothesis, an experiment and a result.

I am afraid you don't understand Rinpoche's point. His point is very simple. It is easy to have misconceptions about thogal teachings if you read them without proper preparation. We see this all the time — people have wild fantasies based on so called "Dzogchen" cosmology, that is, how appearance of the basis arise from the basis, and what "basis" actually means.

When you have misconceptions about Dzogchen teachings, you will block your realization.

Now then, ChNN never said to anyone, "You cannot read thogal texts until you receive thogal teachings from me." He said, "You should not read thogal texts until you have received thogal teachings in a proper way."

Moreover, the presentation of the lamps is markedly different in these two different Dzogchen traditions, their names are different, and so on. Thus, while their meaning is the same, goal is the same, etc., they are different traditions and need to be respected. Just because you have received Bonpo teachings on Dzogchen does not mean you have the proper transmission to read any Buddhist thogal text. There are important differences in the two traditions based on terminology, and so on. Basically, if you want their transmissions, you must go out and seek them from someone qualified to give them, but not just start reading books because after all, we have the first amendment.

Indeed, I definitely consider ChNN my root Guru. I also take teachings with TWR, and have (very periodic) access to him in person. I am not bothered by the Bön/Buddhist dichotomy, for whatever reason, nor am I concerned in this conversation with some people's opinion's on TWR's books, opinions on Kyab Rig or whatever - just for the record, and to keep on topic.

Unfortunately, I am pretty sure I will never be able to get Thogal instructions, and perhaps no in person instruction at all from ChNN, even though he is my root teacher. I have thus far followed Rinpoche's advice on this  to the letter, including skipping parts of books (e.g. Heart Drops) that I already owned and hadn't read yet when I found out his position, so I have followed his rule.

The dilemma is, am I supposed to do that forever, since I can never have in person instructions from ChNN on Thogal? I mean it isn't the hugest deal as I would never try to follow instructions from a book on something like Thogal anyway, and I am nowhere near ready for it, but it does seem to preclude me from reading a number of things I am interested in indefinitely. this coupled with the fact that Bönpo teachers seem to view it differently makes for some confusing decisions when I am deciding whether or not to try reading something. perhaps I should simply read less.

Was he supposed to take part on the creation of this book? Or how did he ommit him?

Sorry that was a bit confusing.  Totally off topic.  I was referring to Khyentse Wangchug not appearing in the lineage tree found in this book.

If the teaching in question is correct, than perhaps this is an illustration of a shortfall of the general tradition of basing perspectives of Buddhadharma around particular sūtrāṇi.

Yes. The Indians never had this custom.

Coëmgenu said:
the narrative that "There is no buddhahood/ in the desire realm or the formless realm." is quite problematized, if not outrightly rejected.

People often ignore what sūtras actually say.

Well, I said that this was a particularly Tibetan belief, because this strata of Indian Buddhism only survives in Tibet.

Oh no, I referred to the interpretation of it.

He is a student of ChNN, in other words he considers ChNN his root guru. He asked for advice. We told him what his guru thinks. It is really that simple.

I happen to like 19th century translations with verse as verse. It's a matter of preference, and it also requires more skill on the part of the translator.

Malcolm wrote:
If you like clumsy, non-idiomatic translations,  go for it.

Factually speaking however, you could never get the MMK into rhyme in English. You can't even really get into anything resembling a meter without doing violence to the text.

Go ahead, try. You will see what a dismal failure it is. Also, most of these 19th century translations are very, very, poor.

Isn't 'politics' singular?

"Politic" refers to the body politic, not politics.

OK, this is interesting. With reference to https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/searc ... q=politics I feel that TC was using  'politics' in either the second, third or fourth senses listed there and apparently in those senses it can take either a singular or plural verb, something I didn't know. I can say that as a native American English speaker I find "US politics is boring" much more natural sounding.
