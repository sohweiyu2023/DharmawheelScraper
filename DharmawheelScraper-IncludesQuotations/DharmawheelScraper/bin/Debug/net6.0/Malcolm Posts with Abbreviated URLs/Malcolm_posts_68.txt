No, I don't really believe there was a normative Indian position. There were normative Tibetan biases about what more modern Madhyamaka teachings they were going to seek because of Atisha, but this does not mean that Atisha position was even a majority position in India. Recall too, Atisha, while proclaiming Candrakirti's virtue, never had anything of his translated. Instead Atisha sponsored the translation of Pseudo-Bhavaviveka's Tarkajvala, etc.

Also keep in mind that "Candrakirti's" popularity most likely had more to do with the tantric Candrakirti's commentaries on the Pañcakrama than Madhyamaka.

So to summarize the errors of those who promote Tathāgatagarbha Sutras.

1.  They don't understand all the normative ancient Indian professors like Atisha said Madhyamaka was the definitive sutra teaching.

Malcolm wrote:
Just to be fair: Longchenpa states very clearly in the sgrub mtha' mdzod that Prasanga is the definitive view, Tathāgatagrbha sutras are the definitive sutras.

Second, there was in India a broad group of masters who dissented from the position you ascribe. Recall, Atisha is very, very late on the scene and had virtually no influence on Indian Buddhism that is presently discernible, apart from being a younger contemporary of Naropa, Ratnakarashanti, Vageshvarakirit, and so on.

Also, Candrakirti seems to have left very little lasting impression on Indian Madhyamaka until Atisha's time, when his works began to be upheld with enthusiasm. This is evident by the controversy they eventually sparked, leading the composition of such texts as Ratnakarashanti's (Yogacara) Madhyamaka-alaṃkara.

nyamssnanggong'phel said:
2.  They don't understand there is a difference between tantric Buddha Nature of Mahamudra and sutric Buddha Nature of Tathāgatagarbha Sutras.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, this point is confusing for many people. It is made more confusing when scholars like Longchenpa regularly invoke the Uttaratantra in order to introduce concepts in Dzogchen causing people to conflate sugatagarbha teachings as they appear in Dzogchen and sūtra.


nyamssnanggong'phel said:
3.  They don't understand tantra is higher than sutra.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, they can't be blamed for this since Sapan strongly argued against this position (indeed arguing against the position of his own guru, Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen). Since then, virtually all schools but Nyingma have maintained that the view of sutra and tantra is the same, differing only in means.

Malcolm, I happen to be reading "Gateway to Knowledge" volume 4, and maybe we could discuss the passage beginning on p.33 in the "Nirvana Is Peace" section as follows: Even more than that, by having discarded all the passing stains from
the cognizant nature  of  mind, it becomes the identity  of  great natural
purity, the ultimate transformation  of  fully perfected abandonment
and realization, the dharmakaya, [the body  of  buddha qualities] This
has coundess qualities,  but  to summarize, these are transcendent pu-
rity,  bliss, permanence  and  identity.
I'm assuming you have access to it, and the Tibetan is facing it. The "transcendent identity" mentioned above is "bdag gi pha rol tu phyin pa" in the Tibetan for example.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, perfection of identity, described in the Uttaratantra as being beyond self and non-self:

Having purified the proliferation of self and non-self
Since [the proliferation] is completely pacified, it is the highest self.

But, you have to realize that reality has been described already in the Uttaratantra as free from all extremes of proliferation. The dharmakāya is defined as the wisdom of Jinas, which is course is why it cannot be seen even by tenth stage bodhisattvas since they still possess a thin veil of the knowledge obscuration.

Here, that which is being described as the nature of the mind, the mind essence, is what Mipham is describing.

As far as Buddha qualities go -- it is appalling funny to see grown men arguing over whether the Buddha's penis withdrawn into a pouch ultimately exists.

I didn't say only, I said "can", it really depends on what you are defining as Dharmakāya -- and there are many ways to look at the issue.

Madhyamakas have one approach; Yogacara's a different approach and so on.

Why don't you provide us with a definition for Dharmakāya and we can start from there?

How about the ārya-dharmasaṃgīti-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

"dharmakāya is the nirvana of the tathagatā".

Or ārya-trikāya-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra

"dharmakāya means the absence of inherent existence like space"

Or the parinirvāṇasūtra:

"Without having exhausted afflictions, dharmakāya always exists"

These three statements for example can be seen as non-contradictory in the following way:

The Buddha realized nirvana; nirvana is the dharmakāya; dharmakāya is the absence of inherent existence, the absence of inherent existence, i.e. dharmakāya is a permanent fact of reality.

Here, we have an example of asserting the dharmakāya as permanent without asserting that it is something which exists, like the Hindu notion of self.

The problem as I see is that you take literally that which should be understood to be intentional or provisional.

Of course it is exactly that; just as the potential for butter exists in milk, so too the potential for awakening exist in sentient beings. That potential is called "tathāgatagarbha". When that potential is "churned:" by practice, the result emerges just as butter emerges from milk. But if you examine milk before it has been churned you certainly will not find butter there. Likewise, if you examine sentient beings for buddha qualities you also will not find them, even though since they will arise through practice we can consider them naturally complete at the time of the cause.

Anyway, I am not sure why you are upset at being termed "eternalist" since that is exactly what your beliefs are, i.e., eternalist. You believe in the existence of something that is permanent as well as primeval.

The passage you cite merely states there is a state of bondage and a state of liberation. It does not state that liberation exists without the context of bondage. In fact, it predicates liberation on the fact of bondage.

It really does not say anything more than nirvana means freedom from rebirth.

The only reason you are using a Pali canon citation is that you know that Mahāyāna sūtras are not defensible as historical records of the Buddha.

Instead of giving citations, you should exercise your intellect, which is much better than becoming an expert in this or that species of dogmatics.

TRUNGPA RINPOCHE:  (...) Commitment to your guru and his teachings is very necessary; it gives you some guidelines for your life.  Without that commitment you might begin to make up your own version of the Dharma, your own edition of the teachings, and sooner or later what you will get back is just your own ego version of the teachings.  So the idea of commitment here is total surrendering, complete surrendering.  You don't edit your own version of the Dharma anymore.

I let my egoic mind get out of control earlier this year after receiving a deity initiation from a high Sakya lama (just the wang) that didn't have an associated practice text to go along with it (besides the short daily prayer sheet that was handed out), and I was intensely googling and bugging the lamas and monastery about if there was a more complete sadhana available for study / practice to no avail. It didn't make sense to me, why would there be an empowerment (and it wasn't an obscure one) without a practice sadhana?!? A few weeks ago I randomly found a copy at the monastery store and eagerly snatched it up before I realized that it was (a) really long, (b) really complex, (c) not a daily practice , and (d) a returned copy with some confused notes scribbled in the margins from someone who was probably in my exact state of mind a few weeks earlier.

By and large, no one anymore believes Mahāyāna sutras were taught by the Buddha and there are many good reasons to reject that belief. Frankly, my point of view is that imagining Indic origins for the Dzogchen tantras inhibits our ability to understand them.

The problem is that people conflate the issue of origin with the issue of value. For me, the origin of these texts is not what grants them value; but the schemes people have elaborated to understand on the basis of their origin are no more effective than believing that scheme of the three turnings of the wheel grants us definitive insight in the meaning of Buddhist teachings.

What grants these texts value for me is the various ways they describe the process of delusion and how to wake up from that.

Since Tibetans like JIgme Lingpa consider the whole of Dzogchen literature as a monolithic textual edifice imported from India rather than a gradual discourse among the developed in Tibet beginning in the early ninth century, they tend to assert dogmatically formulations which derive from man ngag sde and apply them rather indiscriminately. We should be careful not to do the same. Otherwise, we will never understand Dzogchen fully.

But this picture is fundamentally dualistic to begin with, because it starts with a separation of the consciousness that is or is not recognizing from that which is or is not recognized. If this separation is removed, then dualism vanishes of itself, and its called Dzogchen. This state is not created by recognition, is not lost by non-recognition: it is always already the case.

Malcolm wrote:
The interesting feature of Dzogchen is not the basis. The interesting feature of Dzogchen is its explanation of delusion.

You can keep claiming potatoes are the basis I(no need to even call them "appearances of the basis) until the cows come home. This does not help one to understand the process of delusion at all. Fundamentally, Dzogchen teachings serve to explain the process of delusion and how to unravel it.

I agree with you that the basis not improved by recognition or rendered defective by non-recognition. I also agree with you that delusion never stirs from the state of the basis itself. However, this does not mean that cognition of a potato is a cognition of the basis. It is a cognition of the all-basis.

The cognition of conventional things is produced by consciousnesses impregnated with traces of delusion without beginning. The intellectual apprehension that delusion never stirs from the basis is still just an intellectual apprehension that does nothing in terms of unraveling the fundamental delusion the produces deluded experience in the first place.

This is why for example, it is clearly stated in various places that gazing at rocks and trees for example will not lead one to experience the body of light because unlike the wisdom appearances of the four visions, the vision of rocks and trees are karmic visions supported on traces of affliction and action, i.e. the dualism of deluded vision itself.

In order to see the basis as it is, rather than the deluded superimposition (samaropa) we normally perceive, we have to uproot the all-basis, the so called ālaya.

Incidentally, in the account of the appearance of the basis it is pretty clearly stated that the appearance of the basis is perceived with sense organs that arise from the basis along with the neutral awareness that stirs from the potentiality [rtsal] of the basis.

That primordial dualism [the connate ignorance, lhan cig skye ma rig pa] collapses when that neutral awareness recognizes the appearance of the basis as its own state; but when it does not, the imputing ignorance takes the name of the all-basis, producing all of our conventional, and therefore, innately deluded experience.

"or course, there is no other possibility."

Malcolm wrote:
Snake [false appearance of the all-basis], rope [appearance of the basis].

On the other hand without the appearance of the basis there is also no basis for deluded appearances, so I can see why you are confused. This is the principle reason why the man ngag sde school elaborated a gzhi and a kun gzhi to account for how it is that deluded appearances are not the appearance of the basis (which cannot itself give rise to deluded appearances), while demonstrating that deluded, i.e., conventional, (i.e. the false) appearances of everyday things are rooted in the nonrecognition of the basis.

In the bodhicitta texts no differentiation is made between gzhi and kun gzhi, since the concept of the appearance of the basis was not yet formulated.

If potatoes are the appearance of the basis, there is no need for the elaboration of the all-basis to account for deluded appearances.

I get that, but this still revolves around a 'view of the ultimate' model of liberation. If we take a 'shred of affliction' model as early Buddhism does (I think the former is really mostly useful for determining how practically useful a model is) for our measurement, it comes out to 'no-thing at all to hang a shred of clinging to' vs 'a few ontological shreds of clinging of a mostly purified mind'.

Dzogchen is predicated on dependent origination and emptiness, Advaita refutes both dependent origination and emptiness. The difference, as always, is view.

If you confine your notion of liberation to controlling afflictions, there there is no difference at all between all the various ethical systems which recommend self-control in conjunction with contemplative quietude.

The question here is whether or not the cessation of rebirth is effected by seeing dependent origination or by seeing an ontological totality. Take your pick and run with it. But you cannot pick both because they are mutually exclusive views.

One of the key points of the Dzogchen tradition is understanding all these different tīrthika [samsaric] and bauddha [nirvanic] tenet systems.

Samantabhadra also experiences liberation; doing so without gathering virtue; just as sentient beings experience bondage without gathering nonvirtue.

Please study Dzogchen more carefully. Even rdzogs chen tantras themselves differentiate Dzogchen from Advaita.

Malcolm wrote:
I simply pointed out to him that the structure of the gzhan stong presentation of the two truths could not be distinguished from the way Advaita formulates the two truths. He admitted this, but replied that Advaita did not have buddhahood and that was the difference between the two. In other words for him, the structural similarities in the formulations were of less consequence than differences in the notions of total liberation between the two systems.

But lets not extend the consequences of answer to far. He was not admitting for example, that there is only one universal cit, and so on, as in Advaita.

There is also the fact that idea of bodhicitta and so on is utterly lacking in tīrthika systems.

Tibetan texts give the Sanskrit in a much more accurate way than anything in Sino-Japanese Buddhism. This is simply a fact.

If a sadhana is listing things like faces, hands, etc., this should be translated in English and recited in English, irrespective of which tradition it comes from. The only exception would Shomyo chanting, etc., things like that.

Karmic debts are incurred only if the dana is not provided or received in such a manner. For example, Aryadeva gave his eye to a blind woman, but when she ate his proffered eye rather than using it to restore her sight, Aryadeva winced with regret at the gift. For this reason, it is said, his eye was not restored to him, as it would have been were he free from the three wheels.

Let us hope that however we exercise our generosity, we do so like wish fulfilling gems, effortlessly and without thought.

Malcolm wrote:
All kinds of things. Another thing I observed is that we in this culture, whether we were buddhists in pasts lives or not, have no tradition of punya-sambhara, merit accumulation, which is the rational which underlies 90 precedent of Buddhist ritual, irrespective of tradition. Because of this, we do not naturally reach for our wallets when we see monks and nuns. Instead, our model is a fee-for-service.

As I have noted elsewhere, I don't see anytime soon that there is going to be much sustainability in Buddhist organizations in the West.

For example, every school and every tradition and every sub-tradition wants it own space, etc. There is no sharing of space (because of course that requires also that people cooperate). One person shared with me their puzzlement at why one tulku wanted to place a center in a region where there was already a center that belonging to the same exact school and lineage. Or in Drikung, in Lincoln Vt., there are two Drikung Kagyu centers, and there used to be three (in a town of 1200 people). In Boston there were two. There is a huge impetus to build empires.

You have to understand that the model of governance in Buddhism culture is grounded on the model of the cakravartin, the wheel turning emperor whose golden wheel [there are four grades of wheels actually] conquers any land it rolls through peacefully. Well, every Tibetan school turns its leaders into just such emperors, at least on a symbolic level, and this leads to lots of unnecessary competition and a lot of unsustainable development. It also, in the past, has lead to internecine warfare in Tibet.

All of this is totally built into Tibetan culture at this point and as proof, we have the so-called "Kingdom of Shambhala" in Halifax, Nova Scotia, complete with a king and royal family, a court, an army and a grand narrative borrowed from the Kalacakra cycle. All of this, is deeply cultural. Of course we can make the observation that Karma Dorje does and assert that it is based on one's traces, and for us this is true. But it is not a sufficient explanation.

Depends. Recently I was chatting with a lama who was complaining that westerners never make offerings for prayers and so on, while the Chinese and so on do.

He generally feels that it is because of a lack of faith on the part of Westerners. I responded that no, it is not due to a lack of faith, I pointed out that here especially in US where we have a strong tradition of separation of Church and State as well as strong Protestant traditions, that people tended to regard organized religion with suspicion, not because they have no faith, but because they regard organized religion as being corrupted by power and money. Also we have no cultural tradition of hiring priests to come and recite rituals, unless you are Catholic. Basically, what I was pointing out to him that most of this discomfort is grounded in sociological and historical reasons. I suspect that in Tibet, much of the competition revolved around getting people to recite your prayers, not the other guy's.

I`m just trying to understand , I`m not criticizing here, but my teachers from Karma Kagyu, Sakya and Ningma traditions always taught me, that for any tantric practice, taking formal Refuge ceremony is indispensable. So, for instance, when they give initiation, they will always make sure that new people can take Refuge before initiation...So could you please explain that to me ?


Malcolm wrote:
Every initiation has a refuge ceremony, as well as a bodhisattva vow ceremony built right into it. So it is completely unnecessary to insist that people take refuge and bodhisattva vows according to their respective systems of conferring vows. It simply isn't necessary.

Their attitude come from the traditional Buddhist custom of "cutting the hair". For them, it marks one's serious commitment to the path -- this is why these kinds of traditional teachers are likely to insist that one has to have had a formal and separate refuge ceremony. Even so, it is not necessary.

You are misunderstanding a key point -- you have to consecrate all of your food because of all the sentient beings who died in its production, not merely meat, but every grain of rice you eat caused the death of something from field to table.

It is a global principle.

You can imagine you are "pure" because you are not eating meat, but you are not. You can imagine you are "compassionate" because you are not eating meat, but if you have no method to help all the beings who are connected to you through debt incurred through eating food, again, your compassion is "miserable", meaning lacking in depth.

Also "praying" for animals is fine, but a little useless since animals pass through the bardo very rapidly, you need another way to connect with them, another way of creating dependency.

Humans can understand humans when they are in the bardo, therefore, reciting prayers and texts like Bardo Thödral can be very effective. Even here however, this is really only useful a) for practitioners b) must be recited in language the deceased will understand. There are other prayers that are useful for non-practitioners.

In any event, I think it is important for people to study and receive a lot of things, rather than get stuck in these Tibetan lineage politics. Even if they spend some time in a state of confusion, life is short, teachings are rare, and deciding not to go to a teaching because "it might be bad for me" is really false thinking. If you are interested in tummo, go find a tummo teacher. If you are interested in Dzogchen, go find a Dzogchen teacher.

Teachers really cannot discern your capacity unless they have known you for years.

Of course, once you have perceived the essence of all teachings, then going to teachers is a waste of time unless you have a very specific reason for wanting this or that teaching.

These seem to me excellent points, something everyone can participate in -- the "who is wasting what" and the consequences of all that waste. Instead of proscribing that everyone must eat one way or another, pay attention to what is wasted and to increased efficiencies by not wasting so much food. A middle way of sorts that leaves no one out.

On a personal note, I knew there was a lot of wasting of food in the US as I've worked in the past as a waiter and in catering. But 1.3 billion tons of food wasted in 2011? I had to go look that up.

And I still don't get that logic. Just because it's happening anyway, doesn't mean we have to participate. Sorry to keep referencing my previous post, but I only see how that works if people apply the same to other industries:
There was a point in time where slavery was thought to be inevitable and worldwide. Do you think the people had no karmic consequences if they bought slaves that were already captured, not by their request?
What about with the recent revealing of Seaworld's cruelty. If someone knows what they do to those whales, but still pays seaworld money to go watch them, is that okay because they have the assumption it won't ever change?

If someone explains that those are the same as eating meat, then I would understand. It's really only the separation, people saying one is okay karmically and not the other that I still don't really understand.

Malcolm wrote:
Owning a person is different than eating a the flesh of a dead animal.

One can eat meat without participating in industrial agriculture.

There are two issues in your post:

1. Ethics of eating meat
2. The karmic consequences of eating meat.

The Buddhist ethical positions have been laid out already. The majority of people who are opposing the issue of eating meat are not doing so on the basis of a strictly Buddhist position.

As for karma, karma requires intention, an object, the deed, and satisfaction that the deed was done.

No Buddhist who eats meat will satisfy the criteria for creating a perfect karma of killing. No Buddhist is happy that animals are killed for food. We all regret it.

Even if we refuse to buy meat, still animals will be killed for food. The production of organic food on a national ands global scale requires the animal husbandry industry, especially for poultry litter, feather meal, bone meal, blood meal and other such organic fertilizers.

But this issue goes way beyond what Buddhists may or may not do,

A friend of mine whose father runs the largest organic produce farm in Bakersville, CA., was heard to remark that there is not enough chicken shit to produce organic food on a national scale.

Frankly, the real problem is the majority of people who live in cities who do not participate in the production of their own food, people who have no idea how their food is grown, where, and so on.

Our nation throws away an astonishing amount of food everyday, to the tune of 40%-50% of all the food we produce.

IN 2011, 1.3 bilion tons of food was discarded. This represents a third of global food production. The amount of food wasted per US citizen is 240 lbs per year.

Absolutely wrong. For example, I know of no Buddhist who eats meat who would eat a lobster in a lobster house because they are killed on the spot for the client.

Granted, because of our economy, meat is cheaper and more available than it was a hundred years ago, when people tended to eat meat seasonally. Chicken and pork were more expensive because they depend on grain for feed (cows should not be fed corn for any reason because they cannot digest it properly).

But this has nothing to do with the basic point that in Vajrayāna there is very clearly a tradition, like it or not, of consuming meat, mostly bovine, and combining that with a method to assist the sentient being that was connected with that flesh at one point.

But, did he really? It seems like people believe it was added later by Mahayana buddhists who did not appreciate the meat-eating of Theravadins. Seems pretty odd that by Theravadin texts, the Buddha specifically did not make a rule against it, then with Mahayana he did and then with Vajrayana meat is back again. No sir, I don't buy it.

Malcolm wrote:
Note: I said the Buddha in Mahāyāna sūtras.

Not asking anyone to buy anything. But it is beyond doubt that the Buddha did harshly criticize meat eating in Mahāyāna sūtras.

Whether you accept that Buddha actually taught these sūtras or not is an entirely different question.

Since I consider myself a Mahāyānist, I accept the general message of Mahāyāna.

Since I am a Vajrayānist, I practice according to my understanding of the texts, without being overly concerned about their supposed historical provenance.

Malcolm, sorry if you've talked about this before, but what is the take of Tibetan medicine on meat?


Malcolm wrote:
Tibetan medicine as well as Ayurveda include meat for those with certain conditions that benefit from meat.

One's diet should be based on one's constitution. One should eat in healthy balanced manner, consistent with the one's health and the customs of the land you live in.

BTW, when Norbu Rinpoche says that being a vegetarian is "miserable" compassion, he is primarily referring to Vajrayāna Buddhists who advocate vegetarianism. Why? Because there are methods in Vajrayāna which assist the animals in question achieve liberation who are connected with the production of our food, whether they are destroyed through pesticides and cultivation or through slaughter. Thus, even if one is a vegetarian one may not justify one's choice not to eat meat through resort of arguments of compassion  since one is leaving behind animals who are slaughtered for meat.

He also makes it very clear that the writings on vegetarianism by Shabkar and so on are direct towards common people who are not real Vajrayāna practitioners. Since they have no method and no understanding it is much better that they not eat meat. Also the Buddha taught in Mahāyāna sutra that we mustn't eat meat.

There is currently in place a system for upgrading a lama's status to "rinpoche" that is, at least in theory, based on merit, without the designation of tulku being attached. The fact that there has been extreme inflationary pressure for various titles (how many "His Holinesses" are there now?), which cheapens the credibility of the entire system of titles, is a sad and seemingly unavoidable comment on our times.

In terms of tulkus there is the functional consideration of choosing which person to put on the fast-track of practice, including possible material support and access to teachers, so some choice should be made early on. Actual public recognition should wait until if and when the results of the practices are stabilized, probably no earlier than the candidate's mid-30s. That should cut down on the percentage of embarrassing train wrecks.

But that's not going to happen. Nobody is in charge to make those types of decisions. The situation will evolve however it will.

Malcolm wrote:
My view on the subject is that the terma system and the tulku system both will continue to meet the needs of the client population for these phenomena, mainly Tibetans.

The terma system offers Nyingmapas the assurance that the blessings of their system of teachings never declines and the tulku system in general offers the Tibetan population as a whole, as well as some westerners, the assurance that they will always be guided by buddhas. These are powerful motivations propelling the furtherance of both traditions.

Whether they will be very relevant to us is another question.

We do not have a cultural identity wrapped up in a mythos of a golden imperial era with emanated bodhisattvas benevolently carrying out the duties of an enlightened monarch, working in concert with a foreign wizard and aiding the spread of the dharma, concealing teachings for such times when there are threats to the nation. In general, these are the terms under which termas are concealed and revealed in the Padmasambhava tradition. As a westerner, one has to be educated into these concepts, concepts which are the running background of Tibetan society in general.

As for the tulku system, the tulku system will continue, but I predict that in the West, most tulku recognitions of practitioners will be post-mortem, as it was before the Karmapas.

Malcolm wrote:
Which century are you talking about? This is certainly not the case with writers like Davidson and so on.

The notion of the evolution of Mahāyāna Buddhism and then Vajrayāna is based on text critical research.

What is more amusing about your assertion is that classical Indian Buddhist historians of the eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh century take great pains explain why there is a sudden appearance Vajrayāna in India concocting all kinds of wild schemes from Vajrasattva in an iron tower in South India (Amoghavajra and Co in China) to the account of King Dza (Nyingma, but based on Indian antecedents) to the Sakya accounts found in 12th century Presentation of the General Divisions of Tantra, not to mention the earlier and well known account of the recovery of Prajñāpāramita from the Nāgā kingdom under the ocean by Nāgārjuna.

You see, Indians themselves acknowledged from an early period in the common era that Mahāyāna also "suddenly appeared".

Text critical scholars like Davidson, etc., are trying to work out the evolution of these texts because they were pointed to in that direction by what the texts and classical commentaries themselves reveal about the origins of these later canons.

It is just too ungenerous to modern scholars like Gregory Schopen and so on to accuse them of some strange Christian biases.

BTW, the first victim of Christian text critical scholarship was the bible itself.

But text critical scholarship, while not the end all and be all of interpretation of what these texts mean, is very useful in understanding where these texts come from. But sadly, people conflate the two, assuming that if some scholar is correct about say, the Chinese origins of the Heart sutra (Nattier's theory), that therefore, somehow the Heart Sutra becomes less meaningful as a protective charm against non-humans.

The problem is that Western people of a fundamentalist bent shy away from taking text critical scholarship seriously precisely because of our cultural tendency to interpret texts teleologically (which is a Christian, indeed a very western trait inherited from Plato, etc.), a tendency we have deeply inherited from the generally Hegelian theory of history (into which Tibetan narratives predicated on the role of the Imperial period personalities like Padmasambhava and so on play nicely) that we follow.

So when we are confronted with early narratives like that in the 'Bum nag, the sBa bzhed, etc., where Padmasambhava has a human father and mother, we reject these in favor of wildly contradictory later accounts of Padmasamabhava's life story because our teachers don't like the idea that Padmasambhava had a human father and mother.

In the end, there are certain Buddhist trends and narratives, especially in Vajrayāna, that play very nicely into our very Western habit of fundamentalism in thought and deed.

This is ironic, because Mahāyāna teachings often completely deconstruct so called Hinayāna teachings, just as Vajrayāna deconstructs the Mahāyāna path and Dzogchen deconstructs Vajrayāna.

We have all these Buddhist teachings deconstructing each other, and yet we have all these Buddhists, both Asian and Western, hell-bent on keeping the whole thing bound together with spit, twine and duct tape. Honestly, it is pretty funny to me.

In terms of Dharma practice that fundamental fear is not the problem. It is assumed by Dharma to be the initial operating spiritual principal in the individual. That is why the initial teachings traditionally are about the hell realms, etc. If people have fears, then direct those fears productively and bring them to Dharma. But at some point those fears need to connect to Dharma and need to begin to resolve, which is the stage of "Refuge". Our fears need to begin to be resolved into belief and trust, or as is said more traditionally faith and devotion. At the end of the path there are no more fears, and one of the epithets for buddhahood is "The Great Fearlessness". My late teacher was heard to say, "All fully revealed religions start with fear and end with love. Why? Because fear is the initial spiritual condition of all men, and love the ultimate spiritual condition of all men."

On the other hand, existential nihilism, coupled with a society in flux, families in disarray, creates frightened people that cannot trust and have no faith. This is the disadvantage we have in our practices. This is what no lama can ever conceive of, since their worldview cannot allow for it. It is our blind spot that we insist not be disturbed because when our own religion collapsed we rejected all religion, not just our religion.

Sorry, that is not where my path has lead me. It has lead me to unconditional confidence, knowledge and personal experience. I don't really respond well to the trust, faith and devotion thing.

The Buddha taught that we suffer from birth, aging, sickness and death. He taught us how to escape that condition. Later humans elaborated on the Buddha's message and taught the deeper meaning underlying it (i.e. emptiness of inherent existence). Still other humans later on decided that was too extreme and decided that the deeper meaning needed to be augmented by a somewhat more positive message about our condition, and taught tathāgatagarbha. None of this however renders the universe meaningful.

As I have said many times here and elsewhere. "Life has no meaning, but if you are a Dharma practitioner, then life is meaningful." But this is not a declaration of a teleological ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology ) meaningfulness of the kind you are expressing here. It is also not a declaration of absolute meaningfulness. It is a strictly relative meaningfulness relevant only to humans who can think and judge. It is not a statement about the value of the universe or even the value of a spotted owl. Spotted owls are meaningful to me personally, but they are not ultimately meaningful in anyway.

The universe will perish. Generally speaking we are taught in the Dharma not to impute meaning on the impermanent, the afflicted and identityless. Since even nirvana is identityless, it is a little risky for Dharma practitioners to invest much meaning in it.

The absence of illness is health.
The absence of suffering is bliss.
The absence of meaning is freedom.

Yes, the Pali suttas are rather dry. One of the reasons is that they are NOT literary compositions. They reflect the extemporaneous speech of the Buddha. The themes covered are limited, oft repeated and formulaic.

Let me give an example. You can listen to any DC webcast. I guarantee you that on the first day Norbu Rinpoche will say x, y and z. He often states these things in virtually identical phrases. The Pali canon is like that -- it is an oral record of what the historical Buddha actually said.

Mahāyāna sutras are often quite interesting, because they are literary compositions intended for audiences with specific religious goals in mind. They sometimes emulate repetition, but they are not mnemonically repetitive in same way that Pali suttas are.  Thus, they should not be confused with what the historical Buddha said.

The Mahāyāna Buddha is not a historical buddha by any accepted standard of historiography. Chogyal Namkhai Norbu writes on the birth date of sTon pa Shen rab: "...and since history must be studied in congruence with ordinary human perception, I prefer not to base myself on these traditions" (Drung, Deu and Bon, pg. 156). I suggest we should apply no less a rigorous standard to the study of all Buddhist texts and traditions than we do to the study of Bon and other religious traditions, and also judge them in concert with ordinary human perception.

Whatever the Buddha of Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna may mean to us personally is not relevant to what we can know about Mahāyāna sūtras through careful text critical study and archaeological finds and it is better to keep the two separate. I understand that in some people this creates a cognitive dissonance, and they feel they have to choose one or the other. I don't have that problem -- who knows, maybe it is a result of practicing years of creation stage.

The universe is not a cold mechanistic place, and life is full of meaning. And even an illiterate tibetan villager knows it.

Malcolm wrote:
The universe is a cold place. We seek comfort in our religions, politics, and so on, much like ants seek comfort in ant hills, more or less completely unaware of anything external to their world unless it threatens them.

If there is meaning to life, as I said above, it is only because that meaning is imputed upon it. Even attaining buddhahood is in reality meaningless. Even saving sentient beings is meaningless. If you want it to have meaning, that's ok. But in the end, when we are all dead and buried (within the next 20-60 years) most of us will not even be remembered. We will not remember our past life. We will not remember having decided to follow Buddhadharma. Some of us might no even be human beings anymore.

We are indeed free of teleological meaningfulness. I prefer to leave such concepts to Hegel and his lot.

I must say that I am totally shocked to hear self-described Mahayanists saying that life (including the bodhisattva motivation) has no meaning, and that ceasing to exist entirely (not just within samsara) is the ultimate aim.

Malcolm wrote:
One does not cease to exist (ucchedavada); however with the absence of the cause for arising there is cessation.

Life does not need to have any meaning for a bodhisattva (who understands the meaninglessness of life) to wish to free sentient beings from pointless rounds of samsaric existence. In fact it entirely underpins their whole motivation. They have recognized that there is no meaning to life, and they wish to rescue others from the delusion that life has meaning.

The point of Buddhadharma is to cease having the experience of birth, aging, sickness and death.

As Maitreya Bodhisattva is supposed to have said, there is not even the a needle point of happiness to be found samsara. Birth only occurs because of afflictions. When afflictions are eradicated, birth also ceases.

However, the meaningless of life does not prevent me from enjoying life. I actually rather enjoy it more, since I know that my existence is free from the burden of teleological meaningfulness.

I am not sure what you mean by "wisdom". So you mean omniscience? Or do you mean prajñā?

If the former, omniscience is not required for liberation.

If the latter, the prajñā that eradicates the afflictions is exactly the same in an arhat and a buddha.

Sherab said:
Okay, let me try again and see if I can make my trend of thought a little clearer.

I was thinking along the line that the liberation of an arhat is liberation from the 12 links of dependent origination.  This is done when any link is cut.  That cutting is due to a certain wisdom realized.

Since the wisdom of a buddha is far greater than the wisdom of an arhat, there must be a difference in the realization of a buddha compared to an arhat.

This implies that the wisdom realized by a buddha goes further than just cutting the 12 links of dependent origination.  It is the difference in knowledge/wisdom of a buddha compared to an arhat that allows the buddha to perform greater 'miraculous' feats than an arhat.  So I thought that the difference would come from the buddha having knowledge of all dependencies and not just those of the 12 links of DO.  Via the buddha's knowledge/wisdom of all dependencies, the liberation of the buddha is liberation from all dependencies, in contrast to the liberation of an arhat which is only a liberation from the 12 links of DO.

Feel free to point me to your sources Malcolm. After almost 30 years listening to Buddhist teachings I find it very probable the Buddha taught in different ways to different disciples. The fact that they find it difficult to find proof that Hinayana is older than Mahayana is an interesting indication of that.

Malcolm wrote:
You are confusing two different factors: Physical texts with age of a given tradition.

The early Canon was largely oral. We know that by the time of Ashoka texts were starting to be written down.

There is no record of an early reaction to Mahāyāna, as you would suppose there would be, since Ashoka purged the monastic sangha at the encouragement of the Vibhajyavadins. You see reactions towards proto Mahayāna ideas such as multiplicity of Buddhas and so on. But the first solid historical evidence we have of Mahāyāna texts is their translation into Chinese, and now a few fragments from Gandhara which support the idea that Mahāyāna was current in the Gandhara region during the first century.

We have Buddhist texts written on Ashoka pillars that can be pinpointed and have been. We know that the Pali canon was written down in Shri Lanka during at the beginning of the first century BCE. We know that there were muliple canons. We also know that in Mahāyāna sūtras books are mentioned a lot. In the Pali sūtras, books are never mentioned even once. Clearly, the primary difference between the Nikāyas and the Mahāyāna canon is the difference between collection of texts that were recalled orally for centuries prior to being committed to writing to a collection of texts that are a product of a self-concious literary process of authorship.

Renunciation is regarded as an aspect of the sutric paths, but nowhere else does it seems to be regarded as the essence or summary.

Are there other, earlier sources that regard renunciation as the essence of the Sutric path? Or is this characterization ChNNR's specific teaching?

The idea of the evolution of Buddhist spiritual practice in Indian history is based on very solid evidence, inscriptions, statues, etc. There is lot of plastic evidence that tracks to evolution of Mahāyāna into Vajrayāna for example aside from texts.

Irrespective of its historical origins: Mahāyāna is valid on its own terms or it is not. I accept that it is. Bodhicitta is a unique contribution of Mahāyāna to world spiritual traditions. I fully identify as a practitioner of Mahāyāna Dharma. I understand the desire and wish to trace this sūtra or that sūtra back to Shakyamuni Buddha, but I think it is futile.

In order for me to be convinced that Mahāyāna was taught by anyone, let alone the Buddha, prior to the first century BCE, I would need to see some hard physical facts. Luckily for me, my soteriology does not depend on archaeology. Also my estimation of the capacity of Tibetans (or anyone else) to understand nonduality as presented in Buddhist texts does not depend on whether Buddha actually taught "nonduality".

[...] I've been talking with a lot of--a few, a few scholars in Oxford. They're very good, really good! Very good. There are many so-called Buddhist professors, or Buddhist experts, and they strongly oppose reincarnation. They don't believe that nonduality is taught by the Buddha, and stuff like that. Very good. It's a very educational for me. [smiles, audience laughs] I would just yesterday talked about--someone I had actually only heard the name, but never really learned anything about...him. Um, Karl...Karl Popper. Karl Popper? So... Also, in Oxford I was told that they're studying Buddhism "objectively." That's very interesting. [smiles, audience laughs] So this is all disorienting for me because [stammers] I had to switch my mind back to the Buddhist mind, so to speak, in order to talk about... this.

Anyway this is very important subject. [long pause] If we don't talk about nonduality, then I don't think we can really talk about Buddhism at all. And nonduality's not so easy. Recently I was talking to...Indians, just Indian intellectuals. And I was even kind of... worried...that how much we Tibetans actually manage to conceive the idea of nonduality thoroughly, as much as these Indians seems to have done. It's not that easy, this nonduality, to really conceive this.  Especially if are, you think like, I think, like Karl Popper's way. And if you really think that something can be observed and valued objectively, nonduality's difficult. [shifts on seat] About a year ago I met a professor in America--Berkeley University--and he told me something very interesting. He said actually, it's very important that the Tibetan lamas know the history of Buddhism, and especially the history of Buddhism in the West.  And he said especially in America because, he said, that the emergence of Buddhism in the West may be, may have...it started, you know, it started with a very Descartes-like Buddhism. So it's a very dualistic Buddhism, so to speak. I can understand him, because even the most seasoned dharma practitioner in the West sometimes I do have doubt, how much they are really understanding. Of course we are not talking about actual realization of nonduality, but we are talking about intellectual understanding of nonduality. Because the concept is just not proveable. Because every logic, language, method of measurement, is dualistic. So dualistic method cannot measure and value something nondualistic. Always! And anything that cannot be proved, or anything that does not have a "manufacturing date," so to speak, I think in the materialistic world, modern world, it's all not really...it's a [struggle?], it's like a [struggle?], it really doesn't have much value in it.

This quote presents a false argument, one that is is very superficial.

DKR goes from the premise that because Buddhologists in general do not accept the idea that Mahāyāna was historically taught by the Buddha (in other words, texts were composed that used the persona of the Buddha as a mouthpiece for various Mahāyāna doctrines) that they, indeed all Westerners, therefore are under suspicion of being incapable of understanding the nondual message taught in those texts.

His argument is at base a species of cultural chauvinism. This cultural chauvinism that DKR frequently expresses in his lectures is distressingly blind.

In sum, he starts with an issue of historiography and ends up leveling a charge of philosophical incompetence. DKR has a bad attitude about westerners. Its a pity really.

The term enlightened is too broad to be meaningful in the context of Buddhadharma. Further, there is actually no term in all of Buddhadharma which corresponds to the English words "enlightened" or "spiritually illuminated".

Tantric Buddhism was more systematically introduced into China before it was into Tibet it seems.

It seems the Chinese tradition preserved earlier developments more than the Tibetans did. This is the opinion of some Japanese scholars which classify Shingon/Zhenyan as 'middle period' esoteric Buddhism, while Tibetan is generally more associated with a 'later period'.

Malcolm wrote:

Vajrayāna was introduced some thirty years (or earlier) later into Tibet by a large number of masters. After all, Samye was completed by 779 at the latest on a Vajrayāna plan. This means that Padmasambhava was present in Tibet not later than 775. This is a mere 34 years after Amoghavajra returned from his travels in 746.

When we examine these claims purely on the basis of historical dates, the claim that Vajrayāna in China is significantly "earlier" than Tibetan Imperial period Vajrayāna seems to be vastly overstated. Further, the unrestricted translation of so called anuttarayoga texts in Tibet was actually forbidden by royal edict and the main practices of the imperial period at Samye were grounded in Tattvasamgraha and the Vajrasikhara, just as in China and in Japan (from 804 onwards). Practices such as Vajrakilaya, which do date to that period, were very secret and not public at all.

BTW, Jeff, you consistently say that Vajrayāna in China was "earlier" than that in Tibet. But this is not really true.

Vajrayāna was brought to Tibet during the reign of khri srong lde'u btsan which lasted from 755 to 797 or 804 depending on whose account you follow. Amoghavajra only translated a portion of the Tattvasamgraha into Chinese in 754, thought he translated a number of other texts. Considering that it is very likely that the yoga tantra, etc., we see comes from South India by way of Java and so on, both by tradition and by textual evidence, and the so called annutaratyoga tantras such as Guhysamaja are sited in Oḍḍiyāna from the start, this accounts for the very different characters of Tibetan and Chinese Vajrayāna traditions, not "earlier" and "later" since Guhyasamaja and so on were certainly circulation by early 700's. Be that as it may, the main shrine in Samyas was devoted to the Vajradhātu Maṇḍala pointing to the presence of Tattvasamgraha by 790 at the latest in Tibet. sarvadurgatipariśodhanatejorājāyatathāgatasyārhatesamyaksambuddhasyakalpa-nāma, guhyasamaja, and so on are present in the ldan dkar catalogue pointing to its early presence in Tibet. Anyway, the Tattvasamgraha was never completely translated in Chinese until the 11th century, or perhaps the late tenth, around the same time it was translated into Tibetan.

Lama Ivo has already told his side of the story in some detail on his website, so before asking him to comment, it might be better to read that first. I was actually hoping to learn what other people say about him, in the hopes that that would prove revealing.

So far my impression (from reading his website) has been mixed. On one hand, he seems serious, intense, and knowledgable. I can hardly fault him for being a Westerner, or an iconoclast. On the other, he has obviously groomed his followers to obey him with some intensity, even when he guides them in unexpected directions. This model of guru-dom is one which I wish could be reformed out of Vajrayana, not simply universalized to make it less Tibetan. But then, I am an unenlightened wretch, so what do I know?

In the internalised trikaya model, as you said, the three are explained separately but they are not actually three different things. There are a number of ways to explain that. The simplest is the statement of the third "kaya" that emptiness and clarity are inseparable; here it is understood that clarity includes all appearances, it is dependent origination.

But you did not comment on this:
And since, in a non-dual state, the experiencer is the experienced, the experiencer must also be an illusion. So we could all be merely part of a computer simulation such as The Matrix and the Buddha is part of that as well.  Or the Hindu belief that we are all the dream of the God Brahma is correct and Buddha is also part of the dream.

And that would be a problem.
The fact that you did not comment on the above is to me, a reflection of the difficulty of avoiding the extremes of unconditioned and conditioned, and by extension the extreme position of the other mutually exclusive pairs such as permanent and impermanent, existence and non-existence etc. by using those very words, ie. words such as conditioned and unconditioned etc.

Malcolm wrote:
It depends on what you mean by nondual. There are three kinds of non dualism. One is cognitive non dualism, i.e., everything is consciousness, for, like example Yogacara. The second is ontological nondualism, i.e. everything is brahman, god, etc. The third is epistemic nondualism, i.e., being, non-being and so on cannot be found on analysis and therefore do not ultimately exist.

The indivisibility of the conditioned and the unconditioned is based on the third. We have only experience of conditioned phenomena. Unconditioned phenomena like space are known purely through inference since they have no characteristics of their own to speak of. When we analyze phenomena, what do we discover? We discover suchness, an unconditioned state, the state free from extremes. That unconditioned state cannot be discovered apart from conditioned phenomena, therefore, we can say with confidence that the conditioned and the unconditioned are nondual. The trick is which version of nonduality you are invoking. This nonduality of the conditioned and unconditioned cannot apply to the first two nondualities for various reasons.

Per 3rd Karmapa's Mahamudra prayer, Mind does not "exist." But Mind cannot be said to be "nonexistent."   This is Tantra, but let's forget that distinction for the moment.  I think you can find plenty of Sutra and Shastra sources regarding Mind, or perhaps Mere Awareness.  Consciousness at it's most basic level.   A "Knowing."

I think this is the sort of thing that some folks equate with the "Great Self," though my readings thus far have made it clear to me that using "self" is a bit of a misnomer, and leads to a variety of problems, many of which are outlined here on this thread.

Well, a major difference too was that in Tibet there was already a strong ritualist class that took to the imported Indian rituals like ducks to water. These ritualists performed vital economic functions in the Tibetan economy such as warding off rain, hail, ensuring harvests and calves, etc., exorcising spirits connected with contagious illnesses, herbalism and so on. On the other hand, Monastics in Tibet had little to offer the lay population, since their main function was conducting state rites just like the kind of early Vajrayāna we see about the same time in Japan and China. When the monastic establishment failed in Central Tibet in the 840's, during the Asian economic downturn of the late Tang, the Buddhist ritualists in Tibet continued to provide valued services to the local populations. It was only after the monastic establishment began to integrate these local services and allied themselves with the aristocratic families like the Khon during the 11th century and so on that the populace really began to lend wholesale support to monastic establishment.

This is precisely the argument used in Tibetan history for the existence of sngags pas.When monks fled the chaos that ensued after Langdarma was assassinated for proposing to tax the monasteries, Buddhadharma primarily survived due to the interest of aristocratic Clans such as the Khon and so on in preserving Buddhist teachings within their families.

After China's economy stabilized in the late tenth century, and trade between Tibet and China was no longer so disrupted, then the monastic community who had survived the travails of that epoch returned to Central Tibet and reestablished monasteries, encouraged by royal support.

The other factor too is that in Tibet, sngags pas are not really considered "lay" in the sense understood here in the West. They have undergone a kind of ordination, They have vows that are distinct from monastic vows, they also have garb to wear, etc. They are educated, which sets them apart from the average person and so on.

Basically, the problem as I see it is that line of reasoning employed by Ardent (Koji), VidyArAja, and so on is that unconditioned and conditioned phenomena are mutually exclusive.

For them the unconditioned is Self even if they cannot precisely say what that Self is (and they never seem to be able to).

Vidyārāja sees this self as the one who is aware (since he keeps asking who or what is aware of emptiness) -- this is very similar to the Samkhya based metaphysics of all the Hindu systems.

Ardent romantically sees the skandas as a mara (though how Ardent live with himself with such a negative view of his psychosomatic continuum is anyone's guess).

In other words, their view is very Manichaen, since they are addicted to an absolute dichotomy between the conditioned and unconditioned or Gnostic, in the sense that the material universe is evil and they are seekers of metanoia so they may return to the pleroma.

But sat does not mean existent.  Gaudapada was well acquainted with the tetralemma.

The reality of the matter is that ALL systems that posit a non-dual reality that is merely covered over by prapanca are just different philosophical franchises serving up the same tasty patties of ground beef and batons of deep-fried potato, whether on the one hand the cipher used is "emptiness" or on the other hand "Brahman".  Their various brands, trademarks, hermeneutical approaches and excuses for why they are right and the other guy is wrong speak only to the different habituations of those to be tamed.  One doesn't have to be a perennialist to see this.

Malcolm wrote:
What non-dual means in Buddhadharma is really quite different than what it means say to Sankara and even Gaudapada. Gaudapada may have been sympathetic towards Mahāyāna philosophy, and in the Agamasastra he indiscriminately cribbed yogacara and madhyamaka arguments to refute  Samkhya and Vaṣesika and so on.

What nisprapañca means is also different in these systems.

So, I don't really agree that all these systems are trying to get the same point, or have the same path, etc. As far as I can tell, Advaitans are climbing up one mountain, Buddhists are climbing a different mountain altogether.

Apart from a common agreement that kleṣas are what is responsible for transmigration, I don't see these systems as having much in common in terms of how they present the basis, the path and the result.

It is not that it, like space, is without any of the qualities, powers, and aspects of a buddha, and it is not like the self of persons that the forders impute to be permanent."
Mountain Doctrine, ppg. 118-119.

But you, from the beginning of this discussion have asserted that the other emptiness asserted by Dolbupa is exactly the affirmation of the atman of the Vedantins and so on.

Emptiness of a self as well as the absence of intrinsic identity in phenomena, is merely a consequence of dependent origination.

It is very clear, for example, that the tathāgatagarbha doctrine was swiftly marginalized in mainstream Mahāyāna circles. We can see this by virtue of the fact that the Lankāvatara sūtra clearly describes the ālayavijñāna as being the tathāgatagarbha. There exists but two commentaries devoted to tathāgatgarbha doctrine in the bstan 'gyur.

In general, tathāgatagarbha doctrine becomes more prominent in Vajrayāna for various reasons beyond the scope.

There is no passage in the nikayas that states, unambiguously, the Buddha "rejected the interpretation that there is a self outside the aggregates." To assert such is also to assert there is nothing outside or beyond the five murderous aggregates (S.iii.114) which also happen to be Mara the killer (S.iii.189). Neither the Buddha nor his disciples identified their self with the aggregates anymore then they might identify their self with a burning pile of grass, twigs, branches and foliage.


Malcolm wrote:
Hi Ardent:

Isn't boring to rehash arguments we had on AOL?

Vasubandhu (cf. Poussin/Pruden) quotes several sources from the Agamas having stated his thesis at the outset:
"There is neither direct perception nor inference of a soul (atman) independent of the skandhas. We know then that a real soul does not exist."
He then cites his authorities such as the Bimbisāra sūtra:
"A stupid ignorant Pṛthagjana becomes attached to words, and he imagines there is a self; but there is no self nor things pertaining to a self, but only past, present and future painful dharmas".
He cites another, also cited in the Sūtrālaṃkara:
"Five calamities proceed from the belief in a soul(atman): one creates a theory of a soul, of a being, of a vital principle, one is not distinguished from heterodox teachers...: etc.
Even the tathāgatagarbha sūtras take great pains to differentiate their "atman" from the atman posited by Pudgalavadins and Hindus because the tatāgatagarbha is merely a gloss for dharmatā.

For example, Ārya-tathāgatagarbha-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
Whether or not that dharmatā of dharmas produces tathāgatas, these sentient beings always contain tathāgatagarbha.
Now, depending on what you understand dharmatā to mean, then you will understand this in that light. But since there can be no dharmatā without dharmas, it is ludicrous to say this if this tathagātagarbha is other than the aggregates it is also the nature of the aggregates.

Personally, my impression of the main message of the tathagatagarbha sutras is that people should not feel awakening is beyond their capacity. For example, is how this passage from the Tathāgatagarbha sūtra reads:
"Sons of a good family, in the same way all sentient beings are without protection, are tormented with the sufferings of samsara, abiding in a house without a protector, the place of birth in the world. Now, the family of tathagatas exists in all sentient beings, but those it exists in them, those sentient being do not comprehend this.

Suns of a good family, because the Tathāgata do not malign sentient being themselves, sons of good family, you yourselves must not be disheartened, and have firm diligence! There will come a time when the Tathāgata enters into you and you will enter into the ranks of the bodhisattvas and will not be called "sentient beings". Further, when you have entered the ranks of the buddhas, you will not be called "bodhisattvas".
And:
It was taught, "Sentient beings who do not understand dharmatā,
do not generate the thought of 'I am inferior'!"
You must set out with firm diligence,
your own body will become a victor without long delay.
Once one has obtained the heart of awakening,
one will be able to liberate 10,000,000,000 creatures.

If the requirement of Shinay for the arising of Bodhicitta is something debatable, that would be something to explore. Perhaps there are different views across the traditions,


Malcolm wrote:
I meant in the form realms, actually. The mind of any being in the form realm is concentrated to a degree extraordinary to a human being.

In any event, I think there is a problem of infinite regress in this argument in general. That is why I brought up the Buddha in hell point. This is traditionally where it is considered that Buddha first aroused bodhicitta. But of course it is a myth, and as such subject to interpretations.

Regarding Phae Tissadevo's position:
The anattā doctrine is only founding in Buddhism because the Buddha realised attā that is different from conditioned dhammas.
It is pretty clear this Sangharāja never studied Samkhya since in fact that is exactly what the Samkhya/Yoga schools maintains, that self or purusha is completely other than consciousness, senses, sense objects and the material body i.e. the twenty four tattvas (prakṛti, buddhi, ahaṃkara, manas, the five organs, five organs of action, the five subtle elements [tanmatras] and the five gross elements).

If an atman is what one wants to find, then there is no better system of finding it than Samkhya/Yoga.

Of course, Buddha was quite familiar with Samkhya, but for some reason did not present it in his teachings.

If you are a practitioner of completion stage practices, one Dzogchen manual  advises against receiving moxabustion or bloodletting treatments (including acupuncture needles).

If you are not a completion stage practitioner, then just make sure the tattoo artist is hygienic. It is better if they also are a Dharma person.

Further, do not get tattoos of Dharma themes below the waist, on one's left hand (since that is the one most people in Asia wipe with) and so on.

In other words, the empty nature of the basis is equivalent to it's "capacity" for anything whatsoever.

No, if that were the case, Dzogchen would be no different than Samkhya. A useful referent is the Sakya concept that lhun grub and gnas 'gyur, natural formation and transformation, are not mutually exclusive. Potentiality can be just as well explained through emptiness as it can existence, even more easily actually. In general, there is a discussion of the three kāyas of the basis i.e. emptiness, clarity and their inseparability. Because these are present as the basis, the three kāyas can manifest at the time of the result, since their base exists in the basis. But this does not mean that the three kāyas of the basis are identical with the three kāyas of the result. The basis is called the basis precisely because of nonrealization.

Buddhadharma is radically different than other traditions. Our view at base is dependent origination. As the Buddha said "He who sees dependent origination, sees the Dharma".

No I don't think so, because the imprints of both the Shinay and bodhicitta must be present, this is clear from the answer. And the imprints for bodhicitta are more difficult to cultivate, many practitioners of different paths attain different levels of calm abiding, bodhicitta is far rarer.

I have heard mentioned by Geshe la and several other masters that BSM was able to arouse Bodhictta in the hell realm only because of extensive cultivation of love, compassion and so forth in previous lifetimes. The arousing of bodhictta in hell is extremely rare, most beings give rise to it in the human realm. I would think the imprints for Shinay are far more common, since many beings have at some point been born in the Devas realms that require its cultivation.

Since BSM arising of BC required both these imprints (compassion etc. as well as Shinay), I don't think you can draw that conclusion from what Geshe la said. Because in these deva realms most beings are not cultivating BC. It is clear that both are required, one isn't enough, as G. indicated in his answer:
Just as the imprints for bodhicitta were there, which allowed it to be arisen from hell from witnessing the suffering there, a level of calm abiding had been attained in a previous life.

You are on the ball Malcolm... I think it is a very reasonable qualm so I asked Geshe SN what he thought of it while bringing his evening drink.

Geshe la said the Rikchung candidate was correct, in asserting calm abiding/shinay was necessary for the attainment of bodhicitta.

How then, does one explain Lord Shakyamuni's arousing of bodhicitta in the hell realms?

Geshe la certainly a new attainment of Shinay would not be possible in the hell realms, especially when one looks at the texts and the various conditions that are required for Shinay. However, the shinay had been achieved to some degree in a previous life. Just as the imprints for bodhicitta were there, which allowed it to be arisen from hell from witnessing the suffering there, a level of calm abiding had been attained in a previous life. This attainment does not necessarily carry over from rebirth to rebirth, but in this case it did.

So, Shakyamuni was able to bring forth the Shinay necessary to arise bodhicitta despite the difficult conditions of the hell realm.

Would love to explore this further but further input from Geshe la would have to wait until breakfast (European time).

I think your Geshes answer is speculative at best. It amounts to saying that anyone who had attained rebirth in a deva realm has the sufficient causes for arousing bodhicitta.

This is no more nor less than the analytical ultimate shown in Yogacara too, i.e., both ultimates are analytical and can be weighed on their merits in terms of argument. But the Buddhist path is not one of making dogmatic assertions about the ultimate. That is for other schools.

Further, Nāgārjuna clearly states:
Dependent on the relative, the ultimate is understood;
realizing the ultimate, nirvana is attained.
So we are to realize the non-categorized ultimate on the basis of our analysis of things -- not by mystical dogmatic assertions about transcendent nondual awarenesses.

No, absolutely not.

If you propose that there is some other self outside the all, Buddha would reply:
The Blessed One said, "What is the All? Simply the eye & forms, ear & sounds, nose & aromas, tongue & flavors, body & tactile sensations, intellect & ideas. This, monks, is called the All. [1] Anyone who would say, 'Repudiating this All, I will describe another,' if questioned on what exactly might be the grounds for his statement, would be unable to explain, and furthermore, would be put to grief. Why? Because it lies beyond range."

There is clearly no intention by the Buddha to teach some transcendent ultimate non-dual awareness in the NIkayas/Agamas. People who assert the opposite are simply dreaming.

So that's it, thats all there is.

In case you are worried that all those fabulous buddhaqualities would not be possible if emptiness is the real nature of everything, Nāgārjuna quips:
"For one whom emptiness is possible, for that one everything is possible;
for one whom emptiness is not possible, for that one everything is impossible."

I used attainment as a figure of speech, obviously one cannot attain what one already is and there is not, as you say, a person to know it, but I'd contend that the Supreme Seer "is" it and knows itself as it really is, which is not the aggregates, but rather transcendent pristine nondual Awareness. In any case, what happens when the impermanent aggregates dissolve or reenter the flux of becoming according to your view? If they cease to be in a state of becoming due to the removal of afflictions which cause rebirth, what is left?

Malcolm wrote:
No such supreme seer is discussed in the sūtras. Buddhas, possessors of non-abiding nirvana, are held to possess two kinds of omniscience. But this omniscience is held to arise from a cause. As Kamalashila points out, omniscience must have a cause, otherwise it would arise randomly at all times and in every place. Even Dolbupa does not deny the need for conventionally gathering the two accumulations.


Vidyaraja said:
I understand emptiness as applying to the phenomenal world of becoming or samsara. Once we see it as empty and anatta, we are released from it and attain awakening, which is a state free from becoming, impermanence, dukkha, and death. It is eternal, transcendent, blissful, indestructible, permanent, changeless, and Self.

Malcolm wrote:
You don't need to capitalize self.

Vidyaraja said:
Personally I don't understand how the views you and others describe, which have been accused of nihilism in the past and present and which, even if actually not nihilism, at least sounds close enough to it to have those charges brought up against it, could possibly be an attractive view of spirituality, the nature of ourselves, and our liberation. But as they say, 84,000 gates and various skillful means to account for the diversity of human needs and inclinations. I suppose the only way to know thing as they really are is to awaken.

Malcolm wrote:
We have no latent traces of attachment to divinity or any kind of supreme principle. We understand that samsara and nirvana are only possible because of the emptiness of both. We understand that both are nominal designations. As Nāgārjuna stated:
These two, samsara and nirvana do not exist.
Instead, thorough knowledge of samsara is nirvana.
And as Āryadeva stated, those who argue against emptiness, must argue for each and everything they argue is not empty, whereas Madhyamakas only need prove emptiness but once. So if your non-empty Buddhaqualities are infinite, you are left with the infinite task of proving each and everyone separately. I am sure there must be a hell for that...oh right, I forgot, it is called gzhan stong hell.

The non-eternalist view of nirvana (erroneously considered annihilationist in some quarters) is that nirvana is the permanent cessation of afflictions which lead to rebirth in samsara, leading to cessation of birth in samsara.

Malcolm wrote:
What is the difference between attaining the unconditioned state of nirvana and cessation of birth in samsara?
Cessations are not praptis, obtainments.

No one attains an unconditioned state of nirvana. There are no aggregates in nirvana and therefore, no person can be designated upon those aggregates. Nirvana is simply the cessation of the series of aggregates. Mind you, not the immediate cessation of aggregates, but rather the cessation of the afflictions that cause action which lead to rebirth. Another way to put it is that prajñā burns the afflictions. Once the afflictions are burnt, have no more effect, there is also no need for that prajñā so it too ceases.

Unknown said:
If we deny the former, what is left or what are we led to in the latter? Who or what has ceased being born in samsara and what is the resultant state from such a cessation? In what way is it not eternal? If annica is impermanence and related to dukkha, how is the conquest of samsara not eternal or permanent? If it is not eternal or permanent, why bother?

Malcolm wrote:
Nirvana is a permanent state of cessation of birth in samsara. It is an extreme. That is why Mahāyāna conceived of the idea of so called non-abiding nirvana (in contrast with the Nikāya "abiding" nirvana), i.e., being in samsara but not of samsara. In general, the nirvana aspired to in Mahāyāna is the non-abiding nirvana.

Basically, if the word emptiness raises the hair on your neck, it is sign that in the past you were a Mahāyāna practitioner. As for me, as soon as I heard the word "emptiness" I knew I was home, and have been a adherent of the Prajñāpāramitā ever since.

So if deepbluehum or anyone else knows about these topics please let me know.

Malcolm wrote:
Hi Zim:

People did Ngondro, but the overall systematization of Ngondro seems to be a rather nineteenth century phenomena that spread from Kagyu to the other two schools i.e. Nyingma and Sakya. For example, the massive 350 folio commentary on the Lam 'bras preliminaries authored by Zimog Tulku in the nineteenth century was explicitly influenced by Kun bzang bla ma'i zhal lung. Before this text, there was no separate Sakya Ngondro commentary. And the first independent Ngondro text in Sakya was written by Dezhung Rinpoche.

However, there was ngondro from an ancient period of time. For example, the klong gsal nyi ma 'bar ma rgyud [which probably dates to the 13th century and is the root tantra for the mkha' 'gro snying thig] has a fully elaborated ngondro from chapters 63-75. For example, the refuge chapter, 67, does not give a number. Chapter 73 specifies doing Vajrasattva for 21 days, for example.

In general, I think the idea of doing 100,000 thousand comes from the idea of reciting mantras 100,000 times in the gsar ma tantras.

Other melongs you may see are one's crafted for long life mirrors, which function to summon all the essence of the elements reflected in that mirror. Other mirrors are worn as good luck charms.

jeeprs said:
So I think understanding 'freedom from rebirth' is not actually a matter of whether you believe in reincarnation. It has a deeper meaning than that. It is about whether you are of this world, part of the whole cycle of birth-and-death, change-and-decay, rising-and-falling, that everything in nature is subject to. Nowadays we seem to think that 'natural' is good and wholesome, yet it is the case that everything in nature is subject to decay and death, even if it is temporarily beautiful, young and vital. Whatever is young becomes old, whatever is born will one day die. That is an inevitable fact for every born being.

So is there is something that is beyond change and decay, that is not subject to the constant cycle of birth and death, something that is always new, never perishing? I think that is what the Buddha found and points to. Living in the light of that, realizing what that is and making oneself available to it, is the meaning of 'liberation from the cycle of birth and death'. And I think that is the real 'meaning of rebirth' - not the exotic idea of 'I will be reborn for many lifetimes'.

Canada has always had more strict censorship policies than the US, following the lead of England.

Once the Civil Rights movment in the 1960's was more or less successful in eliminating Jim Crow laws and so on, all similar laws discriminating against people on the basis of religion, gender or gender preference were bound to fail, as they should fail.

You may reflect on how this quotation also neatly puts paid to your assertions that 1) madhaymikas do not make assertions, and 2) the Gelug view is that ultimate truth is a non-existent, as Je Tsongkhapa follows Chadrakirti precisely on this point and Chadrakirti here rejects that explicit assertion.

Malcolm wrote:
The rendering you are using is a somewhat inaccurate gloss.

The text says:
saṁvṛtyā mādhyamikairastitvenābhyupagamānna tulyatā
དབུ་མ་པ་དག་གིས་ནི་ཀུན་རྫོབ་ཏུ་ཡོད་པར་ཁས་བླངས་པའི་ཕྱིར

"Because Mādhyamikas agree to existence in the relative..."

The text does not say they "assert" ['dod pa], or established [sgrub pa], etc. It says ābhyupagamā, which means assent, agree, etc.

The Tibetan recension contains an extra passage: དེ་དག་གིས་ཁས་མ་བླངས་པའི་ཕྱིར་མི་མཚུངས་པ་ཉིད་དོ།

"and because they [atheists] do not agree [to existence in the relative], [mādhyamikas and atheists] are not the same.

However, this passage is a clarification about what exists relatively, not ultimately. The set up for your citation is:
Here, someone contends "Mādhyamikas are no different than atheists [nāstikas, literally "deniers"]. For what reason? They claim virtuous and non-virtuous actions, agents, results and all worlds are empty of inherent existence., and also atheists also claim those things do not exist. Therefore, mādhyamikas are no different than atheists."

That is not so. Mādhyamikas are proponents of dependent origination. Because of production in connection with conditions this world and all other worlds beyond are proposed to be empty of inherent existence because they are produced in connection with conditions.  Other worlds and so on are not conceived as non-existent through emptiness of inherent existence because of production in connection with conditions.

Now then, if it is asked why, they [atheists] reject other things similar to the things perceived in this world based upon the inherent perception of things of this world, having not perceived coming into this world from another world and going into another world from this world. [a complex way of saying atheists only believe what they can see]

If it is said, "In that case, because they conceive the absence of existence in the intrinsic nature of things as non-existence there is a similarity through this view." It is not so. Because Mādhyamikas agree to existence in the relative and because they [atheists] do not agree [to existence in the relative], [mādhyamikas and atheists] are not the same.
The context of the language goes back to the idea that those who deny the Vedas are "nastikas", deniers or atheists [better word than nihilist, in my opinion]. Buddhists are considered nastikas by Hindus. Here Candra is rejecting the claim by pointing out cleverly that since Madhyamakas agree to [rather than assert or establish] such thing as karma, agents, results, this world, future worlds, etc., relatively speaking, even though they do not agree to essences, they agree to the moral structure of Indian religious discourse which in general is based on the idea of future lives, karma, etc.

But I don't think we can consider these so called atheists necessarily Carvakas or Lokayatis, etc., people who for example assert existence by virtue of svābhava. The classic example representing the Carvaka view is that things exist through their nature just like the colors in a peacocks feather. No one created it, it just happens that way. Unfortunately, we do not have any actual Carvaka texts, just parodies of their views here and there in Buddhist and Hindu texts and plays. These so called atheists may very well be just those who do not subscribe to a siddhaṇta, whether buddhist nor non-buddhist.

Finally, this passage does not defend your assertion that Tsongkhapa does not himself assert the ultimate is a non-existence, since we have already seen that you admit he does assert a non-existence as ultimate i.e. the non-existence of inherent existence in the ultimate.

Sure they do-- Tsongkhapa asserts the non-existence of inherent existence is the ultimate. Now you might argue that non-existence exists, as I am sure you will; but nevertheless, the Gelug view is that ultimate truth is a non-existence.

What I mean is this: Malcolm said earlier in this thread that incorrect views are not really dispelled through reasoning, but through realization, and I agree with that. I also have a lot of faith in the realization of Dudjom R and Dilgo K. If the orthodox Nyingma position, or at least the position of masters like Rongzom and Longchenpa, is not shentong, then they (DR and DKR) must have had good reason to go against that, I would think. So, there seems to be some issue here. Let me also say that I don't know enough about this stuff to have a position one way or the other, although intuitively based on what little I do know, I doubt that I would be a shentongpa.


Malcolm wrote:
As I have written elsewhere; gzhan stong principally arises from the hermeneutical urge to reconcile the treatises of Maitreya and Nāgārjuna with one another. Because Tibetan scholars typically assume that Maitreyanatha is identical to the future Bodhisattva Maitreya, they often feel they cannot privilege Nāgārjuna's views over those of Maitreya.

My feeling about Maitreyanatha is rather different. I feel he was just a normal human person, who lived at a time when there were three major trends of Mahāyāna sutras, i.e., prajñāpāramita, yogacara, and tathāgagarbha. He wrote five treatises: Sūtrālaṃkara which presents a systematic account of Mahāyāna synthesizing all three trends primarily from a Yogacara perspective
Abhisamayālaṃkara which presents the implicit paths and stages concealed within the prajñāpāramita sutras
Uttaratantra which synthesizes the thought of the ten tathāgatagarbha sūtras
Madhyantavibhaga and the Dharmadharmatāvibhaga which analyzes specific issues in Yogacara thought.
I do not feel that it is necessary to try and reconcile these various trends. What is important is to understand the ideas presented in these three trends and then observe how they are used by later schools and scholars.

For example, the way tathāgatagarbha is used in Secret Mantra and Dzogchen is quite different than the way it is presented in the Uttaratantra. The way Dolbupa uses the three nature theory is very different than the way it is used in the Yogacara of Maitreya and Asanga.

Now, it is true that there is a commentary on the Uttaratantra attributed to Asanga, and some scholars believe it is authored by him as well; but if so, this merely reinforces my elsewhere mentioned thesis that the Yogacara school and the Tathāgatagarbha were regarded as separate streams in Indian Mahāyāna and not mixed up with each other.

Of course, this statement in the Āryalaṅkāvatāra-nāma-mahāyānasūtravṛttitathāgatahṛdayālaṃkāra is very nice:
"The dharmatā of the mind liberated from the four extremes constitutes the sugatagarbha."
Here is another nice definition by Municandra in Sūtrālaṃkāravṛttibhāṣya:
"As such, since suchness exists in sentient beings, because of that, all sentient beings are tathāgatagarbhins."
This means that sentient beings enclose or hold (garbhin) the garbha of the tathātagatas, i.e., suchness.

Of course the Tarkajvala by Bhavya maintains:
The statement "The tathāgata pervades" means wisdom pervades all objects of knowledge, but it does not mean abiding in everything like Viśnu. Further, "Tathāgatagarbhin" means emptiness, signlessness and absence of aspiration exist the continuums of all sentient beings, but is not an inner personal agent pervading everyone".

So, is there anything which is ultimately real, which does possess 'own-being'?
My favorite thing to quote is from Khenpo Tsultrim's "Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness". In the chapter on Shentong he writes:

"This non-conceptual Wisdom Mind is not the object of the conceptualizing process and so is not negated by Madhyamaka reasoning. Therefore, it can be said to be the only thing that has absolute and true existence."

He goes on to explain that the non-conceptual Wisdom Mind is not self-empty like Nagarjuna's 4 points or the Prajnaparamita Sutras describe. They are "empty-of-other", that is empty of anything other than its own pure essence that is replete with the qualities of Buddhahood.

(btw Malcolm does not subscribe to this idea.)

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, and this is why gzhan stong does not really go beyond the false aspectarian yogacara of Ratnakaraśanti. The main difference between the two is that the former avoids the error of the latter, who assert that the non-existence of the imagined nature in the dependent nature is the perfected nature, thus setting up an internal contradiction that the dependent nature becomes unconditioned. Charitably, we can say that gzhan stong is an intermediate view between Yogacara and Madhyamaka.

The main error of the gzhan stong pas however, as I have written elsewhere, is the attempt to map the two truths onto the three natures, where they consider the perfected nature the ultimate and the imagined and the dependent natures relative. In doing, so, they basically do violence to the Yogacara school's own formulation of these three natures. The reason they do this is that there has been a compelling exegetical need of Tibetan scholars to rectify the treatises of Maitreya as a whole with the six texts of reasoning by Nāgārjuna. In the end, both systems lose since neither is accurately represented. Basically, gzhan stong represents an attempt to reconcile all the main lines of Indian Mahāyāna thought as I have noted elsewhere.

Further, by mixing the tathātagarbha doctrine into the mix, they also ruin that. The odd thing is is that Asanga was not fond of the tathāgatagarbha school.

Many people act as if Madhyamaka and Madhyamaka influenced scholars present the truth (tm) in Buddhism. But it is not true. Madhyamakas continued to be criticized by both other Mahāyānists as well as by Nikāya schools until Buddhadharma perished in India.

It is primarily because Vajrayāna Buddhism enshrined Madhyamaka as the supreme tenet of sūtra that today we observe Madhyamaka is the something like the King of Buddhist philosophy to which everyone must pay homage, even  scholars like Dolbupa.

That being said, I am myself, of course, of the conviction that Nāgārjuna got it right. Frankly, to borrow a phrase from Whithead, "The safest general characterization of the Buddhist philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Nāgārjuna."

Further, like other Vajrayāna traditions, Dzogchen provides a physical account for the process of rebirthm for example in the Vajramala Tantra it is proposed that the alayavijñāna inseparable with the mahāprāṇavāyu is responsible for transmigration, for the appropriation of a new series of aggregates. But Dzogchen goes a step further and explicitly identifies consciousness as the operation of a vāyu in the body. Vāyus of course are the function of the refined element of air inside the human body.

The non-categorizable emptiness has no characteristics so it cannot be a direct object of a conventional mind. As Shantideva states, "the ultimate is not within the experiential range of the mind".

Obviuously, categorizable emptiness can be conceived by a conventional mind since that kind of emptiness is also a convention, designated on the discovery of a non-existence such as this seed is empty of inherent existence because it is a product. Whatever inherently exists cannot be a product.

Conventionally speaking however, a non-conceptual wisdom "apprehends" emptiness.

All four traditions of Tibetan Buddhism, when correctly understood, reject substance dualism. The Gelugpas, at least, also present the teachings in such a way as to allow someone prone to substance dualism to benefit from it a provisional stance. I suspect the other traditions do as well. Each tradition is very rich.

Well, it is true that because the five schools [we must include Bon] are tantric, they have a better shot at it.

Frankly, all many people want from meditation and yoga is a lack of stress in this life. Buddha also provided for this kind of person, as it made perfectly clear in the Kalamas sutra. If we classify the kind of teaching that Batchelor and people like him, the so called Secular Buddhists, seem to advocate, they are teaching what is termed by the Buddha as "the vehicles of devas and humans". But that is a Buddhist vehicle, and we have to respect it as such, even if we imagine we want more, something like total liberation.

Again, it boils down to the patches on Buddha's robes.

Malcolm wrote:
The Tathāgatagarbha sūtra does not use the word dharmadhātu even once. It simply is not used in that sūtra as it is present in the bka' gyur

Yup, you are correct, in terms of the Nirvana sūtra, the search engine I used was flawed it will not return searches in texts that span two volumes.

So, I checked via other means and In the Tibetan recension of the two volumes of the Nirvana sutra the term "chos kyi dbyings" i.e. dharmadhātu occurs exactly total of sixteen times.  It does not suffer this problem for shorter sutras that do not span volumes. Since the other tathāgatagarbha sūtras are quite short, I have no fear that my search was flawed. Here it is, BTW:

http://www.istb.univie.ac.at/kanjur/xml3/xml/

Here is another interesting quote from the Nirvana sutra:
Son of a good family, all phenomena are false, where they cease, that is called "true", "a true perception", "dharmadhātu", "wisdom of perfection", "ultimate" and "ultimate emptiness".

It's neglected, since a proper and thorough examination of the term dharmadhātu revealed that it occurs exactly 16 times in the Nirvana sūtra's Tibetan recension.

Basically, all you atmanvadins are doing is merely imposing Samkhya onto Buddhism.


Vidyaraja said:
Just because the Buddha had a unique conceptual system for expressing the inexpressible and leading his followers to the one Truth doesn't mean he denied the Self.

“I have seen,” the Buddha says, “the ancient Way, the Old Road that was taken by the formerly All-Awakened, and that is the path I follow”; and since he elsewhere praises the Brāhmaṇs of old who remembered the Ancient Way that leads to Brahma, there can be no doubt that the Buddha is alluding to “the ancient narrow path that stretches far away, whereby the contemplatives, knowers of Brahma, ascend, set free” (vimuktāḥ), mentioned in verses that were already old when Yajñavalkya cites them in the earliest Upaniṣad.

The four westerners (Coomaraswamy was western educated) you mentioned are all deeply influenced by Theosophy. Coomaraswamy may have been a genius, but his understanding of Buddhism is sorely deficient as far as I am concerned.

I doubt Shenphen Hookham as the same idea about this that you do. gzhan stong is complicated, has many schools, and Kongtrul's (about which she wrote) is basically a modified version of Sakya Chogden's gzhan stong, which is markedly different than Dolbupa's version.

In my opinion basic standards which would indicate a person or a school is Buddhist in orientation are:

A dharma theory based on skandhas, dhātus and āyatanas.

A theory of suffering based on of affliction and dependent origination.

A path theory based on śamatha and vipaśyāna.

Acceptance of the four seals.

A concept of refuge.

I think that this basic framework provides a wide latitude for differences of opinion, including for example eternalist interpretations of the tathāgatagarbha sutras or the austere doctrine of emptiness taught in Madhyamaka and Prajñāpāramitā. It even has room for "heretics" like Batchelor and Zenmar.

I wouldn't say it is clear cut that this view is an import into Buddhadharma. Many have argued and continue to do so that the Buddha didn't deny the Self but rather used anatta as a via negativa approach to deny reality to the empirical self consisting of the impermanent aggregates. See my post in this thread for some quotes on this:

Malcolm wrote:
What you are suggesting is already found in Samkhya system. I.e. the twenty four tattvas are not the self aka purusha. Since this system was well known to the Buddha, if that's all his insight was, then his insight is pretty trivial. But Buddha's teachings were novel. Why where they novel? They were novel in the fifth century BCE  because of his teaching of dependent origination and emptiness. The refutation of an ultimate self is just collateral damage.



Vidyaraja said:
Now, you are free to disagree, but if this line of thought (which is shared by other scholars like George Grimm, CAF Rhys Davids, Perez-Remon, Ananda Coomaraswamy, the Thais of the Dhammakaya movement, other Theravadins, etc.) is correct, then the no-self doctrine as applied to Nirvana is an import into Buddhadharma.

Malcolm wrote:
Their views are important as part of the history of ideas; however, no serious expert in the field of Buddhist studies really holds their theosophically informed opinions in any regard.

Vidyaraja said:
As to saying that this view doesn't bring about realization, I think numerous Hindu sages from the time of the Vedic rishis up to modern figures like Nisargadatta Maharaj, the Christian mystics like Pseudo-Dionysius or Meister Eckhart, the Sufi sheikhs such as Ibn Arabi and Rumi, Neoplatonist mystics like Plotinus and Iamblichus, Taoists like Lao Tzu, Jains like Mahavira, the Sikhs, Kabbalists, various occult figures, and various Amerindians who speak of the Great Spirit, as well as the Buddhist masters like Dolpopa, and various Zen figures like Huang Po would disagree. Now of course, all intellectual views must be transcended to reach the wordless, intuitive, direct realization of Truth, but nonetheless. My point is, while many of these sages aren't Buddhists, the Madhyamika figures who deny the transcendent Absolute and the Great Self are the minority in the spiritual history of mankind.

Malcolm wrote:
But they are clearly defined majority in the annals of Buddhadharma, which is our subject of discussion.

Vidyaraja said:
You are free to believe that they are an elite who have had the highest realization and everyone else has been deluded or of inferior realization, but for one I refuse to believe that is the case, not only because of the unity across time, culture, religion, etc. of those figures who maintained this view, but because of my own experience tells me otherwise.

Malcolm wrote:
You are a perennialist. This is fine, but you do realize that your views are a severely minority opinion in Buddhadharma.

It is not a question of higher or lower realization. The fact is that the liberation to which you aspire is not one I share. It does not mean I am going to deny you the right to call yourself a Buddhist because you happen to hold views that I consider to be out of step with the primary trends of the evolution of Buddhist teachings. The fact is that the liberation to which Batchelor aspires is not one I share. The fact is that the liberation to which the Pure Land people aspire is not one I share. The fact is that the liberation to which the Theravadins aspire is not one I share. The fact is that the liberation to which Zen practitioners aspire is not one I share. But they are all Buddhists and the all aspire to freedom.

Beyond that, the fact is that the liberation to which Samkhya, Vedanta, Yoga, Vaiśeṣika, Nyaya and Mimamsa aspire is not one I share. But they are also seeking freedom, so I consider them Dharma, albeit, not Buddhadharma. The same goes with all other spiritual paths.

We are all alike in that we are seeking truth and freedom that truth brings. But I do not think for an instant that we all seeking the same truth or the same freedom.

The strength of Buddha's patched robe is that it is able to accommodate such disagreement and so many different point of view of about what Buddha himself meant when he discoursed about truth and freedom.

When it comes to tenets, I think Madhyamaka is the most definitive teaching, when it comes to sūtras, think the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras are the most definitive, and I when it comes to vajrayāna, I think Dzogchen is the most definitive teaching. But that is just my perspective.

" The Great Madhyamaka (dbu-ma chen-po) is aloof from the reasoning of the Outer Madhyamaka which is based upon dialectics, and instead must be experientially cultivated in meditation. "


Malcolm wrote:
In Bhavya's text, the difference between the so called coarse outer madhyamaka and the inner subtle madhyamaka merely has to do with how relative truth is treated. I reproduce the entire passage below. You will notice an absence of the terms Prasanga, Svatantra. When one, as a Madhyamaka, treats relative truth from the perspective of the śravakas, this is considered coarse outer madhyamaka. When relative truth is treated from the cittamatra point of view, then this becomes the subtle inner madhyamaka:

When phenomenal entities are categorized, in this way there are two kind: material and immaterial. In this way, material entities appearing as portions of subtle atoms do not exist and also subtle atoms appearing as limited by different directions do not exist. They are immaterial mind. Meanwhile, mind and mental factors are engaged for a moment.Since appearing because of the very subtle aspect through the differentiation of past, present and future does not exist, minds and mental factors are not established, becoming the nature of the dharmadhātu, in which one should abide. The Mother states: "That mind is not mind, because the primal nature [prakṛiti] of the mind is luminosity" and "whever the mind does not exist, that is inconceivable". 

Further, all phenomena can be gathered into the mind, mind gathered into the body, after the body is gathered into the dharmadhātu, it dissolves. The meaning of this is also spoken of by the Ācarya Nāgārjuna in the Madhyamaka Bhāvasaṃkranta:
The world comes from concepts; concepts come from the mind;
the mind is supported on the body, for that reason investigate the body.
One should dwell in such a meaning. Do not do not dwell on any kind of occasion or consciousness. Do not conceive anything, do not think about anything, do not dwell all extremes. The essence of any consciousness has not arisen, one should meditate on nothing at all. Further, that prajñā of through analysis does not appear. For example, since fire is produced by rubbing to sticks together vigorously, if the wood is burnt, also the that fire is understood to naturally pacified, because it also has become non-existent. The meaning of this can be understood in the Ārya-kāśyapaparivarta sūtra. Further, in the Ārya-ghanavyūha sūtra:
Just the fire which is the burning agent does not exist 
since the burnt object does not exist,
likewise if one burns the view to be incinerated, 
also the fire of emptiness will cease. 
At the time of the cessation of views, 
the fire of wisdom will not be produced, 
all afflictions having been incinerated. 
If the afflictions are incinerated, the aspect is beautiful.
Mahāsukha (aka Padmavajra) says:
Having burned the bundle of firewood of views
with the fire of emptiness, 
this is abiding in peace, 
in which the fire of suchness has also ceased.
As such, having taught the coarse yoga, now the subtle yoga will be taught. This is subtle i.e. all dharmas there can be arise as the appearances of one's mere illusory mind itself. In this way, the mere illusory mind is beyond the three times. Without color or shape, luminous through its primal nature. Since it does not appear, all phenomena are to be understood as being the illusory mind itself. There are also citations. The Ārya Lankāvatara states:
In dependance on mind-only, 
do not analyze outer objects; 
in dependence upon suchness
one must transcend mind-only. 
If one transcends mind-only, 
one will abide in non-appearances. 
The yogi abiding in non-appearances, 
he sees the Mahāyāna.
Ārya Nāgārjuna, Ācarya Āryadeva, Ācarya Candrakīrti speak it in these words. In this way, speaking about the relative truth in the manner of the śravakas is the coarse outer madhyamaka. That [relative] existing as one's mind only is the so called  "inner madhyamaka" which is subtle.

There are three things to include here: one, this author, Bhavya, is very late -- he is not the same author as Bhavaviveka. This is proven by two things: one, he mentions Candrakirti. Second, he cites Mahasukha aka Padmavajra and directly cites Padmavajra's text Sakalatantrasambhavasaṃcodanī-śrīguhyasiddhi-nama. Padmavajra may be the same person as Padmasambhava.

At any rate, this text itself is no later than the tenth century but no earlier than the eighth.  This places Bhavya subsequent to Padmavajra, that and Atisha brought the text to Tibet in the 11th.

Third, Bhavya mentions a great madhyamaka three times in this text. But first person we know of to use the term in any surviving text was the Tibetan Kawa Paltseg. He uses the term great madhyamaka as a sobriquet for freedom from extremes.

So frankly, when gzhan stong pas use this passage from Bhavya to support their notion that great madhyamaka is a non-analytical meditation, their reasoning is pretty flimsy when the citation they use to distinguish an outer and an inner madhyamaka.

No, it is the opposite actually, in my opinion, those people within Buddhadharma who assert a transcendent absolute, a mahātman, etc. are the intellectuals since they are the ones who have to spin the most elaborate hermeneutics to justify their opinions, for example Dolbuba.
Here's a cut and paste from something Dudjom R. wrote. He starts by quoting somebody else:

Concerning the subtle, inner Great Madhyamaka of definitive meaning, it is stated in the Jewel Lamp of the Madhyamaka by the master Bhavya (skal-ldan):

The Madhyamaka of the Prasangika and the Svatantrika is the coarse, Outer Madhyamaka. It should indeed be expressed by those who profess well-informed intelligence during debates with [extremist] Outsiders, during the composition of great treatises, and while establishing texts which concern supreme reasoning. However, when the subtle, inner Madhyamaka is experientially cultivated, one should meditate on the nature of Yogacara-Madhyamaka.

Elsewhere I've seen him say that Prasangika Madhyamaka is for intellectual approach to emptiness and Great Madyamaka (Shentong) is for discussing it from a meditational standpoint without quoting anybody else, but this is what I found with a quick search.

Son of Buddha said:
can you source this in the Sutras for us all??

(I could of swore the texts that teach Buddha Nature say it is Not-Empty)

Malcolm wrote:
It is more complicated than that. I spent a few minutes this morning running a word search on the bka' 'gyur and I found that only five of the ten tathagatagarbhasūtras say anything at all about the dharmadhātu, and only four of them say anything meaningful.

The Angulimāla sutra says:
The dhātu of all sentient beings (sarvasattvadhātu) is the dharmadhātu,
since flesh is consumed of the same dhātu, the buddhas do not consume meat.
It is presented in the context of eating meat. Basically, cannibalism is a taboo in general, and by making the observation that the dharmdhātu is the sattvadhātu, in this sutra the Buddha is making an argument we ought not meat since we are all of the same kind.

The Nirvana Sūtra only contains two explicit mentions of the dharmadhātu:
Empty peace is the dharmadhātu...
Son of a good family, if one of average prajñā truly courses in the dharmadhātu, wisdom of perfection, ultimate truth and ultimate emptiness, that one will attain the śravakas awakening; the one of medium prajñā, the pratyekabuddha awakening, and one is best prajñā, unsurpassed awakening.
There is another sūtra, Ārya-maladevīsiṃhanāda sūtra, that states:
"Bhagavan, this tathāgatagarbha is the sublime dharmadhātu. It is the dharmakāyagarbha, it is the garbha of transcendent phenomena [lokkotaradharmas], it is the garbha of the naturally pure dharmakāya. Bhagavan, since temporary secondary afflictions are naturally pure as the tathāgatagarbha, these secondary afflictions are the site of the tathāgatas."
This sutra pretty clearly states that afflicted phenomena cannot be excluded from the tathāgatagarbha, more or less repeating the thinking of the Angulimala sūtra above.

Ok, therefore, we can see that that tathagatagarbha sūtras are of no help in defining dharmadhātu.

The Ārya-gaganagañjaparipṛcchā-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra is the likely locus classicus for the explicit notion that the dharmadhātu is a source. Let me preface this by saying that in Tibetan, the term "dhātu" is glossed as a 'byung gnas, a locus of production, not as a basis or a foundation [gzhi/rtsa ba]. The nature of meaning of the term dhātu is translated into is "dbyings", which has a native meaning as a dimension [klong] or a element [khams]. When it is defined by Vasubandhu he defines the term dhātu as being similar to a mine. Now, the sūtra states:
Phenomena do not come and do not go, they dwell in the dharmadhātu;
all that appears as form, it all comes from space;
all that appears as phenomena[dharmas], those come from the dharmadhātu.
Still we are no closer to a conclusive definition of dharmadhātu.

The Lankāvatara helps us: Suchnness, emptiness, nirvana and the dharmadhātu,
the non-arising phenomena, are nature of the ultimate.
So here in this text we have a clear demonstration that suchnness, emptiness, nirvana and the dharmadhātu are all to be treated as synonymous.

The Śatasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā states: Further, because the dharmadhātu does not exist, it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the extreme of the past; because the dharmadhātu is emptiness, it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the extreme of the past; because the dharmadhātu is isolated it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the extreme of the past; because the dharmadhātu lacks an intrinsic nature, it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the extreme of the past. Further, because the dharmadhātu does not exist, it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the extreme of the future; because the dharmadhātu is emptiness, it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the extreme of the future; because the dharmadhātu is isolated it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the extreme of the future; because the dharmadhātu lacks an intrinsic nature, it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the extreme of the future. Further, because the dharmadhātu does not exist, it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the middle; because the dharmadhātu is emptiness, it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the middle; because the dharmadhātu is isolated it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the middle; because the dharmadhātu lacks an intrinsic nature, it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the middle.

So in reality, we see that in the Tathagatagarbha sūtra cycle, the notion of dharmadhātu is rather neglected doctrinally; I would suggest, precisely because of its association with emptiness as presented in the PP sūtras, which in no way permits a reading of a positive ground which serves as the basis for the arising of phenomena. And as we have seen above, the Nirvana sūtra explicitly defines dharmadhātu as emptiness.

Malcolm wrote:
Conditioned phenomena dependently originate; unconditioned phenomena do not arise at all. Other than that, there is no source. This is why dependent origination is called "profound". The logic of dependent origination precludes a "source" for conditioned phenomena, transcendent or otherwise.

Your view is just one among many imports into Buddhadharma, just like Batchelor's views. In my opinion you are both mistaken -- but that does not really matter, because intellectual views like yours and Batchelors, in the end, are not what bring about realization.

If you believe Asanga, you own Buddha Nature is unconditioned phenomena. It is your own nature, yet cannot be taken as an object of consciousness, yours or anybody else's for that matter. It is an example of something unborn having functionality--the functionality being you!

If you believe the Buddha as he is presented in the Lankāvatara sutra, tathāgatagarbha is merely an intermediate doctrine for those who are frightened of emptiness.
