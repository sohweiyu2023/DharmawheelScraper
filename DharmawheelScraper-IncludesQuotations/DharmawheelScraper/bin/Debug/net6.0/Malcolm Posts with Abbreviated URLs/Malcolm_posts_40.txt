The point that Dzogchen tantras consistently make is that practicing the two stages of creation and completion are at best an indirect means of coming to that recognition, and at worst a total deviation from the meaning of the Great Perfection. Rongzom points out that one should not discriminate between mantra or sūtra practice when it comes to the indirect approach. Recognition is the important point in Dzogchen, nothing else.

Seriously though: I believe you and Crazy Wisdom are selling your previous teachers and practice short by not acknowledging the fact that your past practice paid off by generating the merit necessary for you to meet your precious gurus.  Instead of denigrating what were quite possibly the means by which you arrived at your current state/position/realisation, you should be extraordinarily grateful.  You should not be trying so hard to dissuade others are you may actually be encouraging them to abandon the only means they currently have at hand, to reach the point that you are currently at.

Malcolm wrote:
I am not dissuading anyone from anything. People are free. If they wish to practice the two stages, let them. I am encouraging people who are interested in Dzogchen teachings to understand that Dzogchen is an independent path, which does not depend on the vehicles of cause and result.

It may be the case that in modern Tibetan Buddhism Dzogchen has become mixed with anuyoga teachings, especially at the level of empowerments. For example, the Longchen Nyinthig is mostly deity practices. The Dzogchen section of it is very short, only a few very short texts (Yeshe Lama is not part of the Longchen Nyinthig, though it is included in the supporting text material).

Further, it is a very common practice to include the empowerment of the potential of vidyā ( rig pa'i rtsal dbang ) within a standard deity yoga empowerment (sometimes called "the fifth empowerment") or to include that in the fourth empowerment. But Dzogchen also has it own independent empowerments which are not based on any kind of deity yoga path.

You are continuing to talk about empowerments like Troma Nagmo and Namchak Putri which are mixed cycles:

Grigoris said:
I know that, but I am. I am continuing to explain my point.

Malcolm wrote:
"Mixed" means that they introduce a yidam as part of the path, they are more gradual cycles. No one disputes that people attain rainbow body from practicing such cycles. Of course they do, they contain the main practices of Dzogchen, trekchöd and thögal.

For example, Vajravārāhī is an important part of the Gongpa Zangthal. There is also a Shitro. It is said there that Vārāhī is present for people of intermediate capacity.  The same can be said of the Khandro Nyinthig.  The retreats of the deities of these cycles are one week, not months and years.

But this is not what CW and I are talking about. We are talking about Dzogchen as it is presented within the Dzogchen tantras themselves and their related instructions such as the Vima Nyinthig, which have zero deity yoga practices as part of the path.

Asserting that those who understand are liberated merely by recognizing concepts as dharmatā is the fruit of one’s wishes. As such, in order to recognize that concepts are dharmatā, the intimate instructions of the guru are important.

Vasana said:
And so i think it's fair to say that deliberate effort and dilligence in applying the instructions of the Guru is needed to realize effortless liberation even if that liberation it's self is not the result of the causal process of effort. As you said earlier, 'creation and completion are at best an indirect means of coming to that recognition.' Sounds like a pretty good outcome for those suited to it even if it's indirect. I guess the problem is that there's a thin line between it being an aid or a deviation.

Malcolm wrote:
The indirect means has the same principle— recognizing concepts as dharmatā. This is also based on a guru's instructions. In both cases, recognition is the point. For example, when you encounter someone you know in  a crowd, there is no effort involved in recognizing them. If you have not met someone and only know their name, unless there is someone who can introduce you, you will spend a long time asking every person in the crowd if they are so and so.

While I appreciate that this is all valid from the perspective of the meaning of Dzogchen, doesn't the insistence of no effort required then lead to the argument that sentient beings should already be realized Buddhas in actuality and not just potentiality? Using the various Dzogchen preliminaries as an example, these involve initial effort even if the actual state recognized is beyond effort. I can't remember who said it but it makes me think of the phrase, 'The Artificial leads to the natural' & 'The path of effort leads to effortlessness'. Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche from 'As it is vol 2,

“Honestly, for a beginner, without the mindfulness of reminding, there is no recognition of mind essence. That is called deliberate mindfulness. It is dualistic mind that reminds you to recognize, but the seeing of no thing to be seen is rigpa, the awakened state free of duality. This becomes dearly discerned through practical experience. In other words, a yogi can distinguish the difference between these two, while a beginner cannot. Therefore, in the beginning it is indispensable to be 'remindful'. After all, rigpa has been caught up in sem, dualistic mind, from beginningless lifetimes. The essence has been lost in its expression“
As for conduct and Samaya, this also has to reflect one's level of actual realization. Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche again,

“Padmasambhava said: ‘Though the view should be as vast as the sky, keep your conduct as fine as barley flour.’ Don’t confuse one with the other. When training in the view, you can be as unbiased, as impartial, as vast, immense, and unlimited as the sky. Your behaviour, on the other hand, should be as careful as possible in discriminating what is beneficial or harmful, what is good or evil. One can combine the view and conduct, but don’t mix them or lose one in the other. That is very important

I think the main point is different people have different capacities at different times and there are many ways up a mountain. Going the long way round might seem silly to those who know all of the direct shortcuts but then some people might have very little chance of reaching the top or encountering these shortcuts without going the indirect way first.

this is the explanation for doubts about the purpose.
In countless past eons, 
since fortunate Atiyogins
with devotion to me, All-Creating Bodhi,
do not meditate a view, do not protect samayas,
do not engage in activities, do not progress on a path, 
do not train on stages, do not have cause and result, 
do not have relative and ultimate,
perceive there is nothing to meditate or accomplish, 
do not generate altruistic intentions, nor use antidotes,

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, but there is a difference between recognizing that and not recognizing that. The point that Dzogchen tantras consistently make is that practicing the two stages of creation and completion are at best an indirect means of coming to that recognition, and at worst a total deviation from the meaning of the Great Perfection. Rongzom points out that one should not discriminate between mantra or sūtra practice when it comes to the indirect approach. Recognition is the important point in Dzogchen, nothing else.

So now let us discuss sadhana practice as secondary practices.

Would you agree that ChNN's endorsement of sadhana practices as secondary is an endorsement of their value and validity in general? Would you also agree that your own position on the value of sadhana practices in general, even as secondary, is dismissive of their validity?

Malcolm wrote:
As for one, secondary practices are useful. As for your second question, no, I am not dismissive of their "validity" per se.

The point is that creation and completion stages practices do not form part of actual Dzogchen practice, regardless of whether mantra practices are an indirect means of realizing the meaning of Dzogchen teachings from the perspective that Mañjuśrimitra outlined.

The fact that Dzogchen practice as outlined in the Dzogchen tantras are not involved with the standard secret mantras methods of creation and completion should not be construed as a condemnation of such practices. Dzogchen simply does not make any great use of them. It does not mean they are bad, or that someone who is practicing Dzogchen should avoid them, if they have reason for their use. However, a practitioner of Dzogchen should understand that such practices are not the main point, and that the vehicles that promulgate cause and result with respect to buddhahood suffer from certain deviations with respect to Dzogchen, including anuyoga. Such practices in general are secondary primarily because the vehicles from which they spring have an incomplete understanding of the meaning of Dzogchen.

One does not need to get involved with those vehicles to practice Dzogchen. One can start out as Dzogchen practitioner, practice the path of Dzogchen, and realize the result of Dzogchen without reciting a single mantra or practicing a single sadhana from any of other five levels of tantra.

Of course, if someone is trained in what has come to be regarded as the "traditional" approach, typically one practices common and uncommon ngondro, three roots, and then enters the special preliminaries of Dzogpachenpo (hopefully, one will complete these before one becomes too old to practice actual Dzogchen practice). But this is not necessary, and never has been.

This not a question of "pure Dzogchen" as opposed to some other kind. This is a question of what those instructions that have come down to us in the tantras of and commentaries on the Kun byed rgyal po, etc., the Vajra bridge, etc., and the so called intimate instruction series actually say.

The point is to understand what the path of Atiyoga is, not the paths of Mahāyoga and Anuyoga which regard Atiyoga as some kind of result that is attained through a cause.

In a classroom setting I am the same way, but online I always found that odd because, first, we were learning that our personhood in general is an imputed fiction, and furthermore we were unlikely to ever meet each other. We were essentially anonymous anyway, even though we used our "real" names.

I think people tend to identify with their online personas just as they do their societal personages, and allow those identities to color their behavior. What’s more, trolls are trolls, whether anonymous or known, online or in person.

Avijñāpti is a dharma proposed by the Sarvastivadins and rejected by the Sautrantikas. It is a kind of matter that is created when one takes a vow. This means that vows create a physical state that cannot be perceived (avijñāpti). It is irrelevant to everyone above the level of Sarvastivada. But it is an interesting theory.

It is indeed a matter a lexicon...

It seems to me that modern Dzogchen oral traditions tends to "simplify" things a bit with Rigpa as a kind heuristic, that encompasses Rigpa, The Base, Dharmakaya etc...

While, as far as I can tell, in ancient Dzogchen texts and tradition, Rigpa has a precise meaning and definition, (tentatively paraphrased hereafter)
The recognition of the indivisible Empty-Clarity of the Base pointed out by the Guru.

Given these lexicon differences, what may sound even more shocking to modern ears yet while solving many pseudo-paradoxes and also emptying a lot of spiritual wanking " à l a you know who":
Not only is Rigpa "conditional" but it is also impermanent.
For the practionner on the path, the recognition of the ever-present Base is not ever-present itself. At the level of the Path (not the Base) moments of Recognition and distraction do alternate.
When this apparence has vanished, one has regained the Primordial Throne and one is a Buddha in actuality.

Sorry to nitpick at you, Vasana, but.........I think your first sentence is sufficient. The activity of accepting and rejecting are not the way towards stability, they are in fact obstructing it, as well as any idea of cultivation of merit or rejection of the negative.

Vasana said:
In terms of equipoise, then yes, accepting ,rejecting and reification is an obstruction. But in terms of going about your daily life you still need to know what conduct is acceptable and conducive for recognizing & stabilizing your recognition and what conduct harms it and is not conducive for recognizing & stabilizing your recognition.

This is why Guru Rinpoche says even if your view is as wide as the sky, attention towards action, cause and effect should be as fine as flour. If you went about your day in a state of ma-rigpa, doing whatever you pleased, you might be beyond accepting and rejecting by deed, but that won't be coming from a place of understanding unless you're actually in a state of knowledge at that time of committing any given action.

The dharmakāya is encountered in the instructions.
Vimalamitra states:
Sentient beings experience samsara, cycling within it again and again. Although they abide in samsara, they have never seen the characteristic of samsara because they lack the instruction of a guru.
And:
As such, the nature of vidyā pervades all migrating beings, but they do not understand the instructions of the guru for encountering the dharmakāya in direct perception.
So, you are free to do as you please, but Dzogchen yogis rely on the intimate instructions of their guru.

/magnus

Malcolm wrote:
The Tantra Without Syllables states:
Since the appearance of vidyā is intrinsically perfect,
I do not assert the two accumulations of syllables.
The Blossoming Lotus commentary on this passage by Vimalamitra states:
Everything is perfect within the appearances of vidyā itself. Since [the appearance of vidyā] is intrinsic, it is perfect. Asserting the two accumulations of merit and [pristine consciousness] as the cause of awakening is a deviation— not realizing the meaning of Ati which is free from accomplishment through effort. Within the reality of Ati, the two accumulations of merit (the cause) and pristine consciousness (the result) are not asserted in my self-originated vidyā.
With respect to the creation stage, it says:
Since there is neither emanating nor gathering in me,
the meanings of syllables are totally perfect.
Vimalamitra comments:
Since there is no effort of emanating and collecting the assembly of syllables in my self-liberated appearance, there is no need for a creation stage, like the syllables. The way the syllables located in the ultimate natural nāḍīs are totally perfect is that Samantabhadra father and mother abide within the balls of light, perfect like oil in a small seed—the deities that do not need to be created are innate attributes.
Further:
Since there is no cause in vidyā itself,
where can there be a generation stage syllable?
Vimala comments:
There is no connate cause in vidyā. Since it has always self-appeared without being created by a cause, there is no need in the present to generate that [appearance]. Since it has always been intrinsically complete, where can there be a generation stage seed syllable? Since that is not understood, outer and inner mantra from Mahāyoga on down are deviations.
Further:
Since pristine consciousness and the five kāyas are intrinsically complete,
there is also no A of the completion stage.
Vimala states:
Since pristine consciousness and the five kāyas are complete as innate attributes in vidyā itself, they have always existed. Since the completion stage that depends on the syllables of outer and inner Secret Mantra (based on the syllable A and so on) is a deviation, it also does not exist in Ati.
Vimala also mentions possible deviations within Ati:
Since Mahāyoga Tantra asserts that the outer universe is the celestial mansion and the inhabitants are deities in the utterly pure relative based on words, it deviates from the transcendent state of the self-liberation of the appearances of the six relaxed senses.

Since Anuyoga Tantra asserts the dhātu and pristine consciousness as ultimate based on words, it deviates from the meaning of making the result of Ati Yoga (the sole, unique bindu) into the path, the absolute perfection in which nothing is abandoned.

Furthermore, the proponents of Ati who assert words that are approximations deviate by: 1) leaving the view in the basis, 2) leaving meditation as the mode of the arising of qualities, 3) leaving experience in syllables, 4) leaving conduct in reality, 5) leaving everything as being the mind, and 6) asserting the potentiality and play of appearances as ultimate. Since all of these proponents lack experience, they deviate by grasping a view and meditation of intellectual analysis. As such, because of being free from these assertions of words, there is no emanation and withdrawal. As vidyā itself is not within the range of wisdom (prajñā), it is confirmed as a direct perception which is beyond intellectual analysis. 

Since with the three critical points one abides together with the nonarising dharmatā, there is no need for the activities of hearing, reflection, and meditation. Likewise, there is no distinction between sharpness or dullness in capacity.

Since the experience itself is approached in the self-appearance, the extreme of doubt is eliminated. Since there is freedom from benefit or harm in gathering accumulations or misdeeds, and since this can be immediately applied in experience, vidyā is beyond virtues or misdeeds. In this way, since appearances are liberated directly, there is no great hope for some other antidote. Since the meaning of inexpressibility is experienced on the basis of one’s own voice, those who are beyond words and expressions are those of the unmistaken Atiyoga which is beyond a ground of deviation. Since Ati does not fall into any sort of a ground of deviation, those who assert other designations with words and syllables are explained to be those who deviate.

I've read this thread with interest over the past days, and thank each poster for adding their perspective. Since the primordial Buddha spontaneously manifests as teacher and disciples, I thought the relative practices were aspects of compassion. Due to lack of merit and conceptual obscurations sentient beings don't recognize the natural state, so they need some help. I think Milarepa didn't get it immediately either, so people who need purification and accumulation are in good company. Looking at the state of most people on Earth today, I think teachings on ethics are most compassionate. So many people headed to a burning hell, preta realm or animal it's truly sad.

I think the distinction to be made is that 'creation stage' is also used in other contexts as a descriptive term for a characteristic of [knowing] reality and experience, not purely just the method.

Apart from the explanations of creation stage Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche that I think Cone, Magnus and others already shared, Thrangu Rinpoche's commentary on the mind instructions of Khenpo Gangshar says something similar;
While in that state, your body is left to itself without fabrication, free and easy. 
That is the body of all the victorious ones. 
That is the essence of the creation stage.

[...]When we see the essence of the mind, are we at that point actually doing the creation stage of visualizing a deity? We are not, but the essence of the creation stage is the realization of the nature of all phenomena as they are. That is why this practice is the essence of the creation stage and why this is the body of all the victorious ones, even though we are not doing anything in particular with our body other than just letting it rest and relax. These are the benefits for the body.

There are indeed many profound practices that relate to creation stage, and related to completion stage with signs.

Whether one is practicing the stages of creation and completion or not; whether one successfully practices or not If one applies oneself--in the end, there is nothing within the limit of our experience which is beyond the stages of creation and completion.

Gyurme Kundrol said:
If this came from HH Getse Rinpoche I doubt he means that Dzogchen is somehow within the limits of this, or that Dzogchen is somehow bound to this.

Having heard him teach I can say that he definitely has taught at least one time that Dzogchen can be practiced in itself, by itself, by people who have no special requisites beforehand like Ngondro or mantra recitations and without involvement in creation and completion stage practice as a necessity for engaging Dzogchen. He never said of course that people shouldnt practice, he did nothing but encourage people to be humble and practice and generally said its a good idea to practice, but never said it is a must.

conebeckham said:
Again, I am not arguing method, per se, but looking at experience from the POV of a Two Stages model.  If you feel that Dzogchen is somehow outside the limit of the Two Stages, not as method, but as experience, you are in a sense arguing that the result of the Two Stages, or the "fruition," if you want look at this from a gradualist perspective, differs from the completely stable Dzogchen
I obviously have no way in which to know his true meaning and lack his ability in Dharma in every respect, but if I had to guess at a meaning here I would think he meant that since all phenomena arise from the same ground from which either the phenomena of Samsara or Nirvana arise, nothing we do, whether we succeed or not in doing it, moves from that ground. Creation and completion stage also never move from this- what one might call "the limits of our experience". In this sense experience refers to knowable phenomena and limits refers to the full range of that phenomena from the peak of mundane existence all the way to the grossest appearance of a physical body, all of which can be reified by conceptual mind and bifurcated as either the states of Samsara or Nirvana, all of which can be clung to and can act as a basis for generating karma. Unlike ultimate reality which falls outside of what you might call "limited" and "experience", since the nature of ultimate reality is endowed with the seven vajra qualities like immutability, indestructibility and so forth it is not really limited, and since it falls outside being part of the conceptual realm it is beyond experience. Ultimately all appearing phenomena are in the stage of "creation" and all dissolving phenomena are in the stage of "completion" and this is all thats ever been happening, willed or not, intentional or not, successful or not. All appearing phenomena never move from the space of ones own primordial awareness and so whether there is the appearance of a deity or of a cigarette butt, in either case its a self appearing, self arisen phenomena that is arising, abiding, and dissolving in the same way that all other knowable phenomena have always been doing.
I understand the meaning to be something like this, yes.   The only question I would ask is regarding your assertion, or assumption, that all "experience" is within the conceptual realm.  Certainly we reify experiences in conceptual thought.

But then is it of no importance whether there are Compassionate action to relieve the pain of a fellow? We see how the Bodhisattvas act for the welfare of all in simple ways, as helping them out of samsara as much as possible. How Buddhahood can be realized without trying/wishing to help fellows, not to leave them "alone" in dispair or distress of samsara?

Help is possible when the obscurations aren't, when perfect perception is, right? The Kindness of such help, we receive, is just incredible amazing!

Though there is a distinction made between these two, I'm not sure I actually understand the difference when it comes down to it. I'm particularly referring to "pure visions", which are often said to be received from deities (as opposed to something that was necessarily hidden by Padmasambhava to be found later), and they contain a practice (as opposed to someone just seeing a deity for example).

When I look at the lineages of early tantras, that are not considered termas, it appears the same way, e.g. something like: A primordial Buddha, to some Bodhisattva or deity, eventually to some historical human and so on.

Assuming neither have an unbroken oral lineage from Shakyamuni Buddha, they basically seem like the same thing. So other than their age, lineage, or possibly size... is there actually a difference?

Yes, there are some people, who because they have some understanding of emptiness, make this kind of mistake. However, this is not what I am talking about.

dzogchungpa said:
The following passage from ChNN's commentary on Longchenpa's "Advice From The Heart" seems relevant:
The Fifteenth Word of Advice

Proffering mindless talk on emptiness and disregarding cause and effect, 
You may think that non-action is the ultimate point of the Teaching; 
Yet to abandon the two accumulations will destroy the good fortune of spiritual practice. 
Integrate them both! This is my advice from the heart.

Some people who have only an intellectual understanding think that emptiness is the real nature of everything and say, ‘Everything is empty, so it does not matter whether we do good or bad’. Saying this, they disregard the relative level, the relationship between cause and effect. There are many people who have this attitude. Among the followers of Dzogchen many think that this teaching requires no limitations, and that they are free to do anything they like, and they actually live out that idea. However, this attitude amounts to disrespect toward the relationship of cause and effect. Why? We are not always in a state of emptiness; we simply have a knowledge of emptiness. We know with our intellect that everything is empty, but in reality, we eat and sleep and so on, and all these actions occur in the relative condition. In the relative condition we must give the proper consideration to the relationship between cause and effect. Disregarding that will bring many unwanted consequences for our future.

Moreover, in the Dzogchen teachings it is said that when one dwells in instant presence, in the continuation of that state, one does not need any effort nor any concepts. To apply effort or to harbor concepts at that time would be negative. For that reason, Dzogchen speaks of there being ‘nothing to do’ or ‘non-action’. This is different from thinking of oneself as a Dzogchen practitioner simply because one has an understanding that all is empty. That is just intellectual knowledge, and, on the pretext of that knowledge, believing that one is in a state of Dzogchen, one neglects the two accumulations of wisdom and merit.

Accumulation of merit means performing good actions—for example, cleaning the temple, placing flowers or lights before the statues of the buddhas, making various offerings, helping the poor people we meet. With these actions we accumulate merit.

Accumulation or increase of wisdom means, when time permits it, staying in a calm state or, if we have knowledge of our real nature, developing that knowledge. If we do not apply these two accumulations, our spiritual practice will not unfold in a perfect way. Thus, Longchenpa advises us that the relative condition and contemplation must not be separated but should go together. When we notice that we are not in a state of contemplation, we should try to make the best of the relative condition we are in.

Like someone said earlier, unless you're non-distracted  in Rigpa, or the natural state in any given moment, you're in ma-Rigpa. If you're distracted and in ma-Rigpa, you might as well be enacting the liberative karmas that aren't extinguished until complete Buddhahood. If we're not in the natural state or generating conditioned virtue, the chances are we're fostering distraction and negative acts. I get that on the one hand, these aren't causal realizations , but we have our relative condition of body speech and mind that can be influenced positively or negatively while on the path which can't be separated from the stabilisation of the meditation/result.

The whole subject in all its nuances has been done to death in the scholarly literature by people who can read Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese, and if you are really interested in the subject, you might start by reading some of that, because, as you are aware, internet posters on the subject generally have an axe to grind, and discussions usually dissolve into self-justifying polemics very quickly.

What I had gathered from the standard accounts of the debate was that Hashang's view was based on the path of renuciation and hence, from a Tibetan Buddhist-perspective less profound than a Tantric perspective (path of transformation). Do I interpret you correctly if I say that Hashang's view was actually a part of/or closer to the path of self-liberation(Great Perfection)?

The primary difference, practically speaking, is that Kamalashila's method is to meditate the two truths alternately; Hashangs method is to meditate them simultaneously. Nubchen states that the former is based on provisional sutras; the latter, definitive sutras.  Nubchen further clarifies that while mahayoga is gradual, since it possesses direct introduction it is actually more rapid than Chan. But because it's view is causal it is inferior to the approach of Dzogchen.

Let's face it:  very few people "get it" during direct introduction and of those that "get it" even fewer still can stabilise it.  That means that Dzogchen essentially becomes a doorway into Vajrayana Yoga practice as the student requires something to stop them slipping into further delusion.  The two accumulations are that "something".  They teach the two accumulations out of compassion for their students.

Nothing strange about that.

If you read the signature at the bottom of all my posts you'll see that everything I write always has a disclaimer.

Of course that includes Nyingmapas, hence my disagreement with Malcolm's dismissiveness.

Think of it this way; what if I was dismissive of all Kagyu lamas except Trungpa? There are many people that feel that way. None of them happen to post here.

As for my opinion about Tibetan Buddhism's moribund state of development, it is a sentiment I have expressed many times before. There hasn't been a single interesting development in the intellectual history of Tibetan Buddhism since the 15th century. Since the 15th century, the intellectual history of Tibetan Buddhism has been one merely of institutional consolidation, money, and power. This should not be construed as an argument that there have been no interesting authors, teachers and so on. It is a statement that even despite the fact that there have most certainly been interesting authors since the 15th century, ( Ganden Chophel comes to mind) and doubtlessly, realized masters, there has been virtually no development in the intellectual history of Tibetan Buddhism.

ChNN's chief role has been the experiential revival of Dzogchen traditions that had fallen into obscurity, as well as opening the West to the broad range of the teachings of the Great Perfection and the ancient pre-modern Nyingma tradition — not just Yeshe Lama and texts like it that form the main body of what Tibetans practice as Dzogchen in the present day.

In Tibet, of course, we had my teacher, the late Khenpo Jigme Phuntsog, who is perhaps one of the pre-eminent interpreters of Longchenpas ouvre; Khenpo Munsel and his students, who took great pains to gather and publish all he could find of obscure Nyingma texts and publish them in what we call "The Very Large Kama"; Dudjom Rinpoche before him who edited whatever he could find into what we call the "Large Kama."

And, BTW, I never called ChNN an "outlier" — that is a term you have insisted on introducing the conversation in your quixotic attempt to explain tradition of which you have little understanding (for example, your silly attempt to force gzhan stong down everyone's throat as "orthodox Nyingma view."). In other words, my friend, you really have no idea what you are talking about. But I am sure that my admonition will not prevent you from continuing to share with us the effluvia of misguided logorrhea to which you are prone when it comes to the subject of the Nyingma school.

Malcolm wrote:
No, Greg. That is fake news. What I mean by modern Nyingma is the rise of the Nyingma school in general as an institutional entity. This happened in the 17th century. Prior to this, Nyingma had only one major monastic institution founded by Phagmo Drupa's younger brother, Dampa Desheg, in Eastern Tibet during the 12th century, and expanded in 1656.

Dorje Drag in 1659, and Mindroling in 1676 were established under the patronage of the Fifth Dalai Lama; Palyul was founded in 1665; Dzogchen in 1685 and Shechen, in 1735.

Basically, prior to the 17th century, Nyingma had no major institutions, unlike Sakya, Kagyu and Gelug, Jonang, or even Bon. Prior to this Nyingma persisted primarily in family lineages and on the fringes of other monastic institutions.

The person who benefitted the Nyingmapas the most, as can be seen from the above, was the Fifth Dalai Lama. He was responsible for the rise of modern Nyingma.

This has both positive and negative aspects. The positive aspect is that of course Nyingma received major funding and patronage.

The negative aspect is that by the 19th century, Nyingma had lost much of its iconoclastic flavor and has come to resemble the Sarma schools far more than it is different from them. I consider this the Kadampafication of Nyingma (and of course, we will all recall Milarepa was no fan of the Kadamapas, calling Dromton a demon who had crippled the Dharma in Tibet because of his control over Atisha).

Indeed, one of the reasons Longchenpa became so popular, apart from his systematization of the Great Perfection literature of the Nyinthig, is that after lingering in total obscurity for nearly three hundred years, as a result of his Sakya/Kadampa education, he had created an amazing graduated curriculum in the Sems nyid ngal so cycle. This has become the basis for the institutional presentation of Nyingma teachings today, especially as a result of the revival of his popularity by Jigme Lingpa. Ironically, Longchenpa himself was no fan of gradualism in a real sense, writing in defense of Hashang Mahāyāna. Longchenpa also largely remained aloof from the polemical battles that later Nyingmapas waded into with gusto in the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries.

The adoption Sakya, Gelug, or Kagyu monastic curricula in these monasteries has also impacted Nyingma in the sense that modern Nyingmapas are trained in a lam rim curriculum heavily influenced by the Kadampa school. Hence, I distinguish modern Nyingma from the wilder, woolier, more interesting, and more heterodox Nyingma of Nubchen, Rongzom, early Nyingthig and other earlier trends of the Great Perfection. You really have no idea how much early Nyingma ideas completely contradict the modern, institutionally-sanitized, homogenized, intellectually-moribund Tibetan Buddhism we see at present.

We can see an encroaching homogenization of Nyingma which really begins during 17tn century, once the Nyingmapas began to have a coherent institutional stake in the Tibetan games of power, prestige and influence.

I have to say Greg, for an Anarchist, you certainly are a staunch supporter of the religious hierarchy of Tibetan Buddhism.

Not at all. Mila had ten Nyingma gurus before he met Marpa. I think the account of Mila meeting with Rongton is clearly a political story meant to denigrate Dzogchen teachings, reflective of the uncertainty about Dzogchen among Tibetans because of various log sngags sun phyung texts in circulation at that time influential in Kadampa circles. In fact Mila received Dzogchen teachings from at least two teachers.

Also keep in mind that Mila is universally regarded as an emanation of Mañjuśrīmitra in Kagyu.

Ah that makes sense.

A little more if you'll indulge me, I am trying to get a better grip on the different presentations of kun gzhi in Dzogchen.

Okay in the man ngag sde system, the gzhi is a set of generic qualities of an individual consciousness. When the neutral awareness latent in this is ignorant of the gzhi's true condition, it stirs the vayu which in turn leads to the arising of the kun gzhi, and from there to the kun gzhi rnam shes and so forth. Assuming I have that right, it is the kun gzhi that is the repository of traces (or is it the kun gzhi rnam shes or both)? Furthermore since here kun gzhi basically equates to ignorance, it indeed dissolves upon realization?

Malcolm wrote:
In man ngag lde, the kun zhi is another name for mind, and is distinct from the gzhi. Bonpo texts do not seem to make a distinction between gzhi and kun gzhi, at least not in the ZZNG. In ZZNG, kun gzhi is equated with byang chub sems. For example, the the ZZNG the kun gzhi is defined as having the nature of the three kāyas.

In the Rig pa rang shar, however, those who identify the kun gzhi as dharmakāya are strongly negated.

So there is a difference in terminology, with ZZNG using kun gzhi where man ngag sde uses gzhi.

In other words if a Buddha is teaching Dharma, a Christian will hear the gospels and a Muslim, the Koran.

And for that many years there was no evolution or change in terms of human consciousness(intelligence), merits,  etc.?

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddhist point of view is that at the beginning of the Mahābrahma eon,  lifespans could not be counted. As the merit of beings decline and afflictions increase, the lifespan drops to 10,000,000 years, then to 100,000, 80,000, 70,000, 60,000, 10,000, 5,000, 1000, 500, 300 and finally 100 years, our present age.

So basically, the Buddhist account is one of continued degeneration, and things will get worse from here on out. There is another point, which is that based on certain conditions, according to Dzogchen tantras, the length of the Buddha's teachings in Jambudvipa itself are divided into three periods which last a total of 15 million years. During the first period, the primary mode of practice is making offerings to the images of the buddhas and so on. This period, called the period of the doctrine of the body, lasts 7.5 million years. The period of the doctrine of speech lasts five million years, and during this time, recitation and deity yoga are the main practices to follow. In the final 2.5 million years, the doctrine of mind, only samadhi is effective. The four yugas last 3,456,000 years. Thus, it could be argued that, from a Dzogchen point of view, at this time only samadhi is an effective means of liberation.

The Buddhist system of understanding the Kāli Yuga is found in the Saddharmasmṛty-upasthāna Sūtra. It is defined by the lifespan of human beings:
In the Kāli Yuga, the very longest lifespan of human beings in Jambudvipa is one hundred years.
In the Kālacakra commentary, Padmani-nāma-pañjikā, the Kāli Yuga is characterized by the five degenerations:
The so called "Kāli Yuga" is the time of the five degenerations.


And:
Through the power of the Kāli Yuga, the life span of human beings is one hundred years.
The Madhyamaka commentary, Saṃskṛtāsaṃskṛtaviniścaya states:
A long time after the parinirvana of Krakucchanda, at the end of the Kāli Yuga, our teacher, the Tathāgata called Śākyamuni arose in the world.
Finally, the Amarakoṣaṭīkākāmadhenu states the Kāli Yuga lasts 432,000 human years. We are at the end of the that period of time, according to all Buddhist sources.

What then is the most important thing here? It is to pray to the teacher with such devotion that we see him as a Buddha. If we do so, the wisdom of realization will take birth in our minds.

With that being said, I also agree with Magnus in that these practices can be best approached if you've already discovered the natural state. Sometimes it's seen as a deviation to practice in that way, where as at other times and for other people, they can be a useful method for making the mind and voice 'supple' enough to stabilize the natural state more readily.

What I am also saying is that sadhanas and so on are not part of the main practices taught in the three series of Dzogchen. And as Florin rightly notes, those who think one can approach the Great Perfection through mahāyoga and anuyoga have a flawed perspective.

If one is going to take the indirect approach, it has to be done as Mipham clarifies:
If one meditates generating the thought that the [three] samadhis and the [four] mudras are dharmatā and therefore are not different, the ultimate awakened mind will arise. If one actualizes the meditation, one realizes that all phenomena do not exist apart from one’s mind. The accumulations are gathered and obscurations are purified because of that meditation. One becomes realized because one’s continuum is blessed by the deity of pristine consciousness.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course not. The main Dzogchen practice is the direct perception of your own state. Even guru yoga is a practice that works with mind, rather than pristine consciousness -- even Ati guru yoga. Thus, guru yoga is a method related to the second phrase of Garab Dorje, "decide one thing/remain without doubt." One uses guru yoga, or rushan, etc., to introduce oneself to the mind essence over and over as many times as one needs until one has attained some stability in recognizing it and sustaining that recognition.

Once you have "decided on one thing/no longer remain in doubt", then you do not remain passive, you shift your focus to "continue in the confidence of liberation/continue in that state," relying principally on the primary methods of the Great Perfection found in so called "man ngag lde," trekchö and thögal.

If your practice centers around this recognition how could it possibly be a deviation no matter what Yana it formally belongs to?

If your practice centers around this recognition, what else could you possibly need to do? What guru yoga, deity practice, and so on can surpass that point?

For example, of someone claims they are a Jungian analyst, but instead is practicing DBT and calling it Jungian analysis, one would call it blameworthy. Likewise, if someone is claiming to teach Dzogchen, but instead they teach the methods of Mahā and Anuyoga and call this "Dzogchen," one should call it blameworthy. Most Nyingma teachers do not do this. But there are some who do, and one should be aware that the situation these days is similar to merchants who show beef, but sell horse meat instead. Finally, just because some sadhana has really pretty Dzogchen words like "ka dag," "lhun grub," etc., does not mean that sadhana actually belongs to Dzogchen teachings. A case in point is the Chetsun Nyingthig. The Chetsun Nyingthig's actual Dzogchen instructions are included only in a very short section at the very end of the root text. The rest of it is devoted to discussing the empowerment, the ngondro practice, the sadhana of Chetsun, and so on. It is a wonderful practice, excellent in every way. But when you are practicing some sadhana reciting mantras, you are practicing the two stages, not Dzogchen. This does not mean the Chetsun Nyinthig sucks, does not have blessings (whatever that means) and so on. It means that in that system, when you have finished the two stages connected with the practice of Chetsun, then you move on to actual Dzogchen preliminaries and the main practice of Dzogchen. The main emphasis of the Chetsun Nyingthig is the Guru Yoga of Vimalamitra. It is very profound. But the main practice of Dzogchen is more profound, as Vimalamitra would agree.

My point is simply that people should have a very clear, formal understanding of the differences between this and that yāna, so they know what they are doing any why. This is the reason why there is a detailed discussion of the nine yānas.

Some people like to follow the modern Nyingma system. I prefer to follow Garab Dorje. We are all free to do as we like.

Purification practices have their place.I will say however that Dudjom Tersar Ngondro, Longchen Nyingthig Ngondro, the "Semde" Ngondro by Sogdogpa Lodo Gyaltsenn, etc. are not Dzogchen practice, per se.  These are elaborate Guru Yogas based in Mahāyoga, since one takes the four empowerments. There is absolutely no difference between practicing the "tantric" ngondro of one school and that of another school apart from lineage.

To use another example, from the time of Dzeng Dharmabodhi, the practice of Heruka Ngondzog Gyalpo has been associated with the so called Longde teachings. But no one thinks practicing Ngondzog Gyalpo's sadhana is Longde practice, even if, in order to be introduced to Longde teachings this empowerment is indispensible since this is how the transmission of Longde has been passed on since the time of Dzeng. But before Dzeng, it was not the case that Longde was ever associated with any practice belonging to the two stages. And even if one receives this empowerment, there is no reason to practice that sadhana unless you are planning to give the empowerment yourself, apart from the Guru Yoga practice as a preliminary.

Dudjom Tersar Ngondro is just fine, it is just not Dzogchen Ngondro. That is something else, very precise and specific.

Pretty simple, it means that the two obscurations have a coarse aspect and a subtle aspect.

Eliminating the course aspect of the afflictive obscuration means that one will not take rebirth in any of the three lower realms, nor outside of Dharma families and so on.

The subtle aspect of the afflictive obscuration means that one will still be subject to afflictions, but markedly less so than other ordinary people.

Eliminating the coarse aspect of the knowledge obscuration means that one will begin to manifest the six clairvoyances, find it very easy to understand difficult Dharma topics and so forth.

The subtle aspect of the knowledge obscuration means that one will still be subject to innate self-grasping, will lack the two omnisciences and so on.

What Khenpo Ngachung is stating is that these coarse obscurations cannot be eliminated by those who have not acheived the path of seeing of the lesser vehicles.

If someone rejects practice telling others that it will somehow hold them back, implying that practice is somehow "harming" them, then they are not really holding the authentic view of Dzogchen in my opinion. In that view there are no sentient beings, so where is all this concern coming from regarding what other people are doing? What kind of realized Dzogchenpa who is in Rigpa 24/7 conjures up this delusion of beings practicing and this dualistic notion that they should or shouldnt do those things? Its absurd to claim to be an advanced practitioner who is beyond all this then turn around and engage in acceptance of one thing and rejection of another, taking positions of what is good or bad, high or low. Its a sure sign that we should not listen to people who talk like this and should instead listen to whatever our Guru has taught us.


Malcolm wrote:
The dichotomy you appear to be setting up is that if a Dzogchen practitioner is not a first stage bodhisattva and beyond, then somehow they need to be practicing sadhanas, generating merits, and so on, as in the lower vehicles. But this is not the case.

Put in terms of the five paths and ten stages: an ordinary person who practices the Great Perfection can eradicate the coarse aspect of the two obscurations even while they have not realized (what is understood in lower vehicles as) the path of seeing, the direct realization of emptiness. This is a special point of the superiority of the Great Perfection teachings. In the eight lower vehicles, it is impossible to eradicate the coarse aspect of the two obscurations below the path of seeing. People who doubt my assertion need to read the works of Khenpo Ngachung.

If one understands the significance of the luminosity of one’s mind through a direct perception,
the rhetoric of scholars is not necessary here;

there  is no need for an explanation of the taste of sugar.
Without understanding this, even a paṇḍita will be deluded.

As the armed forces are under the control of the civilian government, they are supposed to be driven by our political body, the Congress. Only the Congress has the right to declare war. The executive branch has limited abilities to use the military in the case of attacks by other countries, but does not have the right to declare war [hence most of the so called "war on terror" is based on the latter idea].

The people in the Pentagon as well as the Intelligence Services are generally quite highly educated. For example, the Pentagon has accepted human-driven climate change for decades, irrespective of the deluded opinions of the flat-earthers presently in the White House and the GOP in general. So yes, in matters of military goals and strategies, I generally think when it comes to defense of the US, they do a pretty good job. When there are screwups like the Iraq Invasion, it is not on the military, it is on the civilian government. In my opinion, in a direct democracy campaign US citizens would have overwhelmingly made the choice to invade both Iraq and Afghanistan. So, again, in my opinion, the Congress acted out the will of the people in those two wars, as foolish as they were.

There are many systems of calculation in Tibetan Buddhism. One is derived from Kalacakra, this is used mainly for calendar-making, it also has a version of horary and natal astrology, but Tibetans do not use it much.
Another is derived from the Sarvodaya Tantra, it is very complicated, and never received much attention.

The third is the system of 'byung rtsi or n ag rtsi elemental calculation. It is derived from the treasures concealed by one Chinese master, Du har Nag po (hence the name nag rtsi ) and discovered and translated in the 11th century by one Kham pa Khra mo. This system is very connected with the system of apotropaic rites known under the Rubric of Gto. While Tibetan "Astrology" contains as a whole contains elements from all three of these systems, in general it is the third upon which Tibeatans most rely.

Since sentient beings are as infinite as space, the Buddha's compassionate teachings are also infinite, but can be categorized into 84,000 kinds depending on beings' needs. I would guess that those who see no need for the lower teachings are usually those who need them the most.

One thing I find kinda funny is that it is said that for practitioners of the highest faculty, the title of a teaching is enough to intuit the full meaning. The rest of the explanation, then, is for those that didn't "get it" and need further help. So, are the highest teachings spelled out for the slow pokes who just couldn't get to the other shore from madhyamaka, bodhicitta, or the 4 noble truths for that matter?

I'm a very basic practitioner, but I always thought the goal was to practice the 9 yanas simultaneously. Like, keeping the highest view but still minding your Ps and Qs.

Malcolm wrote:
Each of the nine yānas is in independent, self-sufficient vehicle. Otherwise, there is no point in calling them individual "vehicles."

The actual name is Theg pa rim dgu, the nine progressive vehicles. The implication of this however is not that one learns for example, śrāvakayāna, then one moves on to pratyekabuddhayāna, etc. The intention of this is that higher vehicles embrace the intention of the lower vehicles. Thus, if you have been introduced to Dzogchen teachings, there is no need to practice common Mahāyāna since the intention of common Mahāyāna is fully included in the vehicle of Atiyoga. It is not the case however that the lower vehicles can encompass the higher vehicles, because the view and practice of the nine progressive vehicles moves from lower to higher. It is generally regarded as a downfall to prefer to practice a lower vehicle having been introduced to the practices of a higher vehicle: for example, preferring to observe one's pratimokśa vows rather than breaking them to benefit another according to Mahāyāna vows.

I could have just as easily posted this in the Zen section due to the parallels involved, I remember thinking same thing when I practiced Zen, but figured this was better here.

So something I've run into in my Dharma experiences, a kind of clash of personality types among practitioners that gets me wondering:

An attitude you find in practice groups among some folks goes something like this: "You don't need [Common Mahayana/ prayers/ Sutra/ Tantra etc.], all you need is [Zazen/ Shikantanza/ abiding in Rigpa] man".

This sort of approach has always seemed sophomoric to me, as I have my doubts that anyone can be anything like a "pure" practitioner that makes no use of "lower" teachings. Or at least, it seems like such people are exceedingly rare.

It sometimes feels to me like in our culture this approach risks turning into a Dharmic form of anti-intellectualism, and is often accompanied by "dude you can't learn Dharma from a book" (which while true in many ways, is sort of beside the point, and devalues scholarship and study). Am I just being paranoid, is it just my quirks and pet peeves, or is this a real trend that others have observed?

I mean, I get that one should not cling to or be conditioned by practices, that intellectual knowledge is provisional etc.. but I seem to run into the opposite sometimes - people who seem to reject "lower" practices altogether in favor of a sometimes rigid, sort of  protestant approach where any "lower" practice requiring what is viewed as effort are frowned upon. Sometimes the value of studying or knowing Dharma subjects at all is questioned.

Boomerang said:
So when a person on Dharmawheel says they practice Dzogchen they are openly claiming that vidyā is their yidam, and this doesn't break vows of secrecy like it would in Mahayoga or Highest Yoga Tantra? Is it only harmful when you talk about Dzogchen with the wrong person, such as a person with no interest in dharma?

Coincidentally, one of the aforementioned biographies was of your late guru, Yeshe Dorje Rinpoche. I wonder if the circumstances regarding secrecy were different or him, since he was constantly revealing his attainments by doing his job. What do you think?

Two other gurus who openly talk about deities they practice are Garchen Rinpoche and Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche. Is this a subtle way of saying, "I have attained siddhi, so there's nothing for me to lose by revealing this?" Or maybe it's okay for them to reveal those yidams because they aren't the main yidam?

Malcolm wrote:
Anytime you take an empowerment, you are making a commitment to that method of practice from now until awakening. That is essentially what a yidam is, i.e., a commitment to the path of awakening. The whole idea of "special yidams" is a bit of quasi theistic superstition. It does not matter who anyone's yidam is since the continuum of pristine consciousness of all yidams is the same.

People have karmic relations with this or that practice. But in reality, everyone in Mahāyāna has the same yidam: buddhahood.

I must say, I had an excellent education at Uni of Sydney. When I finished the Buddhist Studies degree, the address given at my Graduation Ceremony was on the theme of 'an unexamined life is not worth living'. It captured so many excellent points about a true liberal arts education and the ability to think for oneself.

(The subjects I have studied have never really been directly relevant to my means of livelihood - in fact that is an major issue in some ways - but on the other hand, I've gained an understanding that I never would have done had I studied law or medicine, which is what my family background would have suggested.)

I think one of the obvious problems of Western culture, generally, is nihilism - the death of meaning, community, a sense of relatedness to those around you and the cosmos. I think many people are dying of loneliness and meaninglessness.

Since there are no phenomena that are not one’s mind, the diversity [as mind] is the mind series. The sole intent of these [texts] is to refute that the mind is anything other than the self-originated pristine consciousness.

The study does not support your thesis that this is a result of the failure of feminism. The study specifically states that "Rather than immediately inferring that the women’s movement failed to improve the lot of women, we conclude with a simple taxonomy for organizing alternative explanations of this paradox."

They then address the issue of feminism in a nuanced fashion, "Finally, the changes brought about through the women’s movement may have decreased women’s happiness. The increased opportunity to succeed in many dimensions may have led to an increased likelihood of believing that one’s life is not measuring up. Similarly, women may now compare their lives to a broader group, including men, and find their lives more likely to come up short in this assessment. Or women may simply find the complexity and increased pressure in their modern lives to have come at the cost of happiness."

It also says, "It has been recognized that an individual’s assessment of their well-being may reflect the social desirability of responses and Kahneman (1999) argues that people in good circumstances may be hedonically better off than people in worse circumstances, yet they may require more to declare themselves happy. In the context of the findings presented in this paper, women may now feel more comfortable being honest about their true happiness and have thus deflated their previously inflated responses."

But quite frankly, not a single one of the woman that I know would dream of trading in their independence and so on for some putative happiness that exists on TV in Ozzie and Harriet land.

After all, as Karmapa Rangjung Dorje said, "even the Buddhas do not see it."

Tsongkhapafan said:
Why would experiencing the conventional nature of the mind lead to an experience of emptiness? Our mind is obscured and we perceive all phenomena as inherently existent including the mind. Without specific meditation on emptiness you will never perceive the empty nature of things and you certainly won't simply by focusing on conventional truths.

conebeckham said:
Who said anything about meditating on conventional nature of mind? Not me.   Not the Dohas or Upadeshas, really, either. That is your own fabricated conclusion.  I don't think you read the  Upadesha from Tilopa, because you would not mistake the object if you had read it, and the commentary by Khenchen Thrangu Rinpoche.

I do wish you would read outside your own ghost-written tradition, with an attempt to be open-minded and with no tortured attempts to turn words and meaning to your purpose.  It's transparent and intellectually dishonest.

Nowhere in the upadesha, nor in any of the quotes I have provided in this thread, does anyone suggest "conventional mind" to equate with primordial awareness.  If you assert that "Nature of Mind," the empty yet cognizant awareness which is nonconceptual and without beginning or end, is conventional, please provide sources from sutra, Tantra, or upadesha to support this assertion.  Frankly, every quote and every source provided thus far, and every Doha and pith instruction any of us could trot out in future, contradicts your position when read plainly without superimposition or needless twisting.

You can continue to parrot your dogma to the end of time and you will still have no idea what the Mahasiddhas are talking about in their pith instructions. You've gotten in your own way.  I cannot say it more plainly.  Go read and contemplate the Ganges Mahamudra Upadesha Tilopa spoke to Naropa, and read the commentary from the master, Thrangu Rinpoche,  it is a gift--do not throw it away carelessly or break it.

Tsongkhapafan said:
Actually, it really isn't. The Sambhogakaya arises from the Dharmakaya and the Nirmanakaya emerges from the Sambhogakaya due to having trained in the three bringings of generation and completion stage; in other words, the two stages. Do you think this happens automatically? If there is no motivation, no love, no great compassion, no bodhichitta, no three bringings, none of this will happen automatically. You can't build a house without a solid foundation.

How many stages are you missing out? renunciation? Bodhichitta? Correct view of emptiness?

Don't be in too much of a rush because you'll miss something important.

As for the Chandrakirti analogy, consequences are a useful way of realising emptiness but syllogisms are also important and play their part - don't be in a hurry to bin something that might be important. Even contemplating consequences is a gradual path.

For example, the trikāya chapter in the Suvarnaprabhāsa Sūtra states:

For example, lightening arises in an empty sky and light appears based upon lightening. Likewise, the sambhogakāya appears based on dharmakāya and the nirmanakāya appears based on the sambhogakāya.
The Mahāyāna-sūtrālaṃk̄ara states:
The divisions of the kāyas of the buddhas
are the svabhāvakāya and the sambhogakāya,
and the other one is the nirmanakāya.
The first two are supports.
And:
The svabhāvakāya is uniform,
subtle, connected with [the sambhogakāya],
exhibits the enjoyment of all joys,
and is asserted as the cause of the abundance of the sambhogakāya.
The svabhāva/dharmakāya is what one realizes for oneself. This realization spontaneously produces the other two kāyas. Therefore, it is sufficient to realize the dharmakāya alone.

The difference is that people of your inclination, gradualists, are algorithmic in their approach and understanding of practice and realization. People of our inclination, non-gradualists, are dialectical in our approach and understanding of practice and realization.

In fact, the whole Prasanga approach of Candrākirtī makes gradualism unnecessary. Just as one does not need to use syllogism (a form of algorithm) to demonstrate emptiness, and can demonstrate emptiness through consequences (a form of dialectics), likewise, one can realize dharmakāya dialectically, without the need to go step by step. Even in sūtrayāna, such persons are called thod rgal bas, people who skip stages.

tingdzin said:
IMO, "racism" is an imprecise and badly overworked word. In the present context, for example, are Tibetans really a "race"? What does the word mean, really? Certainly there are vast phenotypical (meaning visually apparent ) differences between Tibetans who come from the border areas of Amdo, for example, and those who come from areas near Ladakh. I suspect there is also considerable genotypical variation. Similarly, there are Thai people who look like Chinese, Burmans, Malays, Khmer, etc., but there is a concept of "Thainess" that has more to do with cultural assumptions than physical appearance or even political citizenship.

A more precise word might be "ethnocentric". Granted, it does not lend itself to name-calling as well as the word "racist", but it seems more accurate in a lot of cases where the term "racism" is bandied about.

How can there be nondual nature/dzogchen, while at the same time perceiving others with another nondual nature? Nondual = not one, not two, not many. Or no self-no other.
And still there is perception of other selves with a characteristic which is believing in a self-nondual by its doctrine?

Malcolm wrote:
The Great Perfection, like all other expressions of Buddhadharma, posits that individuals are unique and independent from one another. Everyone bears their own karma and results, everyone accumulates and purifies afflictions individually, everyone cycles through samsara on their own through the power of their own delusion.

The Buddha never rejected a conventional self, just as he never rejected the principle of the individual accumulation and ripening of karma.

The term "nondual" in Dzogchen texts, depending on context, either means freedom from the extremes of existence and nonexistence, or it means that we confuse our personal, individual experience of the world as a self and an other in absence of self and an other which can be established.

It does not mean that everything is one substance or one consciousness, etc. The latter proposition is a nonBuddhist point of view with no place in Buddhadharma at all.

The Great Perfection is completely different than Advaita in any form.

In the Great Perfection, vdyā/rigpa is understood to be particular and unique to each sentient being. There is no "unified field" of vidyā or field of consciousness which permeates all beings in the Great Perfection. Those who believe so have not understood a single word of Great Perfection teachings, much less a single word of the teachings of the Buddha.

Great Perfection Tantras explicitly reject the point of view you espouse above, going so far as to list Śankaracarya in the list of 60 teachers who teach wrong view.

The Buddha found the formless āyatana concentrations he was taught by Udraka Ramapūtra and Ārāla Kālāma useless in so far as they did not lead to liberation, but instead merely created traces for taking rebirth in the formless āyatanas. So, yes, he did state these were completely useless.

Most people do not realize that meditation is a kind of karma that creates results. When ordinary, common people meditate on the form realm dhyānas for the formless dhyānas they are creating seeds for rebirth in these realms. When Buddha meditated on these dhyānas he did so in order to observe that they were suffering, a cause for suffering, and that there was a cessation and a path from that suffering. When he had meditated and recognized the pernicious nature of all of these meditative "accomplishments," he entered the Vajropama-samadhi which destroyed every last trace of latent affliction which would cause rebirth in the three realms.

Definitely. For example, in Dzogchen teachings (of which this text is one), the all-basis( kun gzhi, ālaya ) is considered merely a repository of traces.

(2) Some non-Buddhists give it the name "the self."

Because if you can accept that Vimalamitra gave Chetsun Senghe Wangchuk complete transmission of the Vima Nyingtik then everything is possible. Just like ChNNR received so much teachings over the years in dreams from so many different masters of the past.

Hi Magnus:

The Great Image translated by Ani Jinpa is a very flawed book (though not because of her translation). If you look at the colophon, you will see that it was cobbled together and edited from various sources in the late 19th century by Dharma Senge because he thought the original terma version which was taken out by Jomo Menmo was too difficult for non-scholars to understand since it has many, many, interesting citations. Even though it is a terma, it is not a terma in the traditional sense in that it was composed by another Tibetan, Zhang Gnas gsar, who is 12th in line of the oral transmission from Vairocana. So it was not written down until a couple of centuries later.

The earliest recension of the accounts found in the 'Dra 'bag chen mo that are available to us is in the commentary on the Cuckoo of Vidya that I mentioned above which is found in the Bairo rgyud 'bum. The Bairo 'gyud 'bum text mentions the lineage you mention, but states that it happens within the span of 200 hundred years or eight human generations. So if we assume that Vairocana meets Śr̄ī Siṃha in the late eight century, this means that Garab Dorje's birth can be dated at the earliest around 600 CE.

In short, there is nothing wrong per se with the various conflicting lineage histories of Dzogchen. But when doing history we should not take them literally as facts, in the same way that we do not take Tonpa Shenrab's birth 18,000 years ago as a fact merely because the Bonpos claim it to be so. As I mention above, when it comes to history, it needs to correspond to ordinary human perception. This applies the Buddha, Jesus, Tonpa Shenrab, Garab Dorje, Muhammed, Shankaracarya, and any other founder or major figure of a religion about whom fantastic legends gradually develop. If we do take them as facts, we will wind up becoming fundamentalist ninnies.

Wth respect to visionary encounters, such as that between Vima and Chetsun, that is a whole different ball of wax. That cannot be subject to any kind of analysis. One either accepts it or not.

The real lineage of Dzogchen cannot be found in a book.

The only bka' ma traditions of Dzogchen are "sems sde" and the Vajra Bridge. Everything else, all of it, is terma.

For example, Dangma Lhungyal discovered the 17 tantras 30 years before he passed them onto Chetsun Senge Wangchuk, and Chetsun was only 15 when he received them. He received them, according to the only account we have, after the passing of Atisha. Atisha passed away in 1054. We do not know exactly how long after Chetsun met Dangma Lhungyal that Atisha passed. But, what we do know is that Zhangton received the 17 tantras from Chegom Ngapo in 1108. The only really firm fact we have in any of this is that Zhangton studied with Chegom for one year in 1108, according to Zhangton's son and revealed the Vima sNying thig in 1118. And of course, this presumes that the Nyinthig lineage account is the most definitive, which is questionable. But it is makes for very fun reading, with dragon-riding dākinīs and so on.

Malcolm wrote:
We can trace the historical part back to Śrī Siṃha. There is definitely an aural transmission. It is my point of view that the textual tradition developed out of this preexisting tradition. It seems that in India there were some short texts written, like the Great Space of Vajrasattva that were systematized into the Kun byed rgyal po, but there is zero chance, in my opinion, that the bulk of the Kun byed rgyal po is a translated text, unlike the four chapters which are incorporated into it based on the five early translations made by Vairocana [the fifth is the Cultivation of Bodhicitta by Mañjuśrīmitra, which I regard his actual composition]. We do not need to doubt the historicity of Garab Dorje, Mañjuśrīmitra, and Śri Siṃha, but it is unlikely, in my opinion, that Garab Dorje and Mañjuśrīmitra lived any earlier than the late seventh and early eighth centuries. Valby thinks the Mdo bcu was written by Vairocana, for example, but it is presented as an independent text in the sems sde section. As I have noted elsewhere, the whole division of Dzogchen into the three series is something which first appears in the Vima Snying thig in 1118. It is possible this idea was floating around in the very limited circles of those who were promulgating the 17 tantras prior to this time, but there is zero evidence for it.

florin said:
For example CNNr places Garab Dorje's existence as far back as 200 BCE maybe even earlier.

Malcolm wrote:
As far as dating Garab Dorje (Vajraprahelā) based on the Great Chronicle written by Zhangton — the Great Chronicle places the the birth of Garab Dorje 360 years after the parinirvana of the Buddha. It places the removal of the Vima Snying thig 1568 years after the parinirvana. Subtracting 360 from 1568 equals 1208, and subtracting 1208 from 1118 = -90, thus we arrive at a date of 90 BCE for the date of Garab Dorje's birth according to the Great Chronicle.


florin said:
What happens to the transmission of dzogchen between this date and early 8th or 9th century ?

Malcolm wrote:
The earliest sems sde history we have is from the Bairo rgyud 'bum. But is probably written in the 12th century and is contemporary with the Great Chronicle and the Vajra Bridge history. But it could not be more different in content and scope. In any case, there are two different versions of the birth of Garab Dorje, two of which agree on some details (klong sde and man ngag sde): he was born in Danakosha, a region or an island in Oddiyāna, he was born of a virgin birth, and his mother was the daughter of the king which suggest a common source. The names however of the king and the daughter differ completely. In the Vajra Bridge account there is no mention that the daughter is a nun. It is a major point in the Great Chronicle. The manner of conception differs as well — in the Vajra Bridge, Garab Dorje's birth is heralded by a turquoise cuckoo. No such mention is made in the Great Chronicle. The earliest "sems sde" account, the commentary on the Rig pa'i khu byug in the Bairo rgyud 'bum lacks any mention of these events.


florin said:
We have a gap of around 1000 years where we no nothing about dzogchen transmission .

Malcolm wrote:
It is only the Great Chronicle which gives positive dates for Garab Dorje, 90 BCE to 454 CE. According to it, Mañjuśrīmitra I rainbows in 740. Supposedly the second Mañjuśrīmitra II, his emanations comes in 1065, but of course this is much too late. In fact the chronology of events in the Great Chronicle does not stand up to scrutiny at all. So we cannot take it seriously with respect to dates of this or that person since it places the second Mañjuśrīmitra II not only after Śrī Siṃha, but also after Vimalamitra leaves for China.

Also the sems sde commentary mentioned above states there are 23 masters in the sems sde lineage spanning only 8 human generations. A generation is 25 years, thus the lineage is only 200 years old when it reaches Vairocana, if we accept the sems sde account in the Bairo rgyud 'bum. The Vajra Bridge lineage is short: Garab Dorje, Mañjuśrīmitra, Śrī Siṃha, and Vairocana.

mani said:
Thank you everybody for your answers. I still have some questions.

If is just a matter of dressing to blend with the sangha, why is that there are empowerments for each garment and earrings, and hair and else, is not just a vow to wear them but an empowerment right? why is the long hair considered the mandala of dakinis? I mean I think wearing all of these must have a profound meaning, is not just fashion.

Malcolm wrote:
Long hair is not considered a mandala of ḍakinīs, it has to be blessed that way. Otherwise long hair is just long hair.

In Indian Vajrayāna, each deity has it's own special commitments in terms of accouterments. For example, if you receive the Cakrasamvara empowerments, you were expected to have a set of six bone ornaments. In the beginning, when one's practice is at the level of weak heat on the path of application, one would be expected to wear these in private, and when one's practice becomes stronger, one would be expected to test one's resolve in practice by wearing them in increasingly public settings. For example, the reason why Padmasambhava holds a skullcup and a vajra is that is part of the commitments of having received the Śrī Heruka (Yang dag) empowerment, his main yidam.

Tibet is a different place than India and a different culture, so a different set of accouterments developed over the Indian layer. Slowly, over time, in a different culture, a new set of accouterments developed and became meaningful. Tibet is a country where it is difficult to run around half-naked like an Indian sadhu. In India, no mantrins wore a red and white shawl. If they were beginners, they just wore white like everyone else in public, and in private, they wore their requisite ornaments if they could afford them or carried a card painted with them. Tibet is a pretty cold place, so it is not practical for most people to run around without clothes.

Since we are in the Dzogchen forum, I will speak plainly. Dzogchen practitioners have no need of these kind of things. It has nothing to do with Dzogchen practice directly. The real point of the hair empowerment, as it relates to Dzogchen, is to have uncontrived hair, uncontrived clothes, and uncontrived dwellings, because the principle of Dzogchen is nonfabrication. To summarize, having an elegant Ngakpa kit defeats the whole meaning of uncontrived hair, cloths, etc.

When my guru Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje emerged from his first three year retreat in the early 1950's, he looked like a ragged bum. When he went to see Dudjom Rinpoche in Kongpo, he arrived where Dudjom Rinpoche was teaching, and sat in the back. But when Dudjom Rinpoche saw him there, he made fun of all the elegant Ngakpas sitting in the Gonpa for their carefully tended hair, ornaments, and robes, and asked Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje come and sit next to him, commenting that Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje was a real Ngakpa, unlike all the elegant so called Ngakpas sitting in the assembly. So if we want to be Ngakpas, it should be our intention to be real Ngakaps. Also, if we wish to kit up and run around in Ngakpa gear, it is probably better that we first develop some power of mantra. This does not happen overnight. For this reason, some teachers forbid their students to where Ngakpa gear until they have some juice in their practice.

Now, for someone who is following a Dzogchen path, Ngakpa ordinations can be aspirational. But it is not necessary for Dzogchen practitioners to receive these kinds of empowerments. If we do, it is probably a result of past karma, as Greg mentioned.

A Dzogchen practitioner has no need to become a monk, but there are many monks that practice Dzogchen. It is not necessary for a Dzogchen practitioner to become a ngakpa, but there are many ngakpas who also practice Dzogchen. In the primary empowerment texts of the Dzogchen tradition, you will never discover an empowerment which requires one to wear anything. It is not even necessary for a Dzogchen practitioner to become a lay person with all five vows. It is not even necessary for a Dzogchen practitioner to formally declare allegiance to this or that form of Buddhism, Tibetan or otherwise. Why? Because Dzogchen is the essence of Buddhadharma. Buddhism is fragmented into sects and traditions. Dzogchen is beyond sects and traditions. Buddhism is cultural. Dzogchen is beyond culture. Buddhism is a religion. Dzogchen is beyond religion.

I am not telling you this because I do not like the Ngakpa tradition. The Ngakpa tradition is just fine. But it really does not have anything to do with being a Dzogchen practitioner. When one is a Dzogchen practitioner, it is important to go to the core of the teachings and not be caught up in the rind.

In that case the entire conventional and traditional narrative of how dzogchen was transmitted and evolved on our planet is completely false.
Moreover, the existence of the first early masters is in doubt.

Malcolm wrote:
With respect to this, there is a mythical origin of Dzogchen teachings, legendary one, and a historical one.

The former involves all discussions of teachers in the distant past. The legendary one involves some accounts of the Buddha and Garab Dorje, etc. The historical one begins with persons that can be verified by more than one Indian source, in this case, the Buddha, Śrī Simha, and possibly Manjuśrīmitra and even Garab Dorje. The legendary and historical are intermixed until roughly the 12th century.

But if you approach these traditional accounts as historical facts, then I am sorry to disappoint you. From the ordinary human point of view, these things are not historically factual. We should just be grown up about it and derive our confidence in the teachings based on what they teach, not where they are  supposed to come from.

Thing is though that our present karma can address the current situation in order to mitigate the problem, to an extent.  While I may be born with a larger share of power and wealth due to my generosity in the past, the only thing that is stopping me from sharing my current power and wealth with this in a less fortunate state, is my actions right now.  Buddhism addresses this issue through the application of the Paramita, these would not be espoused if they were not actually effective.  Okay, ultimately the Paramita are practiced for reasons of Buddhahood and not for political utopian projects, but I don't think they are mutually exclusive.

Malcolm wrote:
It means if you really want to understand the Kun byed rgyal po, a composite text which cannot date earlier than the 10th century, one should examine the commentaries on the Guhyagarbha, especially Longchenpa's Dispelling Darkness in the Ten Directions and Rongzom's Jewel Commentary. Why? Because the exegetical precedents we find in the Guhyagarbha influence all later Great Perfection exegetical traditions. For example, the idea that Samantabhadra is a byed pa po, a creator, is more clearly explained in these commentaries than it is in Zhenphan Ozer's commentary on the Kun byed rgyal po itself, the latter dependingly heavily on the former. In other words, the Guhyagarbha gives us the general model, based on which Dzogchen tantras were composed. It is a literary issue, not a criticism of the contents of the Kun byed rgyal po per se.

Apart from the markedly tantric context of Great Perfection texts, they really are just a continuation of the Yogacara synthesis that begins with Maitreyanatha in the 4th century. Why do I say this? Because ideas like Akaniṣṭha and the three kāyas do not appear before this time. Indeed, there are only two sūtras in bka' 'gyur that actually mention all three kāyas by name — the Suvarnaprabhāsottama Sūtra and the Trikāya Sūtra. This is truly amazing when you consider a) the sūtra division of the Bka' 'gyur is 78 volumes of texts and b) the three kāyas are the principle explanatory scheme around which all Tibetan Buddhist schools revolve and the result they all intend to gain. There is a distinct  possibility in fact that the Trikāya chapter in the Suvarnaprabhāsottama Sūtra is based on the Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkāra rather than the other way around. It is certain the Trikāya Sūtra is a condensation of the Trikāya chapter in the Suvarnaprabhāsottama Sūtra.

Norbu Rinpoche, when considering the question of the date of Tonpa Shenrab states, "[S]ince history must be studied in congruence with ordinary human perception, I prefer not to base myself on these traditions." In the same way, when considering the origin of Great Perfection teachings, I have to say that traditions around their dissemination are contradictory in the first place, and in the second, do not stand up to historical research.

Malcolm

First of all thank you for giving me a clear answer and not giving a moral sermon like others.
In general, you don't need robes to a Dharma practitioner.
So, you don't wear robes but you don't cut your hair, why is this vow more important than the robes or the earings?

Malcolm wrote:
No, I generally never wear robes. I have them, but I don't wear them. In my tradition, [Kunzang Dechen Lingpa] one's hair is blessed as mandala of ḍākinīs. Whether one wears ngakpa gear or not, one cannot cut one's hair at all. In the Dudjom tradition, there is more flexibility. Many of the Dudjom Ngakpas I know trim their hair from time to time. This kind of defeats the purpose of the Dudjom hair wang, but that is their business and not mine. They do a little confession.

mani said:
As far as Ngakpa vows go, if you gave taken any major empowerment, you already have them.
I have received major empowerments, I didn't know I had them though but I will study them and try to keep them. Does this mean I can dress as a nagkpa now because I already have the vows? Does this mean I took the vow of not cutting my hair?

Malcolm wrote:
Unless you received a hair empowerment specifically, you have no obligation to keep your hair long. As far as the other vows go, anyone who has received a major empowerment in any tradition needs to maintain and respect the fourteen root downfalls and the eight branch downfalls. Then there are the 27 samayas of body, voice, and mind which are the main set of samayas to follow with Nyingma. You can read all of these things in Buddhist Ethics by Kongtrul.

Whether or not you can wear ngakpa gear depends on your guru.

mani said:
In terms of wearing a stripped shawl, as you have already discovered, the criteria for wearing these shawls shifts from Sangha to Sangha. What you can ascertain from this is that there is no canonical rule. The use of the striped shawl is a Tibetan innovation that evolved gradually over time. Lay mantra practitioners in India wore white, like other lay people.
What is the meaning of this shawl? What was the purpose for dressing like this in old Tibet?

Malcolm wrote:
It means different things in different lineages, and that meaning depends on how it is explained during the empowerments. Of course, empowerments with a red and white shawl are strictly a Nyingma thing. There is also no set costume for Ngakpas. Ngakaps in different places wore different things. The present Ngakpa outfit that we commonly see in the West is largely a result of Dudjom Rinpoche's influence. Repkong Ngakpas look completely different.

mani said:
Therefore, you should do as your primary teacher suggests, and not worry about what other people do.
My primary teacher is Padmasambhava, all my Nyingma lamas are his manifestations and they tell me different things about this. What does Padmasambhava says? Can anyone quote him?

Malcolm wrote:
The stripped shawl evolved long after Padmasambhava left Tibet, so I think he has very little to say on the subject. There is one spurious tantra floating around on the internet that makes some claims, but it's source is highly questionable. No Tibetan original seems to exist for this text.

Ngakpas like the Sakya family commonly wear a white lower robe and an upper red shawl. My personal opinion is that the stripped shawl evolved out of this custom. When we see depictions of ancient Ngakpas like the 25 disciples, they are never depicted with the striped shawl. We can understand from this that it is a relatively modern custom that originated in Eastern Tibet within the last 400 hundred years.

Vibhuticandra says much the same thing in his commentary on the Bodhicaryāvatāra:
With respect to the traces of emptiness, since ṡrāvakas and so on cannot bear the fact that all phenomena are empty, it is said they are liberated solely through seeing four truths of nobles. Since they obtain freedom only through the direct perception of the "truths" — suffering, the origin, the cessation, and the path— of what use to them is seeing emptiness?

sherabpa said:
This is a mistranslation. Here Vibhuti he is simply restating the shravakas objection to the Mahayana emptiness, which is 9.40ab of the Charyavatara, i.e. that emptiness is pointless because they meditate on the Four Truths instead.  Vibhuti then gives the response (9.40cd), which as usual is to quote Mahayana sutras for the need to meditate on emptiness, and hence there follows a dispute about why the shravakas should accept the Mahayana sutras.

Malcolm wrote:
Which means that Śantideva is portraying śrāvakas as not meditating on emptiness directly.
It is also somewhat foolish to assert that arhats realize the selflessness of phenomena when it has nothing at all to do with how they achieve their realization since they never even meditate the view of the emptiness of the person let alone emptiness in general.

sherabpa said:
This is contradicted by many masters, e.g. Mipham says in Beacon of Certainty, 'Our own position in that whatever types of shravakas and pratyekabuddhas appeared of yore and reached arhatship did not become liberated without realizing the emptiness of the self that is the apprehension of the aggregates; but just having that realization does not mean that they realized selflessness entirely.'

Malcolm wrote:
But they do not meditate the emptiness of the person directly. They meditate on impermanence and so on. Emptiness of the person is the result they realize, it is not the view they meditate. Your Mipham quote agrees: "...did not become liberated without realizing the emptiness of the self that is the apprehension of the aggregates."

Those elements have simply come together to form a lump in which the citta then takes up residence...The citta itself is the real culprit, not the lump of physical elements. The body is not some hostile entity whose constant fluctuations threaten our well-being. It is a separate reality that changes naturally according to its own inherent conditions.

The four noble truths are what is taught to be the definitive insight one needs to gain on the shravaka path. And there what one needs to recognise is how there is suffering, how suffering arises, how it ceases, and how one can bring it to cessation. In short, the goal is not to have or maintain any ideas of what characterises phenomena, but to let go of them, to end one's clinging. So, what I don't see the evidence of is how there can remain anything one keeps being hooked on anything.

Malcolm wrote:
The point is that arhats suffer from obscurations, and that their wisdom is insufficient to perceive the real nature of phenomena, even though they have a partial realization through which they can claim to be liberated (and liberation in Buddhadharma simply means being free of the afflictions that cause rebirth in samsara).

An this is something I have difficulty to take literally on a practical level. Sure, most of the usual criticisms of arhats look valid for people obsessed with total cessation and/or systems and lists of dharmas. But I fail to see them as anything but common warnings one can find in all sorts of teachings, and that is likely the reason why Mahayana traditions kept this view of the arhat alive (at the same time, arhats in East Asia are also popular spirit/deity/bodhisattva-like beings).

I understand. The historical narrative of the arrival of Dzogchen teaching in Tibet was radically altered by the revelation of the Vima Nyinthig in 1118, so much so that it literally eclipsed earlier narratives. There are no traditional Tibetan teachers that question this narrative, even though it definitely is the case that prior to the VN, the lingo of the three series was never used by anyone. For example, the earliest comprehensive history of Dharma composed by Nyangral in the late 12th does not mention these terms at all.

He refers to five main systems of Dzogchen. The first one is the the one we understand as klong sde, which he simply summarizes as the lineage given to Yudra Nyingpo connected with the five tantras typically now associated with klong sde. But he does not mention Mipham Gonpo, nor 'Dzeng. It appears that he does not know about the Vajra Bridge at all.

He mentions the lineage of Aro Yeshe Jungney. He mentions the cycle of the Kun byed rgyal po. He mentions the Brahmin cyle. He also mentions the unsurpassed Dzogchen cycle of the 17 tantras. He never mentions anything about the three series anywhere. He was a generation younger than Zhangton Tashi Dorje, the  terton of the VN, so this definitely shows that in the late twelfth century, the idea of the three series was restricted to the circle around Zhangton. Thus, it is really only in post- 12th century texts outside of the VN where we begin to see the systemization of the three series applied to Dzogchen teachings.

What we can see from the above is that the main sūtra that deals with this issue is the Lanka, the main polemical sūtra in this respect.

In general, what is discussed in the Perfection of Wisdom sūtras is the limitations upon the omniscience of arhats and pratyekabuddhas, and this is why in that body of sūtras there is an extensive discussion of how emptiness is understood with respect to arhats and pratyekabuddhas where it is primarily stated that one should avoid their result because śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have trained in characteristics of the aggregate, etc., that lack a self because of being impermanent and so on, rather than in emptiness.

For example, the Lanka responds to your question, "to what do arhats grasp?"
Further, if it is asked what is the śravakas to the nature of conceiving entities, it is like this, having perceived...the elements that arise without a creator, intrinsic and general characteristics, reasongings, scripture, and authority, they cling to the nature of those.
Note, I am not addressing the issue of how Mahāyāna commentators deal with the absence of the two selves. That is a whole different question.


Astus said:
The issue is whether they are attached to the aggregates or not. In order to keep any form of traces, obscurations, or defilements for arhats, they necessarily have to still cling to the aggregates and the areas,

Malcolm wrote:
The location of traces is in the mind stream of course. Daṃṣṭrasenam, in his commentary on the 100,000 lines Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra, notes that the result of possessing those traces mentions specifically that arhats can err, gossip, can be unattractive, are forgetful, and so on.

But the above only refers to past traces, the absence of which is how the eighteen unshared qualities of a buddha are defined. But that is not really the most important point. Below we will see too that it is claimed that arhats also do not abandon the traces of conceptuality.

The most important point is that śrāvakayanists in general do not meditate on the view of emptiness. As we will see below, they meditate in the four truths and this is how they attain their awakening. They realize the person as a momentary formation and this is what it means to say that an arhat realizes "the selflessness of persons." But they do not meditate directly on the view of emptiness in anyway. The  Goenka Vipassana school is an excellent example of this principle.

Bhavaviveka II mentions in the Tarkajvala that the difference between nirvana of a buddha and an arhat is the the latter's nirvana is result of totally abandoning the two obscurations, while the latter's nirvana is merely severing the continuum of their physical body in samsara. He remarks too that the traces of affliction from cultivating afflictions from beginningless time exist within arhats. He distinguishes buddhas by pointing out that they totally eliminate all afflictions along with their traces by cultivating the view of emptiness for a long while, and they eliminate the knowledge obscuration the same way. This is not how arhats attain their realization since their realization is attained not by meditating on emptiness, but rather by meditating the four noble truths in sixteen moments on the path of seeing.

Vibhuticandra says much the same thing in his commentary on the Bodhicaryāvatāra:
With respect to the traces of emptiness, since ṡrāvakas and so on cannot bear the fact that all phenomena are empty, it is said they are liberated solely through seeing four truths of nobles. Since they obtain freedom only through the direct perception of the "truths" — suffering, the origin, the cessation, and the path— of what use to them is seeing emptiness?
Jayananda's commentary on the Madhyamakāvatāra states:
Therefore, śrāvakas and pratyekabuddha do not abandon the affliction of the traces of conceptuality, but because bodhisattvas, beginning on the eighth bhumi, are able to exhaust the affliction of the traces of of conceptuality through the power of the path of effortlessness and characteristiclessness, they are able to attain buddhahood.
Thus, it is somewhat inane to speculate about where traces reside in an arhat. It is also somewhat foolish to assert that arhats realize the selflessness of phenomena when it has nothing at all to do with how they achieve their realization since they never even meditate the view of the emptiness of the person let alone emptiness in general.

Finally, concerning the Lanka and its samadhi-intoxicated arhats, Jñānavajra states:
With respect to that, the three liberations are the three awakenings which are equivalent in abandoning afflictions. 

"The absence of self in phenomena," and so on means that the ultimate suchness and the pristine consciousness which realizes that is liberated from afflictions and abandons the obscuration of knowledge — this is Mahāyāna of the result. 

It is taught that śrāvakas cannot realize that. "Just as..." and "They are distracted by characteristics" means they are distracted because they conceptualize particular and universal characterisics of the aggregates and so on, and thus cannot abandon the knowledge obscuration. In the same way, though they indeed abandon the active causes of the afflictive obscuration, they cannot abandon the latent ones. Through perceiving sensation and perception as flaws, they solely rely on the method of pacifying them and are intoxicated with an intoxicating samadhi that lacks the wisdom that realizes the truth. Since they abandon the manifest causes of affliction, they reside in the uncontaminated dhātu. If is asked whether that is their ultimate result, they do no reach an ultimate result apart from that. That being the case, if it is wondered whether or not they are outside of and turned away from samsara, through realizing the emptiness of the person as being a momentary formation and understanding a self is an agent of action, there is no further accumulated karma for birth in samsara and the causal condition for the active cause of craving and addiction are absent, just as a log floating on the ocean does sink to the bottom, there is no certainty of their remaining in one place. If it is wondered how long they remain in the the uncontaminated dhātu, it is said "Samadhi, etc..." 

"Then I will cause them to obtain the dharmakāya..." means that as explained already, when through their own roots of virtue and the blessings of the tathāgata they awaken from uncontaminated dhātu and generate the mind for supreme awakening. Having filled their compliment of the two accumulations, they will obtain the dharmakāya."
Thus we can also see there is no place where such arhats "reside" after death, no Hinayāna pure land. After their nirvana, arhats have no location per se, being like "logs floating on the ocean, moved by the waves."

I have a few questions after reading Guruyoga in preparation for today's webcast. (Realized I should have done this sooner so I could spend some more time memorizing the recitations and could have caught the explanatory conference call, but oh well...)

What is a "Tun"? We're apparently supposed to know how to do them. It seems like the "Tun Book" contains a decent amount of material used in the transmission. Is it something one should buy for that sake?

Malcolm wrote:
Thun means "session" or period of time.

How exactly should we visualize the thigle and white A? Like we're looking at our bodies externally and the thigle is just kind of projected on us? And eyes open or closed?

The A is visualized facing outward.

The visualizations in general have a lot going on. Is there a precise way we're technically supposed to do them, or is it fine to just kind of try your best to do what seems right?


Malcolm wrote:
You just think about it briefly and then let it go.



Temicco said:
The introduction and p.37/38 present guruyoga ultimately as being in the state of rigpa as reflected in the teacher, but then on page 32, 36, and 44 guruyoga is presented as the key for discovering our real nature, and consisting of thigle visualization during transmission. Page 43 seemingly discusses it in both ways at once. So are there 2 main guruyogas in dzogchen, the one of being in rigpa and the one done during transmission or at other times in order to unlock rigpa?


Malcolm wrote:
Ati Guru Yoga is both a method of introduction and a means for discovering what was introduced if you did not succeed.

Temicco said:
The introduction makes it sound like the fourth chapter is about conduct and integrating guruyoga, so does that mean that all of the instructions contained therein are only for people who have had an experience of rigpa already? (I don't understand what "integration" could be being talked about otherwise, nor how one could know how to be in instant presence otherwise.)

Malcolm wrote:
No, it is for anyone who is interested to know what conduct is from a Dzogchen perspective, so one can gradually integrate it into one's life.


Temicco said:
The worldwide transmission just consists of ChNN giving oral, symbolic, and then direct transmission, right?


Malcolm wrote:
It is an Anuyoga practice which involves direct introduction.



Temicco said:
Does the melody and so on matter? I only have the Guruyoga book and it is too late this time to catch the explanatory conference call for the other details. Lacking them, I can still pay attention and do the visualizations and so on, but will transmission still occur if I'm not well prepared for the singing and recitations? (Also, I assume the visualizations and mental stuff going on at each recitation are the most important thing, so is it better not to recite if it would be distracting?)


Malcolm wrote:
Just follow along with ChNN. (I wish I had a bouncing ball gif).

After being present for the transmission, what next? I'm very confused about empowerments and so on and what I am allowed to / should practise at each step (particularly given that I would practice alone, seemingly).

However, the traces of those are not harmful in the same way they are for common immature people.
Or་ the Ārya-bodhisattva-piṭaka-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
The uncontaminated pristine consciousness (jñāna) of the śrāvakas 
has not completely destroyed traces.
The Ārya-laṅkāvatāra-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
Just as a log floating on the ocean

It is begging the question to use the example of emptiness because that's the very thing under dispute. That would constitute circular reasoning.

And I don't think actual unproduced space is apprehended either. If I were to look off into empty space I wouldn't see space, I would see blackness, and unproduced space doesn't have color of any kind. If it did have a color then everything would be obscured by that color because everywhere is pervaded by unproduced space.

My apologies, post forthcoming. Malcolm is (quite obviously) more qualified than I to speak of something as "tantric" or not tantric, so if he says tantra was not practiced at a certain time, that should probably be believed even if it appears to contradict some archaeological findings, given the esoteric nature of tantric discourse, and, I assume, the commentarial tradition of addressing the tantric tradition itself that is no doubt present within that tradition. The archaeological findings I was referring to (and am slowly working on making that post on) are some seemingly Vajrayana-influenced or at least Mahayana statuary, art, and artefacts that date from after the destruction of the Abhayagirivihāra occasionally appearing in the material records of history. Indicating, to me, that there was at least some divergent "non-Theravāda" being practiced by a minority, that at the very least appropriated Mahāyāna iconography and visual language to suit its ends. But artefacts does not necessarily a living historical tradition make I will certainly admit.

Of course emptiness isn't apprehendable. If it were, then it wouldn't be a nonimplicitive negation because you'd be replacing one thing with another. Do you think that on the path of seeing one perceives some sort of object called emptiness? It is abundantly clear from a cursory reading of the Prajnaparamita Sutras that this is not the case. Rather than apprehending an object called emptiness, one doesn't apprehend anything at all, and this very non-apprehension is itself what is called realizing emptiness.

To turn emptiness into an object like this is in fact the exact error of Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen, the great Jonangpa teacher.

1. I wanted to move to Arizona, potentially.  If I participated in the Drikung Kagyu lineage there, Would the resident lama be my root lama?

2. What constitutes the actual "root lama?"

Please help me clarify because I'm coming from a Dzogchen perspective

Thank you,
Stefos

These are not the 'decisive experience' that Longchenpa writes of. When I said acausal, I was referring specifically to the decisive experience he mentions. This is not the same thing as insight or any meditative result of absorption. He specifically mentions all meditation falls short in this respect. There is no concentration or effort that can cause this. The Christians would call this grace. Can you understand what I'm talking about?

Malcolm wrote:
Longchenpa, in this case, is writing about the second word of Garab Dorje, "Decide one thing." ChNN parses this as "remain without doubt." How do we remain without doubt or decide on one thing? By using different kinds of experience to discover knowledge of the our state, aka the basis.

Also, it states in chapter 5 of Realms and Transformations of Sound Tantra ( sgra thal gyur ) very clearly:
"The fault of not meditating
is the visible appearance of samsara.
The recognition of the basis is nothing at all like grace. Dzogchen teachings require a great deal of effort until you actually do decide on on thing — then you can continue in the confidence of liberation, or as ChNN puts, "continue in that state."

However, just so we can be absolutely clear the context from which you are speaking, precisely which of Longchenpa's statements are you referring to? Which book? Which translation? Which chapter? Which page?

There is no grace in Dzogchen teachings at all. For example, when we talk of "the teaching through blessings" or the lineage of the transcendent state of the victors, what is actually meant is that the Sambhogakāya communicates the teachings through light to the buddhas of the five families and so on. But there is no concept in Dzogchen which resembles the concept of Christian grace at all, i.e., "the free and unmerited favor of God, as manifested in the salvation of sinners and the bestowal of blessings."

I was under the impression that what you mentioned are not really Dzogchen practices, per se, but come under the general Vajrayana banner and preliminary teachings involving mind training and other preparatory work. I don't see Dzogchen being a 'how to' teaching and Longchenpa makes it clear there is no meditation involved in realizing anything. It seems it is an inspired exposition of the nature of awakened mind and its metaphorical qualities such as emptiness, openness, unity, etc., which attempt to 'liken' it to experiences that the ordinary mind can somewhat conceptualize, but never really grasp. He talks about effortless being and a 'decisive experience' that instantaneously awakens mind to this all. Time and effort are not involved in this. Am I taking this too literally?

I've read and been exposed to quite a bit of his work. I understand there is a process of mind training, up to a certain point. But, I don't see this training as a springboard to this 'decisive experience' that Longchenpa mentions in his writings. For me, the training is about cultivating a life that is not neurotic and harmful. It is a kind of psychology. What Longchenpa writes about awakened mind is not the same thing as an intellectual understanding of his writings where a model is built in the mind and repeated again and again. It seems to me that what he talks about is an organic change in the whole being that is far beyond an exercise, a lack of doubt, or a gaining of confidence. This decisive experience is acausal and does not happen because of.........


Malcolm wrote:
For example, the seventh mind training is involved with gaining experience in bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality so that one does not mistake them for one's vidyā (rig pa).

The idea that discovering knowledge (rig pa) of ones state (byang chub sems) is acausal is ludicrous since the consequence of such a statement is that no one needs direct introduction at any time ever and that discovering knowledge (rig pa) of ones state (byang chub sems) can happen at any time to anyone including animals, hell beings and pretas. In fact the point is made over and over again that the cause for discovering knowledge (rig pa) of ones state (byang chub sems) is the intimate instructions of one's guru.

In fact oral teaching from my Sakya teacher partially supports TKF's assertion although  I would not have put it as he did ("Hinayana Pure Lands").  The standard Sakya view is that Arhats are indeed reborn in some kind of Pure Realm where they are intoxicated by samadhi.

“Bhagavan, how should a bodhisattva view the mind at the time of death?”

Then the Bhagavan replied:

“Akashagarbha, at the time a bodhisattva dies, he or she should meditate on the pristine consciousness at the time of death. That pristine consciousness is: since all phenomena are pure by nature, the thought of the non-existence of things is the best meditation. Since all phenomena are included in bodhicitta, the thought of great compassion is the best meditation. Since all phenomena are imperceptible and luminous, the thought which has no attachment to things at all is the best meditation. Because the mind is realized to be pristine consciousness, the thought that does not seek buddhahood elsewhere is the best meditation.”

The Bhagavan spoke these verses:

Since all phenomena are pure by nature, 
meditate the thought of the non-existence of things. 
With bodhicitta,
meditate the thought of great compassion.
Imperceptible by nature, luminous, 
meditate without any attachment to things at all.
Mind is the cause of the arising of pristine consciousness,

Thus the Bhagavan spoke, and and retinue, the bodhisattva Akashagarbha, etc., was very pleased. and praised the Bhagavan’s words. 

The Pristine Consciousness at Time of Death Mahāyāna Sūtra is complete.

do not seek buddhahood elsewhere. 

Thus the Bhagavan spoke, and and retinue, the bodhisattva Akashagarbha, etc., was very pleased. and praised the Bhagavan’s words. 

The Pristine Consciousness at Time of Death Mahāyāna Sūtra is complete.

The Abhayagiri tradition was destroyed completely in the 12th century, at least one of its monks came to study in Sakya, Tibet. It has no influence on S.E. Asia after this date. It is anachronistic to term them Theravadins as well.

With respect to the kind of Buddhism present in SE  before the Theravada hegemony:

Coëmgenu said:
A similar situation must have obtained throughout south-east Asian Buddhism, for we know that the areas of Thailand, Burma, and Cambodia where Theravāda now flourishes were formerly dominated by Mahāyāna, or Sanskritic Śrāvakayāna Buddhism. We note the widespread occurrence of the cult of Upagupta throughout this region, which is totally absent from Sri Lanka, and wonder whether this gives a hint as to the kind of Buddhism prevalent before the Theravāda orthodoxy. According to I-Tsing, in the lands on the eastern boundaries of India all four major schools flourished, while in the island regions the Mūlasarvāstivāda predominated.

When these areas ‘converted’ to Theravāda (which mainly occurred around the 11th-12th Centuries), it is impossible that all the monks took new ordinations. Of course, the official histories will assert that when the religion was reformed that all the monks conformed to the new system.But the practicalities of this are absurd: sending city administration monks wandering through 1000s of miles of tiger-stalked, bandit-infested, ghost-haunted jungle tracks seeking out countless little villages, trying to persuade senior monks that their ordination is invalid or improper and must be done again, all on the basis of some political compromise in a far-distant capital, in a region of ever-shifting borders and allegiances. As history this is sheer fantasy, and the reality must have been that the reforms would directly affect only certain central m onasteries.



Malcolm wrote:
The Yogāvacara tradition is a syncretic tradition with no Indian antecedents or relationship with Vajrayāna at all of the kind we find in Tibet and Japan. We might indeed call it a indigenous tradition, but to call it "Tantric" results from a misunderstanding of what Buddhist tantra is and what tantras are.

Well, regardless of what we call it, in Thailand and Sri Lanka in particular, what we now call "Theravada" used to be highly syncretic with Vajrayana Buddhism, to the point where when tantric practices faced persecution, it amounted to a "reinvention" of Buddhism in the area, which was the birth of Theravada Buddhism in its modern day form. Is that fair?

Malcolm wrote:
No, since Vajrayāna belongs to Mahāyāna, and Mahāyan̄a in general does not belong to any of the so-called 18 schools, though it is heavily dependent on the Abhidharma perspective offered by the Sarvāstivādins.

Mahāyāna Buddhism in general was the main form of Buddhism practiced in Southeast Asia from 5th to the 13th century. Theravada was revived during the Pagan empire in the 11th century, and with the collapse of the Khmer empire in the 13th century, Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna went into decline in that region.


Coëmgenu said:
The argument being that what is now considered mainstream Theravada Buddhism is actually a product of the 1800s during Rama IV's suppression of tantric practices in Thailand. What was practiced before was a free interchange and inter-mixing of Tantrism and some proto-Theravada elements with Tantrism by-far dominating.

Do you disagree?

Malcolm wrote:
I absolutely disagree. There can be no Vajrayāna without well established Mahāyāna traditions. Calling folk magic practices "tantric" practices is just a way of discrediting Vajrayāna by associating it with popular magical practices found in Thailand etc.

In fact oral teaching from my Sakya teacher partially supports TKF's assertion although  I would not have put it as he did ("Hinayana Pure Lands").  The standard Sakya view is that Arhats are indeed reborn in some kind of Pure Realm where they are intoxicated by samadhi.

The standard Sakya view is that arhats are not reborn anywhere. They remain in a samadhi of cessation (the samadhi body), similar to formless realm beings. They are indeed revived from this samadhi of cessation to continue on the bodhisattva path, starting from the beginning on the path of accumulation.

During an ayahuasca ceremony years ago, I had a vision that was full of the brightest solid rainbow colors. Upon this colored background appeared some text in (gold?) letters that looked like Tibetan script (it was a very angular Brahmic-looking script). Surrounding this text was an ideal golden rectangle (its sides had no thickness), which may have zoomed into and out of the text. There were also several golden arrows outside it, on its sides, that were intently pointing at the boxed text, as if earnestly and urgently telling me to read it. I looked at it and tried, but was not able to decipher it, not being familiar with the language, and also being somewhat overwhelmed by the experience. It felt like a "place" that was exceedingly pure (in a way that felt "too" transcendental) and entirely made of mind.
This happened before I became interested in Buddhism, and although the experience doesn't necessarily seem to be related to Buddhadharma, my mind connected the experience to it, and imagined it might have been some Vajrayana teaching I was clueless to.

I'm not familiar with what kind of visions people might have in Vajrayana practice, if any (I currently practice in the Theravada tradition), so was wondering if such things can occur, if any meaning is to be extracted from this experience, or if it's just a substance-induced delusion.

The Forest Tradition in Thailand dates from 1900, founded by Ajaan Mun and Ajaan Sao Kanatasilo.

as per the will ...go back and read the context in which i first used it...it's not about a discussion of will or the term i made up on the fly...

"The state" is talked about also in the Lotus Sūtra, just not extensively:

Tathāgata is suchness [tathāta]. Suchness is the limit of reality. The limit of reality is the dharmadhātu. Suchness, the limit of reality, and the dharmadhātu are names for Dharma of the Saddharmapuṇḍarika.
FYI, there is no creationism in Dzogchen.

Since all paths in Buddhism lead to lead to enlightenment, it's a useless activity to label a path higher or lower. It benefits nobody and causes unnecessary division.

Some paths are more rapid than others. Some paths do not lead all the way to complete buddhahood.


Rakz said:
All Buddhist paths lead to some realization, but those realizations are surpassable until one reaches the apex of yānas.

Malcolm wrote:
There's no such thing as the "apex of yanas". This line of thinking does nothing but boost the ego which is why we often see Vajrayanists(not all) belittle other practices and think it is perfectly fine when they are just creating more bad karma for themselves.[/quote]

Of course there is an apex of yānas. For example, Śantideve points out that the ultimate of the lower is the relative of the higher in reference to tenet systems. Thus the view of Vaibhāṣika is lower than that of Sautrantika; the view of Sautrantika is lower than that of Yogacara, the view of Yogacara is lower than that of Madhyamaka and so on.

While indeed it is incorrect to needlessly belittle anyone's path, whether Buddhist or nonBuddhist, it is much worse karma to abandon a higher path for a lower path.

By your reasoning, it is also incorrect to state that nonBuddhist paths do not lead to any realization at all.

All Buddhist paths lead to some realization, but those realizations are surpassable until one reaches the apex of yānas.

What is the short explanation on the difference between mundane and transcendent accumulations?

Grigoris said:
First thing that popped into my head too. I've never heard of merit being categorised in this manner.

Malcolm wrote:
Mundane merit is exhaustible. For example, this eon begins with a compliment of natural merit; but as latent afflictions become more and more prevalent in the sentient beings who inhabit it, that merit declines resulting the destruction of the billion world system aka the universe.

Transcendent merit is merit dedicated keeping in mind the three wheels of the emptiness of someone dedicating merit, someone to receive it, and the act of dedication. This merit is indestructible and ripens as the major and minor marks, etc.

Must have some pretty decent accumulations to have been born as a human with all the qualities, characteristics and endowments necessary for enlightenment.

Anyway, right now you are asking us to buy that there are beings that, during their infinite round of rebirths in samsara, have acquired no accumulations at all???

There are two kinds of accumulation of merit: mundane and transcendent — the accumulations I was referring to were the latter.

I believe that only the vajrayana offers the posibility of Buddhahood within one lifetime.
So do I.

But then I've also been taught that since i can't see karma I can't tell how many lifetimes a person has already been practicing. So maybe somebody has been at it for a long time already and is ripe to the point where any little thing might tip be what it takes for them to become enlightened. Individual karma trumps general principle.

That is a nuance worth mentioning. I don't think it changes anything I've said regarding the relevance of inclusion of the Pure Land approach in general though. Did you read Tashi Nyima’s article, and if yes, what did you think?

Tārāmitra said:
As for the debate concerning the relevance of various Dharmic paths under these conditions, my own take on the matter is thus: accelerated paths like the Vajrayāna are complex and extremely elaborate and the strictly Tantric dimension is not the one suited to the largest number of people as far as the ultimate result is concerned.

Malcolm wrote:
This is not the perspective of the tantras themselves. Their perspective is quite the opposite.

Tārāmitra said:
Vajrayāna CAN lead to enlightenment in one lifetime for SOME people, and in these cases, concerning individuals of a highly yogic predisposition, Vajrayāna is certainly a more effective way.

Malcolm wrote:
Someone who received abhisheka and maintains their basic samaya, will, without any practice in this lifetime at all achieve buddhahood within at most 16 lifetimes, or so the tantras promise us.

Tārāmitra said:
But when it comes to MOST western seekers today, a more simple path like Pure Land can be just as beneficial, as in these cases rebirth in a Pure Land is present as the most realistic potential for immediate result of practice in one life.

Malcolm wrote:
It is nevertheless a slow path.

Tārāmitra said:
The vastness of Vajrayāna may simply seem overwhelming for many people and more intricate than it has to be in order to secure the best result most people can really expect in these degenerate times.

The essence of Vajrayāna practice is guru yoga, not practicing the Kalacakra or [insert yidam here] creation and completion stages.

I guess we are defining tension differently then.  Tension, as a psychological term (associated with the fight or flight reaction), is also linked to alertness and vigilance.  Which are also positive mental functions.

I'm defining it froma quasi behavioural science pseudo Abhidharmic position.

The fact of the matter is that saying that tension--->distraction is like saying relaxation--->dullness.  It is not 100% valid.  Excessive tension can lead to distraction and excessive relaxation can lead to dullness.    But realistically, both are necessary (or unnecessary) to a degree.

About that "soup" would it be advisable to have two separate practices then?
