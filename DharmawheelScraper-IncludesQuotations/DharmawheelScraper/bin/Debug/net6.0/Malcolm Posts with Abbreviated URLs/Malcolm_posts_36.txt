Do you go the fundamentalist route and insist, while flying around the globe, that there is a huge Mt. Meru in the middle of it and the world is actually flat, surrounded by a massive ocean bordered by iron mountains high enough to keep the fatal stench of the intermediate hells away, or not?

What he said about Tibetans is that they need to be more so. If we are less so than Tibetans, we need to double our efforts to become devotional compared to a Tibetan.

Malcolm wrote:
Actually, his critique of Tibetans is mainly rooted in Tibetans mistaking their cultural traditions for the Dharma, just as you mistake Tibetan cultural traditions for the Dharma.

It is not that Tibetan cultural traditions are not intrinsically valuable for Tibetans, but that Tibetan culture is not American or European culture.

The Dharma is relevant irrespective of culture, but aping Tibetans is not going to bring us closer to Dharma.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, first of all, I don't think there are any awakened Advaitans, or Taoists, or Christians, or Muslims, or shamans, etc.

With respect to Zen, of course there are awakened Zen masters. But since Zen and sūtra in general lack the teachings on lhundrup, they cannot not account for how delusion begins nor do they have the framework for attaining the body of light, etc. One might say they have partial rigpa, since they realize the emptiness side of phenomena, but not the apparent side of phenomena.

Those teachings do not exist anywhere else. Using the term rigpa with reference to Advaita or Zen is so out of context as to be meaningless. Advaitans, Zen folks, Vipassanistas don't practice Atiyoga, and do not even have any of the conceptual framework that defines rigpa as rigpa.

However, a lot of Marx's analysis of capitalism, both in Das Kapital and his earlier, more humanist work is definitely relevant in my opinion.

Perhaps there could be a better way of approaching this, by having a more 'Dharmic' focus. I.e. rather than just having your run of the mill political debate, why not try and approach it from a perspective more in line with the goals and objectives of this forum (as I see it), a constructive debate about Buddha Dharma, its practices and (positive) impact.

The basic principle of a free market is that consumers need to able to make informed choices. One of the things (even conservative economists used to admit this) is that people cannot make informed choices about is health care, for example. Since people cannot make informed choices about some things, these kinds of things should be strictly regulated, as they are in those countries, and Canada.

But apart from things like healthcare and education, these countries you mention do not really have centrally planned economies.

But, he said, some wars, including the Korean War and World War II, helped "protect the rest of civilization, democracy." He said he saw a similar result in Afghanistan - "perhaps some kind of liberation."

"The people themselves, I think, suffer a lot under their previous regimes," he said. But he was adamant that the United States not lose sight of rebuilding Afghanistan.

The Dalai Lama urged Bush, in a letter on Sept. 12, 2001, to "think seriously whether a violent action is the right thing to do and in the greater interest of the nation and people in the long run." Asked whether the Iraq war was just, the Dalai Lama said the situation there is "more complicated" and will take more time before he can judge.

The Dalai Lama said he had briefly raised these concerns to Bush during their meeting in the White House residence. He declined to say what Bush's response was.

The Tibetan Buddhist leader, who is a five-city, 20-day tour of the United States that is timed to coincide with the Sept. 11 anniversary, called on Americans to channel their lingering grief "into a source of inner strength."

"Big, unthinkable tragedies happen," he said. "Now, instead of keeping that and developing hatred or sense of revenge, instead of that, think long-term. The negative event, try to transform into a source of inner strength."

He likened the terrorist attacks to Tibetans' struggle to reclaim their country from Chinese rule. Communist troops took over Tibet in 1951, and the Dalai Lama fled in 1959 during a failed uprising. He now lives in India.

"In my own case, many experiences of unthinkable situations have happened, but we never lose our hope. We never let negative emotions (rule), so that's immense benefit - including my own health," said the Dalai Lama, who was hospitalized last year with stomach ailments. "More peace (of) mind, more calm mind, more compassionate mind - very good for my health!" he said with a hearty laugh.

The White House meeting irritated Chinese authorities, who said in the official China Daily newspaper that the visit to the United States "constitutes a serious intervention into China's internal affairs." Nevertheless, the Dalai Lama got an audience with Bush; Secretary of State Colin Powell and his top aide on Tibet, Paula Dobriansky; Laura Bush; White House chief of staff Andy Card; and a deputy to Vice President Dick Cheney, Scooter Libby.

The Washington-based International Campaign for Tibet, however, said it was high time Bush received the Dalai Lama in the Oval Office, not in the White House residence - a symbolic step that would signal a stronger commitment to the Dalai Lama's teachings, said John Ackerly, ICT's president.

"Our war on terrorism should include embracing nonviolent leaders, and not ushering them in through the back door of the White House," Ackerly said.

The Dalai Lama, regarded by Tibetan Buddhists as the 14th incarnation of the Buddha of compassion, broke into laughter often during the interview, even when the conversation turned to serious topics.

He laughed when he described his political role as one of "semi-retirement," when he stumbled on a word, and again when he characterized Beijing's occasional "bullying" of Tibet.

He gestured continuously, the beads on his bracelet rattling at the end of his bare arms. The 68-year-old Dalai Lama had flecks of gray in his close-cropped hair, but looked decades younger than his age.

The Dalai Lama and his followers seek greater autonomy for Tibetans while keeping the region part of China. Beijing demands that the Dalai Lama publicly renounce any claim to Tibet's independence, and says he is welcome back as a religious leader, but may have no political role.

The Dalai Lama said he saw hopeful signs of an agreement. Direct contact between his envoys and Chinese officials resumed last year after an impasse of nearly a decade.

He called China's new president, Hu Jintao - a former top Chinese official in Tibet - "cautious," but said he hoped Hu will continue a process of liberalization. But he also said he was concerned about frustration among Tibetans after decades of Chinese rule, and amid an "overwhelming" influx of Chinese into Tibet. "Not necessarily intentionally, but unintentionally, the cultural genocide is taking place," he said.

Asked whether decades of frustration could lead to violence or even terrorism, he paused. "Oh, possible," the Dalai Lama said. "But up to now, Tibetans, in spite individual views or feelings, I think generally they listen to my approach. Strictly nonviolent."

At base, what we have are two functions related to the formation of states: power and markets. All states are created to protect markets. It is the only reason they have for existence. This is very clearly pointed out in Buddhists sūtras.

One can fantasize all one wants about stateless societies, and so on, but in fact as long as there are markets, there will be states. The only way to be rid of states is to be rid of markets. That will never happen.

Mind you, I am not suggesting that capitalism is the end all be all, it isn't.

In general, one of the main reasons for the failure of so many US attempts to open markets around the world is precisely due to the fact that "free markets" do not function well in authoritarian regimes. This is why the US always ties democracy to capitalism, and in those countries where democracy fails, capitalism demonstrably fails as well in favor of the kind of mercantile economies we see in China, etc.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, I don't think this argument works. Most Germans in 1933 were not Nazis, and were not allied with Nazis. The Nazis took power because they were more belligerent, more violent, and more organized in the Catholic parts of Germany which were their stronghold. The majority of Germans at that time were either centrists or leftists, and were unable to collaborate with each other to prevent a Nazi takeover. The centrists were basically afraid of the street violence between the right and the left, and the left was distracted by their internationalist aims which were distrusted by centrists. So the centrists by default wound up backing the Nazis.

The same thing seems to happening in the USA.

Now all we need is an explanation of what “devotion to the Dharmakaya” means, ‘cause it’s not at all clear.

anjali said:
Not trying to be pedantic, but devotion means to be devoted, which in turn can mean "a feeling of strong love or loyalty", but also "an act of giving (as effort or time) to something." In this case, the way I look at devotion in a Buddhist context is as a steady flow of one's loving attention toward one's true nature (the Dharmakaya), which is inseparable from the true nature of the guru.

smcj said:
What about the Dharmakaya is worthy of devotion?

I’m assuming the connotation of adoration or love is a correct translation.


Malcolm wrote:
Depend on what Tibetan word. The Tibeten word most commonly translated as devotion is mos gus, or gus pa.

Mos gus is combined term that does not have a real Sanskrit term underneath it. It combined from mos pa and gus pa.

Mos pa only translates adhimokṣa and its various forms. It means confidence or interest. Gus pa translate two terms primarily, ādara and satkṛtya, both of which mean to pay respect.

Thus the terms we usually see translated as "devotion" really mean, "confident interest" and "respect".

Thus, when we see the term "devotion" in a Tibetan Buddhist book, we should understand that it really has nothing to do with the English history of the word, which really means "formal vow." Devotion means "love, loyalty, or enthusiasm for a person, activity, or cause:" Of these three, it is only the third definition, enthusiasm, which is really indicated by the term in its Buddhist sense. This does not bar us from having love for or loyalty to our gurus, teachers, etc. But just to be clear, we should expect love from our gurus, since the texts on the qualities of the guru all describe the guru as loving, and they in return should expect our interest and respect.

The mind-watching I've been doing for the Alan Wallace course on Dzogchen meditation has got me revisiting this old(ish) posting of mine.

The mental thingies I've been naming non-conceptual thoughts and yous guys have been re-naming vedana, or concepts, or subtle thoughts are back in the spotlight. I find them quite fascinating. They are very difficult to see in real time — generally I see them either partway through their lifespan or a moment after they are gone. And they manifest not so much as thoughts or feelings, rather: thoughts-feelings. (Hard to describe.) And when I become aware of them, it's as if they were zipped up into a very condensed zip file then unpacked. (Also hard to describe. Think of a seed suddenly revealing the entire tree.)

These subtle thought-feelings are only observable during a meditative mind state. In my normal waking state, they are hidden away beneath the threshold of my conscious awareness, i.e. in what is conventionally called my unconscious mind. During meditation, they become visible because that threshold moves, goes deeper, partway into the unconscious.

My intuitive sense is that it would be fruitful for me to dig deeper into that unconscious realm during meditation, that it will help me get closer to seeing/fathoming what's really goin' on (in) here. Sound about right?

Questions coming up from practice:

Lately in my practice I have been doing more intensive meditation and I have noted some things.

Usually in the past when bliss states have arisen they seem more of a mental variety.  I have now been experiencing the random arising of what seem like body bliss states centralized around arms and legs.  They feel like intense pleasure in some form but can almost become "painful" in their intensity and length.

I have also noted various mental and physical phenomena that before I would just in my practice have assigned as "random" but now that my practice is more centralized and focused I don't really think so much about "random".

I am starting to feel in both regards that understanding and practicing the workings of tantric buddhism in particular in regards to the "inner winds" is very important.

Anyone have any suggestions on good books, internet resources? etc?

I feel I need to study these things and then put into practice.

Norwegian said:
If you want to study and practice these things, then you need to receive empowerment, transmission, and instruction on them from a qualified teacher. There's no other alternative.

CedarTree said:
I live in a place were that is not such a option or at least that I would have to look into it.

I also find that a lot of "teachers" don't seem so progressed in actual intensive meditation and practice.  I like reading and studying on my own and having some basis to understand by my own objective reasoning.

This isn't a criticism of teachers as I value many teachers greatly from various traditions but I think being able to read books, compare presentations, put into practice, etc.  That is paramount.  At least it has seemed to be in my life.

Because of the Versailles Treaty, Germany was forced to pay reparations. This led to out of control inflation in Germany during the Weimar Republic. Germany reneged on its repayments, which in turn caused British and French banks to panic. Unable to meet their obligation to American Banks (from which they had borrowed heavily in the War), this caused the American stock market collapse in 1929. Emboldened by the incompetence of Weimar Republic, as well as the inability of the other parties to muster a solid response to the economic climate of Germany, in this fractured political and economic environment the Nazis skated into Parliament by the skin of their teeth. The rest is history, and the cause of it all is the humiliation Germans felt because of the Versailles Treaty. The Great Depression, in other words, was a direct consequence of the Versailles treaty. At least, this is what I learned at Harvard.

And, when it comes down to it, those that practice hate speech are normally those that would be the first to revoke the right to freedom of speech once they gain power.  They use (currently existing) democratic rights to undermine democracy.  History has shown this to be true a number of times.

Malcolm wrote:
Indeed, Karl Popper pointed this out:

Grigoris said:
“The so-called paradox of freedom is the argument that freedom in the sense of absence of any constraining control must lead to very great restraint, since it makes the bully free to enslave the meek. The idea is, in a slightly different form, and with very different tendency, clearly expressed in Plato.

Less well known is the paradox of tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. — In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.”

I mean, what is the point of this? Why should a women who has suffered sexual harassment from Tibetans who are acting in the role of spiritual guides care about their cultural perspective? It is obvious that the Tibetan cultural perspective devalues women. This is all we need to know. We all know what the cultural context is. Tibet is a culture where one of the commonly used names for women means "inferior birth" ( skye dman ).

It really is on a scale not seen since the Nazis. And incidentally, Daesh arose from the oppressor class in Iraq.

Yes, of course we can blame the US and its allies (mainly Britain) for so totally destabilizing the region. But it is not reasonable to pretend it is someone else problem. We live in a single world. People who committed war crimes on all sides should be held to account. But Daesh is a special case. Feeding infants to their mothers, setting up slave markets, etc., this is beyond the even the worst crimes of the Syrians, and so on. There is the brutalism of the Baathists such as Assad and Hussein, but then there is the sheer insanity of Daesh. The latter is in a special class all its own, not seen since the Nazis.

So if you feel compelled to be either directly involved or simply emotionally invested in the drama, go ahead. Somebody has to do it. But the best you can do is set the stage for the next set of problems that needs addressing. That’s the most you can accomplish in samsara. And there’s a good chance you will create a lot of negative karmic connections with a huge assortment of beings.

So if that’s your choice, fine. But my understanding is that the Teachings tell me to choose differently.

It is the best foundation for world peace, the equitable use of natural resources, and through concern for future generations, the proper care of the environment.

We are inside that loop. We pay taxes to a government that prosecutes those wars. We can pretend that we are free of complicity, but really, we aren't.

Our very lifestyle in the first world caused this. Neoliberal ideology supposes that if we just spread capitalism (under the guise of Democracy) on a wide enough scale, fast enough, everyone will be pacified with commodities. Of course this is not going to happen.

So these wars result. Amongst the people fighting these wars are those on both sides who use toxic ideologies to promote their cause. Some are more toxic than others.

Sooner or later human beings as a whole are going to have to accept that we live on a planet with limited resources that need to be equitably distributed to all.

But I don't see this happening, what I see happening is that we are just moving deeper and deeper into the Kali Yuga, and that about the best we can do is all palliative.

It has been a tremendous waste of lives and resources. But the other sad fact is that the international community cannot simply sit idly by and watch those regions be ravaged by fanatics. We have an ethical obligation to support stable governments in the region who are able to come to some kind of internal balance, a problem that is still on going with the brewing four-way fight between Kurds, Iraqis, Turks, and Syrians, five, if one counts Iran.

It was not a trap, not intentional anyway...  The reality is that from a drone the closest you'll get to knowing if somebody is a member of ISIS is if you see somebody with an assault rifle, a beard and a turban.  In rural Syria that is about 80% of the adult male population.

AND I am not only doubting if all ISIS members are suitable objects for liberation, I am also doubting whether the subjects that are liberating are suitable too.  It seems to me that by agreeing to drone strikes you are setting up drone operators for rebirth in the three lower realms; since their motivation is unlikely to be bodhicitta and they will not be engaging in the correct practices when blowing people into tiny pieces.  They will just be commiting plain and ordinary murder.

So it is my opinion that your view is completely mistaken and lacking in compassion, as it is setting up the causes and conditions for both the subjects and objects of the actions, to experience horrendous future suffering.

We will all have to be vigilant for the next 100 years to make sure this kind of poison does not spread again.

They wanted to see a wholesale collapse of the present economic system - a reset based on what they consider tangible value - hard work, ingenuity, GOLD. When the complete collapse didn't happen, they focused their anger on Obama because he stood in the way, bailing out people who took more loan than they could afford, as well as the banks that set up the macro-architecture of the whole scheme - mortgage backed securities.

You are basically accusing Guru Rinpoche of being involved in a kind of ethnic cleansing. I am quoting the translation of the Barchey Lamsel text. The word they use is "destroyed".
You mean this line? It is the only mention of Bon:

10) Having done the accomplishment at Samye Chimphu,
repelled negative conditions and bestowed siddhi,
you placed the king and ministers on the path of liberation,
the teaching of the Bon’s demonic forms declined,
and the teaching of the precious immaculate dharmakāya
placed the fortunate on the stage of buddhahood.

gdon gzugs bon gyi bstan pa bsnubs.

The word in the text is bsnubs. It means either "med par gtong ba," "sent into nonexistence"  or "nub par byed pa", "caused to decline."

It does not have the strong connotations of other Tibetan words, such as 'joms, to conquer, brlag pa, to crush.

The commentary by Dilgo Khyentse on this line states that the Bonpos were defeated in debate by Padmsambhava and Shantarakshita through citation and reasoning. They were then exiled by royal decree, and their teaching disappeared.

If you look at the broader history, this refers to a faction in the Tibetan court of Trisong Detsen that maintained connections to the overthrown Zhang Zhung kingdom whose power over Tibet had been shrugged off a century before when Srong Tsan Gampo engineered the assassination of King Ligmincha. "Bonpos" then are not the Bonpos we have today. And in other Kathang literature, we have clear examples of Padmasambhava interceding on behalf of some Bonpos whose practices did not involve animal and human sacrifice, so called "good Bonpos." So here, the so called "Bonpos" who were exiled were a specific political faction of Tibetans.

Right.

Within Vajrayāna, there are ten criteria which must be fully met for a sentient being to be considered eligible for such liberation: 1) they harm the doctrine, 2) they despise the Three Jewels, 3) they rob the Sangha 4) they despise Mahāyāna 5) they harm the body of the guru, 6) they destroy the vajra family, 7) they cause obsctacles to practice, 8) they utterly lack love and compassion, 9) they are utterly divorced from samaya vows, and 10) they have a false view of the result of karma.

Not just in my opinion. As before.

Atisha states:
If one has an evil guru or an evil friend, one will be harmed by both.
Mokṣākaragupta mentions in the Dohakoṣapañjikā-nāma:
It is risky to consider evil gurus to be one's guru. Since one relies on such a one, the fault is that one begins to have evil views and evil behavior. One should avoid such gurus as one would a snake.

These are all admonitions to avoid evil gurus. No argument there. You need to have citations saying that it is ok to break samaya with a guru once you have made a commitment to him.

Malcolm wrote:
No, Moksakara's advice clearly means that once you have understood this or that person to be evil, you shun them. You cannot break samaya with someone who is not qualified to bestow samaya or who has broken their own samaya. As the Rig pa Ranshar states:

smcj said:
If the master breaks samaya, there is no method of purification.


Malcolm wrote:
If one has broken samaya, one has no samaya to give.


Khenchen Ngalo states:

smcj said:
Furthermore, as previously explained, after one has requested Dharma and empowerments from a reliable, qualified vajramaster guru, despising him with thoughts such as, “ this one’s discipline is corrupt,” “this one’s diligence is weak,” “he is confused” and so on is likened to despising all the buddhas.

Malcolm wrote:
If someone discovers their guru is not qualified, there is no obligation to continue to follow such a guru at all, or regard them as pure and so on.

What is a qualified guru? Again, Khenchen Ngalo comments:

smcj said:
it is definitely necessary that the guru has obtained the empowerment, possesses the lineage, is pure, all of his practices accord with the tantra division because he understands the meaning of the tantras, has completed the approach and accomplishment, guards the supreme samayas of the four empowerments like his life, is adorned with many intimate instructions [man ngag, upadeśa] of nāḍīs, vāyus, dreams, etc., which correspond with the tantras, whose continuum is moistened with love, compassion, and bodhicitta, and who knows many scriptures and treatises of sūtra and tantra.

Well, it kind of follows, if one has actual conviction in a lama being a "Khyentse." then one wouldn't be so inclined to view their actions through an ordinary lens.

It was you who mentioned a quote about Guru's being a mix of positive qualities and faults, which was obviously to undermine my post that surprise surprise enlightened activities could manifest even in ways not everyone understands!

Malcolm wrote:
It was a reality check sourced from an authoritative commentary on a major tantra. It is a citation which I stand by. There is no living person alive today, in this Kali Yuga, who is completely free of misdeeds. Therefore, when picking a guru, one must see whether their qualities far outweigh their faults. This is much more reliable method for choosing a guru than chasing tulku titles. Of course, having chosen a guru, one must endeavor to see their minor flaws as teaching methods.

Sonam Wangchug said:
In reality, when these conversations crop up, I think it bears reminder, the tremendous confidence in which these lama's who are MOST of our refuges have placed in Rinpoche.

Malcolm wrote:
There is no tantra or sūtra anywhere that mentions a system of tulku recognition through dreams, divinations, oracles or any other means.

Sonam Wangchug said:
Why it is relevant, has to do with actions coming either from realization or confusion. While of course, a lama can become realized in the course of that lifetime, if indeed we are convinced of their being recognized by someone with less cognitive veils as a nirmanakaya then that helps.

Malcolm wrote:
It involves a chain of authority, and is not immune to Āryadeva's critcism of relying on claims of royal paternity.

Furthermore, according to Guru Padmasambhava in the Transcendent State of Samantabhadra cycle of teachings, an actual nirmanakāya is fully conscious when conceived, throughout the term of gestation, and through their birth. Bodhisattvas on the stages are conscious of being conceived, and are conscious throughout gestation, but lose consciousness at the time of birth. Ordinary sentient beings are conscious of being conceived, but are not aware throughout their gestation, and do not recall being born.

I doubt that the hardliners against Rinpoche will change their stances no matter who says what, but in the sea of this trend of aversion I just seek to offer another angle which I know ( though not everyone publicly shares it) others feel.

Malcolm wrote:
You are confused. I am not a hardliner who has arrayed themselves against anyone, least of all Dzongsar Khyentse. He is a qualified teacher, well trained and educated. That's enough in itself without all the extra baggage of tulkuhood.

I am totally skeptical of the tulku recognition system, something I have never hidden, ever. I consider the system of tulku recognition to be a Tibetan cultural custom, and that as a cultural practice, it is often is carried out in ways that are inconsistent with the Dharma. This is not to say this social strategy on the part of Tibetans to manage inheritance and lineage transmission has always been unsuccessful. However, there is a within Tibetan literature much fun poked at tulkus, and not a little healthy skepticism. For example Paltrul Rinpoche ironically notes in the The Oral Advice of Guru Samantabhadra:

Sonam Wangchug said:
Although they have not even the slightest qualities of hearing, reflection, and meditation in their continuums, they think they are better than others— “I am a guru,” or similarly, “I am a reincarnation,” “I am a bodhisattva,” “I am a master,” and so on. Furthermore, they also consider “My family is like that,” guarding their family like brahmins. Alternately, even though they have modest qualities of hearing, reflection, and meditation, [8/a] they do not practice with pure motivation for the benefit of future lives but do so for this life fearing personal loss such as the residence of the guru and so on. Like a grindstone made of wood, they do not have the ability to tame the continuums of disciples.

Though their own continuums lack even the modest qualities that should make them better than common people, other fools have faith in them, according them status without examining them. Their continuums are bloated with acquisitions and respect....

Malcolm wrote:
It is the Sogyals, Segals, and Burroughs of the world that should give one pause about tulku recognitions in general, not to mention the Fifth Dalai Lama's autobiographical account of how he was fraudulently recognized as the reincarnation of the fourth Dalai Lama by the regent, Sonam Rabten (1595–1658).

I therefore claim that teachers and gurus need to be examined based on their own character and deeds, rather than their titles, no matter how lofty or awakened the person handing out such recognitions may seem to us.

I am sure too you are familiar with the story of Khyentse Wangpo becoming tired of the doubts of a recently deceased lama's disciples. Since they had doubts about the recognized tulku, Khyentse took them to a barn, called out the lamas name, and when a calf answered, he said, "This is your actual Lama."

BTW, I have no interest in debating the authenticity of Dzongsar's recognition. You brought that up. I have no idea why, actually. But it is your trip, not mine. I am quite happy for the positive things that he does, like the 84,000 project and so on.  I frankly don't care whether he is an "authentic" tulku or not. It would never enter my mind to select a teacher based on their tulku recognition status. It would never enter my mind to do so because such a criteria is just not important to me at all.

If a 12- or 16-year-old girl cannot be found, a 20-year-old will suffice, advises another text, and continues, “One should offer his sister, daughter or wife to the ‘guru’”, then the more valuable the mudra is to the pupil, the more she serves as a gift for his master (Wayman, 1977, p. 320).

I fail to see how my way of thinking and Tathagatagarbha are mutually exclusive.  Actually it would seem the complete opposite:  Because one has Tathagatagarbha that means they don't need to be born anywhere in particular to achieve enlightenment.

Malcolm wrote:
If one accepts Mahāyāna, one accepts that in order to attain buddhahood according to the common Mahāyāna path, one must traverse five paths and the ten bodhisattvas stages for a minimum of ten incalculable eons.

On the three pure stages, one no longer resides in the desire realm, but in various form realm heavens, as well as the buddhafield of Ghanavyuha.

A supreme nirmanakāya will, in their last birth prior to manifesting supreme buddhahood, reside as the bodhisattva Svetaketu (really a title more than a name) teaching the Tushita gods. They will then select a family from either the merchant, warrior, or priestly family and descend into the mother's womb and display the 12 deeds.

It may be objected that a tenth stage bodhisattva is not a buddha, but in fact Maitreyanath states, "that stage beyond the ninth stage is a stage of buddhahood." And even so, as the Lanka states, "The actual buddha (the samboghakāya) attains awakening in Akaniṣṭha, the nirmanakāya displays the attainment of buddha here."

All mandalas such as Vajrakīlaya, Kalacakra, etc., are in fact symbolic representations of Akaniṣṭha Ghanavyhua, which is why one can in this body attain buddhahood in this lifetime providing one is an extremely diligent practitioner. In other words when you perfect the creation stage as an ārya bodhisattva, you are abiding in the samadhi of Akaniṣṭha, and therefore, through the completion stage, one can attain buddhist in this life time in this very body.

This of course is a complete non-starter for a liberal westerner.

My understanding of the theoretical framework for how and why this is appropriate comes mostly from private conversations with my own teachers. I will start with a couple of credited quotes.

Lama Phuntsok (Kagyu/Toronto) gave me two separate analogies for guru yoga. The first was that the radiance of the Dharmakaya was like sunshine, and our practice was like a piece of paper that we are trying to light on fire. The sunshine will not be able to set the paper on fire without a magnifying glass. In this analogy the guru acts like a magnifying glass to focus the sun's rays.

Malcolm wrote:

The second analogy starts with the understanding that what we are really devoted towards is the Dharmakaya.

Yes. This is the basis of the whole system of tulkus, actually. A genuine tulku seems to be an ordinary person who goes through the stages of the path, but in reality they fully woke up in their previous lives.
Shakyamuni Buddha was a human that achieved Buddhahood and thus humans are capable of achieving Buddhahood in this lifetime, is a MUCH easier concept for me to wrap my head around.

Otherwise, there is what is known as the yoga of passion, where one's partner and oneself engage in lovemaking in the form of the one's chosen deity.

Also, from a Dzogchen point of view, karmamudra and other practices which try to harness desire are generally viewed as being expedients for people with excessive desire in until they are ready for serious practice. Also, from a Dzogchen perspective, the benefit of karmamudra practice is only for men due to differences in male and female biology (i.e., female orgasm is not connected with ejaculation).

Inspired by the discussion in this thread:

Nobody's perfect. Suppose you're testing a teacher and notice certain faults in his behaviour. Which kinds of faults of a teacher are harmless and which are actually "contaminating" the transmissions he could possibly give, so that it is not advisable to take initiations from him?

Are there objective rules or is it all just wishy-washy as in "if you see the teacher as perfect anything goes"?

Malcolm wrote:
The rule is, if a teacher's faults outweigh their qualities by a large margin, then that is a teacher to avoid. If a teacher's qualities outweigh their faults by a large margin, then this is a teacher one might consider adopting. If a teacher's faults are in even proportion to their qualities, also this is a teacher to avoid.

If a teacher's activities are largely harmful to the Dharma, such a promulgating mistaken views and practices,  engaging in political violence to subdue religious enemies, harming disciples through inappropriate actions and so on, then one can consider this person a mad guide, someone whose very lineage must be avoided.

For example, there was a conflict between the terton Nyima Drakpa and the Yonge Terton, Mingyur Dorje. To this day many Nyingmapas will not receive the transmission of any of Yonge Mingyur Dorje treasures. Likewise, many Kagyus avoid the transmission of Nyima Drakpa's transmission of the Karling Zhitro, etc. For many centuries, Ngorpas avoided receiving the transmission of Lamdre and Naro Khacho from the Tshar subschool, and so on.

Things only appear this way due to your ontological misapprehensions. There is no "place" beyond "here" and no "here." There is no other place and time and this place and time are shunyata.

You must think the Buddha had ontological misapprehensions, he constantly spoke of places, both here and beyond here, and in time as well. To deny this is foolish, and to try and explain it away, trite. The emptiness of things in no way contradicts their appearance and order.

Ah, sorry, misunderstanding. I thought you were alluding to something. I've received teachings from Jhado Rinpoche in a local Gelug center that is highly critical in this regard, if there was the slightest doubt that Jhado Rinpoche might be involved in obscure practices they would have never invited him. And I think the same can be said about the FPMT. Also, Jhado is connected very closely to the Dalai Lama and the Namgyal Monastery.

This is why Nichiren could refer to Sadaparibhuta's twenty-four character Lotus Sutra. Alternatively, he could entertain, somewhat skeptically, the notion that the Mahavairocana Sutra is the Lotus with mudras and mantras. That in some places, the Lotus Sutra is taught in fragrances. In other places it is billions of volumes long, and why for him, it was only 5 or 7 characters.

There is a collection of essays on the Lotus Sutra called "The Buddhist Kaleidoscope." The title itself invokes this idea that the Lotus is ever adaptive. In there is an essay suggesting that the structure of the text itself lends itself to the reader reading themselves into the text... I picture it something like the little boy in Never Ending Story getting to the point in the book where he is reading about himself reading the book. The text does not remain on the page, but pours forth, bleeding into the world in which it is found. And that's how the text actually describes itself.

From a literature perspective, its brilliant story telling. As a dharma text, its the embodiment of the very upaya it describes.

It should be pointed out here, though, that Thubten is not reacting to a Chinese interpretation of the sutra, but the sutra itself. In fact he had to go back and check the Tibetan translation to be sure what he was reading in English, presumably translated from the Chinese, was accurate.

Malcolm wrote:
My point is that the later (post Yogacara) Indian tradition took a synthetic and systematic view where the sūtras were viewed as raw material out of which systemic approaches to the Dharma were elaborated, and sūtra exegesis became subordinate to these Indian philosophical schools. For example, take the disregard with which Madhyamaka would treat Yogacara sūtra sources, etc.

I have also observed Tibetans being quite surprised at what is actually stated in this or that tantra, because Tibetans in general depend on scholastic manuals for everything, rather than primary materials. It is only the expert senior scholars who work with primary materials.

Thubten's lack of familiarity with the Lotus Sūtra is normal. However the assumptions of the one yāna teaching presented in the Lotus Sūtra is very much present in Tibetan Buddhism, explicitly based on that sūtra.

The reason why such a monk might be surprised by such a teaching has to do with the fact that for the most part Tibetan and Indian Buddhist scholars tended to rely on commentaries; whereas Chinese Buddhists preferred to rely on sūtras directly. Since the latter did so, various forms of Buddhism arose unique to China, with assumptions about Dharma Indians, and later Tibetans, apparently never would hold.

I guess it all comes down to the belief that the LS is the definitive teaching of the Buddhas, who are all, in this framework, conceived of as identical to Śākyamuni Buddha.

Because of this differing perspective of Lotus Buddhism, all Buddhas (I still can't bring myself to type 'sarvabuddhāḥ' for some reason, I suppose there is a limit to even my own pretentiousness), and all Buddha-nature, are not only referred to as, but are also conceived of as, identical completely to Śākyamuni Buddha & Śākyamuni Buddha's respectively, who, in this context, is not a (normal Mahāyāna) nirmāṇakāya because of the constraints and limitations applied to such nirmāṇakāyāḥ. The LS differently presents the nirmāṇakāya. If one approaches Śākyamuni Buddha under the presumptions normative for a nirmāṇakāya in non-LS Buddhism, than one basically gets a huge Buddhist heresy.

Thoughts? Is this off the mark completely?

There cannot be. All buddhas started out as ordinary sentient beings. Śākyamuni's career began in the hell realms, in fact.

The dharmakāya is the definitive buddha because dharmakāya is a buddha's realization of the dharmadhātu.

Buddhahood, in other word, is the realization that produces the qualities we associated with Buddhas.

Malcolm wrote:
It has to do with the difference between the Tibetan translation and the Sanskrit original. The Tibetan term is rung ba, which means suitable, proper, but also possible, in the sense of one can do this or that. The Sanskrit term here is more restrictive. The first time I wrote down the quote, I wrote it down hastily based on my memory of the Tibetan verse; but Sherab is correcet, if everything were possible because of emptiness, then buddhahood could revert, etc., corn could become wheat, and that is not what the verse intends. So i went back to the Sanskrit and looked at Buddhapalita's commentary for clarification.

Just worked through Chapter 18 (in Garfield's Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way ). This verse seems to get at what I'm exploring here:

8. Everything is real and is not real,
Both real and not real.
Neither real nor not real.
This is Lord Buddha’s teaching.

Here is (part of) Garfield's commentary on the verse. I included it because, without understanding the two senses (Two Truths) that underlie the verse, it's easy to misunderstand what Nagarjuna meant.

This is the positive tetralemma regarding existence.
Everything is conventionally real. Everything is ultimately unreal.
Everything has both characteristics — that is, everything is both conventionally real and ultimately unreal.
Nothing is ultimately real or completely nonexistent. That is, everything is neither real in one sense nor not-real in another sense.
Applying this to self yields:
Self is conventionally real. Self is ultimately unreal.
Self is both conventionally real and ultimately unreal.
Self is neither ultimately real, nor conventionally unreal.
The same logic can be applied to all objects: aggregates, teachings (karma, dependent arising, rebirth), things (trees, rocks, ideas).

Malcolm wrote:
But this is quite a different use than what you originally advanced: self, no self, both, and neither.

Anyway, it really should be:

8. Everything is true, false,
both true and false,
and neither true nor false.
This is Lord Buddha’s teaching.

However, the traditional understanding is that the first term, "everything is true and false," means that the Buddha follows mundane convention and proclaims it to be true. If something is not true according to worldly convention, the Buddha proclaims it to be false. If the world says that something is both true and false, also the Buddha agrees. And if the world says something is neither true nor false, again Buddha agrees.

Buddhapalita then uses the example of pictures on a wall. Let's use the Buddha. There is a picture on the wall of Buddha, so we agree it is Buddha. But it is false if one says this is the real Buddha. It is both true and false in that it is true it is picture and it is false in that it is not the real Buddha. It is not a real buddha, hence not true,  but it is also not not a representation of someone other than Buddha, hence not false. This is the sense in which that statement should be understood.

This also is course the reason eighth stage bodhisattvas and so in general do not take birth in the desire realm birth prior to manifesting the play of the twelve deeds of a supreme nirmanakaȳa buddha.

So when I look at these words popping up on this computer screen, the words (and the screen (and the looker = me)) have no self, no essence, no ultimate identity. But, that's only half the story. The rest: Neither do the words/screen/looker have non-self, no essence, no ultimate identity.

I'm asking this because "having no self" is a cornerstone of Buddhist teaching. But, again, per the Madhyamaka (and the Heart Sutra, if I'm reading it correctly) it seems like just a half-truth.


Malcolm wrote:
It is a half-truth — ordinary beings do not perceive absence of identity in persons and phenomena. This is called the relative. But when persons and things are perceived as they truly exist, no identity of persons and things can be perceived at all. Thus "self" is relative, and "no self" is ultimate. In other words, it is perfectly fine to denote composite things with names; but those names do not correspond to anything intrinsically real within that composite entity.

Of course, if your teacher comes to visit you in the hospital, gives you ten bucks, gives you an amulet, a mantra, a ride, and so on, all of these can be called "a blessing," albeit, very temporary. Buddha, having passed away centuries ago, cannot actively give you blessings, other than the teachings he has left behind which we may study and thus edify ourselves, and through the lineage of teachers whom he proclaims are to be understood as his emanations.

Yeah, he says some funny stuff about tetrahedrons and other new age sounding stuff, but it seems that through acting, Jim Carey had an initial experience of Anatta. Amusingly, to most commentators, he appears to be "crazy", and almost every article I read just dismisses him as such.

For myself at least, it was just such an experience that solidified my interest in Dharma, mine came from working at weddings all the time, one day I just couldn't get over the "this is not real", "this is like a play" feeling when I was watching people dance, hobnob, put on airs, etc.

Anyway, despite being kind of disjointed, I felt like his words actually had some wisdom, and he says some things that are -exactly- what these people need to hear.. and the reaction to them says a lot about our society. Their reaction to his words really makes clear the vapidity of celebrity culture.

Later on someone asks him about the interview and he says:
‘Who’s Jim Carrey? Oh, he doesn’t exist actually.’ There’s just a relative manifestation of consciousness appearing, and someone gave him a name, a religion, a nationality, and he clustered those together into something that’s supposed to be a personality, and it doesn’t actually exist. None of that stuff, if you drill down, is real.”

As a Christian I distinguished between being “christian” (one who acts like Christ) and being “a Christian” (one who belongs to a church). As a Buddhist my spirituality is seeking liberation, but my religion is the specific teachings and practices I used to enable that effort.

All they can do is teach. That is all Buddhas and bodhisattvas can really do to help sentient beings. It is well known that when one does wealth practice for example, one is using up ones own merit of wealth in the process unless one very carefully dedicates one's practice to make the merit of practice inexhaustible.

Vasana said:
So if they have continuums, they are spontaneously active for the benefit of beings. I doubt the continuum of the Bodhisattva Tara is inactive. If even Bodhisattvas on the first bhumi can emanate 100 emanations, then they're already 'doing' a lot to help sentient beings even without grasping at self-natures, persons,lifepsan, self etc.

Malcolm wrote:
Actually, they emanate 100 emanations to go visit buddhas to receive teachings.



Vasana said:
As for beliefs and merit, this is why I said that I personally think that Thugs rje and the blessings of Buddhas is a two way street. Our capacity for liberation, compassionate aspirations, merit,karma , invocations, vows and samayas along with their compassionate nature, previous vows and samayas all serve as necessary co-emergent factors for the ongoing appearance of dreamlike beneficial deeds. So long as beings have merit and interest, they appear.

Malcolm wrote:
So you are basically admitting the compassion of buddhas is obstructed by the lack of merit of hell beings, for example.

Like I said, I can relate to Tara in more ways than one without it really being a problem for me or my practice just as the outer and inner tantras have more or less refined takes on deities and jnanasattvas without there being contradiction in the 9 yanas.

Minds can influence other minds, as in the case of the lady who thought herself a tiger and terrified a village. If the villagers didn't have the karma to be afraid of a tiger or the traces to give rise to the impression of that tiger, they would have a different reaction.

Similarly, a buddha proffers help unconditionally, however it is dependent on an individual's karma etc. to be receptive to it.

Malcolm wrote:
You missed the point of that example. Shabkar, for example, uses it to point out that strong traces in other people's minds can generate perceptions in our own minds.

As to your second statement, this merely proves my point. Buddhas are powerless to help sentient beings in any kind of material way. What Buddhas can do is teach the Dharma. That is all they need to do.

Innermost Tara/Guru as your own state doesn't invalidate any timely intervention any 'outer' Tara may offer, even if her form and actions are llusory appearances governed by non dual wisdom. Until you're unwavering in your own state of Dzogchen/Tara, the outer Tara will still be there. Didn't you also once say that deities like Tara, Manjushri still possess their own mindstreams?  How does that tie in to it?

I'm sure you've also read the stories of how a given Deity has manifested very tangible benefit, assistance in people's lives etc.

Maybe my opinions and understanding on all of this may change in time but I personally find more benefit and it rings truer for me personally to relate to Deities like Tara in multiple ways without there needing to be conflict between them.

Somehow you are committed to the idea of conventionally valid, external rūpakāyas hanging around to benefit beings. My point is that you are reifying buddhas and sentient beings as existents, rather that seeing them for what they are, illusions. Once one understands everything is absolutely equivalent to an illusion, one's anxiety about such matters begins to diminish.

Some people think when they receive an empowerment that they are making a commitment in the sense of making a promise to another person. But that is a very catechistic and naive concept of samaya.

The real samaya of a practitioner is to discover their own state, and that is neither a religious nor a spiritual endeavor. It is however what one does if one is a Dharma practitioner. We really need to drop these western religious terms in our reception of Buddhadharma. This is why I seldom use such terms in my own translations.

From a practical point of view, what it means for me is that something is deserving of my reverence, and I feel and know it at a deep level. Of all paths, do we not declare the Buddhadharma to be deserving of utmost reverence, and, in a sense, sacred above all other paths--at least for us?

The first derivation is from the Latin word 'religio' meaning 'attitude of awe towards the Gods'.

The second derivation is from 'religare', which is rather less straightforward. The 'ligare' in that word is the same root as 'ligament', so 'religare' means 're-joining' or 'binding'.

Greg, If you can believe that sentient beings have distinct mindstreams and distinct karmas then can you believe that Buddha's, Bodhisattvas etc have their own mental continuums distinct from our own? The mental continuums of beings are alike in escence and nature but when you encounter somebody else in the street, that person possesses their own continuum seperate from yours even if for you, that other person is an appearance wihin your mind. How is what you seem to be suggesting not a kind of mind-only take or solipsism?

If you say that the continuums of Buddhas and beings are not distinct, then why are beings not already Buddhas in anything other than unripened seed or potential? If you agree that they are distinguishable in terms of the prescence or absence of grasping at signs, then why would it be wrong to suggest that buddhas and emanations manifest in dependence with the needs of beings without having ever left the natural state of wisdom free of grasping?  How could we account for the various manifestations of the sambogakaya if there were not some discriminating faculty Buddha's possess in knowing which forms are best suited to guide or subdue particular beings?

Maybe this is all getting lost in translation and is really down to the trouble of balancing conventions with the ultimate?

Only Abidharma tries to account for rebirth, at the sūtra level.

The fragment ends with Sujato and Batchelor agreeing the precise mechanism of rebirth is not explained very extensively in the sutras. Is this the reason the different abhidharmic solutions are lacking coherency, i.e. the lack of detailed mention in the sutras of the mechanism of rebirth?

Malcolm wrote:
Yes. Those who reject rebirth usually reject it on the basis of sutrayāna Buddhists not being able to provide a clear medium of transference between this life and the next, and disagreements over what the Buddha meant with the term ghandharva.

I couldn't find the english translation of this passage online (and neither the German original, btw.) but since we're discussing a German philosopher here,  a German quote by one of his critics is hopefully not out of place:
Daß Heidegger am Wahrheitsbegriff, wenngleich in der angedeuteten schillernden Weise, immerhin festgehalten hat, kann als Indiz dafür gewertet werden, daß, wie ich vorhin behauptet habe, sogar Heideggers entrationalisierte Konzeption noch unbemerkt vom Vernunftbezug lebt. Wohin aber diese entrationalisierte Konzeption von Wahl und der entrationalisierte Wahrheitsbegriff führen kann, läßt sich an einer Rede sehen, die Heidegger im November 1933 zur Unterstützung von Hitler vor dem Volksreferendum zum Austritt aus dem Völkerbund gehalten hat. Sie beginnt so: "Das deutsche Volk ist vom Führer zur Wahl gerufen; der Führer aber erbittet nichts vom Volke, er gibt vielmehr dem Volke die unmittelbare Möglichkeit der höchsten freien Entscheidung, ob das ganze Volk sein Dasein will, oder ob es dieses nicht will. Das Volk wählt morgen nichts Geringeres als seine Zukunft." Und dann heißt es: "Was ist das also für ein Geschehen? Das Volk gewinnt die Wahrheit seines Daseinswillens zurück, denn Wahrheit ist die Offenbarkeit dessen, was ein Volk in seinem Handeln und Wissen sicher, hell und stark macht." [3]  Diese Zitate zeigen, daß Heideggers Nazismus keine zufällige Angelegenheit war, sondern daß ein direkter Weg von seiner Philosophie - von seinem entrationalisierten Wahrheitsbegriff und dem von diesem bestimmten Begriff der Selbstbestimmung - zum Nazismus führte. Und doch würden wir auf philosophische Einsichten verzichten, wenn wir deswegen nicht von Heidegger lernen wollten, was wir von ihm lernen können. Es kommt darauf an, die genaue Stelle zu sehen, die zum Irrationalismus führte und nicht das Kind mit dem Bade auszuschütten."
Ernst Tugendhat, Selbstbewußtsein und Selbstbestimmung, Seite 243 (Last paragraph of lecture no 10)

(Maybe somebody has the english edition, Self-consciousness and self-determination?)

I like Negative Dialectics by Adorno who proves that Heidegger's thought is through going philosophical fascism:

One infamous example could also be Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who gave his own children to an orphanage and wrote books about love, compassion and education. But on a sidenote, in the case of Heidegger it is highly controversial among philosophers if his philosophical theory can or cannot be seen in isolation from his Nazism.

They later become very involved in the international white supremacy movement. This became evident when they released their second album in 1984, Hail the New Dawn.

I just want you to understand that given the low density of population in the US, though it may seem on TV we are glutting ourselves on an orgy of violence, the reality is quite different.

Gun culture in this country is determined at the state level because that is where guns are regulated, apart from automatic weapons, which are illegal for civilians to own according to federal law.

To put it another way, people who really, really like guns are less likely to live in a state like Massachusetts or Hawaii where gun laws are very stringent. You are more likely to find them in Vermont or Nevada where rates of gun deaths are much higher.

Malcolm wrote:
Oh the stats are quite real, no question. They just do not apply everywhere in the US.

For example, I live in Massachusetts with among the strictest gun control laws in the country, and one of the lowest gun violence rates as well, comparable to Europe. The gun death rate for Massachusetts in 2015 was 3.13 per 100K, which is comparable with your country, which has an average gun death rate of about 3.01 per 100K per year, and lower than Finland, at 3.25 per 100k in 2013.

For example, it is very difficult to get a concealed carry license here, and in Boston, if you want to take your gun to the range to shoot it, you have to call the police and inform them that you are traveling with your weapon (this does not apply however to nonurban areas where the regulations are slightly looser, but not by much).

Another thing to keep in mind that is that half of the guns in the US are owned by just 3% of the population.

Gun ownership is also declining as hunting is becoming less popular.

So, understanding gun death rates in the US should be done on a state by state basis, not country wide. If you consider the whole country, you will be mislead by the stats and make incorrect inferences about the level of violence in one state as opposed to another state.

Carrying a gun is not bad karma.

Malcolm wrote:
Carrying weapons predisposes one to violence with those weapons. One will not carry a gun or other deadly weapon unless one has some aggressive impulses or fear leading to such impulses.

Karma begins in the mind. Just the act of carrying a gun means that one has already engaged in one of the three mental nonvirtues. If someone is not prepared to kill a human being, they should never carry a gun. If someone is carrying a gun, this means they are prepared to kill another human being, or in the case of hunters, other sentient beings. I would therefore argue that owning and carrying guns and weapons is automatically bad karma.

Buddha taught very clearly that those who die fighting never experience any of the three higher states of rebirth in their next life, even if the war they are in is a so called "just war."

Malcolm wrote:
It is a completely wrong view.

The Buddhist teaching about such things is that every sentient being, mosquitos included, has a unique mind stream with its own set of causes and conditions, it's own accumulation of karma and ripening of karma.

With respect to the term bla, today it means more or less vitality. In ancient pre-buddhist traditions in Tibet, it is a rather complicated subject; commonly however today in the Buddhist context, bla is understood to be synonym for consciousness (Tibetan Medicine) or an alternate term for lifeforce. So called "soul retrieval" (bla 'gugs) rites are in reality little more than rites for summoning the vitality of the five elements to reinforce one's own five elements.

There is also a medical condition called bla 'khyams,  "wandering bla," which is diagnosed in people who exhibit dissociative disorders, especially from trauma. There is also the idea that provocations, spirits, can steal one's bla, which results in a kind of wasting disease.

With respect to the idea of an awakened master transferring their "mind" (thugs) to a disciple, this is a form of blessing. It does not mean that now the student has all the teachers thoughts and knowledge, memories, experiences, and so on.

Well, when I read the article below I was quite bewildered - Master Hsuan Hua basically said that a person would go through rebirth as multiple animals or plants simultaneously due to his 'soul' being fragmented. In some other articles I read, he mentioned that these fragmented souls would need to join together again to take rebirth at a higher forms (e.g. multiple roosters' souls need to be integrated together to reborn as a horse, then multiple horse's souls then integrate to be a human.)

Controversial and contradictory as it sounds to me, I have not been able to convince myself to disregard this notion - being fragmented into multiple animals and even plants - and it's been bothering me. The fact that he mentioned this came from his "Five Eyes" capability. My search to invalidate this to convince and calm my mind has been to no avail. I sure hope someone who is knowledgeable enough could present accounts from the Buddha and/or other masters to help me with this matter. Much appreciated.

The Venerable Master Hsuan-Hua comments:
Question: "When you eat one bowl of rice, you take the life of all the grains of rice, whereas eating meat you take only one animal's life.
The Master: On the body of one single animal are a hundred thousand, in fact, sever million little organisms. These organisms are fragments of what was once an animal. The soul of a human being at death may split up to become many animals. One person can become about ten animals. That's why animals are so stupid. The soul of an animal can split up and become, in its smallest division, an organism or plant. The feelings which plants have, then, are what separated from the animals's soul when it split up at death. Although the life force of a large number of plants may appear sizeable, it is not as great as that of a single animal or a single mouthful of meat. Take, for example, rice: tens of billions of grains of rice do not contain as much life force as a single piece of meat. If you open your Five Eyes you can know this at a glance. If you haven't opened your eyes, no matter how one tries to explain it to you, you won't understand. No matter how it's explained, you won't believe it, because you haven't been a plant!
"Another example is the mosquitoes. The millions of mosquitoes on this mountain may be simply the soul of one person who has been transformed into all those bugs. It is not the case that a single human soul turns into a single mosquito. One person can turn into countless numbers of mosquitos.

"At death the nature changes, the soul scatters, and its smallest fragments become plants. Thus, there is a difference between eating plants and eating animals. What is more, plants have very short lifespans. The grass, for example, is born in the spring and dies within months. Animals live a long time. If you don't kill them, they will live for many years. Rice, regardless of conditions, will only live a short time. And so, if you really look into it, there are many factors to consider, and even science hasn't got it all straight."

Malcolm wrote:
Actually, they didn't, it was railroads. The gun culture in this country was largely a post-Civil War phenomena created by mail order catalogues such as Sears and Roebucks who helped Smith and Wesson, etc., maintain their wartime production quotas after the war by selling cheap mass produced guns into the civilian market. Prior to the Civil War, most guns were very expensive, handmade items. In 1835, however, Colt began to mass produce revolvers, etc.

The mass production of guns for the civilian market however ramped up under Winchester in 1873, with the repeating rifle.

Combined with penny novels, these catalogues romanticized gun ownership, and along with low prices, guns began to become a very predominant force in American society, in the South and West in particular. Here in the Northeast, we generally have a more civilized attitude towards guns, and for example, this kind of incident could never happen in Massachusetts because assault weapons are banned in this state, and second, all guns that one owns must be registered, and third there are laws about how they are stored and how they can be moved.

However, we clearly need a national gun control law in this country, the Second Amendment does not prohibit gun control laws and never has.

His opinion is that modern Bon, so called Yungdrung Bon, is structured on the basis of Buddhism and is for the most part wholly derivative of Buddhism, apart from obviously autochthonic concepts and practice such as Sang, Lungta, etc. We can see this in Ye khrid mtha' sel, for example, which presents a Bon version of Naro Khachodma complete with a version of the triple OM mantra.

Even if we don't accept that the evidence for the text being Kuiji's is conclusive, the fact that it is a translation from Chinese, and that even if it isn't a chinese text originally, Sinhalese doesn't necessarily equal Indian.

Malcolm wrote:
The colophon of the Tibetan is pretty clear, the commentary was written by a Sinhalese ācārya named Prthivibandhu, but this does not a) bar him from having written the commentary in China, b) does not bar him from having been a student of Xuanzang, and c) does not bar him from being privy to debates about Mahāyāna sūtras and their Indian interpretation because a) being Sinhalese does not bar one from traveling to India or China and b) does not bar one from having a Chinese Buddhist teacher.

Further, the fact that Tibetan text is shorter than its Chinese sister could very well mean that the Chinese commentary was amended with further chapters after the text was translated into Tibetan, either from Sanskrti or Chinese. There is no indication in the Tibetan colophon of the Dege edition as to whether it was translated from Sanskrit or Chinese.

Not the pratityasamutpāda of the Buddha. The Buddha taught dependent origination in three ways: serial (multiple lives), momentary, and simultaneous. All three are complementary, and none may be excluded from one's understanding of the Buddha's teaching.

I think there is much more to delusion that what you describe, Malcolm. How we apprehend the meaning of Dharma, relate it to ourselves, others, grasp on to our understanding as something to possess and fetishise, delusion permeates every aspect of our being. The very way we perceive is imbued with the burdens and obscurations of delusions, so of course any "view" will be tainted. And it cannot, in and of itself, cure anything, it can only help guide us towards insight and release. So at a given time, mistaken views about rebirth may be the least of one's problem.

Malcolm wrote:
You do not distinguish the distinction between the relative and relative truth. When we begin to study Dharma, we first study relative truth, learning to distinguish what to reject and what to accept. For example, we learn to reject the ten nonvirtues, and adopt the ten virtues; we learn to accept a true refuge and reject a false refuge. We learn to accept the authority of āryas and reject the authority of worldlings where they contradict the words of āryas. We learn that we are not undertaking the practice of Dharma solely for our own benefit, but to becomes buddhas to benefit all sentient beings. Any person who chooses virtue, a true refuge, accepts the words of the Buddha, and is motivated to attain buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings cannot be called deluded, even if they are mistaken about this thing and that.

Right view cannot be tainted, because then it would not longer be right view. There is a mundane right view which is the way an ordinary person sees the four truths: suffering, the cause, cessation, and the path. But there is nothing tainted about maintaining mundane right view. In fact, right view is a path dharma, and among conditioned entities, only path dharmas are uncontaminated. So there is no chance one who has right view has a contaminated view.

Indeed, as Nāgārjuna points out it is by relying on conventional truth that one understands the ultimate. So your portrayal of the hopeless confusion of the common person applies only to those who have not entered the door of Dharma. That door is only entered by seeking refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

Yeah sure, but what is really meant by "conceives of right view"? What is to "possess the Dharma"? I don't know. To me it seems that a deluded wordling is by definition incapable of "conceiving of right view". In his or her mind, even the words of the Buddha will be chopped down to his own size, beaten into his conceptual framework and twisted by his clinging and aversion. Aye, there's the rub...

Malcolm wrote:
There are two kinds of right view: mundane and supermundane.

You are overextending the notion of "deluded" to mean incapacitated.

When we use the term "deluded," we simply mean that someone is mistaken about whether or not there is a self that can be found, which is either the same as or different from the aggregates, or that someone is mistaken about the consequences of their actions, or os mistaken about what is a real source of refuge. It does not mean that such a person cannot distinguish between cars and chairs.

Mundane right view cures mistaken notions about the self, mistaken notions about causes and effects, as well as mistaken notions about sources of refuge.

It is possible to be an ordinary, unawakened person, and also be undeluded in a conventional sense. This is what the two paths below the path of seeing entail. These two paths are the path of accumulation and the path of application. People who have taken the bodhisattva vow, and are applying themselves to understanding emptiness are not deluded in a conventional sense even if they have not "seen the truth" one sees on the path of seeing.

Basically, when one rejects rebirth (which is a rejection of cause and effect), when one is mistaken about the sources of refuge, or when one is mistaken about the existence of the self, then we can say one is deluded.

There is no Buddhadharma without rebirth in samsara as its context. Buddhadharma is specifically a solution to the existential problem of rebirth, and therefore, samsara. If one removes the doctrine of karma and rebirth, one removes the very reason for Buddhadharma's existence. People who do not accept rebirth and karma are not interested in Dharma.

What Batchelor does is try to force some so called "early Buddhist text" into a tortured reading in order to justify his denatured "Buddhism." But as we known, "Buddhism" is one thing, and Buddhadharma, quite another.

With respect to right view, it applies to all followers of Buddhadharma, even if they might be a little confused about Vajrayāna practices such as pure perception. Right view is fundamental to Buddhadharma and all liberation proceeds from cultivating right view and eschewing wrong view.

In Japanese Buddhism especially, it is not unusual to find persons who describe themselves as "upholders of the Lotus Sutra" or similar.  In contrast, from the perspective of classical Indian Mahayana, would the meaning of an "upholder" of this sutra differ significantly?  Specifically, if the Lotus Sutra is seen as part of a continuous canon of teachings and not as a singular event, then what could it mean to "uphold" the sutra?

Malcolm wrote:
All claims have a context. No substantial evidence has ever been put forward suggest Indians formed schools around individual sūtras, suggesting that the context of such claims found in Saddhamrmapundarika Sūtra are extremely different in India than they grew to be in China and later, Japan.

The Ghanavyūha buddhafield exists beyond the subtle particle nature of the other buddhafields. The Ghanavyūha buddhafield is without the sun, planets, and the moon. Because it’s nature is unconditioned, it does not appear as the most subtle of subtle particles.
Thus the Buddha teaches that all buddhas attain buddhahood in Ghanavyūha.

And, it is really not a place within time or space:
When consciousness transforms,
it is Ghanavyūha free from mind. 
It is not the domain of those with concepts.
The palace of the Tathāgata, Ghanavyūha,

For the sambhogakāya, the place is always Akaniṣṭha, the teacher is always the sambhogakāya of the Buddha, the retinue is always not-retrogressing bodhisattvas as well as buddha-emanations, the teaching is always Mahāyāna, or Ekayāna, whichever term you like, and the time is always.

Further you claim:

The trikaya teaching appeared after the Lotus appeared. To the extent that later Lotus proponents labored to find the trikaya in the Lotus, its because they were resolving distinctions that came up later and were then used to analyze the sutras. We use more words to resolve the breaches that words created in the first place.

Malcolm wrote:
This apparently means you do not accept the teachings of the three kāyas as the Buddha's teaching. Why? It appears in many sūtras. This is why I chided you for relying on text critical scholarship when it suits you, and ignoring it when it doesn't.

The Buddha is quite clearly stating that Rajagriha is a sambhogakāya buddhafield since it will not perish when the Sahaloka perishes. He states he will always be present there. He states the Dharma he will teach there, etc. He states that its continuous presence cannot be observed by everyone. It is really quite clear.

Malcolm wrote:
In Dzogchen, the tathāgatagarbha is not the ālayavijñāna. The ālayavijñāna is a product of the delusion of the imputing ignorance. Tathāgatagarbha is the gzhi. When it is recognized, there is nirvana, when it is not recognized, there is samsara. Tathāgatagarbha does not prevent delusion nor does it stimulate awakening.


Grigoris said:
If the Tathagatagarbha is not the basis of liberation, then what is?  Are you implying that not all sentient beings possess Tathagatagarbha?  Only Buddhists?  Only Buddhists have the ever-present potential for enlightenment?

Malcolm wrote:
The basis of liberation is right view. We have covered this already. The rest of your questions are inapplicable.


Grigoris said:
Well, all I can say then is you seem not to understand the difference between following the Vajrayāna path and the common sūtra path.
I didn't know they were separate, I thought they were complimentary.

Malcolm wrote:
They have the same goal. But the common sūtra path is for those of less capacity and intelligence who imagine it is necessary to practice in a very external way to gather the two accumulations. The Vajrayāna path is for those who are intelligent and highly motivated to attain buddhahood.


Grigoris said:
Is there a sentient being out there that will not achieve Buddhahood?


Malcolm wrote:
Madhyamaka categorically rejects the Yogacara doctrine of icchantikas, still they admit that there are some sentient beings who may never attain buddhahood.

Hi everyone,

Are Tibetan monks vegetarian? If not, any meats they are not allowed to eat, or they are allowed to any meats?

No. The standard meats classes (humans, carnivores) that Buddha forbad monks apply.

What do you mean by 'text based logic'?...

I do have a bias in favor of the sutra. If that is 'text based logic', then that is an accurate characterization.

Malcolm wrote:
Your hermeneutical criteria has been overdetermined by Western text critical scholarship.

Can you imagine any traditional scholar arguing about the five certainties in the Saddharmapundarika Sūtra based on some idea that it was written down between 100 BCE —— 100 CE? I can't.

The Buddha's parinivana dates to roughly around 407 BCE if you follow the dates put forward by Cousins, etc, much earlier if you follow more traditional dates. Yet you claim that Lotus itself dates to a period 300——500 years later. So, is it 1) the Buddha's teaching or 2) merely the work of an inspired Mahāyani, or 3) do you accept the tradition that the Mahāyāna sūtras were kept hidden for hundreds of years by bodhisattvas and slowly revealed?

Queequeg said:
I quote the Buddha's words from the sutra without caveat. It is the Buddha's teaching. How it came to be written, some time in the 1st c. BCE ~ 1st c. CE, I have no idea.

Malcolm wrote:
It's good that you have no idea. You also have no idea when it was committed to writing. So why waste your time assuming that things like the five certainties are "younger" than the Saddharmapundarika Sūtra? If we follow your text based logic, also the sambhogakāya is "younger" than the Saddharmapundarika Sūtra.

But basically, yeah. Indications of Buddha Nature are expressed in normal life too, although in immature, incomplete, stunted ways--at least as per the Vajra Master of Sherab Ling Monastery.
