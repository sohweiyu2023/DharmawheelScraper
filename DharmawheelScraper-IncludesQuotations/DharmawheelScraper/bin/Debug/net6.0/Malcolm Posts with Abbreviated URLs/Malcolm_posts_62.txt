That's simply the argument given across 81 pages: that every scholar and most western practitioners uncritically accept the hegemonic view that the Mahayana sutras were later developments. In other words, when anyone reads sutras, they read them in that way.

Malcom's argument is that we need to overturn this hegemony.

The fact that there is a hegemony to be overturned clearly implies that we ought not take things at face value; we ought to find some other (more traditional) way of engaging.

Malcolm wrote:
Tobes, quit playing with words.

Otherwise, you are quite right, there is a lens through which every one introduced to Buddhism in the West reads Buddhism and that lens was originally polished in the late 19th century.

That lens consists primarily of the assumption that writing was unknown in India at the time of the Buddha and that all references to writing are proofs of post-Hellenic developments.

They all adhere to the text critical method which is the consensus view of Buddhist textual evolution in the academy.

For example, our own dear and beloved Huifeng doesn't believe a single word of Mahāyāna was taught by the Buddha. Neither does Jeff aka Indrajala, and I dare say, neither do you. Forget about all these fancy rationals, dreams, visions, and so on. Basically, the simple fact is that most of us who follow Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna don't actually believe that the scriptures we purport to follow were indeed taught by the Buddha in any form at all.

On two occasions, I've been able to to see mid-19th century photographs of Tibetan Buddhist practitioners and some of their implements (one was on display years ago at the University of New Mexico, USA; the other at George Mason University, USA).  It seems to me that there have been some small but significant changes in the size and shape of some articles of practice, which seem to be increasingly standardized today.  For instance, the chodpas I've seen photographed in practice over a hundred years ago might have much smaller and differently-accoutred damaru than one might expect to see someone using today--or not.

I'm wondering if these changes reflect easier manufacturing processes today compared to pre-industrial Asia, or changes in attitude/expectation toward practice implements, or something else entirely--or if I'm completely off the reservation in my reading of these images.

Thanks.

Malcolm wrote:
It is not likely to happen. I have been reading academic Buddhist literature for the better part of three decades, I worked for a Buddhist book store at one time, and also Wisdom Pubs as their retail manager in 1990-1. I have maintained a familiarity with the latest and greatest of academic literature especially where it concerns Mahāyāna — when I tell you that it piles speculation on assumptions in absence of actual facts, I mean it. When I tell you that I have observed a number of interpretive fads amongst western scholars, I mean it. Even if there are closeted Buddhists in academia, they certainly cannot write books from the perspective of their faith. Instead, they must accommodate the western scholastic set of assumptions and prejudices about the history of Mahāyāna whether they buy them or not (but they largely seem to). The one thing it all boils down to is that according to the current state of knowledge of the origins of Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna, western scholars simply have no clear idea where these traditions are from and how they arose.

But we do. Why? Because we have clear accounts of the rise of these teachings; which teacher brought out which tantras (Nairatma, Hevajra; Saraha, Cakrasamvara, Garab Dorje, the Dzogchen Tantras, and so on). In general we consider that Nāgārjuna revealed Mahāyāna. And that is all a practitioner of these systems really needs to know.

Their approach does not lead to a living wisdom tradition that will never be obsolete. Their approach leads to dead knowledge in a book, soon obsolete.

He told me then he was glad he was a Christian, because Buddhism as a religion to follow never made any sense to him, despite is his interest in Madhyamaka.

Pretty much every suggestion of origin, or attempt to pin something down in Buddhist history is met with a chorus of confusion and counter claims.

I seriously considered becoming a Buddhologist, but after seeing how the work of people like Janet Gyatso, Hallisey, Van de Kuip, Germano, etc., turned out, and how destructive, or if you prefer, deconstructive the approach of the western academy towards Buddhadharma is, I have decided to eschew its conclusions as non-productive and sterile speculations.

You basically do not have any faith in the tradition, which is fine — but then you are left holding a bunch of teachings in which you have no confidence nor reason to believe that they will do anything other than provide you with a few hours of entertainment. Otherwise, if you actually have confidence in the teachings, you cannot really say why you do apart from your own conceptual admiration of them since you certainly cannot believe they come from an awakened source. This is the inevitable consequence of accepting the text critical version of the history of Buddhist sūtras and tantras.

And in doing so opening up a new position which seemingly holds that there are two types of concepts/language - one in which the intractable gap is generated, and the other in which language/concepts is reality.

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddhāvatamska states:

From one single melodious word of the victors,
all the infinite gates of Dharma arise.

And:

The tathāgatas fully attain the accomplishment of speech that is without center or periphery in order that all realms of sentient beings may understand it with a single tone

The gap between reality and language is a problem only for us. There is no such gap for Buddhas? Why? Because the Buddhas are free from concepts. So their acts of speech are similarly free from any conceptual restraint that would differentiate their content from describing reality just as it is.

To answer Dante's question about whether the Buddha taught the PP in 100,000 lines, one day, 25 on a different day and so on -- it is not necessary to think this way.

From rigpawiki.org

According to this definiton by Mipham Rinpoche Carvaka are tirthika: The tirthikas' views embody the gross, simplistic view of eternalism, considering that phenomena are not momentary and the simplistic view of nihilism, the belief that although phenomena are caused, they themselves do not generate their own effects—there are no past nor future lives—or that actions will not give rise to karmic results.

So either the translation is incorrect, or Mipham is mistaken.

Guru Rinpoche lists four types of non- buddhists phyal ba, rgyang 'phen pa (carvaka), mur thug pa, and mu stegs pa. The last, used for eternalists, is well known to translate the term "tīrthika" i.e. forders of the crossing, referring to their belief in rebirth.

But the Lotus Sutra of this world would certainly be taught by a different Buddhua, at a different, time, place and retinue. And since you said that the conditions does not have to be same, etc, then it is quite clear that the Hevajra in this world was taught after the 4 tenet schools have arisen, since that would be the appropriate condition for the tantra to actually mention the 4 schools. Hence we have internal evidence that the Hevajra was really taught later, via visions, illusory bodies, etc.p[./quote]

This is not evidence for that. One, it was taught to Virupa by a human women in person, the Nirmanakāya Nairatmya, not in a dream. Secondly, it was taught by the Buddha in the morning of his awakening when he conquered the four māras. Further, the longest version of it was taught eons ago by Mahāvajradhara.

Since Buddhas are indeed omniscient concerning the three times, there is also no contradiction that the Buddha could teach on the four tenets before they arose. And since the retinue the Buddha taught the Hevajra too on the morning of his awakening is not specified apart from Vajragarbha and the net of dākinīs, we can also assume they understood what the Buddha was teaching about in the two sectioned version of the Hevajra tantra.

So there is no contradiction at all in the same sūtra or tantra being taught in a different manner, with different topics when taught to different people in different epochs.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course - proof that sutras don't have to be taught by the nirmanakaya Buddha, can be taught later, etc.
When a sūtra or tantra is taught to an ordinary human being, it needs to be taught by a Nirmanakāya, as we see from account of Virupa's awakening. Virupa was not yet even a first stage bodhisattva when he met Nairatmya, so he could not possibly have perceived her in any other form than the one she presents to him as a two armed, one faced human being.


Unknown said:
I am not saying that such persons reject the sutras and tantras are taught by the Buddha. Let me repeat myself again, since you are obviously deaf to this: the sutras and tantras are indeed taught by the Buddha, but the Buddha is not limited to his nirmanakaya form 2500 years ago in India.

Malcolm wrote:
Sure, but when a sutra says "When the Buddha was residing in Vaisali attended by Śariputra, etc." we are to understand it happened within the 80 year span of the Buddha and not in some vision.

Because of his all-pervasiveness and supreme skillfulness, he can manifest in the mindstream of sentient beings teaching in various forms and methods, even after his rupakaya entered parinirvana. In this, I would say that my position on this is stronger than yours, since I am not constrained by historical facts.

Malcolm wrote:
But you are so constrained by the historical references to various places and events mentioned in many Mahāyāna sutras. I am specifically referring to sūtras that say things like "When the Bhagavan was residing at Vulture Peak or Vaisali, etc."

The second thing constraining you is that there is no Indian tradition at all which suggests what you suggest, i.e. that Mahāyāna sutras were produced piecemeal in visions by later yogins. This is just a modern rational invented by you latter-day Mahāyānists who have basically accepted the idea that Mahāyāna was not actually taught by the nirmanakāya Śakyamuni Buddha. Why do you use this rational? It is because you fundamentally accept the account of the appearance of Mahāyāna as it is presented by western scholars from the time of Max Müller onward.

Two points about this. 1. There's basically universal agreement that in any Buddhist tradition, language does not objectively reflect or refer to reality. Thus the problematic of language games runs deep through Buddhism, and often becomes a very central and prominent soteriological/philosophical issue. Surely you would not dispute this.
If this were really true, then how do you deal with acts of true speech? For example, in the Śatasāhasrikāprajñāpāramitābṛhaṭṭīkā we find:

"When an irreversible bodhisattva sees a city on fire, he says "May the fire be pacified". When the fire is pacified through the blessings of true words, you can know that one as being irreversible."

The only way to get outside of this is to either cease using language (which I suggested, and in some respects is a plausible yogic response) or to run with some alternative theory of language/meaning ala Panini, which would be very antithetical to any orthodox Buddhist view.

I think that thus far Western analysis of classical Buddhist attitudes towards language have ignored the role of satya-vacana.

He does. In the Yogini's Eye, he says: Some scholars say that the Mahayana Sutras were compiled in the southern region called Vimalasambhava in a gathering of 900 million bodhisattvas. However, this is in great error as [this gathering] never took place.

Malcolm wrote:
No, Verril has translated this passage incorrectly. I give the correct translation above, which is confirmed in another one of his works, which I also produced. "Yogini's Eye" is Verril's title for the General Presentation of The Divisions of Tantra. The passage is "...de'ang skyon chen po ni med do", "also a great error that is not", the error is asserting 90 million, rather than one. Here is my rendering again:

"When some masters say that the Mahāyāna sūtras were compiled after ninety million bodhisattvas gathered in the southern direction at Vimalasambhāva although there is no great fault in that position,

Further proof of my reading is that Sakya Pandita, Sonam Tsemo's nephew states in his Great History of Dharma:
"It is reputed that "One million bodhisattvas gathered at the southern royal palace, Vimalasambhava, where Mañjuśī compiled the sūtras, Vajrapani compiled Abhidharma, and Ajita Maitreya compiled the Vinaya in the language of Mahāyāna."

He then describes how statments in the sutras which describe both Vajrapani and Ānanda as the compiler of the teachings are not in contradiction. Later Buton, Rinchen Drup gives this account, then Kongtrul.

If Sapan thought it completely wrong, he would have rejected it outright — as we have plenty of examples of his doing so. Sonam Tsemo presents it in two different works which I produce above. The point is that this account is generally an accepted in Tibet from an early period.

I have since decided the whole approach to Dharma represented in that post written six months ago, opinions held for many years, since the early 90's, were frankly held up on baseless suppositions derived from my early Buddhist studies.

One cannot maintain that the sūtras are "satya-vacana", truthful speech, while maintaining that their origins are lies.

These present statements function to remedy in some small way my past error.

Further, there is no contradiction at all, since when this tantra was revealed to Mahasiddha Virupa by the nirmanakāya ḍākinī, Nairatmya, it was in a time and a place where the four tenet systems had arisen.

pueraeternus said:
Oh, so Nairatmya would alter the contents of the tantra to suit Virupa's understanding? This would make the whole origin stories irrelevant and unnecessary.

Malcolm wrote:
No, it does not make the origin stories irrelevant nor unnecessary. For example, when the Saddharmapundarika sutra was taught, the Buddha states that it was taught in the very distant past by a Buddha called Candrasūryapradīpa. But I don't think we need to assume that the words are identical in every respect, nor was the assembly the same, nor were the conditions the same, and so on. He adds:

Immeasurable buddhas in the present and future
Will also teach this Dharma
With various skillful means.

Indicating that the Saddharmapundarika sutra will be taught in the future by many Buddhas.

So there is no contradiction at all in the same sūtra or tantra being taught in a different manner, with different topics when taught to different people in different epochs.

For example, the main point of the Hevajra tantra is that it presents the method of realizing the continuum of Vajradhara in the form of Hevajra, not that it mentions the four tenet systems, as well as the four divisions of tantra.

"the single vajra word is heard differently by beings of different capacities".

The meaning of the words can mean differently or have deeper layers to those of greater capacity, but the words would still be the same.
No, actually, that is the point. When citation this is taken from explains that one words is heard as different words by different people. It is called the "array of speech".


Many have advanced in their practice of tantra, even when they disagree with the varying origin stories of this sutra or that tantra.
Like who? Can you name even one modern person who has "advanced in their practice" even though they reject the sutras and tantras were actually taught by the Buddha?

Tradition claims that Shakyamuni taught Hevajra during his earthly time (to subdue the four maras), but in the subjugating chapter, he said that one should study the Vaibhasika, then Sautrantika, then Yogacara and then Madhyamaka. These schools didn't exist at all 2500 years ago, and would have made absolutely no sense to who ever was taught the tantra back then. This is just an example of the many anarchronisms that are all over the place, especially in the later Mahayana tracts.

Malcolm wrote:
The source of this idea comes from the Śrī-vajramālābhidhānamahāyogatantra-sarvatantrahṛdaya-rahasyavibhaṅga by Paṇḍita Alaṃkakalaśa. After listing the various deva realms and so on where each of the five classes of tantra were taught he states:

After that, for the purpose of subduing the four māras, the large great tantra of Śrī Hevajra and explanatory tantra of the short one were taught here in Magadha in this Jambudvipa.

This does not mean it was taught to an ordinary assembly, as we can see, since the this pandita clearly states the compilers of the tantras are either Vajrapani or Mañjuśri, and because the petitioner of the Hevajra is Vajragarbha, a tenth stage bodhisattva. At the time of the taming of the four Māras, there was no ordinary Sangha at all.

Further, there is no contradiction at all, since when this tantra was revealed to Mahasiddha Virupa by the nirmanakāya ḍākinī, Nairatmya, it was in a time and a place where the four tenet systems had arisen. It is not the case that sūtras and tantras are engraved on golden plates somewhere and that their words are somehow eternal. As has been pointed out to you already, "the single vajra word is heard differently by beings of different capacities".

Tantras like Cakrasamvara were never taught to a bhikṣu sangha nor by Śakyamuni, but only in the 24 places, where they are still taught by the Nirmanakāya in the form of Cakrasamvara, just as Guru Rinpoche, Śakyamuni's emanation, is still teaching the rakṣasas in Camara on Zangdog Palri.

Khepa: We are American Tantric Buddhists. We are not Tibetan Tantric Buddhists. So there was a long period where I decided I did not want any contact with any other teachings. I wanted to teach purely what was given to me through Terma and through vision. Now it‟s been eight years, and our community is very well established.

One prong is that it's faddish and speculative.
The second prong is that it's harmful to a practitioner's conviction.

You've also made it clear that it's this second concern which is the primary motivation for your new stance against scholarship. You used to find the scholarship worthy of consideration, and you even agreed with some of its findings, but now you reject it because you saw it has a pernicious undermining effect on belief in the validity of the Mahayana dharma.

So I am wondering what your response would be if somebody presented scholarship that was not speculative, but nevertheless weakened your conviction. Would you still reject it on those grounds? Or would you change your beliefs, for instance by abandoning Mahayana in favor of the sravaka path?

And along the same lines, if there are practitioners here who do not think the historical Buddha taught what is in the Mahayana sutras, would you advise them to become sravakas?

Malcolm wrote:

And the traces that it has created are very strong, and present obstacles to many people's practice.

The only honest thing they can say is this: X text appears in Chinese here, here and here; and in Tibetan here; and in some Central Asian fragments we think date to here. And that is all, nothing more.

Those are the empirical facts, the only "truth" they can muster.

I understand the fascination with mysteries and puzzles, but in reality, there is almost nothing of use in western historical Buddhist writing that is of any benefit to practicing Mahāyāna Buddhists.

For example, when you have such a mess of theories, where is the "valid" knowledge therein contained.

Schopen's work, for example, is interesting because he chooses to focus on material evidence of Buddhism in India. Fine, but when he starts speculating, as he does throughout his books, and saying things like "the Buddha is made to predict..." and so on, we have left the grounds of confirmed evidence and entered the realm of hypothesizing.

My point is that Buddhists are not going to learn more about Buddhism by reading the speculative fantasies by which Buddhologists and Tibetologists earn their meager salaries. They are merely going to fill their head with the prapañca of conflicting theories and intellectual fashions.

If one criticizes Mahāyāna as being a late production, inevitably one will be lead down the path of destroying the Dharma in general. One can't start at Mahāyāna, then stop at Abhidhamma. One can't start at Abhidhamma, but stop at the Dīgha Nikāya and so on. In the end, since the focus of text criticism is strictly forensic, once the autopsy is over, there is very little left of a corpse to bury.

In short, Buddhology is of no use to practitioners at all. It does not provide us with a solid sense of history; it does the opposite; it does not provide us with tradition, it does the opposite; it is not grounded in wisdom, but rather the rank conceptuality of ordinary people who are for the most part NOT practitioners and have no interest in transforming their lives with the Dharma. Further, I have seen more than one former practitioner travel down the road of Buddhology/Tibetology, etc., and completely lose their faith and interest in practice altogether. Why? Because they begin to prioritize what they learn in the academy over what they have learned from their gurus, and their spiritual development comes to a grinding halt.

Here is a beautiful example of just what a useless waste of time Western writing on Buddhist history can become:

The uncertainty around this school has fuelled a number of hypotheses. Frauwallner’s theory is that the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya was the disciplinary code of an early Buddhist community based in Mathura, which was quite independent as a monastic community from the Sarvāstivādins of Kaśmir (although of course this does not mean that they were different in terms of doctrine). Lamotte, against Frauwallner, asserts that the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya was a late Kaśmīr compilation made to complete the Sarvāstivādin Vinaya.2 Warder suggests that the Mūlasarvāstivādins were a later development of the Sarvāstivāda, whose main innovations were literary, the compilation of the large Vinaya and the Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna Sūtra,3 which kept the early doctrines but brought the style up to date with contemporary literary tastes.4 Enomoto pulls the rug out from all these theories by asserting that Sarvāstivādin and Mūlasarvāstivādin are really the same. Meanwhile, Willemen, Dessein, and Cox have developed the theory that the Sautrantikas, a branch or tendency within the Sarvāstivādin group of schools, emerged in Gandhāra and Bactria around 200 ce. Although they were the earlier group, they temporarily lost ground to the Kaśmīr Vaibhāśika school due to the political influence of Kaṇiṣka. In later years the Sautrantikas became known as the Mūlasarvāstivādins and regained their earlier ascendancy.5 I have elsewhere given my reasons for disagreeing with the theories of Enomoto and Willemen et al.6 Neither Warder nor Lamotte give enough evidence to back up their theories.
[Sects & Sectarianism, Sujato]

Don't get me wrong here, of course this book is well written and has a lot of interesting information, but passages like the above clearly illustrate the absurdity of much of what has been written by "Buddhologists".

pueraeternus said:
Oh yes - these contradictions are especially problematic if you think that the nirmanakaya Buddha said all of these contradictory things during his lifetime. It makes a lot more sense to consider that the late tantras were revealed much later when the socio-political ground has changed so much that new teachings needed to be given to suit the times, excessive brahmanical-influenced obsession on purity needed to be countered by antinomian praxis, etc. And this can be resolved by not editing any sutra or tantra, but by merely not forcefully locking them into a specific time of origin that makes no sense whatsoever.

Malcolm wrote:
The sutras and tantras themselves indicate when they were taught and where. In general, the tantras are not the Nirmanakāya's teachings at all.

produces and increases all qualities,
removes fears and crosses rivers;
faith shows the way to the city of bliss…
But I would say that it is the my faith in the Buddha's teaching, even where I did not fully understand it, that allowed me to grow in my understanding of the Dharma.

So yes, sometimes I say I don't need faith, that means "blind faith".

But lack of faith is damaging to one's practice, since faith is defined as "clarity about an object". Lack of clarity about the teachings, lack of clarity about one's practice, all of this comes about from the "lack of clarity" we term "lack of faith".

All non-virtuous actions come from afflictions. I understood that by maintaining the view that Mahāyāna sutras were products of later authors, not the Buddha, there was no way to avoid the contamination of subtle traces of lack of faith in the Buddha's teachings. These subtle traces cause obstacles in one's practice and life. Of course, if one is not a Mahāyāni, then there is no problem. But if one has taken bodhisattva vows, and so on, lack of complete confidence in the origin of Mahāyāna sutras is destructive to those vows.

There is no doubt that the three turnings are as the Samdhinirmocana sutra states, as it specifies 3 different times, each vehicle higher than the previous. The sites of the first 2 turnings are common knowledge. The third one not sure, but certainly timewise, it is later than the 2nd turning. This is crystal clear from the sutra.

Malcolm wrote:

No, it is very clearly stated in the commentarial literature what "simultaneous" means, it means that when he was in Śravasti, he taught both Śravakayāna and Mahāyāna, when he was Kapilavastu, he taught both, and so on.

And the fact that the 3rd wheel was turned because the 2nd wheel suffered "controversy", is another fact that shows that the 3rd was turned later than the 2nd.

Malcolm wrote:
No, this is not a warranted conclusion. In order to establish this, you would have be to able to say for certain whether this sūtra was taught after the Prajñāpāramita, but as there is absolutely no difference in the statement of the text concerning the content of the second and third turning, your contention cannot be verified at all.

For example, in the 25,000 PP, the Buddha replies to Subhuti's declaration that the Buddha had turned a second wheel of Dharma:
Subhuti, because of the essential non-existence of things, this is also not a second turning of the wheel, it is also not the first turning of the wheel.

pueraeternus said:
A bunch of arhats preserved the Sravaka canon much better, maintaining the transmission immediately after the parinirvana.

Malcolm wrote:
As did Āryabodhisattvas. All these questions have been previously addressed. Further, the Buddha predicted obstacles for Mahāyāna in the 25,000 and elsewhere: "Subhuti, many obstacles will arise for this Prajñāpāramita..." and so on.

pueraeternus said:
Contrast this with bodhisattvas, who are supposed to be vastly superior in every way, having the Mahayana canon in such piecemeal fashion and all over the place?

Malcolm wrote:
The Tarkajvala states:

Not long after the Bhagavan's parinirvana, the śravakas were totally attached to the teaching for themselves.

In fact, the whole "three turnings" thing is so unimportant to Indians, there is no a single Indian commentarial voice on the issue. There exists solely a Korean commentary and a Tibetan commentary in the bstan 'gyur that deals with the issue at all. As we have seen, the Korean commentary attempts to define a temporal sequence, the Tibetan commentary does not make any such attempt.

On the other hand, there are many voices which deal with Maitreya Bodhisattvas statement that Śrāvakayāna and Mahāyāna arose together.

I do not say that text criticism was immoral, what I said was that if one accepts the text critical version of Buddhist history and one is a Mahāyāni, then one necessarily accepts that the texts one is following are not authentic. That is an immoral position for a Mahāyānist to take.

This is obviously a problem for Indian Mahāyānists because they again and again voice the sentiment that Mahāyāna sūtras need to be accepted as historical Buddhavacana, i.e. that they come from the time with the Buddha had not passed into parinirvana.

I think it is simply more practical for practicing Mahāyānis to accept the classical Indian Mahāyāna position about the authorship of the sūtras. We then avoid all the complications of later and earlier sutras, blah, blah, blah.

pueraeternus said:
Maitreya can't have meant that the 2 vehicles was taught at the same time, because in the Samdhinirnocana, it is explicitly mentioned that the dharma wheel was turned 3 separate times - first at Benares the four noble truths, then the Buddha later turned it a second time proclaiming alaksanadharmacakra (Madhyamaka) for the Bodhisattvas, then finally because even the second turning was provisional, he turned the wheel the third time for the ultimate teaching (Yogacara). So you see, even the Buddha himself segregated the 3 sets of teachings into 3 distinct temporal periods.

Malcolm wrote:
While it is certainly true that many people have understood it this way, for example, the Korean master Wan tshig (sorry, did not dig up his actual Korean name): Indeed that Dharma of the Buddha is profound, nevertheless because there are many methods of guidance and ways of introducing it, not only one, the Sovereign of the Dharma taught three Dharma wheels. Among those the first the demonstration of cycling in the forests where wild animals roam who constantly perish and the causes and results of nirvana to those who are to enter into the Śrāvakayāna. This is called “The Dharmawheel of the four truths”. Second, is teaching the Ārya-prajñāpāramita to sixteen gatherings at Vulture Peak and so on to those who are to enter the Bodhisattvayāna. This is called the Dharmawheel of characteristiclessness. The third is the teaching of the Saṃdhinirmocana and so on to those in the pure buddhafields such as Padmagarbha, and the impure ones to those are to enter all vehicles called the “Mahāyāna of the definitive meaning”.
This is not completely certain. There is no record in any other sutra or commentary of where these sites may be. In any case, even if we accept Wan tshig's statement at face value, it still means that the Mahāyāna arose at the same time as the Śravakayāna because it was taught during the lifetime of the Buddha.

Moreover, there is no certain statement in the citation itself that this is the case. In his General Division of Tantras, Loppon Sonam Tsemo responds to the above assertion:
If it is true those three Dharmawheels were turned for different inclinations, to claim “…they were turned in stages in different countries’” is not reasonable. If it is asked how it is not reasonable, it is because scripture and reason are contradicted, the objections of the srāvakas will not be rejected, the Sugata will come under criticism and so on. Because there will be many such faults, it is not reasonable.
He ultimately answers this qualm with the citation from the Sutralaṃkara:
Not predicted earlier, arising at the same time.

As the Sandhivyākarana-tantra too states:

Non-conceptual, undisturbed,
...the pleasing single vajra word
becomes many different [words]
from the perspective of the mentalities of the trainees.

A single statement of the Bhagavan’s will appear as many different Dharmas to many different trainees at the same time. That also does not contradict the citation of the Samdhinirmocana-sūtra explained above. Although that citation does state different Dharmas, it does not state different locations or different times. Since that is so, teaching different Dharmas to trainees with one statement made at the same time is called “the array of speech,” and demonstrating many different bodies in different locations at the same time are the beneficial deeds with an array of bodies.

Since logically if the these turnings were done during the Buddha's earthly time, then we would have seen the movements started during his lifetime.

Hello All,

Question about group practice:

If a number people were planning to get together and do chNNr's Green Tara practice and everyone but two people had received introductory transmission and the Green Tara lung from chNNr, but had done Tara pracices before from other teachers would it be okay for them to participate in a group practice setting and do chNNr's  Green Tara practice?

Both of these folks are intending on receiving transmission from chNNr eventually. I don't want to discourage them from coming to an event, but although it is a peaceful practice (obviously no action mantras during this gathering) It requires a lung so I am not sure what to do other than do another Tara practice that everyone has authorization for.

Thanks in advance for any advice,

What Maitreya is basically saying is that your insistence on accepting the literal historicity of the Mahayana sutras is not in fact necessary for the Mahayana to be valid.

Malcolm wrote:
No, that is not what he is saying. What he is saying is that whoever wins the result is a Buddha, and whatever he or she explains will be Buddhavacana. Municandra explains:
That being the case, the Mahāyāna is proven to be the word of the Buddha. If it is asked how, the person who comprehends the stages, the perfections and the meaning of no arising and cessation, that person is called "a buddha". Since all the words that person explains are the word of a buddha, Mahāyāna is proven to be the word of the Buddha.
This statement should not be taken as an argument for the ahistoricity of Mahāyāna, because that is not the intent. What it is in fact is a criteria for establishing the authority of the Guru. Maitreya first established that Mahāyāna is historical as I show above.

He also proves that without Mahāyāna there would be no Śravakayāna, since without the bodhisattva path there would be no Buddha. Municandra continues:
If there is no Mahāyāna, there will be no Śravakayāna. If it is asked why, if Mahāyāna does not exist, the path of accomplishing Buddhahood, the accomplishment of Buddhahood will not exist. If Buddhahood was not accomplished, then also since the Hīnayāna will not be explained, then this Hīnayāna that appears like that also will not be the word of the Buddha.
The eight points that Maitreya illustrates are to be take together as a whole argument, i.e. Mahāyāna is the word of the Buddha because 1) it was not predicted to be false 2) because it arose at the same time as the Śravakayāna 3) because it is outside the range of intellectuals and because it not perceived in texts of tīrthikas 4) because it is proven 5) because it exists 6) because it does not not-exist 7) because it is a remedy for the afflictions and 8) because the words are not to be taken literally (i.e. they require interpretation).

We have to accept the historicity of the Mahāyāna because we have the example of the Buddha! That is the whole point of these eight reasons.

My point is that even a partial embrace of Buddhist teachings is better than falling into that kind of thinking. If nothing else, Buddhism provides moral principles and a framework for living a virtuous life. Engaging dhamma even on those limited terms is better for most people's well-being than nurturing an amoral or cynical outlook.

And how would Abhayakaragupta know what happened during the First Council? Why would non-tantrikas take his words as definitive?

Ananda was present in many of the major Mahayana sutras, as already quoted earlier - the prajnaparamitas, vimalakirtinirdesa, etc. How do you explain this?

Malcolm wrote:
Of course Ānanda was present during the teaching of many Mahāyāna sūtras, this is not under dispute.

The point is that Abhayakaragupta is making is that the first council was not a convention for collecting all the teachings of the Buddha. The point he is making is that the first council had an agenda that was limited in its scope.

As an Indian Buddhist, he had access to sources and traditions we do not have. Abhayakaragupta is as likely to know what actually happened during the first council as we are. And Abhayakaragupta's perspective is a confirmation of earlier opinions  voiced by those such as Maitreya and Bhavya.

We know a very great deal about what the Theravadins think about these issues. We know a very great deal about what western academics think about these issues. We know almost nothing about what Indian Mahāyānists think about these issues — but in general, Western Mahāyanists, including Tibetan Buddhists, tend to defer to the latter two groups when it comes to Mahāyāna history and ignore our own historical traditions. I think that is detrimental to Mahāyāna in general.

Mahāyāna proclaims five certainties: time, place, teacher, teaching and retinue, i.e. always; Akaniṣṭha; the Sambhogakāya; Mahāyāna;  Buddhas and bodhisattvas, both emanated and the continuums of others. By contrast, the Śravakayāna is limited in its scope in terms of time, place, teacher, teaching and retinue. Nevertheless, Mahāyāna taught by the nirmanakāya is a localized and temporal instantiation of those teachings, and there are good reasons why the Mahāyāna narratives of their spread ought not be ignored.

Simply put, it means that one embraces the view that there is no result of action, there is no karma, etc. We can understand the general point that Carvaka view was greatly exaggerated by their opponents, but in general, the salient point is that they taught that death was the annihilation of the person.

Not claiming anything of the kind. I am also not engaging in conspiracy theories or speculations. I am reporting what various Indian masters opine based upon the sūtras that they read.

I will leave it for others to engage in speculations and theories about this issue. As for myself, I am content to regard Guhyapati Vajrapani as being the primary collator of the Buddha's sūtras and tantras, as that is the role to which the Buddha appointed him.

Thus, there are three main considerations we need to understand:

1) The Śravakayāna and Mahāyāna arose at the same time, per Maitreyanatha
2) The collators of the Mahāyāna were the major bodhisattvas, Mañjuśrī, Vajrapani and so on per Bhava and so on
3) The person who is represented by "Thus have I heard..." is Vajrapani per Abhayakaragupta

The Vajrapani mentioned in the early Agamas is a yaksha...
As is Vajrapani in Mahāyāna sūtras. He is called "Guhyapati" because is he the master of the Guhyakas.

He is also seldom mentioned in most sutras and in the early Mahayana sutras, he is almost never there. Only in the much later phase of Mahayana does he appear with any regularity.
All these sutras mention him:

Śatasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā
Pañcaviṃśatisahasrika
̄Aṣṭasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā
Aṣṭadaśasahasrika-prajñāpāramitā
Daśasāhasrikā-prajñāpāramitā
Prajñāpāramitānayaśatapañcāśatikā
Pañcaviṃśatika-prajñāpāramitāmukha

In the Akṣobhyasya-tathāgatasyavyūha he is referred as the yakṣapati. The Lalitavistara states he is a yakṣa.The Mahāparinirvāṇa calls him the Yakṣarāja. The Gaganagañjaparipṛcchā calls him Vajrapani the yakṣa, as does the Vikurvāṇarājaparipṛcchā. The Vimalaprabhaparipṛcchā explains that he is the Yakṣarāja, the son of the yakṣa lord, Vaiśravana. The Dānapāramitā calls him the Mahānāyakaḥ, the great chief of all the yakṣas, as does the Nīlāmbaradharavajrapāṇi-rudratrivinaya-tantra, the Vajrapāṇinīlāmbaravidhivajrādaṇḍa-tantra, the Śrī-vajracaṇḍacittaguhya-tantra and the Śrī-vajracaṇḍacittaguhyatantrottarottara, the Vajrabhūmitricaraṇi-rājakalpa-nāma, the Saptatathāgatapūrvapraṇidhānaviśeṣavistara-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra, the Bhagavānbhaiṣajyaguruvaiḍūryaprabhasya-pūrvapraṇidhānaviśeṣavistara-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra, Mahāmaṇivipulavimānaviśvasupratiṣṭhitaguhyaparama-rahasyakalparāja-nāma-dhāraṇī, etc.

Vajrapani is just Vajrapani, whether in the Agamas/Nikayas, Vinaya, or the Vaipulya sūtras.

In short, Vajrapani is a tenth stage bodhisattva born among the Yakṣas.

Sure I have. Unlike you, I am not willing to engage in speculation as to why this was the case, given that Maitreya insists Mahāyāna is contemporary with what we term the "śrāvaka canon" right at the beginning of the Sūtrālaṃkara.

Further, the Vajrapāṇyabhiṣeka tantra and the Tathāgatācintyaguhyanirdeśa mahāyāna sūtra clearly maintain that Vajrapani is actually the collator of the sūtras. Abhayakaragupta states in the Āryāṣṭasāhasrikāprajñāpāramitāvṛttimarmakaumudī:

In the same way, the Tathāgatācintyaguhyanirdeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra explains the complier of "the separate and continuous explanations" and so on is the the lord of the tenth bhumi, the Mahābodhisattva Vajrapani, empowered to protect the rūpakāya and the dharmakāya of the tathāgatas after [the Buddha's] departure and where he is individually entrusted with the teachings in Vajrapāṇyabhiṣeka-sūtra. Whatever was entrusted to Ārya Ānanda, that was employed by the śravakas for the worldly, and not for the purpose of compiling the Dharma. The Bhagava's demonstrated of parinivana here. Because Ārya Vajrapani converts all worlds, he desired to compile the Prajñāpāramita and so on, after which he said "Thus have I heard..." and so on to the assembly of Mahābodhisattvas such as Ārya Maitreya and so on. Just as he heard it from the teacher, afterwards he recited it and in that same way others heard it from him. Thus Vajrapani is the compiler.

The fact that you are "aware that you are aware" makes the fact of awareness itself an object of awareness.

In reply to the claim, "When the śrāvakayāna was explained by the Bhagavan in Śravasti and so on during the time of the śrāvakas, at that time Mahāyāna was not explained. Since the Dharma called "Mahāyāna" arose after the Buddha's parinirvana, the Mahāyāna is not a Dharma of the Buddha", it is stated "because it arose simultaneously". When the Bhagavan was in places such as Śravasti and so on explaining the śrāvakayāna as the minor vehicle, since he explained the Mahāyāna at that time in those places, it is proven that the Mahāyāna is the speech of the Buddha."

And the Buddha totally had no issues teaching Arhats bodhisattva doctrine and practices (as we can see so clearly in the Mahayana sutras), so your reasoning that Mahayana sutras were not recited in the First Council due to different domains is asinine - the Buddha didn't hesitate to teach Arhats bodhisattva doctrine, so if he really taught it when he was flesh-and-blood 2500 years ago, the Arhats would have totally no problem reciting and gathering them.

Malcolm wrote:
So here again, you are putting the śravakas as the authority which defines the validity of the Mahāyāna.

Obviously, we cannot get the Buddha's input on why the first council did not recite his Mahāyāna sūtras because he was not present. And, we do not need to assume every sūtra taught by the Buddha would have been gathered and recited there. This is the fundamental flaw with your thinking. You assume that if it was taught, it must have or should have been recited and the first council, which as far as anyone knows, had no bodhisattvas present. The point Bhava is making is that the first council only recited sūtras relevant to the attainment of the fruit of an arhat, not a bodhisattva or a buddha.

We know that the different groups have different sets of sūtras. The net effect of your implicit supposition is that only the sutras that all groups have in common can be regarded as what the Buddha actually taught; whereas, any sutras this or that group has which are not reflected in the whole collection of all canons must therefore be fakes. This is extremely bad reasoning.

pueraeternus said:
Of course - there is absolutely no good reason why the Mahayana sutras were not recited if they were really taught during the Buddha's earthly life, because even if the Arhats were of a smaller denomination, they were certainly part of the prime audience in many sutras, especially the prajnaparamitas. And the fact that the Buddha instructed Ananda to memorize and preserve the sutras destroys your (and whatever Indian master you favor) contention that only Manjushri and the bodhisattvas preserved the Mahayana canon.

Malcolm wrote:
No, it does not, for the reasons given above. We have no certainty whatsoever that all the sutras the Buddha taught were recited at the first council. Why? Because even different Mainstream canons contain different sets of sūtras.

At base, what should be contested is the supposition that the first council was a comprehensive review of all of the Buddha's teachings. What is our authority for believing this?

Remember, Indian Mahāyāna authors (despite your opinion that they were "asinine" in their belief that the Mahāyāna was not recited at the first council because the bodhisattva path did not concern trainees for arhatship and so on), they were Indian Buddhists, highly educated in their literature, to which they had far more access then we do today.

The scholarship on the subject tells only that which we have already known for centuries: Mahāyāna sūtras were not recited during the first council, but began to be written down about the same time as the Agamas and Nikāyas.

We can see that the two most seminal authors in Mahāyāna, Nāgārjuna and Maitreya, both defended the validity of Mahāyāna in the face of Mainstream Buddhist attacks.

These are the only facts about them which we have at our disposal.

There are traditional accounts about how Mahāyāna was preserved. Those accounts clearly tell us that the Mahāyāna sūtras were all authored by the Buddha personally.

Then there is the point of view of western academics about the origin of these texts, which itself is purely speculative. It clearly tells us that not one of these texts was authored by the Buddha, that in effect it is an impossibility.

The net effect of following the latter position is that Mahāyāna is invalidated, the bodhisattva path and so on. The net effect of following the former position is that the Mahāyāna is validated, the bodhisattva path and so on.

The dichotomy is necessary precisely because of how western academia has framed the reception of Mahāyāna. We are no longer in the phase where Mahāyāna is merely a curiosity for Sanskritists.

Most people's encounter with Mahāyāna starts with a survey course book, in which is the maintained that Mahāyāna was never taught by Śakyamuni in person, but rather at best it consisted of pious fictions, or possibly visions, by anonymous groups of people in various parts of India.

But when for example, Buton Rinchen Drup maintains that that the Mahāyāna was collated by bodhisattvas on Mt.

Oh yes, I am sure that the Buddha didn't intend only "Samantabhadra, Mañjuśrī, Guhyapati, Maitreya and so on" to compile the Mahayana sutras, since he directly gave instructions to Ananda to memorize and preserve many. And the fact that Arhats were present, many spoke and many rejoiced, and Ananda asked "what shall this wonderful sutra be called?", shows that the Buddha didn't intend to exclude them.

Malcolm wrote:
Many, as we see, is four or five. Ānanda of course was not an arhat while Buddha was alive.

But we are talking about compilers of these texts. Ananda did not hear all of the sūtras the Buddha taught. He did not compile them all. For example, in the Ānanda sutra, the Buddha states:
Anything the Bhagavan taught before, he [Ānanda] does not hold those. It is not reasonable to say "Teach them again to him" because they reside in some other bhikṣus.
Thus it is not established at all that Ananda was even the sole compiler of the Mainstream Canon. Bhava argues there were several compilers.

pueraeternus said:
Of course he appears in many Mahāyāna sūtras, but Ananda was not the compiler of Mahāyāna.
He was. The Buddha said so in many Mahayana sutras.

Malcolm wrote:
There is only one such statement as far as I can tell, found in the Mahākaruṇāpuṇḍarīka sūtra. Buddha here asked Ānanda to gather whatever the Buddha said.

However the Tathāgatācintyaguhyanirdeśa-sūtra asserts that Vajrapani is the compiler of all the sūtras of the Buddhas of the Bhadrakalapa.

Despite this contradiction, it is definitely the case that Bhava has a rather lengthy discussion about the issue of the compilation of the sūtras and he rejects the notion that they were compiled by the śrāvakas.

pueraeternus said:
Oh, but he and other Arhats appeared in plenty of the early Mahayana sutras - that itself would be more than sufficient for the teachings to be gathered during the First Council.

One, Tibetan "astrology" is not astrology in the sense you understand it. The term in Tibetan is "calculation", so here we are calculating the cycle of the phases in the five elements— wood, fire, earth, metal and water— through the year, through the month and through the day.

Tibetan elemental calculation is very general, and it serves only as a sort of weather report, i.e., when rain is predicted, it may not necessarily rain in your area, but you are wise to bring an umbrella. It is the same with elemental calculation, if it indicates that this or that person will have obstacles in a given year, it is sound to make do practices to prevent this.

Lungta flags are blessed by you, and there is a mantra, so there is a definite connection between your energy and the flags themselves. They also harmonize the five elements of a place because they are consecrated to do so. Whenever you see them, you should also recite that mantra, since it is increases their benefit for you.

It reminds me of the common criticism found in the popular versions of Mahayana (e.g. Zen and Tantra), that the common path of the bodhisattva, as it is actually presented by most of the sutras, takes too long and it is too difficult. What hardly anyone dares to consider is that those popular versions actually teach sravakayana under the pretence of "buddhahood in this life". Also, both Zen and Tantra are famous for emphasising discipleship (sravaka-hood). So, I'd add to Bhikkhu Bodhi's quote that hardly anyone wants to take the bodhisattva path, and all the arguments against Theravada are practically valid against the same people who use them.

Malcolm wrote:
"Buddhahood in the this life" means completing the two accumulations which lead to both freedom and omniscience.

It is impossible for someone to has generated bodhicitta to experience the fruit of an arhat, i.e. cessation, indeed, it is against the very principles of the bodhisattva path to do so.

The issue is, whether there is 'the consciousness' that 'goes' from life to life. Sati is rebuked for saying that there is. But the fact that there isn't something the same that goes from life to life, doesn't solve the problem of karma.  If there is no agent, then to whom does karma accrue? There is clearly continuity in that sense. After all, if you say there is no karma, then you're a nihilist. So how does karma not pertain to agent?

Malcolm wrote:
There is no continuous agent, no atman, which transfers from this world to the next world [or even from this moment to the next], but the aggregates are serially connected, as Nāgārjuna shows in the Pratītyasamutpādakarikas.

how is it that none of that survived in the FIrst Council?

Malcolm wrote:
These sūtras were not compiled at the first council.

In the Madhyamakahṛdayavṛttitarkajvālā, Bhava reports:
Mahāyāna was spoken by the Buddha because it does not contradict the Dharma seals, one is introduced to the sūtra canon of the noble truth; because the afflicted are truly seen to be tamed; and because it does not conflict with dependent origination — all of those said to be "spoken by the Buddha" are found in Mahāyāna. Further, also each of the eighteen schools each introduce their own canon, but there are a great many mutual contradictions [between them]. The profound and vast methods of benefitting others in Mahāyāna are not introduced at all in the sutra canon of the śravakas. Mahāyāna introduces the bodhisattva training appearing in seven hundred topics. Because the teaching of emptiness does not contradict the Dharma itself, therefore, the Dharma seals are not contradicted. Due to this, Mahāyāna was spoken by the Buddha because the compilers of the basic [texts],  Samantabhadra, Mañjuśrī, Guhyapati, Maitreya and so on, compiled them. The compilers of our basic [texts]  were not the śravakas because Mahāyāna discourses are not their domain.
In other words,  though the arhats were present at Mahāyāna teachings, it was not the path they were on, and not the path they wanted to preserve since they did not have the bodhisattva motivation. Thus, they compiled only the teachings they found relevant for nirvana and ignored those which treated the Bodhisattva path and did not memorize them or recite them.

Bhava reports a citation from a text called the Śālmalīvana-sutra *:
Ānanda, I comprehend even more Dharma than however many leaves there are in this śālmalī grove, but I have not taught them to you. Since that many were taught for a purpose, you must not be regretful, but you should also not be without desire [to hear them].
In response to the qualm that Ānanda heard all of the sutras:
If it is said "Ārya Ānanda comprehended all of the sūtras", with respect to that, the Uttama sūtra* states: "There is not even one bhikṣu holding the number of Dharmas held by Śakra, the king of the devas." Since that is so, Ānanda did not hold all of the Dharma. Therefore, the vast teachings of the Buddha are not seen in that authentic compilation Ānanda demonstrated and compiled authentically.
Bhava continues in this vein for quite some time. The point is that a) arhats did not preserve all the teachings of the Buddha b) Ānanda did not know all of the sūtras.

So, you are saying that "the Buddha taught them" is not hermeneutics, it is simple fact, while the hermeneutics taught therein are valid, etc. because of this authorship by the historical Buddha, in the same way that the Nikayas are valid because of their authorship -- because the historical Buddha taught the content.

Parsing anything about this - such as e.g. that the Nikayas are stratified and not wholly Buddhavacana, or that Mahayana is wholly later... all of that, to any historian, text-critical examiner, etc, the reply is that
Adopting the western text critical view of Mahāyāna sūtras is not virtuous.
Do I understand correctly?
Indeed you do. Indeed, Theravadins should adopt precisely the same attitude —why? Because these days even the Pali Canon is coming under attack from the very same forces who initially caused Mahāyāna to fall into disrepute.

In short, it is not virtuous to regard teachings in the Agamas/Nikāyas and well as the Mahāyāna canon to be anything other than taught by the Buddha. I am not insisting that of adherents of the Mainstream canons necessarily must accord validity to Mahāyāna canon; or those who are adherents of common Mahāyāna necessarily must accept Vajrayāna — they should remain a place free of judgement. But for those of us who are Mahāyānis and Vajrayānis, well, it is better for us to simply accept all these teachings as the teachings of the historical Buddha where it is so indicated, unless there are absolutely compelling reasons to believe otherwise.

It certainly should not be take as evidence that the Mahāyāna sūtras are not the Buddha's own words. But most Westerners are dependent upon philologists who were biased towards the Pali canon as being the "authentic" Buddhism of the Buddha. And quite frankly, they have constructed a picture of Buddhism that we inherit and generally buy into without second thoughts. The entire history of Mahāyāna studies in the Academy begins from the premise that Mahāyāna sūtras are later literary fabrications.

I think the origin of the Mahayana Sutras is from 'visionary encounters' with the Buddha which could be understood as 'seeing the dharma by penetrating its meaning' or as 'insight into the true meaning of the Buddha's teaching through Prajñāpāramitā.' These insights were then codified into the Prajñāpāramitā sutras, amongst others.

Understood thus, I have always thought that these texts were the authentic word, even if not literally remembered and spoken in the same way as the early texts.

Instead it better to simply insist, "This is the sūtra that we read, if you do not read this sūtra, it is better for you to be neutral, than run the risk of abandoning Dharma." In this way one's point of view is unassailable when it comes to explicating points where the Buddha's teaching in Mahāyāna sūtras surpasses or seem to contradict those teachings found in the Mainstream canons.

It is possible that one interpretation of what the Buddha said is more authoritative than another interpretation, but resorting to authority is my last resort for understanding what the Buddha said.

The Buddha said many things and unless one is as awakened as the Buddha himself, practically whatever he said would be interpreted by one's intellect.  What is important as far as I am concerned is the consistency of interpretation (understanding) of one aspect with other aspects of the Buddha's teachings.

The text from 793-794 mentiones that it is advice given to her on Guru Rinpoche's departure from Tibet.

Thus, we can see here that the Khon tradition clearly mentions her. Its very unlikely that Jetsun Rinpoche would be following the lead of Nyangral, given how stringent Sakyapas are about lineage, and how dubious they were about the nascent gter ma tradition. In my opinion, we can safely say that this advice was included in their ancestral teachings.

Therefore, I personally see no valid reason whatsoever to doubt the historicity of a Tibetan woman named Yeshe Tsogyal who was Padmasambhava's companion.

That's not a Mahayana perspective. A Mahayanaist would understand the Arhat to have a continuation. In fact, the Mahayana perspective says that after a long while the Arhats are roused out of their sleep by the blessing of the bodhisattvas so they can continue on with the practice of the Mahayana.

Three things are required to turn the tide of Buddhist modernism, especially of the academic variety:

1) We must resist the temptation to fall under the spell of text criticism. The text critical approach is forensic and speculative. It proceeds from Western hermeneutical prejudices founded in a materialist notion of what a "text" is. It also is born out of a Western idea of historiography. Text criticism, used as a means of discerning the origin of Buddhist texts and its developments, results in nothing more than speculative conjectures being taken as facts by the reading public, and by many Buddhists as well. These speculative conjectures harm the foundations of Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna in particular, which are seen as modifications or corruptions of an ur-canon.

2) We must resist the attempt to erect science as our final authority in all matters of cosmology, theories of consciousness, etc. While not disregarding modern science and so on, we must insist that domain of Buddhadharma is necessarily outside of scientific inquiry. The origin of Buddhadharma is the awakening of the Buddha. There is no way the mundane sciences can either enhance our understanding of Dharma nor can it replace the Dharma.

3) We must insist that on fact the Buddhist canon, all sutra, tantra and Vajrayāna originate with the Buddhas in general, and Śakyamuni Buddha in particular. We must take into consideration that the very survival of Buddhism as a living tradition depends on the integrity of the origins of the teachings. In particular, we must insist on the necessity that the timeless teachings of the Buddhas transcend mundane concerns about space and time, existing as a remedy for the suffering of all sentient beings, wherever they may be. Therefore, the teachings of the Buddhas, whether directly, by permission or by blessing should be accepted as they are at face value as the teaching of the Buddha. It is only in this way that the integrity of the Buddhist tradition will be preserved. This is not to say that all Buddhists must accept all canons as being of equal value. We need to recognize that all the Buddha's teachings have value for different people at different stages in their evolution on the path.

Therefore, engaging with people addicted to text criticism or historical analysis of Buddhist texts, or who have aim to replace key concepts in Buddhadharma with concepts drawn from the mundane sciences should be considered extraneous distractions and such people's qualms and objections must be ignored, because trying to deflect or negate such misguided criticisms of materialists, made by non-practitioners, or Theravadin practitioners is completely useless. If they say Mahāyāna is not the teaching of the Buddha, we must insist that it is. If they claim the Vajrayāna teachings are not the teaching of the Buddha, we insist that it is. If they claim that termas are not the teaching of the Buddha, we insist that they are and leave it at that. Many long, stupid conversations will be blunted in the beginning by a simple statement "This is a teaching of the Buddha. If you don't think so, you are welcome to your opinion but I am not interested in discussing it with you further." Such discussions are not useful for anyone's practice, their's, if they have one, or ours. Further, we create much non-virtue and negative traces by engaging in such discussions.

When rebirth is debated it should be kept in mind that rebirth is something to be overcome. It is something that needs to be seen as false.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, that is the point of Buddhadharma, overcoming rebirth. Not merely as a concept, but in actuality. You seem to be proposing the only thing we need to overcome is the idea of rebirth. Well, materialists don't need to since they have no idea of rebirth. Maybe they are already liberated. At death, poof, nirvana.

The point is, A108, without rebirth, there is no need for Buddhadharma per se.

One thing these videos have given me is just the opportunity to see how a Pure Land Buddhist priest thinks and acts.  Rev.

Very much so, as Garland of Pearls Tantra [one of seventeen tantras] states:

One is placed in the dungeon of name and matter
in the castle of the three realms,
tortured with the barbs of ignorance and so on,

attached to the salty taste of desire, 
bound by the neck with the noose of confusion, 
burned with the hot fire of hatred, 
head covered with pride, 
setting a rendezvous with the mistress of jealousy, 
surrounded by the army of enmity...
tied by the neck with the noose of subject and object, [29b]
stuck in the mud of successive traces
and handcuffed with the ripening of karma.
Having been joined with the ripening of karma, 
one takes bodies good and bad, 
one after another like a water wheel,
born into each individual class.
Having crossed at the ford of self-grasping, 
one sinks into the ocean of suffering
and one is caught by the heart on the hook of the three lowers realms.
One is bound by oneself; the afflictions are the enemy.

The whole purpose of practicing rushan, especially outer rushan, is to eliminate the causes of birth in the six lokas.

No, Buddhadharma has never been modified. Over the centuries however, more of the Buddha's teachings have been revealed, to help people cope with evolving circumstances.



Andrew108 said:
In the Samadhanga Sutta Buddha says:
"If he wants, he recollects his manifold past lives,[3] i.e., one birth, two births, three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one thousand, one hundred thousand, many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion, [recollecting], 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he remembers his manifold past lives in their modes and details. He can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening."

So we should take this literally right?

Malcolm wrote:
It is intended literally. There is nothing here to dispute, conventionally speaking.

Andrew108 said:
But one wonders how could it be possible? How could all these memories survive so many lives when there were lives where we didn't have language or developed senses capable of recording and storing that information. Why was it that the Buddha couldn't talk about the evolution of species or what life was like on other planets. It seems that life on other planets was much like life on this one?

Malcolm wrote:
Life in Sukhavati for example, is nothing like life on this one.


Andrew108 said:
How does this memory survive after brain death? What is it about consciousness that enables it to contain so much information and why is that information not ordinarily available to us? Then there is a kind of folkism here where memory is seen like a serial display and that one needs only rewind to uncover past events. It seems if you develop the jhanas then that is the kind of capacity you will have. The way you remember things will be serial.

Malcolm wrote:
In general, for ordinary beings, the shock of being unconscious at the moment of conception is said to render our past live memories unavailable. Bodhisattvas in their last life however are conscious through the entire process of conception, gestation and birth.

When one enters into the concentration of recalling past lives, indeed one starts with this life and that starts with the present and works one's way back.

Memory is serial because consciousness is serial. Memory, as I already explained to you from Candrakirti, is not different than the consciousness that experienced the event. So the process consists of recalling every serial sense impression from beginningless time.

Consciousness is empty, there is nothing preventing consciousness from recalling all of its past objects other than our present obscurations. Just as there is nothing preventing karma from ripening because karma too is empty.

But if you try to understand these things in physicalist terms it will never make any sense.

Without the teaching of rebirth, the Buddha's Dharma is no more than a set of moral platitudes. It ceases to be a path of liberation, and becomes a mere palliative for life's ailments, rather than a cure.

All these things are uncommon, JK, but in a sadhana, the merit and wisdom accumulations are completed even before you start in on the main section. And the main section of the sadhana is nothing or nor less than a reenactment of Buddha's awakening and deeds through nirvana.

Yes, it is true that creation stage is a cause for realizing the rūpakāya, just as the completion stage is a cause for realizing the dharmkāya. But superior even to the the two stages is guru yoga, which along with mandala offerings are truly unique to anuttarayoga tantra.

Central Tibet remained without any effective government at all, apart from warlords, until Pho lha nas, an aristocrat from Tsang, ruled Tibet from 1727-1748 with Qing backing.

Quite frankly, there are no players who do not participate willing in the Global economy. I know it is fun to point fingers at the US, but in reality, the environmental degradation we are experiencing was caused by all countries who industrialized.

This East/West thing is really misguided — ya'll need to read Edward Said.

Malcolm wrote:
Buddha, in Mahāyāna sutras, was acting out of his infinite and omniscient compassion. Not only that, while Śariputra may seem like a foil against which many unkind tricks were played, Śariputra in fact is a very high bodhisattva on the stages, a player in the drama of the Mahāyāna sutras.

I think that until I am at that level, I will refrain from criticizing the other vehicles.

Of course, when we openly discuss the fact that Vajrayāna promises the ideal practitioner full buddhahood replete with the two accumulations in a single life, it is natural that others might feel criticized or that we are making "triumphalist claims", but we are not. There isn't even one single Mainstream sutra or Mahāyāna sūtra that suggests that full buddhahood can be attained in a single life, so what need to mention the complete absence of the methods of doing so? Moreover, the Mainstream Sūtras do not detail the path of the bodhisattva, so people who wish the embark on the career of a bodhisattva must learn that from Mahāyāna sūtras. The Mainstream sūtra teachings have one goal primarily, to guide people to the four fruits of the śravakas path.

Malcolm wrote:
Well for example, in Mahāyāna sūtras, it very clearly explains that the Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī actually attained samyakasambuddhahood countless eons ago. If it is the case that in Mahāyāna they accepted the statement in the Dhātubahuka-sūtra as authoritative, how is it that Mañjuśrī could appear as a disciple of the Buddha? For example,in the bKa' 'gyur, the translated words of the Buddha, the Ārya-mañjuśrīnāmāṣṭaśataka praises Mañjuśrī in the following words:
You are a Buddha, a pratyekabudddha,
and you are the Primordial Buddha.
How can this be possible, if the Dhātubahuka-sūtra is to be regarded as definitive?

Further, to underscore the point that Mahāyāna sūtras are more definitive for Mahāyāna followers than Mainstream Buddhist Sūtras, consider the following from the Arya-sandhinirmocana-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:
At first, since the Bhagavan demonstrated the aspects of the four noble truths to those correctly participating in the vehicle in the deer park called Ṛṣivadanam, the amazing Dharma wheel he turned first was amazing, a corresponding Dharma had not been turned in the past by any deva nor any human. However, that Dharma wheel that the Bhagavan turned was surpassable, contextual, of provisional meaning, and a basis for contention. The Bhagavan turned a second very amazing Dharma wheel with the aspects beginning with the absence of inherent existence of phenomena, and beginning with their nonarising, noncessation, peace from the beginning, and intrinsic parinirvana to those correctly participating in the Mahāyāna. However, that Dharma Wheel turned by the Bhagavan too was surpassable, contextual, of provisional meaning, and a basis for contention. The Bhagavan then turned the third very amazing Dharma Wheel perfectly differentiating for those correctly participating in all vehicles beginning with the absence of inherent existence of phenomena, and beginning with their nonarising, noncessation, peace from the beginning, and intrinsic parinirvana. This Dharma Wheel turned by the Bhagavan is unsurpassable, not circumstantial, definitive in meaning, and not a basis of contention.
Here you can see that Mahāyāna sūtra, the teaching of the Mahāyāna is clearly defined as definitive. while the teaching of the Mainstream Buddhists, the Agamas and so on are defined as provisional in meaning, etc.

Such persons therefor are nirmanakāyas, known as "nirmanakāyas through birth" because they have fully completed both stores of wisdom and merit and are completely free from the two obscurations.

Kundalini yoga in the Natha Sampradaya and Vajrayana in Tibetan Buddhism both take their origin from the Mahasiddhas who were active in India from the 8th century to the 12th century. Kundalini yoga practices formed the core of the teachings of a number of these Mahasiddhas and are strongly represented in both Tibetan Buddhist practices and contemporary kundalini yoga practices. Kundalini yoga was spoken of as "Candali yoga" by these Mahasiddhas and became known as gTummo rnal 'byor in Tibet. Candali yoga was a key practice of the famous Tibetan yogin Milarepa.

How does this claim fit in the picture?

What little I've heard or read of tummo, they have to do with breathing, moving attention and visualising in the central channel in the spine. I don't mean to be a drag Malcolm but what you say is a major surprise for me. If spine practices nor kundalini energy are utilised what do they/you guys do then? No specific information needed, just general remarks with slight explanations, please.

"If, when I attain Buddhahood, sentient beings in the lands of the ten quarters, who awaken aspiration for Enlightenment, do various meritorious deeds and sincerely desire to be born in my land, should not, at their death, see me appear before them surrounded by a multitude of sages, may I not attain perfect Enlightenment."

And vow 46:

"If, when I attain Buddhahood, bodhisattvas in my land should not be able to hear spontaneously whatever teachings they may wish, may I not attain perfect Enlightenment."

Malcolm wrote:
These three statements have nothing to do with buddhahood in one lifetime. There is a very strong Amitabha tradition in Tibetan Buddhism, it is an important practice for millions of Tibetans. Karma Chagme has the mostly beautiful aspiration prayer for birth in Sukhavati and there are several important commentaries written on these topics.

And Buddha was not the founder of Buddhadharma. Buddhadharma has existed for eons and eons in many different expressions. Sometimes there is a monastic Sangha, sometimes there isn't a monastic Sangha and so on.

In any case, if you want to understand the difference between the bodhi of an Arhat and a Bodhisattva, you should read Maitreya's Abhisamayālaṃkara, which explains the Prajñāpāramitasūtras treatment of the bodhi of arhats and so on.

There are also differences in the depth of emptiness taught in the Mainstream Canon, i.e. the Agamas and Nikayas.

So, yes, the Vajrayāna does speed up the process, because unlike common Mahāyāna where emptiness is the result, etc., Vajrayāna experientially introduces the wisdom to be realized right at the very beginning.

In this way, each and every sentient being is fully shown a cloud of kāyas being born; each and every sentient being is fully shown a cloud of nirmanakāyas; each and every sentient being is fully shown a cloud of kāyas of blessings; each and every sentient being is fully shown a cloud of rūpakāyas; each and every sentient being is fully shown a cloud of full accomplished variegated kāyas; each and every sentient being is fully shown a cloud of punyakāyas; each and every sentient being is fully shown a cloud of jñānakāyas; each and every sentient being is fully shown a cloud of unconquerable strong kāyas; each and every sentient being is fully shown a cloud of fearless splendid kāyas.
The Lanka states:
In delightful Akaniṣṭha,
beyond the pure abodes,
the true Buddha becomes a Buddha;
an emanated one becomes a Buddha here.
So you see, there is no reason any number of persons cannot become Buddha here on Jambudvipa, because Buddhas do not, according to Mahāyāna, actually attain buddhahood here anyway.

But considering that most of us are not going to, and seeing that the Buddha taught that release is possible in this lifetime too, I think it takes the wind out of the Vajra claim. As far as I can make out, the speediest path is the one that one is ready to commit to fully, and the one with the right teacher and Sangha.

No one doubts that the Mainstream Buddhist path brings about freedom, in the sense of full freedom from afflictions, that is the awakening of an arhat or a pratyekabuddha.

28.   Open Your Own Treasure House

Daiju visited the master Baso in China. Baso asked: "What do you seek?"

"Enlightenment," replied Daiju.

"You have your own treasure house. Why do you search outside?" Baso asked.

Daiju inquired: "Where is my treasure house?"

Baso answered: "What you are asking is your treasure house."

Daiju was enlightened! Ever after he urged his friends: "Open your own tresure house and use those treasures."

In Mahāyāna, and especially Vajrayāna, it is considered possible for there to be more than one nirmanakāya during a given Buddha's dispensation. However, it is only possible for there to be one supreme Nirmanakāya during any given dispensation in any given world system.

I have to keep repeating myself because you are not understanding the implications of what I am saying. If consciousness is self-sustaining after death or even supported by 'warmth' (as per Malcolm) then it has energy. If it has energy it can be measured. That is it. We don't need to enter into a philosophical debate about the nature of energy. Just that consciousness, as described by Malcolm who claims to accurately represent the Buddhist view, has characteristics that should be measurable.

Yes and no.

There is no means for realizing total buddhahood in Mainstream Buddhism, not in Theravada, not in Sarvastivada nor in Dharmaguptaka, the only three Mainstream Buddhist schools left.

In Mahāyāna, total Buddhahood takes a minimum of three incalculable eons, for the best practitioner.

In Vajrayāna, total Buddhahood can be realized in a single lifetime by the best practitioner, but even if you do not practice, as long as you maintain your vows perfectly, one will achieve total Buddha within seven lifetimes.

You can either accept or reject these accounts as you wish. There is really nothing to argue about. Incidentally, I am merely reporting the assertions made in these schools. Whether one accepts these assertions or not depends upon one's own inclinations.

That does not really answer the question. It is not a question whether science is "honest" -- indeed, there is as much faith and zeal among scientists in scientific endeavor as there is in evangelical Christians. The question is, can you reconcile what you truly have faith in, i.e. science, with the Buddha's teachings? Unlike Andrew, for example, I don't think that science as gotten at what consciousness is, they don't have the math for it, consciousness cannot be mathematically modeled. I don't think that science will ever be able to get at consciousness because consciousness is not a physical process, in the end, even though nama and rūpa do interact. But the interaction is strictly one way, consciousness interacts with matter, matter does not interact with consciousness. Our brains, our physical eyes, our body are all, in essence, inert matter, conventionally speaking (forget about going into higher Buddhist teachings like Dzogchen where matter is merely the reified luminosity of consciousness). Chemical processes do not amount to consciousness. There is no experiment that can produce consciousness. Consciousness cannot be created in a lab. There is no way to verify experimentally what consciousness is at all, that is, not by any means known to western science. But there is a means to know these things and it involves personally developing the skills to verify the Buddha's teachings on such issues. It's not hard, per se, you just have to be dedicated, and do the work.

Fundamentally, speaking, according to Vajrayāna texts, the extraordinary difference in time is due to the fact that Vajrayāna pratices uses the body as the vehicle for liberation, as well as other special methods, that allow a very serious practitioner to gather the two accumulations that normally require three eons in a single lifetime.

Using the "body as the vehicle for liberation." Yeah that's right. Kind of like what the Buddha was saying here:

No, the mental faculty (lets not call it an organ since that is really not the right term) is the immediately preceding moment of consciousness.

The point here is that the mental organ and the moment of consciousness can't exist at the same time. So one must precede the other and therefore you have continuity based on a continuing mental organ and moment of consciousness. Here continuing mental organ is no other than functional 'substrate' for continuing moment of consciousness.

There is a continuing mental faculty in as much as this moment of consciousness always arises on the basis of the previous moment; the immediately antecedent moment of consciousness is always the mental faculty.

Seeds and sprouts cannot exist at the same time, still, sprouts come from seeds, and produce other seeds all in good time, when there is proper cause and condition.

It obviously corresponds with Madhyamaka teachings since Candrakirti instructs us that the functions of memory and so on are worldly conventions, and as such should not be examined.

Still, since we are deluded, in the refined sense of not being free from grasping at self, for us conventional truth is where we live.

Unknown said:
Consciousness is driven by thirst for existence.

Malcolm wrote:
So it has that kind of characteristic? How does it know to strive for existence? Or is it like a seed striving to find the light? Is it instinctive? If so then how can a massless thing like consciousness also have instinct and striving?
As before, consciousness is that which knows objects. When it is contaminated, it experiences craving.

Well, what I am is a follower of Buddhadharma. One of the reasons that I eschew the label "Buddhist" for myself is that I am not any particular kind of Buddhist. The term "Buddhist" in many ways is too limiting. I have met "Buddhists" who imagine that because they are Buddhists they cannot take teachings from teachers in other streams of Dharma outside Buddhadharma. I personally have no problem with it. That is why I follow Dharma, and Buddhadharma in particular. All Dharma religions, incidentally, accept rebirth.

However, I have also found that conventionally, it is easier to resort to the term Buddhism and Buddhist in common conversations with others.

I am somewhat confused with this idea of reaching Buddhahood in this very lifetime: I've learned that part of Vajrayana is taking the Bodhisattva vows, where we pledge to *not* take up Buddhahood asap but to postpone it until all beings all liberated. If this is so, how does it fit in with the fast path to Buddhahood? Or is it the case that Vajrayana is not always a Bodhisatva-based approach?



Malcolm wrote:
There are three different types of bodhisattva vows: like a king, like a captain, and like a shepherd.

The king-like bodhisattva vow involves the wish to achieve buddhahood as soon as possible, in order to guide others to that state, like a king ruling a country.
The captain-like bodhisattva vow involves the wish to achieve buddhahood at the same time as all other sentient beings, like a captain arriving in port at the same time as his passengers.
The shepherd-like bodhisattva vow involves attaining buddhahood only after all sentient beings have attained buddhahood, like a shepherd who only rests after his flock is safely penned for the night.

Vajrayāna uses the first of these. In other words, our bodhisattva vow states " May I attain the state of Buddhahood in order to place all other sentient beings in that state."

Malcolm wrote:
Here is a random sampling, running a quick word search on the pdf you provided from Shasta Abbey. From these samplings you can Dogen was a follower of Mainstream Buddhism, and took the idea of rebirth quite literally.

The kesa, from ancient times, has been called ‘the garment of liberation’, for
it can free us from all our obstructions, be they from the karmic* effects of our past
deeds, from our defiling passions, or from the effects of our rebirth in one of the
six worlds* of existence.


What we call the three temporal periods are the three time periods in which
we receive the retribution from our good and evil acts. These are, first, the
retribution experienced in one’s present life; second, the retribution experienced in
one’s next life; and third, the retribution experienced in some later future life.
Through your practice of the Way of the Buddhas and Ancestors you learn, first
off, to clarify what the principle of karmic retribution in these three time periods is.
If you do not do so, you will make many errors and fall into false views. You will
not just fall into false views, you will also give rise to evil ways and undergo
suffering for a long time. By failing to continue developing your good roots, you
will lose much spiritual merit and will have long-standing obstructions on your
path to enlightenment.
The karmic retribution experienced in these three temporal periods comes
from both good and evil acts.

Right view is a gate to what the Dharma illumines, for by
means of it we can realize the Saintly Path and
exhaust the stream of rebirths.
Right thought is a gate to what the Dharma illumines, for
by means of it we eliminate all discriminatory
judgments, as well as any lack of discernment.
Right speech is a gate to what the Dharma illumines, for
by means of it we will recognize that all names,
voicings, and words are simply like vibrations.
Right livelihood is a gate to what the Dharma illumines,
for by means of it we rid ourselves of all our evil
ways.
Right action is a gate to what the Dharma illumines, for
by means of it we arrive at the Other Shore.
Right mindfulness is a gate to what the Dharma
illumines, for by means of it we do not
intellectualize all thoughts and things.
Right concentration is a gate to what the Dharma
illumines, for by means of it we can attain the
meditative state that is beyond scattered thoughts.

It is clear that the desire to be reborn within the human world is something longed
for even by a Lord Yama. Once someone has been reborn as a human being, he or
she should forthwith have their head shaved, don the kesa of the Three Treasures,
and take up the study of the Way of the Buddha. These are the merits of being
within the world of humans, which surpasses the other five worlds of existence.
But to be born in the human world and then to wantonly seek out the path to
political power or some other worldly career, vainly spending one’s life as a toady
to ministers and kings, wrapping oneself up in fantasies and dreams, only to
proceed in later times towards pitch darkness without anything to rely upon, that is
folly indeed! Not only have you received the body of a human being, which is hard
to come by, but you have also encountered the Buddha Dharma, which is hard to
encounter. You should forthwith cast aside all your involvements and quickly leave
home life behind in order to study the Way. Rulers and ministers, along with their
wives and children, their relatives and households, are encountered everywhere,
but the Buddha Dharma, like the rare udumbara blossom, is hard to meet up with.
In short, when impermanence suddenly arrives, there is no ruler or minister, friend
or relative, spouse or child, or any precious treasure that will save us, for each of us
simply returns to death’s Yellow Spring alone.24 What follows along with us is
simply our good and bad karma. When we are about to lose our human body, our
feelings of regret for our human body may well be deep indeed! So, while we still
have our human body, we should quickly leave home life behind. Just this alone
will be the true Teaching of the Buddhas of the three temporal worlds.

When all bodhisattvas who are bound to be reborn one final time are
about to descend from the Tushita Heaven to be born in the land of Jambudvipa,*
they invariably proclaim the one hundred and eight gates to what the Dharma
illumines for the sake of the celestial multitudes in the Tushita Heaven, and thereby
pass on the Teaching to those celestial ones, for this is the invariable method of
Buddhas.

After darkness has come before our eyes, we should, right off, strive to recite
the Three Refuges, not shirking from this even during our entering the intermediate
world or our next birth. In this way, we should thoroughly expend life after life
and, in age after age, reverently recite Them.

Once you have given rise to the intention to seek enlightenment, even
though you are spinning about through the six worlds* of existence, being born
through any of the four modes of birth, the very causes and conditions of your
spinning will become your heartfelt practice of enlightenment.

We do not know how many rounds of birth and death we have already spent
returning again and again to various useless delusions, even while possessing this
wisdom. It is like rocks covering up a jewel: the jewel is unaware that it is covered
up by rocks and the rocks are unaware that they are covering up a jewel. When
human beings recognize this jewel, they seize upon it. This is not something that
the jewel expectantly awaits nor is it something that the rocks have been waiting
for, and it does not depend on a spiritual awakening on the part of the rocks nor is
it something that the jewel thinks about. That is to say, even though a human being
and wisdom are unaware of each other, the Way is invariably overheard by the
person’s wisdom.

pensum said:
However, Dogen's views on life and death are somewhat more nuanced than that found in typical discussions of "literal rebirth"; to wit, this excerpt from the Bendowa, the first chapter of Dogen's Shobogenzo: Question: Someone has said, "Do not reject life and death. There is an
easy shortcut to freedom from life and death. This is knowing that the
essence of the mind is eternal. This means that although this body is born
and inevitably progresses towards death, this mental essence does not
perish. If you understand that this mental essence that is not subject to
arising and ceasing resides in my body is the original mental essence; and
so, while the body takes a temporal form but is always inconstant, born here
and dying there, this mental essence is eternal and does not change in past,
present, and future. To know this is to be free from birth and death. For
those who know this, the birth and death they have known up to now vanish,
and they enter into an ocean of the mental essence. Entering this ocean,
they have wonderous virtues like the Buddhas and Tathagatas. Even if you
know this now, because your body is the result of former delusive actions,
you differ from the sages. Those who do not know this principle turn in the
cycle of life and death eternally. So you only need to know this principle of
the eternal mental essence. If you sit in vain you waste your whole life. What
can you possibly hope for?"
Does this view conform to the Way of the Buddhas and Ancestors?
Answer: This view is not the Buddha Dharma at all. It is the Senika view
which is skewed outside of the Way. This skewed view says: "In our body
there is a ghostly intelligence and it is through this that, as conditions
occur, we have the capacity to distinguish between like and dislike, right
and wrong, pain and stimulation, and suffering and pleasure. When the body
dies, this ghostly intelligence is released from here and is born some place
else. Therefore, though it seems to die here, it is born there, it is immortal
and eternal." This is that view skewed outside the Way.
If you learn about this and think it is the Buddha Dharma, it is sillier
than holding a tile or pebble and thinking it to be golden treasure. This
foolishness is beyond anything to compare it to and is an embarrassment.
The National Master Huizhong of Tang China strongly warned against this view.
Those who hold this delusive view think that "the mind is eternal and
that appearance is transitory" and equate this with the wonderous Dharma
of the Buddhas and think that they have broken free from life and death; but
this is the original cause of life and death. Isn't this shamefully silly? This
is nothing but a deluded view skewed outside of the Way. Don't let your ears
touch it.
Still, I need to address this issue, and so I will now rectify this
delusion out of compassion. Understand that in the Buddha Dharma body
and mind are single; nature and form are spoken of as not-two. This is
known throughout both the Western heavens and Eastern lands and is
beyond any doubt. In a school that talks about eternity, the myriad things
are all eternal and body and mind is undivided. In a school that talks about
cessation, all things are ceasing and nature and form are not divided.
How can you say that the body ceases while the mind is eternal in
contradiction to this true principle? You must further realize that life and
death itself is nirvana. We cannot talk about nirvana without life and death.
It is wrong to think that the view that "the mind becomes eternal when it is
free from the body" is the Buddha’s wisdom that is free from life and death,
when the mind that thinks this is itself arising and ceasing and is not
eternal. Could this be relied upon? Understand thoroughly that the
singleness of body and mind is always upheld in the Buddha Dharma. And
so, how could the mind go off from the body to be eternal when the body
arises and perishes? If you say that body and mind are sometimes one and
sometimes not, this would mean you are saying that the Buddha's words are
false. To think that birth and death can be avoided is guilty of despising the
Buddha Dharma. Caution is needed here.
The Buddha Dharma, especially the Lineage that speaks of "the
Dharma Gate of the totality of the nature of Awareness as the vast array"
of the total world of events and experiences does not divide suchness from
appearance, nor arising from vanishing. Even bodhi and nirvana are
nothing but this nature of Awareness. All things and appearances without
exception are totally and only this single Awareness and are embraced
without disarray. The various Dharma Gates are all equally this single
Awareness. This is how the nature of mind is understood in the Buddha
Dharma. How can you divide this into body and mind or life and death from
nirvana? You are already a child of the Buddha so do not listen to madmen
who preach views that are skewed outside of the Way.

Geshe Sonam's uncle was thrown in jail for 6 months due to too many calls coming to his cellphone from India. There was no charge laid, no trial, he was just sent to jail.

Geshe la's cousin endured similar treatment for sending back and forth photos of HH Dalai Lama on Wechat.

I really wonder how you don't hear this information considering it is widely known in the HP Tibetan community.

Indrajala said:
I agree it is morally wrong to arbitrarily imprison people, but do you think responding to such treatment with aggressive protesting or passive-aggressive resistance will make the Chinese authorities change their ways when there is negligible international pressure for them to stop?

Malcolm wrote:
That is why people who live outside of Tibet must continue to voice their opposition to atrocities committed by the PRC against Tibetans. If people are silent, the Chinese will merely take this as assent. This is why HH Dalai Lama is so important, he is living testament to the 55 years of utter brutality to which Tibetans have subjected in their own land.

Or would you like more proof of Chinese oppression of Tibetan people, Jeff? Because really, there is bucket loads. Far more examples of Chinese authorities beating, torturing, raping and killing Tibetans than there is of sexual abuse in Tibetan monasteries in India.

How can a preceding moment act as a support and organ for mental consciousness?

The preceding moment of consciousness, i.e. the mental organ (manendriya) acts as the support for consciousness the same way that a son becomes the father of another; a fruit, the seed of another.

Surely there must be some underlying continuity?

Malcolm wrote:
No substrate is necessary, according to Madhyamakas. The Yogacara sūtras propose the ālayavijñāna to account for memory, continuity and so on.

Andrew108 said:
Also how can memories be recalled if the preceding moment acting as support is no longer present?

Malcolm wrote:
Candrakirti weighs in:

"The consciousness of the memory is not different than the consciousness (experiencing the object) by which an object is experienced, as has already been explained. Why? Because the memory isn't a different thing. Since there was an experience, the memory arises with the object since the consciousness recalling that experience is not different than the experience. Since whatever is encompassed by the consciousness of the experience is encompassed by the consciousness of the memory, it is said "I saw". This is also a worldly convention and is not something to examine, since it is worldly convention of those who possess deluded objects."

Andrew108 said:
How is it that we can hold thoughts and experience connectedness between moments if the preceding consciousness is always changing?

Actually, I just express myself in a way that was not clear what I meant, but this debate was positive, because I learned how to express myself better. I do not believe that karma is just a Buddhist or a Hindu theory, all religions and materialistic philosophies speak of causality somehow. Buddhist philosophy explains karma in order to help people to achieve enlightenment, then it seems to me to be something dangerous to use karma in other context.

Malcolm wrote:
Buddha used karma to explain why some people are born rich, others poor, why some are famous, others not, why some are healthy, others ill, and so on. The point of teaching about karma is that afflictions cause karma, all karma, even positive karma, is rooted in affliction -- which is why positive karma, aka, merit, is exhaustible (unless it is dedicated with a dedication free from the three wheels).

Of course Buddhism is a tradition of reason. We do not accept things merely on blind faith. On the other hand, we also accept śabda pramāṇa, which mean that once we have accepted the Buddha as an authority, we now can accept what he says in the sūtras as being true. Prior to accepting the Buddha actually shows the way to nirvana, of course one can be skeptical.

To add to what I said about the vision of Mahayana about karma, the ideas of Yogacara school, if understood correctly, expression well as karma works from the individual point of view...

Malcolm wrote:
Khenpo Palden Sherab was an awesome lama, someone for whom I have great respect, but nothing you are saying is really brand new to me. Each teaching has its specific context. You cannot expect people who are not Vajrayāna practitioners, for example, to cultivate pure vision in the Vajrayāna sense of the word because they have not been ripened by empowerment nor granted liberating instructions.

Karma is always taught subsequent to dependent origination, for while dependent origination explains the how and why of being reborn; karma explains the what and where of being reborn.

It is fine to say this is all an illusion, a mirage, its unreal, and so on. But it is also necessary to recognize, such as you do, then we need to deal with all these unreal conditions like illness, floods, death, meals, sleeping, waking and so on, and we have to bear in mind that we generally deal with them, 99.999 percent of the time as if they are real. For example, if you are shot, you not sit on your cushion reciting mantras, telling yourself that it is all unreal and it will go away. Not only does one's own karmic traces have the ability to generate appearances for oneself, but also the karmic traces of others can do so as well, as Shabkar points out in Flight of the Garuda. Given this situation, we have to be practical and understand and remind ourselves that having a profound view and realizing it are totally different.

Consciousness is one of the four non-material aggregates. It is the knower and perceiver of objects. The six consciousness are supported on the their respective sense organs; five are supported upon their respective material organ, the eye and so on; the sixth consciousness is supported on its organ, the mental organ, which is in fact the immediately antecedent consciousness. This also accounts for rebirth, why, when this body breaks up, the series of consciousness can appropriate a new series of aggregates through one of the four modes of birth.

What you have come to discover is that you fundamentally do not agree with the Buddha's own teachings on liberation, the purpose of liberation and the results of liberation, in toto.

I don't regard the Buddha as a special witness because there are contradictions in what he is reported to have said. Also there are historical/cultural reasons why he might have said what he said.

Malcolm wrote:
Hogwash. This is your weak argument. The Buddha's essential message is entirely consistent through Mainstream Buddhism, Mahāyāna and all Vajrayāna teachings including Dzogchen. Beings take continual rebirth samsara, dying here, reappearing there for as long as they are under the control of the three afflictions produced by self-grasping. When that self-grasping is eradicated, beings stop taking birth in beginningless samsara. Dependent origination exists solely for the purpose of explaining that process and how to end that process. It is not, as it is commonly misapplied today, to be taken as a general commentary on external phenomena such as the formation of galaxies and so on, though it can of course be applied to such external phenomena as well. The primary reason Buddha taught dependent origination was so that people would stop asking him who they were in past lives. So his reply is fundamentally: our origin is rooted in affliction, which is the cause of karma, and karma is the cause of suffering. When we remove those afflictions, we cease creating karmas, the cause of suffering. This process occurs for living beings from beginningless time.  All valid Buddhist traditions accept this. This is the Dharma of the Buddha we are taking refuge in. If someone does not accept this, they are not really taking refuge in the Dharma, I am sorry to say.

Andrew108 said:

Andrew108 said:
Then inference based on logic. Well according to you I don't really need that because it's enough to take the words of the Buddha as gospel. And if I don't then I'm not Buddhist. The logic you have put forward I regard as being weak. It's such weak logic that the only thing you can do is say that I have to base my conviction on what the Buddha is said to have said.

Actually what I said was that the phenomena under discussion, rebirth, liberation and so on cannot be verified by the perceptions of ordinary persons, such as scientists engaged in empirical research.

Buddha addresses this issue in the Eastern Gatehouse Sūtta I previously cited above.

You might also read the Gendun Chopel book that Lopez published. In it there are some interesting passages regarding appeal to authority.

Of course it does. The most interesting one is that he points out that in the end, one is the only authority for oneself. But the promise of Buddhadharma is that if you bother to do the work, instead of relying on intellectual reason, as you do, you will personally verify the claims the Buddha has made about rebirth, liberation, etc. As for myself, I have verified enough of the claims of the Buddha and the awakened masters that have followed, including our mutual guru, ChNN, to have confidence in the other claims put forward by the tradition.

Look, if you wish to hammer out your own doctrine with logic and reason, be my guest. But don't conflate it with Siddhartha's intent.

This kind of thing can happen even in a very traditinal setting. I feel by me sharing this I am able to let a bit off my chest so to speak, since I was in the retreat. As well just put it out there that a long term retreat is a serious decesion and when entering one you really have to be a very stable person all ready ( that should be obvious but it shocking how it is not )

...

These things need serious reflection before entering. They need concerned, compassionat, caring helpers and assistants along the way. And they need reality checks when things flare up. Maybe for at least the lay practioners a mental health screening would have been helpful in my situation! There is so much shit that comes up being alone with one self, as Malcom pointed out with the axe example!

Reintegrating after that much time is diffiuclt. Reinegrating after psychological dissapointments is even more challenging. Not letting your “spiritual” world get complely crushed and being able to maintain the veiw though out insance circumstances is greater still.

Anyhow, sorry if there was not much point in all that, I just wanted to share and say it can happen anywhere, even in a seemingly perfect traditional situation.

Malcolm wrote:
Sharp weapons are generally not permitted within a retreat precinct because things like the following happen: when my teacher, Ngagpa Yeshe Dorje, was nearly done with his first three year retreat, he had what is called a "chod nyams", a chod experience where he saw his leg as a huge side of meat. So he took a knife he had brought with him into the retreat, and cut a huge chunk of his leg out for his ganapuja. The next morning his attendant found him lying in a pool of blood, nearly dead. His retreat master told him that he could not leave, but anyhow they brought a doctor, patched up his leg, and he remained in the retreat. Now, you have to understand that the Throma retreat manual specifically forbids bringing anything sharp with you into the retreat.

My point is that retreats are serious business and a lot of things can go wrong, and do go wrong. Luckily my experience was pretty peaceful, but then I did my retreat alone without companions, so it was not complicated by the presence of others.

I don't think any knowledgable person here imagines that what happened at DM is impossible in other situations. I remember hearing that in one three year retreat in the US, a very disturbed woman tried to burn down the house the the retreat was being held in, back in the '80's.

Buddhist logic only works if you accept the parameters of Buddhist logic. I think you need to study Dignaga and Dharmakirti a little more thoroughly before you can say you were using "Buddhist" logic to question a Buddhist tenet.

So what are the parameters of Buddhist logic, or "pramāṇa"? They are that there are three valid forms of authority: direct perception, inference, and testimony of special witnesses, such as the Buddha.

Dharmakirti's entire project is to prove that Buddha is a special witness, without recourse to sūtras and so on. If one can show that indeed the Buddha is a special witness, then it follows that one can heed what the Buddha says without reservation. You should get Jackson's book "Is Enlightenment Possible" which deals with this very issue, and includes a logical defense of rebirth.

As far as I can tell, you do not regard the Buddha as a special witness, and consider him to be an ordinary man, just like anyone else.
