As for Huineng, it wasn't given much weight anywhere - as far as I am aware -, probably because it is a short discussion between him and an advocate of the Nirvana Sutra. The exception is Dogen, who used that bit to turn it into an attack on a prevalent interpretation of buddha-mind. While it was Dogen who made that interpretation one of the main elements of his teachings, as he shows by a number of quotations, the common reification of buddha-nature has been pointed out by teachers before him as well. More on Dogen's buddha-nature interpretation: Soto Zen glossary, Norman Fischer article, Takashi James Kodera essay, Joan Stambaugh study.
Mipham states:
As I see it, the dual qualities of emptiness-awareness can be applied perfectly well to the five aggregates, in the sense that they are without essence, and at the same time exist as experiences. But assuming that there is something beyond, an eternal knower, is just a self-view.

Malcolm wrote:
You have not grasped the point. The notion of conditioned/unconditioned depend on reification. They depend on the notion of time and entities being real.

When you insist that emptiness is only the emptiness of dependently origination things, this is wrong on two counts. Dependent origination was never taught to explain the nature of things. It was taught only explain the process of delusion and how to reverse it. Second, there are no "things" for which dependent origination is the nature.

Since the conditioned is not established, it goes without saying that the unconditioned is not established.

However, since the eight consciousness are strictly deluded, there can be no buddhahood in them. Since pristine consciousness is free from conditions, time, entities, concepts and so on, only in it can buddhahood be found. When it is said that self-originated pristine consciousness is unconditioned and beyond the eight consciousness, this means that one has realized that there is also no basis for dependent origination nor the conditioned, not to mention the unconditioned. The real meaning of dependent origination is nonorigination. There can be no time, conditions, causes, etc., in a real sense. This is why there is no buddhahood in the mind because the mind [citta] is always conceptual, always bound causes, conditions, time, etc.

Therefore, the original mind is dharmatā emptiness, the luminous mind that does not become solely empty by nature or an inert emptiness and is called self-originated pristine consciousness. Since there isn’t an iota of a characteristic of conditioned or unconditioned apart from being intrinsically clear emptiness, it [original mind] is beyond the inert composed of particles, clarity which possesses subject and object, and a knowing consciousness. It is to be realized with personal knowledge that sees the true state. It has no correlation with the group of eight consciousnesses. Since the apprehending subject and apprehended objects of concepts and signs have never existed in the dharmatā of the union of knowing and emptiness, the signs of dualistic phenomena such as samsara and nirvana, delusion and liberation, self and other, beginning and end, and so on, have never existed in it since it naturally abide in uniform nonconceptuality.

Mental discernment (manovijñāpti) is the reason for discerning that the eye and so forth encounter phenomena. The discernment of mental consciousness possesses a view. Mental consciousness is conceptual because discernment generates all appearances.
The problem is, that aside from the five sense organ consciousness, all the three others can be described as conceptual consciousnesses, which still makes your presentation from Living Yogacara illsuited. The Mahāyānasamgraha states:
The the concept of the foundation is the all-basis consciousness.
Vasubandhu expands on this slightly:
Since the fundamental concept is "imputation," it is defined as the foundation of concepts, that is also the all-basis consciousness.

I didn't mention it. The sūtras maintain this is so. They also maintain that dharmakāya is jñāna. Draw your own conclusions.

Astus said:
Unconditioned knowing is not possible, unless one accepts a soul. So, the meaning is something else.
Mano-vijn̄āna is a nonconceptual consciousness, like the other five sense consciousnesses.
The mano-vijnana is the thinking mind, the one with all the thoughts and ideas, i.e. concepts. It is also the one that becomes discerning wisdom (pratyavekṣaṇājñāna / 妙觀察智). So, what you seem to be saying is that conceptuality is non-conceptual. Manas only adds the grasping at self, and a number of basic defilements.

The first mind as subjective transformer is the ālaya-vijñāna. The ālayavijñāna flawlessly retains all of our past experiences, and recognizes and contextualizes things as we cognize them. our experiences, according to their depth and significance upon our lives, are difficult to remove.
The second subjective transformer is the manas. in this case, objects of cognition are transformed by a deep attachment to the self, and the resulting tendencies to protect and further that self.
Then, already subject to these subconscious influences, the cognitive function of the thinking consciousness and the five sense consciousnesses—that is, the discrimination of things — arises.

PTSD, etc., this is a completely different issue. But here we are talking about neurological damage to nerve pathways caused by excess stress in combat, accidents, repeated abuse, and while it is the case that we see that kind of damage from cocaine, methamphetamine, and so on, so far no one has ever demonstrated any neurological damage resulting from using LSD, Psilocybin, Mescaline, DMT, etc. Part of the problem of course is that no one is allowed to do research on these compounds in any systematic way.

Another way it is put is that all kāyās at the time of the basis (before any realization occurs at all) are the dharmakāya. All kāyas at the time of the path are sambhogakāya. All kāyas at the time of the result are the nirmanakāya.

Mapping the three kāyas to the clarity and emptiness of the mind, as I pointed out already, is from the point of view of the explaining the basis of the three kāyas, not their realization. We can say that emptiness corresponds to dharmakāya because dharmakāya is the the ultimate realization of the nature of reality. We can say that clarity corresponds to the sambhogakāya because clarity is evident and distinct and the sambhogakāya emerges as a visible result, and so on. There are many ways to parse these things. But parsing things in this way does not mean that the emptiness of one's mind is the resultant dharmakāya, such arguments destroy the path. Why, because the basis has not been realized in a proper way and that basis and the result are confused.

'The Dharmakaya, though manifesting itself in the triple world (past, present, and future), is free from impurities and desires. It unfolds itself here, there, and everywhere, responding to the call of karma. It is not an individual reality, it is not a false existence, but is universal and pure. It comes from nowhere, it goes to nowhere; it does not assert itself, nor is it subject to annihilation. It is forever serene and eternal. It is the One, devoid of all determinations. This Body of Dharma has no boundary, no quarters, but is embodied in all bodies. Its freedom or spontaneity is incomprehensible, its spiritual presence in things corporeal is incomprehensible. All forms of corporeality are involved therein; it is able to create all things. Assuming any concrete material body as required by the nature and condition of karma, it illuminates all creations. Though it is the treasure of intelligence it is void of particularity. There is no place in the universe where this Body does not prevail. The universe becomes, but this Body forever remains. It is free from all opposites and contraries, yet it is working in all things to lead them to Nirvana.'

Astus said:
Then you have to change the roles given to sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya as the functional aspects. Because where dharmakaya refers to emptiness, the three bodies together make up a complete buddha-mind, and they do not exist separately.

Malcolm wrote:
No, you don't have to change anything. It is very clear that sūtra states dharmakāya is the jñāna of a buddha.

Astus said:
Kanthā. It means anything that lacks a mind.
Interesting. In the dictionaries online it translates to "rag, patched garment; wall, town". But if it means anything mindless, how is it specifically for rocks?

Malcolm wrote:
If it is for everything, it is also for rocks.

Astus said:
That is how it is parsed in some Vajrayāna contexts,  but never in sūtra, where it is generally treated as synonym of dharmakāya.
Maybe in TB, but have not encountered with it in EAB. But their unity is known:

"The dharmakāya, saṃbhogakāya, and nirmāṇakāya—
The three bodies are fundamentally a single body.
If one can see it oneself within the nature,
This is the cause of bodhi and the achievement of buddhahood."
(Platform Sutra, ch 10, BDK Edition, p 90)

Malcolm wrote:
The three kāyas are inseparable, just as your body, speech and mind are inseparable. Three aspects, one entity.

Astus said:
"The concluding practice is the conviction that the ordinary mind that was from the beginning the unity of clarity and emptiness is itself the naturally arising three kayas - its emptiness is dharmakaya, its clarity is nirmanakaya, and the union of those is sambhogakaya."

(Jamgon Kongtrul on Mahamudra of the Shangpa Kagyu, in The Treasury of Knowledge: Book Eight, Part Four: Esoteric Instructions, p 246).....

Malcolm wrote:
You can parse it like this, and this is very characteristic of the new tantra schools, where dharmakāya is related to the emptiness aspect of the nature of the mind, but that is not the real dharmakāya. As we already saw dharmakāya = jñānakāya.

The Śrī Māladevi Sūtra states:
The dharmakāya of the tathāgatas is space-like pristine consciousness, the kāya of the pristine consciousness of the tathāgatas.
Vasubandhu's commentary on the Dasabhumi Sūtra states very clearly:
With respect to that, the first deliverance is the dharmakāya that exists only through pristine consciousness, devoid of mind, intellect, or consciousness. Why? Because dharmakāya is the kāya of pristine consciousness.
The Amnāyamañjarī, a commentary on the Saṃputa Tantra states:
The kāya of pristine consciousness is the dharmakāya.
The Vimalaprabha, commentary on Kālacakra states:
The omniscient kāya of pristine consciousness is is the innate nature of the victors and is likewise the dharmakāya.
The Great Tantra Clarifying The Meaning of Freedom From Proliferation states:
Since there are no causes and conditions in the dharmakāya, 
self-originated pristine consciousness, it is not conditioned.
The Tantra of the Dimension Of Samantabhadra’s Pristine Consciousness, The Most Refined Gold states:
The buddhas of the three times are free from mind [sems]. 
Since they lack the group of eight consciousnesses, they also lack the mind. 
The self-originated essence, dharmakāya,
is the pristine consciousness that does not arise from mind.
Mipham says about this:
It must be understood that pristine consciousness does not arise from the mind because the reality of the mind is natural luminosity, just as emptiness, the dharmatā of all entities, is the reality of entities but does not arise from entities.
Furthermore, the Tantra of the View of the Great Perfection, Perfect Deep Pristine Consciousness states:
Since this self-originated essence that has always existed
was not produced from a cause nor generated by a condition,
be confident that the self-originated pristine consciousness
is the dharmakāya that was not fabricated through any sort of effort.
Mipham futher states:
However, that dharmakāya, the original knowing and empty pristine consciousness, does not need to be based on methods with characteristics such as the cessation the vāyu in the central channel and so on. [20/a] If there is no contraction between the empowerment that transfers the blessings of the guru and our own path of the Great Perfection’s introduction of the mind essence as the dharmakāya that actualizes the transcendent state (dgongs pa) of the nonarising original purity of one’s own mind, the pristine consciousness that resembles that is the meaning pristine consciousness indicated by the fourth empowerment.

As for as there being more than three bodies of the buddha, that very much depends on whether one considers svabhāvakāya to be a synonym for dharmakāya or not. I am inclined to think it is a synonym.

This does not really square with sūtra:

For example, the commentary of the Lanka states:

So here you definition of dharmakāya = emptiness is inadequate, since it would leave dharmakāya as an inert void.


Astus said:
It seems that Buddhist thinkers did not bother with creating a special word for the insubstantiality of rocks. Note: dharmakaya is just one of the three/four bodies, so it is not all there is to a buddha/mind.

So in order for one to "advance" in meditational practice one has to be "advanced" in meditational practice.  Interesting theory. When you cultivate dhyānas as a normal person, not an ārya, you are doing nothing more nor less than cultivating samsaric paths for rebirth.
If one is not attached to dhyana, then why would this necessarily lead to the cultivation of samsaric paths?

In which case, and please correct me if I am wrong, are you saying that we have to give up meditation practices (and here I include sadhana, mantra, Yidam, etc... all of which are meditation practices) and devote ourselves to Dana while waiting for stream entry to spontaneously manifest?

Malcolm wrote:
You are now changing the scope of the discussion. I was focused specifically on dhyāna.

The practices you describe are bhavana (sgom pa) practices, not specifically the cultivation (sgom) of dhyāna.

Because the pleasures of dhyāna are quite intense, there is a great danger of being distracted by them if one is an ordinary person. And they do create traces for rebirth in the form realms which need to be eradicated later, because their very cultivation is a form of karma. In fact, the main reason why the Buddha went through the eight dhyānas was to eradicate traces he created through meditating them previously. And of course, bliss, clarity and nonconceptuality themselves place one at risk for taking rebirth in one of the three realms, depending upon which one there is attachment for, which is why in Mahāmudra there are extensive remedies for attachment to these three experiences which result in rebirth in the three realms.

Yes, of course. However, there are also other ways the Buddha describes to become an ārya, for example, mindfulness of breathing combined with the four foundations of mindfulness, described famously as the ekayāna, the quick vehicle.

It means that the teachings on the precious human birth are a scam.  That this precious human rebirth is actually NOT a suitable vehicle for liberation, etc...

Upon what should a mind depend? If you assert it must continue based on sense perceptions, than you cannot explain how a mind continues in a completely nonconceptual samadhi, for example, nirvikalpa samadhi (which in a Buddha is called Vajropama Samadhi).
When there is nothing grasped, there is no grasper either. But that means only the lack of substantialisation of object and subject, not that there are no phenomena.
Same only in the sense in the sense that two fires are both hot; different in so far as the two fires are distinct. In other words, I I apprehend the ball in your mind's eye, the image I perceive in my mind will be indentical to how you perceive the ball, but different inso far as our minds are distinct continuums.
Mind is the subjective experience. To make it an object is not any more a subjective experience, therefore not the experience of another's mind, but a concept about what is in another's mind. In other words, you can think that I think about a ball. That happens even when I tell you that I think of a ball, so you know what I think about. Telepathy is knowing what I think without I telling you. But since there is no connection between the minds, what is the cause of knowing it? Without connection it is like seeing a ball that's in another room - there is no light reaching the eyes from the ball, so it cannot be seen.

Since the mind [sems] is adulterated with concepts within the body (an aggregate of assembled elements), the mind is dependent on the body. Thus the possessive particle “can” is used.

When people say that men and women are naturally equal and that inequality is an artificial or socially constructed condition, they are ignoring the fact that the amount of status conferred to individual human beings in a state of nature is determined by fixed (or relatively stable) characteristics related to survival.

When we talk about social equality, what we're really talking about are social controls that can aid in intelligently harnessing our human energies towards forwarding the civilizational endeavor. However, thinking that these controls erase our differences - or forgetting that these differences exist - is foolish and even dangerous, in some cases.

"Equality" does not mean there are no differences among individuals. It simply means that everyone granted the same opportunities and recognized to to have the same rights irrespective of their "race," gender, gender preference, and so on.

In the meantime, while regressive forces such as Boko Haram may be may be acute, they are limited. In general, most people wish to emulate the lifestyle of Europe and North America, our civil liberties and opportunities, unequal though they may be when compared to the global economy as a whole. And for as long as people aspire to emulate our civil liberties and opportunities, they will continue advertise their support for equal rights, democracy and so on., as they do now, no matter how inexpertly or superficially.

This is a question of justice, which should be balanced against other principles of welfare. But the force you are talking about is largely unsolicited and coming from outside of these societies, which is unjust. Take Martin Luther King's hyperbole 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.' This approach has led to skilful change in some countries through embargo (such as South Africa), but only when the unjust group was of little economic value. The hypocrisy is evident when a group continues to enjoy economic benefit with another while being at odds with their principles. So forcefully liberate the Saudi people from their oppressive government if it means so much to you (I don't support this) but don't continue to buy their oil while decrying their iniquity. You need to make honour an implicit requirement for trade. Otherwise it is just your greed that is powering their inequality (not the cause, but the condition. See my previous posts).

Well I didn't mean to say that in order to pit him against you and argue over who's right and wrong. I'm more curious about why exactly it would not be understood as an abbreviation in that usage? He has an explanation of what gsal ba means as an adjective/adverb: "To be evident to the senses.  Although this could be taken as "clear", the term is used in the sense of "obvious", "evident", "distinct", and hence clear to the senses." Which seems to line up with your explanation.

I guess this distinction is more relevant when you're look at an actual instance when translating a text... Maybe not as helpful when just trying to understand the word.

Malcolm wrote:
The sanskrit term underlying gsal ba is vivṛta (and a few other terms that mean the same thing). For example, in one commentary on Hevajra, we find གསལ་བ་ནི་མངོན་པའོ, i.e., "clear" means "evident." A long commentary on Abhidharma states,"Clear means fully knowing, but unclear means it is not clear."

Your mind is empty, because it cannot be established, but it is "clear" because it is distinct.

It is made clear in this text that being male is preferable to being female. This sentiment is not uncommon in the sūtras.

Your argument, "The call to fight for rights does not liberate us from the conditions that deny them to us, it mires us in trying to fix what the sutras have always told us is beyond repair," is morally bankrupt in so far as it suggests that the struggle for human freedom and rights (as well as the freedoms and rights of animals, plants, and all other living things) ought to be abandoned at the outset because it is "samsaric," and from a Mahāyāna point of view, is even more problematical, because it is predicated on the mistaken idea that one should never strive to improve conditions which result in temporary happiness for sentient beings. The Buddha himself never hesitated to to advise rulers to understand the rights of their subjects and their own obligation to defend those rights. In fact, improving the temporary conditions of sentient beings through supporting the struggle for human rights in general, and women's rights specifically, properly falls within the Mahāyāna's four means of conversion (offering protection). Indeed, your reactionary dissent shows that you have utterly failed to understand that Mahāyāna Buddhists should be in the vanguard of the struggle for human and ecological rights precisely because aiding those who are in need of protection and emancipation (and there is no better way to ensure secular protections and emancipation than through social justice predicated on a theory of intrinsic rights) precisely falls within the activity of a bodhisattva, for example, HH Dalai Lama, Bhikku Bodhi, Roshi Glassman, Thich Naht Hahn and many others.

While the seeds of the emancipation of women, the explicit condemnation of slavery and human trafficking, and so on, can all be found in the twelve limbs of the Buddha's teachings, so too can regressive attitudes and practices, such as the patriarchal notion and practice of considering women and children to be the property of husbands and fathers.

Buddhists need to be honest about these patriarchal memes in Buddhist core literature, as well as secondary literature, and understand them, analyze them, and not make wan excuses for their presence in our Dharma traditions. Why? Well, for one, in the West, arguably, the majority of active practitioners of Buddhadharma appear to be women. Buddhadharma must accommodate this situation. To accommodate it, we must recognize that within Buddhadharma sexist and patriarchal culture forms have been preserved and promulgated, which has lead to the disenfranchisement of women. For example, given the literary output of Western women in the past 100 years, one can hardly imagine any other reason there are so few women Buddhist authors in the past 2500 years than the fact that women were systematically barred from higher education and that their gender was the reason they were barred from such educations. The institutionalization of patriarchal norms in Buddhadharma is found right at the beginning of the bhikṣuni sangha, when it was declared that even the most senior bhiḳsunis were required to bow to and sit behind male novices.

The time for this to change has arrived. It is changing, and we should be supportive of these changes. For the first time in history there are women Geshes, thanks to HHDL, and so on. Male dominance in Buddhadharma is coming to an end, as it should, and for the first time in history, women are finding their voices in the Dharma. We should recognize that wholesale suppression of the Dharma voices of human women (as opposed the transvaluation of women's voices as ḍākinīs and so on, something extraordinary as opposed to something ordinary) for the past 2500 is a loss to the Dharma.

DGA just what I see in the news. This was a discussion I did not want to get trapped in.

This topic might be better left to the Azealia Banks and Sarah Palins of this world. Myoho-Nameless you have a very different perspective and that is interesting.

I just try to keep my mind steady so it doesn't get tossed about by this or that. A strong mind is the best ally as the Buddha taught.

Malcolm wrote:
It always astonishes me when people who follow Buddhadharma are unwilling to address on of the chief causes of suffering among human beings, the exploitation of and discrimination against women, and are unwilling to take a hard look at the inequality women have been subjected to in Buddhist countries and how women are portrayed. For example, in the sūtra of the Guru of Medicine, this sentiment is expressed:
When I have attained the the awakening at of actualizing buddhahood in that unsurpassed perfect, complete awakening, any women who are afflicted by the one hundred faults of womanhood, who decry the state of womanhood, who wish to be completely liberated from birthplaces of women, they will turn away from the state of womanhood, and until they have attained the state of awakening will be born with a male gender.
One can read this charitably, and understand that it is so awful being a woman in this world, one would want to be born somewhere where there is no gender. Often, this is how teachers try to gloss this passage. However, in the sūtra, no mention is made of the one hundred faults, or even single fault of being a male. It is made clear in this text that being male is preferable to being female. This sentiment is not uncommon in the sūtras. And we very often find women in Buddhist literature referring to themselves as being of inferior births because they are women.

People should think long and hard about these things, and not dismiss concern such imagery as being of no consequence.

The only religious fanatacism here is the one that would seek to defend what is indefensible, i.e., treating women and children as property which can be given away.

This story is part of the Vessantara Jataka, as Sapan says:

There is nothing blameworthy in giving up one's wife and family, per se. But giving them up as slaves to a brahmin in order to perfect generosity could only be seen as laudable in an extremely patriarchal civilization where women and children have no legal status as holders of personal rights.

The story illustrates that in highly venerated Indian Buddhist Sūtras, a man's family was considered his chattel, to be disposed of as he wished, however he wished.

It is one of the most famous of all the Jatakas, carved into the walls of Angkor Wat.

It is nevertheless sited within Himalayan patriarchal culture, and his attitude towards women, and that of 15th century Bhutanese men in general, leaves much to be desired from a modern perspective, much as, from a feminist perspective, Buddhism as a whole is rife with sexism. If you are not a woman, you might not be aware of how much the sexism in Buddhism is hurtful to our sisters, mothers, and daughters.

To stay as we are would mean being lost in the concepts of gain and loss. Seeing that all is empty means that there is nothing that can be grasped. When there is nothing to be grasped, there is no attachment, and without attachment there is no suffering. But nothing to grasp doesn't mean total blankness, it means that all experiences constantly change, hence nothing to rely on. That is the non-abiding mind, but not simply mindlessness.
Realisation pertains to the nature of reality, or to the 'nature of all experience' if you like. As I understand it, that is why realisation is for keeps, it doesn't come and go
The realisation is the realisation of all being in a flux. It is giving up the mistaken idea of permanence, and one that misconception is completely removed, there is no view attached to, and that lack of grasping doesn't come and go.

“Ultimate and relative” are also just emphatic labels,

Mahāsiddha Kotalipa also adds his voice:
Inanimate and animate phenomena
abide as appearances because there is no duality;
they are naturally pure,
peace, space, and immaculate.

Nonduality is a merely a name,
even that name will not exist;
sensation and one who senses are free from signs,
nonduality is great bliss.

Liberated from all concepts,
without the dualism of duality, supreme peace,
like space, liberated from conceptuality,
that is called nondual, 

the meditation on the appearances of all phenomena
with the yoga of abiding in the inconceivable.
And:
whether I become a Buddha
or not and go to hell,
hell itself blissful.

there is no such thing as a "collection of stars" independently, so in order for such to appear, there must first be a conceptual act aka imputation. If you directly perceive things that you do not impute, they must exist independent of imputation. You are claiming that thing exist as more than mere name. This is not the first time your realist slip has peeked out from under your madhyamika skirt.

Malcolm wrote:
According to the world, external objects exist independent of our imputations, things such as pots, pillars, and so on, forming the basis of our imputations.

These "facts" as not my point of view, these "facts" are facts known to the world at large. Try explaining to Joe the Plumber that his truck is merely his imputation and enjoy the blank uncomprehending stare you will receive in return.

What I find so strange is why a so called "prasangika" spends so much time on a species of mind-only theory. A proper Prasangika just accepts at face value what the world accepts. Certainly Candrakirtī never makes the distinction you are trying to make, and never would assert that direct perceptions are a result of imputations. For example, he states in his commentary to the MAV:
The wisdom that knows all aspects
is asserted to have the characteristic of a direct perception.

And in the Prasannapāda, he clearly accepts the conventions around direct perceptions and inferences.

Herbie said:
i would not say "impossible" but that it is the only way the expression "direct perception" could make sense: you can directly perceive objects only because you are familiar with the conceptual imputations of them. And "you are familiar" means that you are conditioned appropriately before you "directly perceive". So it boils down to the dichotomy of " inherently direct vs. inherently conceptual" being completely inappropriate.

Malcolm wrote:
No, Herbie, direct perceptions are by definition non conceptual. In other words, a direct perception happens when a sense organ and object and a moment of consciousness come together: for example, when an eye consciousness apprehends a blue object before any labeling of the object as blue occurs.

The essay by the Dalai Lama says:
As to the question of whether or not a single mental state can observe and examine itself, this has been a very important and difficult question in the Buddhist science of mind. Some Buddhist thinkers have maintained that there is a faculty of mind called "self- consciousness," or "self-awareness." It could be said that this is an apperceptive faculty of mind, one that can observe itself. But this contention has been disputed. Those who maintain that such an apperceptive faculty exists distinguish two aspects within the mental, or cognitive, event. One of these is external and object-oriented in the sense that there is a duality of subject and object, while the other is introspective in nature and it is this that enables the mind to observe itself. The existence of this apperceptive self-cognizing faculty of mind has been disputed, especially by the later Buddhist philosophical school of thought the Prasangika.

Not going to argue with you about it. But it is as I have said. All appearances are empty. Some appearances arise from karma, some do not. In Dzogchen teachings, we work with the latter, including the sound of dharmatā, which is just a "sound" that arises from your own state, for example, the sound and sights that you hear and see in the bardo of dharmatā.

There is no organized curriculum, by any NIchiren groups AFAIK, that can provide an accessible and practical approach starting with basics through the higher levels of practice. Japan was so unstable in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries and the Nichiren community immediately after Nichiren's passing more or less struggled. Nichiren's description of the Daimoku as an amulet tied around our necks really bore out. Through those centuries of turmoil, little survived except the Daimoku. We certainly lost the curriculum Nichiren taught which appears to have been heavily loaded with study of Zhiyi, Zhanran and Saicho, and without that foundation, I don't think you can really understand him.

At this point, the curriculum needs to be reconstructed. I don't see anyone in a position to do that. SGI is stuck and lost without Ikeda. Shoshu has gone back to being their closed off sect. Nichiren Shu, while pleasant and open does not seem to have the inspiration, content to be the managers of historic temples. To the extent that they've innovated practices, it seems to be in the direction of Japanese style asceticism. Everyone else seems like they are sleep walking through the performance of the traditional rites.

Just one question: You are aware probably, that such logic is not valid reasoning according to Western philosophical standards, right? In Western thought you of course cannot conclude from the premise "...did not exist..." to "...would not be any different than physical matter...". According to Western thought, if something did not exist, then it could not be either different or same as anything else that does exist. (Whether a non-existent thing is same or different from another non-existent thing is an open question.)

Malcolm wrote:
The passage means that if the basis isn't a consciousness, it would be inert, like the four elements.

What is the basis? Garab Dorje states in a commentary in the Vima Snying thig:
"The fundamental basis is the trio of essence, nature and compassion of each individual's vidyā."
We saw already that essence, nature and compassion are aspects of what is termed "pristine consciousness" aka ye shes or primordial wisdom.

I also want to point out, that though it may seem to some people that Dzogchen is proposing some temporal beginning to samsara and nirvana, this is really not the case. Dzogchen is not a cosmology. It is a phenomenology of bondage and liberation.

Dante, the term "basis" describes a state of nonrealization, nothing more.

We use the term to describe a set of qualities of what is termed "pristine consciousness." The basis is a consciousness, term "pristine consciousness, as the Six Dimensions states:
Because pristine consciousness has three aspects, 
the basis is explained in different words.
The Sgra thal gyur states:
The pristine consciousness dwelling in its own essence
is inseparable in three modalities.
Further, the Illuminating Lamp commentary on Sgra thal gyur states
the pristine consciousness—subsumed by the consciousness which apprehends primordial liberation and the abiding basis as ultimate—is inseparable in all buddhas and sentient beings as a mere consciousness.
A rock in a garden is just a projection of a mind that does not recognize its own state. This is very explicitly stated of inanimate objects — they are reified out of the five lights from our nonrecognition of the five lights. For example, the Illuminating Lamp states:
The luminous aspect of delusion resulting from that is stirred by a subtle vāyu. Also, all the previous lights are stirred and obscured, such that the light’s own appearance grows dimmer and dimmer. After it becomes impure, the latent appearances of earth, water, fire, and air emerge and appear as subtle particles.

apart from this, nothing else was taught by the victors.

The sentient beings inhabiting it appearing in six classes are also the mind.
The appearance of the happiness of the higher realms of gods and men is the mind.
The appearance of the suffering of the three lower realms is also the mind.
Avidyā appearing as the five poisons is also the mind.
Vidyā appearing as self-originated pristine consciousness is also the mind. [106]
Negative thoughts appearing as the traces of samsara are also the mind.
Positive thoughts appearing as buddhafields are also the mind.
The appearance of obstacles of ghosts and demons is also the mind.
The appearances of gods and siddhis are also the mind.
The appearances of the variety of concepts are also the mind.
Non-conceptuality, appearing as one-pointed meditation, is also the mind.
The signs and colors of things are also the mind.
The absence of signs and non-existence of proliferation is also the mind.
Appearances without the duality of being one or many is also the mind.
Appearances that are not established as being either existent or non-existent are also the mind.
There are no appearances at all apart from the mind.

yet he also says that through the experience of emptiness and clarity one may discover instant presence/rigpa.

Malcolm wrote:
The universe does not exist outside the minds that project it, and there is no inseparable clarity and emptiness for us to discover apart from the inseparable clarity and emptiness of our own minds. The fact that we can discover the knowledge of our own state through the three experiences proves that we are discovering the knowledge of the real state of our own minds, and nothing else. As far as the reality of the universe goes, well as Āryadeva put it, when one discovers the emptiness of one thing, one discovers the emptiness of all things, and as the Dzogchen tantras put it, knowing one thing liberates everything ( gcig shes kun grol ).

You should should also bear in mind that the experience of clarity, which is connected with lhun grub, is just an example, the same goes with the experience of emptiness, it is merely an example. This is why, for example, we don't attain the first bhumi at direct introduction (99.999 percent of us at any rate) —— that only happens if one happens to be diligent enough to reach the third vision in this life.

so what you are saying is that when someone perceives emptiness and enters the first buhmi, they are not perceiving emptiness, just non-conceptuality?[/quote]

What I am saying is that the the term "experience of emptiness" refers to an experience of nonconceptuality, where one's mind seems empty of thoughts and concepts (actually there is still a very subtle stream of thoughts and concepts). It is not the same thing as realizing emptiness, a point which ChNN (since he seems to be the only authority you accept) has made repeatedly over the years.

Likewise, "the experience of clarity," as opposed to the clarity aspect of the nature of mind, refers to a heightened sense of awareness, where, as ChNN notes, Longchenpa describes being aware of things even though they are outside of his immediate audiovisual range, such as features of the mountains behind him and so on.

The experience of bliss, obviously, does not refer to the bliss of awakening, but rather pleasurable sensations, for example, during sexual intercourse.

As to your first question, these are indeed karmic appearances.

As to your second question, a buddha perceives only a display of pristine consciousness, so pristine consciousness or primordial wisdom is what is "actually" there once the delusion ceases.

This is old argument in Tibetan circles. What Tsongkhapa actually argues is that the posited liquid substance  is validly divisible into six portions: molten iron, pus and blood, water as an environment, water as water, and water as nectar over which asuras and devas squabble, thus rendering all perception conventionally valid, not only in their own domain, but generally so.

those who are interested in the Ati Dzogpa Chenpo teaching and follow its principle must first of all train earnestly in separating nature of the mind, or instant presence, from mind. The principal reason for the need for this separation is to avoid the deviation and error that can occur when most practitioners apply the practice on the path, i.e. that of mistaking experiences such as emptiness or clarity for our real nature.
So: our real nature is beyond emptiness and clarity. That is the basis, and direct knowledge of that is rigpa.

The basis, as we saw above, is just the dharmatā of one's own mind, just as heat is the dharmatā of fire. We don't say of emptiness for example, that there multiple emptinesses for multiple entities, we don't need to say that of the basis either when we understand that the basis is a generic set of attributes for all minds, just as emptiness is a generic attribute of phenomena. We speak of emptiness often without distinguishing whether we mean one emptiness or many emptinesses, because it is understood at the outset that there is no entity "emptiness" that needs to spoken of in plural or singular terms. Likewise, we don't need to speak about the basis in plural or singular terms because we can understand at the outset the term "basis" refers to the dharmatā of the mind, and not some entity out of which minds arise, or in which they are somehow located. Likewise, we discuss fire in terms of heat, we don't say that fires have heats, we merely generically declare that all fires are hot.

Since the ultimate pervades them without any nature at all, it is contained within each individual consciousness.
this is very different from saying, as you do, that the ultimate is each individual consciousness

Malcolm wrote:
I never said that each individual consciousness was ultimate per se. The point is that the ultimate (inseparable luminosity and emptiness) is a generic attribute they all share, in the same way all fires share the generic attribute of heat, and so on, or that each and every entity is empty. As Candra points, all things have two natures, one relative, one ultimate. In Madhyamaka, the ultimate nature of each and everything is emptiness. This is true also in Dzogchen; but in Dzogchen, not only are all minds ultimately empty, they are also ultimately luminous. This inseparable luminosity and emptiness is given the name "one's unfabricated mind" by Vimalamitra, or as Mipham puts it:
That basis is originally pure from the aspect of lacking any proliferation, and since it is not solely empty like space, its impartial clarity is naturally perfect without being delimited or falling into extremes. Since it is the source of the appearances of all samsara and nirvana, compassion is said to pervade everything. In the Dharma terminology of the Great Perfection, the pristine consciousness that is said to be three-fold. 

Likewise, in the sūtras and tantras,  it called “the dhātu” and “emptiness” from the aspect of the characteristic freedom from all kinds of proliferation that cannot be perceived at all. [4/a] From the aspect of intrinsically radiant (mdangs) clarity it is called “self-originated pristine consciousness.” Since it does not change in aspect, it is called “original mind (sems),” “original mind (yid),” “naturally luminous mind,” “the vajra of mind,” “the vajra of space that pervades space” and so on. Even though there is an explanation with many different names, all of them are not different in meaning than dharmatā of the mind, the nondual dhātu and vidyā, or bodhicitta, the ultimate reality is like a vajra.
 
Therefore, since the so called “dharmadhātu” is not understood to be only empty, it is the emptiness that possesses the supreme of all aspects, whole and indivisible from luminosity. Though it is called “self-originated pristine consciousness,” the subjective mind that realizes the emptiness of the duality, and of subject and object, does not know conditioned signs. It is also necessary to understand that such natural clarity does not have an iota of a sign that can be designated as conditioned.

The bodhicitta mentioned in the mind series of the Great Perfection, the dharmadhātu mentioned in the space series, the self-originated pristine consciousness mentioned in the intimate instruction series, the dharmadhātu mentioned in the Prajñāpāramitā, the original mind mentioned in most of the mantra tantras and so on may have different names by virtue of their purposes, but since the meaning to understand is the pristine consciousness of that meaning which illustrates the union of knowing and emptiness, the reality of all phenomena, it is the original connate pristine consciousness. Since it is naturally settled dharmatā because it is not generated by the traces of transmigration’s three appearances, it is called the great bliss that is free from all pain of transmigration.

all you need to do is remove the  "of the mind" from this sentence, and it will be basically correct, although clearer would be "seeing the display as the display of the basis is called rigpa", with the understanding that, as ChNNR says, "the universal level, and the level of the individual, the two being essentially the same. If you realize yourself, you realize the nature of the universe"

Malcolm wrote:
There is no need to remove "mind" from the sentence, since rig pa is knowledge that a mind has, apart from which, no rig pa is possible. This is the reason why prajñā and vidyā are synonymous. For example, Vimalamitra in the Vima sNying thig, among the five definitions of vidyā, which are contextual, states first that vidyā is "a clear nonconceptual consciousness contaminated by many consciousnesses." The second type is the vidyā that appropriates the basis (meaning the body) existing in the body, generates consciousness, existing within its own clarity, also termed, "unripened vidyā." The third type of vidyā is the one that exists in the basis, defined as possessing three pristine consciousness of essence, nature and compassion. The fourth is defined as the vidyā of insight, vipaśyāna, having to do with the visions. The fifth is the vidyā of thögal, here meaning vidyā at the conclusion of the fourth vision.

In the end, all five of these are just means of talking about one's own mind and it's knowledge of its own state or lack thereof, since all five of these vidyās, Vimalamitra points, are essentially the same.

The Lotus Sutra more or less says that its fiction if you read between the lines. The parables of the burning house, the rich man and poor son, the phantom city, the good doctor who sends word that he is dead, Shakyamuni who was born at Lumbini, awakened at Gaya, turned the Wheel at Sarnath, and passed at Kusinagara - he says its all upaya.

"mind" is an imputation, a conceptual proliferation. the basis is neither since it is beyond all conceptual categories. seeing this directly is called rigpa.

Malcolm wrote:
No, seeing that the display of the mind as your own state is called "rigpa."

For example, how do "sense organs rise up from the basis" in the following citation from the sgra thal gyur?
since the buddhas did not become deluded,
the sense organs that rose up out of the basis
recognized the self-appearances as natureless
For that matter, how would one account for this citation as well?
In the basis, totally undifferentiated
and undefined,
consciousness is grasped as moving, vanishing,
and spreading out,
and holding taints through accumulation.
Moreover, we here have a citation from the commentary on the sgra thal gyur would adds more understanding:
In Ati, the pristine consciousness—subsumed by the consciousness which apprehends primordial liberation and the abiding basis as ultimate—is inseparable in all buddhas and sentient beings as a mere consciousness. Since the ultimate pervades them without any nature at all, it is contained within each individual consciousness.
Again, the so called generic basis is set of qualities which all consciousnesses share.

Even when we get to defining sems, what does the sgra thal gyur say?
Sems enters the pure and impure
three realms, and also buddhahood.
The basis has an aspect of consciousness, as the Six Dimensions clearly states:
If that aspect of pristine consciousness did not exist, 
it would not be any different than the physical matter of the four elements.
If it were the case that the basis was single entity, there could not be separation of samsara and nirvana. How can delusion be accounted for, which is the whole reason for describing the basis? As Vimalamitra further states:
[D]elusion arises from the difference between the basis and the conscious aspect of the basis.
If the basis is some unitary entity, this conscious aspect would have to be unitary, etc., in the sense that it would there could be no diversity. But when it is understood that the basis is generic set of attributes of every consciousness, there are no contradictions which remain.

In other words, Dzogchen is describing a phenomenology of liberation and delusion, and the language around the so called "basis" is merely a starting point for discussing that which we are deluded about. What we are deluded about is the nature our own states, and apart from a stream of empty consciousness, there is no other state that is under discussion.

so luminosity is not the basis, rather emptiness and luminosity are qualities of the basis, which is itself empty of both those qualities, as well as all others, including existence and non existence.

Malcolm wrote:
The basis is just your mind. Not your thoughts, not its content, etc. It has three qualities, essence, nature, and compassion.

There is no basis apart from your mind, in its unfabricated, unmodified state. If this wasn't the case, your nonrecognition of the five lights would not result in samsara, and your recognition of the five lights would not result in buddhahood. But in any case, it is just your own mind and its characteristics we are discussing. These five lights are just the result of the stirring of vāyu which is the internal movement of your own consciousness prior its self-recognition/nonrecognition.

Now, you don't have to accept the Dzogchen account of the basis and the arising of the basis, and that is just fine with me. But let's not pretend that Dzogchen has some other kind basis in mind than the one I have just described.

From the point of view of the potentiality of the basis, your own consciousness, the basis is luminosity; from the point of the essence of the basis, your own consciousness, the basis is emptiness free from extremes. This emptiness and luminosity are inseparable, and are the essence and nature of your own mind. This is all very clearly explained in Dzogchen texts, I am not sure why you have a problem with this.་

Further, the basis is only called "the basis" because one has not realized this.

It is not really that complicated. We say that minds are empty and luminous. When we analyze a given mind (for example, our own, since we cannot examine the minds of others), all we can discover is emptiness and luminosity. These are the irreducible facts that pertain to minds. The fact that minds are empty means they are free from extremes and not monadic, or even plural entities. The fact that they are luminous means that they are not inert, like rocks, etc. We don't need to discuss these things in terms of the two truths, because there is no separation between the two truths anyway.

of course rocks do not have rigpa (since they are not sentient) but they are appearances of the basis, just like sentient beings are. if the basis is mind (as you said) and rocks appear to mind, then even if they are a mistaken imputation made on the five lights, its still the basis (appearing as your mind) making that imputation.

I think what is confusing to some people is that all appearances are delusions. In other words, appearances are delusions appearing to deluded minds. However, while this is true, it is not the case that all delusions are the same, or at the same degree, which I think is part of Tsongkhapa's point. Mipham for one distinguishes between valid and invalid conventional cognition, and also various levels of pure vision--- accordingly, a human being's vision is more "pure" than a preta's, but still under the influence of delusion.

Put in the simplest terms, all sentient beings possess a consciousness which has the nature being empty and clear. When examined from the point of view of reducing this to the most essential point, the basis is just one's unfabricated mind, nothing more, nothing less.

For example, the Chinese original text where it literally reads Bodhidharma faced a wall for 9 years, in the Tibetan translation of the same passage, the passage reads "faced reality." In explaining Chan to Tibetans, Chinese Chan masters often had to depoetacize their texts to make them understandable to Tibetans. Studying Chan texts in Tibetan translation is illuminating because of the (invisible) oral commentary that was required to make often multivalent passages in Chinese comprehensible to non-Chinese speakers, and it gives us a sense of use of how colloquial passages that are hard to understand were understood at that time.

I suggest you pick up a copy of Tibetan Zen.

Taigen Dan Leighton
Dōgen’s Appropriation of Lotus Sutra Ground and Space

The Lotus Sutra is prominent among the many sources quoted by Dōgen in his
writings, highlighting the Mahāyāna context of his teachings and worldview.
In this paper I focus on Dōgen’s use of the pivotal story in Lotus Sutra chapters
fifteen and sixteen—the myriad bodhisattvas emerging from underground and
the inconceivable life-span of the Buddha—to express his own worldview of
earth, space, and time as enlightening forces. The shift in perspective expressed
in this sutra story reflects a fundamental shift in East Asian Buddhist soteriology.
A close reading of Dōgen’s references to this story discloses how his hermeneutical
play with its imagery of ground, space, and emptiness expresses
immediate awakening, beyond stages of cultivation; he cites the inconceivable
life-span story as an encouragement to present practice.

...

A full investigation of the roles of metaphor, polysemy, and intertextuality in
Dōgen’s writing would be illuminating, but is far beyond the scope of this essay.
However, Dōgen’s use of metaphor as applied to “ground,” “underneath,” and
“space” may be somewhat clarified by some of Paul Ricoeur’s discussion of metaphor.
Ricoeur says, “The understanding of a work taken as a whole gives the
key to metaphor…. The hermeneutical circle encompasses in its spiral both the
apprehension of projected worlds and the advance of self-understanding in the
presence of these new worlds” (Ricoeur 98, p. 7). Dōgen’s playful interpretations
of the world of the Lotus Sutra certainly express a pre-understanding of
a “projected world,” and also a self-understanding, or rather, Dōgen’s particular
understanding of the inner nature of self itself, from his Buddhist perspective.
His interpretive play with the world of the Lotus Sutra, in turn, further informs
and explicates the world of Dharma and practice he is expressing.

I would argue that Buddhist modernism fails to recognize the existential questions that have driven people's motivation for practice for the past 2500 years, and seeks to replace the existential questions that drove Buddha to awaken with existential questions that won't lead anyone to awaken.

Saoshun said:
No, it's not. Marigpa was created as ccarrot for a mule to point out non existence of ma rigpa really. It's creating ignorance and enlightenment to realize that there is no really ignorance at all. It's like creating contrast, I not sure if I can put it proper in the word to show what I mean, but ma rigpa is non existent as only means to stop and look.

Malcolm wrote:
My friend, I can assure you that is indeed the case that rig pa becomes ma rig pa. And why? Because vāyu stirred consciousness and that consciousness that does not recognize its own display is ma rig pa. As it states in my forthcoming translation (Wisdom, 12/16) of one of the most seminal of all Dzogchen commentaries:
As such, knowledge (vidyā, rig pa) itself becomes ignorance (ma rig pa, āvidyā) and nondelusion becomes delusion.
And how does this happen?
The trio of the essence, nature, and compassion of the original basis becomes the three ignorances. Since the essence is made the cause of delusion, it is designated “the ignorance of the same identity” and becomes so. Once the nature is made the condition of delusion, since the vāyu of the impelling karma manifests as color, it is designated “the connate ignorance” and becomes so. Compassion is made the result of delusion. Since pristine consciousness manifests as different names, that is designated as “the imputing ignorance” and becomes so. As such, from not recognizing that knowledge and ignorance have the same cause, like the front and back of one’s hand, the ignorance of the same identical cause arises from not arriving at ultimate nonduality. The connate ignorance (arising from the preceding) is a term of duality, meaning as soon as the conceit “this is originally pure” occurs, it is inseparable from that ignorance. Thus, ignorance depends on knowledge and delusion depends on nondelusion.
And as Vimalamitra states:
The vidyā that is moved and stirred by vāyu
is subtle; its stirring is difficult to understand.

You might wish to reconsider your point of view in this light.

And by contrast, doesn’t Svatantrika refute self-nature in the ultimate and yet insist that any phenomenon must have some conventional inherency which is only considered existent once a valid cognizer correctly labels it?

Malcolm wrote:
Nope. All Bhavaviveka says is that in the refutation of an opponent's position, a consequence is insufficient to convince them of emptiness. They must be shown that emptiness is provable through a formal syllogism which destroys their position. Candrakirti disagrees, and asserts that a mere consequence is sufficient.

There are other things for which Candrakirtī (and later Tsongkhapa and many others) criticize Bhavaviveka, but they are inconsequential to his main point.

In other words, Tsongkhapa's Svatantra is not represented by Bhavaviveka. His Svatantra is just as idealized a school as his Prasanga. Neither idealized position exists in Indian Madhyamaka in the manner in which Tibetans since the 12th century have presented it.

It has taken some time for scholarly consensus to grapple with this, but it has gradually come around. In brief, Tsongkhapa's Madhyamaka is his own. Brilliant, unique, and scholarly, but it is not a Madhyamaka that is recognizable in any Indian school. In fact it represents a rapprochement of Madhyamaka dialects with a species of Buddhist logic invented in Tibet by Phyapa at Sangphu (a famous opponent of Candra and the formulator of the system of logic employed in Gelugpa).

I ask because it seems like it's a "calling card" of (alleged) Enlightened-ati: To have (and often share publicly) a dramatic enlightenment experience. In certain groups I hang out with, having experienced a life-changing "transformation" or "discontinuity" is a prerequisite to be taken seriously.

For example, no where have I ever insisted that anyone listen to me because I have the benefit of expertise in Tibetan, have done a solitary three and 1/2 year retreat, and have been awarded an Ācarya (slop dpon) degree in Tibetan Buddhism as well as a degree in Tibetan Medicine.

Malcolm wrote:
It rather depends on what you mean by awakening. Awakening itself is the first moment of the so called ārya or noble path. This is then followed by a gradual eradication of the two kinds of obscuration. Prior to this moment of awakening, one is trying to realize the union of emptiness and compassion. When that is realized, one has awoken.

The point, which really seems to escape you, is that we all already know this. This is the essence of studying tenet systems for example, where it is understood that Vaibhashika is superior to Pudgalavada, Sautrantika superior to Vaibhashika, Yogacara superior to Sautrantika, and Madhyamaka the supreme intent of Buddha's common Mahāyāna teachings.

However, there is such also thing as community consensus, and on such issues as rebirth, the existence of three kāyas and so on, the career of the bodhisattvas, there is here too a general consensus. For example, there is a consensus among Japanese Buddhists that their ordinands are monks. However, there is a wider consensus that they have not fit the bill as such for some centuries, and definitely not since the Meiji era. I don't pretend to be expert at negotiating these differing consensuses, but then I don't have to be. For example, there maybe a consensus among Vajrayāna Buddhists that the only path to awakening in a single lifetime, from soup to nuts, is highest yoga tantra, but in conversations with people who do not share that consensus, I don't discuss it at all. What would be the point? So I don't bring it up.

jundo cohen said:
Further, many doctrines and beliefs which may be inaccurate based on their original premise can be retained for other reasons. For example, I no longer believe that the "Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch" represents the accurate and actual words of the Sixth Patriarch "Hui-neng", if such a person in that capacity actually existed at all. Scholars have produced very strong, redundant and convincing evidence that the work was written later, is largely fiction, possibly as a bit of inter-sect politics.

I had been in a cult which left me devastated. I won't name the cult because of TOS of Dharmawheel. As a result I spoke out against the cult and its teacher. I created a group called the Survivors for former members of the cult. The group became a success and in September of last year His Holiness the Dalai Lama met with Survivors and even invited them to attend his teachings in India this year. I have received a lot of thanks from people over the years for creating the group. One man even thanked me for saving his marriage. When I first created the Survivors group I wasn't sure if I did the right thing. We after all where being critical of our former teacher. So when I asked for advice I was surprised to get two different answers. One teacher told me it was the wrong thing to do, and I did break my samaya. He went so far to suggest the result will be hell for me when I die. The other teacher on the other hand said I did nothing wrong. The teacher from the cult I was in had broken his samaya with His Holiness the Dalai Lama and had been expelled from his university. According to the second teacher I had no samaya to break. I have struggled with this for several years and would like to know how others feel about it. Did I do the wrong thing by creating the group? Just in case I did  send a letter to my former teacher and begged his forgiveness for speaking so harshly about him. I would like to get past this but I really don't know enough about samaya to know which teacher is correct. So any help would be appreciated.

Sorry for any confusion - I am not saying that a valid mind depends upon a valid object and vice-versa. What determines whether an object is valid or not is the cognizer that apprehends it. Mind is primary. What I meant was, there is no mind without and object and no object without a mind, thus they mutually depend upon each other; you cannot have one without the other, otherwise mind would inherently exist as the Chittamatrins assert because it wouldn't depend on anything.

Malcolm wrote:

Although it is true that dreams awarenesses and gross waking minds do not differ in the sense that the dream is a mere appearance to the dreaming mind and the waking world is a mere appearance to the gross waking mind, we cannot say that the consciousness of living beings is wholly invalid when compared with the consciousness of a Buddha. Chandrakirti says that anything imputed by worldly people in dependence upon a valid name ­ should be realized without investigation to be existent in just the same way as they are spoken of by worldly people.

I will let any of you pick the subject, state your premises and argue your case. Then I will respond. You can pick any point or topic you wish within Buddhism (or, for that matter, any matter). I am game.

There are only two rules: Remain civil, comrades in the Dharma. Gentle language, let us treat each other with respect. Second, do not discuss or debate among yourselves. You are all playing against only me, the Soto Zen guy, like in one of those group chess matches. You can make the first move. Anything you like.

Tsongkhapafan said:
The definition of valid cognizer is a cognizer that is non-deceptive with respect to its engaged object. Conventionally, if the mind is valid the object that it perceives is also valid and exists, and mind and object are mutually dependent.

Malcolm wrote:
If you assert, as you are, that a valid cognizer depends on a valid object, and that a valid object depends on a valid cognition, the consequence of this is two fold: a valid object will always be valid, irregardless of whether it is cognized or not, because it determines whether or not the cognition that perceives it is valid or not. A valid cognizer will always be valid irrespective of whether it's object is delusive or nondelusive because its validity is what makes the object valid.

For example, in a dream, appearances seem valid. We react to them as if they are valid. We only determine dream appearances to be invalid when we wake. How is waking consciousness actually different than a dream consciousnesses? Unlike a dream, we have no outside reference to judge its validity. However, our waking consciousness is merely a dream as well, and when compared with the consciousness of a Buddha, is found to be wholly invalid.

But beyond that the two systems indeed look very similar to me in terms of philosophical approaches. Practice might be different though - or maybe not even. I was surprised to read somewhere in this forum the claim that the Vijnana Bhairava (with which I'm not familiar) apparently contains references to practices similar to Tögel. Of course we can always claim that a certain practice is "not exactly" the same as another one, but such an argument is really futile. Just look at the enourmous amount of various tantric texts in Vajrayana, where each and every text says something slightly different than the other one.

Malcolm wrote:
Thögal, indeed all of Dzogchen teaching, is not about yogic technique — it is a systematic approach to liberation based on a comprehensive understanding of the Dzogchen account of how one's consciousness effortlessly trapped itself and how it may effortlessly frees itself from the very same trap.

The third area of difference between Kashmir Śaivism and Vedānta concerns the essence, the substance, the basis of this universe. Vedānta holds that this universe is untrue, unreal. It does not really exist. It is only a creation of illusion (māyā). Concerning this point, Kashmir Śaivism argues that if Lord Śiva is real, than how could an unreal substance come out from something that is real? If Lord Śiva is real, then His creation is also real. Why should it be said that Lord Śiva is real and Hs creation is an illusion (māyā)? Kashmir Śaivism explains that the existence of this universe is just as real as the existence of Lord Śiva. As such, it is real, pure, and solid. This is nothing about it at all which is unreal."
-- pg. 104, Kashmir Shaivism, The Secret Supreme; 1st Books,  2000.

In Dzogchen it is held that the appearance of the universe is caused by the imputing ignorance which is a result of the neutral awareness at the time the basis arises from the basis not recognizing its own appearances as being its own state. Needless, to say, that mind is also empty, and lacks any nature or inherent existence. That mind is also individual, which accounts for why Samantabhadra woke up at the time the basis arose from the basis, and sentient beings did not.

In short, the foundation of Dzogchen teachings is the Buddha's teaching of the five elements, five aggregates, emptiness, dependent origination,etc.; while the foundation of Kashmir Shaivism is Samkhya, with an added eleven principles on top of Samkhya's original 25, in addition to asserting there is only one universal puruśa, Śiva, as opposed to Samkhya's assertion that there are infinite individual puruśas.

getting more specific, here are the parallels (which are not identities--he is not saying they are the same, but somehow similar) Reynolds claims
Here there are some philosophical parallels with Dzogchen. Although the Tibetan term rtsal, “energy, potency, potentiality”, is never glossed as Shakti in the Dzogchen texts, the conceptions embodied in these two terms are quite similar. The Dzogchen term rig-pa’i rtsal, “the potency or energy of awareness”, could almost be translated as Vidyashakti, which is a technical term found in the Shaiva and Shakta systems. It refers to the energy inherent within the primordial non-dual Awareness which gives rise to the diversity of manifestations. Also, the term for “manifestation” or “appearance” (snang-ba, abhasa), is found in a similar context in both systems.
Malcolm has dismissed the idea of a "primordial non-dual Awareness which gives rise to the diversity of manifestation."

OK, but what about the parallel of rig-pa'i rtsal and Vidyashakti?

As I pointed out to you already, bhāva (existence) is included in svabhāva.

Nāgārjuna is saying that if you cannot prove or establish svabhāva, you cannot prove bhāva. If you cannot prove bhāva, you also cannot show abhāva, i.e., nonexistence, since abhāva is always the nonexistence of something that once existed.

According to The Golden Letters, there are significant similarities between the Dzogchen and Shaktism view.
The view associated with Kashmiri Shaivism and with Shaktism is known as Shaktivada, wherein Maya, or the world illusion, in all its diversity, is granted a certain ontological status. This diversity is an illusion in the sense that it lacks any inherent or independent reality, but it does possess a kind of relative reality in that it represents the energy, or shakti, of Chit, or primordial awareness (chitshakti). Maya is thus not just a mistake in perception, mistaking the rope for a snake; it is not something merely passive but something active and dynamic, a creative energy, or Mayashakti, which brings diversity into manifestation. Here there are some philosophical parallels with Dzogchen. Although the Tibetan term rtsal, “energy, potency, potentiality”, is never glossed as Shakti in the Dzogchen texts, the conceptions embodied in these two terms are quite similar. The Dzogchen term rig-pa’i rtsal, “the potency or energy of awareness”, could almost be translated as Vidyashakti, which is a technical term found in the Shaiva and Shakta systems.

Suppose that you refute the tetralemma without affixing any such qualifications [ comm: like essentially, inherently, instrinsically ]:
you refute the position that things exist and you refute the position that things do not exist; you then say "It is not the case that they both exist and do not exist". If you now continue with the refutation saying "It is also not the case that they are neither existent not nonexistent", then you explicitly contradict your own position. If you then stubbornly insist, "Even so, there is no fallacy", then the dabate is over because we do not debate with the obstinate.

Malcolm wrote:
Tsongkhapa is refuting a position no one takes.

Let me spell it out for you again. Nāgārjuna makes the contention that existence is actually a subset of inherent existence, when it is analyzed [not before]. When existence [inherent existence] is negated, the nonexistence of that existence is negated as well [since there is nothing present to be negated]. The third term, "existent and nonexistent" is refuted because there are some who claim that in the process of arising, a given thing can be asserted to both exist and not exist at the same time. The fourth term, neither existent nor non-existent, was refuted to refute sophists.

Since Tsongkhapa never had to deal with Jains, etc, he in effect never really saw the point of the third term, and assumed they were unnecessary double negatives. But in India, there were people who asserted both the third term and the fourth term, so it was necessary to reject all four extremes in turn.

Well yes, but what does "does not in fact exist" mean from the speakers perspective? And what does "cannot actually be ascertained" mean from the speakers perspective? And what does "valid mind" mean from the speaker perspective?

So obviously he introduces "actual existence" (existing in fact) in addition to "ultimate existence" and "dependent or imputed existence". That is a novelty!

Astus said:
Those who practice the Great Vehicle use the method of “transformation (of the mind)” because they understand that amid our afflictions there is our inherent Buddha nature. It is like forging steel from iron. The nature of steel is within the wrought iron. If we throw away the pieces of iron, we will not be able to refine the steel. Similarly, “there is no water besides the waves.” Therefore, in Mahayana, bodhisattvas cultivate the myriad good practices of the six paramitas. By benefiting self and others, they transform afflictions, and return to their pure inherent nature. Just as when we practice charity for a long time, we will naturally diminish greed. By contemplation of compassion, anger will naturally subside. When we are diligent in the cultivation of actions, speech, and mind, we can overcome sloth. When the mind is scattered and confused, we must use samadhi to overcome delusive thoughts. This is known as “transformation.” The last of the six paramitas is “prajna.” Prajna overcomes ignorance. Our mind is filled with ignorance and confusion; it easily forms attachments to the external environment. If we can reflect inward, without falling into dualism, without the concept of subject and object, and attain “triple emptiness,” we will attain prajna paramita. We can then face each encounter with clarity and mindfulness, thereby extinguish all our afflictions.

In the Ultimate Vehicle, we neither transform our afflictions nor extinguish them; our mind is originally pure and lucid. This mind is inherent in everyone; we do not need to seek it externally. This is the Chan School’s principle of “affliction is bodhi; birth and death (samsara) is nirvana.”"[/i]

Malcolm wrote:
I am pretty certain I don't agree with the characterization of Mahāyāna ārya practice above.

I fail to see a distinction between this so called "great vehicle" and this so called "ultimate vehicle." For example, the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra states:
The characteristic of the element of formations and the ultimate
is the characteristic of being free from being the same or different;
whoever conceives them as being the same or different, 
they have entered in improper view.
And the Madhyāntavibhāga states:
These two, samsara and nirvana,
arise adventitiously.

Herbie said:
"Novelty" certainly is relative because an interpretation that differs from other interpretations is just another interpretation. I mean Tsongkhapa and other interpreters, they all referred to the same main Madhyamaka sources. The difference of Tsongkhapa's philosophy is that it is completely rational as to use of language in the context of objects of knowledge and that there are no mystical esoteric gaps in his philosophy represented often by the term "ineffable". Because of its linguistic rationality there is no need to seek refuge in esoteric concepts. Objects are objects of knowledge and what is known can be linguistically and consistently expressed. The hallmark of his philosophy is the concept of "inherent existence" which renders the concept of "emptiness" philosophically intelligible because speaking of something as empty one should be able to say what it is empty of without damaging the world of human conventions which includes the conventions of language, the conventions of all sciences, the conventions of all religions and the conventions of all philosophies. In this sense Tsongkhapa's philosophy as philosophy is a meta-system because it covers all other systems and thus it is also perfectly applicable in a non-religious ("secular") context.

A: "Sudden" means instantly stopping false thought. "Enlightenment" means [awareness] that one attains nothing.

and

"Sudden Enlightenment means liberation during this lifetime. Just as a lion-cub, from the moment it is born, is a real lion, likewise anyone who practices the Sudden-Enlightenment method has, from the moment he begins his practice, already entered the Buddha-Stage. Just as the bamboo-shoots growing in springtime are not different from the parent bamboo-shoots, because they are also empty inside, likewise anyone who practices the Sudden-Enlightenment method to rid himself suddenly of false thought abandons, like the Buddhas, the sense of an ego and a personality forever.
