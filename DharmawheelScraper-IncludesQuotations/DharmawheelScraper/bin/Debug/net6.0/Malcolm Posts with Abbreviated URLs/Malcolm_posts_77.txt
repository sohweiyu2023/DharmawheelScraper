I realize this thread is about Triyik Yeshe Lama, but the Bonpo Dzogchen practitioner might be interested to know that the Shardza Tashi Gyaltsen text translated as "Heartdrops of the Dharmakaya" is a very useful instruction that covers all the same topics covered in Yeshe Lama, but has the nice feature of not being wordy and being very down to earth. Of course there are those who will disagree, but I feel the description of the view in the section on Trekcho is very good. I have had the transmissions of many Dzogchen texts and I find myself coming back to "Heartdrops" more and more, especially as my practice develops, I find its simplicity to be easy to read when you need a short glance and don't want to get too heady into information.

Many years ago, in 1992, ChNN advised us not to look at thogal texts prior to receiving total instructions. So people in the DC should not read that or any other togal text just because they feel like it. They should wait until ChNN or some other qualified master can bestow the teaching on them in a proper way.

My point about availability is a little different, however. I feel the text classical texts should be available, since to a large extent they are self-secret. But this does not mean people should just go ahead and read them without having had the instruction from a qualified teacher. If they do, there is a good chance they will create obstacles for their practice. So people should be mature.

For all interested people:

ChNN is giving a wonderful teaching on tögal. He even permitted people to come who have never before received teachings or transmission. Anyone who asked him was allowed to come or so I understand.  There are 1100 people in attendance from all over the world. This is probably that largest single group of people outside of Tibet to receive tögal teachings at one time.

There was no empowerment. Rinpoche did only the very simplest of introductions during the first session and has spent the last three days explaining how to do this practice very thoroughly through all four visions, how to recognize them, how to develop them and the signs of attaining each one.

Namo Guru Bhyah!

He also explained very carefully why and how Dzogchen is a separate vehicle; how and why it is also related to Vajrayāna; and how and why Dzogchen does not need to depend on the methods common to Vajrayāna. He also explained why people should not be averse to the methods of Vajrayāna and why they are useful and important. All in all a balanced presentation.

He also clearly explained the principle of rainbow body and great transference body similarities and differences.

Agreed, about the anxiety and poor food part; but still, according to my understanding, Ojas should not be released with the semen at all, regardless of the season.

Basically, Lhugpa-- I could care less what Sivananda and Auer say. I care what Medicine Buddha says, Padmasambhava,Caraka, Sushruta, Vagbhata, etc. People are very confused about this issue because the tantras discuss these issues in an indirect and obscure way and people ignorant of their true meaning interpret them in many incorrect ways. On the other hand the Ayurvedic traditon and Tibetan Medical tradition discuss these things clearly and openly.

For example, Padmasambhava, since he knows medicine quite well, in the text I mentioned in the KN, discusses how to divided the rasa and kitta of the bindu. Why? Because ojas is the final physical product of the digestion of food, the final rasa.

For example, the explanatory tantra states:

"The final state of the semen (sukra) of the physical constituents (saptadhātu) is the supreme one called "ojas"; located in the heart, pervading the entire body, and causing longevity, and causing a radiant complexion and a brightness."

As I said, Caraka, etc. identify this as a clear fluid in the body, surrounding the heart etc. It is physical, not non-physical.

You do not seem to understand that in the Tibetan translation of the Aṣtangahridayasamhita, ojas is translated as mdang when it refers to ojas, and gzi mdangs when referring to a radiant complexion, and mdangs 'gyur when referring to pitta that exists in the skin, i.e. bhrajaka pitta.

That may be, but I don't see any benefit in expelling the physical aspect of Thigle/Bodhicitta (semen) from one's body at all, whether in the context of Tantra or Dzogchen.

Malcolm wrote:
There is a very good reason: if you block or forcefuly prevent ejaculation, it will result in semen stones and impotence long term. It is bad for the health of your body. If the semen moves, you should just let it go. Sukra is a kitta (snyigs ma, waste product), it is an impurity to be expelled from the body, like it's female counterpart, menstrual tissue and the oocyte, like all the kittas in the process of digestion, for example, sweat, hair, nails, rectal grease, and so on.

What is important to conserve is ojas, this is the real thigle or bindu we should care about. Ojas is most likely to be lost with semen in hot seasons like the summer (from the first day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar to the first day of the seventh month) when people are eating food with little rasa or bcud -- therefore one should only ejaculate bi-weekly during this season. In the winter one can ejaculate as much as one likes (up to five times a day) because people generally eat food that is very oily, (snum, snigdah̨) and nutritious (rasa, bcud) during this season. Every other day is the proper ratio during early spring and the fall.

No, they are not. And definitely not in Anuttarayoga tantra.

Other than that, she looks around and sees nothing but wickedness everywhere... except in little babies and animals, which she also enjoys.

I know that sadhanas really work and work quickly, but I suppose without refuge and bodhicitta and mantra they are not going to work too well, eh? My mom wouldn't even chant anything because she thinks meditation is a way for evil spirits to enter you.

In Tibetan Medicine the spleen is the spleen, located on the left side of the body, above the pancreas. These are the types of spleen illnesses we identify explicitly as "spleen" illnesses: hot spleen illness, blood bloating, wind spleen, phlegm spleen, and swollen.

Weak stomach heat i.e. jaṭaragni is not related to the spleen itself in either Tibetan Medicine or Ayurveda. However, your intuition is good.

It seems that in Chinese medicine the spleen means the liver, and the liver means the spleen. The liver is indeed responsible for transformation and nourishing blood and muscles in Tibean Medicine. So in my opinion when Chinese medicine is talking about spleen deficiencies we would understand this as a problem with the liver's ability to process nutrients. Our approach would be to restore liver heat, and then one can eat whatever one likes without avoiding anything. The possible approach to this would be to do a round of Pancakarma or failing that, a seasonal cleanse to remove lymphatic blockages, cleanse the biliary pathways, and cleanse the intestines of excess mucous which is blocking the uptake of nutrients in general.

This is essentially a cold liver disease from a Tibetan Medical POV.

However, everything in the world is medicine when one knows how to use it. Everything in the world is poison when one does not know how to use it. This also applies to hallucinogens. For example, there is promising research that taking LSD,etc., reduces anxiety about death in terminally ill patients. There is research that shows that MMDA helps permenantly alleviates PTSD. Marijuana is proven to reduce nausea in people doing chemo-therapy, and those who have long term chronic pain, and its effects are much less destructive that opiates. Alcohol also has many medicinal effects. The Buddha permitted monks to use alcohol for medical conditions. So we must have a flexible view.

Perfectly respectible non-Buddhist people are better people because they have had spiritual experiences from taking Ayahuasca, and so on. We may not make that choice for ourselves, but we are in no position to judge them.

Some people destroy their lives with food. But no one suggests that we all stop eating.

The difference between modern pharmaceuticals and Tibetan and Ayurvedic formulas (as well as Chinese formulas) is that the former have no track record and are relatively recent. The latter have been tested on human popluations for 1000 years+ and their effects, dosages, indications, and counter-indications are well known and described.

The caveat is that herbal medicines, like their allopathic counterpart, require a) a medical theory which underlies a nosology b) a clinically experienced doctor trained in that field of medicine.

I personally have no confidence in the efficacy of homeopathic formulas. But they are also not harmful. So if people want to spend their money on them, I have no problem with it.

Sorry, I did not read your previous explanation of this, but can you please explain how the body processes foods differently than medicines according to TM? My initial impression is that the body is going to process anything that is ingested p.o. in the same way via the same digestive processes. How does the body distinguish between a food/herb and a medicine?

Sorry if I'm being obtuse here.

Thanks.


Malcolm wrote:
According to the four tantras, it states that medicines are completley digested within an hour or so after after being ingested. Food take seven days to fully digest. When you use herbs for too long, the herb in question is no longer digested rapidly. By digest, we mean for the rasa of the food to work its way through the blood, muscle, fat, bone, marrow and semen.

There are of course some exceptions, but not many.

But in all other cases besides the b/v issue, you can easily recover Sanskrit pronunciation just from looking at the Tibetan text - for example, even though Tibetans say "Bhekhandze" or "Sutokhayo" etc, the Tibetan text retains the Sanskrit pronunciation.  So why would they have chosen to transcribe Sanskrit व in such a way that it is unclear whether it should be pronounced v or b?  Since no Tibetan words contain ཝ, then presumably this character was invented specifically to transcribe व.  So why was it not used uniformly?

Malcolm wrote:
I did not say there were no Tibetan words that use ཝ, just that there are very few. If you examine that construction of ཝ you will see that it is a modified བ.

ཝ means fox, BTW. For example, I have seen varttika spelled with both a བ and ཝ. Just chalk it up to human inconsistency and move on.

Also, from this conversation it appears likely that even Guru Rinpoche himself might have said "Bajra," being that he was from the north.  This would also explain why written Tibetan Sanskrit uses བ instead of ཝ for many cases where originally you would have व.


Malcolm wrote:
No, this is more easily explained than that: in Tibetan,  བ and ཝ are pronounced the same way in some dialects such as Amdo. Also, བ following a ད is also pronounced ཝ, as in དབང་. There, it is like that at the point when Thonmi was formalizing Tibetan grammar, བ and ཝ were pronounced very similarly and were in some sense interchangable. In fact, there were very few Tibetan words that begin with ཝ, and no words that contain it.

Tibetan pronunciation of mantras can be accounted for very easily. Most Tibetans did not know Sanskrit, and pronounced mantras in texts phonetically as they saw them, rather than as they were intended, for example pronouncing ཛ་ as dza rather than ja, which is what was intended, or  pronouncing ཙི་ཏཏ་as tsitta rather than citta.

The thing which we all wrestle with is the death of our loved ones.  Especially if you're strongly attached like me.  You spend countless hours and dollars with them and on them, all of which has the appearance of meaning, and then it's over one way or another.  I understand the Buddhist premise that we should be more emotionally available to all beings and not limited in our loving-kindness, but, while not impossible, it doesn't necessarily completely dispense with certain attachments that we're naturally going to have with our loved ones.  But what do I know?  I'm afflictively attached to people in my life, to myself, to "my world," and so much more, and I probably have accumulated only about 45 total hours on the cushion.

Buddhists believe in rebirth. Buddhists also claim that there is no chronological first beginning to the series of past lives. We have all of us been reborn an infinite number of times. No God is needed to start the series off – for there simply was no first beginning. Things have been around (somewhere) for all eternity.

If rebirth is true, realistically we really have no hope. It is a hopeless doctrine.

I cannot imagine being reborn as a stinkbug precisely because there is nothing to imagine. I quite simply would not be there at all. If rebirth is true, neither I nor any of my loved ones survive death. With rebirth, for me – the actual person I am – the story really is over. There may be another being living its life in some sort of causal connection with the life that was me (influenced by my karma), but for me there is no more.  There is no more to be said about me.

If Buddhism is correct, then unless I attain enlightenment or something like it in this lifetime, I have no hope.  Clearly, I am not going to attain enlightenment in this life.  Many of you will be inclined to accept that as true about myself and about your own enlightenment, as well, since enlightenment is a supreme and extremely rare achievement - not for the likes of someone like me.  So I and all my friends and family have in themselves no hope.  More than that, from a Buddhist perspective, in the scale of infinite time, the significance of each of us as such, as the person we currently are, converges on nothing - for each of us lives our lives and then perishes.  Then we're lost forever.

Again, if rebirth is true, we really have no hope. It is a hopeless doctrine.

We're doomed:

How bad could it get? A recent study by MIT projects that without "rapid and massive action" to cut carbon pollution, the Earth's temperature could soar by nine degrees this century. "There are no analogies in human history for a temperature jump of that size in such a short time period," says Tony McMichael, an epidemiologist at Australian National University. The few times in human history when temperatures fell by seven degrees, he points out, the sudden shift likely triggered a bubonic plague in Europe, caused the abrupt collapse of the Moche civilization in Peru and reduced the entire human race to as few as 1,000 breeding pairs after a volcanic eruption blocked out the sun some 73,000 years ago. "We think that because we are a technologically sophisticated society, we are less vulnerable to these kinds of dramatic shifts in climate," McMichael says. "But in some ways, because of the interconnectedness of our world, we are more vulnerable."

But pitta, which is considered to be the heat of the body, primarily, has various functions which frankly, you can't observe. All you can do is observe, "they have this theory.

No, actually the whole passage relates the progress of togal to the five paths of standards Buddhist systems, so Capriles apparently really does not understand the principle being enunciated here.

This passage from the rig pa rang shar:

Then, the free arising of appearances having understood the appearances of wisdom is seen to be like a cloud of Dharma, mounting the tenth stage, Clouds Of Dharma. That is the resting place of those persons who have seen the truth, without giving this up they mount the stage.

Means that in these schemata, this tenth stage is only equivalent to Mahāyāna first bhumi. In the rig pa rang shar scheme, bhumis 1--9 are equivalent to the common Mahāyāna path of accumulation and application. Bhumis 10-16 are equivalent to the Mahāyana path of seeing, cultivation and so on.

Hm I don't know but an interesting thing is that in the Rigpa Rangshar that is available in wylie on the internet there is no mention of "realization". I suppose they could have used a different version. Anyway, after looking at the Tibetan of those lines and a bit after the description of the 16 bhumis I think it really is referring to thogal and nothing else. So maybe better to not speak about it much anymore hehe.

Kai said:
Thats what I thought initially but Namdrol said that there is another interpretation out there.....oh well........

But even if thats the case, thanks to the quotation in the previous page, I now have an general idea on how the confusing Bhumis scheme works out. Following from the previous page;

Mahayoga ==> 13th Bhumi and anuyoga===> 14th Bhumi and Atiyoga ===> 15th or 16th Bhumi

Given the fact that only Longde and Menngagde had the four visions that lead to the Full Buddhahood which is the 16th Bhumi. Its suffice to say that Semde ===> 15th Bhumi

Now, this is how it was represented in the nine yanas system and we know that after evolving for centuries, Anuttarayoga is not the same as Mahayoga, anuyoga, etc. Indeed, it has often been stated that the four yogas of Mahamudra is synonymous with the four yogas of Atiyoga Semde and several masters and practitioners had stated the same thing over the years. Gelug and Kagyu share the same teachings on Mahamudra while Sakya integrated it into their tantric system. And the Jonang school practiced Kalachakra in which Mipham stated before that it contained the Dzogchen teachings on Trekchod. In conclusion, all the Sarma schools do contain methods and viewpoints that can bring one to the 15th Bhumi which is called "Vajradhara".

That could be the reason why over the years, several masters are so quiet about sixteen Bhumis thingy because its really a non issue as there is only a minor difference in the level of ultimate final attainment between two systems. I guess this finally (at least partially) resolves the few major discrepancies and confusion that exists between the presentations of various systems.

And had none of us been arguing, we wouldn't have known so much or that we have been doing a non argument. So everyone

Thirteenth bhumi is referred to as Vajradhara. The fourteenth and fifteenth bhumis have their own names, and the sixteenth bhumi is well know as Uttarajñāna, Highest Wisdom or Yeshe Lama, the realization of ka dag chen po.

In ancient Anatolia people danced on the earth-covered ruins of the Hititte Leviathan and built their lodges with stones which contained the records of the vanished empire's great deeds. The cycle has come round again. Ameruca is where Anatolia was. It is a place where human beings, just to stay alive, have to jump, to dance, and by dancing revive the rhythms, recover cyclical time. An-archic and pantheistics dancers no longer sense the artifice and its linear His-story as All, but as merely one cycle, one long night, a stormy night that left Earth wounded, but as a night that ends, as nights end, when the sun rises.

Well, I agree with you because the present green movement in general works from the principles set out by the social ecologists i.e communalism. While I have no problem with people who want to live together in such a way, I do not. Bookchin writes:

Property, in this ethical constellation, would be shared and, in the best of circumstances, belong to the community as a whole, not to producers ("workers") or owners ("capitalists"). In an ecological society composed of a "Commune of communes," property would belong, ultimately, neither to private producers nor to a nation-state.

Deep ecology in general does not support the notion that it is proper to own nature in any sense. This is one difference we have with social ecologists. But we live in a society governed under an inherited Roman Jurisprudence. Even so, though people think that there is such a thing as private property, in reality all people have a lease.

You and KTD often complain of regulation. Naess writes:

"Private industy is, in spite of its official "free and competitive" nature, shot through with internal regulations, mostly unknown to the general public, but no less coercive for all of that. The smaller unit industry of green societies will, because of less hierachichal power structure among other reasons, need less regulation. Much depends on the change of mentality: the less mental change in the green direction, the more regulations." (Ecology, community and lifestyle: Naess, Cambridge Univerisity Press, 1989)

What Naess is arging here is that with the fundamental shift in ethical priorities, the need to regulate of industrial harmful side effects (pollution, deforestation, etc.,) will be ameliorated through culture change, just as less and less people smoke and drink these days, just as attitudes towards race have shifted dramatically in the past 50 years (even despite some reactionary back lash) towards egalitarianism), in the same way, cultural transformation will render these discussions we are having obsolete. Just as it is more or less second nature for most people in the US these days to avoid smoking, likewise, when we wean our culture off the crystal meth of oil, someday the idea that we would need regulation to make sure that people did not pollute the water or the air, or cut down vast swaths of forest for short term profits will seem unthinkable.

The ecological society of the future will not be a choice. The ecological society that emerges after this one, however, can scarcely be imagined. But we cannot continue the way we are moving as a civilization.

See N-la this is where my concern is. I mean an ant on an anthill is "part of the matrix". So I mean what's to stop a human queen bee with all her soldier ants making all of us "part of the matrix" too? This is where I still think that the Western idea of property rights is of some use because it is a safeguard against precisely that kind of concern.

I totally accept your concern about large scale rapacious capitalism. But where do we meet in the middle here? You yourself said that we could still have businesses and factories "where permissible" - again that scary word. So how do we meet in the middle here? At what point does someone trading a basket for someone else's spear become rapacious upon the environment? In other words at what point does trade that is "free" become harmful?

When I say I am an anarcho "capitalist" what I really mean is that collectivism scares me more than individualism. And being subsumed back into the "matrix that spawned us" sounds to me an awful lot like a type of collectivism that is going to have to be enforced via coercion.

I mean when we have collapsed the cave of hope and fear are we still deep ecologists? Isn't it just another reference point?

Malcolm wrote:
From my perspective, your concerns are more appropriately voiced with reference to social ecology, which for all of its pretense to be an ecological theory, is still basically marxist, still basically a collectivism, now rebranded as communalism. Trust me, I am no more interested in living on a commune, or a kibbutz, than you are.

Permissible in this context means that when the necessary cultural transformation occurs that will allow for a deep green society to unfold, people will understand what kinds of industries are appropriate and what are not. Will there be needs for some kinds of controls (regulations), sure. Everyone can see that markets, for example, are part of the commons, and therefore, also require protection. This is actually the underlying notion of a so called "free" market. It is free because everyone can participate in it. It is also something which needs protection from time to time because markets show a marked inability to regulate themselves when subject to certain pathological pressures. When you understand that markets are a commons, then you will understand why it is necessary to protect everything that can enter a market. Markets are no more self-regulating than any other natural system. Like every other natural system, they only find a balance when they are in their proper niche. When they invade other niches, other "commons", they become unhealthy and cancerous. Free Market Ideology and the ensuing liberalization of trade around the world has lead to this state of affairs. These are all faults not of regulation, but of deregulation. Cap and trade is a failure because it represents an attempt to let the market determine the price of pollution, thus leading to the atrocities mentioned by Heruka. The present form of green capitalism is doomed to failure for the same reasons the housing industry failed. It is another bubble. You heard it here first.

Capitalism eats itself. This is the main problem with unrestricted capitalism.

So the issue comes, how do we determine how much capitalism, how much manufacturing, what kind, etc. All of these are problems for which I confess I have no solution apart from a radical change in our social values, what we find important.

Property rights translated into civil rights when the notion of ownership transitioned from "pater famililias" to the individual person. We need to both extend the notion of rights to creatures (as we already do in Buddhism) and to our environment. We need to understand that all creatures have rights merely by virtue of being sentient. From a Buddhist POV, after all, this is what natural virtue and non-virtue is based on i.e. the fundamental recognition that taking the life of creatures of immoral, and so on. Sooner or later we have to realize that destroying our environment is immoral because of the "civil" rights of our environment. Our world is not inert dead matter. It is teaming with life, and it is not just there as ours to take and dispose of as we wish.

The greatest ongoing cost of building a sustaintable community is not land, it is labor. Combine that with the rising costs of fuel, and you have a combination that makes it very hard to succeed in building an intentional community.

What we are basically talking about is switching back to a nineteenth century economy (localized) where wood is your primary energy source, supplemented by oil, with human and animal labor as your primary labor force. In order to make this community work, you will have become largely proficient in providing the majority of your own food. This means convertible husbandry.  Thus, you will need to build a manure factory. If you have 30 acres of arable land, you will need to maintain a herd of fifteen cows (one cow produces enough manure every year to fertilize two acres), manure ponds, etc. In other words, you will need to become an expert in composting manure. You will need to do this to maintain the fertility and health of your land. You will need to learn (if you don't already know) how best to can, preserve and otherwise maintain your summer and fall harvests for the winter, as well as feed your animals through the winter. And you will need a lot of committed people who are willing to live on just food and lodging to help you out in the howling wilderness we call "post-industrial" civlization. Most communes, or whatever you want to call it, fail because they do not adequately understand how to farm. In short, if you really want to make this work, you will have to become a farmer.

Good luck! Really, I mean it.

A moment later you were living in a different world, one in which earlier priorities and beliefs had to make room for the immense and terrifying fact that your civilization was in deep trouble and next to nobody was willing to see that, much less do anything about it. That was your initiation into peak oil, and the feverish reading and thinking that most of you probably did over the weeks and months that followed were the equivalent of the magical student’s daily meditations and rituals, which stabilize the new pattern and begin the hard work of teaching the initiate how to make constructive use of what the initiation has provided."

the ebb and flow of the abiotic vs peak oil debate.


Malcolm wrote:
What a real petroleum geologist has to say about abiogenic oil (it's bullshit, of course and is only used as FUD by right wing conspiracy theorists). *Note that following paper is dated after 2004,the year of the debate among your journalists.

Geoffrey P. Glasby of the Laboratory for Earthquake Chemistry, Graduate School of Science, University of Tokyo writes:

"Summary
The preceding sections have outlined the two principal
theories of abiogenic formation of petroleum hydrocarbons.
The Russian-Ukrainian theory of deep, abiotic
petroleum origins was an attempt to formulate a scientifically
rigorous theory of hydrocarbon formation
which could play a major role in the exploration and
exploitation of hydrocarbon deposits in the Soviet
Union in the immediate post-war period. The theory is
rigorous in its interpretation of the thermodynamic data
for the conversion of methane to higher hydrocarbons at
high temperatures and pressures. However, the formation
of higher hydrocarbons from methane is only one
step in the complex chain leading to the formation of
commercial petroleum deposits and there are several
major objections to this theory. First and foremost is the
fact that the mantle is too oxidizing for methane to form
there in abundance. Furthermore, most volatiles including
methane are transported from the mantle to the Earth’s
crust in magma and not by faults as required by the theory.
The occurrence of major oil and gas fields in crystalline
basement rocks was also taken as confirmation of
the abiogenic theory. However, this assumption predates
modern theories of fluid migration in the Earth's crust.
The theory also identified a number of mechanisms by
which higher hydrocarbons can be formed abiogenically,
of which serpentinization of ultramafic rocks does have
the potential to produce commercial oil and gas fields.
Proponents of the abiogenic theory have also emphasized
perceived inadequacies of the biogenic theory for the formation
of petroleum hydrocarbons.
However, at the time that the abiogenic theory was at
its peak from the 1950s to the 1980s, it was not possible
to assess the relative merits of these two theories objectively
on the basis of the then existing scientific data
and this only became possible with the development of
much more sophisticated techniques for the analysis of
the organic constituents in petroleum such as GC/MS in
the 1980s. As a result, a much more detailed understanding
of the pathways of organic constituents from
source rocks to petroleum was established which
offered convincing evidence to support the biogenic
theory. By contrast, the abiogenic theory made no real
attempt to explain the formation of the very complex
mixture of organic compounds which make up oil.
A major claim of the Russian-Ukrainian theory of abiogenic
hydrocarbon formation is that it had major successes
in the discovery of oil and gas deposits in crystalline
basement rocks. However, it now appears that the great
oil fields of the Volga-Urals region, the northern Urals
and western Siberia were discovered not as a result of
application of this theory as its proponents claim but by
the use of conventional exploration methods which gave
“the final word to the borehole”. Furthermore, recent studies
of the petroleum resources of the Dnieper-Donets
Basin in the Ukraine by the U.S. Geological Survey have
been interpreted entirely within the framework of conventional
petroleum geology with no mention made of an
abiogenic source of hydrocarbons. These failures of the
Russian-Ukrainian theory in areas where it has claimed its
greatest successes essentially bring its role as a viable theory
on which to base exploration programmes for commercial
hydrocarbon deposits to an end. As a matter of
fact, this theory is now largely forgotten even in the
Former Soviet Union and virtually unknown in the west.
The deep gas theory of Thomas Gold is based on the
assumption that deep faults play the dominant role in
the continuous migration of methane and other gases to
the Earth's surface and that this methane is then converted
into oil and gas in the upper layers of the Earth’s
crust. However, this reaction is not thermodynamically
favourable under these conditions and can not be facilitated
by the presence of bacteria. In addition, deep
drilling of the Siljan Ring did not offer any convincing
evidence for a dominant mantle source for hydrocarbon
formation there. This theory is therefore invalid."

Deep ecology is an interesting one. I'm not convinced that a Buddhist ontology naturally leads in that direction....usually there is a Spinozist kind of monism underpinning deep ecology, and/or a German romanticism which reifies "nature" to be God's playground.

Naess's thinking was influenced by Spinoza, Mahāyana Buddhism, eetc.

I think maybe in some of the East Asian Buddhisms, where there are Taoist influences coupled with Buddha Nature extended into the phenomenal world, a deep ecology could be defended. And I suppose within the context of Tibetan Buddhism, the kinship between humans, spirits and environment involves a very delicate interdependence. So I suppose that is where the idea is coming from.

Malcolm wrote:
Classical ecological appeals in Buddhist literature (and always to kings) tend be social in their wording, but the assumptions they spring from are deep.

tobes said:
But I'm not sure about the Indian traditions per se. The natural world is considered conditioned like everything else. Impermanent, something to be liberated from. There is no metaphysical reason to privilege the natural or biological world ahead of the world of production and social relation. There are all imbued with the same ontology.

Malcolm wrote:
I don't agree. What one is liberated from are the afflictions, one is liberated in the world. The common metaphor of environmental harmony in classical Indian sources is the rishi surrounded by predators and prey in a jungle retreat where all are abiding peacefully.

tobes said:
And actually, I quite like EF Schumacher's argument: a Buddhist inspired economics would begin by an ethical consideration of what is really valuable for humans. Production is important because, not only do we need to eat, but if it is structured ethically, it offers the possibility of kusala activity.

I think maybe deep ecology devalues production too much. As far as I can see, the problem is not production per se, but how it is currently configured and what motivates it.

Malcolm wrote:
I think you are conflating anarcho-primitivism with deep ecology. Deep ecology is not a form neo-ludditism.

For example, Naess writes:

"The early morning sun also lightens up a faraway (thirty miles long) string of metallic electric masts and thick wires -- hydroelectric power destined for Oslo, two hundred miles away. Each mast is an elegant structure revealing much love and ingenuity on the part of the engineers, but such a string of masts transforms the landscape. If only a few mountainous landscapes were changed in this way -- why complain and feel sorrow? But the number of landscapes without these strange beings diminishes rapidly. There are now more than two million gigantic masts around. The masts would have have a less disturbing character if the power was used to increase the quality of life. But to a large extent, the power is wasted, which contributes to making people unaware of their fantastic material richness..." (An Example of Place: Tvergastien, The Ecology of Wisdom, Naess, Counterpoint, 2008)

However, he also notes:

"The environmental crisis could inspire a new rennaissence; new social forms for co-existence together with a high level of culturally integrated technology, economic progress (with less inteference), and a less restricted experience of life." (Ecology, Community and Lifestyle: Outline of an Ecosophy, Naess, Cambridge University Press, 1993)

But here is a quintessential and often ignored principle of Naess's thinking. Many people unfairly claim that deep ecology insists that human beings must sacrifice themselves on the cross of environmental martyrdom, and sadly, many people professing the deep ecology view do make these kinds of claims -- but both parties have either not read Naess clearly, or they are choosing to ignore him. He writes:

"The special obligation we have for our own species requires us in the long run to ensure that a population has what is necessary to provide the conditions for reaching the ultimate goals of humankind and satisfying vital needs. Beyond that, our obligation is to life in general and to the earth as a whole aquire priority."
This is an echo of Santideva' instruction to preserve one's own health in order to benefit others.

And:

"High level humanitarian norms justify ecologically negative policies. The policies however should be short-range. And often, these short-range, ecologically harmful policies can be avoided through the cooperation of rich and poor nations on a greater scale than ever before." (Sustainability! The Integral Approach, The Ecology of Wisdom, Naess, Counterpoint, 2008)

Malcolm wrote:
Buddhism is a eudaemonic view, and also suspectible to reactionary appropriation. But here the author is taking pains to point out that Naess's personal take on how to best prosecute deep ecology is too polite.

In other words, he is saying that deep ecologists need to be less worried about rocking boats, or thinking that by rocking boats, they are being bad deep ecologists, he provides the answer right here:

Deep ecology presents a dominant ‘social harmony’ view of social change. This can smother over contradictions in industrial capitalist societies, whereas a ‘social conflict’ view (which Left Biocentrism takes), which has historical roots in Marx and Marxism, is needed to combat ecocide and social injustice.

In order to engage in social conflict, people need to have discipline. The social harmony view, in Orton's mind, undermines the ability of deep ecology to be relevant to the social justive issues, which he regards as unfortunate since he sees human social justice issues as unfolding out of environemental issues. If you are too concerned with social harmony, then the trenchant inequalities and social justice issues of industrial capitalist societies will just go unheeded.

But since social justive issues actually spring from our unhealthy relationship with the biosphere, Orton says:

Karma Dondrup Tashi said:
the left-right distinction is subordinate to the anthropocentric-deep ecology divide. Coming into a new relationship with the natural world is primary, and social justice for humans must keep this in mind ...

Malcolm wrote:
[/quote]

In other words, if we change how we relate to the world, human social justive issues will be more easily addressed.

Further, we frequently talk past each other because of how deep ecology has redefined the right/left divide. You are still thinking an terms of androcentic right/left terms. I do not. For me, androcentric = right wing; biocentric = left-wing.

The deep ecological intuition is that true social justice for human beings will flow out of a human social and economic reorientation with the the rest of our biosphere, and not until then. Since the deep ecological inuition transcends the androcentic right/left squabbles, the left biocentrism is free of the constraints of the old left/right paradigm. The struggle at present is that the green movement internationally has been largely coopted by post-marxists like social ecologists whose thinking is pervaded by moribund anthrocentrism. It is hard for people to see that deep greens are really green all the way through and not merely watermelons. Though I joke about being a watermelon, in reality, the watermelon analgy is sad. The real deep ecology approach is green all the way through.

Truthfully, deep green or left-biocentric thinking emphasizes bioregionalism, it is anti-capitalist and anti-industrial, advocates radical decentralization of power and governments, is concerned with human social justice issues because they arise out of our fractured relationship with our world etc. The underlying principle though is inclusion of all beings in all descision making, hence John Seed's Council of All Beings, etc.

Anarchism, too, is entirely androcentric, and that places it to the right of the equation.

IMF Chief Economist Goes Public


World Bank: Chief Economist, Stiglitz Goes Public


From The Best Democracy Money Can Buy, Greg Palast, reporter for the London Times

New York Times bestseller, part of two articles on the global economy taken from this excellent expose

The Globalizer Who Came in from the Cold: The IMF's Four Steps to Economic Damnation


"It has condemned people to death," the former apparatchik told me in a scene out of a Le Carre novel. The brilliant old agent comes in from the cold, crosses to our side and, in hours of de­briefing, empties his memory of horrors committed in the name of a political ideology he now realizes has gone rotten. Here be­fore me was a catch far bigger than some used Cold War spy. Joseph Stiglitz was chief economist of the World Bank. To a great extent, the new world economic order was his theory come to life.

I "debriefed" Stiglitz over several days—at Cambridge Univer­sity, in a London hotel and finally in Washington during a big con­fab of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund in April 2001. Instead of chairing the meetings of ministers and cen­tral bankers as he used to, Stiglitz was kept safely exiled behind the blue police cordons, the same as the nuns carrying a large wooden cross, the Bolivian union leaders, the parents of AIDS victims and the other "antiglobalization" protesters. The ultimate insider was now on the outside.

In 1999 the World Bank fired Stiglitz. He was not allowed a discreet "retirement"; U.S. Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, I'm told, demanded a public excommunication for Stiglitz's having ex­pressed his first mild dissent from globalization World Bank-style.

In Washington we talked about the real, often hidden, work­ings of the IMF, World Bank and the bank's 51 percent owner, the U.S. Treasury.**

In addition to the Ecuador document, I had by 2001 obtained a huge new cache of documents, from sources unnamable, from inside the offices of his old employer, marked "confidential," "re­stricted" and "not otherwise [to be] disclosed without World Bank authorization." Stiglitz helped translate these secret "Country As­sistance Strategies" from bureaucratese.***

There is an Assistance Strategy specially designed for each na­tion, says the World Bank, following careful in-country investiga­tions. But according to insider Stiglitz, the Bank's staff "investigation" consists of close inspection of a nation's five-star ho­tels. It concludes with the Bank staff meeting some begging, busted finance minister who is handed a "restructuring agreement," pre-drafted for his "voluntary" signature (I have a selection of these).

Each nation's economy is individually analyzed; then, accord­ing to Stiglitz, the Bank hands every minister the exact same four-step program.

Step l
Step 1 is Privatization —which Stiglitz says could more accurately be called "Briberization." Rather than object to the sell-offs of state industries, he says national leaders—using the World Bank's demands to silence local critics—happily flog their electricity and water companies. "You could see their eyes widen" at the prospect of 10 percent commissions paid to Swiss bank accounts for simply shaving a few billion off the sale price of national assets.
And the U.S. government knows it, charges Stiglitz—at least in the case of the biggest "briberization" of all, the 1995 Russian sell-off. "The U.S. Treasury view was this was great as we wanted Yeltsin reelected. We don't care if it's a corrupt election. We want the money to go to Yeltsin" via kickbacks for his campaign.

I have to interject that Stiglitz is no conspiracy nutter ranting about Black Helicopters. The man was inside the game, a member of Bill Clinton's cabinet as chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers.

Most heinous for Stiglitz is that the U.S.-backed oligarchs' corruption stripped Russia's industrial assets, cutting national out­put nearly in half, causing economic depression and starvation.

Step 2
After briberization, Step 2 of the IMF/World Bank's one-size-fits-all rescue-your-economy plan is Capital Market Liberalization. This means repealing any nation's law that slows down or taxes money jumping over the borders. In theory, capital market deregu­lation allows foreign banks' and multinational corporations' in­vestment capital to flow in and out. Unfortunately, in countries like Indonesia and Brazil, the money simply flowed out and out. Stiglitz calls this the "hot money" cycle. Cash comes in for specu­lation in real estate and currency, then flees at the first whiff of trouble. A nation's reserves can drain in days, hours. And when that happens, to seduce speculators into returning a nation's own capital funds, the IMF demands these nations raise interest rates to 30 percent, 50 percent and 80 percent.

"The result was predictable," said Stiglitz of the hot money tidal waves in Asia and Latin America. Higher interest rates de­molished property values, savaged industrial production and drained national treasuries.

Step 3
At this point, the IMF drags the gasping nation to Step 3: Market-Based Pricing, a fancy term for raising prices on food, water and domestic gas. This leads, predictably, to Step 3l/2: what Stiglitz calls "the IMF riot." The IMF riot is painfully predictable. When a nation is "down and out, [the IMF] takes advantage and squeezes the last pound of blood out of them. They turn up the heat until, finally, the whole cauldron blows up"—as when the IMF elimi­nated food and fuel subsidies for the poor in Indonesia in 1998 and the nation exploded into riots. There are other examples—the Bolivian riots over water price hikes pushed by the World Bank in April 2000 and, in early 2001, the riots in Ecuador over the rise in domestic gas prices that we found in the secret Ecuador "Assis­tance" program. You'd almost get the impression that the riot is written into the plan.

And it is. For example, we need only look at the confidential "Interim Country Assistance Strategy" for Ecuador. In it the Bank states—with cold accuracy—that they expected their plans to spark "social unrest," their bureaucratic term for a nation in flames.

Given the implosion of the economy, that's not surprising. The secret report notes that the plan to make the U.S. dollar Ecuador's currency has pushed 51 percent of the population below the poverty line, what Stiglitz called their squeeze-until-they-explode plan. And when the nation explodes, the World Bank "Assistance" plan is ready, telling the authorities to prepare for civil strife and suffering with "political resolve." In these busted nations, "resolve" means tanks in the street.

Each new riot (and by "riot" I mean "peaceful demonstration dispersed by batons or bullets") causes panicked flights of capital and government bankruptcies. Such economic arson has its bright side, of course—foreign corporations can then pick off a nation's remaining assets, such as the odd mining concession or port, at fire-sale prices.

Stiglitz notes that the IMF and World Bank are not heartless adherents to market economics. At the same time the IMF stopped Indonesia from "subsidizing" food purchases, "when the banks need a bail-out, intervention [in the market] is welcome." The IMF scrounged up tens of billions of dollars to save the coun­try's financiers and, by extension, the U.S. and European banks from which they had borrowed.

A pattern emerges. There are lots of losers in this system, but two clear winners: the Western banks and U.S. Treasury. They alone make the big bucks from this crazy new international capital churn. For example, Stiglitz told me about an unhappy meeting, early in his World Bank tenure, with the president who had just been elected in Ethiopia's first democratic election. The World Bank and IMF had ordered Ethiopia to divert European aid money to its reserve account at the U.S. Treasury, which pays a pitiful 4 percent return, while the nation borrowed U.S. dollars at 12 per­cent to feed its population. The new president begged Stiglitz to let him use the aid money to rebuild the nation. But no, the loot went straight off to the U.S. Treasury's vault in Washington.

Step 4
Now we arrive at Step 4 of what the IMF and World Bank call their "poverty reduction strategy": Free Trade. This is free trade by the rules of the World Trade Organization and World Bank. Stiglitz the insider likens free trade WTO-style to the Opium Wars. "That too was about opening markets," he said. As in the nineteenth century, Europeans and Americans today are kicking down the barriers to sales in Asia, Latin America and Africa, while barricading their own markets against Third World agricul­ture.

In the Opium Wars, the West used military blockades to force markets open for their unbalanced trade. Today, the World Bank can order a financial blockade that's just as effective—and some­times just as deadly.

Stiglitz is particularly emotional over the WTO's intellectual property rights treaty (it goes by the acronym TRIPS, of which we have more to say later in this chapter). It is here, says the econo­mist, that the new global order has "condemned people to death" by imposing impossible tariffs and tributes to pay to pharmaceuti­cal companies for branded medicines. "They don't care," said the professor of the corporations and bank ideologues he worked with, "if people live or die."

By the way, don't be confused by the mix in this discussion of the IMF, World Bank and WTO. They are interchangeable masks of a single governance system. They have locked themselves to­gether by what they unpleasantly call "triggers." Taking a World Bank loan for a school "triggers" a requirement to accept every "conditionality"—they average 114 per nation—laid down by both the World Trade Organization and IMF. In fact, said Stiglitz, the IMF requires nations to accept trade policies more punitive than the official WTO rules.

Stiglitz's greatest concern is that World Bank plans, devised in secrecy and driven by an absolutist ideology, are never open for discourse or dissent. Despite the West's push for elections through­out the developing world, the so-called Poverty Reduction Pro­grams are never instituted democratically, and thereby, says Stiglitz, "undermine democracy." And they don't work. Black Africa's productivity under the guiding hand of IMF structural "as­sistance" has gone to hell in a handbag.

Did any nation avoid this fate? Yes, said Stiglitz, identifying Botswana. Their trick? "They told the IMF to go packing."

So then I turned on Stiglitz. Okay, Mr. Smart-Guy Professor, how would you help developing nations? Stiglitz proposed radical land reform, an attack at the heart of what he calls "landlordism," on the usurious rents charged by propertied oligarchies worldwide, typically 50 percent of a tenant's crops. I had to ask the professor: As you were top economist at the World Bank, why didn't the Bank follow your advice?

"If you challenge [land ownership], that would be a change in the power of the elites. That's not high on [the Bank's] agenda." Apparently not.

Ultimately, what drove Stiglitz to put his job on the line was the failure of the Bank and U.S. Treasury to change course when confronted with the crises—failures and suffering perpetrated by their four-step monetarist mambo. Every time their free market so­lutions failed, the IMF demanded more free market policies.
 
"It's a little like the Middle Ages," the insider told me. "When the patient died they would say, 'Well, he stopped the bloodletting too soon; he still had a little blood in him.'" I took away from my talks with the professor that the solution to world poverty and cri­sis is simple: Remove the bloodsuckers.

Deep Ecology and the Left – Contradictions
“There is clearly both in capitalist and socialist politics things which can be modified and used in sane eco-politics but essentially green politics will be something deeply different.” Arne Naess, Ecology, community and lifestyle, p. 160.

“The most forceful and systematic critique of capitalism is found in socialist literature. This makes it natural for supporters of the deep ecology movement to use socialist criticisms of capitalism in their own work, and, looking at the slogans of green parties it is immediately clear that many of these slogans are also socialistic or at least compatible with some sort of socialism. As examples: no excessive aggressive individualism. Appropriation. Community, production for use, low income differentials, local production for local needs, participative involvement, solidarity. On the other hand, it is also clear that some socialist slogans still heard are not compatible: maximise production, centralization, high energy, high consumption, materialism…It is still clear that some of the most valuable workers for ecological goals come from the socialist camps. One of the basic similarities between socialist attitudes and ecological attitudes in politics is stress on social justice and stress on social costs of technology.” Naess, Ibid, p. 157.

“Deep ecology comes home as the strategy of advanced capitalist elites, for whom nature is what looks good on calendars.” Joel Kovel, The Enemy of Nature, 2002, 1st Ed., p. 172.


INTRODUCTION

This blog post is an examination of the contradictions I see in the relationship between deep ecology and the Left. I contrast in this discussion the human-centered traditional Left, with the ecocentric Left which has come into a relationship with deep ecology. With some notable exceptions (e.g. Judi Bari, Andy McLaughlin, Richard Sylvan, Fred Bender, Stan Rowe, Andrew Dobson and Rudolf Bahro), the Left has been hostile to deep ecology. Why is this? Is there something intrinsic to deep ecology, which is seen as incompatible with the beliefs of a person of the Left? Arne Naess, the philosophical founder of deep ecology, had an evident sympathy towards the social justice side of socialism. The above quotes by Naess clearly show this, as does the 1973 foundational article, “The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology Movement. A Summary.” However, for Naess and countless others, a new ecopolitics will be “deeply different” from socialist and capitalist politics and will not be some kind of add-on to socialism. The ecological question cuts across all “isms.”

The Left, no matter what its myriad forms have been, is politically associated with social justice for the human species. This is its universal symbolism and important contribution. I am a person of the Left. Concerning human-centered politics, my main sympathies are on the communist/socialist side. Anti-communism ends up signalling an alliance with Capital. There are legions of ‘Leftists’, particularly in North America, who do not share this perspective, having had anti-communism and the Cold War pounded into them and internalized from an early age. However, I believe that the ecocentric Left has to be Earth-rooted. It can be non-communist, but not anti-communist. Ecological justice for all species and the planet must be primary. For Arne Naess, this primacy of the natural world is considered an “intuition” and not logically or philosophically derived. We are first Earthlings, in personal and social consciousness, but we must also be involved in social justice issues for our own species. As the environmental cliché says, “There can be no social justice on a dead planet.”


DISCUSSION

I consider myself as both a supporter of deep ecology and a long-time Canadian leftist. Over the years my meshed sense of being has been sorely tested by fellow leftists – as in the misleading attitude towards deep ecology, conveyed, for example, by the Joel Kovel quote above. (See my review of his book.) But my personal identity has also been tested by my own criticisms of deep ecology, made from an ecocentric Left perspective. As I have written in the past, much deep ecology writing is obscure and not particularly relevant to practical environmental or green work. Also, most deep ecology writers do not present any real political, economic or class guidelines for activists. The response of deep ecology writers to criticisms from the Left and to my own writings, has helped me work out my contribution to the left biocentric theoretical tendency within deep ecology.

As the left biocentric tendency has gathered some support (the internet discussion group “left bio”, for example, has been running for over eleven years), I have found it necessary to distance myself from a few supporters who could not ditch their anti-communism and anti-Marxism, or who have attempted to bring into contemporary ecopolitics echoes of past Left divisive battles – often, it seems, associated with Trotskyism.

This distancing has also been directed at people who could not face criticism of their social justice support, e.g. for aboriginal positions. These people are opposed to seeing Earth justice as a priority (see for one example, my recent review of Disrobing the Aboriginal Industry), or are uneasy about public calls for human population reduction (as in the eight-point Deep Ecology Platform. They also see deep ecology as a reformist eco-philosophy within capitalism; and are uncomfortable with my critical, yet friendly, support for someone like the Finnish eco-philosopher Pentti Linkola (see my review of his book).

Another problem for me concerns ecocentric Leftists who are stuck on being defenders of Israel and are seemingly blind to the horrible situation of the Palestinians.

Green parties have become shallow ecology defenders of industrial capitalist society, even if Arne Naess was supportive of them. The German Green Party theoretician Rudolf Bahro resigned from the party in the early 1980s, and pointed out that green party shallow ecology  is content to “brush the teeth” of industrial society. Nothing happened since Bahro made this statement which calls his observations into serious question. My limited experience with the Canadian federal Green Party reinforces Bahro’s statement.


SOME LEFT CONTRADICTIONS

Why is the Left so negative about deep ecology? And why is it misleadingly alleged by ecosocialist Joel Kovel that, “Like many deep greens, however, Orton hates socialism and considers it doomed to remain in its twentieth-century form”? (Kovel, The Enemy of Nature, 2nd ed., p. 302)

For the traditional Left, human interests have priority, not the health of ecosystems and their non-human inhabitants. There is a basic reductionism – “we have the answers” – in the thinking of the Left. I have found an intrinsic conservatism towards new ideas among the Left. This has always puzzled me, given that socialists want a new society, allegedly different from capitalism. Shouldn’t the Left be open to and embrace new ideas? The Left has to fundamentally move beyond its traditional human-centered thinking, to see what contemporary Earth-centered ecopolitics is about. Left reductionism takes various forms, but the current eco-Marxist variant claims that Marx really is an ecologist, if only we understand him correctly and therefore he is a (or the) role model for ecological work today. The 1988 proposal for a “Left Green Network”, inspired by Murray Bookchin and the ideas of social ecology, took the position that, to be a Green and also on the Left, could only mean to be a supporter of social ecology: “Left Greens are social ecologists.” There was no room at this network inn for left deep ecology supporters. (As a Canadian, one has to also note that the network proposal reflected the imperial nature of U.S. society, with Canada being considered an appendage for signing-on purposes.)

There is arrogance among socialists who think that they should be leading the ecological movement, because they have a “class analysis” and are anti-capitalist. What comes across is that the Left believes it is entitled to intellectual hegemony in the green and environmental movements, by virtue of prior knowledge. The Left does not seem to be able to absorb the pluralism of green and environmental politics – as Naess informed us, “the front is long” – let alone accept the earned leadership of others by virtue of their practical or theoretical work. Ed Abbey noted, through the character Doc Sarvis in The Monkey Wrench Gang, the importance of practical involvement in actual environmental struggles: “Let our practice form our doctrine, thus assuring precise theoretical coherence.” (p. 68) The idea that deeper environmentalists and greens can come to an anti-capitalist critique based on their own experiences, without studying Marxism or social ecology, but based on field experience, seems, apparently, difficult to grasp for the Left.

A contemporary manifestation of this Left arrogance, is their desire to define a future post-industrial-capitalist society as “ecosocialist”, and not as something being struggled over by countless environmental and green activists. By using this name, ecosocialists imply that they have the answers and know the path forward. Yet there are lots of tentative ideas about the shape of future post-industrial-capitalist societies. These are being widely discussed, experimented with, and written about, but it is a work in progress. There is no “ecosocialist society” on the horizon to which we all can rally.

Ecosocialists traditionally attack the ecocentric Left around population, aboriginal issues and about being critically supportive of theorists like Pentti Linkola. (This Finnish thinker has been called an eco-fascist. I do not believe this to be true, as my review of his recent book makes clear. In my next blog post I will further examine what “eco-fascism” is all about. I have recently become aware that those sympathetic to national socialism are not adverse to “borrowing” analysis from deep ecology to further their own ends.)

Other fault lines between the “ecosocialist” and ecocentric Left concern:
a) The ecosocialist hostility toward the spiritual component of social change as well as the promotion of a animistic spiritual/psychological transformation, so that the interests of all species override the self-interest of the individual, the family, the community and the nation.

b) Ecosocialists deny the role of individual responsibility in destructive ecological and social actions. They don’t recognize the necessity to practice voluntary simplicity so as to minimize one’s personal impact on the Earth.

c) A disagreement that it is not capitalism per se, but industrial societies that create the social formation at the heart of our dilemmas. The ecocentric Left believes that these societies can have a capitalist or socialist face.

Left doctrines in the past have focussed on the human condition, not on the well-being of other species and of Nature itself. From a Left perspective, nature and other species have been viewed as “resources” for human consumption. Deep ecology has zeroed in on this. John Livingston, the late Canadian eco-philosopher, who was not a person of the Left but who was a supporter of deep ecology – really Canada’s Arne Naess – has laid out in his writings the implications of “resourcism” for planetary health. (See “John Livingston – An Appreciation”. The benefits from this focus on human kind have been enormous for a number of us but deadly for the planet.


DEEP ECOLOGY CONTRADICTIONS

“The deep ecology movement carries an excessive amount of rubbish with it (in contravention, so to say, of its own platform). That does not imply that there is not a clean sound position to be discerned when the often inessential rubbish is removed...” Richard Sylvan

“Personally, I agree with almost everything you say in the Left Biocentric Primer...It’s a real shame that the Green parties came under the influence of Bookchin and not your version of Left Biocentrism – it’s obvious that’s where they need to head. So, I have no necessary bones to pick with your idea of a Left wing of the Deep Ecology movement, more power to you and your colleagues. I wonder if the word ‘Left’ is the appropriate one to use (as opposed to social justice).” Extract taken from a personal letter written by deep ecologist George Sessions to me, and also copied to Arne Naess, Bill Devall, Andrew McLaughlin and Howard Glasser, dated 4/19/1998.

Since coming to support deep ecology in the mid-1980s, I have tried to maintain a critical, yet supportive, stance towards it and, where it seemed appropriate, have given my dissenting views publicly. Richard Sylvan, the late “deep green” Australian philosopher and forest activist, was an early role model for me on this. In the past, I have raised various issues, for example:

a) I examined the criticisms that are raised about the key concept of Self-realization within deep ecology, e.g. that it ignores the importance of “place.” I emphasized that Self-realization must avoid feeding the self-help, self-cultivation, or personal transformation movement, at the expense of collective change. (See the My Path to Left Biocentrism document, “Notions of Self in the Age of Ecology”.)

b) I explored the confused views of Naess on ‘sustainable development’.

c) I disagreed with the view (by Naess and others within deep ecology) on the separation of the peace, social justice and ecology movements. I argued that this can feed a right-wing image and makes deep ecology supporters seem uncaring about human issues.

d) I criticized the anti-communist and anti-China attitudes of some Buddhist Tibetan supporters of deep ecology (including some left biocentrists) like Joanna Macy, past CIA employee (see my review of her autobiography Widening Circles: A Memoir.)

e) I exposed the self-absorption of some deep ecology-inspired academics – whose writings dominate journals like The Trumpeter – because the articles lack relevance to problems faced by movement activists which need deep ecology insights and analysis.

f) I supported the work of George Sessions and Bill Devall, in introducing and popularizing the thought of Arne Naess at an early stage in North America. Sessions and Devall are not of the Left and this was reflected in how they handled, or did not handle, criticisms (some justified) and attacks from Left-leaning critics of deep ecology. Note in this regard, Sessions’s uneasiness with the term “Left”, in the quote above; and Devall’s eagerness to state that the environmental movement was a “loyal opposition” and that “Political revolution is not part of the vocabulary of supporters of the deep, long-range ecology movement.” (See Dharma Rain: Sources of Buddhist Environmentalism, p. 386)

There are two important contradictions within deep ecology, which need to be resolved so that this eco-philosophy can further unfold its revolutionary potential:

1. Deep ecology presents a dominant ‘social harmony’ view of social change. This can smother over contradictions in industrial capitalist societies, whereas a ‘social conflict’ view (which Left Biocentrism takes), which has historical roots in Marx and Marxism, is needed to combat ecocide and social injustice. The social harmony perspective undermines the necessity to mentally prepare for the coming social strife associated with working for ecological and major social change.

Naess’s social harmony view (“Ultimately all life is one – so that the injury of one’s opponent becomes also an injury to oneself.” Selected Works, Volume Five, p. 26) produced some guidelines for activists which seem to be out to lunch. For example, “It is a central norm of the Gandhian approach to ‘maximize contact with your opponent!’”; or “Do not exploit a weakness in the position of your opponent.” I think this social harmony view has given an entry to those who have tried to smear deep ecology as being linked to fascism. In my tribute to Naess on his death, I quoted him as saying, when speaking of “intrinsic value” – a fundamental component of his philosophy – “This is squarely an antifascist position. It is incompatible with fascist racism and fascist nationalism, and also with the special ethical status accorded the (supreme) Leader.” (See “Remembering Arne Naess, 1912-2009”) While I unequivocally believe that deep ecology is not “fascist”, yet it does seem to me that a social harmony view of the natural world and the place of humans within this can be used by reactionaries in a fascist manner. Thus the “fatherland” or the “motherland” can be upheld as the supreme good to which the citizen must subordinate herself or himself.

2. A key belief in the philosophy of Naess is that “The ideology of ownership of nature has no place in an ecosophy.” (Ecology, community and lifestyle, p. 175) This is a powerful weapon to undermine the “private property” legitimacy of bourgeois society and its view towards the natural world, that our species has the ‘right’ to decide life and death over other species. Yet not many deep ecology writers in North America are articulating this belief, nor is the US-based Foundation for Deep Ecology promoting it. The now defunct magazine Wild Earth, subsidized by the Foundation, had a number of articles trying to uphold the ecological nature of private property ownership, in an American context. Today the Foundation, through its publications, celebrates “private lands philanthropy”, in North and South America – that is, using and hence reinforcing, the private property laws of bourgeois society to acquire lands for restoration ecology purposes. They never mention the basic deep ecology position of Arne Naess about land ‘ownership’.

I myself have joined with others to contribute funds to buy forest land here in Nova Scotia, in order to prevent its destruction from industrial forestry. But in my writings about this project I have pointed out the contradictions of buying land, resulting from the basic tenet of deep ecology that humans cannot ‘own’ Nature. (See “Community Lands and Deep Ecology”) Industrial capitalist societies are not ecologically or socially sustainable and have to be replaced. This must be said in all our restoration work. Restoration work has no long term future, if the dictatorship of industrial capital is not finally overthrown and replaced by an ecocentric society, which upholds the welfare of all species and is also socially just for humankind.


CONCLUSION

Perhaps it needs to be emphasized that whatever the contradictions within deep ecology, the thinking of Arne Naess, as I noted in my tribute to him when he died in 2009, “has presented a needed pathway for coming into a new, yet pre-industrial old, animistic and spiritual relationship to the Earth, which is respectful for all species and not just humans”. This is the needed message for our time. For left biocentrists, the left-right distinction is subordinate to the anthropocentric-deep ecology divide. Coming into a new relationship with the natural world is primary, and social justice for humans must keep this in mind. The Left can have a meaningful contributory role in a future ecologically focused and socially just post-industrial society, if it accepts and is transformed by the contribution of deep ecology and comes to see itself, in theory and in practice, as an ecocentric Left.

1. Left biocentrism is a left focus or theoretical tendency within the
deep ecology movement, which is subversive of the existing industrial
society. It accepts and promotes the eight-point Deep Ecology Platform
drawn up by Arne Naess and George Sessions. Left biocentrism holds up
as an ideal, identification, solidarity, and compassion  with all life. "Left"
as used in left biocentrism, means anti-industrial and anti-capitalist, but
not necessarily socialist. The expressions 'left biocentrism' or 'left
ecocentrism' are used interchangeably.


2. Left biocentrism accepts the view that the Earth belongs to no one.
While raising a number of criticisms, left biocentrism is meant to
strengthen, not undermine, the deep ecology movement which identifies
with all life.


3. Left biocentrism says that individuals must take responsibility for
their actions and be socially accountable. Part of being individually
responsible is to practice voluntary simplicity, so as to minimize one's
own impact upon the Earth.


4. Left biocentrists are concerned with social justice and class issues,
but within a context of ecology. To move to a deep ecology world, the
human species must be mobilized, and a concern for social justice is a
necessary part of this mobilization. Left biocentrism is for the
redistribution of wealth, nationally and internationally.


5. Left biocentrism opposes economic growth and consumerism.
Human societies must live within ecological limits so that all other
species may continue to flourish. We believe that bioregionalism,
not globalism, is necessary for sustainability. The perspective of the
late German Green philosopher Rudolf Bahro is accepted that, for
world-wide sustainability, industrialized countries need to reduce
their impact upon the Earth to about one tenth of what it is at the
present time. It is also incumbent upon non-industrialized nations to
become sustainable and it is necessary for industrialized nations to
help on this path.


6. Left biocentrism holds that individual and collective spiritual
transformation is important to bring about major social change, and to
break with industrial society. We need inward transformation, so that
the interests of all species override the short-term self-interest of the
individual, the family, the community, and the nation.


7. Left biocentrism believes that deep ecology must be applied to
actual environmental issues and struggles, no matter how socially
sensitive, e.g. population reduction, aboriginal issues, workers'
struggles, etc.


8. Social ecology, eco-feminism and eco-marxism, while raising
important questions, are all human-centered and consider human-to-
human relations within society to be more important and, in the final
analysis, determine society's relationship to the natural world. Left
biocentrism believes that an egalitarian, non-sexist, non-discriminating
society, a highly desirable goal, can still be exploitive towards the Earth.


9. Left biocentrists are "movement greens" in basic orientation. They
are critical of existing Green political parties, which have come to an
accommodation with industrial society and have no accountability to the
deep ecology movement.


10. To be politically relevant, deep ecology needs to incorporate the
perspective advanced by left biocentrism.

Naess needs to be read on his own. Devall and Sessions are tired. No so important-- early adopters who were somewhat clumsy.

But the point that Bookchin misses is that Deep Ecology is not an ideology that can be easily summarized into a theory. Deep Ecology is more of a view, in the sense that we understand view in Buddhist terms. Boockchin is too caught up in leftist polemics to "get" Deep Ecology. There is nothing for a left-wing polemicist to grasp. Why?

The criteria of rights, for a deep ecologist is total. If you want to put into property rights terms, all sentient beings have a right to their own bodies and all the whole planet is a commons owned by none and shared by all living beings upon up. Human beings have the capacity to observe the harm we wreak on the environement, so we have a moral obligation not to do it or to allow. We have an obligation to attempt to preserve the commons of the whole environment for all beings.

Social ecology just doesn't get this.

All of the things you are saying are just abtract talking points -- they do not relate to your life at all. But global warming does, lack of adequate health care does, depletion of rainforests habitat does.

A Buddhist recognizes that all sentient beings, ideally, have a right to live undisturbed. When I say "preserve" the commons, I don't just means for human beings. The libertarian view, specificially, is just more of the same tired old judeo christian roman property rights bullshit. It is entirely androcentric. This is why libertarians are some of strongest foes of the environmental movement and the worst climate-change deniers. It definitely isn't Buddhist. But then niether is communism, socialism, etc. The only position that is remotely Buddhist is deep ecology. But people don't like it because it is not androcentric enough.

The reviewer missed the section where the book chides Americans for wishing to impose an idealized vision of Southern England onto the American landscape.

The book is well worth reading because it shows how American agriculture has proceeded along the destructive lines of southern planters, rather than mid 19the northern restorative husbandry, despites its roots in an idealized vision of the English countryside. Restorative husbandry was introduced to the North in the mid nineteenth century because of the exodus to the west, farmers were abandoning exhausted farms and moving by the thousands to the new territoroes because they would expect to grow another 20 years of crops without having to make manure.

You really need to read the book itself. It is worthwhile and interesting.

Karma Dondrup Tashi said:
A few more questions on this and then I will shut up about it because I admit I really am not an expert on environmentalism.

Did the pre-improver farmers deliberately and with full knowledge of the consequences predate upon their own private property? Or was this basically pretty much a kind of lack-of-knowledge problem? And were the improvers a bunch of pro-statist legislators trying to regulate their way out of trouble? I mean from what little I can glean about this at some point Roosevelt (the first one) got involved but by then the improver movement was done. Or were they a bunch of farmers who basically said, um hey listen guys look at what's happening to our land and we need to start dumping massive amounts of cow poop back on to the soil for us to stay in the game here?

Malcolm wrote:
Basically, what happened was that after the revolutinary war, people in the colonies began abandoning their farms because erosion was rampant, rivers were so polluted with run off fish were dying, and so on. In other words, the agricultural practices of colonial farming was having wide ranging impacts on the whole civilization and everyone was being negatively effected. In reponse to this, northern farmers began to adopt sustainable husbandry practices from the English, and at the same time became critical of the westward push into the midwest by people who were abandoning what these "improvers" felt was perfectly good land, it properly cared for. Indeed, the book points out that Madison himself was something of a proto-Gaiean theorist who argued that we needed to understand the world as a total environment. These folks knew that warming was a result of deforestation and so on. The improvers were people who felt that current practices in the north, the practices of southern planters, and so on were regressive and ultimately, bad for the country.

The context in which all Buddhist teachings occur is that of the sutric explanation of bhumis and paths, so it only makes sense that apologists for a particular viewpoint like Dzogchen will couch their defense in these terms, particularly when they have come in for harsh criticism as being non-buddhist.  The point that I was making earlier is that the paths and bhumis themselves are conventional truth.  They are perhaps useful guideposts for one's practice and can certainly inspire one to develop the tremendous scope of a bodhisattva.  They are not, however objective ontogenetic stages that must be traversed in anything but a metaphorical sense.  They are most certainly not necessary to awaken.

A map is not the territory itself, nor the menu the meal.  They are useful tools, nothing more.

Malcolm wrote:
As I said, bhumis measure qualities, paths measure realization.

Since common Mahāyāna has no method connected with the human body, progress is measured by successive appropriation [via rebirth] of ever more refined bodies which are reflected in the gradual refinement of a person's continuum through the process of eradicating the two obscurations and gathering the two accumulations. These are a hard limitation which cannot be detoured around thorugh some conceptual and philosophical trick.

Vajrayāna, including Dzogchen has a methods connected with the body, and the the resulting paths and stages are measurable via experiences which are described in detail in both Vajrayāna texts and Dzogchen texts. Someone who does not have these experiences does not have the corresponding realizations. These are a hard limitation as well.

Therefore, asking when a tantra was written is a text critical question, rather than a question of ultimate authorship.

In Madhyamika treastises and oral traditions, dependent arising is often
said to be synonymous with emptiness. The term "dependent arising" never
appears in Authenticity, and in any case, it does not sufficiently characterize
how things occur. They are more significantly seen to arise from wholeness
through a manifestation process that gradually splits into apparent subject and
object, hardening and coarsening until they become solid materiality.20 To call
these phenomena "dependent arisings" is not wrong in this view but fails to
indicate their final nature.21 "Dynamic display" (rtsal) is a more precise term
ontologically for Dzogchen because it indicates this connection with the base;
it acknowledges the table as a spontaneous occurrence through the sound, rays,
and light that move forth from the base. As the process coarsens, thought
begins to designate it in certain ways. Thus, it is both spontaneous and reified
due to thought processes of designating it as such.

Whereas to understand dependent arising is to understand the emptiness
of Madhyamaka, such an understanding does not lead to the Dzogchen view.
From a Dzogchen perspective, the same table that Madhyamaka describes as
a dependent arising and therefore empty is, in addition, the dynamic display
of the base (gzhi'i rtsal). The main difference between spontaneous presence
and dependent arising comes not in connection with ordinary objects like
tables, however, but in relation to the base itself, especially in its aspect as
ultimate subject and in the way that phenomena, including thoughts, emerge
from that base.

Bonpos can say all they like there are no processes in the basis, but then they render their whole explanation unintellgiable.

Thanks, didn't yet know Buddhists Dzogchen and Bon Dzogchen are different Dzogchen to degree of disagreement on (a seem to be) one of essential points.

About what you said on processes: whether they are casual or not - actually from the point of DO this is very important as DO is not beyond causes and conditions, that is, it relates to dependent phenomenas only. If someone says rays, light, and sound has nothing to do with causes and conditions means they has nothing to do with processes which DO is about. And how they actually possibly could, being beyond time and space? Process needs time and space, this trio is not in time and space.

How this is not relevant?

Malcolm wrote:
From a Madhyamaka pov there no phenomena which do not dependently orginate. From a Buddhist Dzogchen pov, the basis is not established as something real.

If you think there is something real that exists outside of time, you are deluded beyond hope of recovery.

The reason we say that the basis is "outside of time" is that from the perspective of the basis itself there are no objects, and time depends on objects. If no objects or entities can be established, how can we talk about dependencies or time? But that does not mean there are no processes, because if there were no processes, the basis could never arise from the basis, and so on.

There are a lot of differences between Bon and Buddhist Dzogchen. Since Bon Dzogchen is not fully grounded in Buddhism, it is a somewhat eternalistic in its presentation of these issues.

Hmmmm, Namrdol ofen says emptiness in Madhyamaka and Dzogchen has the same meaning, however currently I'm reading "Undbounded Wholeness" by Geshe Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche and there's a part called "Core Philosophical Issues" where it's stated "Dzogchen and Madhyamaka speak of emptiness, they differ in their actual understandings of this".

Malcolm wrote:
Bon Dzogchen and Buddhist Dzogchen are slightly different.

What we say is that the main difference between Dzogchen view and Madhyamaka view is that the former is experiential and the latter is intellectual. But their content, their meaning, is the same as Jigme Lingpa writes:

“ I myself argue ‘To comprehend the meaning of the non-arising baseless, rootless dharmakāya, although reaching and the way of reaching this present conclusion “Since I have no thesis, I alone am without a fault”, as in the  Prasanga Madhyamaka system, is not established by an intellectual consideration such as a belief to which one adheres, but is reached by seeing the meaning of ultimate reality of the natural great completion.

Norbu Rinpoche states in his Questions and Answers on the Great Perfection:

That view established intellectually we need to establish consciously in dependence upon one’s capacity of knowledge and on convention. The way of establishing that is the system of Prasanga Madhyamaka commented upon by the great being Nāgārjuna and his followers. There is no system of view better than that.

What the Bonpos say is that Dzogchen view of emptiness and the Madhyamaka view of emptiness are different. We Buddhists definitely disagree.

" Wisdom's status as primordial has to do with its being spontaneously arisen from the base and thus not dependent on causes."

Malcolm wrote:
The Unwritten Tantra states:

There is not object to investigate within the view of self-originated wisdom: nothing went before, nothing happens later, nothing is present now at all. Action does not exist. Traces do not exist. Ignorance does not exist. Mind does not exist. Discriminating wisdom does not exist. Samsara does not exist.  Nirvana does not exist. Even vidyā itself does not exist i.e. nothing at all appears in wisdom. That arose from not grasping anything.

If it arose, that means that even in wisdom there are processes. Wisdom is the basis, BTW.

booker said:
"Sound, rays, and light are thus neither dependent on the base nor dependency arisen from the base. They are spontaneously present to it. This is not understood as a relationship of cause and effect."

Malcolm wrote:
The basis possess three wisdoms, essence, nature and compassion. They manifest as sound, lights and rays. However, the Bonpos place much more emphasis on this doctrine than Buddhist Dzogchen does (where it mainly appears as an explanation of the experience of the bardo).

My point was that the there are processess in the basis, whether you want to call them "causal" or not is really quite irrelevant.

And actually Buddhist Dzogchen disagrees with this Bon assessment above. Padmasambhava states:

"Though the trio of essence, nature and compassion exist in reality, they occur as cause, condition and result because of ignorance."

But this is partly why I did not want to get into this. This topic is very complex, and is just a bunch of intellectual proliferation if you are not a practitioner of tögal. Just understand that there are processes in the basis. You can call them spontanous if you want.

Padmasambhava again states:

The luminous part of vidyā in the basis stirs as the five lights. The karmic winds, the condition of vidyā, cause the colors to appear as a house of light. Since that is not understood as wisdom, delusion cognizing the part of dualistic appearances produces delusion about the duality of subject and object.

Garab Dorje explains the reason why there is stirring in the basis in his commentary on The Single Son of the All the Buddhas Tantra:

At that time, from the naturally occurring blessings of the personal experience of the realization of the heart essence (snying thig), having recognized one's own state, in one lifetime, everyone will attain the result of Buddhahood. From now on, the emptied pit of samsara will not appear as the six kinds of living beings. For twenty thousand eons, sentient beings will not appear possessing a bodily form having severed the stream of samsara. After that, from the arising of the subtle latent defilements of different actions, samsara and nirvana will arise in the same way as before.

Why is this possible? Again, the String of Pearls clarifies:

Luminosity itself stores traces.

Luminosity ['od gsal], the nature [rang bzhin], which is the naturally formed [lhun grub] aspect of the basis, stores traces.

As I said, these issues are subtle, difficult and would take a long time to properly flesh out. Since these things take a long to time to flesh out, and since the explanation of the basis and the arising of the basis and so on and forth is really only relevant to tögal practice and is meant to provide a basis for understanding the result of that practice, delving into explorations of that topic prior to understanding the context of that explanation causes people to become trapped in a lot of useless conceptual proliferation.

Incidentally, I do not appreciate the tone of your comments.

It cannot be supposed that [the hypothetical contractors] they should intend, had they a power so to do, to give any one or more an absolute arbitrary power over their persons and estates, and put a force into the magistrate's hand to execute his unlimited will arbitrarily upon them; this were to put themselves into a worse condition than the state of nature, wherein they had a liberty to defend their right against the injuries of others, and were upon equal terms of force to maintain it, whether invaded by a single man or many in combination. Whereas by supposing they have given up themselves to the absolute arbitrary power and will of a legislator, they have disarmed themselves, and armed him to make a prey of them when he pleases ...
Locke


Malcolm wrote:
This is not an argument against having a state. This mere selective citation. You need to include the beginning of the section:

Absolute arbitrary power, or governing without settled standing laws, can neither of them consist with the ends of society and government, which men would not quit the freedom of the state of nature for, and tie themselves up under, were it not to preserve their lives, liberties and fortunes, and by stated rules of right and property to secure their peace and quiet. It cannot be supposed ...

Locke does not in the end actually serve liberatarian ideology since he is interested in how a government will work in the interests of everyone.

His trip about private property merely is a continuation in British jurisprudence of Roman law around private property, which continues also in the American legal system.

In fact Locke says:

Sec. 123. IF man in the state of nature be so free, as has been said; if he be absolute lord of his own person and possessions, equal to the greatest, and subject to no body, why will he part with his freedom? why will he give up this empire, and subject himself to the dominion and controul of any other power? To which it is obvious to answer, that though in the state of nature he hath such a right, yet the enjoyment of it is very uncertain, and constantly exposed to the invasion of others: for all being kings as much as he, every man his equal, and the greater part no strict observers of equity and justice, the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very unsecure. This makes him willing to quit a condition, which, however free, is full of fears and continual dangers: and it is not without reason, that he seeks out, and is willing to join in society with others, who are already united, or have a mind to unite, for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties and estates, which I call by the general name, property.

Sec. 124. The great and chief end, therefore, of men's uniting into commonwealths, and putting themselves under government, is the preservation of their property. To which in the state of nature there are many things wanting.


Ring any bell?  " lives, liberties and estates" = property. People form states to protect it. Jikan's statement is perfectly correct.


George Mason, in his declaration of rights for Virgiania wrote just that i.e. " That all men are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent rights, of which, when they enter into a state of society, they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety."

Jefferson modified this in the Declaration of Independence to read the following way:

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,

This is pure Locke.

Your anarcho capitlism is a desire to return to a state of nature of which, as Locke says, "there are many things wanting". It is in the end really no different than communism or any other utopian fantasy.

Okay, but then, in causality, a certain effect can not be own cause, is that correct?

You were saying basis arises from (or out of) basis so that would mean it is own cause?

Also, typically what is illusion is "within" causes and conditions. In Dzogchen it is often said about out true condition, or true state (which I believe is equivalent terms to basis or kunzhi) which is beyond causes and conditions. Meaning basis does not depend on causes and conditions. How then you say base is illusory?

Or is simply basis name for shunyata, which means not "a thing", and means rather "how" everything works, like say a law. And in this way obviously a law has no condition, because it's just how we express the way of how stuff works. So in this case Dzogchen would not say anything above what is taught in Mahayana. Right?

But then again no, because Dzogchen speaks of rays, light and so on. And AFAIK these are beyond causes and conditions, but how they work is they manifest samsara if one has marigpa or they manifest nirvana when one has rigpa, right? But since they are esssence of those, they're not conditioned by those (by samsara/nirvana).

So what happens here we have say five rays, but they're not phenomenas right? (since all phenomenas arise from causes and conditions, and they "exists" in samsara/nirvana).

Not sure what is precisely about Advaita and I do not really care, however if we say basis is empty, that would mean rays for example would arise from causes and conditions - but this doesn't make sense, since they don't, right? They're essence of elements, so they can't be conditioned by elements, or anything. No?

Emptiness is the same thing in Dzogchen and Madhyamaka. Even rigpa is completely empty. But in Dzogchen we do not say that emptiness is dependent origination because of the way the term dependent orgination is used in Dzogchen. Not because Nāgārjuna is wrong.

booker said:
Thanks.

You answered Rigpa is not dependent originated awareness, but you say it's empty. Obviously this is a contradiction, but you say in Dzogchen dependent origination means something else. Can you please clarify?

Also, in Dzogchen there is said "emptiness" is our real nature, but also there's term "base", then base is explained in terms of essence, nature and energy. How this is the same as Dependent Origination from Madhyamaka? Is Madhyamaka DO different to traditional Pali DO (12 links, starting with ignorance, from it fabrications, from it consciousness, from it name-and-form... and so on).

Cheers.


Malcolm wrote:
First, one has to distinguish the general theory of dependent origination from the specific theory of dependent origination. The general theory, stated by the Buddha runs "where this exists, that exists, with the arising of that,this arose". The specific theory is the afflicted dependent origination of the tweleve nidanas. There is however also a non-afflicted dependent origination of the path. For the most part, Madhyamaka covers the principle general dependent originationi order to show that all dependent phenomena are empty. Since, according to Madhyamaka, there are no phenonomena that are not dependent, the emptiness of non-dependent phenomena is never an issue, like hair on a tortoise or the son of a barren woman, since there are no non-dependent phenomena at all.

Nagarjuna however does discuss the twelve nidanas, ignorance and so on, in chapter 28 of the MMK.

The basis in Dzogchen is completely free of affliction, it therefore is not something which ever participates in afflicted dependent origination. Unafflicted causality in Dzogchen is described as lhun grub, natural formation. However, since there is causality in the basis, it also must be empty since the manner in which the basis arises from the basis is described as "when this occurs, this arises" and so on. The only reasons why this can happen is because the basis is also completely empty and illusory. It is not something real or ultimate, or truly existent in a definitive sense. If it were, Dzogchen would be no different than Advaita, etc. If the basis were truly real, ulimate or existent, there could be no processess in the basis, Samantabhadra would have no opportunity to recognize his own state and wake up and we sentient beings would have never become deluded. So, even though we do not refer to the basis as dependently originated, natural formation can be understood to underlie dependent origination; in other words, whatever is dependently originated forms naturally. Lhun grub after all simply and only means "sus ma byas", not made by anyone.

Rigpa is not a phenomena, it is not a thing, per se. It is one's knowledge of the basis. Since it is never deluded, it never participates in affliction, therefore, it is excluded from afflicted dependent orgination. However, one can regard it as the beginning of unafflicted dependent origination, and one would not be wrong i.e. the nidanas of samsara begin with avidyā; the nidanas of nirvana begin with vidyā (rigpa).

This denies a conventional usage based on valid relative cognition. Everyone knows what is meant by the term "mind." Everyone has one. When describing conventionally "what is this mind like?", then we use the term "nature of mind" to describe a valid object of negation for the purpose of either analysis or meditative investigation.

Now you are just uttering refutations for the hell of it -- without bothering to read context.

It was queried whether the nature of the mind could exist whether there was a mind or not -- but such an assertion has obvious flaws, like asserting wetness without water, or heat without fire.

As long as people are under the influence of the three poisons, for that long this sort of thing will never happen. You would better off abandoning libertarian social fantasies and focusing on the Dharma.

Buddha has already described how human beings devolved from a state of relatively peaceful anarchy. It all began when people began hoarding crops. As I said, states were created by a group of people to protect resources for common consumption. Corporations are formed by a group of people to exploit resources for personal consumption.

According to the Buddha, the first state was created in the form of a protection association, this is why the so called Kṣatriyas (protectors of the fields) with a rāja at its head, arose.

Anarchism is a form of political romanticism, as is libertarianism, as is my preferred pidgeon hole, deep ecology/left biocentrism.

I am a cynic. I do not believe that under present social and economic conditions, human beings are capable of living without governments. As a species, we are too afflicted to be able to treat each other with the proper respect idealist systems like anarchy, communism, and so on imagine we ought to behave.

I guess I am a Kali Yugaist at heart and regard such utopianism as pure romantic folly.

I've never had a Tibetan doctor tell me to fast/cleanse--- I've had them tell me many other things.. once I was told to definitely not have sex or drink alcohol when I was very depleted and couldn't digest food well. Is there a recommended season to do a cleanse from TM POV? And would you want to be in prime good health before attempting this? Is there a Tibetan version of a cleanse, rather than the "colorado cleanse" Is it good for anyone to do on a regular basis, or is there some sign that indicates you really need to do it...

Namdrol said:
Seasonal cleanses are recommended in the rgyud bzhi. But the Tibetans do not have the custom even though it is taught in the textbooks of Tibetan medicine.

The reason I recommend the colorado cleanse is that it is based on very sound Ayurvedic principles, and it is the one I personally use. The week long cleanse in the rgyud bzhi is fine, very simple, but, in my opinion, is a little too simple. It is for a time when people were less toxified in general.

Everyone, across the board, who is in reasonable good health, should so a cleanse in the spring and in the fall. Ayruvedic practitioners time it with two festivals, one that occurs in April, another than occurs in October. So that is when I do it to.

Acchantika said:
That which originates dependently is not "self-originated", "not created by anything whatsoever" etc.

Hayagriva said:
From Samantabhadra's prayer: The underlying basis is non-composite. It is an ineffable, self-arisen vast expanse named neither “samsara” nor “nirvana.” If just that is known, such is buddha; if not, such is a sentient one drifting through samsara. May every sentient one in the three realms know the ineffable fact, the basis.
I agree with Acchantika - this doesn't sound very dependently originated.

Malcolm wrote:
There are other texts in the cycle of the dgongs pa zang thal that define the basis further: The Second Vairocana aural lineage from the dgongs pa zang thal cycle claries this:

Since the basis was understood to be emptiness that has been forever cleansed, the path was not deluded by conceptual dualism. Since the result, the great wisdom expanded, the example of the great empty essence is “like space”. The example for the great luminosity of one’s vidyā is like the union of the sun and moon.

The way the Adibuddha arose: that latent basis is not established at all. When the time arrived, since that previously explained trio of vāyu, vidyā and space separated, the energy of space self-originated as kayās; the energy of vāyu self-originated as speech, and the energy of vidyā self-arose as mind. Since the body, speech and mind originated as self-originated from that basis that was not established in any way, compassionate vidyā did not engage in pride, object and mind were not separated into two. The mind that grasps external and internal did not arise, there was no clinging to the non-dual, he recognized his own face, severed mental proliferation, reversed clinging into dharmatā, instantly understood objects of knowledge, and since wisdom arise in himself, he fully awakened.

The point here is that the referred to basis is emptiness and it is not established in anyway at all.

Because the basis is emptiness, dependent origination is not contradicted.

The term dependent orgination is used differently in Dzoghen texts that in Madhyamaka. In Dzogchen texts it refers generally to post imuting ignorance state of six realms.

True, mind has of course dependently originated. But it's nature hasn't, has it?
And actually, the nature of mind, or Buddha-nature, doesn't ultimately really on the existence of mind I think.

Therefore, my position would be that all phenomena, and relative mind included, are both empty and dependently originated. And mind's nature is empty of any inherent existence, but has itself not dependently arisen. It actually is the ground within which dependent origination happens.

I must be one of the really slow ones, because I don't see where the above is wrong?

Malcolm wrote:
I was purely responding to your assertion that dependent origination does not equal emptiness. The two terms are in fact synonyms.

I nowhere stated that I negated the conventionlly observed efficacy of karma and its results, nor would I.

However, we can examine karma too if you like. Nāgārjuna states:

"Why? This action
does not arise from conditions,
and does not arise without conditions, 
therefore, there is also no agent. 

If there is no agent, 
how can there be an result which arises from an action?
If there is no result, 
where will a consumer be observed?

Just as the Teacher's emanation
is emanated through his consummate magical power,
if likewise the emanation also makes an emanation,
there is again a further emanation; 

in same the way, though that agent
performs an action, it has the form an emanation.
For example, it is like another emanation created by an emanation
making a [third] emanation.

Affliction, actions, bodies,
agents, and results
are like fairy castles
mirages, and dreams.

I take Nāgārjuna's view. All phenomena are completely equivalent with illusions.

If you say "DO is emptiness," it is just a convention, a label. That is different than saying, "DO is emptiness. The Tathagata is emptiness. Therefore, the Tathagata is DO'd, and is just a mere label in my mind." This reasoning reifies the conventional as truth. Then, a Madhayamakan has to show that no, she or he has not made the logical argument that DO is emptiness, and that DO and emptiness are just labels. So just because that which arises conditionally is labelled "emptiness," does not mean the Tathagata is an object which we called "emptiness." In fact, the Tathagata cannot arise conditionally, because that would mean that which has transcended impermanence would not have done so. A "Tathagata" has relinquished grasping at truth and falsity, and so having cut the root of samsara, is unarisen.

"I didn't say DO is not emptiness," because first off a Madhyamakan doesn't make claims, and second of all because this conventional parlance is convenient, like bowing to a Buddha photo, because you can't bow to the nonarising essence.

"None of them said DO is emptiness," because Nagarjuna explicitly stated that "empty" and "DO" are just a labels. The key point being these labels do not justify negating the Buddha, karma, etc., by claiming the Buddha is a mere imputation.

Is that what is called vase breathing in Tibetan Yoga and how do I reconcile the discrepancy with the earlier learned stomach breathing?

There was an attempt by Tibetans to translate the Mahāvibhaṣa, but according to tradition, only Bagor Vairocana was capable of finishing his section. This translation supposedly still existed as of early twentieth century.

That depends on a number of factors. Ojas can be lost with semen if a man's digestion processes are not good, if they are not eating well, etc. Other causes for the deterioration of ojas is stress, worry, poor habits such as staying up to late, not getting proper rest and so on. Also one is more likely to loose ojas with semen in the summer when one's diet is less nutrititous, less oily, lighter, rougher, and so on.

Mirrors don't think about reflecting images, they just reflect images. The same thing with the mind. It is just clear. That's all. That clarity is empty i.e. images do not belong to the clarity of the mind nor are they found apart from the mind. Moreover, that clarity of the mind itself is not established in anyway. It is not real. This principle can be known (rig pa) by the mind, but cannot be realized with the mind. This is why, in Dzogchen teadchings, the realization of emptiness and the so called "full measure of rig pa" occur at one and the same time. At that time your knowledge of reality becomes complete. Your rig pa, or knowledge has gone to its fullest extent. Then, after that, it is time to exhaust dharmatā.

I have the book compiling ChNN's teachings on the meaning of and how to make a Namkha. . in the introduction, it seems to imply this is primarily a Bon practice. Is this true? I was thinking of making one and getting it blessed by one of my Nyingma Lamas but if it is primarily a Bon thing he may not know much about it or even approve.. does anyone have any insight? The book alludes to similar practices being widespread among indigenous cultures around the world, which is interesting..

If it is mainly Bonpo, is there an equivalent and effective practice among Buddhists to harmonize the elemental energies of the individual?

No, thread crosses began as Bon thing and were adapted to Buddhist practice by Guru Rinpoche.

Sometimes [quite often] teachers will speak the level of their students, when their own view is in fact higher or different. Why? Because sometimes teachers realize that they must feed the truth to their students in small doses.

Some people, hearing that all phenomena are completely equivalent with illusions freak out. Some people who hear that phenomena are empty, freak out. This is why it is a bohdhisattva downfall to teach emptiness to the immature.

There are some cultural differences between Tibet and China, and the way "spirits" are understood is one of them.

AFAIK, while there are spirits or demons associated with most diseases, called "disease lords", they are not specific to a given organ, but rather govern a class of disease as a whole. Religious practice is always a component in any Tibetan medical treatment. So, the answer is yes and no. Yes in general, no on the specifics.

Quite literally, only "not killing". The five lay precepts as a total apply only to one's physical actions (speech being a physical action).

Basically, there are ten non-virtues: killing, stealing, sexual misconduct for the body; lying, harsh speech, calumny and gossip for speech; malice, envy and wrong view for the mind.

Of these, killing, stealing, sexual misconduct and lying are covered in the vows, as well as intoxicants, for a total of five lay precepts or vows.

I don't remember the exact details, but I believe what I heard is that there are 9 levels. I asked how many people have completed and was told that nobody has even passed the 3rd or 4th level (forgot). I think actually the words were that the highest level as of right now is 3rd or 4th and nobody has completed them. In other words, the other levels only exist theoretically, I guess, because they are not even written out or discussed since there are no students. I don't know. But, since SMS has been going on for quite a while and involves quite a lot of old hats at this stuff who have been sitting on their bums for quite a long time now chanting mantras, writing books translating Tibetan texts (Jim Valby), I just don't see the point of even attempting it. Why get involved in something nobody will ever likely finish?

Pero said:
Oh I see. Rinpoche hasn't taught more than the 4th level. Apparently it gets quite difficult after the second level. They are written out though. Sort of. There exists a booklet called Santi Maha Sangha (I got it in Merigar, didn't see it online) and in it all levels of SMS are outlined in the form of a poem. There you can see SMS is really something alive, it's really about your own practice developing. Looking at it, it seems to me that completing level 9 basically means achieving Rainbow body haha.

As for your question. Why do you concern yourself whether others will finish it or not? Why don't YOU try to finish it?

Sadly nowadays in China as elsewhere moxabustion is only used for cold and deficiency disorders. It used to be used for both hot and cold disorders as well as deficiency and excess disorders.

I mean only that in sems sde the central focus seems to be on a basic, unconditioned awareness that is free from duality, which, coincidentally, is the premise of Advaita and what "nondual" actually refers to, at least in the latter. That is where the perceived similarities end.

At the very least, I think it is understandable the two would be conflated by the uniformed. Like me.

Malcolm wrote:
One: bodhicitta in sems sde is not something that is considered real; cit is sat i.e. real in Advaita.

Two: there are two basic ways the term "non-dual" is used in Buddhism: free from subject and object perception (trivial) and free from ontic extremes (non-trivial).

Three, sometimes the word "non-dual" in translation is misleading. Here is an example from sem sde. This:

rgyu dang 'bras bu gnyis las 'das
sems can sangs rgyas gnyis med pas
sangs rgyas sems kyis sgrub ma byed

It might be translated as:
Beyond the duality of cause and result,
since sentient beings and buddhas are non-dual,
buddhahood is not accomplished with the mind.

But that translation would be a little wrong.

A better way to render it would be:

Beyond both cause and result,
since both sentient beings and buddhas to do not exist
buddhahood is not accomplished with the mind.

What is the difference you ask? Here there is a pair, a cause and a result i.e. sentient being are a cause, buddhas are a result. But since neither exist, therefore, buddhahood cannot be accomplished with mind.

These issues are often quite subtle.

Developing an understanding of the foundational teachings is important. Whether this is interpreted through a classical Indian Sarvāstivāda filter or a Theravāda filter is not so important. By the time of the classical period (i.e. the first few centuries of the common era) both of these exegetical systems had accreted to a point where they were unnecessarily complex. Old Guatama likely wouldn't have been very impressed with any of their large classical treatises.

There is no actual state or condition that is free from duality. If one should think that there is, one will have not understood one single thing about Buddha Dharma.

Because people think there is a real state free from dualistic extremes, they fall into the pit of eternalism and grasping, never even recognizing emptiness correctly, let alone realizing it, and hampering their understanding of dependent origination.

Thinking there is such a thing as a real state of non-duality is precisely the Advaita Vedanta, Trika and so on.

Malcolm wrote:
As Nāgārjuna states:

By relying on the conventional, the ultimate will be understood;
by realizing the ultimate, nirvana will be attained.

It is extremely important that key concepts be treated with care. It is also very important to avoid using language shared with other philosophical systems. I know any number of people who really are under the impression that there is really no difference between Dzogchen, Advaita and so on. And mostly, it is because of this pesky word "non-duality".

There is just as much danger of mental dulness and so with an eternalist view as there is with a nihilist view. In both cases, the conclusion will be reached that view is not important, karma does not matter, and so on.

Appearances are often deceiving.

While Tulku Thundup is certainly a qualified teacher -- he is not a native English speaker, I don't think he knows Sanskrit all that well, and he does not edit his own material.

As I said, gnyis med is certainly used frequently in Buddhist texts, but it should never be translated as non-duality, since it is missing the -ity part i.e. nyid or tā.

Because of imprecise translations there are many people indeed who think that basic message of Mahāyāna Buddhism, Zen, Dzogchen, Mahāmudra, and so on are exactly the same as Advaita. In particular this is demonstrated the by the convergance of Zen and Advaita in such teachers as Adyshanti, etc., and some of his students, such as Loach Kelley, who also has studied Dzogchen.

Crystal is a book taught by a Tibetan in Italian, not his native language, translated on the fly by someone without deep knowledge of Buddhism in general [Barry Simmons] and edited by John Shane, also someone without a deep knowledge of Buddhism.

While Crystal is one of my favorite books of all time, it is not without its flaws, and for this and that reason it was almost allowed to die. It was re-edited quite a bit, however, and has its present form. It is still not a perfect book in every respect.

I also know a lot of people in Dzogchen Community who are confused about the difference between non-dual and non-duality.

It is an important issue only because it is at the root of much confusion for so many people.

That reason why Norbu Rinpoche says this is because Dzogchen is predicated on an understanding of the human body that founded on medical ideas current in Tibet and India at that time.

In Dzogchen,the rtsal or energy of wisdom, ye shes, is specifically stated to be located in the brain. And the brain is specifically stated to be the organ that coordinates input from the five material sense organs. This is symbolized by the presence of the mandala of the 58 herukas in the brain, just as the eight consciousness are symbolized by the presence of the 42 peaceful deities in the heart.

Also, the two truths is not an important concept in Dzogchen, or as ChNN put it to me in person 19 years ago, "In Dzogchen there is only one truth, not two truths".

@ your previous post - Yes that seems to be the case - however the point with the four visions is that they are experiences that infer rather than embody. You have experience of what it is like but until the body passes away you don't embody 'the inconceivable'.

Malcolm wrote:
That is completely not true. If it were, the so called "great transformation body" ['pho ba chen po] would not be possible. Your view is more similar to the Gelug interpretation of illusory body i.e. one needs to discard this gross body at the time of death etc. Such a view is definitely not the view of Dzogchen.

The 4 visions are a body/brain-based simulacrum until the body passes.

A brain can't hold the knowledge of a buddha.

Why? This is a mere assertion on your part.

Why limit one part of a Buddha's sensory apparatus when you don't, for example, limit his tongue? A Buddha's tongue, according to reports, can see and hear. Why should a Buddha's brain be restricted to some limitation if the rest of his body is not?

The reason why buddhas are omniscient is that all objects of knowledge are illusory. Omniscience is not a function of memory addresses in a chip, after all. There should be no reason why having a human brain should limit a buddha at all. A buddha without a human brain however is an impossibility since possession of a fully favored human body with all senses intact and functioning is a defined precondition for awakening. It is also a defined precondition for receiving Vajrayāna empowerments. Why? If one's organs are damaged and incomplete, it is held that ones body mandala is incomplete and that one will not be able to fully awaken in a single lifetime via Vajrayāna methods.

The Hevajra Tantra states the following:

Vajragarbha asked: “This yoga of the completion stage,
its bliss is called great bliss,
completion is not a meditation,
so why do creation?”
The Bhagavan replied: “Incredible, the great bodhisattva
has lost the power of faith.
Where does bliss come from without the existence of the body?
Such a bliss cannot be spoken of.
Bliss pervades all migrating beings 
in the form of pervaded and pervader;
just as the fragrance present in a flower,
cannot be known without the flower’s existence.
In the same way, since form and so on won’t exist,
also bliss itself won’t be perceived.


The Vajrayāna view of awakening is that awakening is very much based in the body as this passage from the Hevajra Tantra shows. The key to awakening in Vajrayāna in general is embodiment. The mind/matter dualism (ala Decartes) we find in sutra is superceded in Vajrayāna, that is the key to why Vajrayāna is more rapid.

I'm going to sound really stupid, but I'm here to learn, so:

When Nagarjuna says that there is no existence, is he claiming that the Earth, universe, and multi-verses do not exist in the sense that they cannot be sensually experienced?  Or, is he, in a spirit of recognizing the universality of pratītyasamutpāda and sūnyatā, saying that the Earth, universe, and multi-verses do not intrinsically exist as such?

Malcolm wrote:
For Nāgārjuna, stating that things exist is a statement that they inherently exist.

Therefore, the only existence that Nāgārjuna was willing to grant phenomena was what we term a relative or nominal existence.

Nirmanakāya manifest to ordinary beings.

In a general sense, does the element of air ever perform the function of "pulling" per se?  I know air usually has to do with movement and that is has a quality of "pushing" (or is it displacing?) due to it's function of manifesting as pressure.

I know there is the downward-clearing wind in the body, and at other times other winds move "downward" but does the wind ever perform the function of "pulling", ie. acting as a force or in conjunction with other forces to pull something to a certain destination.  Pulling (attracting, bringing, causing something to tag along) it seems, would be different from pushing (repelling, moving something towards something else based on pressure exerted).

I ask this question because I am trying to understanding physics a little better (especially gravity as explained in Einsteins Theories) from the perspective of the elements.

When we have remove the afflictions that obscure our vision of reality, ordinary phenomena, including our own bodies, are revealed to us as compositions of dynamic light-energy and we become free of course matter since we no longer reify it.

This is possible because everything is empty, insubstantial and not real.

The Ayruvedic/Tibetan medical idea of rasayāna is that one does a week long cleanse; then one relies on a very pure diet combined with a rasayāna preparation like Chavayanaprash.

There is also a more "religious" idea of chulen, where one, having done a similar cleanse, relies on a practice such as White Tara, Amitayus, or Mandarava combined with special chulen pills.

Finally, there are yogic chulens that depend mainly on prāṇāyama exercises.

One can consider these outer, inner and secret rasāyanas. The use of these depends on one's health and needs.

It is nevetheless, the correct one, and the only one that rescues Nāgārjuna from the fetter of being accused of being a terrible logician. In fact, the caturskoti is not all that important in Madhyamaka -- too much of if it has been made by Western enthusiaists of Nāgārjuna.

In fact, the whole eight-fold negation of the mangalam is predicated on the fact that dependently arisen phenomena do not in fact arise, hence Nāgārjuna says of dependent origination: not ceasing, not arising, etc., when he praise the Buddha for teaching dependent origination.

Since phenomena do not arise , here again is a cascading negation of the other seven possibilities. If there is no arising, there can be no cessation, permanence, impermanence and so on.

In reality it is very simple, but if one should approach these texts with the wrong set of assumptions about language and so on, they will seem very strange and illogical. If you approach them with the correct set of assumptions about language (i.e. Nāgārjuna's) based on a close read of the texts in either Sanskrit or Tibetan, freed from the constraints of later Tibetan polemics or later Sino-Japanese Buddhist metaphysical speculations ala tathāgatagarbha, it is all very straight forward and somewhat boring.

It is perfectly logical when you understand the assumptions upon which it is drawing. Context is King.

yes, but that original assertion is not based simply upon assumption, the context was established through reasoning using the method of catuṣkoṭi - four members in a relation of exclusive disjunction - to which simple formal logic is inadquate.

The key phrase is "understanding of the parts requires understanding their relationship with the whole system" - a method used by the Buddha and by Nagarjuna to great effect, after all, why exclude the idea of dependent origination in the methodology itself?


Malcolm wrote:
The Caturskoti itself is based on assumptions about language and meaning, that is why it is failure when subjected to formal logic as a simple formal statement i.e. -(x, -x, x+(-x), -(x+(-x))).

However, the first statement (x) of the Caturskoti is not established, there is a cascading negation. This has to do with the linquistic parameters Nāgārjuna frames existence and non-existence in, in chapter 15 where he states quite explicitly that a non-existent is what people commonly call an existent that has changed its state into something else.

Original purity means that there has never been a time when the basis was ever stained in anyway.

I'm wondering, what makes a mantra particularly effective in treating physical imbalances?

If this is the case, then wouldn't Dorje Drollo or Vajrakilaya practice be just as effective?  Yet I know that accomplished Vajrakilaya or Dorje Drollo siddhas may still do vajra armor for "healing" purposes.

Another question is - in what case(s) is mantra sufficient alone for healing, and in what case(s) are physical medicines also required - how would a Tibetan doctor determine this?

You can use the mani for healing, if you are a mani siddha. All mantras ultimate can be used for healing. But some mantras have a specialized function for this, and Vajra armor is one such mantra.

When one dies and is reborn, are any imbalances in the wind, bile, and phlegm wiped clean and one starts again with these in relative balance, or does the imbalance that led to death ( assuming the death was due to disease) in some way carry on? IOW, does a propensity for a certain type of imbalance carry on from life to life? Any clarification on this issue would be much appreciated.

According to Tibetan medicine, imbalances in the three dośas, vata, pitta and kapha, come from the afflictions of desire, hatred and ignorance.

Of course, this suggests that a person has received teachings from a buddha in the past. Lacking that, one will never figure out the Dharma on one's own. Why? Because one cannot pull oneself out of samsara by one's bootstraps, as it were.

We can classify them by path as well, renunication, transformation and self-liberation.

Each vehicle is so called because it offers a complete path to liberation. One can attain the stature of an ārya through any one of the nine vehicles. In this respect, all nine vehicles stand alone and are independent from one another and may be taught as self-sufficient paths.

So, it is an error to assert that Dzogchen is a seperate vehicle, but the others are not. All nine vehicles have the necessary teachings to bring someone to the state of being an ārya.

Emptiness/Rigpa or Rigpa/emptiness your choice but always always always they are together...A genuine understanding of emptiNESS is required otherwise things don't fall into themselves - no collapse.

Malcolm wrote:
A proper understanding of emptiness is required, but not the realization of emptiness. If the realization of emptiness were required to have vidyā (knowledge of the basis), no one who was not an ārya on the stages could practice Dzogchen at all.

The realization of emptiness is also not a requirement for the basic requirement of tregchö i.e. stable placement in a momentary uncontrived awareness (ma bcos pa shes pa skad gcig ma). A proper understanding of emptiness is required.

Further, the experience of emptiness, while necessary, is not at all the same thing as realizing emptiness. The experience of emptiness is experiencing an awareness [shes pa] free of concepts, often referred to as recognizing the gap between two thoughts. If you follow the teaching of Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, terming this experience "dharmakāya", as some teachers do, is a big mistake. It is just an impermanent experience.

Well what does it result in?  I ask because Tsoknyi Rinpoche was excerpted recently and I read the entire question and answer series from the document that the excerpt came from and he says that Westerners have lung too high in the body and it needs to be brought down to just below the navel (the dan tien in Taoism/taiqi) and that as a result of lung Westerner's seem to be excitable and easily distracted but actually he's talking to people who already seem to know what the symptoms are so he doesn't go into that too much.

The reason he says it needs to be brought below the navel is that the natural location of vata in the body is in the pelvic region.

Malcolm wrote:
No. Not really.

However, sometimes we term the sincere wish to liberate beings from suffering (compassion) "bodhicitta", because cultivating the former inevitably leads to the latter -- since compassion is the seed of bodhicitta. Likewise, we frequently term non-buddhists of exceptional compassion "bodhisattvas" without meaning they are full bodhisattvas in the formal Mahāyāna sense.

It is important to make a disctinction between popular usage, and techincal usage. For example, some people call certain very strong forms of Marijuana "Buddha bud".

It is not the "-ism" or "-ist" that matters, but the understanding and practice.  Anyone, Buddhist or not, who practices the Eightfold Path well enough can become enlightened.

First of all, I believe that its highly speculative but I suspect the reversible effect if occurs, only lasts for a split second or less. In the book "Dzogchen practice", it was stated that the Adi-Buddha, Samantabhadra/Samantabhadri, experienced two of the three innate unelightenments at the start of universe and was able to overcome the delusions by the arising of His wisdom to recognize the eight appearances from the basis. Hence He retains his Buddhahood and become the Adi Buddha. And this might be the same event that happens to all Buddhas eventually if the Dzogchen tantras are to be believed.

Malcolm wrote:
There are three explanations possible, given that Dzogchen tantras and traditions definitely state that Samantabhadra was intiallly subject to either one or two ignorances (ma rig pa, avidyā):

1) The Dzogchen assertion that all sentient beings attain "full awakening (sangs rgyas)" at the end of a given mahākalpa requires interpetation and must not be taken literally.
2) Buddhahood is, up to a point, in fact reversible.
3) Buddhas and sentient beings newly form at the beginning of a mahākalapa.

All three possibilities present problems in terms of traditional Indian Mahāyāna Buddhology.

This controversy first came to my attention when my Sakya khenpo mentioned it in passing in the early '90's.

It is a trivial point because time is merely a convention. There is no time or continuity at all, other than conventionally. In Dzogchen, that which is shared with Madhyamaka can be considered trivial since we are not discussing something unique and specific to Dzogchen teachings.

Also the term "intrinsic awareness" is a translation misnomer that has, unfortunately, gained broad currency. Using the term "intrinsic awareness" for "rig pa/vidyā" is very limiting. First of all, the adjective "intrinsic is misapplied. Intrinsic describes a quality that something else possesses. For example, diamonds are intrinsically hard; gold is intrinsically shiny; water is intrinsically wet. [X] is intrinsically aware? The intrinsic awareness of what? Of what is awareness an intrinsic quality?

There are other problems to this translation which lead people to reify rigpa as some truly existing ground ala Advaita's brahman.

Sorry, when it comes to measuring the physical universe, we have a better understanding of it than ancient peoples.

In terms of eons, modern humans have only been out of Africa for 70,000 years or so.

The rest of it is religious speculation.

This of course does not mean that sentient life is confined to this planet, or that huge time frames mentioned in sutras are not relevant -- but there are issues with applying the fantastic numbers mentioned in sutras and so on to this planet and this crop of human beings.

On the other hand, it is fruitless to provide substitute speculations.

So we have to deal with two facts. Modern humans have only been present on the Indian subcontinent for at most 70,000 years. This fact stands in contradiction to traditional narratives about the history of Jambudvipa.

We should default to modern understanding, since it corresponds with the perception of ordinary people and is all that can be confirmed with any empirical certainty.

The beliefs of ancient Buddhist masters about the history of the world are pretty irrelevant.

Until that point, their "emptiness" remains an intellectual sequence of negations; accurate perhaps, but conceptual nevertheless.

The "recognition" of rigpa, which is simply the knowledge (rig pa) about one's state as a working basis for practice, does not require realization of emptiness as a prerequiste, and can't -- since if it did, no one could practice Dzogchen. '

In terms of the four visions, for as long as one continues to reify phenomena, for that long, one will never reach the third vision. This is the principal reason in modern Dzogchen practice, emphasis is placed on the basis through tregchö, rather the path, tögal. If you are a first stage bodhisattva and so on, then the four visions in Dzogchen will be very, very rapid. However, there is no gaurantee that one will realize emptiness merely through practicing tregchö. Of this reason then, practices such as tummo, etc. are also recommended.

I know south Indian food well, I have eaten it in India as well as regularly in NYC, being a vegetarian it is probably the tastiest veggie cuisine there is. However, between potatoes, basmati rice and various lentil dumplings, pancakes, and crepes

Malcolm wrote:
The crepes are fermented lentils and rice, 50/50.

Anyway, there is plenty of protein in that diet for most people.

The healthiest vegetarian cuisine is South Indian cooking. It is the most balanced, the most diverse, strong on rice and bean combinations, easy to digest.

It is not Vegan since no Vedic based diet can be.

With all the carbs and dairy though isn't it a bit fattening? I love this food but as I get older and the metabolism slows I need to think about slimming down. Also so many Lamas have diabetes now partially from the Indian white-rice obsession when genetically they are used to whole-grain barely (tsampa).

South Indian food is not necessarily carb heavy. The reason many Tibetans are getting diabetese is because they like the western diet.

Is then the initial recognition of rigpa equal to the path of seeing/first bhumi?

Also, is it accurate to describe this as recognition of clarity, whereas "realising emptiness" is effectively recognition of the inseparability of clarity and emptiness?

Malcolm wrote:
As to the first question, no.

As to the second question, yes.

As to the third question, realizing emptiness here in Dzogchen has the same meaning as realizing emptiness in any other mahāyāna school.

People think tribally. And as long as we continue to look different from one another, for that long people will continue to think in terms of "races" because race is a an effect of culture. "Race" is a result of attraction choices, environment, wealth, and a whole host of other things which result in non-verbal behaviorial cues. These behavarial cues are utilized in establishing human dominance patterns and social heirarchies.

Loppon, in Abhidharma kosha, are path moments mentioned?  If so do these consist of 16 actual consecutive moments?  Or would the path moment be just one moment in a mind door process series of sixteen moments, each other moment in the series performing it's own separate function?

I may be off base here because I am comparing what I have learned in the Theravada Abhidhamma to what you have said above.  However, even "path moment" maybe be understood very differently in the Abhidharma kosha,  I'm not sure. I would really like to know more.

I think that the one Buddha vehicle and the way of bodhisattvas can be very broad. That is how I envision them.

Malcolm wrote:
There is a great fault in being closed minded. There are equally great faults in being overly broad minded.

In reality, without the realization of the meaning dependent origination, one is not an awakened person. Dependent origination is solely the teaching of the Buddha. Yes it is true that some persons figure out dependent origination without the benefit of being taught by a Buddha. But such people do not teach.

Basically the rang stong/gzhan stong controversy is bullshit, and so is the prasangika/svatantrika controversy.

If you want to understand Madhyamaka, don't read Tibetan accounts of Madhyamaka dating after the 13th century. And here, it is better still just to rely on Indian masters. The sole exception to this is Khenpa Shenga's treatises, which are just Indian commentaries turned into footnoted annotations of root texts.
