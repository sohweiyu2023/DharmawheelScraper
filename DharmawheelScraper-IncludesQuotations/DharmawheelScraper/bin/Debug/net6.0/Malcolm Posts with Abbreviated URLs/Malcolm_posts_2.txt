The Ministry of the title is in fact a UN body, and the whole project could not work without it.
The book's model is more of a mixed system, with big government driving a partial shift from market economies and bureaucratic dictatorships (a better term for most "communist" governments) towards regionalism and local control with socialist elements.

If you mean totalitarian, then that’s not necessarily the case. Totalitarianism isn’t really needed for a socialist economy to function. There are specific reasons and causes why it did in Russia a hundred years ago and in China. Both of those countries were already authoritarian states where the authority to rule was already associated with wielding supreme power. Lenin’s “Dictatorship of the proletariat” was believed necessary (our stick is bigger than your stick) by populations that had never known democracy. But socialism isn’t a dogmatic religion. It doesn’t have to be Leninism. It’s a basic premise regarding the prioritizing of social welfare.

If you are genuinely interested in such issues I suggest you give Capitalism Alone a through read:

Johnny Dangerous said:
The fact that the entire globe now operates according to the same economic principles—production organized for profit using legally free wage labor and mostly privately owned capital, with decentralized coordination—is without historical precedent. In the past, capitalism, whether in the Roman Empire, sixth-century Mesopotamia, medieval Italian city states, or the Low Countries in the modern era, always had to coexist—at times within the same political unit—with other ways of organizing production. These included hunting and gathering, slavery of various kinds, serfdom (with workers legally tied to the land and banned from offering their labor to others), and petty-commodity production carried out by independent craftspeople or small-scale farmers. Even as recently as one hundred years ago, when the first incarnation of globalized capitalism appeared, the world still included all of these modes of production. Following the Russian Revolution, capitalism shared the world with communism, which reigned in countries that contained about one-third of the human population. None but capitalism remain today, except in very marginal areas with no influence on global developments.

Johnny Dangerous said:
Isn’t this state of affairs a plea for change in the socioeconomic system? Doesn’t it follow that we should ditch the world of hypercommercialized capitalism in favor of an alternative system? The problem with this otherwise sensible argument is that we lack any viable alternative to hypercommercialized capitalism. The alternatives the world has tried have proved worse—some of them much worse. On top of that, discarding the competitive and acquisitive spirit that is hardwired into capitalism would lead to a decline in our incomes, increased poverty, deceleration or reversion of technological progress, and the loss of other advantages (such as goods and services that have become an integral part of our lives) that hypercommercialized capitalism provides. One cannot hope to maintain these while destroying the acquisitive spirit or dislodging wealth as the sole marker of success. They go together. This may be, perhaps, one of the key features of the human condition: that we cannot improve our material way of life without giving full play to some of the most unpleasant traits of our nature. This is, in essence, the truth that Bernard Mandeville gleaned more than three hundred years ago.

Malcolm wrote:
Milanovic, Branko. Capitalism, Alone (p. 185). Harvard University Press. Kindle Edition.

He summarizes his book into five kinds of capitalism that are possible going forward:

Johnny Dangerous said:
Classical capitalism. Workers have income from labor only, capitalists have income from capital only, and all capitalists are richer than all workers, that is, the income distributions of workers and capitalists do not overlap. There is only very minimal redistribution via taxes and transfers. Interpersonal inequality is high. Advantages of wealth are transmitted across generations. This form is also called Ricardo-Marx capitalism.

Social-democratic capitalism. Workers have income from labor only and capitalists have income from capital only, but not all capitalists are richer than all workers. There is significant redistribution through the tax and transfer system, including free or accessible public health care and education. Interpersonal inequality is moderate. Relatively equal access to education allows intergenerational income mobility.

Liberal meritocratic capitalism. Most people have some income from both labor and capital. The share of capital income increases with income level, such that the extremely rich have mostly capital income. But the most affluent (say, the top 5 percent) also have substantial labor income. The increase in the capital share as societies get richer, and the association of high capital and labor incomes in the same individuals, translate into greater interpersonal inequality. The tax and transfer system redistributes a significant part of total income, but social separatism, whereby the rich prefer to invest in private education and health systems, becomes more important. Intergenerational mobility is less than in social-democratic capitalism.

People’s capitalism. Everyone has approximately equal shares of capital and labor income. People’s incomes still differ; some have more of both capital and labor income. Increased capital share does not translate into greater interpersonal inequality, so inequality does not have a tendency to rise. Direct redistribution is limited, but free health care and education help intergenerational income mobility.

Egalitarian capitalism. Everyone has approximately equal amounts of both capital and labor income, such that a large increase in the capital share does not translate into greater inequality. Interpersonal inequality is low. The role of the state in redistribution is limited to social insurance. Relative equality of incomes ensures equality of opportunity. Libertarianism, capitalism, and socialism come close to each other.

Malcolm wrote:
Milanovic, Branko. Capitalism, Alone (pp. 215-216). Harvard University Press. Kindle Edition.

He sees liberal meritocratic capitalism either evolving into people's capitalism or merging with political capitalism (the present trend):

Johnny Dangerous said:
The more economic and political power in liberal capitalism become united, the more liberal capitalism becomes plutocratic and comes to resemble political capitalism. In the latter, political control is the way to acquire economic benefits; in plutocratic, formerly liberal, capitalism, economic power is used to conquer politics. The end point of the two systems becomes the same: unification and persistence of the elites. Elites may also believe that they are able to run society more effectively by using the technocratic toolkit of political capitalism. A transition toward political capitalism could be boosted if young people became increasingly disenchanted by mainstream parties that follow more or less the same policies, and consequently lost hope that democratic processes could lead to meaningful change. The objective of political capitalism is to take politics out of people’s minds, which can be more easily done when disenchantment

There is no where to go. Blo 'das, beyond mind, simply means one has dropped thought for instant presence, it isn't a state beyond the mind, actually. It does not mean one uses a concept to counteract concepts--that's the path of renunciation and transformation. In the path of self-liberation, concepts have always been liberated in and of themselves since the state of concepts is nonarising. That is what it means to be in the state of ཨ. Deciding to make a sound is certainly is an intention, which is liberated in and of itself, but it is not necessarily working with the mind, for example, when one engages in an analytical investigation for the nature of the mind. The mind and nature of the mind are not mutually exclusive phenomena. When one has not recognized the nature of the mind; mind is in control it seems hard and solid; when one has recognized the nature of the mind, pristine consciousness is in control, because the mind is not hard and solid. For example, if you have tasted a piece of ice, you know that ice melts and becomes water. Even if all the ice is still frozen, you know it is water and you do not have to concern yourself any longer about the nature of ice.

Secondly, the whole point of his book is that capitalism won for a number of reasons, but not because capitalism and democracy go hand in hand. In fact, he makes the argument that autocracies may very well be more efficient and better suited to developing capitalist economies, because they do not have to suffer the inconveniences of laws and regulation. The principle issue he sees here, however, is that in the political capitalism of autocracies, there is infinitely more corruption than in liberal capitalist systems. But he also points out that the growing wealth gap makes autocracy more and more appealing to elites in liberal countries such as the UK and the USA:

ject said:
The two types of capitalism, liberal meritocratic and political, now seem to be competing with each other. They are led, respectively, by the United States and China. But even independently of China’s willingness to make available and to “export” an alternative political and, to some extent, economic version of capitalism, political capitalism itself has certain features that make it attractive to the political elites in the rest of the world and not only in Asia: the system provides greater autonomy to political elites. It is also attractive to many ordinary people because of the high growth rates that it seems to promise. On the other hand, liberal capitalism has many well-known advantages, the most important being that democracy and the rule of law are values in themselves and both, arguably, can be credited with encouraging faster economic development through promoting innovation and allowing social mobility, and thus providing approximately equal chances of success for all. It is the reneging on some crucial aspects of this implicit value system, namely a movement toward the creation of a self-perpetuating upper class and polarization between the elites and the rest, that represents the most important threat to the longer-term viability of liberal capitalism.

Malcolm wrote:
Milanovic, Branko. Capitalism, Alone (p. 46). Harvard University Press. Kindle Edition.

(2) Worker ownership through stocks, a policy Margret Thatcher endorsed, he points out, her "people's capitalism." (3) Inheritance taxes, which fund endowments to young people to give them a head start. With respect to labor: (1) investment in and standardization of public education; (2) a welfare system that everyone pays for and the elimination of private health care (3) immigration reform that permits temporary labor but mitigates citizenship applications and access to rights and privileges to state resources (i.e. your people can come work here, but you still bear the cost of their welfare).

Am I right? I mean, these are different, sure, but how crucial is the difference really? Especially since it is known in other adjacent systems for deities or quasi-historical gurus (I'm thinking in particular about Guru Rinpoche) to be conceived of as having been present primordially.

Malcolm wrote:
The principle is understanding the indestructible bindu in the heart center is the basis, as it is present in a sentient being. The purpose of all gurus yogas is based on this principle. That bindu is there all the time. We don't create that. It is not like generating a little Padmasambhava in the heart. When we do generation of a little Padmasambhava, or some other deity dissolving into and residing in our heart center, the principle is the same as Ati guru yoga. Ati guru yoga just skips all the gradual steps of finding oneself in instant presence in that state.

There are many visualization practices in Dzogchen teachings. None of them belong to Anuyoga. There are many visualizations in Anuyoga, very interesting practices for getting into the essence of all nine yānas, but these, while very useful, are not atiyoga practices, per se.

The real difference is that ati yoga is by definition not based on mind, but rather, pristine consciousness. That means working the radiance of rig pa directly. Ati guru yoga is one way of doing that, and is the main way of doing that in the DC. But in his kindness, ChNN taught so many practices of anuyoga, if people like or require these methods, they are available for people to use. But he always stressed that the main practice is AGY and SOV. So of course, sometimes I do a mahāyoga style guru yoga with Guru Rinpoche, other times, an anuyoga style with Garab Dorje, Vimalamitra, etc. But most of the time I do ati guru yoga, and of course, in the DC, rather than reciting lineage prayers, we always do Ati Guru Yoga first, before we do anything else, because for us, Ati guru yoga is the essence of all the lineages we have received, since it is the state of knowledge to which our gurus, all them, directly or indirectly, have introduced us to. Therefore, in our community, we unify everything in ati guru yoga and yes, this is also what I primarily teach. I don't really see much point in giving transmissions of many deity practices.

The point I am making is that he never accepted gzhan stong view, because it is trivial to say that the afflictions are not inherent to the mind, i.e., that the mind is inherently empty of afflictions, but not empty of its own purity, aka, luminosity. That's the point of his citation about sunrays, that they are inherently pure no matter what they fall on. Luminosity, in sūtra, is just a metaphor for purity. Unforunately, some people take this for being a substantial quality of the mind, and like you, confuse this with the notion that lamps illuminate themselves. Lamps cannot illuminate themselves, because there is no darkness in a lamp to remove.

Of course this is different in various tantric perspectives, where there is an understanding about how the radiance of this fundamental mind functions with the nadis, vayus, and bindus of the body and can be employed on the path.

It's also trivial to say that purity has infinite qualities, but some people out of a zeal born of literalism really do get too carried away.

It is ultimate in the sense that its object is ultimate, but it is relative in that it exists in a continuum. Since it is free of afflictions, it is beyond birth and death. But its activity is effortless and not connected with conceptual signs, which both Candra and Maitreyanātha agree on. As far as qualities go, as I have mentioned before, it is not necessary to have truly existing kāyas and wisdoms in the basis in order for the result to manifest qualities of the kāyas and wisdoms. The recognition of reality itself produces these qualities spontaneously. They are not newly created in the sense that they are fabricated; but rather, they are emergent properties of buddhahood, which cannot be inferred from observing sentient beings in their present state. Buddhas, of course see the actual potential of sentient beings, but statements that the buddha-qualities, such as eighteen unshared qualities and so on, exist in sentient beings, cannot be taken literally. But of course, once reality is realized through the personally realized gnosis that arises in equipoise, these qualities naturally emerge, because any being with a mind has the potential to manifest these qualities. For example, no one says that flowers exist in the ground fully formed. But no one denies that seeds exist in the ground. When these seeds meet the spring rain, by July all the flowers are in bloom. Likewise, the minds of sentient beings have the potential to realize reality—if you like the fundamental mind of luminosity, vidyā, etc.—and when they do, they bring forth an abundance of qualities, just as the Buddha has stated. But to take literally the idea that all these qualities exist fully expressed in sentient beings at the time of the basis is a pretty foolish position, since it is obviously the case that sentient beings are not omniscient, do not have the eighteen unshared qualities, and so on.

And we might add, from the MAV:

Since all the dry wood of objects of knowledge are burned up, 
that peace is the dharmakāya of the victors, 
at that time there neither arising nor cessation—
the cessation of the mind is directly perceived by the kāya.

Candra comments on this:


Since the kāya that possesses the nature of gnosis burns all the dry wood of objects of knowledge, since objects of knowledge do not arise, that which possess this nonarising is the dharmakāya of the buddhas. As it is said:

From this perspective 
the buddhas see suchness,
the guides are the dharmakāya,
dharmatā is not an object of knowledge,
that cannot be known. 

This dharmakāya neither arises nor ceases at that time. From this point of view, Mañjuśrī, this "neither arising nor ceasing" is nominal designation for the tathāgata."
 
That being the case, the relative presentation is that only the kāya can directly perceive the object of gnosis, reality, since the mind and mental factors can never engage that as a perceiving subject at all.

Rendawa's Jewel Lamp, 340-341 said:
According to the tradition of this tantra, the classification of the two truths is like this: all the phenomena of the incidental stains that arise from the confusing circumstances of ignorance are relative truth, because they obscure the perception of thatness and are reference points for total affliction. Because that is also not established as the object of a perfect primordial awareness, it is empty of self-nature, a nihilistic emptiness, and an inanimate emptiness. All the phenomena of luminosity, the nature of original mind, are absolute truth. And not because it has been proven able to withstand reasoned analysis ... It is the absolute because it is a nonconceptual field of experience. Because the incidental stains are absent, it is empty of other, and because it is experienced through a discriminating self-awareness, it is not a nihilistic emptiness and an inanimate emptiness ...

Because the emptiness of self-nature falls into the extreme of nihilism, its realization is not the perfect path of liberation; only the emptiness of other, the true nature of mind, luminosity, an immutable inner pure awareness experienced through the force of meditation and through a discriminating self-awareness, is accepted as the perfect path

Malcolm wrote:
First of all, as I have explained to you many timses, the spros bral tradition, the classical tradition of Madhyamaka in India and Tibet (as opposed to  yogacārins who merely claim to madhyamakas but cling to a real basis) is not a rang stong school.

Back to Rendawa, there is nothing novel about saying that the nature of the mind has never been affected by taints from the very beginning. His whole thrust is distinguishing mind from the nature of the mind, he says, when discussing the cause tantra on page 333, quotes the Bhadrapāla śreṣṭhi paripṛcchā sūtra:

Just as sun rays are not affected by the taints of bad odor, pollution, or even fallen corpses, the sun is free of bad smell without going somewhere else. Likewise, the element of consciousness [vijñānadhātu] is born in wombs of dogs and pigs, who eat shit and garbage, nevertheless, the element of consciousness is never affected by that inferior behavior."

It is perfectly acceptable to say that the mind is devoid of adventitious afflictions, the Buddha states it clearly in the Pabhassara Sutta. It that is all one is confining one's definition extrinsic emptiness to, this is not a source of fault.

The issue we run into is when we begin to define gnosis as ultimate. So does Rendawa really define gnosis as ultimate in the sense of being substantially different from consciousness? Rendawa, in the passage you cite says:

The two truths presented by the tradition of this tantra are as follows: All the adventitious, impure phenomena produced from the deluded condition of ignorance are obscurations to seeing reality (tattva, de kho na nyid), and because they are the support (ālambana) of affliction, they are relative truth. Because they also are not established as the objects of true gnosis (samyakjñāna), they are intrinsically empty, emptiness of annihilation, and an inert emptiness.

This all makes sense because the point being made here is that the emptiness of the mind itself is not inert, but afflictions and so on, which actually do not exist as such, are indeed empty in the way he describes them.

All the phenomena of luminosity of the fundamental mind (gnyug ma sems) are are ultimate truth. It is not because it can bear analysis through reasoning...

This is where Rendawa and Jonang part ways. He is not claiming that, in the parlance of the Geluk school, the fundamental mind of clear light can withstand analysis. He is making an entirely different point. What's his point: He cites the Abhidharmasammucaya on this score:

Why is [suchness] called "ultimate?" Because the ultimate is the domain of gnosis.

Rendawa continues:

As it says, it because it is the domain of the nonconceptual [gnosis], [the luminosity of the fundamental mind] is ultimate, and because it is devoid of adventitious stains, it is empty of other. Because it must be experienced in the manner of individual, personal knowledge (so so rang rig, pratyātma+vit), it is neither an annhilationist emptiness nor an inert emptiness.

It is incisive here that Rendawa makes the distinction the fundamental mind of luminosity cannot bear analysis. He does state that it is the domain of the gnosis that must be personally known (so sor rang gyis rig pa'i ye shes).

If one is familiar with Sakya works, one also finds Sapan making an observation in Treasury of Reasoning that partless moments are ultimate, and cannot be refuted by madhyamaka reasons. Why? Because madhyamaka only refutes moments with arising, abiding, and cessation. It has no arguments for dealing with partless moments. He also makes a distinction between an ultimate of freedom from extremes and an ultimate of reduction, with these partless moments belonging to the latter. We see the same move here. When reduced, the mind is empty of extraneous taints, as the Buddha states, so no one can argue with this. No one believes that afflictions are inherent to the mind. What Rendawa does not say is that this fundamental mind exists or is permanent, which is the error in which the Jonang seemingly fall, thus the charge of being crypto-Hindus. On page 332 he offers this refutation:

Here, others say, "The basis of purification, suchness with taints, and the result of purification, the vajrakāya, are inseparable in the manner of [one, the result] pervading [the other, the basis], once those are grasped to be the same, the inseparable basis and result are asserted to be permanent, stable, and the same This is totally deluded. The permanent cannot be contaminated by the condition of adventitious impurities, and due to this, also also the path will not be able to make the tainted untainted, because the permanent is unchanging.

The part in red I understand to be Rendawa's continued rejection of the Jonang perspective. So, frankly, I understand his "gzhan stong" to be rather different than yours, the so-called "white" gzhan stong mentioned by HHDL, as opposed to "black" gzhan stong.

They mock everything my religion stands for and casually show imagery and symbolism the devil, which is the ultimate evil in Christian mythology. They sell satanic clothes in stores and the world allows them to openly mock us. However I don’t even know what the right on how to deal with them, do I hate these people? Or is it even wrong to hate them? And if it is wrong to hate them then what do I do?.

To be honest I would just like advice from a Buddhist perspective. What would be the Buddhist way to deal with such disrespectful people and acts. What would Buddha tell his people to do if there were others whom disrespected everything he stood for and defiled his image? I know Buddhist have felt similar pains but in much, much worse ways as I know that some nations like Vietnam had points in their history where Buddhism was treated terribly. I just need help.

If you think that she is implying that Candra is hinting at an ineffable experience, I disagree with her. If you think she is implying that gnosis is ineffable, I agree with her.

The problem here is the lack of definition of “experience.” Is a direct perception an “experience?” We are generally unaware of the majority of direct perceptions we have. Generally, as I understand experience, direct perceptions are mediated by the apprehension and discursive identification of characteristics. What about all the other direct perceptions we have which never rise to the level of being identified? Are they experiences? How can an “object” which has no characteristics, unlike a blue vase, said to be experienced? A fundamental definition is that the ultimate is not a domain of mental experience.  To compound the problem, since pramanas and prameyas are mutually dependent, a valid cognition cannot be established independent of a valid object, and a valid object cannot be established independent of a valid cognition. This mutual dependence renders the notion of establishing object-oriented cognitions as ultimately valid problematic,

Can you explain to me which of the eighteen dhatus this “ awareness” belongs to?

stong gzugs said:
The part about phenomenology vs. ontology and Madhyamaka making a category error is what's crucial. In the conversation between Śankara and Madhyamaka, attempting to situate awareness within one of the dhatus is trying to win the argument by terminology, because by definition the dhatus are knowable things. So this rhetorical move has to be rejected a priori. So awareness, as Duckworth is describing it using a non-partisan term, is something we can all experience, is our subjective sense of being an active witness to experience rather than being a zombie. What's the difference between subjective experience when you're waking, vs. when you're put into a coma? A sense of awareness.

That sense of awareness can be treated both as subject (as it's the one who is witnessing events) and object (as we can talk about it, albeit imperfectly, like we're doing here). Attempts to refute it as an object through arguments are themselves witnessed by it as a subject. Whether you privilege the arguments that refute it as an object (ontology) vs. the experience where you are yourself aware of that argument (phenomenology) is a matter of starting assumptions. Fact is, perhaps aside from nirodha samapatti, the phenomenology of awareness always remains, no matter what sort of Madhyamaka analytical meditation you do. You can collapse the sense of self in the skandhas, but that collapsing appears within spacious awareness. Otherwise, there would be no actual recognition of no-self-in-skandhas.

krodha said:
This is why the soteriological catalyst for liberation in Madhyamaka, atiyoga and so on is rooted in epistemology, rather than this stringent division between phenomenology and ontology that you are continually proposing.

The phenomenological aspect of our experience is already corrupted by the deluded perception of ontological constructs. Madhyamaka, atiyoga and so on are stating that via accurate epistemic insight, ontologies are undermined and this releases the phenomenological, conscious aspect of our experience from the confines of all dualisms. Even beyond the limited species of nonduality you are advocating for which is an awareness devoid of subject and object. That too is refuted, as we see in Atiśas writings that are echoed by prominent atiyogins such as Longchenpa et al., dharmakāya does not even admit jñāna, and so on. Jñāna ceases to operate. The purpose of that clarification is to undermine attempts at reifying that phenomenological aspect, like you are doing.

You are an advocate of a substantial and reductive nonduality, which is a deviation. True nondual insight, is insubstantial and nonreductive. This is the meaning of the emptiness of emptiness and so on. Your view errs very close to the edge of tīrthika treatments of that phenomenological aspect.

And I will follow Patsab, who with Mahāmati, translated the text according to its meaning, where rūpa was in this case rendered rang bzhin. Translating things directly from Sanskrit is good, but there is a risk of ignoring what the pandita/translator teams understood the correct meaning to be and overruling them out of literalism.

Also, Majya, Patsab's student, summarizes the passage quite well.

In any case the term proliferation is quite well understood, it means there is no conceptual reification of ontological choices, being, nonbeing, and so on, since those choices are not valid.

She addresses your interest here:

https://www.academia.edu/5778953/Knowin ... Perception, especially pp. 156:

For him, at the time of perception of the ultimate, of the emptiness of things that were never really there in the first place, inasmuch as there is nothing whatsoever to be perceived, that is, since an object for consciousness does not exist, consciousness will simply not come into being; Candra-kī rti’s assertion that consciousness assumes the mode of non-arising translates into no consciousness at all. Yet in this way consciousness still fulfills the Sautrāntika demand that the consciousness resemble, conform to, its object: like its object, the non-arisen true nature of things, consciousness “takes,” so to speak, a non-arisen and non-existent form. In Candrakīrti’s words: If consciousness, like its object, has the form of non-arising, it is proper to maintain that it has proceeded by way of the object just as it is. And given its proceeding by way of its object, its conforming to its object, it is proper to designate it direct perception.

ChNN stressed that there is no such a thing as "pure Dzogchen," contra the ideas of some. On the other hand, he also stressed over and over again that Dzogchen was not just some add-on to Vajrayāna, even though this is how most people in Tibetan Buddhism relate to it.

Dzogchen is an independent vehicle. He often pointed out that each of the vehicles were independent paths, complete in themselves. For example, everyone understands Śrāvakayāna and Mahāyāna are a complete path. No one says, "To complete the path of śrāvakyāna, you must practice pratyekabuddhayāna, etc., or to complete the Mahāyāna path, you must then practice kriya tantra." Mahāyāna is a complete path, so is kriya tantra.

This does not mean it is invalid for Dzogchen tantras and texts, like the Great Space of Vajrasattva, to point out the deviations and errors of the eight or nine vehicles. Because understanding those deviations and errors is important for discovering one's primordial state and not having doubts.

But, even still, if you read Cāndrakīrti's Prasannapadā closely, he doesn't necessarily refrain from making positive statements about yogic perception. In commenting on MMK 25.6, he says that jñana has a form (rūpa) which he describes as transcending all multiplicity (sarvaprapañcātīta)...

I mean has Cāndrakīrti ever offered any account of what the (non)experience of jñana is, that you know of?

Gnosis also is not an experiencer. Since (1) gnosis necessarily perceives emptiness, and (2) that [emptiness] has nature of nonarising, as nirvana is not an existent through that nature not existing, and is also not held to be a nonexistent, therefore, the nature of gnosis is beyond all proliferation.

He never says gnosis has a form (rūpam, gzugs) in this passage. He also denies that gnosis is an experiencer.

Majya states:

Gnosis— the subject (viṣayin, yul can) [which apprehends] the ultimate—does not perceive any signs of proliferation because it does not apprehend [nirvana] to either exist or not exist.

But this gnosis is relative, like all gnosis. Otherwise, one has to theorize a) a separate instrument of knowledge for gnosis, which the Buddha never taught, or b) a transformation of the state of consciousness from being compounded to being uncompounded, as the cittamatrins suggst, which contains an internal contradiction or c) that consciousness itself is ultimate and truly established, contra the Buddha's teachings in their entirety.

stong gzugs said:
The part about phenomenology vs. ontology and Madhyamaka making a category error is what's crucial. In the conversation between Śankara and Madhyamaka, attempting to situate awareness within one of the dhatus is trying to win the argument by terminology, because by definition the dhatus are knowable things.

Malcolm wrote:
If one cannot situate “awareness” among the dhatus, then it is a nonthing, and unknowable, other than as an erroneous imputation, that’s the point.

stong gzugs said:
So this rhetorical move has to be rejected a priori. So awareness, as Duckworth is describing it using a non-partisan term, is something we can all experience, is our subjective sense of being an active witness to experience rather than being a zombie. What's the difference between subjective experience when you're waking, vs. when you're put into a coma? A sense of awareness.

Malcolm wrote:
So, now you are taking awareness as an object. Which means one’s sense of being aware is relative and conditioned.

stong gzugs said:
That sense of awareness can be treated both as subject (as it's the one who is witnessing events) and object (as we can talk about it, albeit imperfectly, like we're doing here). Attempts to refute it as an object through arguments are themselves witnessed by it as a subject.

Malcolm wrote:
Which means “awareness” is a mental factor, which is part of the dharmadhatu, the object of the element of mental consciousness and the mental organ, thus conditioned and not a separate instrument of knowledge.

Kai lord said:
Well according to Yonten Cyamtso:
According to the argument of direct perception, the indivisible nature of the two truths is beyond the scope of intellect, for it is understood through the direct perception of self-cognizing awareness, by way of an objectless self-illumination. The self-cognizing awareness referred to here indicates self-cognizing primordial wisdom. The inseparability of the two superior truths is the fundamental nature of all phenomena, for the Noble Ones have perceived it so, just as a healthy person sees the whiteness of a white conch shell. The Ocean Tantra says:

With in the self-born, self-arising mind,
These two are not divided.
Clearly perceived, this cannot be denied
With in awareness, unborn, self-cognizing.
This is said to be the highest of all realizations.
This points to the final conclusion: the indivisibility of the two
truths is by definition beyond the ordinary intellect.


To practice the Mantrayana path after one has, by means of these four arguments, attained certainty in the inseparability of the two superior truths, is of the highest moment. The inseparability of the two truths, just as it is, cannot be assimilated through intellectual analysis alone. Nevertheless, it is through inferential investigation that one can come to a perfect certainty that such must be the case. Then, by dint of pursuing the path of meditation, it is possible to come to a direct realization of the fundamental nature of things.

An assumption being stated as a fact. I mentioned this above, that your claim here rests on whether one's assumed starting premise accept reflexivity or not. Cāndrakīrti doesn't, Dharmakīrti does, [/quote]

Dharmakirti nowhere states there is a subject in absence of an object. What he states is that objects of direct perceptions are disclosed to the mind through the intrinsic cognizance of the mind in second order  perceptions. It is false to say Candrakirti does not accept reflexivity, he does, albeit as memory.
Śankara does.
It’s quite questionable that  svaprakasha intends is the same thing svasamvitti intends.

As such, from within Vedanta's own terms (like I said, (a) favoring experience (or phenomenology to use Duckworth's terms) over conceptual arguments (or ontology, per Duckworth) and (b) accepting reflexivity of awareness), I think Śankara's refutation of Madhyamaka's no-self argument makes perfect sense. Madhyamaka's responses (and thus yours) are only acceptable if you already buy into the premise that favors ontology over phenomenology, which Vedanta doesn't. So, as I said, everyone's arguments only work from within their own starting premises, which are always assumed and never proven.
Well, there are those who would gladly toss rview in the garbage, who imagine that realization does not depend on view. But such people are mistaken.

Malcolm wrote:
My refutation of Advaita is its inability to provide a convincing ontological status for maya that isn't dualistic. (There are somewhat parallel problems in the way that some Buddhist accounts treat ignorance as a causal factor at the start of the chain of dependent origination, as it also is on murky grounds in terms of its ontological status.)
People who properly study abhidharma done make that error


We conventionally term the wisdom (prajñā) that apprehends emptiness free from extremes a "yogic direct perception,"  but this merely a convention, since there is no object that is directly perceived, and thus, no actual direct perception as such. In this state the mind simply subsides through the exhaustion of analytical options and merges into the dharmadhātu. This is not an "experience" per se, since there is neither subject nor object—the mind has become the very image of the dharmadhātu free from all extremes, like the reflection of the blue sky in a still lake.
Again, Cāndrakīrti's take on yogic direct perception differs from that of others and is a source of debate.
This is standard madhyamika. The difference between Candrakirti and others is only pedagogical, not substantive.

But, even still, if you read Cāndrakīrti's Prasannapadā closely, he doesn't necessarily refrain from making positive statements about yogic perception.
That’s because we have to use language, as, limited as it is.

The fault of the Gelukpas is turning emptiness into a conceptual object.
Agreed. "Emptiness cures all wrong views, but the view of emptiness is incurable."
emptiness has a form
Of course emptiness has a form. Everything that has form is empty. That’s why I want to bracket the discussion on shunyatabimba, so called wisdom appearances. Those forms you refer require yogic technique to expose.

The special point of view of the Dzogchen tradition is that the three lower empowerments are unnecessary, the fourth empowerment alone is sufficient for ripening the student. The four Dzogchen empowerments-elaborate through very unelaborate-are in fact elaborations of the fourth empowerment.

What we call “direct introduction” is just the most simple way of conferring the word empowerment.

There is also something similar in the Kagyu Mahamudra tradition.

Garab Dorje never said; "If you don't get it, do semdzin and rushan",  he said; "recognise your own nature". So since he didn't say exactly how we should "recognise your own nature" all options are possible as long as you connect with a qualified teacher and actually recognise your own nature. Also, Dzogchen empowerments abound with visualisations of deities and so a capacity for visualisation seems to be indicated in order to fully participate. This goes for Semde, Longde and Mengakde. At least the ones I got.

Malcolm wrote:
Garab Dorje very precisely explains how to recognize your own nature in many texts.

Dzogchen transmission does not need to happen in the context of a formal empowerment. Sometimes that method can be used. But it is not necessary, but it can be useful for some.

As to  empowerments, longde for example depends on an empowerment of Ngondzog Gyalpo because Dzeng Dharmabodhi combined this Anuyoga empowerment with the Longde instructions. But prior to him there was no such Longde empowerment. The man ngag sde lower two empowerments are also influenced by Anuyoga. Tibetans, ChNN explained, like empowerments, and don't really take things seriously unless there is an empowerment. I have also see this attitude among western students. They receive transmission of guru yoga, which gives them permission to practice all Dzogchen methods, or even practice transformation practices with a simple lung transmission, but they are not happy and they want to participate in a complicated ritual. Sometimes, there is a very good reason to give an empowerment in a more elaborate style, but that depends on circumstances. My main point, is that we should make the same distinction Longchenpa does:

On Thursday night and into Friday morning [9/19/13 and 9/20/13], our local staff began noticing an increasing number of calls for a protest downtown on Saturday [9/21/13]. It started when Mustafa Nayem, a young Kyiv-based journalist born in Kabul, wrote on his Facebook page, “Come on guys, let’s be serious, don’t just ‘like’ this post. Write that you are ready and we can try to start something.” Receiving an overwhelming response, he suggested that young people upset with Yanukovych’s abrupt U-turn meet downtown at Maidan. This is when I read the word Euromaidan for the first time in Facebook messages our staff forwarded to let us know what was circulating on social media. Its meaning was immediately clear—a pro-European version of the frequent protests on Kyiv’s most important square. While the word Maidan literally just meant “the square,” it was frequently associated with political protest. Protests there in 1989 and 2001 preceded the massive Orange Revolution protests on Maidan in 2004.

As a result of the Euromaiden revolt, Yanukovich fled to Moscow February 21, 2014. He was ousted on 2/22, and a new government was formed.  Russia invaded Crimea on 2/27/2014. So yes, the Russian invasion was directly related to the suppression of Ukrainian ambitions to join the EU.

You really should read this book, as Smith was working at the US embassy during the entire time and it is a living witness. He provides a detailed account, and:

ject said:
“So, a lot is happening in Ukraine right now,” the Russian continued, finally getting more to the point. “What really interests me is this—does your government seek the removal of Yanukovych? Is that a US goal?” “No,” I responded, unequivocally. “We’ve had our share of issues with the Yanukovych government, and are very concerned about the corruption in his team. But he was democratically elected, and he should leave according to the ballot box as well. We’re not in the business of seeking the ouster of democratically elected leaders.”

I said this because it was true. While the lengthy record of US interventions in Latin America will forever be cited by those seeking to label the United States a serial meddler, I wasn’t working for the Eisenhower administration. I had seen no evidence that anyone in the US government was interested in taking heavy-handed actions of any sort in Ukraine. On the contrary, Yanukovych’s corruption caused a disappointed Washington to step back from the relationship and increasingly ignore Ukraine. No one wanted to get more involved. We didn’t want to break it; we didn’t want to buy it. Wishing the Ukrainian people well, we just wanted the Ukrainian government to get its act together at last.

The Russian diplomat and I spoke for about a half hour. No one interrupted us or attempted to join the conversation. Even assuming that my every word would be quickly reported back to Moscow, I didn’t find it difficult to engage him, but nothing I said even mildly dented his paranoid conviction that the United States was somehow driving Euromaidan. I knew that was not the case. Our truthful message to Moscow and everyone else was one and the same. When our inconclusive conversation finished, Maksimov brought everyone together for one more toast, then broke up the event.

As an approach to certain phases of some close retreats, yes indeed, but as a description of the path, I'm not so sure. If anyone can offer references to acknowledged, non-mythical, living dzogchen practitioners who do not and have not practiced extensive sadhana I will be very interested.

Crude fetishization of "direct introduction"? What do you mean by this? We need DI before we can practice dzogchen, so it's crucial.

As far as living dzogchen practitioners who "do not and have not practiced extensive sadhana" I'm guessing you won't find too many who 'have not' ever practiced sadhanas etc but probably quite a few who 'do not' anymore or do not for a time. It's a thing. It's in the literature.

But as ChNN stated, and as it bears repeating, Garab Dorje never said do 100k of this and that, he said first, "encounter your own state" aka direct introduction, "ngo rang thog tu sprad."

His take on Madhyamaka is in the Brahma Sutra Bhasya, as I mentioned to Kai Lord above.
As to your other question, from my reading, Śankara and most Hindu critics of Buddhism primarily emphasize problems with the radical doctrine of momentariness, which makes it hard to explain many important functions of human memory. They found Dignaga and Dharmakirti way more interesting interlocutors than Nagarjuna for such reasons as you mention. Namely, to summarize their argument, because the atman is defined in Vedanta as incapable of being objectified (as it is always the witnessing awareness and never the object of awareness being witnessed), and anything you can refute through analytical meditation is necessarily an object of awareness, you can't refute the atman using Nagarjuna's methods. So, the kind of self that can be refuted is one that Advaita doesn't accept anyways (the five skandhas, the pudgala, the koshas, the ahamkara, the dualistic manas, etc.) Śankara offers this as a critique of Madhyamaka in the Brahma Sutra Bhasya, which if I recall correctly, basically tosses a moment of self-inquiry into the mix. You do some sort of analytical meditation to realize no-self, and then Śankara pops up and says "And to whom did this realization occur?" If the awareness that realized no-self exists, then this is what is meant by the atman, and if the awareness doesn't exist, then the realization is impossible.

I mean, kinda. Cāndrakīrti calls it of expedient meaning, so he can interpret away the parts that conflict with his worldview. Ratnākaraśānti points out flaws in his understanding of cessation and, as I've been saying, the 8th Karmapa, Mikyo Dorje, explains why, the "we have no view" is simply a rhetorical cover-up.
Candra cites the Lanka, where tathāgatagarbha is described as a salve for those afraid of emptiness. Commenting on the same passage, since the Lanka identifies the all-basis consciousness with tathāgatagarbha, Jayānanda notes that here, the ālaya should be understood to be emptiness, and consciousness, to be the consciousness that apprehends that emptiness. This is why the Sakyapas maintain, contra the Gelukpas, that the all-basis consciousness is actually acceptable to Prasangikas.


Unknown said:
Candrakirti and others identify the [fact that] the nature of phenomena is not seen by the ultimate nature of phenomena as “seeing ultimate reality.” However, let alone speaking of this as the ultimate, they would have to accept many contradictions in their own systems even in terms of words [on the level] of seeming [reality]. Therefore, in order to eliminate this flaw, they say, “We Madhyamikas have no assertion whatsoever.”

You express a lot of doubt about how people in the DC practice and you are very discouraging to others. In general, Dzogchen is not so hard. It does not take nearly as much effort as some people claim it does. Norbu Rinpoche was an extremely encouraging teacher. He never discouraged anyone. He made sure that everyone had the possibility of liberation through Dzogchen teachings, at the very least, liberation in the buddhafields. He didn't believe in the two accumulation model of attaining buddhahood. He told us to discover our primordial state right now, which is already perfect, and if distracted, recognize it again and again and again, practicing Ati Guru yoga constantly day and night, giving ourselves direct introduction constantly. If we have time for more elaborate practices, great. But if not, also no problem. He also said that understanding was more important than meditating--this is key point that differentiates Norbu Rinpoche's approach from other teachers. One won't expose rig pa by meditating sadhanas, etc. Longchenpa is extremely clear about this. If someone has a good understanding, then whatever they do becomes Dzogchen practice. If someone has no understanding, then even practicing Thigle Gyacan or Chetsun Nyinthig will never become Dzogchen practice no matter how many pretty words those sadhanas contain. I know you know this and agree, so lighten up please.

Malcolm wrote:
This is just not the case. You've already admitted that there are no extremes of existence to be found in the ultimate, and that āryan equipoise is free of proliferation of extremes, well, since there are no extremes found in ultimate analysis. If there was something to find, there might be a fault, but since you already admit there is nothing to find, you are just being attached to words and concepts. The Uttaratantra comments on cessation:

I bow to the sun of the Dharma, that which is not nonexistent, nor existent, not both existent and nonexistent, and not other than existent and nonexistent, which cannot be analyzed, is undefinable, to be personally known, peaceful, endowed with the light rays of immaculate gnosis, which destroy attachment, aversion, and confusion with regard to all objects.

This is the inexpressibility personally-known gnosis that one discovers through systematically going through the four extremes. As the Uttaratantra continues:

Unthinkable, nondual, nonconceptual, 
pure, clear, antidotal, 
free of attachment, freeing from attachment, 
having the characteristic of the two truths.

Freedom from attachment includes
the truths of cessation and the path,
according to the proper sequence,
to be known through the three former and three latter qualities. 

Because it can't be analyze conceptually, nor expressed, 
because it is known by the āryas, because it unthinkable, 
because it is peace, without the two, 
like the sun, with the trio of purity, so on.

In sutrayāna, this can only be discovered apophatically. I mentioned before that the Uttaratantra and Candra are perfectly consistent with each other, and indeed Longchenpa does just that throughout his commentaries, as does Gorampa.

As Nagārjuna states, the dharma of the Buddha is the two truths. There are not more than two truths. The ultimate truth is inexpressible, beyond all extremes. It is arrived at by negating the extremes one by one and by no other way, because the profound emptiness of Mahāyāna is freedom from four extremes.

KTGR said:
"...many Shentong masters criticize the Prasangika Madhyamikas for their claim that they do not hold any views. In the opinion of these masters, Prasangikas just dodge the issue because they refute everyone else's views and then avoid the refutation of their own views by claiming not to have any."

As I alone have no position, I alone am not guilty.

When it comes to sutra and lower tantras, up to the level of Hevajra and Kalacakra, my opinions are pretty much inline with Sakyapa.

In another lighter moment, as separatists demanded a referendum on Donetsk joining Russia, a group of local residents declared that they would have another referendum the same day to ask whether Donetsk should join the UK. Donetsk is a town with an interesting history, and there was a reason why these jokesters chose the UK. It was initially founded in 1869 by Welsh industrialist John Hughes, whose statue stands in the city center. To mock the separatists and their slogans, such as “Glory to Russia!” and “Donetsk is a Russian City!” the group posted slogans such as “Donetsk is a British city! God Save the Queen!” It was a clever parody, but parodies alone weren’t going to beat the well-funded guys

Smith, Christopher M.. Ukraine's Revolt, Russia's Revenge (p. 321). Brookings Institution Press. Kindle Edition.

And:

Donetsk separatists announced that they were preparing to hold a referendum on May 11 with a single question, “Do you support the creation of the Donetsk People’s Republic?” There was no clarity about whether this was a “republic” within Ukraine, as the “Crimean Republic” had been for many years within Ukraine, something more independent, or just a pit stop on the road to Russian annexation. The complete lack of clarity about the goals of the separatists also pertained to the other great question about them: Who the hell were they? These were not even marginal political figures; they were not political figures at all on the local scene. People such as self-declared “Donetsk people’s mayor” Denis Pushilin and his counterpart in Slovyansk Vyacheslav Ponomaryov had never even been players in local politics before. They materialized out of nowhere with the help of the anonymous but heavily armed “little green men.” Without their foreign military backers, it would be doubtful that anyone would ever have heard of them.

Longchenpa states:

Within this dhātu that has always been naturally perfected,
samsara is Samantabhadra, nirvana is Samantabhadra,
but there is never been samsara or nirvana in the dimension of Samantabhadra.
Appearance is Samantabhadra, emptiness is Samantabhadra, 
but there is never been appearance or emptiness in the dimension of Samantabhadra.
Birth and death are Samantabhadra, happiness and suffering are Samantabhadra, 
but there is never been happiness and suffering or birth and death in the dimension of Samantabhadra.
Self and other is Samantabhadra, permanence and annihilation are Samantabhadra, 
but there is never been self and other or permanence and annihilation in the dimension of Samantabhadra.

He comments:

Since vidyā bodhicitta has never been established in the space-like essence, whatever appears such as samsara and nirvana, appearance and emptiness, birth and death, happiness and suffering, self and other has never been established. Since those appearances as a mere state, potential, or play self-appear without ceasing and due to the absence of inherent existence in appearances—like illusions, dreams, moons in the water, optical illusions, fairy castles, and emanations—all phenomena of samsara and nirvana have never existed from the moment they appear, are baseless, and never move from transcendent state of Samantabhadra and Samantabhadri.

That includes all your qualities. Longchenapa's two favorite Indian treatises to cite from are the Uttaratantra and the Madhyamaka-avatara. He often cites them side by side.

Unknown said:
“All views of emptiness are a source of error.”

It isn't, no more than pointing out the error of asserting hair on tortoises is view.


Unknown said:
Gorampa's "Jonang is eternalist, Geluk is nihilist, the middle way is between them" isn't exactly groundbreaking stuff. Plus Gorampa's critiques of Jonang are basically derivative of Rendawa. He should have studied Dölpopa's Mountain Dharma more closely, particularly the section that distinguishes between absolute and relative Cittamātra.

Malcolm wrote:
Gorampa was the person who originated this distinction. So, at the time, ground breaking. And no, his critiques do not come from Rendawa. The extant translation out there has a translation error. The text, translated by Geshe Jamspel, incorrectly identifies Rendawa's critique of gzhan stong as the one Gorampa favors, when in fact it is the more gentle criticism leveled by Rongton he favors. I received this teaching directly, so I am quite certain this the translation you have is mistaken here. Rongton's more gentle criticism labels gzhan stong an intermediate view between false aspectarian yogacāra and proper madhyamaka. Gorampa in fact devotes very little time to gzhan stong in Moonrays, mostly because in the end gzhan stong pas basically agree with the approach to meditative equipoise free of proliferation found in classic Madhyamaka, despite whatever other erroneous claims they make.


Unknown said:
Pelden Dorje also says the differences between Jonang and Sakya aren't about the ultimate like Gorampa says, but about the conventional.

Malcolm wrote:
Then he did not read Moonrays very carefully. What Gorampa states very clearly in his summation of critiques of Jonang is this, quoting Jetsun:

“If it is said ‘…there is existence in the ultimate,’ now then, because of falling into the extreme of existence, it will not be path of madhyamaka. But if it is said ‘…you assert non-existence in the ultimate, also you fall into the the extreme of non-existence,’ because we never established existence in the ultimate, we do not assert nonexistence."

Now then, if it is asked ‘…what do you assert?’ However things exist in the relative, we assert them as such, and hence we are freed from the extreme of annihilationist view in the relative. Since there is nothing whatever to assert as ultimate, since we are free from all extremes we are called ‘Mādhyamikas.’”

In other words, the basic point here is that if there were something truly established as ultimate, it should be seen in the equipoise of an ārya, but since nothing is perceived in the equipoise of an ārya according to any of the four extremes, being totally free of proliferation, there is nothing to assert as ultimate in post-equipoise. This is quite different than asserting the ultimate is "rang stong" or "gzhan stong." This brings us back to Longchenpa:

Since vidyā bodhicitta has never been established in the space-like essence, whatever appears such as samsara and nirvana, appearance and emptiness, birth and death, happiness and suffering, self and other has never been established.

This why Longchenpa can assert that the kāyas and wisdoms abide in the basis, without being a gzhan stong pa, because he agrees that even the appearances of nirvana have "never been established" and "have never existed from the moment they appear."


Unknown said:
Gorampa even criticizes Chokden for holding the Jonang view in his Distinguishing the Views.

Malcolm wrote:
Gorampa does not mention Shakya Chogden in Moonrays at all. I translated the text.

Unknown said:
the original intention of the Sakya founders as being closer to Jonang.

Malcolm wrote:
No. The locus classicus for Sakya view is a text called rin po che ljon shing by Jetsun Drakpa Gyaltsen, which is on the abhisamaya of the Hevajra Tantra.

He indeed proclaims that the view of the Hevajra Tantra, freedom from extremes, is higher than Madhyamaka. What is Jetsun's final view in this text? gNas lugs med pa, i.e. "There is no reality." Why? Because nothing can be found by way of an analysis of any of the four extremes in the relative or the ultimate. Since no relative phenomena can be found be means of such an analysis, there is nothing in the ultimate that can be found to exist in any of the four extremes nor in the middle. The Samputa says, "The yogi does not rely on emptiness, nor on nonemptiness, nor on the middle." The Sgra thal gyur states when explaining liberation from extremes (mtha' grol), "Since the extremes are not found, the middle is not found; since the middle is not found, the extremes are not found."


If you want to say that your infinite, uncompounded qualities exist in the ultimate, the very claim they exist in the ultimate makes you an eternalist because you are claiming something exists in the ultimate, and you are claiming the ultimate exists. The only way out of this problem is to accept that "all phenomena of samsara and nirvana have never existed from the moment they appear" like like illusions, dreams, moons in the water, optical illusions, fairy castles, and emanations.

Snyder is one of few serious historians who speaks Ukrainian and really understands the issues. Alternately, you can read Paul D’Anieri’s Ukraine and Russia: From Civilized Divorce to Uncivil War:

This possibility points to the difficulty in considering how the broader conflict might have been managed better. Nearly all the policies that would have made a dramatic difference would have required someone to give up something they deeply valued. Russia could have accepted the loss of Ukraine. Ukraine could have forgone its dreams of genuine independence. NATO could have rejected the pleas of potential new members. It is not hard to imagine why leaders sought to avoid these difficult sacrifices, and instead assumed that others would adjust. This discussion of how the war might have been averted also points to why the question of blame cannot be resolved by looking at the facts of what happened. Someone would have to surrender something important to decrease the chances of war. Who should have made the necessary concessions ‒ and is to blame for not making them ‒ is a matter of opinion. In many respects, the problem of blame boils down to what one thinks of Russia’s claim on Ukraine. To the extent the claim is not legitimate, Russia is to blame for pursuing it. To the extent that claim is legitimate, one can blame Ukraine for not acquiescing to it and the West for backing Ukraine. Similarly, whether the West should have recognized Russia’s claim to great power privileges or deferred to Russia’s local military superiority, or whether Russia should have acceded to the West’s claims about democratic norms, is a matter of values. These are normative questions whose answers depend on further assumptions about the rights of great powers, the inviolability of sovereignty and international law, the boundaries of realpolitik, and so on. How one answers those questions will determine whose claim one believes has greater weight, who should therefore have backed off, and who, in the final analysis, is guilty of not backing off and therefore to blame for the conflict. Even in February 2014, violence could have been avoided as long as each side refrained from shifting to violence. Whether that move to violence should be blamed on protesters in Kyiv, on Yanukovych, or on Russia also falls back on normative assumptions. Thus, rather than history or analysis resolving who is to blame, how one assigns blame tends to shape how one writes or reads the analysis.

What is accurate to say is that as wealth inequality grows, we are moving into a form of liberal meritocratic capitalism, run by oligarchs.

China’s economic success undermines the West’s claim that there is a necessary link between capitalism and liberal democracy. Indeed, this claim is being undermined in the West itself by populist and plutocratic challenges to liberal democracy.

—- Milanovic, Capitalism Alone.

But that does mean a majority of us support authoritarianism. Wealth inequality is the principle threat to democracy.

The two types of capitalism, liberal meritocratic and political, now seem to be competing with each other. They are led, respectively, by the United States and China. But even independently of China’s willingness to make available and to “export” an alternative political and, to some extent, economic version of capitalism, political capitalism itself has certain features that make it attractive to the political elites in the rest of the world and not only in Asia: the system provides greater autonomy to political elites. It is also attractive to many ordinary people because of the high growth rates that it seems to promise. On the other hand, liberal capitalism has many well-known advantages, the most important being that democracy and the rule of law are values in themselves and both, arguably, can be credited with encouraging faster economic development through promoting innovation and allowing social mobility, and thus providing approximately equal chances of success for all. It is the reneging on some crucial aspects of this implicit value system, namely a movement toward the creation of a self-perpetuating upper class and polarization between the elites and the rest, that represents the most important threat to the longer-term viability of liberal capitalism. This threat is a danger both to the system’s own survival and to the general attractiveness of the model to the rest of the world.

The Tathāgatagarbha is (other)empty of all afflictions (parabhāvaśūnyatā) but not its inherent buddha qualities, whereas afflictions are (self)empty of any inherent essence (svabhāvaśūnyatā).

Ratnagotravibhāga 155 said:
The Essence [of the Buddha] is [by nature] devoid
Of the accidental [pollutions] which differ from it;
But it is by no means devoid of the highest properties
Which are, essentially, indivisible from it.

Malcolm wrote:
We’ve already established that all your blather about qualities and so on is just so much verbal hot air to prop up the weak faith of those intimidated by emptiness.

Dolbupa and Geluk view are mirror images, one eternalist, the other annihilationist. This is why the Late Khenpo Appey used to joke that Geluk view was upside down gzhan stong.

MMK:

“All views of emptiness are a source of error.”

Dolbupa makes exactly the errors Gorampa ascribes to him. No one has ever addressed Gorampa’s objections in Moonrays, either from the Geluk side part (apart from Sonam Thakchoe)  or the Jonang side .

Shakya Chogdan is an interesting character, whiose perspective changed a lot during his lifetime. He wept when Gorampa passed away, and it is said, his final view was that of Rongton and Gorampa. The debates between Gorampa and Shakya Chogden largely concerned Domsum.

Modern gzhan stong in Kagyu largely depends on Shakya Chogden, not Jonang.

It is conceptual reification, just as much as asserting the ultimate is solely the absence of inherent existence. This why in Moonrays, Gorampa identifies these two extremes:

Although some say “even though the ultimate reality which is the object of realization
is permanent, stable, eternal and truly established;
but it does not appear to the mind that realizes reality.”
This claim is not nectar to the ear.

And:

Others...maintaining ultimate reality is the annihilationist emptiness,
they condemn freedom from the proliferation of the four extremes,
the essence of the teaching which comes from the excellent treatises of Nāgārjuna
as the Chinese Hashang view.

stong gzugs said:
Also, let's not forget that even those who tell others not to use language still use their own positive language describing luminosity etc., they just describe luminosity as self-empty in the same way as anything conventional, which is more incorrect than just describing it more accurately as other-empty.

They are both conceptual reificatons, so they are both wrong. So what is the correct Madhyamaka approach? Gorampa continues:

The intelligent common person who investigates reality
also does not reject the proliferation of the four extremes all at once,
but after rejecting the four alternately
by meditating in the proper way, when path of seeing arises
as both the reality which is devoid of the four extremes of proliferation
and the realizing mind are non-dual, 
the mind itself dissolves into the state free from proliferation, 
described conventionally as the view which sees the dharmadhātu. 
There is no difference in the perceived object of realizing the dharmadhātu
in this and the gnosis of a perfect Buddha.
Therefore, it is said “The one discovering the purest gnosis
develops the oceanic mind of the perfect Buddhas.”

As it is explained, when one is freed from the clouds of adventitious stains
by the power of the stream-like meditation of the unification of
the trio of the non-dual mind,
the creation of bodhicitta as stable as Mt. Meru
and the compassion which reaches the limits of space, [47/a]
it is conventionally described as the dawn of the sun of buddhahood.
At that time all consciousnesses and objects of consciousnesses
are nothing other than the nature of that gnosis.

This is superior to the two stages or analysis, as ChNN states. very clearly.  The Upadeśa on Primordially Pure Tregchöd commentary could not be clearer about this, and duplicates statements made by Longchen in chapter 10 verbatim, though without attribution.

The following is an older post of yours; but if he is saying that Shamatha is a necessary prerequisite for Dzogchen, and Shamatha can be attained in a single afternoon, then is he going in the wrong direction?

Malcolm wrote:
He is not saying śamatha can be attained in a single afternoon, is he?

And the distinction is this: Rongzom makes the point that if someone is not capable understanding the meaning of the Great Perfection and must resort to a path involving effort, then following the Mañjuśrīmitra's instruction, there are two indirect ways of entering into the knowledge of Dzogchen  combined with Dzogchen view: (1)  through developing a stable contemplation though standard parāmitāyāna śamatha and vipaśyanā practice, where he identifies six faults and ten obscurations of concentration and three faults related to vipaśyanā, which he explains in detail.

(2) One can practice his unique system of six limb yoga of Secret Mantra, again, combined with Dzogchen view. For example, following one's vows is considered to be pratyāhara-- one sees all the consciousnesses of the sense as fauts, but one does not abandon them. This is considered to render one a container for concentration. Concentration itself is focusing on the three secrets, the deity, mantra, and wisdom. In this context then, the five mental factor associated with concentration manifest. Once the factors of concentration arise, then one practices prāṇāyama, specifically breath retention, which produces different signs during the day and during the night, etc. It is quite detailed and interesting. He concludes, "In brief, also all these different concentrations will be skillful conduct if done in connection with the meaning of Dzogchen, but will be unskillful conduct if not connected."

No one can decide for you if you are someone who needs to practice with effort or without, but since the main point is to nakedly expose rig pa from the beginning, then, we try to achieve this from the beginning. If we succeed in this, then we do not need to follow the path of effort described above. All of these concentrations described by Rongom are considered "meditation" by Longchenpa, and mind-based, and distinct from the unique natural concentration that characterizes nakedly exposing vidyā.

Claiming however that one can only practice trekcho after realizing emptiness however, is totally in the wrong direction.

I dont agree with Brunnhölzl's analysis. All the text really doing is striking a balance against those who assert the Buddha only asserted the absence of self as an ontological commitment. But not even Nāgārjuna makes that claim, in fact he asserts the opposite, i.e., that the Buddha taught both self and not-self, depending on context. That is why the Buddha makes reference to the Middle Way in one passage, at the end of along a reply to Mañjuśrī, where he states that some do not understand the indirect (ldem po. saṃdhāya) meaning of liberation, self, and transcendence (lokottara).

That's why I specified about how emptiness is fully realized (i.e., at the end of the practice, not how it starts out). You're correct in that the practice does start out with contemplating the emptiness of objects like the village in the forest (where one has left the village and gone to the forest for renunciation), the earth in the forest, etc.* But when you get to the later stages, especially the seventh stage of signlessness, then emptiness is literally the absence of any characteristics that one could hold onto as an object, and by the final stage, not even the experience of emptiness itself is objectified: one just dwells in emptiness without any grasping. And, whereas some of these later stages were taught by pre-Buddhist teachers, it's that final non-grasping of emptiness as an object that leads to final liberation. So you finish by dwelling in emptiness that is independent of any object.

There is only this that is not emptiness, namely, the oneness dependent on the mendicant Saṅgha. In the same way, a mendicant—ignoring the perception of the village and the perception of people—focuses on the oneness dependent on the perception of wilderness.

It is empty of the perception of people. There is only this that is not emptiness, namely the oneness dependent on the perception of wilderness.’ And so they regard it as empty of what is not there, but as to what remains they understand that it is present. That’s how emptiness is born in them—genuine, undistorted, and pure...They understand: ‘Here there is no stress due to the defilements of sensuality, desire to be reborn, or ignorance.

Don’t remember reading a comparison of chronic lung problems from influenza vs COVID with the current variants, but I’m guessing results would be more equivalent than people think, and I’d love to see such a study if anyone knows of one.

Samdhinirmocana Sutra:
The pattern of clinging to what is entirely imagined refers to the establishing of names and symbols for all things and the distinguishing of their essences, whereby they come to be expressed in language. The pattern of other dependency refers to the pattern whereby all things arise co-dependently: for if this exists, then that exists, and if this arises, then that arises. This refers to the twelvefold conditions [aka the 12 nidanas], starting with 'conditioned by ignorance are karmic formations' and ending with 'conditioned by origination is this grand mass of suffering'...

the imagined pattern can be understood as caused by the interplay between images and words. The other-dependent pattern can be understood as caused by the grasping of those imagined images upon that other-dependent pattern.

Lankavatara Sutra:
...as the objects and forms of dependent reality appear, attachment results in two kinds of imagined reality. These are what the tathagatas... describe as 'attachment to appearance' and 'attachment to name'. Attachment to appearance involves attachment to external and internal entities, while attachment to name involves attachment to the individual and shared characteristics of those external and internal entities. These are the two kinds of imagined reality. What serves as the ground and objective support from which they arise is the dependent reality.

Malcolm wrote:

Longchenpa:
The impure dependent nature refers to all the illusory appearances that manifest via the different sense doors: the impure apsects of the universe, such as earth, rocks, mountains, cliffs, and the rest, together with the universe's contents, namely, beings. All these things are but the full development of the habitual tendencies [of the mind].

The pure dependent nature, on the other hand, refers to the pure fields and all that appears within the sphere of the pure vision of the buddhas: the buddhafields; the seven precious things; luminous, unfathomable palaces; and so on...

One way to summarize [the three natures] would be to say that what is imagined by names, thoughts, and so on is the imaginary nature. What is not imagined by names and thoughts but appears due to causes and conditions is the dependent nature. The dependent nature’s emptiness of the imaginary nature is the perfectly existent nature. This is a basic Chittamatra presentation.

This is not correct. There is such as thing as mundane correct view. A correct view in this case is one that is functional. For example, believing in normative causes and effects.

Buddhists only hold wrong views about essences, i.e. that knowledge obscuration of the innate habit of I-making.

ChNN understood what is stated in the Dzogchen tantras: we do not make a distinction between sharp and dull. If someone is sincerely interested in the teachings, they do not have to convert to Buddhism, but it is not because Buddhism contains any wrong views. It does not. There is no contradiction between Dzogchen and the four truths of nobles. There are serious contradictions however with Samkhya, etc.

Malcolm wrote:
The point I've been trying to make is that one cannot equate the semzins of Dzogchen Nyinthig with other kinds of semzins. Also, ChNN made this point many times. Referring to this as mere triumphalism is wrong.

If one wants to understand why common śamatha will not expose rig pa, and why exposing rig pa supercedes the need for developing śamatha in the classical way there are two things one must understand: First, from a Dzogchen point of view, śamatha and vipaśyanā are already present when rig pa is nakedly exposed, in other words, they are intrinsic to instant presence. Second, when one's calm state is based on mental objects, as soon as one abandons that object, posture, gaze, and so on, that calm state is also lost. On the other hand, once rig pa is nakedly exposed, one never loses that.

All I can do is recommend that you study the introductory section to chapter 10 of the Treasury of the Dharmadhātu Autocommentary where Longchenpa clearly and precisely distinguishes four differences between the calm state with and without support (including all completion stage practices of the lower tantras), which he refers to as meditation (bsgoms, bhāvana) and concentration (bsam gtan, dhyāna), which he characterizes as the special feature of Dzogchen (as does ChNN in his trekcho commmentary), in which bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality are innate to the naturally occurring (rang babs), concentration which in DC lingo, characterizes instant presence/contemplation.

It seems to me you are just objecting to the fact that I am contradicting BAW's assertion that it is necessary develop perfect śamatha before practicing Dzogchen.

According to you it appears that direct introduction isn't necessary and Longchenpa is wrong when he says:

Therefore, since there is no basis for confidence in the śamatha and vipaśyanā of the repose of a calm mind, [the path of the essential core] is superior.

Agreed. I'm sure it is sometimes used in relation to stillness/movement/noticing, and stability/steadiness as others have mentioned. It may not be Dzogchen Proper, but to insist Shamata has no relative or semantic relationship with Dzogchen seems out of touch with the needs of most practitioners in the world, and a bit condescending to all of the legit teachers who use it as a means to help prepare people. It might not be everyone's tea (shamatha without reference or trekchod), but it doesn't mean it should be thrown out for everyone or that the 'calm state' serves no function in relation to energy, clarity etc

Malcolm wrote:
Vasana, you are missing the point. I am talking about śamatha which is based in mind.

Vasana said:
“Similar words, different meanings: the ordinary and extraordinary shamatha and vipashyana are as different as sky and earth. Once more, don’t think that shamatha and vipashyana are unnecessary. In rigpa, the intrinsic steadiness is shamatha and the awake quality is vipashyana...

The Treasury of Dharmadhatu by Longchenpa says:
The original nature, totally free of all thoughts, is the ultimate shamatha. Natural cognizance, spontaneously present like the radiance of the sun, Is the vipashyana that is utterly uncontrived and naturally present.”

This is not the kind of śamatha I am referring to. In order to have this kind of "śamatha" one must have exposed rig pa nakedly.

Vasana said:
“Simulatenity:
Learning in this way to remain in relaxed presence, at a certain moment you find yourself in a state in which even though more or less thoughts continue to arise they do not disturb your presence and they vanish by themselves. That is, they self-liberate, because this state is not conditioned by the habitual continuity of judgement.

Particularly evident in this state is pure presence, called rigpa, non-dual awareness. 
Discernible within it, are three distinct fundamental elements ( ne-gyu- rig): 

1)  nepa, the calm state, like a still sheet of water; 
2)  gyuwa, the movement of thoughts, like a wave; 
3)  rigpa, the recognition of the presence of this wave. 

These three elements, however, are all present simultaneously in the same condition. Only by being in the state of Shine can you ascertain this concretely. “ -

Malcolm wrote:

Again, this precisely makes my point--one will never discover this state in ordinary śamatha, since there is no method to expose rig pa nakedly.

In both cases, this is post-empowerment, direct introduction, etc. I am referring the to common-sutra style śamatha BAW insists people must perfect before moving on to trekcho.

In any case, I am just reflecting what Longchenpa says and what my own gurus have taught in relationship to that. People are free to do what they want and follow who they want. It's not like achieving perfect śamatha according to the middle Bhāvanakrma is a bad thing, it just isn't Dzogchen at all.

All you need to do is look over these transcripts, and you can see that BAW clearly insists that one must, as a preliminary, focus on perfecting śamatha.

But this is not the path of Dzogchen and it never has been. Longchenpa again:

Here, the special path of the essential core (snying thig) is superior in five ways to the common meditations employed as the path: (1) There is no distinction between sharp and dull in faculties because vidyā is nakedly realized. (2) There is no dependence on analytical wisdom because pellucidity is directly realized by one’s sense organs. (3) There is no hope for meaning in intellectualism and rhetoric because vidyā that is beyond words is realized to be pellucid. {420} (4) Other than whatever appears as positive and negative delusions, there is no basis for confident clinging and grasping to appearances because the three kāyas are realized to be path appearances. (5) View, meditation, conduct, and result are seen as obscurations of vidyā because naked vidyā is pellucid. Therefore, since there is no basis for confidence in the śamatha and vipaśyanā of the repose of a calm mind, [the path of the essential core] is superior.

And the Sound Tantra:

There are neither dull nor sharp in capacity.

Now that you have received transmission from YSN, you can purchase these books and learn from them. Many Dzogchen practices such as the separation of samsara and nirvana as well as the semzins can be practiced with no further required transmissions other than a direct introduction. So now it is up to you. You practice these things, you gain some experience, and then you will have something to ask about. In the meantime, without some experience, you will not have any real valid questions. First things first, however. Learn Song of the Vajra. It is the supreme method of discovering your real nature.

Also I’m skeptical as to a distinction between developing trekchod based on semdzins vs. shine. In fact, I’m pretty sure I’ve seen techniques like gazing on the white ah actually called a semdzin somewhere.

So, I don’t really get the functional distinction other than Semdzins being more entertaining and interesting than traditional Shine techniques. I don’t mean that facetiously, more entertaining often means more engaging…but I don’t really get the distinction outside of this or that (maybe hyperbolic) claim of greater efficacy..

Malcolm wrote:
The term semzin is a translation of the term dharāṇa, as as it sounds, it is a prelude to dhyāna and samādhi.

There are twenty-one semzins mentioned explicitly in the the Dzogchen tantras and there is a smaller subset identified by . They are divided into three groups: the first group of seven are for placing the mind in a calm state; the second group of seven are for parting mind and body; and the third group of seven are for entering into dharmatā. Then there is rushan practice. But as I already mentioned, Longchenpa criticizes the approach of normative śamatha and vipaśyanā, which is object-bases. You might object, the semzins are object based as well. However, the semszin are structured in a logical sequence which indeed is more efficient, and allow one to easily discover the natural dhyāna of rig pa, which after all is the point.

This is far more effective than trying to achieve perfect śamatha, which is still based in mind, and is without any method of nakedly exposing rig pa.

If it isn't trekchö, it isn't Dzogchen. A beginner's practice should be focused on developing trekchö, systematically using the semzins and rushans. Sure, one can also apply Dzogchen view to the cultivation of the first dhyāna or also deity yoga using the six limb approach, but in reality, klong sde and man ngag sde are faster and more certain than these sems sde approaches.

The idea that one needs to spend months and years on developing śamatha according the middle Bhāvanakrama of Kamalaśila is misguided, from the point of view of Longchenpa. Longchenpa very specifically criticizes this approach in chapter 10 of the autocommentary of the Treasury of the Dharmadhātu.

Malcolm wrote:
This has nothing to do with what you agree or disagree with Jules. There is considerable room for improvement in your understanding of Dzogchen. For example, are you going to disagree with Vimalamitra when he states:

Thus, ignorance (ma rig pa) depends on knowledge (rig pa) and delusion depends on nondelusion. As such, knowledge (rig pa) itself becomes ignorance (ma rig pa) and nondelusion becomes delusion.

Or the Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra, pg. 196

Ignorance (ma rig pa) is realized essentially to be knowledge (rig pa);
concepts are realized to be the state of dharmatā;
the five attachments and aversions are the five pristine
consciousnesses;
the five objects are realized as the pure five lights..

Or, on page 274:

Vidyā (which can neither be clarified nor obscured)
and (the various appearances of) ignorance
are inseparable, realized to be one entity.

Or page 286:

Both knowledge (rig pa) and ignorance (ma rig pa) are also concepts of grasping.

Or page 354:

“The example for vidyā and ignorance is the form of water and ripples—
depending on conditions.

Other examples that are used for rig pa and ma rig pa being the same entity are water and ice, etc.

At the time when the basis stirred, Samantabhadra never entered into delusion, but in the first moment, he experienced ignorance—the ignorance of the same identical cause and the connate ignorance. Khenpo Ngachung affirms this in his notes on Nyoshul Khenpo's thogal teaching, folio 17/a, when Nyoshul Khenpo discusses the liberation of Samantabhadra: "Both of those [ignorances] existed for Samantabhadra, but wisdom (prajñā) arose at that juncture."

The whole point of Dzogchen is to understand how ignorance arose and how to reverse that process. You keep on inventing artificial criteria which are not reflected in the tradition and certainly are not consistent with how my teachers have taught Dzogchen teachings. Since I don't want to insult your teachers, I can only conclude that you have not studied hard enough and have been content with a superficial understanding the subject.

Thoughts are objects, really??

Malcolm wrote:
The object of the mental consciousness sense base (mano-āyatana) is the contents of the sense base of phenomena (dharmas) among the twelve sense bases, just as the object of eye consciousness sense base is the form sense base. The content of the sense base of phenomena is all mental activity, the ten neutral mental factors, applied attention, sustained attention, the ten positive mental factors, the six negative mental factors, the 14 afflicted mental factors, and so on.

From Stainless Space (supporting trekcho text):

Just as reflections arise in limpid water (chu dwangs), the eyes and clairvoyances will arise from limpid vidyā.  Moreover, one should practice by leaving the [six] sense faculties in their own limpidity (rang dwangs) without obstruction. Since the main sense organ, the eyes, are limpid, vidyā is limpid, because the eyes are the actual door of pristine consciousness. Otherwise, just as the appearance of reflections do not condition the water, [35/b] likewise, even though all outer appearances arise as a brilliant vision, since one’s consciousness does become lost among such appearances, it is said “they are not established in vidyā"...

Now then, if one becomes mindless (dran med) when meditating through blocking the group of six [eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and consciousness], one will deviate into an ignorant meditation. 

If one meditates having blocked the six outer objects, although there is mindfulness (dran pa), since objects are not clear, it is called “falling into one-sided śamatha”, and one will be reborn in the formless realms and so on. 

Though objects appear, since extremes have not been eliminated by the view, merely abiding in a mind of clarity and emptiness is a trace for being reborn in the form realm and so on. 

Therefore, having recognized that vidyā as liberated from extremes, it is very important that while in the state where there is no grasping to any objects or consciousness, objects are clear and vidyā is limpid. That is the pristine consciousness liberated from the three realms, called "the transcendent state of the universe and beings resting in the basis."

The vijñānaskandha, the aggregate of consciousness, itself is already nonconceptual by nature. When it perceives mental objects, such as a concept it takes another name, called "mental consciousness" (manovijñāna)." When it perceives form, it takes the name "eye consciousness" (cakṣurvijñāna).

Longchenpa is here indicating that you do not block the senses, which includes manas, the mental organ, nor to you block concepts, and so on, which are the object of the mental organ. The point is to not allow accepting or rejecting of either objects or consciousness.

Is the point just that thoughts ceaselessly pour out of the mind because that is its function and the only difference is whether you get carried away by them or just recognize them as thoughts? It feels like perhaps that's it, but if that's it, I don't understand how Jules wouldn't get that.

When there is sems, there is no rigpa. When there is rigpa, there is no sems.

One is latent when the other is manifest, just as when the sun sets, then the darkness is right there. It is like that.
Once you become stable in rigpa, sems does not have a chance.

Malcolm wrote:
This needs a bit of clarification. Longchenpa states in the Lama Yangthig, Stainless Space:

When mind comes and goes, vidyā is not truly evident. When vidyā remains in its own radiance, mind is not evident, seeming as though when one arises, the other ceases. However, when vidyā is stable, because the radiance of vidyā dissolves into the basis, mind ceases for a moment...When the mind arises, the radiance is evident; because the state of vidyā is not evident, it seems to have ceased (although it does not cease, since it does not arise or cease). 

That being so, it is very important to distinguish mind and pristine consciousness because all meditation is just that: all methods of purifying vāyu and vidyā are that; and in the end at the time of liberation, vidyā is purified of all obscurations because it is purified of the mind. The transcendent state abides as kāyas and pristine consciousness, and all critical points meet there.

And:

At that time, mental appearances and traces of the body, speech and mind are self-purified since one remains in vidyā’s own state. Since vidyā does not move, one is liberated from the minds of the desire realm. Since not even clarity is apprehended, one is liberated from the minds of form realm. Even though one is without concepts, since the radiance of vidyā unceasingly appears as objects, one is liberated from the minds of the formless realm.

What you are calling "thoughts" is just the radiance of rig pa. When that radiance wanders towards objects, it becomes mind, and then there are concepts. Once that radiance has been recognized, thoughts only happen when one is distracted. The proof that one is utterly undistracted, as Longchenpa points out, is the body of light:

However, when vidyā is stable, because the radiance of vidyā dissolves into the basis, mind ceases for a moment. The ordinary physical body dissolves into light, or when it is cast aside, since the breath stops, the body stops.

Malcolm wrote:
Why don't you take a look at the passage ChNN is referencing? However, the passage is not exactly what ChNN represents it to be in Mipham's text.

In Speech of Delight, pg. 125-134, you will find that Mipham is equating several scholars view of freedom from extremes (spros bral): Longchenpa, Gorampa, Marpa, Milarepa, Sapan, Tsongkhapa, Rangjung Dorje, Dolbupa, and Taranatha in that order. I have already pointed out that Dolbupa and other gzhan stong pas agree equipoise can only be free from all proliferation. Since other-emptiness is a post-equipoise view, it is necessarily conceptual.  Mipham also claims that the post-equipoise view of gzhan stong is analytical (133). This passage is also the sole passage where sugatagarbha is mentioned in the whole text.

Mipham then goes on to diplomatically discuss skillful means, and the necessity of teaching different sorts of teachings to different beings.

Moreover, in 1993, Conway, when discussing the Sakya master Mangtho, normally considered a gzhan stong pa, ChNN stated clearly that while there were similarities with gzhan stong in terms of the idea that the three kāyas were present in the basis, he distinguished Dzogchen from gzhan stong by point out that in Dzogchen the three kāyas are just potentials which require secondary conditions for manifestation, just as he does in the passage you mention here.

Finally, Mipham declares on page 84/85, my translation, "Because the intent of Śrī Candra—the profound view in which the biases of false conventions dissolve into the [dharma]dhātu because all these appearances are immediately pure where they are—is equivalent to the way original purity is confirmed in the texts of the Great Perfection, it is endorsed in our own lineage of vidyādharas..."

He earlier clarifies (pg. 75) that Candra's approach, is in his estimation, a cig car ba approach, one of equipoise in the union of two truths, (pg. 151), "There, through the way of the Consequence [prasanga] one gains certainty regarding the final Middle Way that accords with wakefulness [ye shes, gnosis] of equipoise."

The Yogacāra Madhyamaka, he states, is a gradualist presentation.

Thus, no one can claim that the final view of Nyingma school is not Candra's. We have the evidence of both Longchenpa and Mipham, as well as ChNN on this point.

So unlike your previous assertion that we shouldn't check the explanations of our teachers against the texts that they reference, in fact we actually do need to check their references.

To render the nine examples compatible with prasanga would require you to deny many passages in the Uttaratantrashastra itself, such as those concerning changelessness, the element not being empty, its being true permanence, bliss, self, and purity, and its being inseparable from qualities.

Malcolm wrote:
This is all resolved, simply put, through understanding tathātagarbha to be tathāta itself. It's right there in the name. Tathāta itself is the garbha of a tathāgata.

However it is not equivalent to an atman or the mind of false aspectarian yogacara, because these are refuted by the inferential analysis of madhyamaka, whereas tathagatagarbha cannot be subject to such analysis, not being an object of conceptual understanding, as the Uttaratantrashastra itself says many times.

Malcolm wrote:
If the first nine examples are taken literally, then yes, there is the problem of atmanavada.

As far as the qualities go, the qualities are clearly explained in the Uttaratantra as being a function of the accumulation of the two heaps. The chapter of qualities clearly outlines the 64 qualities that belong to the three kāyas. If you assert that omniscience of all aspects exist fully formed in sentient beings, you are confronted with the absurdity that sentient beings clearly are not omniscient and so on. There are many other contradictions with the assertion that qualities exist fully formed in the basis, which is dispelled by the fact that basis is not just self-perfected. In the Uttaratantra, these 64 qualities are resultant qualities, not qualities of the basis.

But of course we can name the cause after the result, since we do this all the time in Buddhadharma. Since the the nature of all sentient beings is nothing other than suchness, when that suchness is realized, being the nature of all phenomena, it is not surprising at all that many qualities of the three kāyas manifest. Since the nature of sentient beings is just suchness, for this reason, tathāgatagarbha doctrine and prasanga are not in contradiction when it is understood that the tathāta of tathātagarbha is just the same suchness that is taught in the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras. The two texts even use the same metaphor, space, to describe tathāta. Just as space is the source of all phenomena, likewise, tathāta is the source of all qualities of buddahood, but also, all faults of sentient beings. Just as space is not established substantially or as truly existent, likewise, tathāta itself is not established substantially or as truly existent. The Uttaratantra declares that tathātagarbha is free from all extremes, therefore, rightly understood, it is perfectly consistent with prasangika, and indeed, a prasangika perspective is the only correct approach to this teaching.

When it come to gzhan stong and Nyingma, apart from a handful of writers in the Nyingma school who adhered to to it, beginning in the 18th century, it was not a popular view in Nyingma. It was first popularized in Eastern Tibet among the Karma Kagyus, from whom it spread into some quarters of the Nyingma school via Kongtrul’s influence.

Rongzom would have rejected it. Longchenpa explicitly rejected it, as did Mipham, Khenpo Zhenga, and so on. Among those modern Dzogchen teachers who flat out rejected the compatibility of gzhan stong and Dzogchen view was Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, our own teacher, who mentioned this point many times. I imagine Khenchen Namdrol also rejects it, as his personal point of view is aligned with Gorampa, at least that’s what he told me thirty years ago (Gorampa = Dzogchen, was basically what he said).

Referring to the Big Red Book, and specifically not to the translator's introduction where neither Bhavaviveka nor Bhavya are mentioned at all, but to Dudjom's actual contents on pp. 178-186, as far as I can see there is no citation from either Bhavaviveka or Bhavya at all. There is just a passing reference to him (excuse absence of diacritical marks here) along with, firstly Nagarjuna and Asanga, going on to to say "similarly explained by" Ratnakarasanti, Bhavya, Atisa et al.

"... what is important here is understand... that when the sense fields are laid to rest in their ground in Longde's practice of Dzogchen, then this luminosity is not neutral. It's completely and perfectly divine. It is brilliant wonderment and bliss beyond any imagining.

If one practices Dzogchen without the proper foundation in Ngondro and Generation Phase and Completion Phase, then one's Dzogchen practice tends to become a kind of dry, aloof, untouchability. One may really become an asshole Dzogchenpa in that fashion, filled with the conceit of conceptual enlightenment. If you are actually practicing Dzogchen, then mind becomes utterly pure and radiant and one recognizes all of appearance as divine wonderment, unbearable in its blissful quality. When there is no concept to solidify and make the sense perception rigid and false, then its immediate moment enhances and always points to the true nature of perception, which is the luminosity of awareness. This is called rangbop in Tibetan. 'Rang' meaning the self-nature of awareness, 'bop' to settle in. And so, this is what Milarepa is saying in the line that says, "Awareness is luminous, in its depths it is bliss."

One other thing, at the risk of over-speaking:

Malcolm wrote:
This system of the natural great perfection's usual manner of evaluating freedom from extremes, and so on, is the same as prasaṅga madhyamaka.  The difference is that in madhyamaka an emptiness that is considered to be like empty space is made into the basis, whereas here, naked, originally pure vidyā—neither provable nor negatable—made into the basis. All the phenomena that arise from that [basis] are evaluated to be liberated from extremes, like space.

ThreeVows said:
Generally speaking I think you could say that prasangika madhyamaka is unsurpassed when it comes to this particular function. It is basically the terminal point of analysis of the mind. There is nothing beyond it, in terms of this analysis.

And yet, the vajrayana isn't entirely about 'the mind' in this sense.

Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche says, basically, paraphrased from memory, that the 2nd turning is sort of half-relative, half-ultimate. I think the relative aspect is basically the orientation of the mind that culminates in the terminal approach of prasangika madhayamaka dialectics. This is like if you were in some big room, and there were many doors, and all of the doors got closed except for one, single door, the only door that actually led out of the room. Prasangika Madhyamaka is the doorway to the realization of the path of seeing. And the realization of suchness, which is the vajra, is that which is through that door. Vajrayana proper is founded on this. This is the ultimate aspect of the 2nd turning.

But anyway, in terms of 'evaluating freedom from extremes', there is nothing better. It is the great sharp sword that liberates.

Malcolm wrote:
I don’t find evaluating Dharma in terms of the three turnings to be useful—there is no agreement on it among different scholars. For example, as I read the sole brief passage the doctrine is based on, it defines the third as merely a reemphasis of the second.

Malcolm wrote:
It is quite fair to say so, since the understanding of a direct negation in Dzogchen is not understood in the same way as in say, Tsongkhapa. For Tsongkhapa, the direct negation of inherent existence alone, is the example ultimate. Where as we see above, Dzogchen and Prasanga are alike in negating all four extremes both in the relative and the ultimate without positing something in their place [the middle is also directly negated as well]. Longchepa's statement above (naked, originally pure vidyā—neither provable nor negatable—made into the basis) is an echo of Rongzom's chapter four of Intro to Mahāyāna Systems, devoted to proving that while Dzogchen cannot be proven through reasoning, neither can it be negated through reasoning.

When you succeed in dissolving the outer-inner world, you experience an entirely different realm of appearances that are not samsaric, but are the divine mandala.

Malcolm wrote:
This is totally dualistic, but it is characteristic of the path of transformation, thinking that one appearance is good and another appearance is bad. Emptiness always manifests as a directly perceived appearance since everything is empty, arises from emptiness, and disappears back into emptiness.

Malcolm wrote:
Not in reality, only conventionally, from the point of view of dualistic vision. In reality, everything is just the same state of bodhicitta. Kathog Dorje Gyaltsen writes:

Bodhicitta self-appears as everything, manifesting as totally complete in the distinct particles in space and in the smallest worms on up, just like the sun, moon and stars arise in a placid ocean.

As the All-Creating King States:

Oh great hero, understand this nature of mine!
I am the nature of bodhicitta.
Bodhicitta is the all-creating king. 
The nature of the all-creating king is body, speech, and mind.
There isn’t a single thing body, speech, and mind do not do.
All that is done by the bodies, speech, and minds of the buddhas of the three times
and also the bodies, voices, and minds of the sentient beings of three realms,
are done by my body, speech, and mind, the all-creating king. 
Everything included in appearance and existence, the universe and inhabitants,
is done by my body, speech, and mind, the all-creating king
in the state of dharmatā’s unfabricated suchness.

Longchenpa explains:

"Here, it is asserted [that the outer universe] arises from the potential grasping at a self in the state of bodhicitta. Other than being mere play of the potential from the time it arises, there isn’t any inside or outside; {308} clearly apparent nonexistents are asserted to be mere appearances of dependently originated apparent conditions of phenomena, which are not established as mind or as other than mind.

Kālacakra completely dismantles the notion that there is an internal channel system and an external world, because it shows how both are mistaken appearances of a singular Kālacakra mandala.

Malcolm wrote:
See above. In Dzogchen there are basically two phases: the basis arises as the universe and beings under the influence of avidyā and the universe and beings arise as the basis under the influence of vidyā. That's it. The String of Pearls Tantra states:

The universe and inhabitants have always been empty,
the ultimate endowed with the form of the relative.
One does not need to map anything onto anything. The world and beings just as they are, is already perfect and required no purification at all.
This is why Dölpopa accuses people like you of claiming that the shell is actually white, even though you haven't cured the jaundice.
Jaundice is also perfect and does not need to be removed. Buddhahood in this Life states:

If it is objected, “If afflictions are liberated into dharmatā without antidotes, there is no need for purification on the path. Otherwise, liberation would require no effort,” for what reason would those who do not understand be liberated? Asserting that those who understand are liberated merely by recognizing concepts as dharmatā is the fruit of one’s wishes. As such, in order to recognize that concepts are dharmatā, the intimate instructions of the guru are important.
But I'm glad you're now acknowledging that gzhanstong comes from these Indian texts.
It comes from one Tibetan's understanding of the Maitreyan corpus. Whether his understanding is correct is another matter, and is quite debatable. For example, like the debate over whether Tsongkhapa understood Prasanga perfectly. He also claimed his understanding derived from his profound experience of meditation.
All the buddha qualities are fully formed. BUT this doesn't mean that they will already be expressed, because there are defilments/obscurations that need to be removed.
This is incoherent. If they are fully formed, they should be functional whether or not there are obscurations. Otherwise, you are arguing that obscurations are more powerful than buddha qualities, an argument that natsuke raised, when the opposite should be true.
This is, phenomenologically, incredibly accurate to at least my experience of practice. When meditation practice is going well, and the winds and mind still
"When meditation practice is going well..."

For as long as mind is employed as the path, when effort is made in the practice of meditating a calm mind, it will exist. When the effort is dropped, [the calm mind] will perish— that is its actual nature. For as long as the pristine consciousness of vidyā is employed as the path, since it abides in the stream of naturally occurring concentration, qualities will arise naturally, and those will be present at all times without any possibility of being separate from them.

-- Longchenpa

The buddhahood that exists as the ground is like a wish-fulfilling jewel covered by the mud of the stains. Cleansing it with the stream of the view, meditation, and conduct causes the result of the dharmakāya reality body endowed with twofold purity, which is like the jewel without stains, to actualize, and everything meaningful for oneself and others is spontaneously present ...
Again, this is just the error of asserting the basis (ground) is naturally perfected (spontaneously present).

The String of Pearls Commentary notes:

Since the position that the basis is naturally perfected is flawed, the basis is impossible. If the cause is asserted to be naturally perfected, the basis will be ineffective. Since the basis is given the name “cause,” the expression itself is defective. In that case, if it is deemed established, is the result established in that cause or not? If it is deemed established, one will not be able to avoid the fault that the result will possess a contradiction.

What if sometimes [the basis] is a cause in which the result is also established? Since the cause is established from the
result, there is (1) the fault of an infinite regress and (2) the unavoidable fault that the cause and the result are the same. If it is asserted [that the cause and the result] are the same, the expression, “the cause and result of karma,” will be defective.

If it is asserted that the cause and result are different, the assertion that the cause is naturally perfected is defective. If that cause is established in the result, one cannot reject the consequence that the result is the cause. Therefore, since the result cannot be designated as the cause, the connection of the cause and the result should be understood from investigating them—causes generate results, but causes are not generated from results.

Alternatively, if it is asserted that everything is naturally perfected from everything, since one will not be able to refute what has not been asserted, one will not be able to prove one’s own assertion. Therefore, there is no purpose in [asserting the basis is] naturally perfected.

Since proving a favorable position and disproving an unfavorable position makes a naturally perfected basis one-sided, the assertion of a naturally perfected basis is defective. 

Suppose that the naturally perfected basis is stated to be nondual. If the cause, result, and so on are nondual, the assertion
of a naturally perfected basis is defective. Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are also rendered false. Further, reasoning negates the absence of a result at the time of a naturally perfected cause and so on. There are more reasonings to be elaborated with respect to that, but they will not be elaborated here.


While the ground buddhahood of the dharmakāya reality body and the resultant buddhahood of the dharmakāya reality body have not the slightest difference in essence, they are distinguished as ground and result by means of the presence or absence of incidental stains. This is like referring to the space of the sky in situations when it is free or not free of clouds and so forth.
You might imagine the following is similar, but it isn''t. There is just a similarity in terms, but not meaning. Longchenpa writes in the Lama Yangthig:

When one has attained proficiency in the self-recognition of one’s great naturally perfected primordial buddhahood of vidyā which exists within oneself, after afflictions have become self-cleansed and self-purified, the state of the stable clarity of one’s naked vidyā (in terms of being free from the modifications of hope and fear) is like the sun free from clouds, or like delusion never being conceived within one’s mind. Since one does not regress, it is similar with the first contact of impurity. It is like the marking nut of the bse tree, or, is like attaining one’s independence having taken one’s own seat without moving like the coronation of a prince.

However, there is no dharmakāya in the result. Hence your language is incoherent and belongs to lower vehicles. In the commentary to the Tantra Without Syllables it is pointed out that:

The three kāyas and the five pristine consciousnesses are not the result, but the path.

The difference between your view and the view of Dzogchen is that faults themselves are the qualities and the qualities are the faults. Again at time of the basis rising up out of the basis:

In the unceasing potential of the qualities of the source (natural perfection), the qualities transformed into faults from the essence forming as the kāyas, the nature [31a] forming as light, and compassion forming as rays.

And when the universe and beings arise as the basis:

Furthermore, purity arises as the door of pristine consciousness through the aspect of naturally perfected qualities. Impurity appears as delusion when it seems to arise as the mode of entering samara. When the mode of reversing delusion seems to arise, once there is liberation into purity that exists without abandoning delusion, there is buddhahood.
Buddhahood is taught to be the enlightened body of primordial awareness, and the incidental impurities are taught to be the groups of consciousness.
Yes, which means you have a total duality here since these are considered to be substantially different.

In Dzogchen, ye shes is regarded as the being the basis for sems. While sems is regarded as a obscuration to be given up, it is not regarded as a substantially different entity since it arises out of the  potential (rtsal) of ye shes, manifesting as play (rol pa, dualism).  Longchenpa points out:

In addition, all phenomena of samsara depend on the mind, so when the essence of mind is purified, samsara is purified. Since the phenomena of nirvana depend on the pristine consciousness of vidyā, because one remains in the immediacy of vidyā, buddhahood arises on its own...

The essence of mind is the radiance of vidyā which is mounted on the vāyu. The essence of vidyā is intrinsically clear without vāyu (the pristine consciousness vāyu of purified karmavāyu free from coming and going).

The answer is that Buddhism has elements that are religious, elements that are philosophical, elements that are contemplative, elements that are cultural, elements that are ethical, and so on, and people become involved in Buddhadharma because of interest in all, several or one of these elements.

But this is not necessarily a religious quest, actually, it is just a change in attitude that results in the cessation of suffering.

Thank you, is this explained further in Finding Rest in Illusion (I assume those are the 8 examples you are talking about?)?.

What use is there in positing the outer phenomena when you can skip to the shared karmic perspective directly?

Also a side note, do you know need lung for Finding Rest in Illusion? I have pointing out instructions from multiple teachers in case that is necessary.

A shared karmic perspective does not negate the liquid substance that is perceived differently in the six lokas.

when the self-cognizing primordial wisdom is wrapped in the webs of defilement caused by the illusion of duality, it is called 'mind'. For it consists in the nonvirtuous mental factors of detecting cognition and discernment. Liberation from this is called buddhahood. For even though (in that state) an object is known, there is a freedom from duality, as implied in detecting cognition and discernment.

To say the ultimate is empty of relative phenomena is to claim there is an ultimate which exists outside phenomena, it’s akin to claiming that wetness exists separately from water or heat from fire. In fact no ultimate can be established apart from relative phenomena at all, since the ultimate is just seeing the suchness of phenomena, as Candrakirti states, all things have two natures, one seen correctly, the other not.

(Although, funny enough, Dölpopa tracked down an instance where Candrakirti teaches basic gzhanstong below.)

Unknown said:
Whether buddhas arise or they do not,
In reality, the emptiness of nature,
Of all real things has been proclaimed
As emptiness of the reality of “other.”
The true, pure ultimate reality as well as suchness
Is the emptiness of other things ...
“Other” reality is the supreme arising of suchness (dharmata).
This, arising as supreme, is eternal existence.

Malcolm wrote:
Did you look and see how Candrakīrti describes this?

He explains the passage as follows: "Extrinsic existence (gzhan gyi dngos po, parabhāva) is the supreme truth. It is supreme because it always exists. As it is one in aspect, since extrinsic existence is the apogee of gnosis, it is the existence (bhāva) of realization. That is the emptiness of suchness. Again, having an outside existence is to extrinsically exist. Because of transcending samsara, so-called "extrinsic existence" is the reality limit. Since it is immutable, the meaning is that the emptiness of the suchness that is empty of characteristics is the emptiness of extrinsic existence."

So here, what is being described as outside, or extrinsic to, samsara is the gnosis, the emptiness of suchness, it's emptiness of characteristics. It certainly doesn't say anything at all about truly existing, ultimate buddha qualities, which would be characteristics.

All Candrakirti is saying here is just what Nāgārjuna says in the MMK 18:9-12

The characteristic of suchness. 
cannot be known from another, is peace,
free from all proliferation,
nonconceptual, and without differentiation. 


Something produced dependent on another
is not the same as the latter
nor is it other, 
therefore, it is neither permanent nor annihilated. 

The ambrosial teachings of
the buddhas, the protectors of the world,
is that there is neither sameness nor difference, 
permanence nor annihilation. 

Though a perfect buddha has not yet to arise,
and the śrāvakas are no more,
the gnosis of pratyekabuddhas 
will arise without the teacher.

However, as there is nothing that is not empty, where is there something to be empty?

Chariots are empty of minds. Sentient beings are not empty of minds. Therefore, they can become buddhas and chariots cannot. Therefore, chariots and sentient beings are not the same and are not empty in the same way. This should be obvious.

However, those who argue that there is a blank ultimate of nonexistence are the gzhan stong pa, who assert relative phenomena do not exist at all in the perfected nature (gzhan stong), because they claim the perfected is empty of both the imputed and dependent natures (rang stong).
Again, simply false. There is no "blank ultimate of non-existence," because the ultimate is empty of relative phenomena,
You are asserting that the ultimate nature of relative things is a nonexistence, an utter void (rang stong). This far worse that Geluk extreme of asserting that relative phenonena are merely empty of the true existence that is inherent existence. You don't even give relative things mere existence, like they do. Worse, you split the two truths in half. It is impossible for you to appreciate the inseparability of samsara and nirvana.
Pratyahāra, sense withdrawal, is just resting in a nonconceptual mind.
No. You don't have oral instructions and don't seem to understand the practice. At best, you're confusing pratyahāra with the unique preliminary of wensum. Tārānatha gives the definition of pratyahāra as withdrawing the mind from ordinary experiences to then engage with the appearances of primordial wisdom. A major barrier in your understanding of Kālacakra is that you don't grok Dölpopa's distinction between Mādhyamaka without Appearance (snang med dbu ma) and Mādhyamaka with Appearance (snang bcas dbu ma).
This just shows you have not been paying attention at all. Appearances and emptiness are never separate, and I never asserted they were. You are like a man shouting in an empty valley, who thinks they arguing with someone else, when they are just debating with their own echo.
.
Longchenpo points out in his Treasury of Citations:

In brief, all meditations with and without support are included.

Tārānatha makes roughly the same critiques of other practice systems (including Dzogchen) not being the actual completion stage, but only nominal, because they only address the relative bindus and nadis.
This just means Taranatha had no understanding of Dzogchen at all and never received any teaching on it.

Your claim is quite uncertain. Dudjom Rinpoche writes in the Big Red Book, pg. 301:

So it is said by Naropa:

The single definitive means is the truth of the nucleus.

the diverse vehicles of thought,
have resorted to the provisional and not the definitive, etc.,[/i]

Malcolm wrote:
Got a translated source that provides the fuller context around this quote? Naropa was famously a Kālacakra yogin, and key promoter of the system, so the odds that he denigrated it in the way this quote implies are nil.
It's from a text called the Ratnaprabhā-nāma (Toh. 1342). In this text, Naropa completely rejects a path based on causes and results, such as creation and completion stage. Since it is also found in the Kagyu Mahamudra collections, I am sure Karl B will have a complete translation of it.

The body, speech, and mind of the pure victor
is produced from the essential meaning without striving.
In the meaning of bodhicitta, 
the single definitive vehicle is the essential meaning,
but the four grades of mudras, the sadāṅgayoga, 
the various vehicles of thought,
are provisional, not definitive. 
There is no high or low in the essence,
aspiration and engaged [bodhicitta] are exhausted as conceptual thoughts, 
The unique mind essence is free from extremes, 
different results do not exist, there is no path,
the yoga of noncontrivance is the perfect path.
The nonabiding nature is the same in the mind,
arriving at the end without traveling is a result?
Free from cause and condition, without arising and perishing,
clear as the self-originated essence from the beginning. 
However the six realms appear 
and the nature of nirvana
are inseparable, the same in the self-originated mind.
The mental concepts of the six realms
and the cognizance of intrinsically clear gnosis
are no different, the same in the essence...etc.

Unknown said:
if the key points such as the posture of the body, and so on, for nonconceptual mind are dropped, [that nonconceptual mind] will perish, and also [vidyā] will not be exposed nakedly. Nonconceptual vidyā is the complete opposite of that.[/i]

Malcolm wrote:
Again, you lack oral instructions, so you're misapplying critiques onto Kālacakra that don't apply to it. The second yoga of Kālacakra already has pointers on recognizing everyday objects that seem solid as made of empty forms. It's hard to explain, but you ever do open-eye meditation and see how everyday objects have a sort of glimmering halo of light around them? It's kind of like that, except it's not just a ring outside the objects, but the entire object itself. So nothing stops once you exit meditation. You just start seeing, hearing, etc. everything as these luminous empty forms and, as you get further along, the experience organizes itself into a mandala-like pattern. That's why Dölpopa says that Mādhyamaka with appearances is the highest teaching, because we can go beyond conventional appearances altogether, and see everything as a divine mandala.
There is no need to see everything as a divine mandala. There is no need to go beyond conventional appearances. That's just a contrivance of faces and hands which does not go beyond the view of mahāyoga.

Further, Madhyamaka itself is just a deviation, as the Soaring Garuda points out:

Since phenomena and nonphenomena have always been merged and are inseparable,
there is no further need to explain an “ultimate phenomenon.

For example, Mañjuśrīmitra states:

Therefore, because awakening and nonawakening are the same in terms of absence of characteristics, there is nothing to accept or reject.
In accordance with that meaning, all those explanations 
of the nominal ultimate, the absence of arising and ceasing, sameness, 
nonduality, beyond thought, emptiness, the dharmadhātu, 
freedom from expression and convention, and so on are neither ultimate nor relative.
If it is said, “This is the path in accordance with the ultimate,” that is relative.

What more is there to say?

Unknown said:
Rongzompa almost gets there. But the key distinction is that Dzogchen as far as I've seen

Malcolm wrote:
Then you have not been looking.

Dzogchen asserts that appearances of the universe are just the five lights of pristine consciousness perceived incorrectly. This is why there is no point in the creation and completion stage, from a Dzogchen point of view, unless someone needs this as a temporary crutch.

Unknown said:
it emphasizes instead how those external things appear in the inner mirror of our individual awareness, arguing how those appearances in the mirror arise from our body. But in Kālacakra, we do have something to say beyond Nagarjuna because we see that there are patterns that link microcosm and macrocosm, and we can actually work with these patterns. So instead of just looking at the external world and saying, oh it's all inherently empty,

Malcolm wrote:
You clearly don't understand Dzogchen.

Unknown said:
we identify those specific patterns in the external world that map onto the internal world, and then through the sadangayoga, we see that this entire conventional reality with internal and external correspondence patterns are actually just sort of weak echoes of a non-dual mandala that is other-empty. "As in the external, so in the internal, as in the internal so in the other." Dölpopa explains this in Mountain Dharma.

Malcolm wrote:
This is way too intellectual, contrived, and full of effort.

One does not need to map anything onto anything. The world and beings just as they are, is already perfect and required no purification at all. As it says in the Soaring Garuda:

Since there is no object to attain, there is nothing other than the three realms.

A commentary states:

Because the three realms themselves have attained buddhahood already in the essence of natural perfection, it is ascertained that a result generated by a cause is not a separate object to be attained.

And further, from the same text:

In order to demonstrate the deviations of the stages:

"Even relying on the tenth bhumi is an obstruction to awakening."

The seeking that relies on the path method of the tenth bhumi of the causal bodhisattvas and the wish to attain by relying on the tenth stage of outer, inner and secret secret mantra does not see the place that is free from being traversed. 

"The extremely rapid pristine consciousness is free from all thoughts."

That being the case, because the self-originated pristine consciousness, the basis of everything, is free from gradual progression, it is more rapid because of emphasizing nonprogression through mere seeing. Since that is free from all goal-oriented apprehension of objects and apprehending subjects, it is very special because there is no obscuration to purify.
Anyway, if mere acceptance of tathagatagarbha makes one a gzhan stong pa, then everyone is a gzhan stong pa.
Gzhanstong says that: there is kun gzhi ye shes that is beyond momentariness and not dependently originated (unlike the kun gzhi rnam shes), within which all of samsara and nirvana manifest (making it empty of them), and is the source of all the buddha qualities.
Dzogchen says, all samsara and nirvana are nothing other than self-originated pristine consciousness, and this is also not established, being free from a basis or a root.
In terms of the buddha qualities, it says the buddha qualities are fully formed and don't need to be created anew, only need to be recognized and manifested, which is what the path is for.
This is the error of asserting the basis is lhun grub. It violates cause and effect, which is why gzhan stong and Dzogchen are not compatible. When it is said that the kāyas and wisdoms exist in the basis, it simply means they exist as potentials, not matured.
The critique that saying the buddha qualities are already fully formed invalidates the need for a path has already been addressed by Dölpopa in Mountain Dharma.
Not satisfactorily, which is why Longchenpa explictly rejects the gzhan stong view.

I am not really qualified to comment on Zen, one way or other. However, this passage by Dogen really strikes me as a beautiful expression of realization, right up there with some of Longchenpa's writings:

BUDDHA DHARMA CANNOT be known by a person. For this reason, since olden times no ordinary person has realized buddha dharma; no practitioner of the Lesser Vehicles has mastered buddha dharma. Because it is realized by buddhas alone, it is said [in the Lotus Sutra], “Only a buddha and a buddha can thoroughly master it.” 

When you realize buddha dharma, you do not think, “This is realization just as I expected.” Even if you think so, realization inevitably differs from your expectation. Realization is not like your conception of it. Accordingly, realization cannot take place as previously conceived. When you realize buddha dharma, you do not consider how realization came about. Reflect on this: what you think one way or another before realization is not a help for realization. 

Although realization is not like any of the thoughts preceding it, this is not because such thoughts were actually bad and could not be realization. Past thoughts in themselves were already realization. But since you were seeking elsewhere, you thought and said that thoughts cannot be realization. 

However, it is worth noticing that what you think one way or another is not a help for realization. For this reason, you become cautious not to be small-minded. Indeed, if realization came forth by the power of your prior thoughts, it would not be trustworthy. 

Realization does not depend on thoughts, but comes forth far beyond them; realization is helped only by the power of realization itself. Know that then there is no delusion, and there is no realization.

From 84000: https://read.84000.co/translation/toh232.html

Excerpts about Devadatta:
From now on, great brahmin, without saying such things, consider the following words and no others. Devadatta, the group of six monks, and their followers are grateful to the Tathāgata. Devadatta is one who inspires supreme joy. Devadatta loves the family of the Tathāgata. Devadatta is the culmination of the Tathāgata’s activities. Devadatta is a great being who demonstrates the Tathāgata’s virtuous qualities. Devadatta, the group of six monks, and their followers completely establish tens of millions of sentient beings in meritorious behavior. Great brahmin, no sentient beings are capable of drawing the blood of a tathāgata, foe- destroyer, complete and perfect buddha. The Tathāgata’s body should be viewed as being like a tree’s shadow; you should see it as an expedient means.

Great brahmin, even trillions of māras could not divide the saṅgha. This schism within the saṅgha should be viewed as an expedient means. Devadatta and the group of six monks do not create schism among the saṅgha. Devadatta and the group of six monks represent the Śākya family. They do not conduct themselves in such a way as to be born as animals or among ordinary people. Having been born in the Śākya family and gone forth to renunciation at the feet of the Tathāgata, what need is there to say that they do not engage in such actions? The idea is unfounded. Devadatta and the group of six monks act very kindly. Devadatta does not merely wear the saffron-colored robes. Devadatta is not a famished bald- head. Devadatta and the group of six monks are bound by the pratimokṣa vows. Devadatta is not determined to do evil. Devadatta does not desire to do evil. Devadatta and the group of six monks should be known as monks representing the Tathāgata’s expedient means. All bodhisattvas play within the hell realms by means of the superknowledges. This should be seen as the domain of bodhisattvas. Devadatta will not go to the hell realms.

Great brahmin, you should rejoice in Devadatta as the bodhisattva mahāsattva named Mahākapila, who, after giving instruction, was surrounded by a group of six bodhisattvas.

The Bhagavān then replied to the bodhisattva Great Cloud Essence, “Excellent, Great Cloud Essence, excellent! So it is. Great Cloud Essence, in order to eradicate the doubts of all outsider sentient beings, you have given this excellent explanation. On the basis of the Tathāgata’s concealed speech, you have explained the domain of the Tathāgata—which is not the same as that of the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas—and the greatness of Devadatta’s virtuous qualities. Excellent, excellent! Great Cloud Essence.

What is its kammic inheritance?3 These questions are not aimed at the extinction of Dukkha. That being so they are not Buddhist teaching and they are not connected with it. They do not lie in the sphere of Buddhism...

Therefore, there being no one born here, there is no one who dies and is reborn. So, the whole question of rebirth is utterly foolish and nothing to do with Buddhism at all...

The Buddhist teachings aim to inform us that there is no self and nothing belonging to a self, there is only the false understanding of the ignorant mind. There is merely body and mind, which are nothing but natural processes. They function like a mechanism that can process and transform data. If they do so by the wrong method, it gives rise to foolishness and delusion, so that one feels that there is a self and things which belong to a self. If they do so by the correct method, those feelings do not arise; there is the primal truth-discerning awareness (satipanna), the fundamental true knowing and clear seeing that there is no self and nothing belonging to a self.”

Astus said:
One can (and should) reason whether the teachings are correct or incorrect, but reasoning itself is not considered a sufficient and reliable source (AN 3.66, MN 95), but it is through direct knowledge of the teaching that one attains established faith in the Buddha (MN 47, SN 47.12).
On the other hand, if one were to come to some different conclusion than what is taught in the scriptures, would that still be considered acceptable as a correct Buddhist view? Can a Buddhist contradict the Buddha?

Malcolm wrote:
Buddhists contradict the Buddha all the time. This is why we have the notion of definitive and provisional teachings, which are philosophical distinctions posing as religious ones, couched in pseudographia—sūtras—used a proof texts for this and that philosophical position. The strategy here is to put words in the mouth of the Buddha so that one never can be accused to directly contradicting something the Buddha said. This is also why so-called mainstream Buddhists rejected Mahāyāna in toto because their Buddha and our Buddha couldn't seem to agree on much other than the three afflictions and a notion of karma. We all just cherry-pick what we like from a morass of conflicting doctrines, using excuses like "skillful means," "relative and ultimate," "definitive and provisional" to defend our interpretations of a large body of contradictory texts set down largely between 100 BCE and 1100 CE.

Astus said:
All that matters is that one recognizes the three afflictions drive karma, which results in suffering. And if one is a Mahayani, to have a commitment to benefit sentient beings in whatever ways one can. If one believes in rebirth, so much the better, but it isn’t necessary.
And is there a Buddhist tradition, a school, a lineage that operates with such a minimalist approach?

Malcolm wrote:
Traditions, schools, and lineages with their rituals, such as ordination rituals, bodhisattva vow ceremonies, empowerments, and so on, are something invented by Buddhists, not the Buddha.

Ultimately, one is one's own authority, one decides what to accept and what to reject. There is, in Buddhism, no central authority who decides what is and what isn't Buddhism. This is so obvious I don't even know why we are discussing it.

The one common factor we can find among all Buddhist schools, however, is the idea that suffering is caused by karma, and that karma is caused by affliction, and in Mahāyāna, the idea that we have an intrinsic moral obligation to benefit others apart from ourselves.

Otherwise, there is no agreement on lineage, rules, rites, prayers, etc., all the ancillary stuff which Buddhists have added to this basic formula and get so worked up about.

Aren’t you are saying that faith in (let’s call it) ‘the ‘unprovable stuff’ is essential to practice Mahayana? But then you are saying that one doesn’t have to believe in ‘unprovable stuff’ if one isn’t on the Bodhisattva path?
So doesn’t mean that faith isn’t required?

Astus said:
Mahayana begins with the intention to attain buddhahood to liberate all beings. At the time of aspiration there is no direct knowledge of what buddhahood is, nor of many other elements of the path needed to get there. Furthermore, unless one reduces the meaning of the terms like 'bodhisattva' and 'all beings', and does not take into account the Jatakas and other accounts of bodhisattvas, there are necessarily rebirth and other things involved.
As for faith in Buddhism in general, if one interprets it as a temporary method to alleviate some stress, then not much is needed apart from trusting in the outcome. But that seems to fall short of being a follower of the Triple Jewel.

Malcolm wrote:
Belief is just belief. One can believe anything, like the Red Queen, believing 100 impossible things before breakfast.

The point of Buddhadharma is verification. The Buddha invites us to verify his claims, testing them as a goldsmith examines a piece of gold.  When one has tested something one believes might be gold, and finds out it either is gold or not, then there is no ore reason for the belief.

As far as jatakas go, these are just so stories for moral edification. It is not necessary to believe they are actually past lives of the Buddha, just as it is not necessary to believe sutras and tantras are the literal words of the Buddha which sprang out of his living mouth.

All that matters is that one recognizes the three afflictions drive karma, which results in suffering. And if one is a Mahayani, to have a commitment to benefit sentient beings in whatever ways one can. If one believes in rebirth, so much the better, but it isn’t necessary.

Malcolm wrote:
This is the error of assuming the basis is only lhundrup, the first and most important error of the six mistaken positions about the basis.

Passing By said:
Could you unpack this a bit?

As I understand, the Base is kadak and from and because of kadak, the characteristics and appearances of lhundrup and thukje arise like the refractive quality of a crystal resulting in colored light or the reflective property of a mirror resulting in reflections on it. In this way, the potential for all sorts of manifestations is there and because also the Base is empty, it is uncreated and uncompounded, thus, lhundrup. Is this correct?

If that is correct, then I don't follow how Jule's statement assumes the basis is only lhundrup? After all, isn't trekcho equivalent to the fourth vision? And trekcho stems from recognizing kadak (deciding on one thing, confidence in natural liberation etc). So assuming Jules means making the definitive decision required for trekcho, then how would that be stemming from the error that the Base is only lhundrup alone?

Malcolm wrote:
Buddhahood, pg.57

The refutation states that this assertion that the basis is naturally perfect is defective. If it is claimed that at the time of the cause [the basis] is naturally perfect, the result also will be naturally perfect, [15b] like the example of butter already being naturally perfect in milk.

In the same way, is the cause established or not established in the result? If it is established, the result becomes a cause. Since a result is then pointless, the cause (deluded sentient beings) would then turn into the result (buddhas). In that case, there would be no need for anyone to make effort. If the cause is not established in the result, the assertion of the natural perfection [of the basis] is defective.

The relevant passage from the Six Dimensions:

Since the cause and result are different,
[the basis] too is not naturally perfect.
 Likewise, if the cause and result were the same, 
effort would be meaningless.


This why I explained to Jules earlier a point he does not get: even though there is buddhahood in dharmata, rig pa alone is insufficient, a guru alone is insufficient, and cultivation alone is insufficient. These three things must meet, then one can realize buddhahood.

The fact is that what we have available to us in English is a tiny fraction of the original Dzogchen teachings found in the three series. It creates a rather skewed view of Dzogchen teachings. Giving some people the idea that they only need to rely on short texts written by later scholars. Explaining something like the Treasury of Genuine Meaning or the Treasury of the Dharmadhātu takes many weeks. For example, Khenpo Namdrol explained these commentaries over many weeks each, spread out over several years. When he was alive, ChNN gave many weeks of instruction on Dzogchen teachings every year from 1976-2017. It was possible to listen to hundreds of hours of teachings by ChNN and it still is. As my teacher, ChNN stated repeatedly, Dzogchen sounds easy, but it is not so easy. He also stressed that in Dzogchen teachings understanding was more important than meditating.

But our friend Jules here thinks that proper understanding of Dzogchen teachings can be gained by quoting brief passages from tertiary literature, a brief introduction, and a few hours of instruction per year.Of course, Tsele Natsok Rangdrol was an interesting person, but he himself studied for many years and received many thousands of hours of Dzogchen instruction. He did not rely on a brief introduction, and fifteen or twenty hours of instruction per year. So the moral of the story is to be like Tsele Natsok Rangdrol, and not like Jules.

Malcolm wrote:
Not the same thing. If it were the same thing, there would be no difference between Dzogchen, Lamdre, Mahāmudra, and so on. But the fact is that the direct perception of dharmatā is unique to Dzogchen teachings, as are such teachings as four or six bardos, the six liberations, and so on.

That rig pa, a guru, and so on, are not sufficient. Many people have gurus, everyone has rig pa, and many people have intimate instructions from their gurus, and yet, lacking the introduction to the direct perception of dharmatā that does not depend on words, they still are very far away from the meaning of the Great Perfection, even if they practice very, very hard.

Just quoting words of this and that master you happen to favor is really a waste of time. It does not help anyone. You might enjoy typing them, but it is better you spent your time studying more deeply and taking teachings, rather than boasting about your personal connection with masters you imagine are realized and putting other people down.

Jules 09 said:
Really?

So, are you saying that practicing the instructions that one personally receives from a guru that holds the unbroken oral/aural lineage of transmission, that can be traced back to Garab Dorje, or Saraha, or Tilopa; is "not enough" ?


Malcolm wrote:
I said that rig pa, or a guru, etc., is not enough. As Vimalmitra observes:

Similarly, though there is buddhahood in nondual dharmatā, it does not exist in one’s vidyā alone, which is insufficient. Likewise, a guru alone is insufficient. Also, one’s cultivation is insufficient. When these three things meet [vidyā, guru, and cultivation], buddhahood is a certainty.

Not only this, but also there can be flaws in the guru's instruction, even if they have a proper lineage:

The Tantra Without Syllables, the root tantra of the veiw, states:

Therefore, it is said there are no errors in the scriptures,
but errors can arise in the intimate instructions.
pg. 148

Vimalamitra simply notes:

However, since the explanation of the instructions of the guru can be explained with or without error, it seems that errors can arise.
pg. 148

Therefore, it is incumbent upon the student to make sure the instructions they are receiving are consistent with the Dzogchen tantras and commentaries. Even upadeśas are ultimately deceptive. The only thing that counts in Dzogchen is direct perception, as Vimalamitra states:

The intimate instruction that approaches the critical points proper to direct perception does not exist [in the common upadeśas]. Since there is no buddhahood via intimate instructions, which induce a fabricated realization, all intimate instructions also do not exist. If it is asked why, it is because intimate instructions depend on words. Vidyā is free from all words. pg. 167

One needs the intimate instruction of direct perception, and that cannot rely on words:

Likewise, since the experience will arise in one’s continuum through the intimate instructions of the guru, there is liberation without needing to rely on words.
pg. 175

Without this, one simply won't be able to understand the meaning of the Great Perfection. This is one reason it is recommended one seek out a few teachers when one is beginner.

Personally, I have seen many mistaken explanations, particularly, explanations made by Western teachers.

Following objects with eyes requires a minimal amount of consciousness, this can be seen in people in vegetative state, where consciousness is functional in a basic form. While in coma there's no possibility to track objects with eyes.
It makes sense, since to track an object, a sense of discernment must be functional, and discernment it's impossible without consciousness.

Malcolm wrote:
There are two monkeys in this grotesque experiment, Ma and Mb. Mb is decapitated; Ma's head is transplanted onto the still-viable torso of Mb. Let's call this new monkey "Mf," Monkey Frankenstein. But this does not settle the question of which consciousness is now tracking objects, chewing, and so on in Mf's head—Ma's or Mb's?

Thus, the experiment does not settle the question you are seeking to answer.

Vajrasambhava said:
I think it's much more easier to address.
The consciousness in this case it's of course monkey A's. The body of Mb has to be seen as nothing more than a blood bag. This is because in the experiment just the blood vessels were sewn; no spinal cord, no nerves were attached to the Ma's head, so just blood exchange. The body functions were useless since it was just a dead detached blood pump for oxygen exchange.

Malcolm wrote:
This assumes consciousness is restricted to or located in the nervous system. In order for there to be consciousness in a body, it must breath, it must be able to take in air and turn it into prāṇa vāyu. According to tantric anatomy, consciousness is inseparable from prāṇa vāyu. Certainly it is the case that sensory functions are governed by the brain. Tibetan Buddhists have known this for over a thousand years in our medical system. But this does not address the issue of consciousness nor its location in the body. So your experiment does not prove anything at all about the location of consciousness nor which monkey's consciousness is in Mf.

More than that, however, zhentong is a specific transmission lineage stemming from Maitripa and Tsen Khawoche on the one hand and Dolpopa on the other, though the name 'zhentong' was only used after Dolpopa of course. The Maitripa tradition is described in detail in the Blue Annals. It also considers itself primarily meditative as opposed to intellectual. So to call it an intellectual fashion is quite misleading.

Team’s  lineage did not survive. Dolbupa is the person who coined the terminology, "gzhan stong," but he does not depart from Tsan's use of the three natures.

Doesn't Longchenpa mention the position here, although not in a favorable way(from Finding Rest in Illusion: https://www.shambhala.com/second-vajra- ... -illusion/ ): All phenomena are by their nature devoid of existence. In themselves, they are like space. The Middle-Length Prajñāpāramitā says, “In themselves, phenomena are like space. One can find in them no center and no boundary.” And likewise we find in the Samādhirāja-sūtra,

All things disintegrate, O Son of the Victorious One,
All existents are primordially empty.
Extremists hold a lesser emptiness.
But there is no debate between the learned and the childish.

In this regard, some say that phenomena are empty by virtue of a preclusion of something that they do not possess 55 but that they are not empty of themselves. 56 This is like saying that the sun is empty of darkness but is not empty of rays of light. This is a lesser kind of emptiness, however, through which no freedom would ever be possible from the belief in the true existence of things. Examined according to the argument of “neither one nor many,” the sun is empty of inherent existence; being thus, it is also empty of rays of light. It is empty and yet it appears. This is the very principle and essence of Madhyamaka, the Middle Way.

As for the kayas and wisdoms being present in the basis, the argument against the basis being naturally perfected [lhun grub] directly contradicts gzhan stong.

Like Khenpo Shenga, I just don’t think gzhan stong is coherent precisely because of how the yogacara doctrine of the three natures is misused by Dolbupa and others. As we see in Longchenpa, and Gorampa as well, there is a definitive understanding of tathagatagarbha which is consistent with prasanga. We do not need to resort to the intellectually impoverished idea presented by stong gzugs, which he repeats from earlier scholars, that the gzhan stong view is a post-equipoise view where so called relative phenomena are intrinsically empty and ultimate phenomena are extrinsically empty.

Also, a good friend who has spend the past five years living in Golok and Kham told me that most Jonangpas that he knows do not actually subscribe to gzhan stong at all, and also prefer Gorampa's perspective.

Speaking of mind, prasangika is an intellectual activity and gzhanstong goes beyond mind.

Malcolm wrote:
No it doesn't. It is also just a kind of analysis based on tenets, especially, since, as you claim it is a post-equipoise conceptual position:

stong gzugs said:
Second, in the context of post-meditation, you should make precise distinctions, which means you should be a rangstongpa regarding things that are intrinsically empty and a gzhanstongpa regarding that which is extrinsically empty.

Malcolm wrote:
Properly speaking, the point of prasanga is to remove errors present in Buddhist schools.

gZhan stong is such a tragic mishmash, trying, in post-equipoise, to apply the three natures to the two truths, etc., which is why it is so easy to point out its internal contradictions.

stong gzugs said:
The two are simply not in the same class of methods or views. Gzhanstong is the experience of Kālacakra yogis and simply cannot be reached by those working with mind. When you practice yoga, you withdraw your senses from the dualistic world and then buddha nature itself begins to be revealed directly to your non-conceptual perception which takes you entirely beyond subject/object duality and intellectualizing.

Malcolm wrote:
Your claim is quite uncertain. Dudjom Rinpoche writes in the Big Red Book, pg. 301:

Although path through which this reality is actualised is superior only in mantra, on further examination the lower ways of mantra consist merely of symbolic and non-symbolic stages [of meditation]. The Six Limbed Yoga of Kalacakra, which is renowned as supreme in the Unsurpassed tantras, the Five Stages, and others, too, merely explain the ten signs of radiance and the form of emptiness which is a reflection of the three spheres of existence within a black outline. These are perceived by controlling the activity of the energy channels. the currents, and the seminal points. As the experience of the perception increases and decreases, even one who has meditated appropriately cannot attain the body of indestructible reality in which the elements have dissolved into light. Thus, those of lowly fortune contact herein not the defintive meaning but the merely the provisional meaning. So it is said by Naropa:

The single definitive means is the truth of the nucleus.
The four successive seals and the six-limbed yoga,
the diverse vehicles of thought, 
have resorted to the provisional and not the definitive, etc.,

Further, your claim about the six-limb yoga being a practice beyond the mind is very questionable. Pratyahāra, sense withdrawal, is just resting in a nonconceptual mind. It is not going beyond mind. Why? Longchenpo points out in his Treasury of Citations:

In brief, all meditations with and without support are included. ‘With support” refers to any objects of external appearance such as form, sound, scent, taste, and touch upon which one focuses the mind without distraction, like focusing the mind on a statue of a deity, a hand implement, a stick, a stone, and so on. “Without support” refers to mental objects—those with appearances such as wishing for nonconceptuality after focusing the mind on individual visualizations of the nāḍīs and bindus of vāyu, {414} like syllables, balls of light, nāḍī cakras, the fire of caṇḍaḹI, and so on; that is, focusing on the sequence of mental activities. Those meditations without appearances are sitting cross-legged, and so on, directing the mind, and gazing without distraction in a state without any concepts. This is focusing on a nonconceptual state of blank voidness. In general, objects of focus are included in the explanation that includes conceptual and nonconceptual objects. In brief, all assertions of a state of a single reference point are called “meditation.” The essence of those is a calm mind. The purpose is hoping for a result by stabilizing that [calm mind]. The function is the wish for the cessation of subject and object...These maintain the object of focus through the wish for the cessation of subject and object. Since they are an approach to control thoughts, they are a method of being introduced to the profound Dharma, but they are not the profound actual yoga...

This is confirmed by what you write:

stong gzugs said:
When you practice yoga, you withdraw your senses from the dualistic world and then buddha nature itself begins to be revealed directly to your non-conceptual perception which takes you entirely beyond subject/object duality and intellectualizing.

Malcolm wrote:
So you are mistaking methods of arresting conceptuality for being the actual profound yoga itself. Longchenpa continues with his point about distinguishing paths based on mind, and the Great Perfection:

For as long as mind is employed as the path, when effort is made in the practice of meditating a calm mind, it will exist. When the effort is dropped, [the calm mind] will perish— that is its actual nature. For as long as the pristine consciousness of vidyā is employed as the path, since it abides in the stream of naturally occurring concentration, qualities will arise naturally, and those will be present at all times without any possibility of being separate from them. In that case, though the nonconceptual mind sustained by a great meditator and the nonconceptuality of the yogi’s naked recognition of vidyā are similarly nonconceptual, [in the former case,] if the key points such as the posture of the body, and so on, for nonconceptual mind are dropped, [that nonconceptual mind] will perish, and also [vidyā] will not be exposed nakedly. Nonconceptual vidyā is the complete opposite of that.

stong gzugs said:
Gzhanstong can be applied just as well to Māhāmudra (and thus trekchö). Tögal is not as straightforward because there are different views about how to interpret visual experiences which was discussed heavily somewhere in this thread.

Malcolm wrote:
If one has this idea, "Second, in the context of post-meditation, you should make precise distinctions, which means you should be a rangstongpa regarding things that are intrinsically empty and a gzhanstongpa regarding that which is extrinsically empty," one is very far away the meaning of the Great Perfection.

Though if someone is a virgin, then it of course seems ideal to receive it in person, with the acknowledgement in words that this is happening and so on.

What Chogyal Namkhai Norbu explained as this: one should regard all of one's master's conduct as instruction. But direct introduction is something very precise and specific. It is not something just happens spontaneously (though now of course someone will contradict me and claim the opposite). For example:

Nyoshul Lungtok had not asked him anything that evening, and Patrul Rinpoche called him over, saying: “Didn’t you tell me that you still hadn’t got the main point of the practice of Dzogchen?” Nyoshul Lungtok replied: “Yes, that’s right”.
“It’s very simple”, he said, and lying down on the ground, he beckoned to him: “My son, come and lie down here like your father”. So Nyoshul Lungtok did so. Then Patrul Rinpoche asked him, in a very affectionate way: “Do you see the stars in the sky?”
“Yes”.
“Do you hear the dogs barking from the Dzogchen monastery?”
“Yes.”
“Do you hear what I am saying to you?”
“Yes.”
“Well, the nature of Dzogpachenpo is just—simply this.”
At this moment, everything fell into place, and instantaneously Nyoshul Lungtok was completely realized.

You see in this case, Nyoshul had very intellectual ideas, and Patrul knew how to collapse his student's fabrications through this experience of clarity. But this is not spontaneous, this arose after many months of teachings, etc. Someone is likely to bring up the shoe and Naropa, again, the result, in this case of many years of training under Tilopa. The point is that in these cases, realizing the primordial state is not just some function of some yoga's enlightened vibe that students can then imbibe. It's the result of working with the teachings in an open and honest way, without a lot of concepts.

If everyone understood the main points, and was prepared in a proper way, then it would work. If not, then not. In this case the practice was a practice of guru yoga that included direct introduction. The main limitation we have in this instance is time, not distance. Why? Because we live in time, we are not beyond time. Even our teachers are not beyond time, not even the Buddha. If he was, he would still be present among us. Since are limited by time, some coordination is necessary.

The problem is that these kinds of things easily become meaningless rituals if people do not truly understand what is involved. Even direct introduction can become an empty ritual, and worse, a crutch. The main job of a Dzogchen practitioner, once they have been introduced, is to introduce themself with various methods again and again until their doubt is removed. The reason there are so many different methods and styles of introduction, from simple explanation to full scale major empowerments, is that people are different and have differing expectations.

Yes. He was participating in a specific practice which we would all do together in different places around the world at the same time. This state of affairs only continued for a very short time.

Again, if there was some realized dzogchen yogi with great compassion for beings, if such a thing is effective enough, I don't quite understand why they shouldn't or wouldn't just say, "Every week at 5 PM on Friday, you can put on that recording, and I will be in the state of contemplation with the appropriate intention. This will serve as direct introduction for anyone with a sincere interest that tunes in at that time with the proper intention."

Malcolm wrote:
There needs to be some kind of experience that everyone participates in, including the teacher, on the basis of an explanation of the principles involved, which they have clearly understood. I am not sure why you are not understanding this point. For example, we use the experience of bliss in a tantric empowerment.

ThreeVows said:
Again, perhaps there are reasons not to do so, for example related to not establishing connections with beings without a sincere interest, related to how if it is a more infrequent thing then there is the opportunity for people to sort of build up appropriate merit and sort of interest in the event, etc. But from a sort of technical point of view, and a coarse point of view, I see no reason why some compassionate teacher in today's day and age wouldn't or couldn't do that, and that would hypothetically allow any number of people to get pointing out.

But what is happening in Dzogchen is one is being introduced to a state of knowledge. You never find the word "transmit" (gzhan du 'pho ba, lit. shift to another) in Dzogchen texts. You find the word "introduce" (ngo sprod). What ChNN was trying point out is that there is a continuum of knowledge being introduced, from inferential knowledge, which is conceptual, to direct perception, which is nonconceptual. Is Rinpoche's contemplation a necessary component? Of course. Is it something he is transmitting this to others, shifting it to his students. No. Is it supporting others? I sure think so. But it is secondary factor. The main factor is that one discovers one's own state and rests in that knowledge.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, just in the same way that the knowledge of the word empowerment is communicated based on the experience of the bliss of the third empowerment. So-called direct introduction, the famous rig pa'i rtsal dbang, is just an elaborated version of the fourth empowerment, albeit, not restricted to using the experience of bliss, it can also be based on the experience of clarity or nonconceptuality.

The problem here is the english idea of "transmission." The Tibetan term he was using for "transmission" was "lineage" (brgyud). There are three lineages in Dzogchen teachings and in Nyingma in general, which are often framed in a historical context: Samanatbhadra --> Vajrasattva --> Garab Dorje (dgongs brgyud, usually translated as mind lineage, though this is incorrect); Garab Dorje --> Mañjuśrīmitra, etc.(symbolic transmission, brda brgyud)--> to Nyan --> (aural lineage, snyan brgyud). From this point of view, all we have is the snyan brgyud, the aural lineage and it is all we can access. But ChNN had a slightly different understanding of these three terms, and sought to clarify what he felt was the real purport and he termed the dgongs brgyud "direct transmission."  This is due to an ambiguity in the term brgyud, which meens "connecting one after another without interruption." For example a road from Lhasa to Beijing is a considered a "brgyud." This is also why it has to be live and experiential.

For example, we say there is a lineage from dharmakāya Samantabhadra, to sambhogakāya Vajrasattva, and thence to nirmāṇakāya Garab Dorje, which we call the "rgyal ba dgongs brgyud," the lineage of the transcendent state of the victors. But the truth is that this is not really a lineage in any historical sense, unlike the Dzogchen lineage from Garab Dorje onward. This is why he says we use Ati Guru yoga to be in that state together at the same time. This state is the state of the dgongs pa, the transcendent state, of all buddhas. It is something we discover, it is not something properly speaking, that is transmitted in a dualistic manner. It is something the guru assists us in discovering for ourselves individually, but it does not come from the guru. That's impossible.

It does seem reasonable enough that there is a sort of power, a sort of magnetic power, where a teacher can sort of bring a being into 'resonance', similar to how if you take a C tuning fork and bring it next to another C tuning fork, the second fork will start vibrating with the first one. Or if someone with strong samadhi, as was mentioned, practices with someone with weaker samadhi, it may sort of bring the second person into 'resonance'.

This doesn't involve any 'transference', but in terms of our normal words and what not, I don't see any reason to resist the idea of some amount of 'telepathy' if we consider 'telepathy' to simply be some aspect of communion or communication that is more subtle than coarse physical contact or verbal contact, some more or less unseen force that most ordinary people wouldn't necessarily consider.

Malcolm wrote:
Every sentient being has the basis, but no one recognizes it without a teacher. As it is says in the Tantra Without Syllables:

"Though the nature of vidyā pervades all, the dharmakāya is encountered in the instructions.”

As such, the nature of vidyā pervades all migrating beings, but they do not understand the instructions of the guru for encountering
the dharmakāya in direct perception. Vidyā cannot be found through an intellectual analysis of the body that is searched from head to foot. On the one hand, if it is asked whether vidyā exists in the body or not, it definitely exists in the body. On the other hand, [vidyā] is not nonexistent merely because it cannot be found through being sought with intellectual analysis. You are unable to find it because you lack the intimate instructions of the guru. Similarly, gold can be shaped by anyone who knows how to work with it, but the person who does not know how to shape it, nor how to refine it, nor how to smelt it and heat it, will not be able to work with gold, no matter how much intellectual analysis they perform. On the other hand, it is not the case that the gold itself is unworkable. Since there is an intimate instruction for refining it and so on, one can work with gold. The one who lacks the intimate instructions of the guru has no hope of buddhahood.

Even if vidyā could be found through the imputation and scrutiny of intellectual analysis, it cannot be stabilized by necessary cultivation because it cannot be known whether one has indeed found vidyā or not.  Therefore, in the beginning, a pure guru is very important. Afterward, one’s own cultivation and familiarity is very important.

Fire is produced through the meeting of two things: the meeting of a person’s hands with a spindle. Fire does not exist in the spindle,
[90b] nor does it exist in the hands of the person. Fire arises when three things meet: the hand, the spindle, and the fireboard. Similarly, though there is buddhahood in nondual dharmatā, it does not exist in one’s vidyā alone, which is insufficient. Likewise, a guru alone is insufficient. Also, one’s cultivation is insufficient. When these three things meet [vidyā, guru, and cultivation], buddhahood is a certainty.

He was always quite explicit that distance did not matter, but that live participation was essential, and that one could not receive transmissions of any kind, including lungs, from recordings. One label it a dogma if one likes, but those who claim empowerments and lungs can be received from recordings have no justification for their position for many reasons that I have explained elsewhere.

Before webcasts, ChNN coordinated direct introductions by means of video tape three time a year on “transmission day,” where he would watch, and people in different places would watch, all doing the empowerment practice together at the same time, having had the procedure explained to them before hand. ChNN maintained always that distance was not an issue, only time.

Alex is mistaken in so far there is no basis for assuming mind to mind communication between people who lack the capacity of knowing the minds of others. The Buddha could not place the state of awakening in unawakened peoples minds. If he could, he would have done so.

Alex’s objection is based on a misunderstanding. He fails to understand the intended point, which is that direct transmission (dgongs brgyud), or transcendent state lineage, refers not really to a transmission, but the discovery of the transcendent state (dgongs) of the sugatas, which is necessary in order to practice the four chokzhag. This is what direct introduction is for, that’s all, based on the aural transmission or lineage, (snyan brgyud) and the symbolic transmission or lineage (brda brgyud).

One has to understand what this dgongs pa is, in order to understand the point being made.

Dgongs refers to tan uninterrupted concentration, beyond temporary, contrived mental one-pointedness and sessions. We can discover this for ourselves, based on working with a qualified teacher. We don’t receive this from a teacher.  We discover this for ourselves by collaborating with a teacher, and preparing ourselves through listening to and understanding the words and symbols of the explanation. It’s is an active process of collaboration. The teacher has something to do, as does the student. The teacher explains, the student listens, and then student tries to discover that knowledge for themselves while the teacher is present with them, based on the experiences of bliss, clarity, or nonconceptuality.

If Jim continued practicing these instructions without ever again sitting with a teacher in the same state of dzogchen at the same time, is there anything stopping him from completing the path because he didn't?

Malcolm wrote:
He isn't missing anything. There is no problem with this, since by receiving the first two transmissions he is now properly ripened and can practice various dzogchen methods because the teacher in this instance is communicating that teaching from their authentic knowledge. And since we are using experiences, for example, like bliss in the third empowerment, the nature of which is then pointed out in the fourth, there is in fact an underlying experience the student can carry with them on the path, even if they were not able to enter into knowledge of their own state.

And there is nothing to impede this person from realizing the path later. Most people in fact discover their own state after having received transmission and then go practice on their own.

However, there is a reason to meet with one's teacher again. For example, if someone is weak in caṇḍalī yoga, what do you do? You get four other yogis who are strong in the practice and they practice together, seating the weaker practitioner in the center of the group. This will reinforce the capacity of the weaker person. If a weaker musician plays with a better musician, they will also become better. Similarly, when one practices guru yoga with one's teacher, even if one has already discovered one's primordial state, one's contemplation will become stronger, just as ten candles will shed more light in toto than one candle will on its own.

It is well known among yogis that being in the presence of someone who has strong samadhi can induce samadhi in others. But that does not mean that samadhi has been transferred mystically from one person to another.

1) IF you want remote transmission via electronic systems to be deemed valid (I don't) AND you want them to be deemed invalid if delayed (even when what is shown to the student is EXACTLY the same) THEN you have to accept some kind of supra-physical inter-mental interaction.

Malcolm wrote:
I am not having it both ways, as you put it. The point is simple--for direct transmission, the student and the teacher, using specific experiences, need to be in the same knowledge at the same time. It really just means that the student discovers their own state, or enters their own state, at the same time the teacher is resting in their own state, like lighting two candles and placing them together. Candle a does not illuminate candle b, but when they are together, the light is brighter.

That state transcends duality, but the reason it does not transcend time is that we students and teachers are limited in time. For example, ChNN asked his teacher  Changchub Dorje for an empowerment. Changchub Dorje replied, "I already gave you empowerment in my dream." ChNN replied, "But that was your dream, I did not experience that empowerment." The Changchub Dorje understood that ChNN was stuck in a limitation, as we all are until we achieve total realization.

Malcolm wrote:
If you paid attention to what ChNN said, that communication comes from oral and symbolic transmission, "The third method, the direct transmission, implies that one already has knowledge of the oral and symbolic transmission. Through these two, one has an idea of how to enter into the real nature, then by using different experiences together, and entering into that real nature at the same moment as the teacher, then there is the real possibility that one also receives the direct transmission."

My point, however still stands. If the validity of the transmission depends at least in part on the state of the lama's mind at the time, and if a remotely viewing participant can receive that transmission through this weak collaboration, but a remotely viewing participant receiving exactly the same digital input from a recording at a later time cannot because the lama is doing something else, then there must be some supra-physical emission radiating from the lama's mind reaching out across space (though not time) and affecting the students.

I don't yet understand why the teacher must be resting in the state the moment the student watches the instruction video, if we've set aside the telepathy stuff and the practical concerns about maintaining lineages. [/quote]

It has to do with being in the same state of nondual knowledge at the same time where there is no perception of a duality between one's own state and the teacher's state. It is the joining the teacher in a state of nondual contemplation that is the key, even if only for a moment. The primordial state is identical in all sentient beings. The ability to discover that state however depends on transmission from a teacher.

Thanks for the additional clarification. I guess statements like this quoted one above are what are confusing to me (and likely others on here). Another example: A teacher is resting in the state, gives the instructions which are relayed by video to one room of students in real-time, and relayed to another room of students immediately after the teacher has ended the instruction (but this room has no idea they are receiving the video on a delay). Why does the second room not get the introduction? If there's nothing "telepathic" why does the teacher have to be resting in the state when the video is being watched (which seems to imply something telepathic), rather than just when it is being recorded (which makes sense because then all the teacher is saying and doing is an expression of the state of dzogchen)?

This is helpful, thanks! But I guess it depends what you mean by "collaboration." In a one-on-one setting, the teacher is explaining and giving real-time instructions, the student is attempting to practice them, perhaps asking questions to the teacher, the teacher is responding to the questions and noticing how the student is practicing, which s/he responds to, etc... A teacher provides instructions while remaining in the state of dzogchen. A student attempts to practice those instructions, and hopefully realizes that state for him/herself. Why does it matter that they're doing these two activities at the same time (given that there isn't the kind of two-way back and forth)?

Malcolm wrote:
If the teacher is not in the state of contemplation when they are giving so-called "direct introduction," it is not authentic and no introduction is given at all. They are just repeating words. In this case, as I explain above, it is better that this person give a more formal empowerment, where at least a dependent origination is set up in a more formal way. The point is that the teacher has to give this through their authentic knowledge of Dzogchen contemplation while they are in that state of contemplation. But it is not the case they are transmitting some entity from one mind to another called "contemplation."

Since there is no teacher resting in a state of contemplation during a recording, it is just a recording; just as there is no mandala present during a recording since the mandala has been already dismantled.

But the point is the teacher is giving those two introductions (oral and symbolic) from within the state of authentic knowledge of the state of Dzogchen (meaning they have actually realized the state of contemplation in question, called dgongs pa). As it happens, the student is often not capable of recognizing this state of knowledge, the transcendent state (dgongs pa) at the moment of introduction. This means they only received the oral and symbolic transmissions, and not the dgongs rgyud, the transmission of Dzogchen contemplation. Even so, they are then authorized to use Dzogchen methods to discover this state for themselves.

If the teacher cannot give introduction while resting in this state of contemplation (dgongs pa) or lacks confidence, it is better the teacher relies on a ritual method of giving Dzogchen transmission, such as an a formal empowerment, and so on.

heart said:
The vidya that recognise the basis is not obscured, it is just not recognised.

Malcolm wrote:
Actually, it is. What is never obscured is the basis itself.

The conscious aspect of the basis can be deluded. If we follow your system, one could never become deluded. Further, there would be knowledge (rig pa) and ignorance (ma rig pa) of the same thing (the basis) at the same time. In Buddhahood it is stated:

heart said:
Since that so-called ‘the knower’ ( rig pa po ) or ‘the mind’ (the assertion of a special awareness demonstrated in our own texts) is deluded, for it example, that delusion that white smoke is yellow is a delusion of the eye, likewise, that [eye] becomes self-deluded.
I feel it is pretty strange to distinguish the vidya that recognise the basis and the basis it self because then there is an obvious duality. Most masters when they say rigpa, they actually mean the basis recognised.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct, when the basis is recognized, then there is vidyā. When it is not recognized, there is ignorance. But it is the same thing which is either recognizing or not recognizing the basis.

This is why we have the explanation of the ignorance of the same identical cause (not knowing one's own state, like being in deep asleep), the connate ignorance (nonrecognition of the appearances that arise from the basis, like being in a dream and not recognizing it), and the ignorance of imputation (our normal, everyday, waking, deluded vision).

The point is this really——that nonrecognition is transient. It is not inherent to the conscious aspect of the basis. That very state of nonrecognition is proof that vidyā is not contaminated, just as jaundiced vision is proof that one can see correctly when the jaundice is removed.  Vidyā is not inherently obscured. So sometimes we talk about mind, which arises from the contamination of the radiance of rig pa by karmic vāyus, for example. When those winds cease, the mind ceases, etc., and rig pa is exposed. When we say that rig pa has never been deluded, is not deluded, and can never be deluded, we are talking about the actual nature of the mind, which obscurations can never contaminate inherently In other words, while rig pa is permanent, ignorance is impermanent once ignorance's own real nature as rig pa is discovered.

Buddahood, pp. 47-48, states

As such, from not recognizing that rig pa and ma rig pa have the same cause, like the front and back of one’s hand, the
ma rig pa of the same identical cause arises from not coming to the ultimate nonduality. The connate that arises from that is a term of duality i.e. as soon as the conceit occurs “this is originally pure”, it is inseparable from that ma rig pa. Thus ma rig pa depends on rig pa. Delusion depends on non-delusion. As such, rig pa itself becomes ma rig pa That non-delusion becomes delusion. From that grasping subject and objects arises.

No, but the point is that divine pride is not related to visualizing anything. It is the strong identification, "I am [insert name of deity here].

For example, we have Yamantaka Vajrabhairava and his protector, but in reality, neither have a bulls head. The class of beings called Yamas have this appearance, which to us appears as a water buffalo head, but in reality, they do not have water buffalo heads.

Also, Tibetan thankha images depict Tibetan imaginations, just as the earlier Nepalese paintings represent Nepalese imaginations, for example this representation of Palden Lhamo from the 14th century:

As opposed to this on from the 17th century:

These representations are conceptual approximations. I am sure we can visualize a lion face dakini in a modern context without relying on these earlier ideas.

HHDL is not to blame for Sogyal's sybaritic lifestyle. It's just too much to expect. Tibetan Buddhism is not a top down organization like Catholicism. It is rhizomatic and there is no complaint department. It is on the student to make sure their teacher is qualified. This is stated in too many texts to mention. Unless the teacher's conduct crosses the line into criminal behavior (as in the Spatz case), there is not much any lineage head can do. HHDL stated many times that people should go to the newspapers if they felt a teacher's conduct warranted it.

Interesting end to this discussion for me. I went to sleep and dreamed that I was spending a lot of time with ChNNR. He was living in the very north of my country and was very available. We where eating together and but I only remember discussing things like "panini" and that Rinpoche wanted one. When I woke up this morning from that dream I had clear understanding what khroda and Malcolm was trying to say in my mind. That all the different modalities of rigpa are the same rigpa and so on makes perfect sense. However I still feel there is no need to mature and ripen anything. No need to change or improve anything in the rigpa that recognise the basis.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct, there is no need to ripen or change anything, unripened rig pa is a term for rig pa which has not been pointed out.

krodha said:
Although Longchenpa does at the very least say vidyā is “matured” along the path.

Tshig don mdzod:

de yang gzhi nas ’phags pa’i rig pa sa bon lta bu grol ’khrul gang byed ma nges pas ma smin pa’i rig pa zhes bya ste/ /sangs rgyas su smin par byed pa ni rtogs pa’i shes rab kyis byas te    

Furthermore, since the vidyā [rig pa] that arises from the basis is like a seed, uncertain to produce either liberation or delusion, it is called “unripened vidyā”: that which will mature it into full buddhahood is the prajñā of realization.

Khenpo Jikphun commentary by way of Jean-Luc Achard:

Therefore this state of vidyā [rig pa] is styled as “unripened” [ma smin pa] because it has not yet been “brought to maturity” through the prajñā or sublime knowledge that realises its very nature.

Seems to suggest there is a process of maturation or “ripening” that is occurring from (i) the time that we merely identify a moment of unfabricated consciousness, to (ii) realizing emptiness at third vision where the prajñā of realization is first encountered, to (iii) finally buddhahood at the time of the result. For example.

Malcolm wrote:
This prajña of realization is not the third vision. It occurs when rigpa is nakedly exposed. Otherwise, the path would not work. Here, in this context Longchenpa is discussing rig pa at the time of the arising of the basis, in the section on the liberation of Samantabhadra and the delusion of sentient beings.

The context that Vimalamitra cites the term in the context of a sentient being who is still subject to transmigration, but we know that anyone who nakedly exposes rig pa in a direct perception will no longer continue in samsara and will achieve realization in this life, the time of death, the bardo, or in a buddhafield.

There is only one rigpa under discussion here, not two. As Longchenpa says in Stainless Space:

The essence of mind is the radiance of vidyā which is mounted on the vāyu.

In addition, when mind comes and goes, vidyā is not truly evident. When vidyā remains in its own radiance, mind is not evident, seeming as though when one arises, the other ceases. However, when vidyā is stable, because the radiance of vidyā dissolves into the basis, mind ceases for a moment.

Surely if there was nothing to be matured/ripened, if that first glimpse was fully qualified, one would be an arya immediately upon the initial recognition of vidya, which we know is not the case for practically everyone.

heart said:
I already answered this. Once you recognised vidya in direct introduction the path is to familiarise yourself with that vidya. Vidya isn't matured or ripened it is only prolonged. And also if you don't get a "fully qualified" experience of vidya during direct introduction then you didn't get it.

Malcolm wrote:
Vimalamitra states in the Lamp that Summarizes Vidyā in the Variegated Syllables section of the Vima Nyingthig:

heart said:
3.1 The vidyā that apprehends characteristics [when one is a beginner], called “the vidyā that nominally designates generic and specific phenomena,” is merely one’s clear and nonconceptual consciousness known to oneself, contaminated with many cognitions.

3.2 The [vidyā that] appropriates the basis [226] generates all the consciousnesses when present in one’s body and abides as mere intrinsic clarity. This is called “unripened vidyā,”

3.3 The vidyā of the abiding basis is the reality of the essence, original purity, that exists possessing the three pristine consciousnesses. The vidyā which is not covered by partiality [endowed with the nature of the pristine consciousness of compassion] is present as the essence of omniscient pristine consciousness...

3.4 The vidyā of insight is those vivid appearances when the instruction is demonstrated. It is called “the self-appearance endowed with the essence of the bindu."...

3.5 The vidyā of thögal is [227] the absence of increase or decrease in experience, having reached the full measure of appearance...

Are those [five] vidyās different or not? They are not different because there is nothing more than a single essence.

Malcolm wrote:
As for the relationship between vidyā and the three kāyas, he continues:

heart said:
To confirm vidyā as the three kāyas: Vidya is empty and not established in any way. That also is the dharmakāya [which does not exist somewhere else]. It appears as clear and diverse, however, it is also natureless. That also is the sambhogakāya [which does not exist somewhere else]. Its various deeds are the play of compassion. That also is the nirmāṇakāya [which does not exist somewhere else]. [229] The three kāyas of vidyā are called “innate attributes.” When vidyā is still, the three kāyas are called “the transcendent state of the dhātu of the basis.” When vidyā arises, the three kāyas are called “the transcendent state that arises from the basis.” When vidyā is liberated, the three kāyas are called “the transcendent state of total liberation.” When vidyā is purified, the three kāyas are called “the transcendent state of original purity” [having reached the state of exhaustion].

Malcolm wrote:
Based on this we can understand the three kāyas are innate attributes of rig pa. Not only this, but we can understand that the three kāyas are just path experiences that exist in the basis, but not in the result.

heart said:
However, as aspects of clarity, the appearances of the path are not the result. [56b] In response to the question of why the appearances of the path are not the result, since they are illuminated for the doorway of the pure essence of the sense organ of the eye, the apparent aspect of the lamp is the path. Since the exponential increase of experience is the sambhogakāya, and vidyā reaching its full measure is the dharmakāya, the three kāyas are explained to be path appearances.

Malcolm wrote:
Blazing Lamp, pg. 130

heart said:
Furthermore, (1) the pristine consciousness of one’s vidyā is not within the range of wisdom; (2) it cannot be confirmed with words; (3) it cannot be sullied by misdeeds; [69a] (4) it cannot be improved through virtues; (5) it lacks distinction between sharp and dull faculties; (6) the three kāyas and the five pristine consciousnesses are not the result, but the path; and (7) delusion is the companion of the path, pristine consciousness. These seven points indicate the superiority of
the Natural Great Perfection over the common vehicles.

Today, a teacher who behaved like Trungpa would not last five minutes. And even in the 70's there was considerable negative press about him. Negative press dogged Sogyal as well. Nevertheless, Sogyal's book sold millions of copies and in it many people were introduced to the Dharma.

This is why we shouldn’t always be so quick to judge on these kinds of controversies.

PeterC said:
There have been many studies of the rate of “false reporting” of rape by women, and the estimates for the rate of this range from 2-8% of accusations.  The FBI’s estimate is 8%.

However the rate of unreported rapes is extremely high. Estimates for the percentage of female victims that never report rape are typically around 80%.  The most common reasons given for this are that women are often not believed, reporting can be more damaging socially to the victim than to the rapist, etc.

So sure, everyone is innocent until proven guilty, etc.  But when a woman says they’ve been raped, it’s overwhelmingly likely that they have been: and we should be encouraging women to come forward and report abuse by supporting them, not meeting reports with blanket statements like “she could be lying because she wanted money”.

Many rape cases end up in he said / she said due to lack of evidence. However in this case, we have a lot of corroborating evidence.  There was an alleged pregnancy.  She spoke to other members of the sangha, and their response seems to indicate that they were aware of a problem.  A reasonable person looking at these facts would conclude that it’s overwhelmingly likely that she was assaulted.

Malcolm wrote:
Indeed:

PeterC said:
32. For every 1000 rapes in the US, 995 perpetrators will go unpunished.
Studies covering unreported sexual assault statistics show that the overwhelming majority of perpetrators will escape punishment of any kind.US rape stats show that too many victims are afraid to follow through with the legalities of their claim, leading to perpetrators escaping punishment of any form.

Just like an example jñāna, as the mere clarity of mind, the vidyā of direct introduction is also just the mere clarity of mind that we fuse with the “view” in order to ripen that vidyā with the prajñā of realization so that it becomes the “knowledge of the essence [snying po] that permeates all which is free of avidyā.”

Sorry man, I don't buy that. Direct introduction gives a short experience of “knowledge of the essence [snying po] that permeates all which is free of avidyā” but it doesn't last long.

krodha said:
If you’re very ripe, that may occur. The vast, vast majority does not have that degree of insight during direct introduction, and they don’t need to. All that is required is recognizing a moment of unfabricated consciousness [ma bcos pa'i shes pa skad cig ma]. Or vidyā in a direct perception, but both are just unripened vidyā.

heart said:
So when "deciding on one point" all aspect of samsara arise as experience of body, speech and mind but one keep returning to the “knowledge of the essence", thus deciding on that.

krodha said:
“Deciding on one point” just means you understand the continuum of vidyā is where buddhahood occurs, and nowhere else. All one has to do is to mature that unripened vidyā and buddhahood is a guarantee. That is all “deciding on one point” means.

That is why Vimalamitra makes this statement:
Fire is produced through the meeting of two things: the meeting of a person’s hands with a spindle. The fire does not exist in the spindle, nor does it exist in the hands of the person. Fire arises when three things meet: the hand, the spindle, and the fireboard. Similarly, though there is buddhahood in nondual dharmatā, it does not exist in one’s vidyā alone, which is insufficient. Likewise, a guru alone is insufficient. Also, one’s cultivation is insufficient. When these three things meet [vidyā, guru, and cultivation], buddhahood is a certainty.
You must “cultivate” i.e., ripen and mature the vidyā that the guru introduces you to and then buddhahood is a certainty. But vidyā alone without cultivation is not enough, just like an example jñāna alone without cultivation is insufficient.

I know this thread has drifted away from the original question, as almost always happens, so if the mods want to split parts of it off that's fine by me. But in the meantime...

Having been a bit puzzled by Tata1's comment that In dzogchen the 3 kayas are path experiences,
and having had light shed by Gyurme Kundrol's comment that It just means that at the time of the fourth vision, *all* phenomena including the three kayas dissolve back into the basis. Dzogchen considers that the attainment of the third vision is the attainment of dharmakaya as a path experience.
I find myself still a little uneasy.

This may be just because of the way, ever and again, things stated on internet forums come across with a different flavour from what was intended, but my first sticking point is in the two apparently simple words "in dzogchen..." Now I am well aware that dzogchen texts often slant their terminology in a unique way, and that it is plain that there is a considerable body of text and teaching that can usefully be described as "dzogchen". What worries me is the way those words suggest (to me, at any rate), that there is a monolithic - I'm tempted to say monocrystalline - body of text and teaching with a sharp and uncontested boundary from other related text and teaching that can be called "dzogchen", within which the usage of terms is fully consistent, or even defined, so that context other than being "in dzogchen" is unimportant. This would be as if any one technical term had just one clear and unvarying meaning across the whole of dzogchen. This would - obviously, in the light of dzogchen's extended history - be impossible, unless the title of "dzogchen" is reserved for a very small subset of what is generally called dzogchen. The rest would then be "not true dzogchen", a rather well-known fallacy.

Malcolm informed us that this idea (that in dzogchen the 3 kayas are path experiences) is stated in the "Self arisen vidya Tantra". Given that this is a dense text, and not a short one, it would be great if we could know the page and line number. I'm referring to Malcolm's own translation, of course.

My inability to quite swallow this whole was underlined, quite by chance, yesterday, as I was looking at the Chöying Dzöd, more specifically at Longchen Rabjam's autocommentatary. Now again I'm aware that Richard Barron's translation is, by now, felt to be in need of improvement, and I should also make clear that I know, in particular, that the translation of rigpa as "awareness" is a particular bête noir of Malcolm's, who is, after all, a big cheese here at this site. So while I'm open to correction and to hearing further explanations, it seems hard to imagine that the central gist of The fruition, self-knowing awareness free of distortion, is sacred dharmakaya..
(p.6, second-last paragraph) does not, even on the basis of an imagined, improved translation, identify the fruition with the dharmakaya.

This would all be a nothing, provided I/we can back off from a simplistic (in the older sense) scheme of perfectly distinct and perfectly self-consistent body of "dzogchen" and replace the quote that niggles me with In some dzogchen teaching, the 3 kayas are often viewed as path experiences
.

Perhaps I'm just splitting hairs-

Malcolm wrote:
I’ll be happy to provide you with many references, page numbers and all. I am in NYC right now and not at home, but I assure you this is how Dzogchen presents the kayas since they are present as the basis. The result, needless to say, is just realizing the original basis.

I was just hoping august would tell us his reasons, simply to better understand. But he's obviously decided not to, which is fine.

Last week I was talking to my friend. He's a 40 yo white man, a surgeon, from a family of successful, highly educated people. He was almost literally in tears about how he's become obsolete in this world, because of being a white man. I could feel his pain; it was real. Yet somehow, amazingly, he wasn't able to make the connection that this is how many groups of people (women, minorities, disabled etc) have been feeling since time immemorial. (?!) And when I kept trying to point that out, it was just "yes but" over and over again.

PadmaVonSamba said:
There’s no such thing in Buddhism as being “worthy” of compassion.
The reason why people who do bad things should be the object of compassion is because  they and all other beings what they do for the same reasons that Buddhists do what they do: they are suffering and desire to be free from suffering. It doesn’t matter what their past was. Mahayana Buddhists aim to attain full realization in order to free all beings from suffering.

The whole thing about while people becoming extinct or whatever is just right wing propaganda bullsht and everybody should know that.

Ultimately, all identity issues, race, gender, etc are just projections of self-grasping. It’s still all basically samsaric bickering, then you die. The only reason to make preferences, to support this cause or that cause, is because within the scope of this general ignorance and self-clinging, additional suffering is created. In other words, for example, even though there is nothing that can truly be identified as ‘race’, there is racism, and the ignorance of racism creates conditions which are experienced as suffering. So, a Buddhist can be against racism, gender-identity discrimination etc because these things produce suffering, even with the understanding that clinging to any self-identity really only becomes the cause for more suffering.

The purpose of rushan practice is to prevent one's body, speech, and mind from returning to the three realms, and to realize the three kāyas.

The difference between this sutra version presented by a Theravadin teacher, and the investigation of the mind in rushan, is that the former is not based on having been introduced to pristine consciousness (ye shes) and the latter is.

The difference between meditation based on mind and concentration based on ye shes is discussed by Longchenpa in the opening section of chapter 10 of the commentary on the Treasury of Dharmadhātu. Simply put, if your meditation ends when you end the session, then your practice is mind-based and will not ultimately lead to the result. If your concentration continues regardless of whether you are in a session or not, then your practice is based in pristine consciousness and is already the result.

Malcolm wrote:
The alternative is mind moments that have discrete modes of arising, abiding, and ceasing, which do not stand up to Madhyamaka analysis, rendering time meaningless as well.

At least partless mind moments, perishing while they arise, can't be rejected by Madhyamaka reasonings. They cannot be simultaneous, incidentally, because they are serially dependent.

But as we know, time is a construct, and does not refer to anything real, hence the so-called fourth time, which is the union of the three times.
