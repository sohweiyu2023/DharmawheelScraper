The Buddha denied the universe was created by a supreme agency. Epicurus is regarded as an atheist, but he as well accepted the existence of various supernatural entities:

Matt J said:
Because of its denial of divine providence, Epicureanism was often charged in antiquity with being a godless philosophy, although Epicurus and his followers denied the charge. The main upshot of Epicurean theology is certainly negative, however. Epicurus’ mechanistic explanations of natural phenomena are supposed to displace explanations that appeal to the will of the gods. In addition, Epicurus is one of the earliest philosophers we know of to have raised the Problem of Evil, arguing against the notion that the world is under the providential care of a loving deity by pointing out the manifold suffering in the world.

Despite this, Epicurus says that there are gods, but these gods are quite different from the popular conception of gods. We have a conception of the gods, says Epicurus, as supremely blessed and happy beings. Troubling oneself about the miseries of the world, or trying to administer the world, would be inconsistent with a life of tranquility, says Epicurus, so the gods have no concern for us. In fact, they are unaware of our existence, and live eternally in the intermundia, the space between the cosmoi. For Epicurus, the gods function mainly as ethical ideals, whose lives we can strive to emulate, but whose wrath we need not fear.

Ancient critics thought the Epicurean gods were a thin smoke-screen to hide Epicurus’ atheism, and difficulties with a literal interpretation of Epicurus’ sayings on the nature of the gods (for instance, it appears inconsistent with Epicurus’ atomic theory to hold that any compound body, even a god, could be immortal) have led some scholars to conjecture that Epicurus’ ‘gods’ are thought-constructs, and exist only in human minds as idealizations, i.e., the gods exist, but only as projections of what the most blessed life would be.

Malcolm wrote:
The idea of gods presented above is quite similar to the Buddhist notion of devas. But Epicurus, who lived a mere 70 years or so after the Buddha’s parinirvana, was certainly called atheoi, just as the Buddha was called a nastika, the equivalent term for an atheist in ancient India, along with Carvakas, Samkhya, Jains, and so on.

So basically, you are claiming that to be an atheist is necessarily to be a physicalist along the model of Dennet, etc.

Samantabhadra is not some external buddha in a concrete sense, other than as a symbolic name for the realization of dharmakāya. Sambhogakāya likewise is just a name for realized speech, but it does not exist somewhere "out there." Buddhafields are just other planets and dimensions that have been "prepared" in some fashion by a bodhisattva on the stages.

But none of these were created by an omnipotent supreme being; moreover, our liberation does not depend on our relationship with some "savior," unlike theistic religions.

Brahma said:
In Christianity it is said that God created everything, including man, and there is a distinction made between the creator and the creature. The creature is something created by God. When I look at a rose, a tulip, or a chrysanthemum, I know, I see, I think, that this flower is a creation of God. Because I have been practicing as a Buddhist, I know that between the creator and the created there must be some kind of link, otherwise creation would not be possible. So the chrysanthemum can say that God is a flower, and I agree, because there must be the element "flower" in God so that the flower could become a reality. So the flower has the right to say that God is a flower.

Malcolm wrote:
He is actually criticizing theism in this passage. Theists maintain there is a first cause, an unmoved mover, a creator who exists apart from its creation. Here,  THT is actually engaging in what most Christians since the 3rd century CE would classically consider a heresy.

He is making that point that there must be some link between a cause and its effect, so in this respect, he is rejecting the the idea of the uncompounded creator. There are many arguments in Buddhadharma against such an uncompounded creator, which I am sure he knows well. So in this passage he is trying to lead this person into a Buddhist view. If you accept that a creator is not separate from its creation; it follows the creator, like the creation, must arise from a cause. If a creator arises from a cause, then what kind of a creator is this? Such a creator is just a noncreator, since it too is created from a cause, and is in fact an effect.

He is also saying that people tend to see ultimate principles in their own image: flowers see flowers as ultimate, etc. But it is not a defense of theism in Buddhadharma at all.

I think this is a bad definition of atheism, appearing to be designed (like with PeterC's) to exclude Buddhism. I doubt most atheists would agree that Tibetan Buddhism is atheistic, and we have at least two well established and respected teachers cited here who deny it (and probably more, especially if we were to delve into East Asian variants), showing that perhaps it is not as "profoundly" atheistic as suggested?

One can be an atheist and still accept other kinds of non-falsifiable phenomena. The term non-theist is, in my opinion, a copout.

In Buddhism, what is equivalent to God is Mind, especially the collective mind. Mind is the ground of everything; and when your mind gets in touch with the collective mind, everything is possible.

Malcolm wrote:
This has to be understood in context. What THT is referring to here is known as the ālayavijñāna, the all-basis consciousness. The all-basis consciousness is not actually a "collective" consciousness in the sense that you likely understand it. Here, in Chinese, it is understood as a "storehouse," and the function of this consciousness is actually to collect and store seeds that produce the appearance of an external and its appearances world. Some of those seeds human beings share in common, and so this produces the appearance of our human realm; devas, asuras, animals, etc., have different sets of seeds that are responsible for the appearance of their respective realms, according to this idea. Equating the all-basis consciousness with "God" is very sloppy; but he does have a lot of people who are Christians who follow him, so he is trying to make an equation for them that they will understand, in the same way that Buddha taught tathāgatagarbha to those who feared emptiness.

If you are serious, you have to learn French and German; Pali or Sanskrit; Chinese and Japanese; Tibetan; Thai, Burmese, or Cambodian, Vietnamese, etc.

I'm currently perusing  "illuminations A Guide to Essential Buddhist Practices", translated by Geshe Wangyal and Brian Cutillo. It's a book from 1988, I don't know anything about the quality of the translation.

Anyway, there is a portion on Wrong View in which Sapan goes over various wrong views, connecting many of them to the famous debate with Hashang Mahayana.

If I am reading it correctly, it's essentially a polemic against "effortless" practices as well, there is lots of talk about how you must "correct deficiencies" etc. and claiming that versions of "Mahamudra" (Dzogchen is not explicitly mentioned, but language used in Dzogchen is, and it almost feels like the term is being used synonymously) which involve viewing "the mind as clear light" are incomplete. AS an example, multiple times he criticizes meditating "without modification".

The criticism is a little opaque to me, and I cannot tell if he is contextually arguing against the essentially non-gradual approach of Dzogchen meditation proper (not preliminaries), or whether he is referring to specific deviations with which I may not be familiar. I always imagined that Sapan had some pretty specific criticisms of Dzogchen.

I have always assumed that Sarma schools and Dzogchen were somewhat irreconcilable on paper (though of course not neccessarily in practice)..again is this what I'm looking at?

Accepting the premise that pratyekabuddhas, as all beings in beginningless samsara have encountered buddhas. Does pratyekabuddha's awakening include recollection of past lives? So far the assertion has been made that pratyekabuddha do understand themselves in terms of Buddhadharma... are there any textual sources for this?

' What is sudden awakening (tongo 頓悟)? Answer: Sudden is to suddenly remove false thoughts (muunen 妄念). Awakening is to awaken to nothing to gain (mushotoku 無所得).'
( Treatise On Entering The Tao of Sudden Enlightenment; X63n1223p18a10)

'Additionally, if a person retaining the concept of there being anything to be gained (ushotoku 有所得) generates the bodhi resolve and then proceeds to cultivate kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, equanimity, giving, moral virtue, patience, vigor, dhyāna absorption, and wisdom, doing so for an incalculable number of asaṃkhyeyas of kalpas, one should realize that, on account of retaining the concept of something to be gained, such a person will not succeed in leaving behind birth and death and will not succeed in progressing towards bodhi.'

Just to add to this, FWIW, from Dudjom Rinpoche:

"...while the intention of the final transmitted precepts is not the same as that of the mundane Mind Only system in any of its forms, the purposes of the lower phases of the vehicle are gradually gathered within the higher, so that [Mind Only and the like] are not contradictory apart from their vindication of an extreme position. Indeed, one must truly comprehend that the great distinction of the higher over the lower phases is a feature of the precious teaching of the sublime Sugata. Otherwise, after one had been given teaching on suffering, selflessness, impurity and impermanence according to the first promulgation and everything had been established as emptiness according to the intermediate transmitted precepts, if one were then to grasp literally the meaningful intention revealed according to the final transmitted precepts concerning bliss, purity, permanence and true self, without knowing how to accept them with an attitude confident in the four kinds of reliance, one would engage in conceptualising thoughts which would confuse those who require training and wrongly scrutinize the teaching."


Malcolm wrote:
Sure, if you accept the scheme of the Samdhnirmocana Sūtra as defintive. I never have. I prefer the approach of the Sandhivyākaraṇa Tantra: "The pleasing single vajra word is heard different by beings with different dispositions."

Astus said:
As you like. Just some extra:

'Not accompanied by the ten thousand things, what stages could there be? What do you use this for?'
(Eihei Koroku 4.301, p 281)

'These [family instructions] are simply the sitting cushions and Zen boards of the seven buddhas, and the source of the life root of the ancestors. Therefore, this is not in the realm of the four dhyanas or eight samadhis. How could it be measured in terms of the three wise or ten sacred stages? Every day just sit, dropping off body and mind. Do not be worried with a scene of laughable confusion about [comparisons between] barbarians or the civilized. Do not vainly waste a moment, but always cherish time.'
(8.1.12, p 487)

'Such examples as [Jinhua] Juzhi’s one finger, Huangbo’s sixty hits, Baizhang’s whisk, Linji’s shout, Dongshan [Shouchu]’s three pounds of sesame, and Yunmen’s dried shitstick are not caught up in the stages from living beings to Buddha, and they already transcend the boundaries of delusion and enlightenment.'
(8.2.11, p 519)

'This practice is the effort of zazen. It is customary that such practice is not abandoned, even after reaching buddhahood, so that it is [still] practiced by a buddha. Teaching and verification should be examined in the same way. This zazen was transmitted from Buddha to Buddha, directly pointed out by ancestors, and only [transmitted] by legitimate successors. Even when others hear of its name, it is not the same as the zazen of buddha ancestors. This is because the principle of zazen in other schools is to wait for enlightenment. For example, [their practice] is like having crossed over a great ocean on a raft, thinking that upon crossing the ocean one should discard the raft. The zazen of our buddha ancestors is not like this, but is simply Buddha’s practice. We could say that the situation of Buddha’s house is the oneness in which the essence, practice, and expounding are one and the same. The essence is verification of enlightenment; expounding is the teaching; and practice is cultivation. Even up to now, these have been studied together.
We should know that practice is the practice of essence and expounding; expounding is to expound the essence and practice; and the essence is the verification of expounding and practice. If practice is not the practice of expounding and is not the practice of verification of enlightenment, how can we say it is the practice of Buddha Dharma? If expounding is not the expounding of practice and is not the expounding of verification, it is difficult to call it the expounding of Buddha Dharma. If verification is not the verification of practice and is not the verification of expounding, how can we name it the verification of the Buddha Dharma? Just know that Buddha Dharma is one in the beginning, middle, and end. It is good in the beginning, middle, and end; it is nothing in the beginning, middle, and end; and it is empty in the beginning, middle, and end. This single matter never comes from the forceful activity of people, but from the beginning is the expression and activity of Dharma.'

Science is a collection of habitual and normative views.

Also, as Dogen put it in his first work after returning from China: 'Zazen is not the practice of dhyana it is just the dharma gate of ease and joy.

None of these things—self, continuum, causes, conditions, etc. Asserting any of these things as truly existent is a metaphysical assertion.

Part of the problem with Zen is all the Zen-speak. A lot of the sources are ambiguous, in part I imagine due the ambiguity of the language (especially traditional Chinese), in part because specifics were likely reserved for oral teachings, and in part due to "beyond words" issue. Accordingly, meanings diverge, and people can interpret what they want.

The question is, without kensho, if everyone is already a Buddha and all practice is an expression of Buddhanature, then what's the point? If the practice of a master is the same as the practice of some one sitting in their fantasies, falling asleep, staring off into space, etc., then it seems no different than neo-Advaitins declaring that everything is perfect as it is and that one only need to give up the concept that things are imperfect (and in some cases, then asking for large donations or sex from students). In other words, delusion is enlightenment. It just seems like a form of philosophical nihilism, or worse, roleplaying (let's pretend we're Buddhas). It is like a group of short people sitting around saying "just remove the idea of smallness." they can believe what they want, but they won't be able to dunk a basketball.

You do realize these issues have been discussed to death here for more than a decade?

The classical defense of rebirth may be found in the Pramāṇavārttika by Dharmakīrti. There really isn't anything one can add here to improve upon his arguments.

Then there is the Mahānidānasutta, which is perhaps the clearest statement by the Buddha about the process of rebirth. Also, denying rebirth constitutes wrong view, or so the Buddha has said in many places, the wrong view of annihilationism, just as the assertion of a uncompounded self constitutes eternalism.

Trying to redefine the Buddhist concept of rebirth in terms of genetic inheritance is just a massive fail on every level. You don't have to believe in rebirth, but by denying rebirth one denies the very problem Buddha set out to solve. And by rejecting rebirth, one rejects the Buddha's teachings in toto.

'Great Master Śākyamuni exactly transmitted, as the authentic tradition, this subtle method of grasping the state of truth, and the tathāgatas of the three times all attained the truth through zazen. Thus the fact that [zazen] is the authentic gate has been transmitted and received. Furthermore,
the patriarchs of the Western Heavens and the Eastern Lands all attained the truth through zazen. Therefore I am now preaching [zazen] to human beings and gods as the authentic gate.'

Maybe we can say that it is the tendency to self-grasp that causes karma/rebirth, but it's hard to ignore there is influence also going the other way. For example, when I vow to attain liberation in future lives, I am self-grasping. When I fear the results of my karma in a future life, I am also self-grasping. It is a self-perpetuating cycle.

Rebirth is the problem Buddhadharma endeavors to resolve. You are claiming that it’s solution to this problem is something other than the recognition that there is no permanent, uncompounded entity, a self, that undergoes a transition from one lifetime to another is faulty because the Buddha affirms an imputed or conventional self which does not truly exist.

There is no difference between saying I will attain buddhahood in some unspecified number of rebirths than there is to say next year I am going to California. In neither case is this an assertion of a permanent, uncompounded self. This is seeming contradiction is addressed by the Buddha in such sutras as the Vajraccheddika, where it is said, “The bodhisattva, recognizing that sentient beings do not exist, vows to lead all sentient beings to nirvana.”

“Self-grasping” means believing that there is a permanent uncompounded entity which transitions from one moment to another without change. As Matt pointed out, the very fact of cognition means a consciousness cannot be a self. Your paradox is false.

This is, as far as I know, the proven influence of the Russians on the 2016 election when it comes to Ads. According to Google's CEO around ~$4700 was spent. I fail to see how that would influence the contest between Trump and Clinton which cost around $2,65 Billions.

Because paying for adverts on Google was not the full extent of Russia’s effort and involvement.

Brunelleschi said:
Yeah no one said that. I however showed what there is proof of in regards to Russian influence when it came to ads. Obviously $4700 is nothing compared to the vast sums of money being spent.

There was no evidence found by Mueller that Trump or any of his aides coordinated election interference in 2016 with the Russian government (from: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/24/us/p ... mmary.html )

Well Sanbokyodan has no influence in Japan. Close to zero. They cannot compete with rinzai, soto or even with obaku which is the smallest zen school in Japan. Its founder Yasutani Hakuun was very influenced by Daiun  roshi of Hosshinji. But the group later on was never strong. As for quality of their kensho testimonies there are meny questions in Japan, but generally nobody takes care of their claims. I do not say that there is something wrong with them and in fact they had dozens of foreign students, but they are not very convincing anyway. I mean in Japan.

Inner experience in Japanese monasteries. That is interesting phenomenon. One has to be aware that there are no people looking for awakening. Soto or rinzai does not matter. There are young boys from family temples who must have to go through monastic training. In soto one year in rinzai 3 years. Young boys are young boys. In rinzai when they stay for 3 years have 6 sesshins a year and twice a day dokusan. They practice koan but after maybe a few months will be permitted to go on with more koans, so they pass so called 1st hosshin koan without much experience.

In zen - rinzai or soto does not matter it was kensho or satori which allowed one to go on further koans. Toaday it is not so. But it does not mean that it is all fine and ok. Some teachers point out that it is fruitless. Some say something different and give at least some reason.

If we read biographies of famous masters, all of them had kensho satori etc. even in the XX century, not only in some hazy ancient times. But it happens so rarely today.
About shikan taza I wrote already at length so there is no point to repeat it. Only one sentence - shikan taza never excluded kensho or satori. Never.

I think the author is trying to point out that there is a bit of a Pizza effect happening here. D.T. Suzuki imported William James' notion of religious experience from his book Varieties of Religious Experience to Japan; this interested the Kyoto school, Sanbokyodan, etc., this in turn caused the latter tradition to export a version of Zen to the West which is profoundly informed by Western ideas about religious experience. Varieties of Religious Experience was catalyzed by William James' experiments with Nitrous Oxide.

No, there are just coalescence of causes and conditions that have no beginning.

An individual consciousness, like seed, is a dependently-originated composite, impermanent phenomena; for example, if there is no form, there can be no eye consciousness; if there is no organ of sight, there can be no eye consciousness; if there is no consciousness, an eye consciousness cannot arise. Because three things come together: the organ of sight, a consciousness, and a form, there is eye consciousness.

The Buddha that a putative person has five aggregates in order to show that there was no self. The five aggregates are matter, sensation, perception, mental formations, and consciousness. They do not constitute a self together, there is no self in one of them individually, and there is no self apart from them. The five aggregates constantly arise together based on cause and condition. Though nothing is transferred from this life to the next, there is nevertheless serial continuity of a given psycho-physical continuum.

I agree with the gist of what you're saying. But faith, even one that is not connected to any verifiable truth is not condemned per se. It's the failure to safeguard truth that is the problem. It's when one says on faith, only this is true, all else false, that faith
of any degree becomess a problem. That is the disposition of a closed mind. Proceeding on our best information, lacking actual knowledge, is what most of us do most of the time. This is  basically the definition of a deluded being who has not overcome delusion... as long as delusion remains, by definition there are things we don't know and don't even know we don't know. So long as we are open to new information, we keep the path to awakening open. The moment we think we know all there is to know, no matter how much we know, we've closed the path to awakening.

The Buddha didn't preclude the path of prasada. It might not be a direct path, but even such naive faith is accepted for those who cannot manage more. We have a responsibility for our one eyed kin.

Yes, I would say that if you don't have a mind that can see nuances, or is not capable of holding on to two seemingly contradictory views, you might be well advised to concentrate on practice and not dip your toe into scholarship. If you are an experienced practitioner whose primary focus is still practice, then scholarship can be quite useful, for the reasons mentioned above.

Queequeg said:
Case by case. There's not a lot of nuance once one starts poking around in the origins of the Mahayana and Vajrayana pantheon. The faithful versions and the academic versions often say very different things that no amount of nuance is going to resolve. Avoiding specifics, when a deity is a central focus in a tradition, with a back story that puts it squarely in the Buddhadharma tradition, and then you look at academic studies that show this was the totem deity of some tribe or caste in the distant past, in a religious system that had nothing to do with Buddhism... how do you then interpret a teacher's claims that they had a spiritual communion with this deity and received sacred instructions? To keep it up is going to require some serious fudging of details or putting up firewalls in the mind.

I'm fully open to accepting I'm one of those people who lack the intellectual finesse to reconcile divergent claims over the same intellectual geography.

Malcolm wrote:
The Indian mind was a lot more flexible about such issues. This is why one sees tropes shared with the Ramayāna that show up recontextualized in a Buddhist context, for example, to explain the origins of the Buddhist protectress, Śṛīdevi Mahākālī.  Śṛīdevi is known originally named Sita Śankhapāla. She elopes with Dasagriva aka Ravanna, having been tricked into it by Dasagriva's sister, Remati. Umadevi (the worldly manifestation of the protectress Ekajati), her mother disowns her, and Sita Śankhapāla takes on the form of a rakṣasī as a result, etc., eventually to be tamed by the Brahmin Vararuci. Since as far as I am concerned this is a myth and the myth of Sita's abduction by Ravanna have equal standing as a myth, I don't worry about it too much. In Tibet, different schools have different accounts of the taming of Rudra, all based on Indian sources, they are often in conflict about details, and no one blinks an eyelash. Indeed, in the same school different tantric cycles will have differing explanations of the taming of Rudra, and again, no one bats an eyelash. The validity of the practice has more to do with whether one can manifest siddhis from it, rather than whether or not it fits some neurotic compulsion to reconcile different narratives. For example, in Shingon, it is maintained that the tantras were first revealed by Vajrasattva in an iron towed in South India. In Tibet, in the Sarma schools, it is generally maintained that the tantras were also revealed in South India by a king who travelled to Oddiyāna and received them a siddha yoginī who was descendent from Nāgas. In Nyingma, it is generally held they were first revealed by a king in Zahor named Dza. While there is a bit of bickering back and forth between the Nyingmas and the Sarma schools over the accuracy of the interpretation of the King Dza account, not one really cares that much. Then, of course, the Bonpos claim they are the source of everything, but no one pays them much mind either. When Buddhists resort to the services of Bonpo Lamas it is because the latter have siddhi, not because Buddhists accept Bonpo history. But talk of siddhis will get you shut down pretty fast in the Academy.

What do you think of the term "mantrayana?" I personally find it more precise than "Vajrayana" and wish it had more widespread use.

Malcolm wrote:
In the Indian Buddhist tantras preserved in the Kengyur, there are 93 mentions of vajrayāna; 2 mentions of guhyamantrayāna; and 21 mentions of mantrayāna.

In the Indian commentarial literature preserved in the Tengyur, there are 461 mentions of vajrayāna; 75 for guhyamantrayāna; and 191 for mantrayāna, but many times, mantrayāna and guhyamantrayāna are quite close to each other in proximity, meaning that the former is often a contraction of the latter.

I would say, that since the Vajramāla commentary and other texts equate Vajrayāna and Mantrayāna, Vajrayāna is clearly the more widespread and widely used term in Indian sources, and therefore, mere force of usage in Indian literature favors the use of the term Vajrayāna as an overall name for this Buddhist textual movement.

In Tibetan sources one often see "Secret Mantra Vajrayāna" (gsang sngags rdo rje'i theg pa).

To add to this, the earlier tantras transmitted to Japan are quite few in number, compared with the very large amount of tantras transmitted to Tibet at exactly the same time (800 CE). The term "vajrayāna" was already widely used in India by this time even for so-called "lower tantras" like the Subāhuparipṛcchā Tantra, or "yoga tantras" like the Vajraśikhara tantra, in which is found the term "vajrayāna," though not in the incomplete version translated by Amoghasiddhi.

'Dogen taught his religion through the language and lore of Chinese Ch'an; yet in many ways the structure of his religion reflects familiar patterns in the soteriological strategies of Japanese writers like Shinran and Nichiren. This is hardly surprising, since many of the same issues that determined the rules of Ch'an discourse in China - the theory of the supreme, Buddha vehicle and the perfect, sudden practice appropriate to it - had long been at work in the dominant Tendai system in Japan, the system that initially educated Dogen, Shinran, Nichiren, and other leaders of the reformation. Despite their obvious differences, in very broad terms, the ideologies of all three of these famous religious thinkers can be seen as an attempt to define the true practice of the Tendai Buddha vehicle - a sudden practice to be based solely on the absolute truth of Buddhahood itself, not on the upaya of the relative teachings and gradual practices.'

Those who have faith in the buddha-way must believe that one (the self) is within the Way from the beginning; that you are free from delusive desires, upside-down ways of seeing things, excesses or deficiencies, and mistakes. Arousing this kind of faith, clarifying the Way and practicing the Way comprise the foundation of learning the Way. We do this by sitting and cutting off the root of the discriminating mind; by turning away from the path of intellectual understanding. This is a skillful way to lead beginners. Next, drop off body and mind, and throw away both delusion and enlightenment. This is the second stage. Truly it is most difficult to find a person who believes that his self is within the buddha-way. Only if you believe that you are really inside the Way, will you naturally clarify the scenery of the Great Way and understand the origin of delusion and enlightenment. Try to sit cutting off the root of discriminating mind. Eight or nine out of ten will be able to immediately see the Way.'

Astus said:
The main point is that if shikantaza is practice-realisation, then there is no point of working towards a realisation apart from it, there is no satori later. A comparison of the two approaches from Shohaku Okumura:

'Uchiyama Roshi emphasizes that the zazen practice transmitted from Dogen Zenji to Sawaki Roshi differs from D. T. Suzuki’s Zen. For example, Dogen Zenji described the oneness of a practitioner and other people and objects, using the example of a cook and his work with colleagues, ingredients, firewood, and water, as well as those who eat the food. In “Tenzokyokun,” or “Instructions for the Cook,” in Dogen’s Pure Standards for the Zen Community, he wrote, “All day and all night, things come to mind and the mind attends to them; at one with them all, diligently carry on the Way.” Here there’s no mysterious satori, or becoming conscious of the Unconscious. There’s only sincere, wholehearted practice in ordinary activities.'
(Zazen Is the Stability of One’s Whole Life, in Homeless Kodo)

And from Kodo Sawaki:

'Nine hundred years ago there was a Zen system in which there were gradations of satori—three hundred and some tens of cases. Finally completing them all you would perfect a great satori. That system was contrasted with what was referred to as mokusho Zen [silent illumination]. It was also labeled eko and hensho. The other teaching [which uses koans] was called kanna Zen.
Dogen Zenji’s is a religion of practice. Dogen goes so far as to say there is no benefit in recitation with the mouth. In the Bendowa, Dogen wrote: “Continuously uttering sounds is like a frog crying in the night in a spring rice paddy and is ultimately worthless.” 
In the Butsuyuikyogyo, too, [the Buddha] warns against useless talk... Satori is not something that is uncovered by the mind. Practice is enlightenment.
Again in the Bendowa, “A beginner’s wholehearted practice of the Way is the totality of the original enlightenment.” And in Zanmai O Zanmai [The King of Samadhi], “The posture for shikantaza is the most important meaning in Buddhist teaching.”'

We are at a crisis point in the history of our species, and if we do not get our shit together democratically now, it is inevitable that draconian measures will be needed later to save our species, if it is worth saving at all.

fantasizing about sex or murdering your enemies, falling asleep - all those are not alaya state, they are just common thoughts. so it has nothing to do with arriving at alaya in zazen.. if anyone will adopt such opinion about alaya will be in serious trouble, and will mistake all kinds of experience in zazen... is is not my opinion, but one may find description of the alaya state of zazen in writtings of some masters...

The consequence of this is that one is only realized during shikantaza. How does this escape the equipoise/post-equipoise division? And if there is a division between equipoise/post-equipoise, this means that there are stages.

All largely irrelevant to the question of whether there was a bodhisattvayana preceding Gautama.  That’s four times I’ve asked and you haven’t responded, so I’ll assume you don’t have any evidence for this.

We do know, and it’s very well documented, that there were sramana movements before, during and after his life.  But to claim that a bodhisattvayana existed, you need more than just beliefs in reincarnation and spiritual practices.

Aemilius said:
I have said before that there are no academic proofs for this claim or view, but there are spiritual proofs, and these are not accepted by the academic world view. I.e. the Five eyes and the Six supernormal powers, these have been accepted as a basis of knowledge in the Dharma for 2500 years. Next  arises the question whose extraordinary perceptions will be accepted ? I believe that You you have been a member in a modern Buddhist movement, so that you would know that there still is knowledge passing around that comes from supranormal perceptions. Different traditions accept  different authorities, who are then relied on and quoted in these matters.

The supranormal perceptions can be, and quite often are, in opposition to the prevailing academic views. In this case all we can do, in the academic field, is to say that it is possible that the Mahayana has existed as an oral tradition, long before the writing down of the Mahayana sutras.

There is also a spiritual necessity for the existence of the Mahayana. You would know this only when you are quite advanced on the spiritual path, so this also doesn't count as an academic proof. Which is unfortunate.

I hope this discussion has not been in vain.

This is why he is the most important Mahāyāna figure, apart from the Buddha in Mahāyāna sūtras. Of course there were Mahāyāna sūtras prior to Nāgārjuna, but he was the first person to articulate a polemical defense of Mahāyāna and the first historical person (by western criteria) to give Mahāyāna a serious intellectual platform.

Here are some "political passages" from the Tao De Ching:
61. Submission

A nation is like a hierarchy, a marketplace, and a maiden.
A maiden wins her husband by submitting to his advances;
Submission is a means of union.

So when a large country submits to a small country
It will adopt the small country;
When a small country submits to a large country
It will be adopted by the large country;
The one submits and adopts;
The other submits and is adopted.

It is in the interest of a large country to unite and gain service,
And in the interest of a small country to unite and gain patronage;
If both would serve their interests,
Both must submit.
68. Compassion

Compassion is the finest weapon and best defence.
If you would establish harmony,
Compassion must surround you like a fortress.

Therefore,
A good soldier does not inspire fear;
A good fighter does not display aggression;
A good conqueror does not engage in battle;
A good leader does not exercise authority.

This is the value of unimportance;
This is how to win the cooperation of others;
This to how to build the same harmony that is in nature.
It really is a Philosophy for all levels of society, but written by someone observing from the very top of the so called "ladder."

About Yeshe you said that "he wants to have nothing to do with the DC", and you  asked me if I have attended the meeting during which the IDG answered people's questions. I have not attended the meeting, I thought it would be a waste of time, but of course, I read the documents they provided, and one of the answers to one of the questions about Transmissions / Lungs, more specifically: "Will Yeshi give direct transmission?" Was: "Yeshi announced that he would give direct transmission in Merigar West for people seriously interested in the teaching of Chogyal Namkhai Norbu in Easter 2020. Then the event was canceled due to the Covid pandemic. Yeshi said in the two meetings in August that he intends to make it possible to access the texts and teaching of Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, by meeting people seriously interested in the Teaching of the Master, when circumstances make it possible."

I am still trying to find the coherence between saying that Yeshe don't want to have nothing to do with the Dzogchen Community, and the Dzogchen Community people keep saying things like this not only in informal conversations, but in their Annual General Meeting. Finally, about Yeshe's reasons behind his conflict with the Dzogchen Community I do think that we should not ignore it. It would be foolish, as sooner or later some stuff will show up.

laowhining said:
The lack of coherence is due to differences in understanding of what was said during the meeting. I attended the meeting and my understanding of what Khyentse Yeshi said does not correspond entirely to the collection of points sent out some days after the meeting that seems to have proliferated online. I'm not saying one is wrong or right, just that what is circulating online is mostly speculation.

I don't think this speculation is particularly fruitful, at least not what I see online; it seems more like gossip than anything else. Maybe it's helpful if we reflect on how we, as a Community, have interacted with Rinpoche and Yeshi and the rest of the family in a way that could create this kind of tension, but I think it's necessary to know more about what happened than most of us do if we want to make these conversations anything more than speculation and useless hand-wringing about "the future of the teachings."

If you are claiming that the term "the middle way" is merely a convention, thats fine. The words "middle way" have a function. But those words are not the inexpressible middle way taught by the Buddha in the sutras I mentioned.

If something has a function, it is compounded, and impermanent. There are no permanent, functional phenomena. Buddhanature is not a functional phenomena, if it were, it would be compounded.

Also the examples you offer also talk about some sort of eternal soul, which is definitely not the Bodhisattvayana.

You must understand that there is no continual tradition reaching us from the time of Pythagoras, subtle things are always subtle, it is true of any tradition that says "reincarnation" or "consciousness" etc.. that the mind can and will reify them to be self-existing eternal entities. It is in the nature of language.

Who says this? One thing is what the various scholars publish in papers, another thing is what they say in lectures, and the third is what they say in private conversations. I think it is clearly evident from the things that exist, and that I referred to. You must be able to think for yourself also. I really can't say that it is my own theory that the Indo-Aryan peoples had a world view, and had spiritual traditions, before they migrated to different parts of the world. This has been said many times, emphasizing different things and diffrent ideas, depending on the person.

Thor Heyerdahl had the idea that Odin was a historical person, who lived somewhere in the area around the Black sea. I have a similar kind of view, namely that Odin is the same parson as the Oddiyan guru or Padmasambhava, and that he lived in Georgia, which is the original Urgyen (Ge-orgyen) i.e. the Oddiyan country. Guru of Orgyen was assimilated into Christianity as Saint George, the Patron Saint of Georgia.
Heyerdahl studied his ideas concerning Odin for many years.

Asko Parpola is a well  known researcher in this area, his emphasis is on the hindu ideas:
"Books
1994: Deciphering the Indus Script, Cambridge University Press,
2015: The Roots of Hinduism: The Early Aryans and the Indus Civilization, Oxford University Press,
Selected articles
1988: The coming of the Aryans to Iran and India and the cultural and ethnic identity of the Dāsas, Studia Orientalia, Vol. 64, pp. 195–302. The Finnish Oriental Society.
2008: Is the Indus script indeed not a writing system? In: Airāvati: Felicitation volume in honour of Iravatham Mahadevan: 111–31. VARALAARU.COM, Chennai.

Reception
Parpola's long journal article The Coming of the Aryans is widely cited by historians and scholars of Indo-European Studies. Colin Renfrew, who has reviewed the article, called it a "richly annotated and well-illustrated essay," which brings together a number of different lines of arguments, including literary and archaeological. It contains rich and interesting insights into a variety of topics, including the "amalgamation of the Aryan and Dasa religions," and the Nuristani language.
Awards
Asko Parpola received the Kalaignar M. Karunanidhi Classical Tamil Award for 2009 on June 23, 2010 at the World Classical Tamil Conference at Coimbatore. In 2015, he was awarded India's Presidential Award of Certificate of Honour in Sanskrit. He is an honorary member of the American Oriental Society."

In the early (, middle or late) 1900's the issue was a dangerously political one, and thus the early translators like Rhys-Davids or Edward Conze didn't say anything about the possible connection of Dharma to the Indo-Aryan culture. Earlier Max Muller had said something about, for example in his book: F. Max Müller (1888) Biographies of Words and the Home of the Aryas. Kessinger Publishing reprint, 2004.

It is not my assertion (sorry for me being poor in my expression). Lower tantras (i.e. assertion is that they are superior then sutra; same way comparing Zhiyi's view on Madhyamaka from five periods) lead up to the path of seeing, not beyond. From that point to Buddhahood, one is not going to attain Buddhahood faster unless anuttaryoga is used. So, it is about time (i.e. quicker or longer).

My point is simple: Madhyamaka needs no improvement. It’s the highest of the four tenet systems, and attempts to improve upon it merely obscure its austere elegance.
I also fully agree on this point. But it is nice in theory only. What they do practice is more important than what they do say. For practically speaking, everyone (Tsongkhapa, Longchenpa, Dolpopa, Zhiyi, Nichiren, etc.) has their own way. Everyone had built something over it.

With respect to the first two masters you mention, they did not build anything over Madhyamaka, they are simply Vajrayana practitioners; with the respect to the third, his Madhyamaka is distorted; with respect to fourth, it seems he used Madhyamaka as a departure and indeed constructed a novel system, and the fifth follows the fourth.

Malcolm wrote:
Ārya-dharmasaṃgīti-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:


Child of a good family, so called "suchness, suchness" is a term designating emptiness. The empty neither arise nor cease.


As for QQ:

Ārya-aṣṭādaśasāhasrikā-prajñāpāramitā-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

If one is diligent in the emptiness of ignorance, one is called diligent. If one is diligent in the emptiness of ignorance, formations, consciousness, name, form, six sense bases, contact, sensation, craving, addiction, becoming, birth, aging, and death, one is called "diligent." If one is diligent in the emptiness of all dharmas, one is called "diligent." If one is diligent in the emptiness of compounded and uncompounded phenomena, one is called "diligent."

The Sūtra of Great Liberation (no Sanskrit title, so probably translated from Chinese):

That being the case, child of a good family, the Buddha is the the dharma, the dharma is the sangha. The sangha is uncompounded. The uncompounded is emptiness. The emptiness of the uncompounded, the emptiness of the compounded, the internal emptiness, and external emptiness, the emptiness of the large, and the emptiness of the small are alike as emptiness, and not otherwise.

As for the middle way, the so-called middle way is inexpressible as we see in such sūtras as the Ārya-kāśyapa-parivarta-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

Kāśyapa, if it is asked how one undertakes the dharma according to the approach of a bodhisattva, it is as follows, true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way. 

Kāśyapa, If it is asked what is true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way, Kāśyapa, the true discernment into the absence of identity, true discernment into the absence of a sentient being, the absence of a creature, the absence of a life, the absence of a person, the absence of an individual, the absence of a human, the absence of a man. Kāśyapa, this is called "true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way."

Kāśyapa, furthermore, the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way is not discerning permanence nor discerning impermanence in matter. Kāśyapa, likewise, it is not discerning permanence nor discerning impermanence in sensations, perceptions, formations, and consciousness. Kāśyapa, this is called "orrect discernment into the dharmas of the middle way."

 Kāśyapa, further, the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way is is not discerning permanence nor discerning impermanence in the element of earth, and likewise, is not discerning permanence nor discerning impermanence in the element of water, the element of fire, the element of air, the element of space, or the element of consciousness. Kāśyapa, this is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way."

Kāśyapa, further, the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way is not discerning permanence nor discerning impermanence in the eye sense base, and likewise, not discerning permanence nor discerning impermanence in the ear, nose, tongue, tactile, and mental sense bases.  Kāśyapa, this is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way."

Kāśyapa, "permanence" is one extreme, "impermanence" is the second extreme. Whatever is between those two extremes cannot be investigated, demonstrated, cannot be a support, cannot appear, cannot be made known, and cannot abide. Kāśyapa, this is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way." 

Kāśyapa, "self" is one extreme, "nonself" is the second extreme. Whatever is between those two extremes cannot be investigated, demonstrated, cannot be a support, cannot appear, cannot be made known, and cannot abide. Kāśyapa, this is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way." 

Kāśyapa, "correct thought" is one extreme, "incorrect thought" is the second extreme. Absence of thought, absence of intention, absence of mind, and absence of consciousness, Kāśyapa, this is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way." 

All dharmas of virtue and nonvirtue, mundane and transcendent, with sin and without sin, contaminated and uncontaminated, compounded and uncompounded are just like that. 

Kāśyapa, "afflicted" is one extreme, "purified" is the second extreme. Whatever is  nonacceptance, nonexpression, or nonspeaking of those two extremes,  Kāśyapa, this is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way." 

Kāśyapa, "existence" is one extreme, "nonexistence" is the second extreme. Whatever is between those two extremes cannot be investigated, demonstrated, cannot be a support, cannot appear, cannot be made known, and cannot abide. Kāśyapa, this is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way." 

Kāśyapa, "samsara" is one extreme, "nirvana" is the second extreme. Whatever is between those two extremes cannot be investigated, demonstrated, cannot be a support, cannot appear, cannot be made known, and cannot abide. Kāśyapa, this is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way." 

Kāśyapa, I have explained to you, "Through the condition of ignorance arise formations; through the condition of formations, consciousness; through the condition of consciousness, name-and-form; through the condition of name-and-form, six sense bases; through the condition of six-sense bases, contact; through the condition of contact, sensation; through the condition of sensation, craving; through the condition of craving, addiction; through the condition of addiction, becoming; through the condition of becoming, birth, through the condition of birth, aging-and-death, misery, lamentation, suffering, unhappiness, and the arising of disturbance. As such only a great mass of suffering arises. 

Because ignorance ceases, formations cease; because formations cease, consciousness ceases; because consciousness ceases, name-and-form ceases; because name-and-form ceases, the six sense bases cease; because the six sense bases cease, contact ceases; because contact ceases, sensation ceases; because sensation ceases, craving ceases; because craving ceases, addiction ceases; because addiction ceases, becoming ceases; because becoming ceases, birth ceases; because birth ceases, aging-and-death, misery, lamentation, unhappiness, and disturbance cease. As such, this whole mass of suffering ceases." 

Kāśyapa, knowledge and ignorance, those are not two, but are inseparable as two aspects.  Kāśyapa, knowledge of this is called the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way. 

Likewise, formations and the cessation of formations; consciousness and the cessation of consciousness; name-and-form and the cessation of name-and-form; six sense bases and the cessation of six sense bases; sensation and the cessation of sensation; craving and the cessation of craving; addiction and and the cessation of addiction; becoming and the cessation of becoming; birth and the cessation of birth; aging-and-death and the cessation of aging-and-death, those are not two, but are inseparable as two aspects. Knowledge of this is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way." 

Kāśyapa, moreover, the true discernment into dharmas of the middle way is not making dharmas empty with emptiness, dharmas themselves are empty; it is not making dharmas without characteristics with the absence of characteristics; dharmas themselves lack characteristics; it is not making dharmas free of aspiration through aspirationlessness, dharmas themselves are without aspiration; it is not making dharmas unfabricated through nonfabrication, dharmas themselves are not fabricated; it is not making dharma not arise through nonarising, dharmas themselves do not arise; it is not making dharmas unproduced through nonproduction, dharmas themselves are unproduced; it is not making dharmas lack inherent existence through lacking inherent existence, dharmas themselves lack inherent existence. And such discernment, Kāśyapa, is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way."

And the Mahāparinirvana sūtra:

Bodhisattvas teach the middle way. If it is asked why, though all dharmas do not exist, it is also explained they do not not exist, and are not ascertained to be the same. Why? Consciousness arises by means of the condition of eye, form, light, mental factors, and the intellect. Also it is definite that consciousness does not exist in the eye, the form, the light, the mental factor, nor the the intellect, nor in between. It does not exist, it does not not exist, but because it arises from being dependently produced it is said "to exist." Because it has no inherent existence, it is said "not to exist." Therefore, the Tathāgata has said that though all dharmas do not exist neither do they not exist.

and the Ārya-mahāyānopadeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

Abandoning all views is entering into the middle way, seeing all dharmas as equal.

But one does not need to propose a third truth to understand this.

Arya-pratyutpanne buddha-saṃmukhāvasthita-samādhi-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

Bhadrapāla, in that way, any son or daughter of a good family who wishes for perfect full awakening and any son or daughter of a good family who wishes for personal awakening, or any son or daughter of a good family who wishes for arhatship, they must investigate those dharmas. After they investigate those dharmas in that way, dharmas should not be investigated as pacified, nor should they be investigated as not pacified. Why Bhadrapāla? Because nothing is destroyed and nothing is born. If one conceives "all dharmas are pacified" in dharmas that are totally unestablished, this is one extreme. If one conceives "all dharmas are not pacified", this is the second extreme. 

Bhadrapāla, not perceiving, not conceiving, not establishing, not thinking about, and not engaging these two extremes—pacified and unpacified—is the middle way through the explanation of the mundane relative in a manner of enumeration, however, in the ultimate, the extremes or the middle are not perceived. Why Bhadrapāla? As such all phenomena are like space, equal with nirvana. They cannot be annihilated, cannot be destroyed, are not permanent, and do not exist forever. They do not abide in a region, they do not abide in a direction, they are without characteristics, and cannot be enumerated. Since they cannot even be approached by the learned through enumeration nor perceived, all phenomena are called "non-enumerable."

To use ziporyn's terminology, local coherence (conventions/dharma's) / global incoherence (emptiness). A is A in contrast to Not A; but Not A is an arbitrary distinction (Buddha makes distinctions in order to teach - upaya); but if A is intelligible only contrasted with Not A, Not A is actually an integral aspect of A. Taken to it's end, everything turns out to be an aspect of A, which makes A incoherent when everything is taken into account. Without distinctions, A can't be discerned. A is the sum of everything Not A. Careful examination of A reveals only Not A.

That last analysis is Madhyamaka. The rest of the argument is a sort of reverse analysis. This is Zhiyi's threefold contemplation. The argument doesn't just devolve to emptiness as some interpretations of Madhyamaka argue. It is reversible. Emptiness after all is emptiness of a compound thing. There's no emptiness without a compounded thing. This fluid identity between compounded things and emptiness is called the middle. Nagarjuna says just this in 24:18.

Zhiyi also points out that this fluid identity is the Buddha function to point this out. We don't see it without the Buddha pointing this out. We are without buddha, naively convinced of the soldity of compounded dharmas. The fact that they are compounded though is the reality of buddha. Or in other words, middle way/buddha nature.

There is something else going on here than mere Madhyamaka.

As you note the Shingon-Risshu was established based self-ordination verified by miraculous signs.

There is freedom of religion in Japan; anyone can shave their head, order some robes online, and call themselves a monk.

Apart from that, there are also "ordination mills" that promise to make you a prelate in a few months, usually for several thousand USD. They often have titles that resemble the kanji for traditional priest/monk (僧侶) but are subtly, cleverly different. They might have a name that resembles one of the thirteen traditional schools, but call themselves a "協会" (church) instead of a "sect" (宗). There are other tricks out there too.

There are also other "short cuts" into the traditional schools, but they are generally ment for children or relatives of traditional priests and may be hard for a layperson to make use of.

It also depends on the sect. Some are more stringent about training requirements than others.

But despite the fact that the most "orthodox" route involves a 4-year university and time training at a temple under a priest, the ordinarion situation in Japan can be described as "eclectic." I personally know of one "self ordained" Jodo Shinshu monk who has a stable position at a respected medium-sized temple staffed by fellow monks who followed the more orthodox route, and he seems to be accepted by the institution as legitimate. I am not sure how he pulled that off.

So this is just something I have been interested in for a while. Does anyone know if there are any schools of Buddhism that do not require a four year degree for ordination? It seems like most Japanese schools do, Jodo Shinshu definitely does, and in Jodo Shu the training for monks is equivalent to a four year degree. Are there any schools that do all of the training for becoming a monk or priest within the temple? Are there any Buddhist varieties  that require a long training session but it is not related to western style four year education? If anyone could explain how ordination works in their particular school it would be very interesting to hear.

Tibet was an aristocratic autocracy where the nobility could injure the common folk with absolute impunity. There was no justice system, so while a thief might lose a hand or an eye, aristocrats just became more and more wealthy. The amount of child abuse in Tibetan monasteries was staggering, the amount of rape in Tibetan culture was likewise staggering. Murder was very common. Cruelty to animals was commonplace. Literacy was no more than 15 percent of the population. Now, was Tibet an incredible civilization with many redeeming qualities as well? Certainly, but all we see is the literary culture of Tibet.

The fourfold negation is not a formulation of three truths. It is a step-by-step negation of erroneous propositions about things. It is not in fact a postulate; Nagarjuna has no postulates. His dialectic is strictly negative. For Nagarjuna, there are only veridical perceptions, or false perceptions. There are no perceptions that are simultaneously true and false.

And actually, the area where I live was not claimed by any tribe. All the tribes lived down near the Connecticut River, not up in the hills. It was territory where hostile tribes would fight each other, kind a no mans lands between the Mohawks of the Hudson River valley in New York and Nonotuck Tribes.

So I came up with a specific suggestion which I then tried to sell online.  If each Catholic donated $1 per year that would raise a billion dollars a year to bring further attention to the subject of nuclear weapons, as seen from the Catholic perspective.  Absolutely no interest, none whatsoever.

This naturally raises the question, do Catholics believe the Pope when he says nuclear weapons are an important threat?  Does the Pope even believe that?  Or is it just pleasing moral theory which is fun to say?

Bodhiquest said:
There's nothing much that would allow us to conclusively say that certain ideas and teachings were never given by the Buddha and were simply developed later by "philosophers" and the like.

Astus said:
That's not necessarily so. For instance, the concept of alayavijnana is a later development as we can see in the Mahayanasamgraha how Asanga has to explain himself for proposing its existence, and what scriptural sources he can present (abhidharma works and the Samdhinirmocana Sutra), while 5 centuries later Jinamitra quotes from several Mahayana sutras (see 'The Ālaya-Consciousness in Yogācāra Treatises' in the Introduction of 'A Compendium of the Mahayana' by Brunnholzl, vol 1). Similarly, where one finds the mention of ideas that are not found in the Agamas but only in abhidharma texts, unless we attribute such abhidharma treatises to the Buddha, the sutras using such concepts are necessarily later than the Agamas.

Malcolm wrote:
The answer is that there is an oral transmission for the Tibetan canon. Questions of the source of the Mahayana are adequately answered in traditional accounts. Text critical scholarship is fine, but it has nothing to do with the aim of Mahayana.

Taking what is not given, I.e stealing, is strictly defined in Buddhism as depriving another of something they believe they possess. Our notion that we stole land from Natives is rather modern, and involves concepts of property we introduced. Thus, I am not sure your shifting of goal posts is applicable.

NatureTalk said:
Ok, point taken, but perhaps we are getting a bit too clever?

It's true that the Indian concept of land ownership was quite different than the European concept.  Nonetheless, the Indians lived off a particular area of land, and Europeans kicked them off and took over that area.  To be fair, the Indians often did the same thing amongst themselves.

This thread is in part an exploration of the tribal nature of ideologies (not just Buddhism).  We can observe how at the moment that the thought experiment became inconvenient we jumped from a seemingly universal peaceful agreement to a pattern of dodge and weave rationalizations, ie. a defense of the tribal territory.  The exact same thing happened when I posed these questions on a Catholic forum.

I don't see this as an exclusive property of Buddhism or any other religion, but instead a universal property of all ideologies (as best I can tell).  We attach ourselves to some collection of thoughts, and when that collection of thoughts is perceived to be under threat we circle the wagons and start moving towards conflict.

Typically we try to solve this by jumping from one ideology to another.  If we see the Christians in conflict with each other, we turn up our noses and try some other religion.  But the pattern of conflict seems to follow us where ever we go.   What can we learn from that?

The thread might also be seen as an exploration of the limits of ideology.   Europe was dominated by Christianity to a degree unimaginable to us today for 1,000 years before the European discovery of North America.   1,000 years.  And yet that didn't stop there from being a very wide spread largely uncontested nearly universal consensus for genocide once some inconvenient people got in the way.

Ok, there's been some improvement along the way.  We aren't that in to genocide now, but we're still content to sit on the stolen property without much concern.  We don't even think of it as stolen property.

And let's not pick on religion here.  Science culture philosophy claims we should accumulate new knowledge as fast as we possibly can, even though that process has aimed thousands of massive hydrogen bombs down our throats.  We see the threat, and are largely bored by it.

Is morality a myth?  Ok, too sweeping a question. But not that unreasonable.

Along a similar line, while I certainly believe that the creation of America involved stealing from (and frankly near genocide of) Native Americans, and others, as far as land goes, there's no way to give it back now.

The only reasonable approach under our current circumstances is to advocate for greater autonomy and/or relief for tribes, etc. For instance, advocating for land and water rights It's not possible to "give it back" altogether. Individuals could leave in protest, but this is impractical for a whole host of reasons, and would really just be performative anyway.

So yeah, make more coherent comparisons.

Malcolm wrote:
One thing that often goes unrecognized when the idea that Europeans “stole” land from Indians is, as I mention above, the fact that European and Native concepts of “property” were completely unintelligible to each other. It is certainly the case that Europeans dispossessed, displaced, and often exterminated Native people, but the history of this is far more complicated than a simple reductionist trope. It’s also somewhat off topic for a discussion of Buddhist ethical theory,

Buddhist ethical theory is about personal conduct, and is not equipped or even intended to address issues such such large-scale, generational social justice issues. This is not to say that a Buddhist should not adress them, but there is virtually no guidance here from the Buddha.

In this respect Western discourse on ethics is more apt.

If he has been deemed to have failed in this, he can be removed by the board, for example, when Steve Jobs was removed from Apple.

I didn't mean to imply that this was covered by section 230. What I was trying to put across is that despite 230, an irresponsible director could be removed by their board.

Nichiren goes through these incredibly dissonant comparisons to say offhandedly in a really small statement towards the end of opening of the eyes, to paraphrase, now that you have considered these things yourself as if to say now that you have abolished the dissonance between these teachings for yourself.

As for the Section 230 issue: For example, it recently came to my attention that corporate directors have limits on what they can say because of fiduciary liability. I had never considered this before because I am not a business person, etc. Companies like Amazon, Facebook, etc., face such liabilities as well, and guys like Bezos, etc. face being unseated if their boards decide they have not lived up to their fiduciary obligations. Thus, they act when pushed, as in the recent deplatforming of Parler, and Twitter bans on Trump, etc. I would not be at all surprised, for example, that the final decision to ban Trump was a result of several years of board angst about stock prices, etc., pro and con., was made easy when Trump plotted a coup to overthrow the US Government, i.e., your and my vote. Had Trump won, there is no way he and White ISIS would have been deplatformed, banned, etc.

There may be those on the forum who could offer a more definitive and informed explanation. As I understand, Shingon ordination even now is not just symbolic. Maybe if we are talking about a bhiksu ordination, non-Japanese might conclude Shingon ordination is merely symbolic. But becoming a Shingon ordinand is not just a facile formality. It requires one to enter into a student-master relationship with a teacher and to undergo training. I don't know the exact course on Koya-san, but it takes considerable time and effort. And that's the similar for other sects of Japanese Buddhism.

That is a good point. But you're assuming a certain set of assumptions about the state of the monastic institutions and monastics in Japan in the Heian period. Are you depending on other sources for this position? Are you arguing that the formality of ordination doesn't qualify as the continuation of vinaya ordination?

Malcolm wrote:
An ordination rite depends on the rite being carried out correctly, by a sthavira who has been a monk for ten years, and a quorum of other senior monks. It is a complicated procedure, where the vows are gone through in blocks, and the aspirant accepting them. If it is not carried out correctly, it isn't valid.

In addition, in no school does one become a fully ordained bikṣu in one day, other than the merit ordinations most Thai men undergo. Generally, one is ordained a śrāmana, a novice, then later, a bhikṣu, after living as novice under the direction of preceptor for some years.

"...people running around an ordination platform." I think this not merely hyperbole.

This set the stage for the eventual decline of bhikṣu ordination and the Ritsu school, so that within 500 years, there were no bhikṣus left in Japan.

Monks, including those in the Tendai order continued to observe much of the Vinaya, including celibacy, for centuries, up to the time that Oda Nobunaga burned the whole mountain down. The Bodhisattva Precepts did not supplant vinaya. Generally, they were in addition.

What are you talking about? Saicho cancelled bhikṣu ordination, calling for it to be replaced by a ten precept Mahāyāna ordination:

Queequeg said:
The Hossō school was in charge of the Bureau of Monks at that time, and so in a position to block Saichō's writings from reaching the court. In frustration, the normally reticent and humble Saichō became more extreme in his positions, until finally the noise reached the court in spite of the Bureau's attempts to cut him off. From an initial position advocating some minor changes in the ordination process, Saichō came to request that Mt. Hiei be declared a solely Mahāyāna temple exempt from having to use the Hīnayāna ordination precepts of the Ritsu.or Vinaya school. He proposed that, instead, they take their ordination from a Mahāyāna scripture, the Fan wang ching, or ‘Sūtra of Brahma's Net’. These precepts are referred to as the Bodhisattva precepts, and had always functioned as a complement to the traditional monastic precepts; they were never designed to replace them. Thus, the establishment found Saichō's position entirely inadmissible.

Title: Eisen on Free Speech and what the GOP gets wrong

Unknown said:
[S]ome Republicans have retreated to makeshift claims that Trump cannot be impeached because his speech at the rally was somehow protected by the First Amendment. As the late Justice Antonin Scalia might say, that is pure applesauce. It fails on every level.

To start, it turns the First Amendment upside down: the Free Speech Clause exists to protect private citizens from the government, not to protect government officials from accountability for their own abusive statements. The Supreme Court has held that government officials and public employees enjoy substantially reduced First Amendment protection for speech relating to the performance of their official duties. As the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility.

More important, any “free speech” defense gets the Impeachment Clause wrong. The articles of impeachment against Presidents Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon, Bill Clinton, and Trump (from just a year ago) all arose, in part, from statements they had made. Yet in none of these cases did anyone assert that the First Amendment barred impeachment. That is unsurprising. Impeachment does not inflict punishment or inhibit speech; rather, it is forward looking, protecting the nation from a president whose continuance in office threatens the republic.

Accordingly, even if Trump’s statements would not count as “incitement” under cases limiting the government’s power to punish private speakers, the House is fully authorized to find that Trump’s actions constitute a high crime and misdemeanor. It really isn’t a close question. Trump’s statements in fact incited the mob to besiege the Capitol—and were part of a broader effort to subvert the democratic process. If anything, the article of impeachment against Trump vindicates core First Amendment interests. The right to participate in our political process means little if the president can use violence and threats to overturn election results.

The United States is a divided nation, but only a tiny fraction of Trump’s more than 74 million voters showed up in Washington, D.C., eager to fight. The way to unite this country is to isolate acts of violence—and a leader who incites it—from legitimate expression. Trump was a north star for a certain kind of radical.

What details? Details like Ayanna Pressley's panic button that was inexplicably removed from her office shows that there was a real plot afoot to harm members of congress, aided from the White House and by far-right cops in the Capitol Police:

KathyLauren said:
As people rushed out of other buildings on the Capitol grounds, staffers in Pressley’s office barricaded the entrance with furniture and water jugs that had piled up during the pandemic. Groh pulled out gas masks and looked for the special panic buttons in the office.

“Every panic button in my office had been torn out — the whole unit,” she said, though they could come up with no rationale as to why. She had used them before and hadn’t switched offices since then. As they were escorted to several different secure locations, Groh and Pressley and her husband tried to remain calm and vigilant — not only of rioters but of officers they did not know or trust, she said.

Queequeg said:
One question that has been rattling around in my head is this:

What do we do about the misinformation that underlies this whole thing?

Being honest - if the election actually was rigged, mass resistance and even overthrow of the illegitimate government would be expected, and from an American Mythology perspective, the right thing to do. The rationale for revolution is written into our Declaration of Independence. Founders of the United States rallied in protest of "Taxation without Representation."

But the facts bear out that the allegations of a fraudulent election are utterly false.

What we have is a factual information dissemination failure.

There's a couple components to this as I can figure -

1. The demagogues who are spreading claims of massive fraud.
2. The failure of a large segment of people to be able to process information and discern fact from lies.

Limiting the speech of the demagogues is problematic because free speech is one of the values we define ourselves by. I'll leave that question open to debate about what we can do, but I'm personally against restricting speech as a matter of principle. There is a part of me that understands cutting off the speech of irresponsible people with large megaphones is an option, but in my view, that's a last resort and if we have to do that, then the game is long over.

That leaves the people. I don't know what to do about that. Fundamentally, I'm afraid most people lack the basic intelligence to process the deluge of information. I know that I am unable to do so and am experimenting with limiting consumption of information to give my long form thought processes a chance to work again. I don't know if that's a solution for others, I don't know if that's a solution for myself.

I put that question to the floor with this quote from Thomas Jefferson that reading now is disconcerting.
Wonderful is the effect of impudent and persevering lying. The British ministry have so long hired their gazetteers to repeat and model into every form lies about our being in anarchy, that the world has at length believed them, the English nation has believed them, the ministers themselves have come to believe them, and what is more wonderful, we have believed them ourselves. Yet where does this anarchy exist? Where did it ever exist, except in the single instance of Massachusets? And can history produce an instance of a rebellion so honourably conducted? I say nothing of it’s motives. They were founded in ignorance, not wickedness. God forbid we should ever be 20. years without such a rebellion. The people can not be all, and always, well informed. The part which is wrong will be discontented in proportion to the importance of the facts they misconceive. If they remain quiet under such misconceptions it is a lethargy, the forerunner of death to the public liberty. We have had 13 states independant 11 years. There has been one rebellion. That comes to one rebellion in a century and a half for each state. What country before ever existed a century and half without a rebellion? And what country can preserve it’s liberties if their rulers are not warned from time to time that their people preserve the spirit of resistance? Let them take arms. The remedy is to set them right as to facts, pardon and pacify them. What signify a few lives lost in a century or two? The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is it’s natural manure.

The worst way to evaluate a teacher is to be concerned with how much they will benefit oneself. The best criteria is to observe how much they benefit others.

NatureTalk said:
As a thought experiment, let's imagine we're interested in the kinds of psychological topics which Buddhism addresses and so we want to find a teacher who can help us advance our understanding.   We're open minded at this early point in our investigation so maybe the teacher we choose will be Buddhist, or maybe someone from some other tradition, we're not sure yet.   How should we evaluate a teacher?  How to choose one over another?

I know very little about Buddhism so I will leave other members to address this question within that realm.  I know a bit more about what might generally be called "new age gurus" so I'll address that instead.

I've noticed that such teachers are typically surrounded by adoring students.   The teacher is perhaps sitting on a pillow in the spotlight on stage, the center of attention and respect etc.  Often the teacher is being somehow financially supported by the students, and thus doesn't need to get the kind of mundane job you and I might have.

When I see this very common setup I can't help but sometimes think to myself, "Geez, even I could be enlightened within that situation".  I really don't feel sarcastic or cynical so much as I would be attracted to a different kind of teacher.  Like for instance...

Let's say I'm working double shifts at a burger joint shoveling fries over the counter all day.  It's greasy, it's loud, everyone's impatient, the boss is kinda demanding, the pay sucks.  I'm getting worn out, grouchy and annoyed.  And then I look over at my co-worker and....

They're having a good time.  There's a relaxed smile on their face, they're humming some nice little tune, and seem entirely content with whatever anyone asks them to do.  And their contentment isn't just today, it's not just this moment or that moment, but a consistent pattern every time they show up to work, for the whole shift.  Nobody adores them, nobody supports them, they live in a dumpy little one bedroom apartment and ride a bike to work.  And that's cool with them, no problem.

Ok, so this is perhaps a ridiculously demanding criteria for a teacher.  Or maybe not.  Don't we want some teacher who can help us be at peace with the real world, and not just ideal situations?  Wouldn't the best evidence that a teacher can teach us how to be at peace in the real world be that the teacher themselves can do it?

What say you?

Which is one critique of the Popper quote from earlier. One of the possible ways Fascism operates is by getting liberal democracy to eat itself and become more authoritarian, due to it being seen as necessary to be "intolerant of intolerance". Fascists misappropriate free speech, and eventually get liberal democracy to restrict itself..this allows them a greater opening to present their "alternative" to it.

Arguably, this is a specious objection. This is not a problem in Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, etc. These countries do not even have a first amendment, but I do not see their democracies being thereby impacted. They also ban intolerant speech.

The term is dgongs pa, and the translation is not apt——it actually refers not to an intent per se, but a buddha's continuous state of samadhi, 24/7/365. It part of a progression that begins with mental focus (sems zin), concentration (dhyāna, bsam gtan), and samādhi (ting nge 'dzin). Translators try to deal with this usage in a variety of ways, none of which really capture the meaning, including my equivalent, "transcendent state" (from samati = dgongs pa).

The term dgongs pa can mean intention, but in regular Tibetan, it is commonly just an honorific for mind/thought (sems).

Less well known is the paradox of tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.—In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant.

Honestly I think this is a bad idea.  The story will be - vindictive democrats pursue tired impeachment nonsense again when the poor man only has days left in office.  What they should have done is demanded a public inquiry at the start of the next congressional session.  If/when the republicans try to block that, first they will fail, because they no longer control the senate, second they will look like the obstructionists they are.  Over the next few weeks some unpleasant facts will come to light over who encouraged and orchestrated this, and that will be a much better basis for action against trump and others.

The best thing that Antifa and BLM did in DC last week was NOT SHOW UP. Because fascists, by their nature, will engage in violence even without provocation. If you think the only place I object to fascists is here, well, of course not. The reason I am not out standing somewhere is COVID.

That said, relying on the state to fight fascism (rather than simply use is it as an opportunity to further state power) is also a position which is in opposition to available evidence.

Malcolm wrote:
We are the state. That is what it means to live in a democracy. The state is not something other than the voters, who put people in power. This kind of rhetoric is actually much of the problem. It causes people to think they are not responsible, when in fact it is their votes, or lack of votes, which govern these issues. Not enough people voted in 1968, 1972, 1980, 1984, 1988, 2000, 2004, and 2016. What is happening now is a direct consequence of lack of voter participation in those years.

Since we are the state, we should make sure that our interests are represented, so that institutions like the FBI, Justice Dept, etc., function in our interests. There really is no other way.

The Shingon Risshu tradition is supposed to be extant and if so, they should, in theory, be following a full vinaya system.
I could be wrong about this, but my understanding is that, the same as the other Japanese Buddhist schools, the Risshu school was forcibly secularized during the Meiji-era haibutsu kishaku "reforms" (for lack of a better word).  There are individual Japanese priests or temples that follow the Dharmaguptaka vinaya but, to the best of my knowledge, the Dharmaguptaka lineage itself has died out in Japan.

It is clear there was a coordinated attempt to make it happen, depriving police of manpower, refusing to release the National Guard, it has all the earmarks of an actual plot. The only reason it did not succeed is that was done under the guise of a "mob gone wild," rather than a specific military operation, which would have stood out and been more easy to prevent.

The free speech argument is bogus. Those assholes still have free speech. Anytime Twittler wants, he can have a press conference. He could have even done a Chavez, a weekly Sunday show for six hours. He still can, for another 9 days.

I fully support the right of dumb motherf@#kers to vote for the idiots of their choice. If they win, as they did in 2016, I may not like the consequences, but as long as THEY DO NOT COMMIT TREASON AND FOMENT AN OVERTHROW OF THE GOVERNMENT THROUGH LIES AND VIOLENCE, I live with it.

I didn't like living under Reagan or Bush I, but I never thought the GOP was going to be involved in a plot to overthrow the government. I didn't even think this was a possibility under Bush II, since the GOP was still somewhat chastened by the memory of Nixon.

I never contested Trump's election or called foul. I did point out that Trump is a fascist. Over and over again in fact. I warned people that this was likely to happen. Thank goodness he lost he election by a huge margin. But here is the point: HE REFUSED TO CONCEDE, STILL REFUSES TO CONCEDE, AND IS A MENACE TO SOCIETY. Not only is he a menace to US society, he is a world menace, Napoleon level. America really only has to blame itself, but the lies about Clinton got into people's heads, and due to a fluke, and some bad judgment on the part of Comey, Russian agitprop, etc., Trump got in and ran the greatest grift in world history. You are going to be reading about the full extent of it for years to come. And so now, it comes to an end, and sadly, for all those people that got caught up in his grift, there will be serious consequences, jail time, probation, and for the specific people involved in beating that cop to death inside the capital building, yes, death sentences——which in this case I FULLY SUPPORT.

Right now, however, Trump and his band of insurrectionists need to be shut down hard, for the good of America and for the good of the world. Good thing we have Pelosi, the FBI, etc., on the job, doing just that. Lord knows that the GOP are feckless cowards.

And don’t give me your “what about BLM?” The idea that BLM or Antifa evenly remotely had any interest in hanging the Vice President of the United States and executing senators and representatives if they refused to go along with Trump’s plot to overturn the election is totally absurd.

I agree. The traditional media used to abuse that power in the past, and would still today if not for their increasing irrelevance. But they had explicit agendas and were subject to regulations on content. The social media companies are worse because they represent no position and are subject to no effective regulation - they simply sell access to and information on voters to the highest bidder.

Unknown said:
Sec. 2.  Policy.  (a)  It is the policy of the United States to prosecute to the fullest extent permitted under Federal law, and as appropriate, any person or any entity that destroys, damages, vandalizes, or desecrates a monument, memorial, or statue within the United States or otherwise vandalizes government property.  The desire of the Congress to protect Federal property is clearly reflected in section 1361 of title 18, United States Code, which authorizes a penalty of up to 10 years’ imprisonment for the willful injury of Federal property.  More recently, under the Veterans’ Memorial Preservation and Recognition Act of 2003, section 1369 of title 18, United States Code, the Congress punished with the same penalties the destruction of Federal and in some cases State-maintained monuments that honor military veterans.  Other criminal statutes, such as the Travel Act, section 1952 of title 18, United States Code, permit prosecutions of arson damaging monuments, memorials, and statues on State grounds in some cases.  Civil statutes like the Public System Resource Protection Act, section 100722 of title 54, United States Code, also hold those who destroy certain Federal property accountable for their offenses.  The Federal Government will not tolerate violations of these and other laws.

(b)  It is the policy of the United States to prosecute to the fullest extent permitted under Federal law, and as appropriate, any person or any entity that participates in efforts to incite violence or other illegal activity in connection with the riots and acts of vandalism described in section 1 of this order.  Numerous Federal laws, including section 2101 of title 18, United States Code, prohibit the violence that has typified the past few weeks in some cities.  Other statutes punish those who participate in or assist the agitators who have coordinated these lawless acts.  Such laws include section 371 of title 18, United States Code, which criminalizes certain conspiracies to violate Federal law, section 2 of title 18, United States Code, which punishes those who aid or abet the commission of Federal crimes, and section 2339A of title 18, United States Code, which prohibits as material support to terrorism efforts to support a defined set of Federal crimes.  Those who have joined in recent violent acts around the United States will be held accountable.

He has the "never say die" spirit. After some of his severest set-backs he has been able to get his immediate associates together and begin making plans for a "come-back"."

Courts are not instruments through which parties engage in such gamesmanship or symbolic political gestures. As a result, at the conclusion of this litigation, the Court will determine whether to issue an order to show cause why this matter should not be referred to its Committee on Grievances for potential discipline of Plaintiffs’ counsel.

Malcolm wrote:
He actually asked Raffensberger to commit voter fraud by "recalculating" the votes" and finding 11,800" votes for Trump The lawyer on the call should disbarred for even suggesting that GA turn over private voter information to the Trump campaign. This is a serious felony both at the federal and the state level, and it is a direct result of the gutless GOP not impeaching the bastard when they had the opportunity. They still have sixteen days though.

In one article I read on Lionsroar.com, it lead me to believe that there is a philosophical split between Madhyamaka and Yogacara and one could not follow both schools. I am assuming from some of the answers, this conclusion may have been wrong.

Malcolm wrote:
In most Tibetan Buddhist schools, Madhyamaka is the highest viewpoint, with the Yogacāra school's perspective held as being inferior. This hierarchy is also enshrined in tantras such as Hevajra, where Madhyamaka is held to be superior to Yogacāra.

There is a lot of modern scholarship however, which tries to reinterpret yogacāra in better light. I personally don't find it very convincing, but others do.

Plaintiffs’ theory that all of these laws are unconstitutional and that the Court should instead require state legislatures themselves to certify every Presidential election lies somewhere between a willful misreading of the Constitution and fantasy...

Yet even that may be letting Plaintiffs off the hook too lightly. Their failure to make any effort to serve or formally notify any Defendant — even after reminder by the Court in its Minute Order — renders it difficult to believe that the suit is meant seriously. Courts are not instruments through which parties engage in such gamesmanship or symbolic political gestures. As a result, at the conclusion of this litigation, the Court will determine whether to issue an order to show cause why this matter should not be referred to its Committee on Grievances for potential discipline of Plaintiffs’ counsel.

I still get the impression that they are stating nothing truly exists.


Malcolm wrote:
Yes, if by "truly" you mean "ultimately."

The Geluks make a distinction between "mere existence", which is not an object of analysis, and "true existence," which is an object of analysis. In Geluk Madhyamaka, the mode of investigation is to search for inherent existence in a given thing.

So yes, the Geklukpas are saying nothing truly exists, and that things exist merely on a conventional level, which cannot withstand ultimate analysis.

Nicholas2727 said:
Would they also say that consciousness does not ultimately exist?

Malcolm wrote:
Consciousness is a dependently arising dharma. So not, it does not ultimately exist.

Nicholas2727 said:
I would be curious how this fits with Madhyamaka philosophy. From my very limited understanding, Madhyamaka is supposed to be the middle way between nihilism and externalism. If they say nothing ultimately exists how is this between nihilism and eternalism?

Malcolm wrote:
Whatever is dependently originated, that is empty, that is dependently designated, and that is the middle way.

That which arises dependently is free from the extremes of permanence and annihilation. You might try reading Tsongkhapa's Praise to Dependent Origination. Many people consider it Tsongkhapa's final statement on his realization of emptiness.


Nicholas2727 said:
Also from my understanding, many Sakyapas hold the Rangtong view of emptiness. Does there interpretation match with the Gelug view that nothing ultimately exists?

Malcolm wrote:
There is no such thing as a rang stong view of emptiness unless one holds a gzhan stong view of emptiness. Since neither the Sakyas nor the Geluks hold a gzhan stong view of emptiness, they cannot maintain a rang stong view of emptiness.

Tathagatagarbha texts such as the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra use positive language to discuss things like Buddha Nature. In that text, for instance, the Buddha flips his usual script a bit, declaring that reality is marked by permanence, bliss, true self, and purity. Some people read that and think, "Oh, the Buddha actually teaches Self!" They think its license to reify their naive and mistaken notions about conventional self and call it "True Self!". But that's not what the text actually says. The caveat of emptiness still applies. These words are not some final "truth" but rather a therapeutic convention to bring people back from the desiccated absorption in the one-sided view of emptiness only, ie. the view of emptiness that forgets that emptiness is only found in conventions.  This is illustrated by the parable of the king's physician in, iirc, chapter 5.

The most important sutras in Tibetan Buddhism are the Perfection of Wisdom Sutras, specifically those in 25,000 lines and 8,000 lines. This is evident from the fact that in India and Tibet more commentaries have been written on these two sutras than any other sutras.

Snowbeast said:
So this is just something I have been interested in for a while. Does anyone know if there are any schools of Buddhism that do not require a four year degree for ordination? It seems like most Japanese schools do, Jodo Shinshu definitely does, and in Jodo Shu the training for monks is equivalent to a four year degree. Are there any schools that do all of the training for becoming a monk or priest within the temple? Are there any Buddhist varieties  that require a long training session but it is not related to western style four year education? If anyone could explain how ordination works in their particular school it would be very interesting to hear.

Can be be charged with a crime?  Well, seditious conspiracy requires a plan that involves use of force, and that element will be hard to show.  Attempted electoral fraud seems like a safer bet, though there would be a good defence available that he’s simply deluded and thinks he did win.

The shocking part of this is how few republicans are willing to stand up and condemn his behavior.  They’re hiding behind the letter of the law - claiming ‘concerns’, demanding an ‘investigation’, and threatening to use their (lawful) right to object to the ballot count on the 6th January.  All of which is probably legal, but it’s still treason, it’s contrary to their oath of office and harmful to their country.  And the Republican Party is fine with it.

Someone pointed out to me recently that, appropriately enough, 'senator' is an anagram of 'treason'.

They are fascists, by the commonly-used definition of the term.  They do not believe in democracy.  Congress can, and should expel them. This is as simple as a referral to a committee then a passed resolution.  In the past it has expelled members for supporting the confederacy, but the power to expel can be for failure to maintain appropriate standards of conduct, and on that, they have clearly failed. We've had 58 lawsuits over the election, all have been thrown out, all have found no factual basis for claiming misconduct in the election. This is now established fact reviewed by multiple state and federal courts, up to and including the supreme court.  Any member of congress who signs onto an objection to the electoral count now should be expelled.
