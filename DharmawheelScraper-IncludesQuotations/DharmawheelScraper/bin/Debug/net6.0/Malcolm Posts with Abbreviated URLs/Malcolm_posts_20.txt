No-self and not-self are an integral attribute of phenomena, including human beings. So is self or Atman. Although humans demonstrate temporality and non-substantiality, they also possess the truth of the Middle Way (Tientai) which means that the true nature of phenomena is that they are neither non-substantial nor temporarily existent but they display attributes of both. Non-self or Anatman is a partial or provisional teaching, failing to take into account the eternal reality of phenomena.

You don’t understand the middle way. You just fell into the third extreme, asserting that things both exist and do not exist.

The shocking part of this is how few republicans are willing to stand up and condemn his behavior.  They’re hiding behind the letter of the law - claiming ‘concerns’, demanding an ‘investigation’, and threatening to use their (lawful) right to object to the ballot count on the 6th January.  All of which is probably legal, but it’s still treason, it’s contrary to their oath of office and harmful to their country.  And the Republican Party is fine with it.

What ties a stream together over infinite lifetimes from beginningless time is the false grasping at the aggregates as "I and mine." Nothing more is needed to account for the beginningless and endless (until awakening) series of births. After awakening of course, since the three kāyas are inseparable and because sentient beings are endless, buddhas do not abide in nirvana but continue to aid sentient beings in samsara for as long as there is a samsara.

Thus the Appearance, thus the Nature, and thus the Essence of the common mortal also has no beginning and no end.

The Preta Oblation Rite

To be without obstacles at all times, place food and water into a clean vessel and it is proper to also bless it with the three syllables. It is also fine without the blessing, and there isn’t any fault. Recite seven times the mantra Namaḥ samantabuddhanaṃ, namaḥ sarvatathāgata avalokite oṃ sambhara sambhara hūṃ. A great stream of nectar flows forth from the fingers of one’s outstretched right hand. Then, filling the vast and wide vessel, imagine that all ghosts equal with space are satisfied. Seal with snapping one’s fingers three times.

Also if one wishes to do that extensively, after reciting the mantra seven times, since one says “I prostrate to Tathāgata Very Precious” imagine that oblation becomes inconceivable enjoyments of whatever is desired. Say “I prostrate to Tathāgata Sublime Form”, imagine that the mouths and throats of the ghosts become vast and beautified. Say “I prostrate to the Tathāgata Abundant Soft Body” and imagine that after the ghosts are satisfied with food, the discomfort of their bodies, the destination of Kukula hell and so on is pacified. Say “I prostrate to Tathāgata Free from All Fear” and imagine the ghosts are very happy with without the fear of fighting, strife and robbing one another over food. Then snap one’s finger seven times and tell them to depart to their own places.

His polemics against other buddhists are chapters 4 and 5, śrāvakas and yogacārins respectively.

Following his polemics against Vedantins, he then goes after Mimamsa in chapter 10. Vaiṣesika is negated in 7 and 8, Samkhya in 6. He offers his proof of a buddha's omniscience in 11. Chapters 1-3 lay out his vision of Buddhist practice.

No empowerment, no guru; no guru, no samaya. Claiming one is doing Vajrayana practice when one has not received empowerment is like claiming one is bhikshu without having received ordination. Unfortunately, these days the latter will always be more strongly condemned than the former, even though former is a more serious problem.

What is at stake here is the question: how is gnosis accomplished through guru-yoga?

And the point is: if you have previously cultivated the ground, you may not need the 4th empowerment in order for realisations to ripen.

Without empowerment, one does not have a guru in this life.

You don’t know who your guru was in your past life. So what do you do, guess? In any case, Mahayana does not have the practice of guru yoga.


tobes said:
The further point is: there is much more variability here than you are suggesting. It is as variable as all the different karmic dispositions in all the different disciples, on all the different stages of the path - from pure beginner to advanced bodhisattva.


Malcolm wrote:
You either have the karmic disposition for Vajrayana or you don’t. And if you don’t it takes two asamkhyakalpas to hit the eighth bhumi, and one more for buddhahood.

If you don’t receive Vajrayana empowerment there are no extraordinary means in sutra by which you might attain even the path of seeing in this life, and that is not related to guru devotion. There is no sutra that teaches guru devotion as a cause for rapid attainment of buddhahood, despite the encouragement to venerate teachers. It’s just part of general merit accumulation. So if you were a Vajrayani in a past life, but did not meet Vajrayana in this life (through lack of merit, since this is the only reason one would fail to meet Vajrayana again), there are no means by which you can “ride the fumes” of your past life practice of Vajrayana to realization in this life.

PS Your implication that there was a woeful shortage of explanation is one with which I can wholeheartedly concur.

Malcolm wrote:
The gnosis aroused by guru yoga depends on the introduction of the fourth empowerment. Without it, the seed of that gnosis is not planted.

But those faithful students who persevered certainly received empowerments eventually, or at least they created a positive dharma link.

The fruit of guru yoga is the realization of the great perfection or mahāmudra. Without introduction or empowerment, I very much doubt the necessary ground has been prepared nor the seeds planted to result in either fruit.

I don't mean to be harsh, but for a tradition which holds up samaya all the time as being the foundation of the path, people seem to disregard it a lot based in this or that justification.

I've heard it from a number of sources that Ngondro can serve as a complete path to enlightenment, rather than being thought of merely as "preliminaries."

I am curious if you yourself, or anyone you know of, has decided to practice Ngondro this way, devoting themselves to it completely as a self-contained path and never receiving higher transmissions, teachings, etc. Have there been any famous historical figures known for a devotion to "Ngondro only"?

Just curious about this perspective. I think it would be a noble path indeed, and a singularly humble one. I think in many if not most beginners' minds, there is an at-least-subconscious tendency to be offput by the "preliminary" label. (Not to mention the physical stress of all the prostrations, etc.).

Sorry, Japan just isn't that special in this regard. 25 to 50 million of those people lived in Europe. That's slightly less than six million people a year in various parts of Europe. Depending on whose estimates you read, in one year, 40-60 percent of England's population died. Its population was between 3.7 and 5.7 million in 1347. So, basically the same as Japan.

E-ma-ho! In the grand play of deep awareness, all lands and regions are vajra-fields; the structures majestic vajra-palaces; oceans of clouds of Samantabhadra offerings billow forth. The objects of enjoyment possess every glory wished; all dwelling therein are actual viras and virinis; not even the words "impurity" or "flaw" exist: nothing is less than infinitely pure.

Many times the buddhas and bodhisattvas have and continue to manifest themselves as humans, gods, demons, yakshas, nagas, and so forth, including rakshasas. Buddhas and bodhisattvas make themselves available to each and every sentient being, there is no land or country where they do not manifest. So I don't see what's so troubling about identifying these emanations. The Avatamsaka Sutra explicitly states that bodhisattvas on the first bhumi often manifest as leaders of countries to benefit beings.

Zopa Rinpoche's thoughts on Queen Victoria come from Serkong Tsenshab Rinpoche, which I believe in turn come from the 13th Dalai Lama's identification. The Manchu emperors were long held by (mainly Gelug, I suppose) lamas to be emanations of Manjushri, especially Qianlong. If it helps, there is a Korean master and his students who also believe Qianlong to be a tulku. And yet the same Qianlong ordered the Dzungar genocide.

Malcolm wrote:
As queens go, Victoria was a pretty good one. But remember, Āryadeva points out that monarchs are fools when they think they deserve their power, and forget their power comes from the people they govern.

As for genocides, you really think the Qianlong emperor was a Mañjuśṛī emanation. This is clearly just a result of political favoritism.

Likewise, there is the well known story from the early Tibetan histories such as the Testimony of Ba and the Pillar Testament identifying Songtsen Gampo as Avalokitesvara in the story of the two Khotanese monks, who were terrified when they saw that this supposed bodhisattva inflicted such cruel punishments and mass executions on his subjects, yet had their doubts dispelled by Manjushri.

Malcolm wrote:
Through this casuistry, you might as well argue that no one can ever commit negative karma through killing, stealing, and rape of another. After all, you just claimed that all suffering comes from ourselves. Certainly this is not the intention of the Buddha.

There isn't much literature that isn't more racist than the Mahāvamsa, the telling of the Buddhist subjugation of the indigenous population of Śṛī Lanka in the second century BCE by King Dutugamunu, but Rama's war against Ravana and his cannibal legions predates it by many centuries, how many, we just don't know, perhaps around 1,000 BCE. Supposedly, the earliest portions of the Ramayāna date from around 700-500 BCE.

However, by the time such myths arrived in Tibet they have been so divorced from actual historical content, that their racism does not exist for Tibetans, who considered themselves, in one telling, to be descendants of srin pos and monkeys.

One interesting factoid: the language of Madagascar has only one cognate language in the world——the language of the headhunters of Borneo.

Madagascar was colonized by Indians during the 8th century, who established colonies of Indian merchants on the island. Templeman speculates it was they who hired him to tame the indigenous people, known to us as "rakṣasa."

Hi all!

For those who may be familiar with the Dzogchen tradition and its main open awareness meditation, I’ve become aware of different suggestions as to how long sittings should be. Some say that the sittings should be short (5-10 minutes) and more frequent so as to support the ease and effortlessness of the approach, and to dissolve egoic tendencies through ‘nonmeditation’. Others say that sittings should be longer (30-45 minutes) as habitual tendencies are ingrained over a number of years and so should be tackled with more sitting. I’m not too sure where I stand on this, and so would much appreciate any help or suggestions from those of you who are practiced in the Dzogchen tradition and could help to shed light on this particular aspect of the practice

McConnell is a good illustration of why the democrats need to change their entire approach.

The role of senate majority leader is not defined in the constitution, any law or any rules resolution of the senate. It is purely customary. The Vice President as leader of the senate recognizes the senate majority leader when senate business commences, who for that reason has the power to set the agenda. No written rule requires the VP to do that.

Suppose Kamala Harris was VP of a Republican senate.  Nothing stops her from recognizing a Democrat, who could then introduce legislation. Sure, the republicans could then vote it down, but they would have to vote.  What McConnell does is avoid having people like Lisa Murkowski embarrass themselves by voting down popular legislation: he simply keeps it off the floor. This would result in a lot of marginal legislation actually getting passed.  Of course the republicans would describe this as an unprecedented breach of rules and norms but...they have been doing that in so many ways for over a decade with the senate.

If they want to start putting wins on the board, they need to start playing by the new rules.

This is an interesting discussion, but the fact is that we can never know what "Original Buddhism" was like, and the urge to say it was either this or that is usually based on peoples' preconceptions, and desires of what they think it should have been.

Pointing to masonry structures at traditionally Buddhist sites as evidence that Buddha's followers lived in them from the beginning, however, is pretty risky; a lot of Buddhist sites that have been excavated show considerable changes over the centuries as shown in different historical strata. Sites like Jetavanarama may be nothing like they were when the Buddha was around. As Malcolm pointed out, stone structures are not the same as grass huts, and to take the pictures of Buddha's alleged retreat dwelling as even approximating the footprint of what he stayed in requires a huge leap of faith. Yes, the Harappan civilization used stone, but we cannot assume that the Gangetic Plain civilizations followed suit and maintained a cultural continuity in that way unless there is some evidence, which there is not. It's a big mistake to think of "Indian civilization" a s a unified whole, especially in the earliest periods..

As far as the Vinaya, everyone knows there are many versions. Pace Aemilius, I don't know of any modern scholar who thinks there is a single authoritative Vinaya that used to be longer than the existing versions. The quotes from the Chinese may refer to the Dharmaguptakas, as they were the most important school in the early period of translation, being gradually superseded by the Sarvastivadins. It's also important to remember that Vinayas were not written down for a long, long time -- the earliest Chinese converts expressed exasperation that the Indian and Central Asian monks they were getting Buddhist texts from did not have "hard copies" of the Vinaya, it being based wholly on memorization.

Bronkhurst's and Schopen's books are quite interesting, and certainly prompt one to re-examine assumptions about early Buddhism and the actual historical evidence we have, or don't have, in relation to the received tradition. For my money, one of Bronkhurst's most useful observations is that Buddhism cannot be seen as a derivative of or a reaction to "Hinduism", because the two germinated in different geographic regions and subcultures of the Indian subcontinent.  I also think it is undeniable that Buddhism underwent huge changes in institutional structure during the Maurya and Kushan periods.

It's not merely the words a guru speaks, nor is it merely the ritual gestures of empowerment, etc.  At the end of the day, though, faith and confidence in a teacher is something that can't be measured or explained.

In reality, Gelug Madhyamaka is transmitted, not merely read, not merely studied textually. And it will be transmitted in different ways depending on the dispositions of the disciple. This is why the cartoon version does not fly: it refuses upaya even though all this questions are, in the final analysis, matters of upaya.

Arguably, the Sakyas escaped similar monastic censure in Western Tibet because of their distance and prestige. The Nyingmapas experienced an increase in fortunes during the same period, due to the patronage of the Great 5th.

That is not correct. The Gelugpas would install a number of Gelug monks at rival monasteries within the administrative reach of the Lhasa gvt. So, Jonang and Gelug monks, or Sakya and Gelug monks, etc., would inhabit the same monasteries, each practicing their own tradition. What is true is that in Central Tibet, block prints of Taranatha, Dolbupa, Gorampa, the Karmapa, etc, any one who criticized Tsongkhapa were locked up and forbidden to be printed. Thus however did not prevent the distribution of manuscripts. The actual situation on the ground was far more complicated than your simplistic assessment would indicate.

Bill Clinton reduced the size of the US Military, as Obama. Trump, contrary to some people's fantasies, was gearing up for a major international war with Iran, and has increased military spending in each successive year since 2016. He may still attack Iran yet. After all, he has 5 weeks and 2 days left to do so.

Aspirational bodhicitta is the wish to attain buddhahood for the benefit of all beings. Engaged bodhicitta is the practice of the six perfections.

Ultimate bodhicitta also has two components: the path and the result. The path consists of śamatha, or calm abiding meditation; and vipaśyanā, or insight. The result is the realization of ultimate truth: all phenomena, including nirvana, buddhas, etc., lack inherent existence.

Sanskrit, as the learned language of Ancient India, thus existed alongside the Prakrits (vernaculars), which evolved into the modern Indo-Aryan languages (Hindi, Nepali, Assamese, Marathi, Konkani, Urdu, and Bengali)."

"Anyway, bodhisattvas can’t save anyone."...well, the argument can be made in a Prajnaparamita sort of sense, and probably based on other sources...but those who take the Bodhisattva Vows promise to liberate them all anyway.

Is that transpersonal gnosis dual or nondual? If it is the former, it cannot be an ultimate gnosis since it is dualistic; if it is the latter, dualistic appearances cannot appear within a nondual gnosis. Further, if dualistic appearances are manifesting in this gnosis, like reflections in a mirror, it must be a personal gnosis (as suggested by the term pratyatmyavedanajñāna, i.e. the gnosis that one intuits individually), rather than a transpersonal gnosis, because if it were a transpersonal gnosis everyone would experience it at the same time just as it was, and buddhahood would be impossible. If it is a personal gnosis, then dualistic outer appearances can manifest to it, without that gnosis becoming dualistic, and without outer, dependently-originated, apparent phenomena being "mind only." And this is what is means to say that all appearances are included in sugatagarbha, which is just the gnosis that one intuits individually (look it up). There is a difference between appearances and apparent objects, even in gzhan stong. Appearances are like the moon in the water, apparent objects are like the moon. No moon, no reflection; no water, no reflection.

I can understand the subtle mind giving rise to Vedana and perception etc but not the other way around.if the caittas come from cittas then when one citta perishes how can its caittas give rise to another new subtle mind wich hosts the mental factors ?what I mean by this is that if caittas are dependant on cittas to exist,then when one citta perishes how can its caittas give rise to a new citta with its own caittas?if this happens in the case where one citta perishes only after its subsequent citta arises due to the former's caittas,there would be confused experience and multiple selves at once wouldn't there?

How does caitta create citta?how can something give rise to something else completely new?if arising cannot be established at all,then there must be only one citta.thats the point of OP.

Malcolm wrote:
Caittas do not create cittas; cittas and caittas arise together and support one another. A citta arises when there is sensory contact with an object, either physical or mental. For example, when the eye organ and a form meet, there is an eye consciousness. When the mental organ and a caitta meet, there is a mental consciousness, etc. caittas are the objects of a citta. That’s how caittas support cittas.

I just last night read something of Taranatha on this subject. A short treatise you can find here: https://dzokden.org/read/library/study/ ... mentaries/.

What he says about the Rangtong treating the second turning of the wheel of Dharma as definitive and the third (as well as the first) as provisional is very interesting. Firstly, I would like to know if this is true? If so, it strikes me as problematic.

Malcolm wrote:
The whole theory of the three turnings of the wheel is problematic, actually. There isn't any agreement which sutras are "third turning."

The Indian masters paid no attention to the three turnings at all. As a doctrine it finds no place in Dzogchen teachings at all until after the thirteenth century. The Sakyapas largely ignore it.

The Gelukpas treat the second turning as definitive.

Some teachers include the tathāgatagarbha sūtras in this category (though the Indian Yogacāra master themselves were skeptical of tathāgatagarbha theory, since they advocated the theory of the icchantika, Madhyāmikas were actually more open to it than Yogacārins).

This is mostly a Tibetan trip, based on the commentary of the Korean Master Wongchuk on the Samdhinirmocana Sūtra, translated during the imperial period.

shankara said:
The "Mahaparinirvana Sutra" is apparently of the third turning, and personally I think it is the most definitive of all Sutras (excepting perhaps the Lotus) due to it being the last preached before the death of Shakyamuni. Does the Rangtong school really regard this Sutra as provisional?

Malcolm wrote:
There is no such thing as a "rang stong school," except in the eyes of gzhan stong pas.

Generally speaking, everyone in India, including the Yogacāra masters, regarded the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras as definitive in meaning. We know this for example because Virupa, who had been a Yogacāra master prior to his awakening, carried a copy of the PP in 8000 lines with him everywhere he travelled.

I guess I started my practice wrong.

I harbored a combination of eternalist and nihilist views when I came to Buddhism. It took me some time to eradicate those. Some years really.

If I hadn’t had faith in my teacher I wouldn’t have persevered.

I’d get a text and not understand anything and pray and learn the first word I didn’t understand. Then the second. And so on. In time I found myself with madhyamaka and experiential exercises related to emptiness, nature of mind. But it took years.

According to these criteria you present, I should not have started until I had an understanding of dependent origination. I find that a very very very deep and subtle topic. It took a long time to get my mind around, and even now it still gets deeper. It took years and years.

Malcolm wrote:
The difference between you and the OP is that you clearly wanted to change your view, and understood already that you did not have correct view. So you tried to discover that.

But in general, I would not recommend that people who do not understand the basics of Mahāyāna Buddhism seek to enter Vajrayāna right away. Otherwise, people who try to practice Vajrayāna without a correct view of emptiness simply wind up taking rebirth as rudras, they either negate cause and result because they have an annihilationist view, or they negate cause and result because they have an eternalist view. But you are talking to someone who wept when first reading the Perfection of Wisdom sūtras, and whose hair stood on end when hearing the word "śunyatā."

I think that to completely rid oneself of doubt about anything, one would have to become something of a 'true believer' in the cultish sense. Doubt is a natural part of the process of thinking things through and developing understanding. Personally I have serious doubts about the Prasangika, and am not entirely convinced that the "Tirthika" paths are so useless as many people seem to think them to be.

This doesn't mean I'm not engaging in practice, familiarizing myself with teachings on emptiness in order to meditate on them, or taking refuge in non-Buddhist teachers. I figure so long as I'm undergoing such a process, practicing sincerely, then I'm pretty much on the right track. I'm also pretty sure that there are plenty of Vajrayana practitioners in "the same boat", but who have faith in the method if not complete and unquestioning acceptance of the entire philosophy (of whatever particular school of Vajrayana that may be, and there do seem to be some pretty serious conflicts between each of them...)

Malcolm wrote:
It is not even possible to practice any Vajrayāna sadhana if one lacks conviction in emptiness. How can one practice Vajrayāna methods if one lacks confidence in Vajrayāna view? It is not necessary to be a Prasangika. It is simply necessary to have conviction in emptiness ala the Heat Sūtra. That is sufficient.

Basically, if one reads the Heart Sūtra and is freaked out by it, rejects its message and so on, one is not a candidate for receiving Vajrayāna teachings, any Vajrayāna teachings, including Dzogchen.

Buddha spoke about three gates of liberation: signlessness, emptiness, and wishlessness. He did not mention a fourth anywhere.

About the first point, for instance, who decide that a vow made by myself is not right discipline? Different Buddhist traditions have different vows, so who decide which is right?

Malcolm wrote:
Right discipline has been presented by the Buddha in many sources, both the Pali Canon and Mahāyāna. In general, a vow is something one receives from a preceptor. There is a broad consensus across Buddhist traditions that taking such a vows from a preceptor renders the virtue generated by that vow a much more powerful karma. The basic reason for this is that you are entering into a community of practitioners. Just as a man who watches a hundred people kill another man and approves of it receives one hundred times more negative karma than if he just killed a man himself, likewise, someone who takes Buddhist precepts generates as much merit from that as there are people who have also take those precepts.

Self-made vows do not have that force because there is no community to support them.

And when it comes to Vajrayāna, wrong view is actually a root downfall, that is, abandoning the view of freedom from extremes.

As for the first point: you don't really seem to understand the perspective of vows in Buddhism. A vow you make up yourself is not actually considered right discipline. It is a discipline, sure, but it is not connected with the eight fold path of noble ones.

As for the second point, I addressed that. When you make offerings to a monastic, you are not really making offerings to a person; you are making offerings to an ideal—that people can awaken through the practice of discipline, samadhi, and wisdom.

The Sangha represents that ideal.

I suspect you have not studied these issues carefully, based on your answers. Clearly, at this point in your life, becoming Buddhist monk, a member of the ordained Sangha, is not for you.

First, one does not make these vows silently, in one’s head. There is no self-ordination in Buddhadharma, not even to become an upasaka.

You receive vows in specific rites, which vary from order to order, while the general outline is the same.

Second, the object is free of affliction. Now, while today monastics are probably not even stream entrants, they still represent arhats. As such, they are representative of the Buddha’s Noble Sangha.

But no one would argue there was no merit to supporting undernourished children, but not as much. Why? One has no idea how that person will turn out. The Sangha jewel is only virtuous.

To give an idea of how varied Shentong can be, this is Brunnhölzl talking about Mikyo Dorje (H.H.Karmapa 8).
“When the Clouds Part” p.73: The Karmapa emphasizes that the tathāgata heart is the only ultimately real entity, which is permanent and able to perform functions (such as enlightened activity). He also repeatedly says that the tathāgata heart and sentient beings are mutually exclusive since sentient beings are nothing but the sum of adventitious stains. Thus, sentient beings neither possess nor are the tathāgata heart. This also means that it is not the case that buddha nature exists in sentient beings, but sentient beings (seem to) exist in buddha nature, just like clouds floating in the sky without affecting it.
So here Buddha Nature, which originally was 100% about sentient beings, in this “Empty-of-Other” presentation excludes sentient beings. Kinda suggests that it is transpersonal—at least in HHK8’s interpretation. So don’t think there’s one Shentong view.

Note also Buddha Nature is described as “...the only ultimately real entity, which is permanent and able to perform functions (such as enlightened activity).”

So, which one are you talking about and in what way is he a perennialist?
This way, from the Wikipedia article:
The perennial philosophy (Latin: philosophia perennis), also referred to as perennialism and perennial wisdom, is a perspective in philosophy and spirituality that views all of the world's religious traditions as sharing a single, metaphysical truth or origin from which all esoteric and exoteric knowledge and doctrine has grown.
Also why are you associating perennialism with Shentong?
From the same Wikipedia article the next sentence is: Perennialism has its roots in the Renaissance interest in neo-Platonism and its idea of the One, from which all existence emanates.

Just joking.

No Vajrayana school will support these views.

But it doesn't matter (this is directly in opposition to our friend who claims that your view constitutes a root downfall from the start).

People start in different places.  There was once a Mahasiddha who began completely as an eternalist, just like you**.  He was actually sort of tricked  into practicing Buddhist tantra because his guru was actually a Buddhist sadhu and not a Hindu sadhu (I don't quite know the correct term here - if this happened nowadays we would say his guru wasn't actually an adherent of Sanātana dharma).

It doesn't really matter.  The main thing is turning to the accumulation of merit, turning away from the pursuit of negativities, deepening lovingkindness and compassion.  Wisdom grows from that.

If you feel that you want to "use Vajrayana Buddhism" to develop your compassion and positive qualities then go for it.

I read the golden light sutra and sanghata sutra and It says that you will basically never abandon the dharma or stray from the path once you’ve read it and I’ve recited mantras from Gelug sources at that which promise a last rebirth in the womb and no retrogression so I don’t think I will ever leave Buddhism explicitly though my understanding of it may be faulty due to human error and karma and imperfections .

So I need a buddhism that will accommodate by brahman view.I heard some kagyus and Jonangpa believe in this .should I follow them?

I’m not here to argue wether I’m wrong or right I just want to stay in buddhism and have a school wich can accommodate my seeming unshakeable view in a brahman.

I want to badly have a place in vajrayana but I have some beliefs I can’t let go of.one of these is a undifferentiated ultimate reality.I have read plotinus arguments for the one in his works,father spitzer and ramanuja and Shankara in their Brahma sutra commentaries when dealing with momentary consciousness aswell as the govindabhasya to the Brahma sutras and I am convinced based on all these authors that A permanent unconditioned self exists.I have read both arguments for momentariness and arguments against a self from various authors in Indian literature but remain unconvinced by their arguments and I just can’t let go of this belief.oh well that’s my karma.I have read the debates between nayaiyikas and mimamsaka and Buddhists who espoused a momentary consciousness and I was convinced a self exists.

I read the golden light sutra and sanghata sutra and It says that you will basically never abandon the dharma or stray from the path once you’ve read it and I’ve recited mantras from Gelug sources at that which promise a last rebirth in the womb and no retrogression so I don’t think I will ever leave Buddhism explicitly though my understanding of it may be faulty due to human error and karma and imperfections .

So I need a buddhism that will accommodate by brahman view.I heard some kagyus and Jonangpa believe in this .should I follow them?

I’m not here to argue wether I’m wrong or right I just want to stay in buddhism and have a school wich can accommodate my seeming unshakeable view in a brahman.

Again I’m not here to argue for this view as it could be wrong I just am personally convinced that it’s true and I want to practice vajrayana so I wonder if any schools can accommodate my viewpoints?

Usually questions like this receive a lot of frustration but I’m trying my best to be Buddhist and this is just where I’m at at the moment.

I can't imagine Sanders putting together a cabinet like this. I'm saying this without judgement.

It looks like a thoroughly competent cabinet. If all goes well, the federal government will not be news for the next four years because they do their jobs without scandals.

I'm worried, though, that its not going to be enough to fend off another Republican scorched Earth assault on the country, especially if its some Trumpist in 2024.

Whatever else happens, Biden is going to have to make the lives of lower middle and working class voters palpably better. Its not going to be easy because the economy will be knee capped coming out of this winter - I don't think we've hit the wall yet. If the vaccine(s) works, recovery will be quick... I expect the Republicans to do what they can to sabotage the economy, though.

I see your point that competence is required at this time. I'm worried at the domestic Vandals running amok, though, at the same time.

The worst president in U.S. history and the worst Cabinet in U.S. history will soon be succeeded by Joe Biden and the promise of the best and most effective Cabinet in recent time.  Biden’s success will ultimately be determined by the political posture of Senator Mitch McConnell, but the initial appointments to his administration point to a strategy designed for political success.  The punditry class that dominates the mainstream media is wrong to suggest that his first nominees are insufficiently progressive or merely represent Obama 2.0.

The world has life to it, so why not meditate on the basis of Immortality?

And Jesus mentions, that for these who are willing to accept it, John the Baptist is the Elijah that is to come. Elijah has a very distinct personality and individuality, so Jesus was a great Teacher who understood reincarnation and He could obviously identify someone's reincarnation according to that part of the New Testament.

I found Origen's theology on this point interesting:

Unknown said:
So, we were first made as minds, and as minds we were made in the image of God, imago dei. And since, as the scriptures tell us, “God is a consuming fire” (Deut. 4:24, 9:3; Heb. 12:29), minds were made in the image of this fire. In fact, they were made to be like irons in the great fire of God: as long as they were plunged into the fire, they were aflame. But just like irons, when they were removed from God’s fire, they cooled and became evermore solid and slow. This cooling is our mythological descent into souls and bodies, the fall into flesh.

For Origen, all of this is by God’s design. Our fall into flesh is in fact our opportunity for rehabilitation. The original fiery mind moved quickly, too quickly, and so it was easily distracted. The descent into this world slows the mind down, now encumbered by a soul and a body, and trains it over many, many lifetimes to pay steadier attention. Whenever we successfully pay steady attention to anything, this or that, we inch closer to contemplation, and we blaze just a little brighter.

As for Samantha Power, you do understand how administrations work, right? She is a disciplined diplomat. As a employee of State, she cannot very well argue that the US should not support its allies in the region—we have treaties with them and treaties are law.

However, before Powers left State, she was criticizing the airwar in Yemen.

No, I disagree. Furthermore, people directly involved with it are being recruited by Biden (see Camp NAMA) and Obama of course opted NOT to prosecute the people who built and ran these black sites.

Delivering improvements in quality of life for the vast majority seems to me something that is beyond the control of the President. In many ways the US middle class is on a downward long-term trajectory that has multiple causes. Trump and many of his supporters seemed to believe that an isolated US with a return of manufacturing would help, but it appears in four years, hardly a dent was made in that direction. Meanwhile on the opposite side of the fence, it is believed by many that further globalization and engagement with the world at large is the road to prosperity.

Either way, the middle class keeps hollowing out and I am convinced it is not something a president can solve. It's a broader cultural, social, and economic shift.

He’ll spend four years cleaning up the mess left by Trump, and then hopefully he will spend the next four after that really setting this country on a correct path. Then after that hopefully it will be eight years of Harris. By then, maybe America will have driven its fascists back into the goddamn closet where they should have stayed to begin with.

The worst thing to happen now is for idiots on the left to think now is a good time for third parties. Let the right go down that rabbit hole,let’s encourage them to do so, in fact. But as a voting block, the left has to stick with the center.

Biden is inheriting another ruined economy from the GOP, just like Obama did, just like Clinton did, just like Carter did. The rest is not specifically directed at you Kirt.

[rant]

Americans are so dumb. They vote in the GOP cause "taxes," the GOP then cuts taxes, raises the deficit skyhigh, leaving economic ruin in their wake. The Democrats come in, fix it all, give the US a strong economy again, and then it starts all over again. Thank goodness there was only four years of Trump. 8 years would have been economic holocaust, not just carnage. I hope, but cannot be certain, that the GOP has ruined their brand for the next 20 years.

And all these people who bitch about neoliberalism—get a clue. As I said before, Isolationism is bad economics. Trump proved it; Hoover proved it, and the 19th century proved it. Granted, forcing austerity programs on countries does not work. It's also bad economics. But trade liberalization is a good thing, not a bad thing. What the Trump policies intended to do was to harm our trade allies for short terms gains; but in the end, we all would have lost.

Small government people need to wake up also—the only way to defend against corporate malfeasance is large government and strong regulation.

I really hope Biden strengthens and reinforces NATO and the UN. It is necessary, not just to bring Russia to heal, but also Poland and Hungary.

Trump ceded American soft power in the Pacific to China—that is a real problem for India as well Indonesia, Australia, we need to strengthen our presence there, both economically and militarily, just as Obama was doing toward the end of his administration.

We need to restore the continuity of diplomacy that was interrupted by Trump's diplomatic malfeasance. I am personally quite satisfied that Biden is placing Obama Admin veterans in his cabinet. They are competent and will restore the executive branch to proper working order. They know how shit is supposed to work.

America's reputation is badly damaged, but the route to salvaging that is not to promote some progressive dream team who likely cannot even get past the senate, but to put in place competent technocrats who are good at their jobs, who have served under multiple administrations.

So far, under the GOP we have had one paranoid vice president who led us into a war based on false intelligence (Cheney) and set the seed for undermining democracy in our country (Patriot Act), and a paranoid, malignant narcissist of a president who has nearly tore our democracy out from the root.

Therefore, the job before sane Americans is to make sure that GOP never returns to power in our lifetime. We've found out that there are 74 million people in this country, mostly racist white people, who willingly vote for fascists, because that is what the GOP party has become, a party of racists and fascists. That is pretty damn frightening. So wake up and stop dreaming about some other reality. [/rant]

Madhyamaka, no matter which variety one subscribes, is strictly based on intellectual analysis as well.

It is only Vajrayāna that the example/ultimate wisdom pointed out/realized at the time of empowerment takes precedence over intellectual analysis. When this is realized, it is called mahāmudra or dzogchen. When one is a Vajrayāna practitioner, it does not matter much which intellectual view one subscribes to, whether Madhyamaka or Yogacāra, since the view at the time of the empowerment experienced is a correct, experiential Madhyamaka view. By practicing Vajrayāna practices such as the two stages, and so on, one cultivates this experiential view for a long while, eventually leading its realization.

I'm reading through my wife's account so can't get a clean link... but here's the quote that made me yell STFU at my computer screen:
Sullivan, who supported the Obama administration’s TPP trade pact, has since acknowledged that Democrats overlooked the potentially negative consequences of such trade deals on American workers. Trump blamed both his 2016 opponent, Hillary Clinton, and Biden for destroying manufacturing jobs with the NAFTA trade deal.

In a September report, Sullivan underscored how trade deals can drive employers to pull out of U.S. communities and disrupt the livelihoods of people with few available alternatives. Democrats have frequently responded to this problem with federally funded economic-assistance programs, which Sullivan said were often “too little, too late.”
Like, this was what you realized now? What fetid echo chamber was this guy stewing in for the last generation? Bernie was talking about this since the 90s.

The more pertinent question is if Shentongpas take the works of Maitreya, Asanga, and Vasubandhu as their primary treatises or something else, because if yes, then they are rightly called Yogacarins.

Malcolm wrote:
Not necessarily: that depends on whether or not Dolbupa and co. correctly represent the thought of the Yogacārins. The usual strategy is to try and claim that while the Yogacarin treatises of Maitreya, Asanga and Vasubandhu are a species of Madhyamaka, there is a so-called an inferior cittamatra interpretation of the treatises of Maitreya. However, Karl Brunnhölzl points out, the presentation of Tibetan extrinsic emptiness proponents is quite at odds with what Asanga and Co. actually say.

Schrödinger’s Yidam said:
But it’s safe to say that what HHK meant—whatever that is—is more authoritative than Brunnhölzl.

Malcolm wrote:
Only if one accepts what religious hierarchs assert as true by mere fiat.

I do however agree with the Karmapa in this respect, and I have said it before: Maitreya wrote treatises covering three distinct trends in Mahāyāna Buddhism: Prajñāpāramita, Yogācāra, and Tathāgatagarbha.  However, it is pretty clear that in his synthesis of these three trends, the Ornament of Mahāyāna Sūtras, that the tathāgatagarbha doctrines takes a serious backseat, as it is mentioned but once, not only in his root text, but also in the commentary by Vasubandhu and Shtiramati.

Then there is the issue of whether the Uttaratantra was even written by Maitreya at all, and whether the commentary of Asanga was actually composed by him as well. And if it is the case that these texts were not written by Maitryea and Asanga (certainly the Chinese reception of these texts cast doubt on this), then the whole edifice the Extrinsic Emptiness proponents erect their arguments upon collapses because it is based on false authorial assumptions. I have already shown elsewhere that the convenient fiction of three turnings was of absolutely no interest to Indians writing on these subjects, and that there is no consensus about this idea among Tibetans.

The fact is that the Yogacarins also took the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras and the Madhyamaka of Nāgārjuna to be definitive—for example, Asanga receives no prediction in the Lanka, only Nāgārjuna—and merely faulted so-called mādhyamikas for being nihilistic. Indeed, one of their most famous scholars, Dharmapāla, wrote a commentary on Āryadeva's 400, not to fault Āryadeva, but to show that mādhyamikas (such as Buddhapalita and Bhavaviveka) were not understanding the father and son Madhyamaka correctly. And of course then we have the example of the 11th century paṇḍita and polymath, Ratnakāraśanti, whose Madhyamakālaṃkāra (referred to by Tibetans as the sems tsam rgyan) tries to reconcile Nagārjuna with Maitreya and Asanga. The colophon of this translation itself contains a rare, vituperative polemic aimed at followers of Candrakīrti.

I should also add, that Candrakīrti spends a fair amount of time trying to correct Yogacāra misunderstandings of their own terminology in such texts as the Introduction to Madhyamaka and its autocommentary.

Structurally and as an philosophical argument they are very similar.

Malcolm wrote:
That is the main point. Where they differ is in the posited result: one asserts a sort of intellectual recognition of the unity of all phenomena in an underlying ground; the other asserts merely that all sentient beings possess from the beginning the ultimate qualities of buddhahood, with for a moment suggesting there is some universal underlying ground at all. In this way, we can understand that while there are structural similarities between Advaita and Extrinsic Emptiness, the former is completely nonbuddhist, while the latter is a transitional school between Yogacāra and Madhyamaka in its attempt to reconcile the inner contradiction in the Yogacāra doctrine with Nāgārjuna's Madhyamaka.

https://buddhanature.tsadra.org/index.php/Questions Critics of the theory would say buddha-nature is the same as the self because buddha-nature teachings use positive language to describe an "essence" or an "innate characteristic" of a person. Some who accept buddha-nature argue that they are provisional teachings, that while they do seem to suggest a self, they nevertheless have practical value and, in any case, are not meant to be taken seriously—and there are scriptures to support this position. Others, however, disagree and hold to the buddha-nature teachings as a definitive teaching, and they maintain that in no way is buddha-nature a doctrine of a self. Those who advocate for this view teach that buddha-nature is not a matter of an individual essence; it is instead a universal reality—no one suggests that there are separate buddha-natures in each person. Individuals are subject to dependent origination—our existence comes about through causes and conditions and therefore cannot be said to be truly individually existent. But buddha-nature is not conditioned. It is simply a basic characteristic of having a mind and consciousness, and for this reason it cannot be said to belong to us as individuals. It is more like air—we all have it in our lungs, but it is not our own individual air.

Manjushri said:
As I mentioned in the first post, I'm at an early stage of exploring Tibetan Buddhism, therefore I cannot claim fluency and extensive knowledge on the subject, at all. Still, I think Sonam Thakchoe's book does a very good job at making the issue understandable to a degree for laymen's minds.

...

In a resumed way, for Tsongkhapa, enlightenment implies recognizing the validity of empirical truths, since the knowledge in which enlightenment is based requires empirical grounding, given their interrelated condition. Gorampa on the other hand refuses to accept it and proclaims that wisdom is only attained by getting rid altogether of the empirical truths and senses.

Malcolm wrote:
Part of the difference between the two is the tradition of tshad ma each master followed. Tsongkhapa followed the epistemological school of Sangphu founded by Phyapa with its complicated system of blo rigs; Gorampa followed Sapan, who rejected the former system in its entirety in his Treasury of Authority (tshad ma rigs gter). Sapan further asserted that Buddhist epistemology was of no value in liberation.

The fundamental difference between Tsongkhapa and Gorampa boils down to simple difference of opinion over whether or not one is to give precedence to the object of cognition or the cognition. Chandrakirti remarks that all dharmas bear two natures, one ultimate and one relative. He then goes on to say that relative truths are objects of mistaken cognitions; while ultimate truths are objects of veridical cognitions. The Gelukpas stress the former, that is the object; the Sakyapas stress the former, the cognition. When it comes to faithfulness to the Indian treatises, Gorampa wins hands down, IMO. The vast majority of Gorampa's arguments concern how Tsongkhapa is overriding, through reasonings, the plain intent of the Indian masters—indeed, at one point, Gorampa basically faults Tsongkhapa for over-finessing many points needlessly. But of course, it is just this finesse that Geluks celebrate in Tsongkhapa's writings.

I encourage you to study the Indian masters before getting wrapped up in Tibetan polemics about Madhyamaka. Then, once you have gained complete familiarity with the Indian masters, then return to the Tibetan masters and see with whom you agree.

Also, Thakchoe is a Gelukpa, his sentiments are plainly polemical and he does not really read Gorampa objectively. Gendun Chophel's presentation of Madhyamaka in Madman's Middle Way is far more objective.

Excuse my ignorance but isn't the word "alaya" part of the word "alaya vijnana" (i.e., "storehouse" and "storehouse-consciousness," respectively?) This suggests a grammatical relationship of modification rather than opposition, at least to my ignorant, braying common-sense-stunted way of reading.

After some frustrated googling I can't find anything suggesting the use of the word "alaya" in opposition to "alaya vijnana". Of course I am not a Yogacara scholar, much to my chagrin, so perhaps one of you could clear up for this yokel (me) how "x" and "x+y" are in a "versus" relationship.

No, Trump is gearing up to undermine the entire government by sowing doubt about the election with bald lies. He doesn't care about the courts unless they enable him. If they don't, his plan is to bypass them.

The dispute has been over how close observers can get to the canvassing proceedings, not whether observers are allowed to be present. Initially, a trial court denied the Trump campaign’s request for closer observation in Philadelphia, finding on Nov. 3 that by the campaign’s own admission, it had been given the opportunity to observe “the opening and sorting of ballots.”

The next day, a state court reversed that ruling, allowing observers within 6 feet, “while adhering to all COVID-19 protocols, including, wearing masks and maintaining social distancing.” Philadelphia’s election board then appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court, saying that it had complied with the law and that closer inspection “jeopardizes both the safety of the City Defendants’ canvass, plus the privacy of voters.”

The obvious types of American fascists are dealt with on the air and in the press. These demagogues and stooges are fronts for others. Dangerous as these people may be, they are not so significant as thousands of other people who have never been mentioned. The really dangerous American fascists are not those who are hooked up directly or indirectly with the Axis. The FBI has its finger on those. The dangerous American fascist is the man who wants to do in the United States in an American way what Hitler did in Germany in a Prussian way. The American fascist would prefer not to use violence. His method is to poison the channels of public information. With a fascist the problem is never how best to present the truth to the public but how best to use the news to deceive the public into giving the fascist and his group more money or more power.

If we define an American fascist as one who in case of conflict puts money and power ahead of human beings, then there are undoubtedly several million fascists in the United States. There are probably several hundred thousand if we narrow the definition to

include only those who in their search for money and power are ruthless and deceitful. Most American fascists are enthusiastically supporting the war effort. They are doing this even in those cases where they hope to have profitable connections with German chemical firms after the war ends. They are patriotic in time of war because it is to their interest to be so, but in time of peace they follow power and the dollar wherever they may lead.

American fascism will not be really dangerous until there is a purposeful coalition among the cartelists, the deliberate poisoners of public information, and those who stand for the K.K.K. type of demagoguery.

The idea of God is an absolutely necessary psychological function of an irrational nature, which has nothing whatever to do with the question of God's existence. The human intellect can never answer this question, still less give any proof of God. Moreover such proof is superfluous, for the idea of an all-powerful divine Being is present everywhere, unconsciously if not consciously, because it is an archetype. There is in the psyche some superior power, and if it is not consciously a god, it is the "belly" at least, in St Paul's words. I therefore consider it wiser to acknowledge the idea of God consciously; for, if we do not, something else is made God, usually something quite inappropriate and stupid such as only an "enlightened" intellect could hatch forth.

That's on a personal level.

Social media has weaponized a kind of corrosive idiocy that used to be confined to late night talk radio....what little capability existed for critical thought before, the landscape of today so discourages it, it's so much easier for people to go to some really dark places.
Losing this election will hopefully snap the ones who can be saved out of their derangement. The rest, the whackos, will eventually go back to living in their parents' basement, and then we can return to our regular eruptions of mass violence like isotopes shooting out of decaying uranium. Notice we haven't had any for a while? The psychos are tuned into the show. But its just time before they start sublimating that antisocial brain damage against fellow human beings again.

Some years back a US colleague from Maine told me how after school he went for one of those long road trips across the country which shattered his stereotypes of those "flyover country" places.

It seems that we get ever more locked into our echo-chambers, increasingly resistant to voices that sound different. Maybe this is something to look at rather than the incredible diversity we share?

An interesting practice I've found has been to deliberately go and interact with people who have very different views to mine. I spent some time with Patriot Prayer folks on their FB page, as Malcolm knows. Some of my old friends hold very strong opinions on issues and I regularly walk away from discussions with them online, because they start to get personal. Long way from mastering this! But I guess learning to see diversity, a different view as something fascinating rather than threatening, a different way of seeing things that can expand out horizons, has something going for it, IMO.

Take a typical French Swiss urbanite from Geneva and put her together with a typical Swiss German speaking Protestant church-going farmer from the Canton of Glarus. In terms of their outlooks, views and day-to-day life, habits, food, they might as well be from different planets, or at least different centuries. And apart from that, they don't even speak a language in common. Yet, they vote in the same elections and manage not to hate each other.

He says he is  a Gelugpa, but does not appear to think much of their praxis..otherwise one assumes he'd be seeking authorization and teaching that.

The reviews read like he is essentially doing counseling with people from a Buddhist point of view. I think there is actually a real place for this, but it is not the same thing as being a Dharma teacher at all.

I don't wish to prejudge him, so I freely admit I may be wrong, but to me there are some serious red flags here that make it worth being very critical about his writings.

The issue here is that gzhan stong pas divide Madhyamaka up into two divisions, those who assert or try to prove intrinsic emptiness, that is that all entities of whatever kind are rang stong, intrinsically empty, including buddhahood and its various attributes, ultimate truth, and so on. This position that they attribute to their opponents is described as "rang stong."

The gzhan stong position, extrinsic emptiness, is that while it is perfectly fine to assert that relative truth is intrinsically empty, they maintain it is incorrect to assert that ultimate truth is intrinsically empty, claiming ultimate truth is merely empty of relative truth. The substance of their claim depends on applying the three natures of the Yogacāra school to the two truths of Madhyamaka, positing that the imagined and dependent natures belong to relative truth, and the perfected nature belongs to ultimate truth, and that the perfected nature is empty of the imagined and dependent nature. Some of them (mainly the Jonang pas) further claim that tathāgatagarbha is this perfected nature, and that therefore, ultimate buddha qualities exist inherently in sentient beings in a fully developed form (the flaw in that argument is the consequence that the ultimate will have parts).

The whole debate goes back to a dispute between Indian Mahāyānists over whether the ultimate is a so-called affirming or a nonaffirming negation.

Classical Tibetan Madhyamaka itself has its own set of controversies, of course, such as the 12th century distinction between svatantrika and prasangika positions, and so on.

But all of these trends refer to themselves as Madhyamaka and they all proclaim their view is the highest.

Various  Dzogchen/Mahamudra masters suggest Sukhavati practice, phowa, etc., so the argument about no tantra because of missing sexual organs sounds weird, and has not really been supported so far. Also, as far as I know, it is not mentioned that beings in Sukhavati do not have sexual organs, just that there are no females, other than offering devis (again the devis part is from Karma Chagme's aspiration). If anything, since sexual organs are one of the marks of a Buddha, and beings in Sukhavati have different marks (or maybe develop them over time?), the reasonable thing is that they have sexual organs.

However, this quote by Machig Labdron sounds a bit extreme, that it is not actually possible in practice to go to any other field for humans. It would be good to have a specific text name.

But even here, the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa chapter on buddhafields both establishes this point and that also the Sahāloka is actually a pure buddhafield generated out of the aspiration of the Bodhisattva:

The Buddha said, “Śāriputra, this buddhafield is always thus pure, but the Tathāgata makes it appear to be spoiled by many faults, in order to bring about the maturity of inferior living beings. For example, Śāriputra, the gods of the Trayastriṃśa heaven all take their food from a single precious vessel, yet the nectar that nourishes each one differs according to the differences of the merits each has accumulated. Just so, Śāriputra, living beings born in the same buddhafield see the splendor of the virtues of the buddhafields of the buddhas according to their own degrees of purity.”

The reason why this reading is preferable to simply having a mind of faith, "dad mos kyi sems" is that one must be clear minded at the time of death in order to have this experience, otherwise, arguably, the sūtra would had prāsadacitta.

The Japanese Buddhist scholars have merely adopted a paradigm of western knowledge accumulation from the Germans, which was used originally for evaluating the Bible. This does not make it any less racist if one asserts it is the summum bonum of knowledge accumulation.

Are you asserting then that the Sahāloka is nondual with the dharmakāya? If so, then all the benefits of Sukhavati should apply in the Sahāloka, because if you assert that Amitabha is the dharmakāya, then you must assert all buddhas are the dharmakāya, and therefore all buddhafields of all buddhas are nondual with the dharmakāya, whether they are so called pure or impure buddhafields.

Thus, the only reason there is a difference between the Sahāloka and Sukhāvati is that the aspirations of Śākyamuni and Amitabha while on the path were different, accounting for differences in their respective buddhafields. The same applies to Amoghasiddhi's buddhafield, Bhaisajyaguru's buddhafield and so on. This means these nirmāṇakāya buddhafields are only compounded phenomena, not uncompounded.

Malcolm wrote:
It's a matter of identity and difference at the same time, depending upon one's level of awakening. All Buddhas emerge from dharmakāya. The benefits of Sukhāvatī are a result of the dharmakāya as compassionate means and not the dharmakāya as suchness are compounded, so they don't apply in the Sahāloka.
This does not make any sense. The Sahāloka is Śākyamuni's buddhafield, so according to your terminology, it is also a result of the dharmakāya as compassionate means. On the other hand, the dharmakāya is knowledge, not a creative force. When we say the rūpakāya emerges from the dharmakāya, this is not mean literally on the sense of a seed emerging from a sprout. You've already agreed that the cause of the rūpakāya is merit.

The question is not the limitations of the dharmakāya, the question is the limitations of the nirmāṇakāya, since the latter appears in various realms to various beings in those realms as a result of their karma, unlike the dharmakāya, which does not appear to sentient beings at all, not even bodhisattvas on the tenth bhumi.

Malcolm wrote:
I am not disputing this. Essentially we are largely in agreement about everything but you are not realising it, probably because I am using terminology that is sect specific. The same thing happens to me when I hear people from Tibetan Buddhism.
This happens all the time.

There are levels of irreversibility on each path. For example, someone on the path of accumulation reaches a state of irreversible generation of bodhicitta; someone on the path of application reaches a state of patience where they can no longer fall into lower realms, etc. It is quite impossible for beings to attain the eighth bodhisattva stage merely through birth in Sukhāvati. There is no justification in the sūtra for this position whatsoever. This also ignores the presence of srāvakas of various levels of attainment in Sukhāvati, bodhisattvas of inferior merit, and so on. There is also no statement in any Sukhāvati sūtra or its like which guarantees that one will be born as a eighth stage bodhisattva. Instread, it is due to the incredibly long lifespans of beings there that they are assured that they have only one lifetime before attaining buddhahood, and not because of any guarantee of immediate realization.

Malcolm wrote:
This is an interpretation, as is my assertion of the 8th bhūmi. But I would say you are right that not all bodhisattvas there are at a certain bhūmi immediately.
Then my assertion is not merely an interpretation, but is based in scripture and founded on reason, and also includes the fact that Buddha Amitabha is also Buddha Amitayus. Further, the details of the paths and stages are laid out very precisely by Asanga and so on.


Unknown said:
The upaya card is must stand up to scripture and it must stand up to reason, otherwise one can say anything about any text that one likes. Your assertion does not stand up to scripture, since the eighteenth aspiration makes no mention whatsoever of these three minds, and further excludes those who have committed the five deeds of immediate retribution from birth in Sukhāvati, so not only does this assertion not stand up to scriptural analysis, it also does stand up to reason since if it were the case, there would be no arhats or bodhisattvas of inferior merit in Sukhāvati, unless of course you argue that they lack these three minds. But the eighteenth aspiration guarantees only that apart from those who commit the five deeds of immediate retribution, those who hear the name of Amitabha and have trust in him are granted a vision of Amitabha at death.

Malcolm wrote:
1. The three minds are underlined here,
(18) If, when I attain Buddhahood, the sentient beings of the ten quarters who, with sincere and entrusting heart, aspire to be born in my land and say my name even ten times, should not be born there, may I not attain the perfect enlightenment. Excluded are those who commit the five grave offenses and those who slander the right Dharma.
I.e. sincere mind, entrusting mind, and aspiring mind.

2. Not all who attain birth do so through the 18th vow. Also, the 18th vow does not produce birth due to merit.

3. Vision of Amitābha at death is not assured by the 18th vow.
This again is not certain, the term you've translated as heart is simply "citta," mind, "mama nāmadheyaṃ śrutvā prasannacittā māmanusmareyuḥ;" the adjective for citta is "prasanna," and it simply means "clear," so there are not three things here, but only two, "1) remembers me 2) with a clear mind."  Since there are only two things here, being lucid at the time of death and Buddhanusmṛti, recollection of the Buddha, arguably this is even easier than the requirement to have Shinjin. It still does not guarantee anything about realization. The word "sincere" and "entrusting" are nowhere to be found in the Sanskrit, or the Tibetan, for that matter.

Furthermore, it is not birth in that land to which they aspire, it is "ye sattvā anyeṣu lokadhātuṣvanuttarāyāṃ samyaksaṃbodhau cittamutpādya," is "Any sentient beings who generates the intent to unsurpassed full awakening in that lokadhātu, who hears/says my name, and remembers me with a clear mind , etc...." But there is no mention of ten times. "Say" rather than "hear", is Shinran's revision, however, there is an argument that can be made that śruta can be understood both ways, however the Chinese, if I recall, clearly has "hear," as Gomez confirms. Also in Gomez's translation of the Sangavarman recension, there is no ten times, this is a Shin addition to the text. So the intent here is that one must generate bodhicitta, aspirational bodhicitta, to attain unsurpassed full awakening in Sukhāvati. And if one has generated such bodhicitta, heard the name of Amitabha, and at the time of death has a clear mind and remembers him, these are the four conditions that will result in a vision of Amitabha and his retinue at the time of death.

Unknown said:
There are too many different directions this is going in, but the exclusion of those who commit the five grave offenses is also an upāya—since they are allowed birth if they have the three minds as per the Contemplation Sūtra. The point however for now is not in the details, it is that certain things are meant to encourage and not be definitive statements.

Malcolm wrote:
The devil is always in the details, this is why these conversations happen between schools. One's schools "skillful means" is a wrong view according to another school.But since you brought up certain points, it is important to demonstrate where there are variances between schools that ostensibly both belong to Mahāyāna.

Unknown said:
This does not mean they were accurately translated. In fact, in this early period, when Saṃghavarman was working, the third century CE, translation into Chinese was still in its infancy. Given that we have a Sanskrit version that the Tibetan reflects very well, it casts doubt on the accuracy of the Samghavarman's translation on this point. We would need to compare it with later translations of the same text to see if there is a correspondence with other recensions of the text.

Malcolm wrote:
I'd argue that his translations are pretty comprehensible compared to other translators. Something like the passage we are referring to is unlikely to have issues, whereas matters of basic terminology do end up being problematic. Since entire sections are present or missing in different versions, it is clearly less a translation issue and more of a recension issue.
There are a number of issues both in Samghavarmin's translations, and even more in the way Shinran has recast portions of Samghavarmin's translation to fit with his approach to Nembutsu.

Holding up western historiography as the pinnacle of human intellectual culture is basically racist.

Astus said:
From Jeff Shore, a Rinzai Zen teacher and a professor at Hanazono University:

'Why, and from where, did the lineage-transmission legend arise? As Zen begins to take root in the West many Zennists naturally are attracted to this myth; some even naively believe it is literally true. They think that obtaining accouterment associated with lineage transmission somehow proves their Zen is authentic. Perhaps it just reflects a fundamental lack of awakening. A brief review of the historical development of the lineage-transmission legend will dispel some of the preposterous misconceptions surrounding it. 
In the early Tang dynasty, a good 1,300 years ago, not just Zen, but other Buddhist schools were under pressure to at least prove their legitimacy, at best gain position and prestige from the vying political powers. The Chinese T’ien-t’ai [Jp.: Tendai ] school was active in this before the nascent “Ch’an” or Zen school was. In spite of the “Separate transmission apart from scripture, Not depending on words and letters” rhetoric, as already mentioned, the “Zen school” had relied on sutras — The Lankavatara Sutra in the transmission from Bodhidharma to the second patriarch, and later The Diamond Sutra. But by the eighth century attempts were made to trace back directly to Shakamuni through a spiritual lineage-transmission.
In short, various “Zen groups” then created a number of conflicting lineage transmission charts to try and gain legitimacy. These lineage charts were based on imperial cult lineage and modified Confucian ancestor worship. A “Buddha-family Line” was created to try and show that the present possessor was a direct spiritual descendent of Shakamuni. By tracing oneself back directly to Shakamuni rather than just to statements in a sutra, one could come out superior to the other Buddhist schools, and to other “illegitimate” lineages within the Zen school. Just as the emperor was the ruler over this world, the Zen patriarch was to be considered the ruler over the spiritual realm.
What we now naively view as “genuine” transmission-lineages in Zen Buddhism are largely dependent on vagaries of history and social-political plays for power. The pivotal figure is Kataku Jinne [Ho-tsê Shên-hui 670-762]. In an attempt to make himself the seventh patriarch, Jinne mounted an attack on the so-called “northern school” of Zen and argued forcefully for the legitimacy of his “southern school.” Using the obscurity of his teacher, now universally known as “the sixth patriarch,” to advantage, he based his attack on a strict patriarchal succession that he created, based on imperial cult lineage. Although the actual teachings of the two schools were virtually the same, Jinne denounced the teachings of the northern school. One of the reasons for his success was that he raised a huge amount of money — for military purposes — by selling a great number of ordination certificates in state-sponsored ceremonies.'
( The Source of Zen: Who Transmits What? )

Malcolm wrote:
The above argument is extremely silly and barely tenuous. The notion of lineages was carried from India to Tibet, China, and Central Asia by subcontinental Buddhists, principally by Vajrayana practitioners such as Amoghavajra, but also monastic abbots. Everyone seems to forget that in 845, a Taoist empower destroyed 200,000 Buddhist temples, and sent up millions of texts in flames. Relying on the sparsity of Dunhuang to prove anything definitive about Buddhist history in China shows a paucity of reason and is at best specious. A better argument for the survival of the southern school is that it was in the southern hinterlands and so escaped suppression.

Astus said:
It is based on documents available from various eras, many of them from the Dunhuang caves, that show how the list of Indian patriarchs developed to its current form through a century of changes, and there are also the developments of the first six patriarchs of China, and how eventually Huineng was accepted as the sixth. Just that is already enough to show how the very basis of an unbroken lineage from the Buddha is fictional.

The benefit of knowing past lives is repentance. Though it is unlikely we will know our past lives in this life, knowing our past deeds even from this life is important in developing the mind that aspires to birth:
Longer Sūtra said:
“If these sentient beings become aware of their past offenses and deeply repent with a desire to leave that place, then immediately as they wish, they will be able to go to the place of the Buddha of Immeasurable Life, where they can worship and make offerings to the Buddha. In addition, they will be able to visit all the other countless and innumerable Buddhas and cultivate various meritorious acts.

Zhen Li said:
Ajataśātru is an example of this. If you repent deeply from the deeds of this life, how much more so will you progress if you know of your negative deeds from countless prior lives? True knowledge of the evils of saṃsāra would require knowledge of past lives, so it is crucial for attaining Buddhahood to know more than one life.

Indeed, you can know your past lives by being born in the Amitābha's Pure Land, according to the fifth vow:
Longer Sūtra said:
(5) If, when I attain Buddhahood, the humans and devas in my land should not remember all their former lives, and thus be unable to know at least the events of the previous hundred thousand kotis of nayutas of kalpas, may I not attain the perfect enlightenment.

You can just look at the world of textual criticism of this sort ("Early Buddhism" is one of the best examples) to see that it quickly becomes a treasure hunt of sorts, and rarely brings people to actually practicing. To me, that is evidence enough that this approach is one that is only peripherally valuable to Dharma practice. Peripheral value like that has it's place, but once it becomes central it ceases to be Dharma practice.

Although there has been a significant growth of studies during the last few decades that showed how most of the important elements of Chan/Zen self-presentation as a "special transmission" is fabricated (and worse, fabricated with ill intentions), I have not seen anyone trying to answer that challenge, but rather things seem to continue as if such academic works did not exist at all. Although it might be that some in Japanese/Korean/Chinese academics try to work out a response. Not that it's anything new, after all, attacking the validity of the lineage was the tactics of both Tiantai and the various Chan factions.

Astus said:
There is a shared field in the accounts of past events, where the traditional story says one thing, and historical documents say another, like in the case of Moheyan. Furthermore, the very concept that one relies on a tradition - i.e. something transmitted to the present through past generations - invokes the assumption of validation through history. Only when authenticity is independent of the reliability of one's perception of history could it be said that verification of past events is irrelevant. Such freedom from historical constrains is said to be the quality of the Dharma, that it is readily visible (saṃdṛṣṭika) and timeless (akālika). The words of the Buddha are necessarily from the past transmitted to the present, therefore not free from historical circumstances, but the meaning delivered through them is immaterial, so while it is the meaning that matters more, it cannot be wholly removed from the words themselves.

Malcolm wrote:
If you wish to measure the validity of your practice through the erasures necessitated by adopting a settler colonialist perspective on Buddhist history, go ahead. But I think you will find that such histories are mainly concerned with coercion and the assertion of dominance and power over their subjects, and not really "facts." The very way you posed the question shows this, "but at least some level of recognition of the need to be able to communicate Buddhism on the highest levels of human intellectual culture of our times would be beneficial."
