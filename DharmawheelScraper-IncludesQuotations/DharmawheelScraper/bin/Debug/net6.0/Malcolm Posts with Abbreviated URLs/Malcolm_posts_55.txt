I am a tiny bit uncomfortable here with the word "consciousness" out of the fear of introducing subcategories such as "subconscious" or "unconscious." Honestly, the other poster is correct in prefering "awareness" to "consciousness" because all the Dzogchen literature and texts that I have seen use "awareness," specifically "Intrinsic Awareness." The word "intrinsic" signifies that awareness is intrinsic to mind; that is, awareness is the nature of mind.

Malcolm wrote:
This is because of the allergy people have to the word "consciousness", it is not a justifiable translation based on the term "consciousness" by itself.

There are a range of words in Tibetan that use the particle "shes pa" such as rnam shes, ye shes, shes rab, shes pa itself, and so on. They all refer to modes of consciousness. Rig pa refers to what that consciousness knows. Pristine consciousness [ ye shes ] is one thing, our ordinary state of consciousness [ rnam shes ] something else — but they both have the same basis, shes pa.

Dzogchen terminology for these things is a very sophisticated psychology of delusion and liberation, but unfortunately, it has been obscured by translations that are not precise and clear.

Again, so far as I can tell though there's nothing saying the Chinese noticed a significant (or any) Buddhist presence in Tibet in the Yarlung period. Later medieval historians can say what they want about this period, but questions will remain. Compare that with the Chinese accounts of places like Kucha, Khotan, Samarkand, Koguryo, Japan and SE Asian nations where popular devotion to Buddhism is noted.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, China is not the navel of the world.

Your argument runs as follows, "The Chinese did write about it, therefore it did not exist."

Tibet was of interest to China solely because Tibetans threatened their interests on the Silk Road. Other than that, China had no interest in the Tibetans, this, more than anything else, explains the lack of mention of Tibetan in Chinese annals.

This is not the case with "Khotan, Samarkand, Koguryo, Japan and SE Asian nations..." where China had active trade interests.

As for Tibetan Ministers, well, they were soldiers; and even in the time of the 5th Dalai Lama, there were certain kinds of animal sacrifices done in Lhasa. This does not mean that the population as a whole were not interested in Dharma.

In the case of Tibet, I've looked at the Tang Chinese account of it in two fascicles (fairly lengthy, which highlights how important Tibet was to the Tang history). It is interesting, for example, that it doesn't seem to mention Buddhism. There were plenty of envoys going to Tibet from China, but there's no real mention of a Buddhist institution in Yarlung Tibet. They mention a lot of blood sacrifices being done to seal oaths. So, how does that fit with the traditional Tibet narratives (especially later on when Yarlung kings are retroactively made Buddhist kings)? The legends have their place in cultural memory, but historians need to be critical and objective.

Malcolm wrote:

One of the things Jackson has said is that at some point of history, thogal was taught right from the start to students before the presently used systems were developed. Maybe it was before 15th century or something like that. Me not being a specialist of the Tibetan tradition I don't know in detail what these methods refer to but I guess like preliminary practices/ngondro and deity/tantric practices. He also said that there is one lineage of dzogchen, Palyul, who never did this and who still teach thogal first.

Malcolm wrote:
What they teach in Palyul is separation of samsara and nirvana which is the preliminary for thogal; actual thogal is reserved for post tregcho teachings.

zenman said:
I keep hearing this abuse-thing (underline). I have learned about the thogal-practices, space gazing and sky gazing, from texts provided by Jackson, and have tried them out. I never experienced such clarity during many years of zen training with top masters of the world. I suppose these two practices are the most central ones in thogal. Are they? They have been described also in several books, like one by Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche and Lopon Tenzin Namdak. I don't see any reason why gazing could not be taught to anyone and tried, or how this could become a problem or create obstacles. However I think it requires calmness (shamatta).

There are still a few really qualified teachers of Dzogchen around such as Chogyal Namkhai Norbu. Why waste your time with anything less? I know Jax's point of view very well — he constantly criticizes Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, he does not like Song of the Vajra, Vajra dance as well as the secondary practices that ChNN communicates, etc. This merely demonstrates something about Jax and nothing at all about ChNN's teachings.

Anyone can write a nice book about Dzogchen — its words are very easy to understand and fun to repeat. But there is a difference between a Dzogchen master like Chogyal Namkhai Norbu and someone like Jax. You can observe this in their conduct and activity. CHNN never expresses anything but respect for his own teachers and others. Jax puts himself on a pedestal and likes to criticize people who he has taken teachings from without cause. This speaks volumes.

That's quite plausible, but what did 'king' mean in the sixth or even fifth century? It might refer to the people who were Tibetans' ancestors and not much else.

The same problem is actually present in the history of Japan: early written sources are clearly written long after the fact and by a centralized government-court needing to legitimize itself and its leadership in the face of a longstanding aristocracy with competing interests. Although there actually lived the emperors specified in the histories, they were effectively local chieftains when they lived and much of what later became recognized as 'Japan' did not have anything to do with them.

Yes, the Tibetan script is based on a Sanskrit script. There were many Sanskrit scripts. The earliest two were Kharoshthi and Brahmi:

Malcolm wrote:
The Bonpos assert that Tibetan script is derived from Zhang zhung smar script, from around 100 BCE. Given that Tibetans engaged on one of the most amazing cultural self-immolations during the 9th century, and given considerable evidence that Tibetans were familiar with writing prior the 7th century based on their being a vassal state of Zhang Zhung, disregarding for a moment the origin of Zhang Zhung smar script, the Tibetans certainly knew what writing was at a very early date.

The idea that Thonmi Sambhota "invented" Tibetan writing is an error. He adapted an earlier system based on his exposure to Sanskrit. It is likely therefore that while in general Bhrami must have formed the basis for all scripts in Zhang Zhung and Tibet, it is very hasty to claim that writing did not exist in Tibet prior to the 7th century, especially given the clear accounts of the books of Bonpos being burned by Buddhists during the late eighth century from both sides.

You very carefully did not answer my question. So let's try this again.

So are you saying that an affliction, such as anger, can be indulged/acted upon on the level of affliction and call it Vajrayana?
It has to be experienced in order to be addressed. It has to be allowed to arise, be seen and recognized.
Right. And if at that point it is not transmuted into enlightened wisdom, and remains an affliction, is that Vajrayana practice or is that samsaric activity?

Malcolm wrote:
You are really missing the point. When you observe anger arise in your mind, as a Vajrayāna practitioner, this is understood to be wisdom. It is not "turned" into wisdom, it always was. Such afflictions are poison because they are not recognized — when they are recognized, they have no power, and therefore, one does not act in ways that produce karma. This Vajrayāna method is very indirect, because it requires a lot of conceptual effort, but in principle it is the same as the the idea of liberation through recognition in Dzogchen.

For example, you become angry, but if you are a Vajrayāna practitioner, you cannot be angry at your own mandala, so when you apply the practice "all appearances are the deity" this cuts the force of anger.

smcj said:
If you are an advanced practitioner and are capable of transmuting an affliction into wisdom--which is an extraordinary accomplishment--then you can get near the affliction. Once transmuted it is no longer a poison, but now a medicine, an expression of the enlightened mind. But in either scenario the affliction is never simply indulged in as an affliction per se. That is Vajrayana 101.

Malcolm wrote:
No. All appearances are the deity. All sounds are mantra. All thoughts are wisdom. This is Vajrayana 101.

The path of transformation means that you do not reject things that cause afflictions to arise; you utilize those things and through the practice of creation stage, transform them. For example, the yoga eating food, the yoga of sleep, washing and so on.

Malcolm wrote:
ye shes = pristine [ye] consciousness [shes].

Wisdom, in English, does not really accurately translate ye shes. In English, wisdom means sagacity, intelligence, sense, common sense, shrewdness, astuteness, smartness, judiciousness, judgment, prudence, circumspection; logic, rationale, rationality, soundness, advisability. ANTONYMS folly, stupidity. as well as knowledge, learning, erudition, sophistication, scholarship, philosophy; lore.

Consciousness means the state of being awake and aware of one's surroundings, the awareness or perception of something by a person; the fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world: consciousness emerges from the operations of the brain.

Now, there is in English no word that genuinely captures the sense of the term ye shes. And the sense of ye shes has gone beyond the Sanskrit term jñāna, at least in Dzogchen texts.

Ye shes is not inert, it is conscious; but it is not a conceptual or dualistic consciousness, it is therefore pristine.

Someone who is confused about this, and has been confused about it for a long time, and has trotted his confusion out as though it's a pedigree in the public square, is rather clearly not an authentic teacher.


Malcolm wrote:
The problem here is mostly around definitions.

What is meant by "mind"? What is meant by "awareness?" What is meant by "wisdom."

One can certainly find many Dzogchen texts that assert mind and wisdom are mutually exclusive. For example, one of the texts in the Pellucid Transcendent State of Samantabhadra cycle declares:
The general dharma systems assert buddhahood for the mind. The system of the Pellucid Transcendent State of the Great Perfection does not assert buddhahood in the mind. The mind is the basis of accumulating various traces. Buddhahood is self-originate pristine consciousness [rang byung ye shes] that is free from thought. There is no place for traces to accumulate in the pristine consciousness that is free from thought.
It then cites a text called Molten Silver:
Observe the mind with the mind, there isn’t anything to see;
likewise, even though the nature of the mind is understood to be empty, this is not buddhahood;
that removes afflictions, but does not increase wisdom.
Hoping for buddhahood in the mind is like a feather being carried by the wind.
It finally distinguishes that mind and pristine consciousness [ ye shes ] have different results:
The results are not the same: the mind is mounted on the vāyu, and the mental concepts of the merged vāyu and mind move wildly. An undercurrent of concepts arise, accumulating as an undercurrent of traces. The present cause of birth in samsara is always engaging in the dualism of an apprehended object and an apprehending subject through combining both mind and the breath. Since one possesses a mind of an apprehended object and an apprehending subject, concepts arise in the mind. Since various concepts proliferate, temporary concepts arose. Since the five poisonous afflictions arose in the mind, they increased to eighty-four thousand. Since concepts proliferate in the mind, in every instant of time, one hundred concepts arise and on hundred cease. Therefore, the wheel of suffering is uninterrupted. The result is the ripening of the three lower realms.

Pristine consciousness self-originates from the beginning, is without breath, is pellucid, free from the mind, limpidly clear, non-conceptual and completely blissful. Since it is without arising and ceasing, it does not move. Clear in uniformity, unchanging and uninterrupted, clarity and non-conceptuality, bliss and emptiness are the same. The result is self-appearing perfect buddhahood.
So, one needs to be careful.

Now that you mention these, I recall reading about them, but I am curious as to whether most Tibetan masters in history were aware of the direct correspondence between the violence described in Vajrayāna texts and the real life violence between Brahmanical and Buddhist societies.

Oh, absolutely, it is major theme in all lineages histories of the siddhas.

The explanation of the symbolic import of abhicarya rites and so on was confined to mundane practitioners who had not achieved siddhi.
So that leads to the question: how many people were aware of the non-symbolic import of abhicāra rites?

Malcolm wrote:
Pretty much everyone in Tibet, including common people. I mean look, just examine the bio of Milarepa — what was he famous for? Rites for summoning hail connected with the planetary god, Rahula. Everyone in Tibet knows this, it is part of the common culture.

Wrathful rituals to dispatch demons as well as enemies are part and parcel of Tibetan religious life. There was a whole class of ritualists called Sogdogpas whose main job was ritually repelling Mongolians.

Rites known as Zor, which translates to something in modern parlance like "magical bomb," but literally means "sickle" or "scythe", are very popular. They are popular because people believe they work.

There is for example in Gelug history, the example of using abhicara rites to kill one of the Karmapas before he had a chance to reach the Chinese emperor.  A famed Gelug master was concerned that if the Karmapa as allowed to reach the Qing emperor,, things would be bad for the fortune of the Gelug school. 

There is much less erotica in Tibetan Vajrayāna than its Indian forbear, because the Tibetans were rather prudish, but have a rather violent character and are pretty war-like. They have just sublimated most of their aggression into religious and business pursuits, and they are self-consciously aware of this to a high degree.

Yes, there is the rnam thar of Virupa, which while committed to writing in the late 12th century, certainly was communicated orally from the mid 11th. There is the songs of Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen which make fun of going to pilgrimage to Bodhgaya since a) it is controlled by Hindus, and b) one is likely to be murdered by hostile hill tribes on the way.

Also the 12th century bio of Padmasambhava reports a great deal of hostility between Hindus and Buddhists, and the stories of the 84 mahāsiddhas are full of magical battles between Hindus and Buddhists. There is even the 13th century confrontation between Harananda and Sakya Pandita. In short, Tibetans knew very well that India was a hostile place for Buddhists, which is why they largely ceased going there for anything other than trade purposes by the 13th century. They also received regular reports of Hindu hostilities from refugee Indian Buddhists who frequently took refuge in Tibet as late as the 15th century.

Generally these accounts — dating from the 11th through 13th century — portray Buddhism as being under siege by wicked Hindu Kings, with accounts of violence, sorcery and contests.

The explanation of the symbolic import of abhicarya rites and so on was confined to mundane practitioners who had not achieved siddhi.

Verardi's argument is that the symbolism of violence in the tantric materials is not strictly symbolic: it actually reflects real life violence as a reaction to centuries of antagonistic and hostile Brahmanism. It seems when the Tibetans inherited these practices, the historical background and context behind them were not really understood, which is also why modern teachers likewise would interpret things as being entirely symbolic.

Malcolm wrote:

However, the criteria for being able to engage of rites of liberation on more than a symbolic level requires that the practitioner be a siddhi in fact. You should examine the story of Virupa, as his tale has the largest number of hostile and violent interactions with Hindus.

From another thread. Garching R. weighs in on the definition of "non-dual".

Garchin R. said:
Those who understand the view of non-duality, that self and others are not separate, can practice the Dharmakaya Phowa. The Dharmakaya Phowa is very powerful. Those who do not understand the non-duality of self and others should practice the Phowa of compassion - the Samboghakaya and Nirmanakaya Phowa. So those who perceive a duality of self and others, who think that we are separate from each other, should practice the Samboghakaya or Nirmanakaya Phowa - the Phowa of compassion. Those who understand that a duality of self and others does not exist within the mind, can practice the Dharmakaya Phowa. Because they have given rise to compassion, they have love; and because they have realized emptiness, they know that a duality of self and others does not exist. Therefore, they are able to destroy the self-grasping in the minds of others. This is the supreme Phowa

smcj said:
(formatting mine)

How does that square with Madhyamaka?

Malcolm wrote:
In Madhyamaka, ultimately there is no duality because neither existence nor nonexistence, self and other, etc. is established in the ultimate.

However, the final statement, "they are able to destroy the self-grasping in the minds of others"  is not consistent with the premise, "because they have realized emptiness, they know that a duality of self and others does not exist."

Further, there is the added problem — Buddhas have realized everything to realize, and have abandoned everything to abandon, they have perfect compassion which is unlimited. For what reason then have they not destroyed self-grasping that exists in the mind of all sentient beings? Therefore, I don't think that this statement above can be taken seriously. It also contradicts the statement of the Buddha:
Misdeeds cannot be washed away by water,
the suffering of living beings cannot be removed with the hand,
my realization cannot transferred to another,
but by showing the true nature of things, there will be liberation.

Serreze does have some criticism for the paper. This study shows that “sea ice thickness, like extent, is highly variable,” he says. “Now, we’ve already known that it’s highly variable … So it’s really not saying anything new there.” He also has some concerns about the basic methods the researchers used to compute changes in sea ice volume, arguing that they made some “suspect assumptions” about certain important factors that could affect their calculations, like the thickness of snow cover on the ice.

A two figure visualization has the same symbolism as a single figure only with the dichotomy more fully expressed in the symbolism. And all this various visualizations are done with the figures on lotus flower to demonstrate that they are unstained by samsara, right?

My understanding is that Vajradhara is understood to be the enlightenment of Sakyamuni as seen from the Vajrayana perspective. So that's why at the very top of the Kagyu Refuge tree is a small Vajradhara, representing Sakyamuni. Then you also visualize your own teacher as Vajradhara, not because he is in any sense the same personage as Sakyamuni, but the enlightenment presented to you by him is still the enlightenment of Sakyamuni as has been passed down through the lineage(s).

Malcolm wrote:
This is not how things are presented in Dzogchen, or for that matter in Sakya or Nyingma. In both Sakya and Nyingma for example, the nirmanakāya is not considered to be the "Teacher". There is only one teacher, Buddha Samantabhadhra/Vajradhara. This single teacher, the dharmakāya, called Samantabhadra, emanates the Samabhogakāya, in this case Vajradhara, who in turn emanates the nirmanakāyas such as Śākyamuni. I am fairly certain the Kagyus also present things in this way.

The Gelugpas understand it the way you present it.

If you don't understand the five aggregates, you will never attain buddhahood. Why? Because you will never understand what absence of self really means in any concrete way.

The four or five elements are phenomenological descriptions of matter (hardness, liquidity, heat, motility and absence of obstruction), they are not considered things in themselves, at least, not in Yogacara on up.

If you do not understand the five elements, you will not understand the meaning of rūpaskandha.

It is amazing to see how people think that their limited, conventional, "empirical", consciousness is the benchmark for truth. This limited, conventional, "empirical", consciousness is precisely the reason we sentient beings transmigrate in samsara. The "empirical" world we experience is just a kind of karmic vision. It is no more true than a dream.

This is a different issue than the general teaching that variegated nirmanakāyas will appear for the benefit of sentient beings. No method for recognizing these is provided in the sūtras and tantras. Why? Because nirmanakāyas know they are nimanakāyas. They do not need a process of confirmation.

Everyone is a tulku. From my blog:

Karma Dondrup Tashi said:
The purpose of this post is to settle a controversy [and perhaps create another] and remove a misunderstanding about so called "sprul skus" or reincarnations, that venerable institution that causes so much controversy in Tibetan Buddhism.

In the teaching of the Great Perfection there are two kinds of so called nirmanakāyas or tulkus. First, there are impure forward-progression [ma dag pa lugs 'byung] nirmanakāyas  i.e. all sentient beings. These arise because of ignorance.

The second are pure reverse-progression [dag pa lugs ldog] nirmanakāyas: among these there are also two, those that come from the dharmakāya and sambhogakāya, nirmanākāyas of compassion if you will. The second are called nirmanakāyas of the attained result, these are sentient beings of pure karma, blessed by being seen by the buddhas, who make more and more progress, attaining higher and higher states of yogic understanding.

Thus we sentient beings are all nirmanakāyas -- differentiated only by our level of relative attainment and relative level of pure and impure karma.

The so-called "tulkus" of institutional Tibetan Buddhism are also sentient beings; some with higher yogic attainments, some with none, and others with some. Because they are sentient beings, some remember their rebirths well, and others not at all. Some achieve high levels of yogic understanding, some are great teachers, some are panditas, poets and artists. Some tulkus are mere politicians, some are gangsters, some are thieves. But they are all sentient beings. Not one of them was not born from the womb of a human mother.

Most tulkus are never "recognized" because anyone who practices Dharma sincerely is a tulku, no matter what level of "realization" they are reputed to have, whether or not they have been recognized. In this sense, a tulku is defined as someone who acts to help sentient beings inspired by the compassion of the buddhas for sentient beings.

We are all rinpoches, precious ones. Sentient beings are precious because their plight is the cause of the compassion of the buddhas. Buddhas are precious because they exist solely to aid sentient beings from suffering. I guess you could say it is rinpoches all the way down.

Some people crave recognition, wanting others to acknowledge their status -- consider yourselves acknowledged  but don't expect a title. If you want people to consider you a tulku, act like one. If you must, fake it. Faking it may even lead to developing some real compassion which exceeds your petty narrow-minded grasping to titles and position. Being a pure reverse-progression tulku means cherishing all sentient beings. Nothing is holding you back but your own selfishness.

The Dzogchen teachings acknowledge that all sentient beings are tulkus. But whether that is meaningful is not up to the buddhas, it is up to each one of us and our dedication to the path of awakening and benefitting our fellow tulkus.

In reality, tulkuhood is defined not by robes, titles, race, position, gender, education, or creed but by how we are able to apply wisdom and compassion in our efforts to aid sentient beings and alleviate their suffering.

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddha taught three paths: the path of renunciation which is common to Hinayāna and Mahāyāna; the path of transformation which is general Vajrayāna and the path of self-liberation, which is also termed Atiyoga.

The principles of the higher paths often seem to contradict the principles of the lower paths, but in reality, they are all aiming at the same point, buddhahood. If someone does not have faith in a path, for example, karmamudra, they should leave it aside and not criticize it, because many masters in India and Tibet have attained complete buddhahood through practicing this path. One should be careful not to criticize Vajrayāna teachings, because one will abandon the Dharma if one does so.

You will take birth as Nima Ozer, a master of kama and terma teachings
And you will serve beings through esoteric activities,

The funny thing too is that people somehow believe tulkus get better training than ordinary people. Really, this is a fantasy.

Well this has to be fixed.  And of course we have now passed the point in history where we can no longer provide a basic Dharma education to everyone desiring one.  So with a little work everyone can raise their level of scholarship and practice.

The main problem with offering incense to Nagas is that most Tibetan incense contains musk, and other animal products.

This year celebrates the 200th aniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin, best known for his theory of evolution summarized in On the Origin of Species. Less well known is that, in the second half of his life, Darwin’s major scientific focus turned towards plants. He wrote several books on plants, the next-to-last of which, The Power of Movement of Plants, published together with his son Francis, opened plants to a new view. Here we amplify the final sentence of this book in which the Darwins proposed that: “It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle thus endowed [with sensitivity] and having the power of directing the movements of the adjoining parts, acts like the brain of one of the lower animals; the brain being seated within the anterior end of the body, receiving impressions from the sense-organs, and directing the several movements.” This sentence conveys two important messages: first, that the root apex may be considered to be a ‘brain-like’ organ endowed with a sensitivity which controls its navigation through soil; second, that the root apex represents the anterior end of the plant body. In this article, we discuss both these statements.

Dr. Freya Reeves Lambides, Editor
Avalon to Camelot Dear Dr. Lambides,
My previous letter [Vol. 1 No. 4, p. 2] was hastily written, without the thought that it would be published. Of course my use of the term "fascism” was imprecise. The lesson, I suppose, is that one should not write anything one would not care to see in print.

However, I will stand on and even expand my indictment of chivalric literature, in which I have such illustrious predecessors as Petrarch and Cervantes. Chivalric literature has been predominantly deceptive; that is, it has attempted to mislead readers or listeners about historical truth. It has encouraged bloodshed for the sake of principle, and discouraged learning and study. It also promoted an immature concept of the relations between the sexes, and was, if not openly anti-Semitic (there is a famous example of the latter in the Cid), at least quite in harmony with the birth of modern anti-Semitism in the late Middle Ages.

Of course there are works which are exempt from some or all of the charges. Obviously the literature would not have been written or read if some desire for it were not there; however, to exonerate the literature on these grounds is the same as exonerating handguns with the argument “guns don’t kill people, people kill people.” Of our postwar presidents it was the most aggressive, who laid the foundation for the Vietnam War, with whom chivalry is most closely associated. The role of southern chivalry, derived from the neo-Arthurianism of Sir Walter Scott, in setting the scene for the Civil War was pointed out a century ago; nothing in southern chivalry was found incompatible with slavery. According to its constitution, the Ku Klux Klan embodies in its principles “all that is chivalric in conduct” (Stanley Frost, The Challenge of the Klan [1924; rpt. New York: AMS, 1969], p. 68).

I do, then, object to the glamorization and popularization of chivalric literature, and to the eager interest in those seemingly central questions, the existence of a historical Arthur and the origin of the grail legend. It is not that the investigation is wrong in itself (though it says something about us that chivalry is today the most popular aspect of the medieval world), but the motivation behind it is, on the whole, misguided. Chivalric literature, like all myths, should be studied, but not taught.

You have said you are not certain that Return to Camelot makes the case I imply. I will quote only one sentence from the opening paragraph of the final chapter, “The Great War”: “ One conclusion is undeniable: the ideals of chivalry worked with one accord in favor of war ” (p. 276).
Just as you found part of my letter hard to understand, one sentence in your answer is unclear to me. Who are the “beings like Merlin who transcend our known realities”? If you maintain that there are unknown realities, then you have left scholarship, and me, behind.
Sincerely,
Daniel Eisenberg

Urgyen Dorje said:
But the truth is that for a Westerner to practice a teaching that comes from Tibet there is no need for that person to become like a Tibetan. On the contrary, it is of fundamental importance for him to know how to integrate that teaching with his own culture in order to be able to communicate it, in its essential form, to other Westerners. But often, when people approach an Eastern teaching, they believe that their own culture is of no value. This attitude is very mistaken, because every culture has its value, related to the environment ment and circumstances in which it arose. No culture can be said to be better than another; rather it depends on the human individual whether he or she will derive greater or lesser advantage from it in terms of inner development. For this reason it is useless to transport rules and customs into a cultural environment different from the one in which they arose.

It is important to recognize however that there are Tibetan cultural practices, like recognizing tulkus, that are not actually part of the Dharma. Can anyone point me to a reference in either sūtra or tantra, Nyingma or Sarma, that says, "In the last 500 years of the Dharma, the only way the Dharma will be preserved is through recognizing small children as the reincarnations of dead masters"?

Of course we have to understand that the practice of recognizing tulkus began with the second and third Karmapa, and these masters were fantastic. Then it became a big fashion, and within 200 hundred years, tulkus were being recognized everywhere.

We also should understand that the 5th Dalai Lama's recognition, by his own account, was completely fraudulent. He was also a fantastic master, but he certainly was not the reincarnation of the fourth Dalai Lama.

The idea that you have to live this hardcore ascetic lifestyle to become a realized person is a myth. You do not need to spend years and years in retreat. I know many people who have spend years and years in retreat and they are just as screwed up now as when they went into retreat, and just as ordinary. I also have done long term intensive retreat (3+ years), and while it was an awesome experience, I certainly did not come out of it a realized person. At least according to my master, there is no need for this. As long as one applies the the teachings in a consistent way to one's life, integrating view, meditation and conduct,  then one will eventually attain realization. Anyway, most of us will attain realization in the bardo, not in this life.

The system is broken, irreparably. This does not mean that there are no realized masters recognizing proper candidates, but in general, most people recognized as tulkus, even by this or that high lama, are not really reincarnations.

There is a story told about Khyentse Wangpo. Some monks were seeking the reincarnation of their lama, and they went to him, he recognized this boy as a reincarnation, but the boy proved to be rather ordinary. They went back to Khentse Wangpo to express their doubt. He became a little annoyed, and said, "Do you want to find the real incarnation of your master."

The monks all very eagerly agreed. Khyentse told them, "Go out behind the barn and call your master's name."

They did so, and young bull calf broke away from his mother to come and greet them.

Part of the reason why the tulku system is broken is because of the expectations of average Tibetans who won't donate to monasteries that have no reincarnations.

Adzom Drugpa's life was constantly in danger when he was a boy because of his recognition, and ChNN was poisoned as a young age because he was recognized as Zhabdrung Ngagwang Namgyal's incarnation.

No one denies that there have been exemplary reincarnations who have been great masters. There have also been many more great masters who were not tulkus (thank goodness), such as Ngala Changchub Dorje, Thangton Gyalpo, etc., the list is very long.

In my personal experience, there definitely are Tulkus. I am not saying I'm one, but I have known a number very closely, including my son. I have known some when they were very young and still remembered their past life. I have known others who have lost those memories. I have known Tibetan Tulkus and American Tulkus. One of these American Tulkus is one of the best examples I know of a real Tulku with the knowledge and ability to back up His "pedigree." I have been involved in the search for my own Root Guru's reincarnation, and I can tell you that, up to the point I was involved, it was far from frivolous and was completely apolitical. It was also guided by two very highly practiced and developed Teachers Whose siddhi and sincerity I trust implicitly. I feel quite confident that some highly realized Lamas can identify Tulkus, know where They have been born and Who They currently are. I also am quite sure there are false Tulkus recognized only for political/financial reasons. I've known Tulkus Who were brought up inside the monastic institutions and Tulkus Whose parents chose not to go that route. I've known good and not so good Tulkus.

Why am I saying this? To say the whole system is bogus is, in my experience, incorrect. If ChNN and His Son are both genuine Tulkus, They Themselves prove the system is not bogus. To say the system is broken is also probably not incorrect. To say that the whole system should be abandoned A) is not gonna happen any time soon, and B) I think it is throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Young Tulkus Who are actually Tulkus and are either not trained or improperly trained are a great loss to themselves, the Dharma, and sentient beings. I say this having chosen not to allow my son to be trained in the traditional way. Should many of the young Tulkus be undergoing stricter, better training? Yes. Should I be undergoing stricter, better training? Also yes.

This is the Kaliyuga, the Dharma-ending age. Peoples' kleshas are getting stronger and stronger, thicker and thicker. We are all in this downward spiral of degeneration, and it takes more and more merit and wisdom to escape, let alone reverse, this trend. Do many young Tulkus today need a wake-up call? Yes, from my experience, I think so. Will all of Them heed that wake-up call? No. Will some? Yes -- some. Are there some really good young Tulkus out there? Yes, in my experience there are. Check out Khedrup Jigme Kundrol in Bhutan. Check out Guru Khyentse Ozer in Bhutan. Check out Kathog Situ Rinpoche in Bhutan. Check out Gyalwai Nyugu Rinpoche. All four of these young Tulkus appear, at least to me and my clouded perception, to exhibit real renunciation. And isn't that the real problem with those Tulkus Who are not living up to our expectations? Lack of renunciation.

Sorry if I'm rambling but I don't think the system is bogus top to bottom. I think the system requires change, possibly even radical change, but I don't think it should be scrapped entirely.

I sometimes wonder if YN is going to be seen a little more by webcast. The movie on his life and relationship with his father was great, and so were the activities accompanying the release of the movie (My Reincarnation), but since that time I have not heard much about YN's role within Dzogchen Community (present/future). I tuned in to the webcast he gave, but I don't know of any other webcasts besides the one he gave which was already several years ago.

This was after My Reincarnation was aired all over the world.

Characteristically, ChNN. while confident of his son's "pedigree", chose not to subject him to a monastic education.

AFAIK, CHNN's son and daughter will inherit the responsibility of continuing their father's legacy. Who knows what it will look like. I have no idea, myself.

Wouldn't it be good to let them experience the more shitty sides of todays samsare life for a few years, to motivate them to develop some amount of renunciation and a motivation to do something about the suffering present in the world?

It is a necessary thing to say. Chogyal Namkhai  Norbu has been pointing out the faults of the tulku system for many years, for example, pointing out that the qualities of reincarnations are usually progressively worse with each generation, rather than progressively better. Of course, ChNN is an outlier, and Tibetans really don't pay any attention to him. Despite his fame in the West, exile Tibetans in general regard him with suspicion and disdain. If they only had a clue, all of these young Tibetan tulkus in India interested in Dzogchen would study with him.

Truthfully, there is very little knowledge of Dzogchen teachings these days among the younger generation of Tibetan lamas. It is mostly intellectual dancing on books. These young guys really do not have very much knowledge even of the meaning of the two stages. They are mostly sutrayāna Kadampa style lamrimpas. So it is not wonder that people who follow such lamas have very little understanding of the real essence of the teachings. There are some notable exceptions in Tulku Urgyen's family, but Tulku Urgyen was a real Dzogchen master.

It’s the season when wildfires rage, and this year they’re raging particularly hard: In June alone, Alaska saw 1.1 million acres go up in flames. In California, firefighters had responded to 3,381 wildfires by July 11, “1,000 more than the average over the previous five years,” The New York Times reports in a big feature on wildfires in the state.

And that’s likely not a coincidence. A study published this week in Nature Communications connects worsening wildfire seasons to climate change, and suggests the trend will continue in the years ahead as climate change rolls forward. “Wildfires occur at the intersection of dry weather, available fuel and ignition sources,” the study’s authors write. Of those factors, “weather is the most variable.”

The study also suggests that wildfires will themselves play a role in driving climate change, creating a nasty feedback loop.

Ok so a vajra sibling posted this elsewhere. And the request was made by Rinpoche himself,

Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche said today in front of a large group of about 800 practitioners,
that he thinks the young Tibetan lineage holders coming up in general are quite unimpressive.
They're lazy and spoiled, and they need to do a lot better.

His goal of telling us was to a) shame them via back biting (he said this, not me.) by circulating
what he said on the internet. b) exceed the "lineage holders" by becoming great practitioners and
with a lot of knowledge ourselves, thereby shaming them into improving themselves.

He explicitly said that *some* Lamas even give empowerments for practices they haven't
themselves received. So we must basically become better than them, and thereby insisting
on qualified, experienced teachers that actually meet our needs as serious practitioners. So
maybe they will step up to the plate, as it were.

Kings are indeed the most dependent, and constantly under the sword of Damocles. But "the ruled" is an abstraction, and such a matter isn't relevant until it becomes so, people do not constantly bestow consent by virtue of doing nothing, it's a natural tendency towards respect for order and the rule of law, just a child can't be said to be under the guardianship of parents because they constantly grant consent, they simply do what is in their interest by dependent and conditioned nature, not by constant free choice -- which is why as I always say, a decent governmental structure is meaningless without a virtuous (and rational) populace.

Kings may or may not be fools however, and I would resist generalisations about people simply based upon how they were born. Such a natural aversion towards a group of people regardless of deeds done or undone cannot be, in my opinion, very equanimous or compassionate, and seems to reflect only knee-jerk reaction. I'd resist judgement until proven deserving of it.

Apparently this tool is not used in buddhism, which seems to mae sense since I have never heard of fasting exercises in buddhism (or do they exist?).

Is a mini ICE AGE on the way? Scientists warn the sun will 'go to sleep' in 2030 and could cause temperatures to plummet

A new grand solar minimum would not trigger another LIA; in fact, the maximum 0.3°C cooling would barely make a dent in the human-caused global warming over the next century. While it would be enough to offset to about a decade's worth of human-caused warming, it's also important to bear in mind that any solar cooling would only be temporary, until the end of the solar minimum.

Well, without going too much into restricted areas, of course seminal continence is also valued in Vajrayana. One treads a line here in discussing it at all, but to say that it is not a factor in Buddhist practice needs some qualification.

Malcolm wrote:
In general the tantras of secret mantra do not distinguish between sukra and ojas. However, the principle reason for seminal continence in Vajrayāna practice is that for men, semen is the basis of experiencing a blissful sensation.

In reality, what one needs to conserve is ojas. ChNN's Birth, LIfe and Death discusses the issue of the difference between semen [ khu ba ] and ojas [ mdangs ] in some detail and recommends releasing the former while conserving the latter.

In the Dzogchen intimate instructions, for example, the Khandro Nyinthig, this distinction is fully articulated, and there are techniques for conserving the latter while releasing the former.

In general, practitioners of Dzogchen do not have to worry about the issue of seminal retention unless they are suffering from ojas depletion [ojas is mainly depleted by stress]. They are more concerned with other kinds of bindus, the "ultimate" ones; not the the ones that come about from eating food.

In Tibetan medicine it is stated that forcefully trying to suppress ejaculation leads to stones and even impotence. So, guys, if you feel it move, it is better to let it go.

So for example you are angry, you apply the vajrayana practice and the anger is liberated into, I think with anger it's discerning wisdom. Case closed.

But if you are angry, apply the vajrayana practice, and afterwards despite giving your best you are still angry, then you might better switch to loving kindness practice, chopping wood, psychotherapy, whatever gets the job done and you out of that state of mind.

Anger is mirror-like wisdom. When anger is recognized as anger, that is mirror-like wisdom, then it is liberated. You don't need to apply some antidote to anger to "liberate" it into mirror-like wisdom, anger has always been mirror-like wisdom from the very beginning. Likewise, the five aggregates have always been the five buddhas and so on. This is why applying methods of contemplating the impurity of the body and so on are not proper for Vajrayāna practitioners.

It is so fundamental to their view, they even call themselves "nang pa", insiders, because they are convinced that the sole cause of all problems in the world come from inside, not from outside.

At maximum it perpetuates the attachment to sexual pleasure that already exists in your mindstream, just like having consensual sex with a partner does.

The advantage of masturbation to sex with a partner is that no attachment to another person is involved. For example it can not become the cause for being jealous and all the possible negative consequences this might develop (like insulting, harming or killing another person in a fit of jealous rage)

The positive and negative nature of actions is clearly defined by virtue of their object. So for example, harming a Buddha or killing an Arhat is a much worse transgression than killing a normal human being. The weight of an action is defined by our intent, satisfaction and so on.

My point still stands — when one masturbates, one is not harming anyone else, no more than eating food harmful to anyone else.

The criteria of why the ten nonvirtues are nonvirtuous has to do mainly with how the seven physical nonvirtues impact others around us.

Masturbation is a transgression only for monastics, while it may be included in sexual misconduct from a preceptual point of view, it has to be considered primarily a transgression of disobedience. Sexual misconduct is a natural transgression because it harms others. Since masturbation does not fulfill this requirement, it is therefore not part of sexual misconduct. These days it is a little hard to justify oral sex and anal sex as sexual misconduct as well, from the natural nonvirtue point of view. I think in general this is why there is just not much heat about it. One does not hear Buddhist teachers railing against fellatio and cunnalingus, etc., in the same way they trip out against eating meat and drinking alcohol...speaking of which it is time for me to go have dinner...

While I will certainly agree with you that there is no inherently existing negative mental factors, nevertheless mental factors can be considered inherently bad if they invariably produce negative effects.

But really, we do not have to be allergic to the word "inherent." Indian Buddhist scholars use it all the time in a positive fashion, even Nāgārjuna.

The main point of course is that the ten nonvirtues are nonvirtues naturally, and do not depend on a social context to make them "bad." If you indulge in them, you will take rebirth in lower realms; if you practice their opposite, you will take rebirth in higher realms — no precepts needed.

Zhen Li said:
You are not properly making a distinction between precepts and the ten nonvirtues. You must learn to make this distinction, otherwise you will never understand the principle of Hināyāna teachings.

The ten nonvirtues are nonvirtues because they cause disruption to others. The ten virtues are virtues because observing them creates harmony with others. This has nothing to do with vows, trainings and so on.

Malice, greed and ignorance are nonvirtues inherently because they motivate acts which disturb others. Their opposite, love, generosity and wisdom are inherently virtuous because they motivate acts that benefit others. This is what makes virtuous conduct socially valuable and laudable.

This is the first I've heard of such inherency, and is exactly the kind of thing that theanarchist is arguing against. Source?

Malcolm wrote:
You do not need a source. Do the action of animals cause them to fall into lower realms, yes or no? Animals cannot take precepts, nor train in them, nevertheless their virtuous and nonvirtuous actions have karmic consequences. Therefore all actions are either virtuous, nonvirtuous or neutral, inherently so.

However, you can understand this from Vasubandhu's discussion of alcohol with regard to lay persons were he makes a distinction between transgressions by nature and transgressions through disobedience.

We can understand then that the precepts concerning killing, stealing, lying and sexual misconduct are all vows linked with natural nonvirtues, the breaking of which are transgressions by nature  — the rest of Hinayāna Buddhist vows are transgressions through disobedience.

Which is not to say that Atisha did not also say that.

It also says the same after another quote - which would make sense: "The Great Elder also taught this."
But in fact there is no evidence that masturbation is what is being referred to. The comment is really rather non-specific.

Again, this is not very specific. yes, mouth, anus, etc.

In short, it is extremely silly to make broad declarations for the Tibetan tradition on the basis of one text by an Indian author which is not supported, AFAICT, in sūtras found in the Tibetan Canon.

Sexual misconduct should be defined on the basis of conduct that is harmful others. We can see in the instance of minors, those under the protection of others, the spouses of others, in places where public offense will be taken and so on, that there is clear harm to others. But we cannot see this in the case of masturbation. Frankly, it is a little difficult to see how oral sex is harmful to others as long as it is consensual. I would suggest that morays around nonharmful sexual conduct are strictly cultural and may be adjusted to suit cultural climates. In general the ten nonvirtues all depend on how one relates to other sentient beings. It is very easy to see why malice, greed and ignorance are harmful to others, as motivators for killing, stealing, sexual misconduct in general, as well as lying, harsh speech, calumny and gossip. But is very hard to see where consensual sexual acts can fit here as nonvirtues unless one is a monk or a nun.\

What you fail to understand is that the ten nonvirtues are defined as "natural" in so far as it does not matter if you are ant or an anteater. They have nothing to do with trainings, and everything to do with establishing what creates eudaemonic environment for everyone. Precepts are abstracted out of those, and of course, we can understand that consuming alcohol, for lay people, is the only prohibition which is by command, rather than through observing inherency. When you say that masturbation is sexual misconduct, you are making the claim it is inherently nonvirtuous, like killing, stealing, lying and assaulting minors.

No, that is too monolithic a statement. The Buddhist tradition holds masturbation is sexual misconduct for monks — on that we can all agree. The issue is whether it is to be considered the same for lay people, and that is a contested issue, it is not settled at all.

Concerning the sūtra text, without a Sanskrit original or a Tibetan translation to compare the Dharmakṣema translation to, it is uncertain.

Atisha, BTW, says no such thing.

Tsongkhapa mistaken attributes the passage from Daśākuśalakarmapathanirdeśa to Atisha. Please see foot note 386 in the Snow Lion Edition of volume one of Lam Rim Chen mo.

Tsongkhapa himself does not mention it.

So you are down to two actual texts that say anything about the issue. Only one in the Tibetan tradition, a late short text on the ten nonvirtues and an Chinese translation by a translator of dubious repute.

Considering the paucity of sources, I would say your claim is slim at best.

The point of the precepts, as far as the Buddhist texts are concerned, is training (as in the Pali, sikkhāpadaṃ, rule for training) and avoiding actions that are unwholesome (akusala) and not conducive to awakening and which conduce to a bad rebirth.

In which hell or preta realm does one take rebirth for masturbating? Why is there complete silence on the issue in Abhidharma?

Why is there complete silence in the issue in sūtra, apart from the one Chinese sūtra you can produce? Maybe it is really not so important.

Malcolm wrote:
This indeed really quite late. There is no sutra that mentions it, and in Vinaya it applies strictly to monastics.

But can you explain how these criteria address the matter of application of a sutra to oneself? In what cases, and why, does a sutra become applicable to oneself? Also, where does Tibetan canon vs. non-Tibetan canon influence this?

As far as I have read Buddhist texts, I never once came across the notion of applicability or inapplicability of a sutra to oneself.

Malcolm wrote:
As to your first question, it depends on the understanding and maturity of the practitioner. A 13 year old boy needs different teachings than a 70 year old man. Sutras are like medicine — if one has a specific illness, one applies an appropriate diet, conduct, medicine and therapy. If one has a specific problem, one applies to Buddha's teachings to that problem. But there is no such thing as one teaching that suits every person.

Your next question can be answered for example, by looking in the Abhidharmakośabhaṣyaṃ. Theravadins for example, do not accept the antarabhāva because they reject the sūtra in which it is taught since it is absent from their own canon. Vasubandhu points that many sūtras have been lost, and then proceeds to argue the point for the antarabhāva on logical grounds.

People who work for the state therefore are not permitted to impose their religious prejudice in the coarse of their normal duties, and if they are found to do so, are likely to be prosecuted for violating the civil rights of others. Somehow, the tea party people have forgotten all about the first amendment.

However, the basis of the SCOTUS decision regaring marriage is founded on the due process clause of the 14th amendment:
"[w]ithout doubt...denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.
You see, here, there is no restriction placed around who can marry, establish a home and raise children. Anyone may marry anyone else, and unless they are proven to be unfit, may raise children.

You can argue all you like that when this was written individuals meant individual men and women, nevertheless, societies change, and since gender is not specified in the Constitution, and since DOMA has been thrown out as entirely unconstitutional (rightly so), marriage equality was recognized. It is a done deal, and the rest of the modern world will follow suit, leaving Fundamentalists to deal with the issue as best they can, whether well nor poorly.

We live in a federal republic. This means that federal law trumps state law every time. SCOTUS has decided that the states are not allowed to pass laws forbidding people of the same gender to be married. This is a good thing.

Some things, like marriage equality, simply boil down to questions of fairness. Fairness, as we know, is the essence of justice. As Rawls notes:

maybay said:
The two principles of justice (noted above) are as follows:

a. Each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme for all; and in this scheme the equal political liberties, and only those liberties, are to be guaranteed their fair value.

b. Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions: first, they are to be attached to positions and offices open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity; and second, they are to be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society.

Further:

maybay said:
This priority of the right over the good in justice as fairness turns out to be a central feature of the conception. It imposes certain criteria on the design of the basic structure as a whole; these arrangements must not tend to generate propensities and attitudes contrary to the two principles of justice (that is, to certain principles which are given from the first a definite content) and they must insure that just institutions are stable.

Malcolm wrote:

The only thing Shakyamuni thought beings deserved was to be enlightened, but sadly their karma prevented that from happening.

However, I've heard other Buddhists say that karma is fair and that people deserve the higher realms, lower realms, et cetera, kind of like, "What goes around comes around."

The study from Mora and the University of Hawaii, Manoa, shifts the way in which climate scientists have been examining the implications of greenhouse emissions.
While most have focused on the rapidly warming climate in the Arctic and the effects on wildlife such as polar bears and also sea levels, Mora's team are concerned with the effects on people - specifically the tropics - where the majority of the world's population lives and whose citizens have contributed the least to global warming.
It is in the already warm tropics that an increase of only a couple of degrees can alter the balance of life, crippling crops, spreading disease and leading to mass migration away to cooler climes.
'The warming in the tropics is not as much but we are rather more quickly going to go outside that recent experience of temperature and that is going to be devastating to species and it is probably going to be devastating to people,' said Stuart Pimm, a conservation biologist at Duke University, to
NBC News.
Mora and his colleagues collated global climate models and built an index of estimates on when a given spot on the globe will change beyond temperatures experienced on Earth over the past 150 years between 1860 and 2005.

They say that rebirth as an animal is due to the emotion of ignorance or confusion. Ignorance isn't an emotion in English, so this confuses me. Does it mean naively holding wrong views? Well technically, doesn't everyone who is not Buddhist hold wrong views? What sort of mind state would result in you being reborn as an animal and not a human?

Malcolm wrote:
The word they are translation as "emotion" is klesha. Klesha in best translated as affliction.

Cultivating love and compassion results in birth in the higher realms; once there however, pride overtakes one's mind.

This is somewhat relevant for me, as some close dharma friends follow the tradition of Chatral-la, Shabkar, Patrul and so on, and they're pretty serious about the vegetarian thing, and they too point to Chatral Rinpoche and his family.  I also have close dharma friends who follow the tradition held by your teacher, Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, whom I also consider a teacher from webcast transmissions, who follows the traditional view that eating animals benefits them.

Loppon-la, where are you getting this idea about Kyabje Chatral Rinpoche? If this teaching is only for non-practitioners, why is He so personally insistent on not eating meat? When I used to prescribe Chinese medicines for Him, even these had to be free of any animal ingredients. His whole family are vegetarians, His entire retinue. These people are some pretty heavy-hitting practitioners. Are you saying Seymo Saraswati Rinpoche is not a practitioner, Khandro Kamala is not a practitioner?

I've eaten in His house with Him and His family a number of time. No one is eating meat.

I understand that Chatral Rinpoche is himself a strict vegetarian and teetotaler since the time he was 48, I believe.

But here, Chatral Rinpoche is setting an example for people who are not really practitioners (and I am excluding his family, close entourage). It is understandable. Most Tibetans are not really Dzogchen practitioners. That is the context in which you need to understand both mine and ChNN's statements.

Am I correct in thinking that these mantras are okay for any person to compassionately use while eating meat? The mani mantra is one of them. Can a person use any old mantra to bless the meat of dead animals?

And if it really is so simple for lay people to make a good connection dead animals, why do some Tibetan Buddhists act like these methods don't exist? Is it a sectarian thing?

Lingpupa said:
Some Nyingma empowerments have a large number of subsidiary parts: the dorje empowerment, the bell empowerment, the shawl empowerment, the earring empowerment and so on. There can be dozens of them. One possibility is the "hair" empowerment in which the disciple is "empowered" and committed to never cut their hair again. Just like monks and nuns shave their heads as a sign of renunciation, so the long hair of the dzogchen yogi is worn as a sign of the disciple's commitment to leaving their mind in its natural state.

My tip would be to avoid it unless you are very sure, as you may find, perhaps some years down the line, that you want or need to look more conventional again.

Malcolm wrote:
Seconded. You have to be very sure you can follow this samaya before you take it.

However, it is not so much about looks. Long hair can be conventional, but here you are not allowed to trim you hair or cut it, so if you get knots in your hair that you cannot comb out, well, you have to leave them.

I think it's useful to appreciate that there are subtexts woven through this subject.   It's clear to me that inji converts to vajrayana are responding to a variety of issues, as are contemporary lamas, all of which stand outside the skillful means of the vajrayana.  Quite bluntly, at least in America, we've gone insane when it comes to food, in particular animal products.  It's the only time in human history that people intentionally drive animals into various disease states only to eat them.  It's a far cry from hunting-gathering, and it's a far cry from culling herd-stocks from a local microecology.  It's really a form of madness. It's also an American thing to feel that we're malnourished unless our whole alimentary canal is full of red meat, which is another form of madness, and simultaneously a health and environmental crisis.  Whether the response of vegetarian ganapuja's is the proper response is really up to individuals and their lamas IMHO, but I think it's best to be realistic and honest that people are responding to this issue of meat eating along multiple axes...

Of course people are responding to this issue along a variety of axes. I am merely clarifying the principles enunciated by Chogyal Namkhai Norbu and Dzogchen teachings (Do you have any idea of how many kinds of meat are recommended for Chulen in the sgra thal gyur tantra?)

Meat and dairy consumption is rising world wide because, frankly, meat and dairy based diets are more nutritionally dense than solely plant-based diets and people become larger and more powerful when they rely on them. When they enter the middle class, of course they want more meat in their diets. Of course this brings a range of health issues into play.

1) First you have to know Lam Rim to compare, and I know Lam Rim, there isn't any "Lam Rim" lacking in CHNN's teachings,
in other words, all of deepest levels of Lam Rim are fulfilled in the Dzogchen teachings of CHNN, but you have to know what you are looking for. If you want straight up traditional teachers to learn Lam Rim there are many, for example, step by step here: http://thubtenchodron.org/1991/04/stage ... ent-intro/ but if you know the teachings, and you hear CHNN year in and out, you will see that Dzogchen path fulfills and explains the essence of all the Lam Rim teachings. Also remember that CHNN is a Dzogchen master, he is coming at those very topics from that view, therefore the answer to your question lies in the path itself. That path is where you will see differences and similarities to a highly traditional approach, but there is nothing on this path that goes contrary to those teachings, rather it fulfills those teachings quite completely. Remember CHNN was trained thoroughly and completely in Lam Rim, he has both an extensive Kagyu background and Sakyapa background and knows the Lam Rim well, he could easily compare back and forth topic by topic point by point how Dzogchen path does not lack the essence of the Lam Rim.  Quite frankly many of the teachers in Dzoghchen community and beyond can explain this, an in depth answer could fill many pages.

2) Yes, there are many places like this, both in the USA and all over the world. If you are in the USA toward the East Coast you could visit Conway Ma. this summer when CHNN is there, and meet members of the Dzogchen community and learn some practices in person. http://tsegyalgar.org/localcenters/tsegyalgareast/

Thank you very much for your answers, it is much appreciated! Regarding the Lam Rim question, that was my sense of it from what I've seen in researching this question.

And regarding the second point, thank you, that's good to know! I'm trying to see if I can request the time off from work to go and experience that retreat, even if it's for one day in order to receive transmission in person.

anjali said:
Agreed. In an ideal world no animals would be slaughtered. Your answer helps me refine my question.

Sadly, we don't live in an ideal world. Vajrayana practitoners live in a world where so many animals are slaughtered for consumption. Given that fact, would the most compassionate diet possible be one where every bite we take is making a connection with a slaughtered animal?

Yes, I know this is going to an extreme, but I'm not being flippant. Just pushing the envelope to get at the full implication that eating meat with right view benefits the consumed animal. Followed to it's logical conclusion, it would seem to imply that the most ethical/compassionate diet for a vajrayana practitioner living in today's world should be an exclusively meat-eating diet?

Malcolm wrote:
Every bite we take is already connected with a slaughtered animal down to every piece of lettuce. Therefore, the most ethical and compassionate diet is to understand that every thing we eat involves the death of some creature somewhere, somehow.

The principle of Buddhadharma is avihimsa, non-harming. But there is very little we can do in the world control the harm of the kind of wide spread agriculture and other related industries do to the world and the living creatures in it, both sentient and non-sentient. We cannot control other human beings, all we can do is control ourselves, refrain from harming others, and try to benefit those who have been harmed by any means possible. When someone who has received Dzogchen teachings refuses to eat meat when it is offered to them, or in a puja, they are effectively deciding not to help some being that has been harmed. In this case, not eating meat harms compassion.

Since we are not Jains nor followers of Devadatta, we do not believe that karma is an automatic non-volitional force that comes from every act that we engage in. Karma only comes from any intentional act in which we engage.

Also we have a responsibility to ourselves. We must eat meat when it is indicated for our health. There are, in both Ayurveda and Tibetan medicine, many forms of meat, many kinds of animal products, that are used regularly. The reason we do not use regular Tibetan incense for Nāgā pujas is because in general Tibetan incense contains musk, which is harmful and offensive to Nāgās. Also we must not eat too much of any one thing, because this will cause our humors to become unbalanced. So the principle of nonharming includes not harming ourselves, and that extends to our diets.

As in everything, there are limits to our capacity. So we do what we can, always wish we could do more and never lose our focus of compassion for all.

From where I sit the gist of the entire issue comes down to; do I personally have enough confidence in a specific wong I have received to invest myself in a retreat on that practice? Because if the wong was not valid I will be wasting my time, no fruit will come.

As such, the question for me personally is really moot. Up until now I have not done long retreats on any practice, so what does it matter? And if I do decide to go do a retreat somewhere, I've got all the in-person wongs I could ever need. So for me I can happily participate on internet Dharma all day long and presumably it will be only of some benefit. I don't have to actually rely on any of it. I liken it to the idea behind prayer flags, which is that the mantras and prayers on the flags get blown downwind and spread their blessings that way. Only instead of the wind the blessings "blown" all over the planet via the internet. Why not?

For those that are isolated and have to rely on internet Dharma as the basis for their practice, I suggest that they do a little study of how "faith" comes into play for an initiation. The prevailing internet culture, and even the prevailing modern in-person Dharma culture, adamantly insists that faith is not required in Buddhism. In contrast to that, Garchen R. has said that without faith even an in-person wong is ineffective. This needs to be understood and not rationalized or re-defined in such a way as to accommodate our modern preconditions for Dharma.

All very good advice, unfortunately, it has nothing do with the question at hand. The question at hand is how to properly enter into the training Tulku Orgyen is talking about. So this topic is not mere criticism for criticism's sake.

Lhasa said:
TULKU URGYEN
Extract from a Teaching.
Pure Perception:

"Vajrayana in general is training in pure perception—Dzogchen is even much more so.

How can you call yourself a practitioner of Dzogchen if you spend your time defaming, finding fault with or criticizing others? Maintain the view of pure sight, sound and awareness. This is how samsara and nirvana actually are, pervaded by the three kayas or three vajras. Sentient beings might not be aware of their Buddha Nature, but they are nevertheless endowed with the three kayas.

You need to train in pure perception by accepting and respecting the three kayas in everyone. Great masters do perceive all sights, sound and cognitive activity as infinite purity. Once recognition of awareness is stabilized, there is no more impurity to be perceived.

Train in this by thinking: "As the Buddha Nature pervades all beings, not a single being is unsuitable." The more you respect Buddha Nature in others and train in pure perception, the more your own practice will progress.

Slandering beings is slandering Buddha nature; stop doing that. If due to your own impurity you perceive mistakes in other beings, at least do not voice them.
If your awareness practice is too weak to sustain pure perception naturally, try to develop a rapport within an intellectual understanding of Buddha Nature in others. Know that your impure perception of others only happens either because you have not recognized genuine awareness, or because that recognition is not developed. Criticizing and slandering others puts you out of tune with the enlightened essence.

You mainly harm yourself. The most unrealized so-called practitioner of Dzogchen can at least keep his or her mouth shut, even if he can not actually maintain the view.

A deceitful person sees everybody with suspicion and finds many mistakes in others. A pure person naturally perceives others to be good. How much more so does a perfect yogin or yogini. He or she has the perception of infinite purity. They will actually perceive all forms as the bodies of the deities, all sounds as mantra, and all thoughts and emotions as the display of awareness.

In their perception of pure sight, sound and awareness there is no attachment to friends, or aversion to enemies. Awareness itself being free from concepts of good and bad, proper and improper, they perceive everything as great equanimity. They do not accept or reject friends or foes. They perceive not the tiniest speck of impurity.

As is said, "Arriving at a golden island, one cannot find ordinary earth or stones even if one searches for them." In general, good and bad are your own perception, so you cannot possibly see faults in others when your own are purified."

So that applies to the other 5 meats too?

Then what about certain statements that they should be consumed in ganapujas? One must be a vidyadhara to consume the 5 meats?

Malcolm wrote:
I said in general. Ganapujas are a special case. Here, the point is consuming the five meats traditionally not consumed by Indians and left in the charnel grounds, i.e., meat of humans, cows, elephants, dogs and horses. Why? Because these meats were regarded by Brahmins as impure. The point in this instance is to overcome attachment to so called "pure and impure" food. And no, one does not have to be a Vidyadhāra to consume these meats in the ganacakra. But I think that most people would not be able to manage this. This is a general principle in niruttarayogatantra.

The principle here in Dzogchen is however a bit different. The point here is to create a positive cause for the cattle, fowl and fish that we humans normally consume in order that sentient being meet with the Dharma, and so on, in future lives.

There is the interesting case of Urgyen Lingpa's body. Urgyen Lingpa was held to be a seven timer, i.e, reborn as a brahmin or in Tibet, a tulku, seven times. It is held that his flesh had the power to create a special cause for those who ate small portions of it. So, his mummified kudung (unfortunately now destroyed) in Tibet was pockmarked from people taking small portions of his flesh for this reason. Once, when Chogyal Namkahi Norbu was giving Medicine Buddha in Tsegyalgar, he included a pill containing the flesh of this master in the vase water.

How about humans who have lived without connection to Dharma despite their precious human births? Can one create this connection by eating their flesh?

Malcolm wrote:
Two things here: first, a human birth is not "precious" unless one has a connection with Dharma.

Second, human meat (as well as the meat of predators) is in general forbidden to people. One cannot create a positive connection by doing something nonvirtuous.

Also human beings can be benefitted by liberation through seeing, hearing, smelling, etc., as well, even if they have no interest in or connection with the Dharma.

It's no different than buying a pair of leather shows because you like the look and fit, or a silk shirt because you like the look and feel of silk, or a pashmina shawl because it is stylish and keeps you warm.

One does not need to be a "realized practitioner" to benefit beings through consuming their meat. As I pointed out above, when you consume meat using Vajrayāna methods, those animals will all be reborn as your disciples when you become a buddha yourself.

The same thing applies when weather leather shows, wool sweaters, silk shirts and so on.

Would you kindly explain this a bit further?

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, the practice of sgrol ba, liberation, is the practice of wrathfully separating a sentient being's consciousness from its body through ritual means and delivering it into the dharmadhātu. There are ten criteria through which someone or something might be subject to such a rite. For example, there is a large wasp that lives in Bhutan and Southern Tibet called "rGya nag rgyal po" (Chinese King). It kills many small creatures and drags them into its burrow, paralyzes them, and lays its eggs in them. According to the late Kunzang Dechen Lingpa, this creature is completely wicked, and its sting can be fatal to humans. Using this wasp as an example, he said there are some creatures who should be killed and that one should not naively allow one's Mahāyāna orientation to prevent one from seeing what is the greater good for all beings, just to protect the life of one wicked being. He said that in this case, proper Mahāyāna conduct would be to eliminate Gyanag Gyalpos wherever and whenever one found them because these creatures are pernicious.

The six liberations are peaceful methods, and involve creating good causes for sentient beings to meet the teachings in the future through sight, sound, smell, taste, touch and memory using various visual mantras, incenses made according to special recipes, pills, and so on.

Basically, when one uses the methods of creating good causes, all of those animals that one consumes in future lives will take rebirth as one's students when oneself becomes an awakened being. This is why theanarchist's objections are based on a faulty premise.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, this is true. Likewise, when you wear silk shirts, you are paying for the death of silk worms. When you wear leather, you are also paying the butcher. When you wear wool, you are paying for the deaths of countless creatures that inhabit the wool of sheep that are sheared as well as the paying for the cruel suffering endured by the sheep, as well as the lambs who are stolen from their mothers by the sheep herders and butchered for their meat and so on. If you buy glue, you are paying the butcher for the hooves and so on. Do you have pets? If so, again you are paying the butcher. Do you pay taxes, then you are paying for wars, executions, imprisonment and so on.

Are you karmically responsible? No. karma is volition and and verbal and physical acts which come from volitions. If you have no volition to kill something, you do not accrue the karma of killing. If you do not ask someone to kill something, again you have no karma related to that act of killing. Buying meat in a shop is no more an act of killing than buying leather shoes in a department store.

Malcolm wrote:
Bhavaviveka proves, even while mentioning the Lanka and so on, that eating meat in three ways does not contribute to suffering. If eating meat pure in three ways contributes to suffering, he points out so does wearing wool, leather, silk etc.

So, in fact, as long as the meat one consumes is pure in three ways it does not contribute to the suffering of a given animal at all. I know this is hard for people to understand, but it is the case.

In reality it is impossible for us to remove the suffering of other sentient beings at all, even one tiny bit. Not even Buddhas can remove the suffering of other beings. If we believe that by refusing to eat meat we are reducing some other beings suffering, we are deluding ourselves because we have not understood the nature of suffering at all. As Maitreya points out in samsare there is not so much as an area the size of a needle tip in which happiness may be found. Therefore, what can we do to help? All we can do is make efforts at creating positive causes for sentient beings to meet the Dharma in the future. For example, the Root Tantra of Heruka states that Vajrayāna practitioners themselves are "Liberation through seeing." Any being who sees Vajrayāna practitioner plants a seed for meeting the Buddhas and hearing Dharma teachings. But dead animals cannot see or hear anything. Therefore, we have methods connected with creating a positive cause for those sentient beings whom human beings commonly consume because we have a closer relationship with those types of animals.

Question is, "Is it better, out of compassion, to eschew eating meat or not?" ChNN's answer is that question is that it is better not to eschew eating meat out of compassion. If a Dzogchen practitioner is truly compassionate it is better they eat meat.

It does not cause the death of that one chicken, but the supermarket WILL order one more chicken to fill its spot. You may pretend that second chicken has nothing to do with you... until the next week when you go back to the market and lo and behold, there are more dead chickens waiting for you.

Whether you choose to participate in this or not is surely a very individual matter, and the matter of connecting with dead chickens is far above my pay grade. But it's crazy to take part in a system and then pretend you have precisely zero complicity in it. We all make choices that harm other beings, and though there's no point in being weighed down by guilt over them, it's disingenuous to claim that we're doing all of them for noble reasons. We can simply do what we can, and admit we're not fully compassionate beings yet.

So he declined to give them advice in the matter.

As far as your counterclaim goes, that applies only to feed lot animals, animals raised in CFO's and so on, like most chickens, pigs, turkeys and what not.

As far as your claim about supermarkets go, it is also false. Supermarkets will continue to order meat from meat suppliers for as long as there are people who eat meat (i.e. forever).

Also, even Vegans participate in the trade of flesh by continuing to eat organically grown products which are fertilized with bone meal, blood meal and feather meal, all very standard organic amendments which are substantial cash inputs into the slaughterhouse business.

The point is that there is no one who is not complicit in some manner in "the system".

People are free. Whether they eat meat or not is not the issue. The issue really that Rinpoche is pointing to is the fallacies in the idea that choosing not to eat meat is more "compassionate". He has pointed in many ways the falsity of this thinking because it does not truly address the suffering of nonhumans in the whole chain of agricultural production.

Quite honestly, the American Philosopher, Robert Nozik provides a much better and more well reasoned argument for not eating animals in his Anarchy, State and Utopia where he discards utilitarian arguments for the eating of animals because animals "count for something."

Anders said:
If some animals count for something, which animals count, how much do they count, and how can this be determined? Suppose (as I believe the evidence supports) that eating animals is not necessary for health and is not less expensive than alternate equally healthy diets available to people in the United States. The gain, then, from the eating of animals is pleasures of the palate, gustatory delights, varied tastes. I would not claim that these are not truly pleasant, delightful, and interesting. The question is: do they, or rather does the marginal addition in them gained by eating animals rather than only nonanimals, outweigh the moral weight to be given to animals’ lives and pain? Given that animals are to count for something, is the extra gain obtained by eating them rather than nonanimal products greater than the moral cost? How might these questions be decided?

Are organisms arranged on some ascending scale, so that any may be sacrificed or caused to suffer to achieve a greater total benefit for those not lower on the scale? Such an elitist hierarchical view would distinguish three moral statuses (forming an interval partition of the scale):

Status 1: The being may not be sacrificed, harmed, and so on, for any other organism’s sake.
Status 2: The being may be sacrificed, harmed, and so on, only for the sake of beings higher on the scale, but not for the sake of beings at the same level.
Status 3: The being may be sacrificed, harmed, and so on, for the sake of other beings at the same or higher levels on the scale.

If animals occupy status 3 and we occupy status 1, what occupies status 2? Perhaps we occupy status 2! Is it morally forbidden to use people as means for the benefit of others, or is it only forbidden to use them for the sake of other people, that is, for beings at the same level?* Do ordinary views include the possibility of more than one significant moral divide (like that between persons and animals), and might one come on the other side of human beings?

There are also Singer's arguments.

So the real question that ChNN is placing before us is: what does one do for the countless sentient beings that are slaughtered in food production? How do we benefit all these sentient beings (who indeed count for something)? What method do we use? Even Vegans have to admit that they use the above elite hierarchical model in their ethics, a "being may be sacrificed, harmed, and so on, for the sake of other beings at the same or higher levels on the scale" merely by permitting agriculture. However, their excuse, is in my opinion very lame. They claim in general, "While it is true that beings die in the production of plant-based food, we do not intend that harm nor are we raising beings to be used as food. The death of beings in food production is a regrettable fact of agriculture, a by-product that we do not intend but cannot avoid in order to sustain ourselves."

In other words, they claim they are following their diet because of the intrinsic value of living creatures, but at the same time resort to utilitarianism to rationalize the broad destruction of creatures in food production, claiming a utilitarian advantage to a plant based diet as a selling point, i.e. the myth that "less creatures would be killed in a plant-based diet." The other hoax in their thinking is that idea that we should not exploit creatures such as cows and bees for milk and honey, while happily using lady bugs to kill agricultural pests and so on.

You can PM me if that's what you prefer.

Malcolm wrote:
I think it is pretty clear that Garchen Rinpoche wants students to attend in person or by live webcast. As far as recordings go, I imagine that his thinking runs as follows, "if beginners, new people, want to practice, they can get an idea from watching an online recording, and perhaps there is some positive connection made to the teaching and if they recite the mantra, there is no harm."

But for example, HHDL makes it very clear that watching Kalacakra online does not grant one the empowerment. Also CHNN makes it very clear that empowerments that rely on substances cannot be given via webcast. Other Lamas may have a different ideas about this, but I really think in general all Lamas will agree that there is no way one can receive an empowerment from a recording of an empowerment. I am quite certain, for example, if you wrote ChNN on this subject, he would say very clearly to you that you cannot receive any kind of transmission from a recording.

And one thing I am pretty clear on is that no one receives empowerments or a lung from a recording.

I am something in a similar situation as LunaRoja, and am also informed by Pollen and others in terms of food politics.  In the final analysis, it's actually hunting-gathering that has the least ecological impact and the least amount of suffering, so I figure I'm OK interpolating between a vegetarian diet and something of a flexitarian diet.

That said, this causes me some pause in dharma circles.  I feel somewhat caught between a rock and a hard place.  My vegetarian-vegan dharma siblings evoke Shabkar and Patrul on the Tibetan side, and sutra on the Chan/Zen side, and chide me for this flexitarian approach and chide me for incorporating meat in ganapuja.  We have had vegetarian-vegan Buddhists show up for ganapuja and they have been horrified by the presence of meat.  On the flip side, when I orbit into the vegan-vegetarian side of the pool, then I have my tantrica friends chiding me for "the worst type of compassion" and for breaking samaya at ganapuja for either putting on a white tsok, or for just tasting but not actively eating meat and drinking alcohol.

In some way I feel that I am on the margin of some larger cultural issue, maybe from the Tibetan side, but maybe from the inji convert side.

It's not just about meat either.  I often encounter this belief that all five tastes must be present in the ganapuja, and this becomes something of a fault line when two people bring pickles and nobody ends up with "bitter" or "pungent".  When I ask lamas they're like, well, in my part of Tibet we offered tsampa and just tsampa because that's all we had, so it's clear the forrest is lost for the trees on many levels.

Malcolm wrote:
Ok, first it is six tastes (sweet, salty, sour, hot, bitter, astringent) and though there may be some text that specifies this, I have never seen it.

It is possible that one can do a ganapuja with nothing at all, after all, the important part is to work with circumstances. However, there is no one among us who unable to get meat and unable to get alcohol as offerings.

As to the idea of using nectar pills, well, this does not challenge one's capacity nor does it encourage one to integrate. The adoption of vegetarianism into ganapujas is a misapplication of the path of renunciation (i.e. common Mahāyāna) to Varjayāna.

According to ChNN,  Zhabkar, Paltrul and Pema Duddul's exhortations to not eat meat are for non-practitioners, that is, people who do not understand the meaning of Dzogchen teachings.

I can only speak for myself in saying that that understanding is enough for me to eliminate consuming meat as part of my diet, or consuming the least amount possible to satisfy vows in a ritual setting.

Malcolm wrote:
The terms for Sanskrit and Tibetan respectively are rūpa and gzugs. It is become a common thing for translators to translate rūpaskandha as the "form aggregate", but it is not accurate and does not correspond with the definition of form in English "configuration, formation, structure, construction, arrangement, appearance, exterior, outline, format, layout, design." What does correspond is "matter", i.e. "constituent, raw material, element, component."

When we are taking about the rūpāyatana, the sense base of form, however, the object of the eye, then form is perfect, i.e., "configuration, formation, structure, construction, arrangement, appearance, exterior, outline, format, layout, design."

Words are relative, but they important in that they shape our understanding. If the terms we use are not accurate, how can our understanding be accurate? Geshe Dhargye never thought about these things in English. He did not know English. The fault lies with his translators.

As to your claim:

WeiHan said:
Arctic sea ice extent for May 2015 averaged 12.65 million square kilometers (4.88 million square miles), the third lowest May ice extent in the satellite record. This is 730,000 square kilometers (282,000 square miles) below the 1981 to 2010 long-term average of 13.38 million square kilometers (5.17 million square miles) and 70,000 square kilometers (27,000 square miles) above the record low for the month, observed in 2004.

Malcolm wrote:

WeiHan said:
Sea ice in the Arctic Ocean is at its lowest May level since records began in the 1980s.
Ice coverage around the North Pole is currently just 11.32m sq km, compared with a 30 year average of 12.5m sq km.
This figure is even lower than the 11.89m sq km of 2012, when sea ice coverage reached its lowest summer time level. Ice extent generally reaches its lowest level in mid September. In 2012 there were just 3.2m sq km of sea ice in the Arctic.
Arctic sea ice decreased at a rate of around four percent per decade between 1978 and 1996, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The IPCC expects the extent of sea ice to decrease by 20 percent by 2050, with some ice-free summers by the same time.
Melting sea ice does not affect sea levels but it does affect the amount of heat that is absorbed. Typically sea ice reflects between 50 and 70 percent of incoming solar radiation, compared with just seven to 10 percent by ocean water.
This is likely to result in accelerating warming in the Arctic, which in turn, raises the likelihood of accelerating ice loss – a negative feedback.
A loss of sea ice reduces the protection afforded to coastal regions and is expected to result in higher waves and an increase in storm surges, inundation and coastal erosion.
The loss of sea ice does have some benefits; previously inaccessible shipping routes will become open to commercial traffic.
For example, voyage times between Rotterdam, Netherlands and Yokohama, Japan, would be reduced by 40 percent using this Northern Sea Route compared with the conventional route through the Suez Canal.
It is uncertain whether this year’s rapid decrease in coverage will be maintained, but warm air over Canada and Alaska is expected to move across the North Pole in the coming week.
The melting of surface ice sets up melt ponds which absorb heat and make the acceleration of ice loss much more likely.

Your perception of a snake, and reacting to it viscerally is still 2 and 3. 2 and 3 are mental factors also, but because they have such a strong role in samsara, they are treated as separate aggregates.

See.

Data released showed that "global warming" stopped 16 years ago. The graphs even show that it is cyclical.

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/ ... ve-it.html
So their model is predicting a continuous increase of surface temperature but yet temperature has stalled for 16 years and they have to come up with a cycle theory to patch up an explanation. What does it says? Bottom line, even for a novice that didn't read up their explanation, you should be able to conclude that the model that they have been relying on is inaccurate.
The linear trend from August 1997 (in the middle of an exceptionally strong El Nino) to August 2012 (coming at the tail end of a double-dip La Nina) is about 0.03°C/decade, amounting to a temperature increase of 0.05°C over that period, but equally we could calculate the linear trend from 1999, during the subsequent La Nina, and show a more substantial warming.
As we’ve stressed before, choosing a starting or end point on short-term scales can be very misleading. Climate change can only be detected from multi-decadal timescales due to the inherent variability in the climate system. If you use a longer period from HadCRUT4 the trend looks very different. For example, 1979 to 2011 shows 0.16°C/decade (or 0.15°C/decade in the NCDC dataset, 0.16°C/decade in GISS). Looking at successive decades over this period, each decade was warmer than the previous – so the 1990s were warmer than the 1980s, and the 2000s were warmer than both. Eight of the top ten warmest years have occurred in the last decade.

Hi Malcolm and Johnny,

The problem is that since I've started practicing, these afflictive states have been stronger, more and prolonged. Before, there was not much tension/swinging emotions/delusions, maybe it's because I am trying to observe and not let anything manifest in my mind (and/or) letting it manifest but not reacting to it.

I guess I am afraid of creating future suffering through my afflictive states because once I have thought something bad, I am already creating bad karma. The biggest hindrance to this is my self-deception, ego, and self-centeredness. How can I be more honest and sincere in accepting my mistakes and faults?

Thank you Malcolm for answering my post.  I'm still confused as to how it is "miserable compassion" to not engage in meat eating.  I've never heard him specify that it's okay for practitioners of the lower tantras to be vegetarians.  In fact, at the teaching in LA he became red faced and angry and it appeared to me that he slammed his fist down in denouncing vegetarians, he didn't specify as to which practitioners could still be vegetarians. He never mentioned any scriptural reference or commentarial reference to back up this statement. Do you know of any?  I have no doubt that Norbu is an enlightened being, it's just that his statements run counter to statements by Chatral Rinpoche and other Dzogchen masters. I thought as Buddhists we were supposed to do no harm.  I'm just a blue collar guy in rural Northern California and this really has my head spinning.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, the famous one that ChNN always quotes from the Hevajra Tantra (though you won't find it in the extant two chapter version)
Those with compassion eat meat;
those with samaya drink alcohol.
The Hevajra also observes that one should not distinguish between pure foods (i.e. acceptable to Brahmins) and impure foods.

Then in a treasure of Kunzang Dechen Lingpa connected with six dimensions of Samantabhadra mantra (འ་ཨ་ཧ་ཤ་ས་མ), it is said:
If yogins who possess great compassion cannot help but accept meat and blood, that should be considered to be the flesh and blood is a sentient being that is actually present...Yogins who have created bodhicitta, there is nothing more profound than this to benefit migrating beings! For example, there isn’t anyway to guide sentient beings who have no connections. As in the aforementioned example, likewise after flesh and blood is enjoyed in a feast, their minds are purified and sent up [into the dharmadhātu].  All my lineage of followers should practice this in earnest, bringing benefit both to themselves and others.

In Tibetan Buddhism, as anywhere else, success is rewarded with accolade and failure is rewarded with obscurity, and it really has very little to do with puritan notions of authenticity, as much as we may wish it to be otherwise.
"Authenticity" is actually something to be valued, if the lineages are not to decline, long-term. This is not to say that the Tibetans had their act together on this matter all the time.

Malcolm wrote:
You are completely missing my point. My first point is that no one's qualifications to be a teacher has ever been established or refuted on a board such as Dharmawheel, and so on. My second point is that as long as someone can get some Tibetan to vouch for them, it is very difficult to make an argument that someone is an "inauthentic" teacher.

Those of us who have studied the actual history of Tibetan Buddhism, such as yourself, should understand that charges of charlatanism are quite wide spread among all four schools. We should also understand that charges of charlatanism have never ever prevented anyone from gathering students, building monasteries, funding stupas, statues, pujas, shedras and so on. The Shugden affair should prove that much to everyone. Do most of us here regard Shugden as inauthentic? Yes? Do most of us here regard teachers who promulgate this practice as inauthentic? Yes. Does that stop Shugdenpas in the slightest? No! The same thing applies to Michael Roach, and other "controversial" teachers.

Truly, the people who loose the most in this game of authenticity are the self-appointed purveyors of imagined authenticity. In order to question the authenticity of another teacher, first one must prove that one is in fact an arbiter of such authenticity. None of us here can do this. Because of this, accusing this women of being a fraud or a charlatan is a losing game. It is also unfair, and even sexist.

Honestly, the best practice is that when someone you know personally approaches you in private about this or that teachers credentials, then you can give your opinion — but making a public spectacle out of someone who is regarded as a teacher by others is simple bad form. I know, because I have been involved in this practice in the past and now regard it as folly.

You will recall that even Chogyur Lingpa in the beginning was derided as a charlatan. It was mainly due to his association with Khyentse Wangpo that his revelations were found acceptable.

Death, impermanence, karma,etc..seemed to make complete sense before and I felt very inspired and confident, fearless, courageous, and uplifted like I had really found something profound that had stripped all the earlier notions I had about life/this world. But now, it's as if I have forgotten everything and the earlier renunciation seems to have faded, and I don't sense much urgency like before.

What can I do if I relapse with my practice? I feel so guilty, ashamed, and can't shake out the self-hate and self-blaming when I wasn't practicing mentally very well throughout the day. My anger and aggression keeps coming up and it completely overwhelms me that I end up mentally thinking bad things about others, hating them, blaming them and then I regret it and keep going round and round in circles. When I get angry at my friends and family, since I've harmed them, I can't shake out the anger, guilt, blame, and hate towards myself. Also, the most saddest thing is my self-deception, "oh it's ok, I can try even harder and purify next time even if I have gotten angry at someone..."

Right, there are all kinds of Sufis. Some make the Taliban look like liberals.

My point still stands, however. If someone's refuge is Buddha, Dharma Sangha, then they are Buddhist — but if not, then not.

My knowledge of Sufism is limited to Mystical Dimensions of Islam.

I'm not going to debate whether she is really a Buddhist.

That would take getting into the theology and ontology of her school of Sufism and how she reconciled her native Sufi practice and upbringing with the dharma.  That's not my voice.  That said, in the time she tutored me in her tradition, there was nothing that contradicted the four seals of the dharma.

It's also something I categorically won't do: police people's refuge.
Sure.  It' still weird to me though...

I hadn't thought of any of this stuff in years and years and years.

I guess it's my karma to be introduced to compassion to animals, vegetarianism, etc., from an observant muslim woman.  Forever screwed to have have a perspective one can meaningfully share with others...

The answer is no. Neither of those two worldly traditions will bring anyone even within the vicinity of true awakening, let alone near it — so how can they be upāyas?

That's a an unwieldy proposition - not disagreeing, but there are too many component parts - so I propose setting this aside for the time being at least.

Earlier you said:
A means used to bring people to the definitive meaning which is the Buddha, i.e. the state of total awakening.
An upāya is something used to introduce someone to the path.
Was this narrowing of scope intentional?

People cannot be brought to the definitive meaning without being introduced to the path.

Sidebar: This is a really good example of how strange I find this forum.  I made a posting about whether anyone knew any muslims or had been to any Islamic cultural events, and a few posts later I'm defending whether I'd eat a halal kabob.

I am the only one that vote NO. There is no global warming. It is a hoax created by corrupted politicians and quack scientists so that they can leverage more tax money to support their further corruption.

The plot of the average earth temperature with that of the activities of the Sun shows that it swing up and down in phase with the activities of the sun. In other words, temperature of earth moves in cycle and corelates more with the cycle of the activities of the Sun than anything else.

Anthropogenic global warming is the scientific consensus, whether you like it or not.

WeiHan said:
Climate-warming trends over the past century are very likely due to human activities. In addition, most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. The following is a partial list of these organizations, along with links to their published statements and a selection of related resources.

Malcolm wrote:

Here is a list of the all the scientific organizations that consent to that position:

So you are really going to go out on a limb and say that all of these scientific organizations made up of "quacks?"

Are means which draw a person closer to total awakening yet not completely, not upaya?

Malcolm wrote:
The question you ought to asking yourself is whether the two worldly traditions you have identified as "upāya" will draw a person anywhere even within the vicinity of total awakening, let alone near it.
