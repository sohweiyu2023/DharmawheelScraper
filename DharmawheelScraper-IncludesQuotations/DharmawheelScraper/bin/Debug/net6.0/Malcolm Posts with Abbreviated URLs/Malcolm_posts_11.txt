The reason for the turn to identity politics to begin with is that after the white labor movement secured their interest following WWII, they abandoned the rest of the working class (blacks, latinos, etc.) completely, whereas before, what they did was ensure blacks, latinos, and so on were just a marginal force.

This is why I completely laugh at white men who spend their time bitching and moaning about identity politics and fantasizing about a return to color-blind class based labor movements (which never existed).

I'm pretty sure Rinpoche said Begtse Chen was a supramundane (enlightened) protector.

Good question. All I could gather from Rinpoche, is that adoption of Begtse began between the reign of the 2-3 Dalai Lamas, that Chamsing and Nechung are of one-nature, and that Chamsing (supramundane) is uncommon aspect and Nechung mundane?

Chamsing is one of the chief dharma protectors of Tamdrin Yangsang's mandala and is mentioned/invoked in FPMT's protector practices.

One (controversial) source lists him as a wisdom/enlightened protector along side Kalarupa, Palden Lhamo, and Six-armed Mahakala. Also, says he originally had Indian roots and came to Tibet beginning 11th century through Sakya/Kagyu via Marpa and Sachen Kunga Nyingpo?

I was a bit unsure on the first point I think Rinpoche was just saying that the titles "black and red" protectors depends on the context. The Tibetan government mean Palden Lhamo and Nechung, whereas in Mongolia it refers to Palden Lhamo and Begtse Chen.

I don't defend ontological idealism either like neo-Advaitins. This is a category error. I'm simply forwarding epistemological idealism--- we don't really know what lies beyond mind. Failing to distinguish the two is problematic.

Malcolm wrote:
When it comes to the basis, the perception of ordinary beings, Madhyamaka in general does not forward epistemological idealism. Sapan summarizes this quite well:

Matt J said:
With the intent of functioning in common with worldlings,
he that external objects exist,
but having in mind the reasoning
that investigates conventional reality,
he taught that phenomena are mind.
Again, having in mind ultimate reality,
he that that all phenomena are elaborationless.

Malcolm wrote:
So, it really all depends on whether what perspective you are addressing things from. The Gelug POV always takes into consideration common mundane convention as the baseline for discussion. But even they, when it comes to meditating the path in Vajrayāna, consider phenomena to be mind, and ultimately, free of proliferation.

What Gorampa, and later Mipham, are criticizing the Gelug point of view for, is granting an undue existential status that is not required at all to explain the conventional truth of ordinary persons, that is, the point of view of people who have not analyzed anything. Relative truth does not bear ultimate analysis, but on the other hand, claiming we cannot known anything of the world beyond our five senses is also not an argument that any Mādhyamika would seriously propose, since even Mādhyamikas admit that a sense consciousness will not arise in absence of a sense object, and that the two truths are objects of true and false cognitions. For example, Aryadeva clearly states:

Dependent on eye and form, 
the mind arises like an illusion,
it is not reasonable to call
illusory that which has existence.

Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas, Sonam, Snow Lion, 1994, pg. 261.

This verse itself is sufficient to show that Mādhyamikas accept outer objects conventionally.

But if such views encourage beings... who am I to argue?

Malcolm wrote:
This are the three main passages that Phakpa explains. First, in order to point out that he was teaching myriad bodhisattvas in the ocean:

As soon as Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta said those words, many thousands of lotuses rose up into the sky from within the oceans. Many thousands of bodhisattvas were seated upon those lotuses. Then those bodhisattvas came through the sky to Vulture Peak and remained suspended in the sky above it. Mañjuśrī Kumārabhūta had guided all of them toward the highest, complete enlightenment. Those bodhisattvas who had previously entered the Mahāyāna praised the six perfections and the qualities of the Mahāyāna, while the bodhisattvas who had previously been śrāvakas praised the Śrāvakayāna. All of them knew the qualities of the Mahāyāna and the emptiness of all phenomena.

Then, the qualities of Sāgara's daughter, as we already discussed, are qualities of a tenth stage bodhisattva described at length in various sūtras, of those, these are included.

The daughter of Sāgara, king of the nāgas, said, “Venerable Śāriputra, if I have great miraculous power, I will attain the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood even more quickly than that jewel was accepted.”

And:

That bodhisattva now went to the south and, in a southern world realm named Vimalā, manifested the attainment of perfect buddhahood while seated at the foot of a tree made of the seven precious materials.

Note, the future tense, "I will" and then the actual statement "manifested".

As mentioned above, a tenth stage bodhisattva has the power to demonstrate any form to any being to be tamed.

This raises the question, when does buddhahood begin? We have an answer, actually. According to Maitreyanātha, buddhahood begins on the tenth bhumi, as he says, because the gnosis beyond the ninth bhumi is the gnosis of a buddha. So, the "sudden awakening" of the daughter of Sāgara is just another one of your favorite things, it's an upaya, but that does not mean it ought to be taken literally.

Malcolm wrote:
No, definitely not. In fact, the Chogyal Phakpa, fifth founder master of Sakya, has a text specifically aimed at addressing misconceptions about the Nāgā princess tale. He was the imperial preceptor to Kublai Khan, was fluent in Chinese, and interacted daily with the Chinese Buddhists.

He addresses your contention that she was able to traverse the entire path in eight years, soup to nuts. According to him, the Lotus itself shows that the retinue of nāgās were not ordinary trainees who had never entered the path and that there was no training in method. Why? Those nāgās had previously entered Mahāyāna as evidenced by the fact that they praised the qualities of Mahāyāna and the six perfections. Chogyal Phagpa contends that the nāga girl was an tenth stage bodhisattva in fact, from birth, based on the passage, "She has great wisdom, sharp faculties. The actions of her body, speech, and mind are preceded by wisdom..." He claims all these are qualities of a tenth stage bodhisattva, and cites the Sutrālaṃkāra in support of this. Specifically he cites power over the doors of dhāraṇi as being a quality only of tenth stage bodhisattvas. He then defines how long it takes to attain that stage. It takes one uncountable eon to reach the first stage. A second to reach the eighth stage. At that time, one attains patience to the nonarising of dharmas and receives a prediction of buddhahood by the buddhas. It takes a third incalculable eon to attain unsurpassed buddhahood.

He points out that the full awakening of a tenth bodhisattva is not an instant awakening without traversing the paths and stages, but is in fact the conclusion of the ordinary progress of a bodhisattva. Further, he also points that she, as a tenth stage bodhisattva, was an emanation, that as an ordinary women with karmic obscurations, she could not attain the tenth bhumi. As one who was irreversible and had realized the gnosis of the tenth stage, the nāgā princess was an emanation of a tenth stage bodhisattva, which was revealed by her transformation into a male, her actual form. He further asserts her buddhahood in the southern world system was an emanational act of a tenth stage bodhisattva, rather than the attainment of buddhahood. Again, based on the sūtra's actual words, he claims the texts reads that she exhibited buddhahood to all, not that she was a buddha, pointing out that exhibiting full buddhahood and emanating a buddha kāya, including all the deeds of a buddha, such as residing Tuṣita, conception up through parinirvana, are among the listed powers of a tenth stage bodhisattva such as Avalokiteśvara, etc., as explained in the Sutra of the Ten stages.

Chogyal Phakpa, when setting out the intention of this sūtra, agrees it is a definitive sūtra, but for entirely different reasons. He says the intent of this sūtra is, ""Since all phenomena are of one taste and all vehicles are accomplished in a single vehicle, the Sūtra of the White Lotus of the Sublime Dharma was produced to show that the result is of one taste in the ocean of gnosis of Tathāgata," and so on.

So, a very different perspective.

The common perceptual object is liquid. How it appears to beings in the six realms is a mere appearance for the mind of a sentient being in one of the six realms. However, the point here is that there is a common perceptual object.

Matt J said:
This is exactly the position that Mipham negates. He also negates the idea that there are degrees of emptiness or existence, or that there is a separation between emptiness and appearances.

Malcolm wrote:
He is just negating what Gorampa has already negated: in other words, the appearance of liquid in the human realm is invalid in the preta realm. Calling liquid a common perceptual object is merely a convention to conform to the fact that different beings perceive liquids. It does mean that one is asserting some really existing common perceptual object.

And of course, there are no degrees of existence or emptiness, nor is there a separation between appearance and emptiness. No one suggested there was.

Matt J said:
Illusions are perceptual objects. How can there be an illusion without the sticks, mud, paper, mantra of the illusionist?
Interestingly, in his explanations in the autocommentary to the Sems nyid ngal gso (212: 3-223:4), he says phenomenon are "hallucinatory appearances produced by the mind's habitual tendencies." (Trans Padmakara Trans Group) and then references phlegmatic seeing hairs in the sky. No mud necessary.

Malcolm wrote:
This is only one of the eight examples. One can only understand them by using all eight.

As I have pointed out to you before, specifically, Longchenpa rejects that idea that, conventionally-speaking, there are no outer objects. This is well known. He summarizes a long complex argument about illusionists, mountains, and dead people and so on, with this statement, "That appearance for that deceased is no more, but because the cessation of the outer play cannot be accepted, and there is a difference between appearances and apparent objects, there is no fault and it is valid." He then cites Samadhirāja sūtra to the effect that everything is just a designation.

So, positing a common perceptual object is just a designation; likewise the liquid, likewise the water. Likewise the moon in the water. These things are neither true nor false, as Jetsun Drakpa Gyaltsen points out:

Matt J said:
The moon in the water is not the moon in the sky,
but without the latter the former will not appear.
Similarly, the nature of all things
is taught in the two truth.
There are no dharmas
not included in the two truths.
Because the nature is not true and not false,
grasping to the two truths is deluded.

Malcolm wrote:
It is a fools errand to try and prove that there are no outer objects. The very endeavor itself proves that there are, just as in absence of water there is no reflection of the moon, and in absence of the moon, there is no reflection either. As Chandra points out:

Empty things, reflections and the like,
dependent on conditions, are not imperceptible.
And just as empty forms reflected in a glass
create a consciousness in aspect similar,
so all things, though empty, 
strongly manifest within their very emptiness,
and since inherent nature is in neither truth,
phenomena are neither nothing nor unchanging entities.

Malcolm wrote:
Mipham is criticizing here Tsongkhapa's assertion that the common perceptual object is composed of six parts, making it possible for it to appear as six different entities to six different kinds of sentient beings.

All we need to know is that, conventionally speaking, there are common perceptual objects. Even Mipham cannot avoid using the term "object" as the basis for a mental appearance. Why? Because it is incoherent to posit the arising of a sense consciousness in absence of a sense organ and a sense object. Hence nothing in the triad exists from its own side.

Matt J said:
However, it is unclear how a non-existent object can appear absent a mind.

Malcolm wrote:
A nonexistent object cannot appear at all, for example, the child of a barren women or the horns of a hare. An existent object can certainly appear, such as liquid to the sentient beings of the six realms, without having to posit that existence as anything more than a convention. Certainly, one cannot establish such an object ultimately, but on the other hand, one cannot speak of the emptiness of a nonexistent, such as the child of a barren women either. Thus appearances are neither true, nor are they false, just like the moon in the water. Without the moon reflected in the water, an appearance of the moon in the water cannot exist, and thus a mind in which the moon in the water appears cannot exist. The mind in which the moon appears to be reflected in the water cannot exist before the moon is reflected in the water, nor after. The mind in which the moon appears to be reflected in the water can exist only while it is apprehending the moon reflected in the water. When the moon is no longer reflected in the water, the mind in which the moon reflected in the water appears ceases.

Nothing exists from its own side. Objects are not primary, nor are minds. They are mutually dependent, therefore, neither are established in truth, and all is conventional. This is the meaning of arising from conditions.

An appearance indeed belongs to a mind; but an apparent object does not (as Longchenpa shows in both chapter 8 and chapter 12 of his commentary on the Treasury of the Dharmdhātu).

Saying that neither appearances nor apparent objects exist from their own side does not entail that that both exist from the mind's side. The mind itself does not exist from its own side.

Q: Could you talk about the relationship between purification and blessing?

A: These two--purification and receiving blessings--are distinct. They are not exactly the same. Purification means that the obscurations--the cognitive obscurations, which is ignorance, and the afflictive obscurations, which are the mental afflictions and the karmic obscurations or the negative karma that you have accumulated--are gradually purified, which means removed from you. And receiving blessing means that through your supplication of the Buddhas or of the Dharma, you receive their blessing. For example, when you supplicate the Medicine Buddha, through the power of you own supplication combined with the power of the twelve aspirations made by the Medicine Buddha, something happens, and that is called blessing. On the other hand, while purification and blessing are distinct, either one can cause the other. The removal of obscurations allows you to receive the blessings (more fully) and receiving blessings brings about the removal of obscurations.

II. I. The Period In Which No Buddha Exists
Paccekabuddhas are said to exist only in periods when there are no Buddhas. “A person realises Paccekabodhi only when reborn at a time when there is no Buddha” (S-a III 189 and 208). Other expressions to denote this period are: ”the time which lies between (the appearances of) a Lord” (A-a I 194); ”a period in which no Teacher has appeared” (Pv-a III 144); and “the period between the Buddha (-periods)” (A-a II 192). One of the main characteristics of the Paccekabuddha’s career is that he attains insight during such a period. But this does not mean that his whole aspiration to enlightenment is restricted to this time; it is invariably a matter of many existences of hard work, during which he practises the perfections and accumulates the conditions for enlightenment.

When we encounter the power of the Dharma, we start to feel faith, and then we  become diligent. We feel love and compassion, and we develop tranquility and insight. This is what blessings are. They are the absence of  greed, aversion, and delusion. If we can entirely rid ourselves of those three things right away, that is wonderful, but even if not, we can  decrease and suppress them. That is blessings.'

It is also quite possible that there weren't, and later Gelug Mahamudra masters (such as CG) moved a little from TK's explicit position.

Since what's at stake here is the question of what might have been transmitted but not written - i.e. the possibility of an ear whispered lineage - neither Tsong Khapa's own writing, nor Gorampa's refutation of that really count as evidence. The same problem also applies to Pabhongkha, except that it is deepened, given that he existed many centuries later.

One needs to examine the Gelug Mahamudra texts, such as Highway of the Conquerors, and ask: what connections (if any) exist between those statements and Tsong Khapa? And people arrive at different conclusions from that task.

Malcolm wrote:
Considering that Pabhongkha is considered to the main person who transmitted the Ganden Mahāmudrā tradition in the last century to the present generation, and since he explicitly writes that Tsongkhapa rejected introductions, using this as a precedent for excluding the introduction to dharmatā that is part of the Sakyapa Naro Khachö system, I'd say we can definitely accept his opinion.

On the face of it, the Ganden Mahāmudra is little different than the other Mahāmudra systems in Tibet that trace their origin to Saraha. The Panchen Lama calls it "sutra mahāmudra" ostensibly because he is not requiring an empowerment, but the instructions themselves are virtually identical to such texts as "In Front of the Stupa" in Sakya, differing only in that some empowerment is required to practice the former. Also, recall, Ganden Mahāmudra provoked considerable controversy in the beginning, since up to that point the Gelukpas pretty consistently followed Sapan's rejection of so-called sūtra mahāmudra, and it even annoyed the Great Fifth, who was involved in an actual war with the Karma Kagyu school.

There is also the fact that you and I may mean different things by "introduction."

What I am referring to is that fact that subitist* tendencies are quite pronounced in Chinese Buddhism, because of the embrace of TG; whereas they are quite suppressed and reigned in Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, where the TG has, with difficulty, been absorbed. The reason for this clearly is the absence of Indian influence on the one hand, and its presence on the other. Even the schools that embrace wholeheartedly the TG doctrine in Tibet are still gradualist in orientation. And most Tibetan Buddhist scholars (but not all), historically, have not paid much attention to the TG doctrine, other than polemically, and as at best a provisional teaching. And this again has everything to do with what some Indian dudes thought.

*Subitism: The application of the term "subitism" to Buddhism is derived from the French illumination subite (sudden awakening), contrasting with 'illumination graduelle' (gradual awakening). It gained currency in this use in English from the work of sinologist Paul Demiéville. His 1947 work 'Mirror of the Mind' was widely read in the U.S. It inaugurated a series by him on subitism and gradualism.[web 1][5]

To my knowledge, he never identified as A Kagyu, though he certainly had Kagyu teachers.

Samantabhadra as a name of the dharmakȳa occurs 10 times in the Guhasamāja; Vajradhara, 14 times.

Also both names appear in the Mañjuśrīnamasamgiti.

The name Samantbhadra also appears Sandhivyakarana explanatory tantra:

Vajradhara, as depicted in Sakya and Geluk, demonstrates the so-called seven limbs of the three kāyas, which is the result of the fourth empowerment and represents realization of mahāmudrā. The source of this presentation is the Jñānavajrasammucaya Tantra.

The simplest way to explains this is that the limb of the dharmakāya is naturelessness, or lack of inherent existence (rang bzhin med pa); the three limbs of the sambhogakāya are complete enjoyment, union, and great bliss; and the three limbs of the nirmanakāya are being filled with compassion, not being interrupted, and never ceasing. Sometimes the limbs of not being interrupted or ceasing is placed with the dharmakāya.

There is no "transition" from Samantabhadra to Vajradhara. Samantabhadra is the name given to the dharmakāya in the root tantra of yoga tantra, the Compendium of the Principles of the Tathāgatas as well as the Guhyasamāja Tantra, the root tantra of the so-called father tantras in highest yoga tantra.

Malcolm wrote:
November 24, 2021
Heather Cox Richardson Nov 25

The Biden administration has announced it will convene the first of two virtual “Summits for Democracy” on December 9 and 10, 2021. The gatherings will bring together leaders from 110 countries who work in government, civil society, and the private sector, to come up with an agenda to renew democratic government and work together to keep the ideals of democracy strong.

Authoritarianism is growing around the world, including in America, and the administration is hoping to create practical ideas and strong alliances to defend against authoritarianism, fight corruption, and promote human rights, all values central to democracy.

That this announcement comes at Thanksgiving is fitting, since Thanksgiving is rooted in a defense of democracy during the Civil War.

The Pilgrims and the Wampanoags did indeed share a harvest celebration together at Plymouth in fall 1621, but that moment got forgotten almost immediately, overwritten by the long history of the settlers’ attacks on their Indigenous neighbors.

In 1841, a book that reprinted the early diaries and letters from the Plymouth colony recovered the story of that three-day celebration in which ninety Indigenous Americans and the English settlers shared fowl and deer. This story of peace and goodwill among men who by the 1840s were more often enemies than not inspired Sarah Josepha Hale, who edited the popular women’s magazine Godey’s Lady's Book, to think that a national celebration could ease similar tensions building between the slave-holding South and the free North. She lobbied for legislation to establish a day of national thanksgiving.

And then, on April 12, 1861, southern soldiers fired on Fort Sumter, a federal fort in Charleston Harbor, and the meaning of a holiday for giving thanks changed.

Southern leaders wanted to destroy the United States of America and create their own country, based not in the traditional American idea that “all men are created equal,” but rather in its opposite: that some men were better than others and had the right to enslave their neighbors. In the 1850s, convinced that society worked best if a few wealthy men ran it, southern leaders had bent the laws of the United States to their benefit, using it to protect enslavement above all.

In 1860, northerners elected Abraham Lincoln to the presidency to stop rich southern enslavers from taking over the government and using it to cement their own wealth and power. As soon as he was elected, southern leaders pulled their states out of the Union to set up their own country. After the firing on Fort Sumter, Lincoln and the fledgling Republican Party set out to end the slaveholders’ rebellion.

The early years of the war did not go well for the U.S. By the end of 1862, the armies still held, but people on the home front were losing faith. Leaders recognized the need both to acknowledge the suffering and to keep Americans loyal to the cause. In November and December, seventeen state governors declared state thanksgiving holidays.

New York Governor Edwin Morgan’s widely reprinted proclamation about the holiday reflected that the previous year “is numbered among the dark periods of history, and its sorrowful records are graven on many hearthstones.” But this was nonetheless a time for giving thanks, he wrote, because “the precious blood shed in the cause of our country will hallow and strengthen our love and our reverence for it and its institutions…. Our Government and institutions placed in jeopardy have brought us to a more just appreciation of their value.”

The next year Lincoln got ahead of the state proclamations. On July 15, he declared a national day of Thanksgiving, and the relief in his proclamation was almost palpable. After two years of disasters, the Union army was finally winning. Bloody, yes; battered, yes; but winning. At Gettysburg in early July, Union troops had sent Confederates reeling back southward. Then, on July 4, Vicksburg had finally fallen to U. S. Grant’s army. The military tide was turning.

President Lincoln set Thursday, August 6, 1863, for the national day of Thanksgiving. On that day, ministers across the country listed the signal victories of the U.S. Army and Navy in the past year and reassured their congregations that it was only a matter of time until the United States government put down the southern rebellion. Their predictions acknowledged the dead and reinforced the idea that their sacrifice had not been in vain.

In October 1863, President Lincoln declared a second national day of Thanksgiving. In the past year, he declared, the nation had been blessed.

In the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity, he wrote, Americans had maintained their laws and their institutions and had kept foreign countries from meddling with their nation. They had paid for the war as they went, refusing to permit the destruction to cripple the economy. Instead, as they funded the war, they had also advanced farming, industry, mining, and shipping. Immigrants had poured into the country to replace men lost on the battlefield, and the economy was booming. And Lincoln had recently promised that the government would end slavery once and for all. The country, he predicted, “with a large increase of freedom,” would survive, stronger and more prosperous than ever. The president invited Americans “in every part of the United States, and also those who are at sea, and those who are sojourning in foreign lands” to observe the last Thursday of November as a day of Thanksgiving.

In 1863, November’s last Thursday fell on the 26th. On November 19, Lincoln delivered an address at the dedication of a national cemetery at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. He reached back to the Declaration of Independence for the principles on which he called for Americans to rebuild the severed nation:

​​”Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.”

Lincoln urged the crowd to take up the torch those who fought at Gettysburg had laid down. He called for them to “highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.”

The following year, Lincoln proclaimed another day of Thanksgiving, this time congratulating Americans that God had favored them not only with immigration but also with the emancipation of formerly enslaved people. “Moreover,” Lincoln wrote, “He has been pleased to animate and inspire our minds and hearts with fortitude, courage, and resolution sufficient for the great trial of civil war into which we have been brought by our adherence as a nation to the cause of freedom and humanity, and to afford to us reasonable hopes of an ultimate and happy deliverance from all our dangers and afflictions.”

In 1861, Americans went to war to keep a cabal from taking control of the government and turning it into an oligarchy. The fight against that rebellion seemed at first to be too much for the nation to survive. But Americans rallied and threw their hearts into the cause on the battlefields even as they continued to work on the home front for a government that defended democracy and equality before the law.

And they won.

My best to you all for Thanksgiving 2021.

The terms "awareness" and "consciousness" are English terms. Therefore, one needs to look at the word list of equivalents to see which Sanskrit or Tibetan terms are being used for these two English terms, and their context. At that point, you can make useful comparisons and contrasts.

Even some Tibetan Lamas will incorrectly claim that having bestowed refuge, now the student has samaya with that teacher and so on. I just think it is better to encourage people to receive refuge and bodhisattva vows from qualified lamas, preferably lineage heads, and among those, bhikṣus like HH Dalai Lama are preferable to upasākas. One should recall that among vajramasters, a bhiḳsu with intact vows is supreme, according to Kalacakra. On the other hand, though this is ideal, life is short, and if one does not want to use the rite of administering refuge and bodhisattva vows to oneself, then any qualified teacher who is willing to give them will do.

I was thinking more in general terms of "preliminaries" and assumed the question was asked in that regard, not in the technical sense of being or not being Lamrim literature formally.

If we are doing that then for I think for Sakya it's maybe Clarifying the Sage Intent, but IMO it's tougher reading than the others.

Malcolm wrote:
Technically, Sapan and Gampopa's texts are "stages of the doctrine" (bstan rim) rather than "stages of the path" (lam rim).

The former are based on Maitreya's Ornament of Mahāyāna Sutras, which begin with the discussion of gotra, or inclination for awakening and conclude with a discussion of the three kāyas. The latter are based on Atisha's Lamp of the Path of Awakening, begins with a discussion of the qualities of the teacher and conclude with a discussion of śamatha and vipaśyāna and the desirability of practicing Vajrayāna.  This is how one discerns the distinction between these two genres of texts.

OK. I intended it [mod note: the quote from Dhammapada - https://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.p ... 61#p608961] as an answer that it is your own self who attains Refuge by realizing the Four noble truths, i.e. by following and realizing the Dharma. According to Buddha any member of the Sangha can teach you the Dharma. In the Sravakayana sutras even a laywoman can act as a teacher, as in the case of the lay-woman Visakha, who converted her father-in-law, wealthy merchant Migara, into Buddhism. Thereafter she was called "Migara's mother", being his "mother" in the spiritual sense, because she had caused Migara's spiritual birth in Buddhism.

That depends on a number of factors.  You could live on for a reasonable amount of time in a lot of pain with both of those.  If it was a katana, and not a tanto, then by definition you're in combat and not committing seppuku, so there isn't a second waiting to decapitate you before you dishonor yourself by crying out.  Since you're in combat, there's a reasonable chance that your opponent will follow up with a lethal blow pretty quickly.  However with the shotgun, it depends a bit on whether its sawn off or not.  If it is, then it just blows a big hole in you and you probably die as quickly as if disemboweled by a katana. But if it's not sawn off, and the pellets exit the barrel in a spread, you could live in agony for a day or so after the injury - perhaps even survive if you happened to get shot right outside a hospital and weren't hit at close range.  But in any case your assailant is using a two-shot weapon, so it's most likely that they will run away rather than administering a prompt coup de grace.

This is why cross-cultural comparisons are so different, there are so many social factors that are hard to correlate directly.

If I were you I'd just get the text and go for it. I've had a number of Initiations in the Sakya lineage and I've found they are often going to expect you have a basic background of understanding in the Mahayana, which means you might have some confusion initially if you don't. You practice, ask questions, and refine. I was taught that Bodhicitta motivation and genuine enthusiasm are the main factor.

The first few I went to were crazy affairs, monks running around frantically, seemingly everyone but me knew better was what going on, rice flying all over the place, etc. Over the years they came to mean a lot to me and especially now with Covid, I really recall them fondly. I can see that they did much for me, however confusing at the time.

At any rate, if you paid attention for any of it and are attracted to the practice, IMO it is a waste of time to worry much about whether or not you "got it", and you should just do it, but YMMV.

I believe that I remember in one of your older posts, you saying that omniscience doesn’t mean that a Buddha is aware of all things at all times; however that a Buddha could know the number of worms in the ground, if they were to direct their mind towards such....

Malcolm wrote:
Maybe. The definition of Buddha's omniscience does not come from sūtra, it comes from śastra. And it has limits. Strictly speaking it is knowledge of all phenomena. But "all phenomena" simply refers to one aggregate, one sense base, and one sense element. It does not refer to everything in the universe, known and unknown. It refers to that which is one's personal range. Thus, to bring up another contentious point, the Buddha can be "incorrect" (that is to say, bow to conventions of his day) about Meru, but still be entirely correct about the paths and stages. We do not need to ascribe super powers to the Buddha even he didn't claim.

The second point is that killing animals does not violate one's vows of refuge. If it did, it would be a parajika for monks, but it isn't. It is merely an offense requiring confession, without a punishment, like drinking alcohol and damaging plants, and about 88 other acts. The vow not to kill, means not to kill human beings.  The deliberate killing of animals does go against the commitment of training in the Dharma, non-harming, but that is not one of the five vows, it is a commitment than even butchers who go for refuge aspire to. And arguably, farming goes against that commitment as well, hence the reason monastics are forbidden from agricultural work in its entirety. For this reason, Buddhajñānapāda was astonished when he met Mañjuśrīmitra, who was a bhikṣu, the latter was plowing a field, and later came home staggeringly drunk in the evening. Mañjuśrīmitra's wife gutted a fish for their meal, and so on. In other words they lived like many Tibetan lamas do, in robes, behaving like laypeople. Go figure.

So you doubt that ChNN told people who had no thogal transmissions not to read Heartdrops in 1992, at the first Santi Maha Sangha base retreat, which I attended. The fact that CHNN might have asked Adriano to go and study with Loppon Tenzin Namdak as part of Adriano's research in the 80's is quite irrelevant to what ChNN might have said, repeatedly I might add, about people who lack transmission reading thogal texts. He repeatedly has told the tale of the man on the bus in Tibet reading his notes on thogal with chinese guides present. [/quote]

First, I only began to even consider publishing my translations after being repeatedly encouraged to do so by multiple Tibetan lamas. As of 2011, I was pretty sure I would never publish them.


Yes, these editions of my translations are expensive, deliberately so. They are so expensive, I received virtually no royalties from them as they have not even paid for the cost of their printing. I didn't publish them for the money. I published them for practitioners, in the most efficient way possible, through a publisher. If I had wanted to make money I would have self-published them. I chose distribution over money. Of course, I later learned at a conference that when one self-publishes, one more or less commits publishing suicide with Wisdom and and Shambhala. Nikko Odiseos was extremely clear on this point, and another editor at Wisdom, Brianna Quick, was in agreement with him. The other advantage to publishing with a top publishing house is peer-review.
So to your point of people being responsible for themselves, the reason we put such strong warnings in books is that the "restricted" approach does not work. People lie. So the choice is a) either make the books available without imposing restrictions on purchase, Wisdom; or b) impose restrictions on purchase, Shambhala, and have people lie.

Finally, Sapan is quite clear that hearing or reading tantric material—let along trying to practice it—without transmission creates obstacles (Three Codes, pp.100-102). He dismisses as incoherent the concept of "self secrecy (Three Codes, pg. 109).

So of course, you are free, but encouraging people to ignore the clear intent of the tantras is a little strange. Yes, of course translators and publishers are at fault for publishing Vajrayāna material in a public way, but then again, there is a risk benefit analysis, and at this point, the benefits to practitioners clearly outweighs to risk to translators and publishers.

The point though is that he previously interpreted Yogacara as very close to idealist systems such as Berkeley's, and therefore philosophically untenable.

Everything you are talking about is conventional, all experiences are labeled right out the box. That’s why we don’t pay attention to them very much, other than path experiences, which fit a very narrow, phenomenological profile.

But the real point here is “What is going to produce realization of the path of seeing.” For example, the Uttaratantra is entirely descriptive, not prescriptive at all, unlike the other Maitreya texts like Distinguishing the Middle from Extremes, and the Ornament of Mahayana Sutras. The latter is the basis of the presentation of how to practice the Mahayana path for all schools. Most yogacara literature that has come down to us is commentary on this text. Even beyond this, we can understand all this business about tathagatagarbha is purely speculative because only Buddhas can perceive it. We cannot. It is cognitively closed to us, according to tathagatagarbha sutras themselves. So while I appreciate your appeal to meditative experience, you will never experience or perceive tathagatagarbha until you are a Buddha and have realized the dharmakaya. And the consequence of this is that this topic is, from beginning to end, including Karls remarks, total intellectual proliferation with no relevance to anyone’s practice, your’s, mine, or anyone else.

It’s your, and everyone else’s choice on Dharmawheel whether you listen to Patrul Rinpoche and Sapan on this matter, or Malcolm. I’ll stick with the former.

And in truth it is not even clear that gshan stong was really his final view. It's been speculated that since his main sponsors were Kagyus, he was writing for his audience.

Actually, the problem with Tibetans, and I have said this before, is that because Ratnakāraśānti asserted in his Madhyamaka texts that Asanga was a third stage bodhisattva and Nāgārjuna was a first stage bodhisattva, and also the main translator of them, Śantibhadra, was hostile to Candrakīrti's school, there has been a push amongst Tibetans to reconcile the treatises of Maitreya and Nāgarjuna.

Personally, I see no need to reconcile Madhyamaka with Yogacāra, since the former is higher than the latter; and even Karl admits that the gzhan stong approach to the three natures, for example, is not precedented in the Indian traditions from which the gzhan stong school draws its inspiration.

Also the relationship between dharmakāya and ālayavijñāna is discussed in chapter 10 of the MS, pg. 238. The main problem with Yogacāra that everyone points out, is that there is a internal contradiction when one claims something compounded (the ālayavijñāna) transforms into something uncompounded (the dharmakāya).

So it is not that the alayavijnana is a deluded tathagatgarbha, but rather the alayavijnana IS the delusion.

This is one of the problems with tathāgatagarbha theory. You have one sūtra proclaiming it is dharmakāya encased in afflictions; another claiming it is just a name for ālayavijñāna. The Yogacārins, as Karl correctly points out, won't have anything to do with it. And then you have Tibetans with too much time on their hands trying to reconcile all these conflicting doctrines, which do not actually have to be reconciled at all.

This passage is not correctly translated because Higgens mistakes a genitive for an locative:

’o na gnyug ma’i sems ni gang zhe na de ni da ltar rang rgyud kyi tha mal gyi shes

"If it is asked what is the innate mind, that is the ordinary consciousness of one's continuum at this moment."

The distinction between the locative case and the genitive case here is crucial. All this means is that the so-called "innate mind" is the clarity aspect of the all-basis. Also he mistakes for a locative, the dative "da ltar," it is an easy mistake to make in Tibetan since they have the same morphology, and the difference is context driven.

Otherwise, the problem arises of supposing there are two minds.

At that point, all that remains is omniscience, like every other presentation of buddhahood. There are some variations in how that works. Some maintain, Gelukapas mostly, that buddhas need to have conceptual apparatus capable of seeing the faults of sentient beings. Others, Sakya, Nyingmas, etc., negate this, because relative truth is defined from the point of view of sentient beings, and buddhas are free of all obscurations and only have pure vision.

The entire premise of this thread is based on the Brunnhölzl vide linked in the first post. The premise of that video is that Brunnhölzl is responding to the idea that Buddha Nature is, or at least can be, a radical Teaching. He is deliberately responding with what is probably the most outrageous interpretation of Buddha Nature which he credits to both HHK8 and HHK3. So I don't think "error" enters into the equation no matter how much it conflicts with more mainstream thought. That's the point--it's radical!

Malcolm wrote:
If it’s wrong, it is just wrong.  But as I said, I’ll need to look at the text itself. For example, what is KVIII definition here of Buddhanature and so on? As we know, tathagatagarbha has been defined in sutras from the all-basis consciousness to dharmakaya and everything in between.

But as I said, this is not a problem at all. Buddhanature is a provisional doctrine, according to the Uttaratantra itself, taught to eliminate five faults. It is training wheels for baby bodhisattvas who are scared of emptiness.

I doubt very much that Karl is an annihilationist. You have really misunderstood his point, quite grievously. What he and the karmapas are implying is that there never were sentient beings to begin with. This is not controversial. Haribhadra, a Madhyamaka, points out than when one realizes buddhahood, one realizes too there was never a time when one was not a buddha. This insight does not depend on the Buddhanature doctrine at all, since it is straight out of the PP Sutras. Moreover, it is commonly stated that from the point of the view of the result, Buddhas only perceive other Buddhas, they do not perceive sentient beings, because to perceive obscurations would equal being obscured. Buddhas have no obscurations, hence they do not perceive them, ergo, they have no perception of sentient beings at all. Thus is another reason why Haribhadra points out that the path is entirely illusory from beginning to end, including the attainment of buddhahood.

Zhabkar's approach is pragmatic, not dogmatic. He understands that in the Tibetan context, people just are not generally going to live on vegetables, grain, and dairy alone. It is a myth, BTW, that Tibetans could not grow vegetables in Tibet. They grew plenty of things: peas, barely, wheat, etc. They merely selected for things that were could be stored long term, and that excluded fresh vegetables, which require a lot of agricultural resources for a limited return in a cold,  dry alpine climate. And of course, Tibetan diets varied regionally.

Sometimes he did, sometimes he did not. That answer to that is that it is usually practice dependent.

In other places, he strongly discourages people from drinking alcohol and eating meat.

KonchogUrgyenNyima said:
Thanks for this answer Malcolm. That is helpful. This does not address eating meat/drinking beer solely as sustenance. Just in one’s mealtimes. Or am I wrong? Is it that someone practicing tummo should eat some meat/beer with their meals? Or that they should eat it in a ritual setting outside of their sustenance?

Malcolm wrote:
It means they should rely on meat and mild alcohol during meals to keep up their strength and stamina. In general, in Mahāyāna one should avoid meat. But in Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra, the consumption of meat is permitted. Despite this, there is a strong inclination to avoid meat other than in feasts. And as the link between industrial agriculture and climate change has become clear, many Buddhists are steering away from meat because of their conscience.

If one is a serious practitioner of Unsurpassed Yoga Tantra, you can eat meat. But one is not, then it is better to avoid it, apart from feasts.

NAFTA has been around for almost three decades now and despite all the “great sucking sound” rhetoric, there was no group that obviously lost out from it. The border was open for decades before that, agriculture in California and elsewhere has depended on a mobile Mexican workforce for well over half a century.

The problems caused by having an open border have a lot more to do with explicitly illegal actions, eg the demand for drugs in the US and the supply of weapons back into Mexico, the social problems of having a large mobile workforce for the maquiladoras, etc.  The phantasm of Mexican criminals in the US is not really an open border problem.  The US does perfectly well at generating both indigenous criminal gangs and economic inequity without the help of any other country.

I’m not sure that I’m confused about the distinction between consciousness and awareness other than perhaps in mixing up the two terms,  using one term to refer to the other. Both are ambiguous English language words referring to the mental experience of subject-object interaction. Perhaps the Sanskrit terms, clearly defined, would be better to use.

Malcolm wrote:
We have a Sanskrit term we normally use to refer to "consciousness," that is "vijñāna;" not so for the term "awareness."

PadmaVonSamba said:
If, as you say, consciousness + object = awareness
(A+B=C) then one would assume that A and B occur prior to their interaction. It seems as though your argument is that neither occur until they interact: there is no A until there is B (and vice-versa). I am familiar with this view, but I would like it explained better.

Malcolm wrote:
No, sense organ (A) plus object (B) gives rise to a sense consciousness (C). Of course there are problems with this basic scheme of the Sarvastivadins, but we take it as a base line, since it is the scheme the Buddha taught as the eighteen sense elements.

PadmaVonSamba said:
Another issue I have with the argument that contact relies on sense-faculties is that there are many examples of living organisms which demonstrate intentional interactions with objects in their external environments, but which, themselves, do not possess brains or sense organs. The simplest example is that of a spermatozoa which is “attracted” by the chemicals given off by the ovum, and swims towards it.

Malcolm wrote:
That is not intentional action, since a spermatozoa has no mind.

However, cetana, volition/intention is a mental factor that arises with all minds in the desire realm, it is one of the ten neutral mental factors.

PadmaVonSamba said:
But there are other examples involving simple yet more complex organisms, certain types of jellyfish, and I think, for example, those microscopic manatee-looking things that supposedly live on the surface of one’s eyelashes.

Malcolm wrote:
In order to have intentions, one must have a mind.

PadmaVonSamba said:
What about the being who is in the bardo, said to be attracted to its future parents? Does it have eye consciousness? Does it possess awareness of the various visions and lights in the bardo? If it does, then by what means is this possible since it has no organ of sight, if not for some kind of innate awareness?

Malcolm wrote:
Bardo beings have complete sense organs and aggregates, according to Abhidharma. What they are unable to see is the sun and moon, since they are apparitionally-born, lacking the solar and lunar elements on their bodies from a female and a male, thus the explanation goes.

PadmaVonSamba said:
BTW, when I said that awareness is “absolute” (and perhaps the word, “consciousness” would have been the correct term) I meant that nobody can deny that it is happening, because to even deny it requires awareness of that denial.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, when we investigated our minds, even though we cannot find anything, we cannot deny there is looking. This is generally termed gsal rig, clear and knowing, and is the characteristic of the mind. The essence of the mind is emptiness.

The nature of the mind has three aspects, it is clear, knowing, and empty. Clarity and knowing are somethings collapsed for convenience into clarity, to make it easier to map the resultant three kāyas to the causal nature of the mind.

In both Dzogchen and Mahāmudra meditation, one first identifies the clarity aspect by looking for the mind, when it is not found, this is called "sealing clarity with emptiness." When one concludes that despite not being able to find anything, one cannot deny there is an act of looking for the mind, this is called sealing "emptiness with clarity." When one is able to rest in the clear and empty nature of the mind without tending to one side or the other, this is called "sealing inseparability with inseparability."

If there is anything absolute about the nature of the mind, it is the inseparability of clarity and emptiness, which itself is uncompounded, naturally perfected, nonarising, beginningless, and unceasing.

Isn't the border de facto open anyway? Why not legalize crossing, then you can regulate it. Sort of like the argument for drugs, I guess.

One of the first free trade experiments in the world was Benelux, Belgium - Luxembourg - Netherlands. After a few years of open borders and free trade, although a number of businesses had been wiped out in a flurry of creative destruction as tariffs and protective measures fell away, overall trade increased, and the economy surged, way above the European average.

This proved that open borders creates an intensification of business due to the free flow of goods and services.

Kim O'Hara said:
(1) One example is not proof of any general rule.
(2) What's 'good for business' is not necessarily good for people, e.g. industries move off-shore where workers can be freely exploited, putting workers back home out of their jobs. Closed borders may, on the whole, be better.

NAFTA has been around for almost three decades now and despite all the “great sucking sound” rhetoric, there was no group that obviously lost out from it. The border was open for decades before that, agriculture in California and elsewhere has depended on a mobile Mexican workforce for well over half a century.

The problems caused by having an open border have a lot more to do with explicitly illegal actions, eg the demand for drugs in the US and the supply of weapons back into Mexico, the social problems of having a large mobile workforce for the maquiladoras, etc.  The phantasm of Mexican criminals in the US is not really an open border problem.  The US does perfectly well at generating both indigenous criminal gangs and economic inequity without the help of any other country.

Malcolm wrote:

The idea that there can be awakening without analytical insight, aka, vipaśyanā, has been rejected in Tibetan Buddhism since the eighth century.

Evidence shows that samadhi is not necessary for awakening at all, actually, as we see from the large number of people who attained stream entry and even arhatship through what is called dry vipaśyanā. Certainly samadhi, aka śamatha, aka calm-abiding can help stabilize the mind, thus making insight more stable, but the crucial factor in awakening, achieving the path of seeing, is in sight, not samadhi.

Just as a bird needs two wings to fly, generally speaking a practitioner needs both wisdom (prajñā) and method (upaya); vipaśyāna and śamatha in union.

The dharma has very precise language with which we discuss the mind and its functions. It's called abhidharma. If people do not ground their discussions of dharma in vinaya, sūtra, or abhidharma, they are just making shit up.

If anything, what people are here calling "awareness" is either samjñā, perception, the third skandha; or manaskāra, attention, which is a mental factor. Well, they are both mental factors, but the reason "perception" gets it own skandha is that it is one of two mental factors that pull us most strongly towards afflictive objects. The other being vedana, sensation.,

Good to know. What are the Sanskrit and Tibetan terms for awareness-consciousness?

Malcolm wrote:
Rig pa, often translated as awareness, derives from Sanskrit, vid: knowing , understanding , a knower.

Rnam shes is generally a translation of vijñāna, the aggregate of consciousness, or one of the six senses consciousnesses.

Shes pa is generally a translation of jñā, to know , have knowledge , become acquainted with (acc. ; rarely gen. MBh. iii , 2154 Hariv. 7095) , perceive , apprehend , understand (also with inf. [Pa1n2. 3-4 , 65] MBh. ii , v Das3.) , experience , recognise , ascertain , investigate RV. &c. ; to know as , know or perceive that. This generally, in Tibetan texts, refers the five sense consciousnesses.

The usage of the term rig pa in Kagyu and Sakya texts is more straightforward, where it refers the knowing aspect of the all-basis.

In Dzogchen texts it is a much more complicated term. However, it has in general two interrelated meanings: the first is knowledge of the basis, that is, recognition of nature of the mind. Secondly, it refers to abiding in the nature of consciousness itself. Teacher like MIgyur Dorje and so on, and most modern translators working in Dzogchen material, tend to have taken up Herbert Guenther's early translation of rig pa as "awareness." Chogyal Namkhai Norbu coined the term "instant presence."

Yes, emptiness is unconditioned since it does not arise. But it still isn't anything at all.

You see, there are only four unconditioned things in Buddhism: space and the two kinds of cessation: analytical cessation (nirvana), non-analytical cessation (simple absence of causation), and emptiness. But emptiness and nirvana are synonyms.

The perfection of wisdom states three things, which are all synonymous: all things are empty. All things are nonarisen. All things have always been in a state of nirvana. This means that nature of all things is that they are unconditioned. Everything that seems conditioned, is in reality, unconditioned. But that unconditioned state is still a negation. That's why it isn't anything at all. The unconditioned is not even unconditioned because there isn't anything to be unconditioned, since by definition, the unconditioned never arises. That which does not arise does not exist, for example, the sprout of burnt seed.

In this case, it does. emptiness isn't anything at all. It does not exist, since it does not arise. It does not not-exist, since it does not perish, it does not both exist and not exist, or neither, because of the fault arising from the previous two alternatives. One cannot speak coherently about that which does not arise.

On the other hand, emptiness does not negate things, since it is the nature of things. The nature or essence of things is that they are natureless and essenceless. If there are no things, there is no emptiness of things to speak of.

Emptiness and nonexistence are similar terms, for example, a bucket that is empty and a bucket that does not exist. In the first case we say a bucket is empty because there is nothing in the bucket, such as water and so on. To say a bucket is empty is to say nothing exists in the bucket. In the second case, when we say that bucket does not exist, it makes no sense to speak of an empty bucket at all. There is no bucket to be empty.

When we say that things are empty, we are saying that things have no nature. There is nothing in things. Nothing fills them up. There is nothing to describe in things. That's why its fine to say that the nature of things is inexpressible. If there were something in things we could describe, being, existence, and so on, then we could describe that. But even nonexistence does not exist in things. Things are just empty. They are not filled with existence. they are not filled with nonexistence, and so on. They have not nature at all. They are hollow, mere appearances, nonarising by nature, like dreams, illusions, mirages, and other examples of empty things.  And when we examine things carefully, we find there are no things to be empty.

Still, empty buckets make the most noise, as the saying goes.

I think it possible that Tsongkhapa’s interpretation of Madhyamaka could be disparaged this way
This is what i was referring to as the semantic interpretation: “the ultimate truth is that there is no ultimate truth”, but this says nothing about the conventional and you can have both flat (all conventional truths have equal status, something close but different to the only real thing is appearance) or thick (allowing for hierarchies of conditionality in which no one level has intrinsic reality with what appears being merely on level among many) conceptions of conventional truth.

Malcolm wrote:
Not all relative truths are conventional truths. This is a well established principle in Madhyamaka. So, there is a hierarchy of relative truths, i.e. true and false relative truth; and true relative truth is also called conventional truth, which is validated through a correspondence between naming and function. A thing is conventionally true only if it is efficient in producing a named result (arthakriya). The purpose of this distinction is to account for conventional transactions in the world, and also to account for the ability of words and meanings to contribute to realization of emptiness and so on. Even in Dzogchen tantras, the efficiency of language is accepted. It is a universally accepted Mahāyāna Buddhist dogma, derived from Nāgārjuna, that one needs to rely on conventional truth in order to understand ultimate truth, and without such understanding, realization is impossible.

In the case of Buddhadharma, however, all that is required is insight into dependent origination. There is nothing particularly esoteric about it, apart from the mind's resistance to accepting its inevitable consequences: "Where that does not exist, this does not exist; with the ceasing of that, this ceased." That's all liberation is, according to the Buddha, or those texts which represent the Buddha to us.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, one must find out for oneself. However, your attack on the authority of inference and testimony is simplistic, and amounts to little more than the skepticism exemplified by Krishnamurti. It’s also characteristic of the materialist position, which claims only direct perception is valid.

Matt J said:
You should study tenet systems. The point of studying things is eliminate concepts and views one is unaware one is holding.
Exactly. No point is escaping one conceptual prison to confine oneself in a Buddhist one. But all I see here are concepts and stories.

Malcolm wrote:
The point is how one uses concepts to escape such confines. That’s the point of understanding to two truths, for example. In order to realize ultimate truth, one must understand it. In order to understand it, it must be understood through the words and conventions of relative truth. You might think that’s also just a story, and you are right. But it’s an efficient story, capable of bring about the result of liberation, the other stories are not efficient.

The point is this: does one think one has an existential problem to solve? Yes or no. If yes, what is that problem? Is it engendered externally or internally? If the latter, if one’s problem arises from oneself and is not imposed externally, how does one resolve that problem? Is that problem innate, and therefor irresolvable or is it adventitious? If it is the latter, then how is it resolved? If it comes from within, it cannot solved through any external condition, etc.

So we Buddhists are nang pas, we think that our problem comes from ourselves, from the unique causes and conditions which led to our present condition. Since we have this understanding, for us there can be no question of relying on some external solution, we cannot. Therefor, we must look into our own minds for the solution. Since we never can find any permanent entity within our mind, all we discover is that the mind continues based on cause and condition. When we examine those causes and conditions, we cannot find anything among them which we can say “this is it, this is my mind.” This is the famous emptiness we hear so much about. When we discover this, now we have wisdom with which we can burn away what we have identified as the cause of our existential problem, which from our perspective, is identifying an existent self, a person, and so on.

Some other systems have identified the problem as not recognizing our true self that somehow exists in the middle of these causes and conditions. The problem they have, however, is proving such an unconditioned entity exists within a conditioned entity. Thus why they also are not nangpas, because they claim that our true nature is something other than our conditioned, and hence empty, existence.

We don’t have this problem, because for us, there is no ultimate truth that can ever be divorced from relative truth. For this reason, it is quite reasonable reject the truth claims of other systems because in the end they must depend solely on the authority of testimony as proof of their ultimate truths, whereas ours are accessible even to analysis that can be conducted by ordinary people, not dependent upon grace, or anything else. This is the principle difference, then, between my school and the school,of others. YMMV. I also have no Advaita background because I found it’s arguments in in incung from the beginning, and when I did study yoga, Samkhya, and Advaita under a qualified Hindu instructor of these systems, my understanding of those systems was both refined and confirmed.

This is also true of some Buddhists, who in order to gain importance etc., claim to have visions of this bodhisattva and that, etc., even though they cannot properly explain even the five aggregates.

There are two ways: inference and direct knowledge of their minds.

Since we know there is no godhead, no higher being, etc., people who report such experiences, we can infer, are merely being overwhelmed by some cognitive state they are labeling a “mystical experience,” “grace,” etc., based on their social conditioning.

Honestly, from the point of view of the Buddhist path, we don’t care very much about the conceptual mishmash that other religions refer to as “spiritual experience.” It is not at all conducive to what we in the Buddhist fold understand liberation to be. We don’t even care very much about what Buddhists call “experience.” Why? Experience is conceptual and transient. Even the experience of nonconceptuality is a very subtle conceptual experience.

As for whether one can drawn equivalencies between the experience of emptiness, that is, nonconceptuality, in Buddhists and nonBuddhists, no one has claimed that nonconceptual experience is confined to Buddhists. But the experience of nonconceptuality is not the realization of emptiness, nor does it necessarily lead to the view of emptiness required for realizing emptiness. And indeed, the experience of emptiness aka nonconceptual can be a serious deviation even for Buddhists.

As Buddhists we are constantly told our experiences are not important, and that we should not get trapped in experiences, because experiences may be indicators of approaching realization, but attachment to them hinders realization. Since these experiences have been carefully mapped out along the stages of the path, it’s pretty easy, once one knows these stages and their indicators, to sort out where one is on the path, as well as where others are, if they happen to be on a path. We never bother to categorize the experience of worldly people because their experience is completely samsaric, whether they are so-called religious people, spiritual people, or not.

The only indicator that concerns us about people in other religious traditions is whether they demonstrate compassion or not. And even then, the compassion and idea of compassion in other traditions is crippled and limited. Otherwise, Buddhists and nonBuddhists have nothing in common, other than our common humanity.

Since other systems are not predicated on dependent origination, they have no actual value in terms of liberation from suffering.

Paths are either liberative or they are not, it’s not a matter of preference and choice. In Dharma, liberation is strictly defined as freedom from afflictions that result in suffering. No special mystical experience is required to verify this.

This is the unique teaching of the Buddha.

It appears you are saying without engaging in and practicing theistic traditions on their own terms, we cannot have any basis for accepting or rejecting their liberative value.

Since it is the case that the ultimate truth can only be understood on the basis of conventional truth, there is no direct or intuitive way that an ordinary person can detour around the conventionally-ascertained ultimate truth, in order to realize it properly. The reason for this is that there is nothing beyond the ultimate truth of conventional entities to realize at all. There is no ultimate truth to be realized beyond the true nature of compounded entities, since space and the two kinds of cessation are the only types of uncompounded phenomena.

Based on this fact we can dispense with the fantasy that theistic traditions are anything but nests of wrong view and confusion. This is because dependent origination and emptiness are found only in the Buddha’s teaching, and not in the teachings of other doctrines. They have no equivalents which would allow us to extend them the charity of allowing that their teachings lead to liberation. But it’s also not our job to correct then. As HHDL said, emptiness is none of their business.

The other possible consequence to your statement is that view doesn’t matter at all. But this is similar to claiming seed oil can be extracted from pressing sand.

What's at stake is the question of epistemic access to something which is non-conceptual, ineffable etc. One can refute metaphysics, theology etc, to the degree that they are stated in language or asserted as beliefs. But one can't really refute people's experiences of religious or spiritual kinds. Reading, for example, sociology of religion on such topics, it is perfectly obvious that theistic people experience various kinds of religious-spiritual states through their prayer, practices etc....and very often have difficulties matching that with particular creeds or ideas or dogmas.

Who are we to tell them: it's all b/s, because we know Chandrakirti? What conceit!

Nonbuddhists have all kind experiences which they regard as profound and spiritually transformational. But these experiences, categorically, lead them no closer to liberation.

Or, you will have to assume that dependent origination itself exists and is eternal.

By the way, science is now questioning whether time is fundamental.  Who knows, if one day science actually proved that time is indeed non-fundamental, we all will have to give up Buddhism, if Buddhism as understood by Malcolm is correct.

Not an argument against vaccinating them mind you, but as the article points out hospitalization rates are directly correlated with the number of elderly vaccinated in a community.

Covid Has Killed 5 Million People, But Only Hundreds Have Been Autopsied
To get a clearer picture of the virus’s aftermath, pathologists are pushing to resurrect a dying practice.

To get a clearer picture of the virus’s aftermath, pathologists are pushing to resurrect a dying practice.
By Jason Gale

In an air-locked chamber in the world’s largest research hospital, Daniel Chertow and a half-dozen doctors and scientists clad in astronaut-inspired protective gear are carrying out a microscopic search inside a 26-year-old man.

The patient went to the hospital with chest pain in spring 2020. He didn’t have typical Covid-19 symptoms, but Chertow wants to study him as part of a broader mission to understand where in the body the coronavirus goes and what it does in each of those places. If you’re a Covid case in Chertow’s emerging pathogens lab, you’re not there for treatment; you’re the subject of an autopsy.

The man died at the hospital and tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, so he doesn’t fit the definition of a Covid-related fatality. He succumbed to viral myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle. Chertow’s sleuthing points to the coronavirus as the culprit and offers clues about a rare inflammatory condition that occurs mostly in children after a mild case of Covid.

“They show up later with sometimes life-threatening inflammation in different organs,” Chertow says over Zoom from his office at the National Institutes of Health’s Clinical Center in Bethesda, Md. “In a way, he fits into that category, so what’s driving that?”

An autopsy provides a snapshot of what’s occurred at the moment a patient has died, enabling pathologists to infer what happened up to that point. By comparing a large number of autopsies on Covid patients at different time courses, scientists can begin to assemble something akin to a record of the virus’s journey through the body and the disease that arose in its wake.

Autopsies were a cornerstone of medical discoveries for more than two millennia, but sophisticated diagnostic tools and health-system budget cuts have made them a dying practice. Among the first 4 million fatal Covid cases worldwide, only several hundred autopsy findings were reported in international medical journals.

Several scientists are pushing to raise those numbers. “It’s critically important that thousands of autopsies are done, so we can put this picture together,” says Jeffery Taubenberger, a pathologist who heads the viral pathogenesis and evolution section of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda. “What we’re trying to figure out here is, what goes wrong under the worst circumstances where people die—to try to understand how the virus causes disease in less severe cases. And then: What are the therapeutic implications of that?”

The National Institutes of Health is spending $1.15 billion over four years to learn about the aftereffects of Covid-19, including a push to conduct more autopsies. Answers are urgently needed. At least 1 in 10 survivors of the disease experience what the World Health Organization calls “post Covid-19 condition”—a constellation of symptoms that can debilitate sufferers for months.

“The post-Covid stuff is very, very real,” says Chertow, a 47-year-old critical care physician. “If you’re going to begin to conceive of ways to prevent or treat those manifestations, you need to understand what’s driving it.”

Authorities were concerned in the panic-stricken early months of the pandemic that dissecting coronavirus-infected patients could spread the infection, resulting in at least half of the autopsy units in the U.S. being shut down, according to L. Maximilian Buja, a professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of Texas’s McGovern Medical School in Houston.
Buja, who finished his pathology training in 1972, co-led a call to action for detailed autopsies on Covid victims in April 2020 and kept his own academic center’s autopsy suites open. That enabled him to report findings from one of the earliest autopsy case series that showed the propensity for the coronavirus to cause tiny clots to form in patients’ blood.

“I take some credit, or partial credit, for getting across the idea that clinically, we need to institute early anticoagulation therapy,” he says. “We have glimmers of knowledge that have contributed to improved treatment for the patients, but there’s a lot more we have to learn. The key to this is to continue to do the autopsy investigations.”

Hamburg forensic pathologist Klaus Puschel defied Germany’s official recommendation to avoid autopsies, permitting 80 comprehensive post-mortem exams on fatal cases in March and April 2020. The findings showed SARS-CoV-2 can spread beyond the respiratory tract to affect the heart, kidney, liver, and brain.

A study Puschel co-authored that was published in October based on 17 autopsies showed the infection was associated with an increased number of defective capillaries in the brain that may explain the cognitive impairment, memory deficits, and fatigue experienced by at least a subset of long Covid patients. The authors also found that an experimental drug known as a RIPK1 inhibitor could potentially avert the damage if given to Covid patients during the acute phase of the illness.
Researchers in Norway showed in July that individuals who tested positive for the coronavirus eight months earlier were almost five times more likely than uninfected people to report memory problems. The NIH’s Chertow says he’s concerned about what such health effects may lead to in the future.
“Is there going to be some subclinical effects on your brain that are going to cause neurocognitive issues later in life that perhaps are not immediately noticeable or detectable?” he says. “If you’re going to begin to conceive of ways to prevent or treat those manifestations—either in the next group that might be exposed or among the group that are suffering—you need to understand what the drivers are.”

Chertow, who also trained as a disease detective with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s epidemic intelligence service, says he was inspired to pursue autopsy research from studying Ebola and treating patients with the deadly disease in Liberia in 2014. “It started with this idea that first [we’ve] got to go find where this virus is going—what it’s doing in those places—and then we’ve got to try to link it back to what we’re seeing clinically.”

Chertow helped identify the role of the salivary glands in SARS-CoV-2 transmission. He sees more valuable clues about the virus’s distribution across the body among the more than 10,000 biospecimens his team has collected from 44 fatal cases since April 2020. The post-mortem exams and dissections take three hours in a secure facility that’s required for work involving microbes that can cause serious and potentially lethal disease. Bioengineers on the NIH campus custom-built an enclosure that fits over the head and shoulders of the deceased to contain aerosols when the top of the skull is removed.
The seven or so doctors, scientists, and technicians working inside the autopsy suite wear multiple layers of personal protective equipment, says David Kleiner, chief of the post-mortem section of the National Cancer Institute, who worked with Chertow on the research. Usually a plastic apron is worn over a surgical gown, over an impermeable coverall, over surgical scrubs. Sometimes arm-sleeve protectors are worn. Investigators also don three pairs of gloves and two pairs of shoe coverings. And instead of N95 face masks, they breathe through controlled air-purifying respirators, which provide HEPA-filtered air under a hood that fits over their head and shoulders.

It’s cumbersome, but that’s not the only aspect of these Covid autopsies that makes the work painstaking. “We’re sampling way above and beyond what is done in any sort of typical autopsy,” Chertow says. Samples are taken from almost 100 different regions of the body and brain.
And for each one of those areas, adjacent pieces of tissue are also collected and preserved in different ways that are amenable to different methods of analysis, including whether the virus is capable of replicating in the sites from which it’s collected. “We’ve done, simply put, a much more extensive sampling than others have,” he says.

That partly reflects the diminishing capability to perform autopsies outside of academic and medical examiner settings.

“Autopsies are expensive procedures,” says Linda Isles, head of forensic pathology services at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine in Melbourne. “In reality, not many people want to spend money on dead people.” Private autopsy fees vary widely, but typically cost $2,000 to $4,000 in Maryland.

Doctors are ordering fewer autopsies, relying instead on lower-cost X-rays, MRI scans, and other tests to ascribe the cause of a patient’s death. This means pathologists have less experience performing post-mortem exams. In addition, autopsy facilities are expensive to maintain at a safe standard, Isles says.

“So it’s this spiral of decreased experience—and therefore decreasing confidence—and then underutilization of the facilities leading to some of the facilities essentially being mothballed,” she says. “And then when you want to reinstitute them, they’re no longer really safe for modern practice.”
Isles, who finished medical school at the University of Tasmania more than 20 years ago, performed 200 to 300 autopsies during her pathology training. “That might not seem like very many,” she says, “but if you compare that to anatomical pathology trainees now, then that is a very large amount.”
In 1918, doctors performed thousands of autopsies on victims of the Spanish flu and shared their findings widely in illustrated reports, says Taubenberger at the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases. “It’s terrible that here we are with our ability to do advanced molecular studies and advanced imaging studies, and yet so few autopsy studies are being done,” he says. “That’s really the tragedy.”

Title: This tribe helped the Pilgrims survive

Unknown said:
They still regret it 400 years later.

Long marginalized and misrepresented in U.S. history, the Wampanoags are bracing for the 400th anniversary of the first Pilgrim Thanksgiving in 1621

.....

By the fall, the Pilgrims — thanks in large part to the Wampanoags teaching them how to plant beans and squash in a mound with maize around it and use fish remains as fertilizer — had their first harvest of crops. To celebrate its first success as a colony, the Pilgrims had a “harvest feast” that became the basis for what’s now called Thanksgiving.

The Wampanoags weren’t invited.

Ousamequin and his men showed up only after the English in their revelry shot off some of their muskets. At the sound of gunfire, the Wampanoags came running, fearing they were headed to war.

“One hundred warriors show up armed to the teeth after they heard muskets fired,” said Paula Peters.

Told it was a harvest celebration, the Wampanoags joined, bringing five deer to share, she said. There was fowl, fish, eel, shellfish and possibly cranberries from the area’s natural bogs.

Is not the essence of mind dharmakaya?
How is mind’s true nature separate from sambhogakaya?

You are confusing the three kāyas of the basis with the three kāyas of the result. In essence, because the mind's nature is inseparable clarity and emptiness, emptiness is the basis for the realization of the dharmakāya, clarity is the basis for realizing the nirmanakāya, and inseparability is the basis for realizing the sambhogakāya. But this does not mean that the nature of your mind innately possesses the 32 major marks and the eighty minor marks.

The point that seemingly eludes our friend, is that recognition of the unfortunate origins of the US, etc., is not a sufficient reason to throw everything into chaos because of some ideological commitment. One cannot practice Dharma very well in the middle of a civil war or economic uncertainty. If businesses abandon the US because our political climate becomes hostile to business, it’ll be tough times. Democracy and well-oiled markets go together because trust is high. When that trust is eroded, markets suffer and poverty ensues.

The lower taxes and less regulation Republicans promise aren’t much good without a stable democracy, some business leaders told Ball. “The market economy works because of the bedrock foundation of the rule of law, the peaceful succession of power and the reserve currency of the U.S. dollar, and all of these things were potentially at risk,” former Thomson Reuters CEO Tom Glocer said. “CEOs are normally hesitant to get involved in political issues, but I would argue that this was a fundamental business issue.”

Republicans disagree. Today, in a remarkable op-ed in The American Conservative, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) called “corporate America... the instrument of anti-American ideologies.” He accused Wall Street of “devoting hundreds of billions of dollars to advance corporate propaganda” that promotes Marxist tactics. Rubio wants to “require that the leadership of large companies be subject to strict scrutiny and legal liability when they abuse their corporate privilege by pushing wasteful, anti-American nonsense.”

In a passage that sounds much like that of a political purge, he warned readers of “the current Marxist cultural revolution among our corporate elite,” and said that “the ultimate way” to stop them “is to replace them with a new generation of business leaders who consider themselves Americans, not citizens of the world…. That is how we defeat this toxic cultural Marxism and rebuild an economy where America’s largest companies were accountable for what matters to America: new factories built in America, good jobs for American families, and investments in American neighborhoods and communities.

Here is an empirical fact for you.

My friend's cousin contracted covid. He lost his sense of smell and had a headache for an afternoon, next day fine. No symptoms after this.

Move forward a year, has major medical event, unrelated to covid, unrelated to his lungs, or anything (kidney problems), and when they look at the results of his tomography, the damage to his lungs was extensive, and the pathologist agreed that damage was indeed from covid.

There will be many more instances of such cases. The reason we are not hearing about them now, is that finding this damage requires sophisticated imaging, and that is something which HMOs are unwilling to pay for in the US, but in Mexico it is very cheap.

You are a vastly more accomplished scholar (and almost certainly practitioner) than I am, but I think we will need to accept that neither has convinced the other here. I don't ever recall understanding that when Vajrahdara taught Tilopa it was in human form, but I'm open to hearing more about that. Similarly with dakinis, as you know, there are many classes of dakinis across the human/non-human spectrum, but generally 3-4 classes. I simply don't have the interest or time to drag this further, but I think without scratching the surface one could come up with dozens more examples of masters receiving (claiming to receive) teachings from non-humans. Virupa and Nairatmaya, etc. (yes, yes....pre-ripened).

Malcolm wrote:
When my book on the Path with Its Result comes out on May 22nd, 2022 from Shambhala, in the introduction I discuss in some detail the Sakya account of the origin of Vajrayāna teachings, including the origin of the Hevajra Tantra and its related tantras. My discussion of Nairatmyā, her identity, and her relationship with Virupa is to be found there as well.

Nairatmyā is clearly described as a nirmānakāya. Virupa first had a dream of her, then he met her the following day in person as a nirmāṇākāya. He received empowerments from this human women and achieved the first bhumi that first night. This is clearly explained in the Path with Its Result (lam 'bras) literature. There are two other women, identified as Nairatmya, in the other two primary lineages of Hevajra who are also clearly described as human women, one of them is named Vilaśyavajra, the guru of Anaṅgavajra, who in turn is the guru of Padmavajra.

As far as the historical record of Tilopa is concerned, there is no room for doubt that his his gurus were Vijaya and Antarapa and that he received Cakramsavara and its intimate instructions from them. This does not rule out his having received visionary transmissions from Vajradhara, but this would only be possible if a) Tilopa was himself a nirmāṇakāya (the Kagyu position), which means he was born fully realized, a buddha, or b) he received those transmissions after he attained mahāmudrā siddhi (the more conventional account). I have already explained how this works by using the examples of Ghantapada and Naropa.

One also only has one gender identity: masculine, feminine, or non-binary. And it does not necessarily correspond to one's biological sex. When it doesn't correspond, the person is transgender.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course it is relevant, and this is why the topic is confusing for people.

Also your assertion that people can only have one gender identity is false. A better way to put it is that people can only have one gender identity at a time.

The word gender is used a) a signifier for sex b) a signifier for identity.

When Chapelle declares "Gender is a fact," he means gender as a signifier for sex. So, he is not wrong.

The term "gender" is used promiscuously on both side of the issue, and often at cross purposes.

There is likely a biological basis for gender identity. Human physiology is complicated and it is not perfectly understood. There is an established biological basis for sex.

This is the reason, principally, where people used to refer to sex change operations, they now refer to such procedures as gender reassignment surgery and gender confirmation surgery.

For whatever reason, there are more transgender males (female --> male) than transgender females, with a ratio of about 2:1, but the transgender males generally do not provoke very much anxiety in people. What provokes anxiety in people is transgender females. They are the ones who experience the most hate violence around the public expression of their gender identity (this does not mean that transmen are not victims of violence).

This is why I suggested above that from a Buddhist point of view, there are definitely three sexes, and likely five, if we add transmen and transwomen.

For me there is no discomfort. Most of what we consider to be "visionary" is a product of experiential vision of yogis. Below the path of seeing these are mostly uncomfortable because the nāḍīs, vāyus, and bindu in our body are stuck, frozen, and not pliable. For those who have attained the path of seeing and so on in previous lifetimes, they have a difference experience of yoga, and thus, their visionary experiences seem more incredible.

If you have ever wondered why advanced yogis die painless deaths, it is because they have unravelled the nāḍīs which the vāyus and bindus to move freely within their bodies. It basically amounts to plumbing. Our pipes are clogged, theirs are not.

If you want to use the "ripened" argument for Tilopa, fine, but the *entire* history of terma and Mahayana more broadly is full of examples of humans taking teachings from non-humans.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, if you mean taking teachigns from nāgas, nāgas take teachings from buddhas and bodhisattvas, not the other way around.

I am not sure where you get the idea that buddhas and bodhisattvas are not humans, since it is only human beings who can practice a path.

I think you are confusing "visionary" with "nonhuman."  Ḍākas and ḍākinīs, for example, are human beings, as are buddhas and bodhisattvas.


Montoya said:
We can argue that the human/non-human interface is a metaphor, a upaya, or simply nirmanakya Buddhas in human form, but the record is clear here.

Malcolm wrote:
There is no human/non-human interface. Ḍākas and ḍākinīs, for example, are human beings, as are buddhas and bodhisattvas.

The point is simple: ordinary human beings, like you and I, cannot take teachings from anyone other than a nirmāṇakāya. In order to receive teachings from the sambhogakāya, one must be an eighth stage bodhisattva or higher.

Montoya said:
Personally, I find the teachings stand on their own merits, so its all a bit pedantic.

Malcolm wrote:
It isn't pedantry at all. Because people are ignorant of the paths and stages there is a great risk they will be deceived. If someone comes along, say some Tibetan lama, and claims "I have received teachings from the sambhogakāya" people need to be able to ascertain whether this person is really an eighth stage bodhisattva or not, otherwise they run the risk of being seriously deceived. The qualities of realization of an eighth stage bodhisattva can be ascertained with some ease if one has studied the sūtrayāna and vajrayāna stages of realization (abhisamaya).

In order to reveal treasures, the minimum requirement is that one must have attained the first bodhisattva stage. But revealing treasures, even mind treasures, is not receiving teachings directly from the sambhogakāya. The intermediary here is Padmasambhava, who is a nirmāṇakāya.

There is a class of teachings called "pure vision," and here one does not have to be first stage bodhisattva, but one must have some heat on path of application, that is some training in samadhi. And frankly, most people do not trust the pure vision teachings of anyone who is not a mahāsiddha, that is, someone who has not attained the path of seeing.

It is certainly true that that one can cultivate samadhis in order to see buddhas and receive teachings, and vague indications of these are framed in such sūtras as the Pratyutpana Samadhi Sūtra, and so on. But this will still not be a sambhogakāya buddhas one sees, but nirmāṇakāyas.

The reason for this is that ordinary people such as ourselves are incapable of seeing the sambhogakāya because we possess the obscuration of affliction, and until that is removed on the seventh bhumi, we are unable to perceive the sambhogakāya.


Montoya said:
Curious to hear your view on Dudjom Lingpa? His visions came as a child. Would you say he was ripened by human teachers in a former life? In the womb?

Malcolm wrote:
Dudjom Lingpa reports interesting dreams and visions as a child, there is no doubt. But he himself says these are all a result of his good karma and aspirations. He met his lama, Lama Jamyang in 1845, and clearly describes receiving empowerments from this lama, along with the claim that this person was his lama for many lifetimes. It is some years before he begins to reveal termas, after he does some retreats, especially Mañjuśrī Simhanada.

As for his claim that he did not receive view and meditation from any human lama, no one receives the view and meditation from anyone. We receive transmissions, but the view and meditation we must discover for ourselves. So I do not find his claim to be as extraordinary as others do.

Sorry, but I find all of this rather unconvincing. Even if you accept that Tilopa was ripened before meeting Vajradhara, how was he ripened? He was ripened by the four special siddhis. And where did he receive those? From human teachers. And where did they receive them? From dakinis.

The broader point I am attempting (and apparently failing) to make, is that we as Westerners must confront and accept (or not) rather outrageous claims such as receiving teachings from non-human sources. Your approach seems to be "well, yes, those teachings did occur, but they were not necessary as there were humans involved elsewhere in the process." That seems a bit of a side step, but okay.

As for the Karma Kagyu specifically, I make no claims to it being the definitive voice of Tibetan Buddhism, but it is one strain of lineage which claims descent from Tilopa and as such worthy of having its own views on the matter unless you choose to dismiss them on polemical grounds.

By simple logic then, and simple kindness, shouldn't all webcasts (access to the Teachings) be open and free?

Malcolm wrote:
Then when we did the retreats some people would come to the retreats and ask why they would have to pay for teaching. Nobody pays for the teaching.  They pay for the organization, for the place, for all the expenses.

This still applies. Someone has to pay for the servers, the gars, etc. So if your membership is not current, you are not paying "for the organization, the place, for all the expenses."

Are you claiming that the lineage through Vijaya (back through Saraha) is an unbroken human lineage back to Shakyamuni?

Malcolm wrote:
Cakrasamvara does not come through Śākyamuni at all.

Why? Because the Cakrasamvara mandala still exists in this world in the 24 places, it was never closed unlike Hevajra, Guhyasamāja, Kālacakra, etc., and in these 24 places the nirmāṇakāya is still teaching this mandala (its one of the reasons it is so effective in this age). And of course, the nirmānakāya is inseparable from the sambhogkāya and the dharmakāya. In any case, this transmission was bestowed by Vajradhara upon Vajrapāṇi. Vajrapāṇi is a tenth stage bodhisattva, but he is also a human being, as is the nirmāṇakāya who teaches in the 24 places. So it is an unbroken human lineage, all the way back to nirmāṇakāya Śrī Heruka Vajradhara in the 24 places.

Now, Vajrapāṇi bestowed this upon Saraha at Śrīparvata in S. India along with the root tantra. etc., the latter in turn transmitted this to Nāgārjuna in S. India and the rest is history.

Montoya said:
Well, yes and the time you speak of is also the time of yakshas, rakshasas, the mighty and fearsome Bhairava, etc. I'm afraid that once we are at the point of them being tenth stage bodhisattvas also incarnated as humans then we have drifted into deep waters and there is really no further discussion to be had.

Malcolm wrote:
All of the information I have provided to you is sourced from authoritative tantras in Kenjur, and their commentaries which one can find in the Tengyur, as well as the Naropa oral tradition.

The compiler of the tantras is Vajrapāṇi. There are many emanations of Vajrapāṇi, but in particular, the Indrabhūtis, all three, are regarded as Vajrapāṇi emanations and are predicted in the Tantras, and they too all had human gurus. In the case of the first, it was Śākyamuni Buddha, the later two had different gurus.

You seem to think I am making an argument that transmissions through visions and dreams are impossible. I never said that. But ordinary people have to be ripened by human gurus. There is no precedent at all for an ordinary human being to have some kind of visionary empowerment from an awakened being. Such an idea represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the paths and stages. A nirmāṇakāya is an awakened being in the form of an ordinary human being, for example, Śākyamuni Buddha; his voice is the sambhogakāya, and his mind is the dharmakāya. Not even tenth stage bodhisattvas can perceive the dharmakāya. Only buddhas can perceive this.

Even then, the account of Tilopa in the Life Stories of the 84 Mahāsiddhas by Abhayadatta is sure to disappoint. He describes Tilopa as a pandita and a court priest, who becomes disgusted when he recognizes that when he gives teachings, everyone is distracted. He then leaves for a charnel ground outside of Kañci where he begs for alms and practices. He then meets Naropa, who provides Tilopa with provisions for the next ten years, after which time, Tilopa attains mahāmudra siddhi. He departs to deva realms where he continues to practice, and attains the siddhis of body, speech, and mind, and eventually physically departed to Khecari realm. So according to this this account, when Naropa first met Tilopa, the latter had not even attained siddhi.

My question to you is this: can your mind comprehend that there are different accounts? Or is the "Mah lineage" the only one that matters to you. Because if it is the latter, what makes you any different than a fundamentalist Christian?

So essentially you just completely wrote off what Jigme Lingpa wrote then. Is that fair to say?

Malcolm wrote:
I wrote off the examples Jigme Lingpa uses as faulty and disputable, since they had already been refuted 700 years before him. And he is just literally copying Pema Karpo either directly or through some intermediate source.

You have to read the whole text by Atisha, then the meaning becomes clear.

In the beginning he says:

My guru, Samayavajra, said, This vehicle is superior to the pāramitāyāna, superior in terms of the guru, empowerment, samaya, intimate instructions, and diligence.

The passage in question comes about from a description of how one receives vows:

For the first vow, an abbot and a master is required. For the second vow, one needs a guru, or even if that is lacking, it can be taken. For the last, there are four divisions: there is the empowerment that arises from the mouth of the guru, there is the empowerment of the blessing of the gnosis deity, there is the empowerment of the prediction of the ḍākinīs, and there is the empowerment of the obtained through the power of one's own mind.

This is just a description of the four empowerments, the vase, secret, third, and fourth, and not a description of four separate kinds of empowerments.

After this, after describing the benefits of the four empowerments, he says:

"Never avoid the meditation practice and dharma practice with the pledged deity, never avoid faith and respect with the guru; never avoid samayas and vows with the ḍākinīs..."

There is no other way, no short cuts, even if you take birth in Sukhavati. It is unlikely you will meet Vajrayāna, but maybe, if you are lucky.

The third is exemplified by the story of Nagarjuna and Jagadbhadra. Without permission, they took from a Buddhist temple in Oddiyana two texts: the Two Segments and the Tantra of Mahamaya. They were pursued by the vajra dakinis, who caught them and commanded them to become inheritors of these teachings and to expound them....

It would seem to me that for example King Ja, here, did not receive empowerment in the way we would often think, in the manner of the first category.

Malcolm wrote:
The example of King Jah is a very poor one, actually, and is much disputed. There isn't even a tantra called The Continuation of the Śrī Samvarodaya Tantra. Instead the citation comes from one of the Anuyoga Tantras.

Also the tale about Nāgārjuna is just so much gossip. Sonam Tsemo (1142-1182) writes in the General Presentation of Tantras:

Some claim “The Hevajra Tantra was revealed by the great master called ‘Dombi Heruka.” Others claim “Master Nāgārjuna stole it disguised as an idiot” These are a source of laughter. 

How are these a source of laughter?  The masters will be slandered because there is no magical power to be attained from stealing on the first bodhisattva stage. The ḍākinīs will be slandered because how would the caretaker of the books not recognize Nāgārjuna, the theft, and so on? Our own Dharma will be slandered because the lineage would be from a stolen book. 

Likewise, the Mahāmāya Tantra was revealed by master Kukuripa...

If you don’t have this opportunity yet, you can still perform guru yoga as the guru principle is everywhere.

Malcolm wrote:
No, one cannot. This is a farce. No empowerment, no guru yoga. Guru yoga is a practice only found in unsurpassed yoga tantra. It does not exist in the lower tantras nor does it exist in sūtra. The permission to practice guru yoga only comes from receiving the unsurpassed yoga tantra empowerment in full or alternately, with direct introduction of Dzogchen or Mahāmudrā.

Can one supplicate the Buddha, the great bodhisattvas, and important teachers of the past? Is there merit in that? Yes and yes. But this is not guru yoga.

The essence of guru yoga resides in the living connection one has with one's guru and the merging of the guru's body, speech, and mind with one's own body, voice, and mind forged through empowerment. That living connection is based on the transmission of the special gnosis one receives at the time of empowerment. Without this introduction, there is no basis for the practice of guru yoga at all.

Even in practices such as the guru yogas of Milarepa, Padmasambhava, and so on, the point is that while the form of the guru is in the aspect of this or that historical teacher, the essence is one's own root guru. This point is extremely important. Our root gurus are the conduit through which we are able to access the true blessings and empowerment of the lineage going back to Buddha Vajradhāra. This is why it is so important to maintain pure samaya and so on.

There is a reason that the Karma Kagyu lineage tree starts at Vajradhara and not one of Tilopa's human teachers.

Malcolm wrote:
Sure, and the Sakya Yoginī starts Vajradhara --> Vajrayogini--> Naropa.  But this does not mean that Tilopa was not Naropa's guru, nor that Vijaya was not Tilopa's guru, and so on.

Similarly, Ghantapāda's guru was the mahāsiddhā Darikapa, but the lineage for his system is Vajradhara --> Vajrayogini--> Ghantapāda. And guess what, in this lineage, Tilopa is preceded by Vijaya. So, it is no disrespect to Darikapa that he is not included in the Ghantapāda lineage. Just as it is no disrespect to Vijaya that the Karma Kagyu lineages begins Vajradhara--> Tilopa, just as it is no disrespect that Naropa is preceded by Yoginī, and so on. But in reality, Darikapa was Ghantapāda's guru, Vijaya was Tilopa's guru, and Tilopa was Naropa's guru. The gurus of each of these mahāsiddhas was themselves a mahāsiddha. What do mahasiddhas realize? Mahāmudrā. So it is a strange claim to argue that Tilopa only received mahāmudrā transmission from "Vajradhara," when a) there is the fact that Tilopa received mahāmudra introduction from another of his gurus, Antarapa, b) and any practitioner worth their salt regards their guru/s as Vajradhara in person.

Montoya said:
Again, I am not proposing this as a valid path for students today, but we can't ignore that this is very much 'a thing' in the history of Tibetan Buddhism.

Malcolm wrote:
Kagyus do not own Tilopa anymore than they own Naropa. I would say that quite frankly, you are making arguments from a paucity of information. There are many histories of the Cakrasamvara lineage which you can read, if you know Tibetan. I think you will be surprised at what you discover, and much of your present certainty will vanish.

Tilopa's mahāmudrā realization came about as a result of his own meditation on the creation and completion stage systems of Cakrasamvara, which he received from his guru, Vijaya.

No, it is not, as it's not a point anyone in this particular thread has made, we were debating purely whether Oysters were sentient or not.

Even if Buddhists eat meat, meat that is suspected of being killed in the three ways, is forbidden. In other words you cannot specifically have an animal die for you, nor suspect that it died for you(specifically), consuming living beings obviously contradicts this which is why it is relevant to the precept of refuge and killing.

An authentic teacher has indeed gone to "guru school."

There is gurukula and guruparamparā. If one has not received empowerment, one not is a member of the Vajragurukula, the family of the vajra guru, one has no samaya, and one has no guruparamaparā, no lineage of gurus. Thus one has no business even looking at the tantras, etc.

These days, in this degenerate era, there are some people who have fallen prey to evil views, and feel that they are smarter than the Buddha, who taught the tantras; the mahāsiddhas, who realized their meaning; the paṇḍitas who commented upon them; the translators, who made them available to us to practice.

In this degenerate age is very important to hold fast to the way the tantras should be taught, and not substitute our own fabrications for the authentic teachings of the Buddha. That is, find a qualified guru of an authentic lineage, request teachings, and then follow their instructions as best one can, and avoid people who do not respect this path, even if they claim themselves to be Vajrayāna practitioners.

So if one has Zhitro empowerment from Lama A, then one regards withing the practice of Zhitro root guru as Lama A and if one has Vajrakilaya from Lama B, it is Lama B for Vajrakilaya?

What if one feels more affinity and karmic connection to Lama C?

And what about the principle of unifying all teachers? By which I mean for eg. one does GY of Padmasambhava from Lama D and trains to see Guru Padmasambhava as the embodiment of all ones teachers?

Malcolm wrote:
All I can tell you is how ChNN practiced. One, he did unite all gurus into one, and this is appropriate. This is also how I practice.

But when he was practicing a specific practice, such as Zhitro of Namcho, he would bring to mind that guru from whom he received that transmission, Gongkar Rinpoche; or when practicing Adzom Drukpa's Tāra, Gyalsey Gyurme Dorje; etc., or Simhamukha, Ayu Khandro, etc.

So there is no contradiction here, and indeed, it strengthens one's connection to the practice. So for example, if I practice any practice, I unite all gurus there, and I also recall specifically the guru from whom I received it. I try not to play favorites with my gurus.

Malcolm wrote:
No, it is an imagined, nonexistent self that causes and experiences everything, for example, when a car is in accident, it is the imagined car for which one pays the damages, not the wrong view of the imagined car. But perhaps this is a special point of Candrakīrti's Madhyamaka, unlikely to be found the Visuddhimagga.

Astus said:
In one manner of speaking it can be said so that it's the self/car that acts or is damaged, but at the same time, any type of self-view is imputed in dependence on the aggregates (according to Candrakirti too: MA 6.150 and 6.162-164), just as a car is imputed in dependence on its parts. And just as if the windshield is broken then saying 'the car is damaged' is talking in general terms, similarly, whatever actions and results occur are the causal events of the aggregates, even if commonly it can be said to be that of a self or being.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, that's not the point really. The imputation itself is the agent and recipient of action, that's the point. Otherwise, one faces the contradiction of asserting that something real passes from this life to the next (consciousness), but we know that nothing at all passes from this life to the next. Certainly other Mādhyamikas make allowances for this and are prepared admit consciousness is an appropriate basis of imputation for a self, which can pass from this life to the next, and is the agent and recipient of action, conventionally speaking, but Candra will not go that far:

MAV, verse 6:162

Likewise, the self is asserted to be the appropriator
in dependence on the aggregates, sense elements,
and sense basis that worldly acknowledge—
appropriation is the action, this is also the agent.

The commentary clarifies:

Although the self is not defined as a mundane convention in relative truth, but like a chariot, it is asserted to be the appropriator.

The next three passages bring the point to bear well. Not sure what translation you are using, but the Padmakara version is fuzzy on this point.

So, this is a special point of Candrakīrti's which one can discover more fully discussed by Gorampa in his Differentiation of Views.
