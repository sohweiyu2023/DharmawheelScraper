But seriously:  Some conversations are shut down due to member's requests, not due to policy.  Weirdly enough we sometimes respect member's requests (ie when they are sane and logical).

Malcolm wrote:
Right, so, is it sane and logical that we Vajrayāna practitioner abide by the basic requirement expected of Vajrayāna practitioners, which is to keep secret that which should be kept secret from those who do not have samaya? The excuse, "well, it is posted on the internet" is not sufficient warrant for people who have samaya to share with people who do not. For example, just because there are a million pictures of Vajrayogini on the internet, does not mean it is ok or correct for someone who has samaya to share such an image with someone who does not.

The point I am addressing is students sharing restricted material about Vajrayāna practices on this forum.

Astus said:
Ontologically talking is perhaps going a bit too far, as the meaning of "dharma" is more along the line of category than substance.
in Shravakyana the anatman teaching does not rule out the possibility of something unconditioned and not unreal
Being a cessation does not make it unreal.

"is called Nibbāna because it is a departure from craving, which is an entanglement.
Though Nibbāna is onefold according to its intrinsic nature, by reference to a basis (for distinction), it is twofold, namely, the element of Nibbāna with a residue remaining, and the element of Nibbāna without the residue remaining. It is threefold according to its different aspects, namely, void, signless, and desireless."
(A Comprehensive Manual of Abhidhamma, p 258-259)

"In fact nibbāna, as an unconditioned reality, has simply the nature of cessation called “the characteristic of peacefulness” (santilakkhaṇā). It is the cessation of the defilements and the rounds of suffering. Or, it is the nonexistence of conditioned phenomena (visaṅkhāra), the cessation of conditioned phenomena, and the opposite of what is conditioned."
"If the nibbāna element does not exist, then the cessation of the mental and physical processes or the aggregates could not happen. Thus it is not true that the nibbāna element is nothing, like the concept of nonexistence. Being the object of path and fruition, it is obvious in an ultimate sense. And because it is so obvious, the constantly arising mental and physical processes or aggregates in a person who practices correctly do not arise anymore after that person’s parinibbāna. Then, they are able to cease forever. It means that the cessation is something that can be obvious."

I wanted to start a thread about this important subject that keeps re-occurring in various threads.

Secret Mantra began in India with Mahasiddhas like Tilopa and was transmitted to Tibet by Marpa and Padmasambhava and others.

Tibet is a mountain-locked country, historically difficult to access, where Esoteric Teachings like Tantrayana/Vajrayana were as I read were often transmitted and practised in secret and remote locations at night in some cases.

Now with the advent of the Airplane, Globalism, Smartphones and Macs. Tantrayana is accessible in a way that hitherto hasn't been possible.

Also, we live in a Global Village where Privacy is a thing of the past, Data on all kinds of aspects is recorded and finally we are encouraged by Social Media to document every last facet of our lives for everyone to see.

The aspect of Secrecy is important so I wonder what are the most important things practitioners should keep in mind?

I'm not asking anyone to divulge anything that needs to be private it's more of a meta-discussion.

Gotcha. Thing is, emptiness is way harder to get your head around than brahman. (Unless you're OCD like me and worry the c'hell out of the 'exact' nature of brahman.) So, as a teaching methodology, brahman is (I'm guessing) more effective for more students than sunyata. It's a bit like a fairy tale vs. a sober dissertation ... both of which are, ultimately, just buncha concepts flying around and pushing human buttons.

Malcolm wrote:
People like to believe the ultimate is something, even if that something is inexpressible. Since in Buddhadharma there is no ultimate apart from the relative, emptiness is only hard to understand for those who wish there to be some permanent, ultimate something which is not dependently originated. Awakening in Buddhadharma comes from understanding the ultimate nature (emptiness) of relative phenomena (dependent origination). There is nothing to realize other than this.

The reason why Vajrayāna is decline is not sex scandals with gurus, it because people do not keep secret what is supposed to be secret. Vajra recitation is a completion stage practice. It is therefore secret.

If you want to share secret vajrayāna instructions with people you don't know over the internet, who state very clearly they have no empowerments, no guru,and thus no samaya and little understanding, and in the process break your own samaya, please do so by private message.

Back to the point, you live in Sweden -- Swedish laws around sexual misconduct are very strict. Much of the behavior we hear about is quite definitely actionable criminal behavior under Swedish law. Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche has a very sensible approach to these issues -- rather than insisting that Vajrayāna masters are above normal moral, legal, and ethical constraints, he observes that if one follows Dzogchen rules, one is likely to get arrested in Italy. So in Italy, one follows Italian rules, not Dzogchen rules. If Vajrayāna gurus do not have enough sense to understand the place where they live or are traveling, this calls into question both their wisdom and their skillful means.

On the other hand, many people fool themselves into believing they have encountered the mind essence, and equally, there are unscrupulous teachers who have no  qualifications to evaluate such an encounter, who lie to their students in order to appeal to the latter's egos.

Since you bring up the fact that this is a Vajrayāna forum, these points of view must also be considered. The reality, Dear Magnus, is that no one can introduce one to the mind essence. You must discover it on your own, a guru is merely a guide who helps you with the process of self-discovery, but the actual recognition is your job.

Here there is no method and wisdom,
the appearance of true reality,
can’t be described by another, the connate
cannot be found anywhere,
but one can understand it in dependence on the Guru, 
time and method, and from one’s merit.

Per process philosophy what 'exists' are dynamic events. Madhyamaka refutes the existence of fixed substances, not of dynamic events. Or?

Astus said:
Does that dynamic event exist in the present, the past, or the future? If it is in the past or the future, it is non-existent. If it is in the present, how is it an event?

Rick said:
Per process philosophy, there are no enduring substances, only 'momentary events of experience' called actual entities which unfold over time (as a process unfolds over time). So, to your question:

> Does that dynamic event [actual entity] exist in the present, the past, or the future?

I couldn't find a definitive answer to this. According to the process philosophy savvy people I spoke with, it's a subtle and tricky question.

Actual entities play out over time, so past present future are all involved. But the existence part is where things get fuzzy. I'd say actual entities exist, but not in the conventional way of existing. The *flow* exists, but there is no-thing (no substance) that is flowing. (This reminds me of the causal non-substance flow of Pratītyasamutpāda.)

To reframe the question:

To take an empowerment without the intent to practice it... Or maybe without the intent to practice it continually until attainment. Should this be avoided?

The tatagatagarbha chapter from Longhenpa's trilogy of rest explains...

Malcolm wrote:
I directed you to look at the Tshig don mdzod, chapter three. He introduces the chapter saying, "Then, the explanation of how buddhagarbha permeates the sattvadhātu and the way it is exists.

He begins by quoting the Mirror of the Essence of Vajrasattva above. He then cites the Fine Inlay ofJewels:

Just as oil has always been naturally present in
sesame or mustard seed,
within the deceptive appearance of the bodies of sentient beings
the seed of the tathāgatas
appears with matching light.

The Sound Tantra states:

The pristine consciousness of one's vidyā abides in the body, 
like oil in sesame seed. 
The glow and brightness of the body
has always been permeated with the moistness of pristine consciousness.


And the Self-Arisen Vidyā:

The transcendent state of perfect buddhas
exists in the forms of kāyas and pristine consciousness
in the personal continuums of all sentient beings.


Having introduced these citations, he turns to sūtras and tantras of the common vehicles, citing long passages from the Nirvana Sūtra, Hevajra, the Dohas and so on, concluding that all of these citations together, including those from the man nga sde tantras above, demonstrate the existence of the sugatagarbha element in the continuums of sentient beings. He then goes on to criticize those who maintain that sugatagarbha is merely the emptiness of the mind itself, and so on. He then goes on to describe how the tathāgatagarbha doctrine is definitive, and so on.  Finally describing how sugatagarbha is present as five kāyas, five pristine consciousnesses, the five lights, the five families, the five vāyus of pristine consciousness, the five qualities of essence, nature, and compassion, the five afflictions, the five aggregates, the five elements, the five sense organs, the five desirable objects, and the five qualities of the three doors, citing the String of Pearls Tantra which explains all of this.

For Longchenpa the pristine consciousness of vidyā is nothing other than tathāgatagarbha. And according to ChNN, there is no Tibetan whose writings on the Great Perfection are more definitive than Longchenpa's. So we can understand the above to be ChNN's own view as well.

It is a bit of an overstatement to claim the view of Dzogchen has nothing in common with tathāgatagarbha view. Longchenpa would strongly disagree with you. After all, he spends the entirety of chapter three of the Tshig don mdzod explaining the precise relevance of tathāgatagarbha view to Dzogchen.


Further, the entire subject of chapter 39 of the Kun byed rgyal po is tathāgatagarbha, called here "jinagarbha."

Since they think Shambhala is authentic, they think the teachers in Shambhala are authentic.

Trungpa is kind of the third rail in Tibetan Buddhism. Many people do not actually approve of him, but since he built a very successful organization, no one in the Tibetan hierarchy will directly criticize him. For this reason, people will continue to be attracted to Shambhala. They have turned Trungpa into a very successful brand.

I'm somewhat new to Tibetan style Buddhism. As I'm navigating this world of empowerments and gurus, I'm a little confused about the nature of public teachings. Some people say it's a great opportunity, that you need empowerment to be able to practice, etc... Others say all it is is symbolic and is basically just a blessing, no real empowerments are given at these big teachings. Others say it's a waste of time, just take empowerments from your own guru (and lineage).

I've looked around a bit, and haven't found much yet about what it means to "take empowerment as a blessing." It seems Kalu Rinpoche has said one can take empowerment with the intention 1) To take it merely for blessing, 2) To practice at some point in the future, 3) To practice immediately. Is intention all that is needed to make an empowerment either a blessing or an initiation? How does one go about "taking empowerment as a blessing" (say, if one does not wish to actually practice it every day or at all)?

Is it wise to take many empowerments as blessings, perhaps to create good karmic links with many teachers and lineages? Or would it merely confuse the mind and the spirit?

In Advaita, the only thing that cannot be negated (seen to be ultimately un-real) is one's own existence: I Am. (I'm not opening a conversation about Advaita vs. Buddhism. Been there, done that! I just used Advaita as an example of a tradition that relies on via negativa negation.)

Is there anything that cannot be negated in Buddhism? Can one's existence be negated? Or would it be right-er in Buddhism to say: I neither am, nor am not, nor neither, nor both? To what extent does the answer depend on the Buddhist school/tradition?

1: see if we can contact the translator. She may know.

2: contact the office of Dudjom Yangsi Rinpoche and see if we can find out directly from him.

I still have the feeling that it's the Sogdrub based on a few things Dudjom Yangsi mentioned. But we just don't know.

BTW the “Rangtong Ma-yin-gag” is the view that I’m leaning towards now. It has self-emptiness but with the universal positive qualities of Buddha Nature also—if I understand it correctly. There’s no separate Reality, which is the offensive Hindu heresy. It is mentioned in Situ R’s “Creation and Completion”.

To me the positive intrinsic qualities of Buddha Nature are what is important. Saying it is separate and Real is just adding emphasis.

Wouldn’t the appearance of other sentient beings only be the rtsal manifestations of one’s own basis?

Page 300 of "The Big Red Book" in the chapter titled "Superiority of Atiyoga". Remember, he is not discussing sutra here. He is discussing Dzogchen and why it is superior to the lower 8 yanas.

Also worthy of note is the fact that he says that Nagarjuna/2nd Turning and Asanga/3rd Turning are both contained in Dzogchen. That is to be expected and does not negate my point. All Shentong view includes Nagarjuna. Elsewhere he explains that his interpretation of the 3rd Turning is "Great Madhyamaka" (a.k.a Shentong). Interestingly he includes the Dharmadhaturstava ("In Praise of Dharmadhatu") as one of Nagarjuna's. It certainly is not like Nagarjuna's other writings.

Now concerning this natural expression of the Great Perfection: The Sugata, during the intermediate promulgation of the transmitted precepts*, did not reveal the structure of the fundamental reality, though he did extensively teach the inconceivable, abiding nature without referring to symbols of elaborate conception. And, during the final promulgation**, though he did reveal the structure of the fundamental reality, he did not teach the characteristic path through which it is actualized. Therefore, the conclusive intention of the Two Promulgators*** actually abides without contradiction in the nature of the Great Perfection. This intention comprises the unaltered intention of the Collection of Madhyamaka Reasoning,, which consists of the commentaries on the intermediate promulgation by the sublime and supreme Nagarjuna; and his [ Collection of Eulogies ] including the Eulogy to the Expanse of Reality ****, and the commentaries by the regent Maitreya, the sublime and supreme Asanga, and his brother [Vasabandhu] and so forth, which together form the intention of the final [promulgation]. If one were to ask why this is the case, it is because these masters did not claim anything other than the profound abiding nature of natural reality, and because the Great Perfection itself is none other than that.
(bolding/underlining mine)

So he says, "... during the intermediate promulgation of the transmitted precepts, did not reveal the structure of the fundamental reality ".

But he then say of Asanga/Vasabandhu, "....because these masters did not claim anything other than the profound abiding nature of natural reality...,"

So he accepts the 3rd Turning as being "profound abiding nature of natural reality, and because the Great Perfection itself is none other than that.

So Dudjom R. had no problem utilizing the 3 Turning paradigm to explain and define how Dzogchen is superior to the other yanas. Since he saw it as appropriate, so do I.


*****

*a.k.a. The 2nd Turning of the Wheel of Dharma
**a.k.a. The 3rd Turning of the Wheel of Dharma
*** Nagarjuna and Asanga
****Available in English as "In Praise of Dharmadhatu"

All this is in regards to Dudjom R's interpretation of Dzogchen. Evidently he is an outlier in this among Nyingmapas. However Kongtrul also has a Shentong view of Dzogchen, and he is not an outlier among Karma Kagyupas. So at least one major school supports that idea within the context of Dzogchen specifically.

With Prajnaparamita yes. With Mahamudra and Dzogchen it depends on who you talk to.

In "Myriad Worlds" Kongtrul writes: What is the fundamental nature of the original primordial ground of being, before buddhas appear by realizing it and before sentient beings appear by not realizing it? To answer this the tradition of Great Perfection states that the claims concerning the ground based on the perspectives of persons who adhere to philosophical tenets are mistaken.
Make no mistake, this book is about Kongtrul's cosmology. He starts with Abhidharma, then the Kalachakra cosmology, then the above is the beginning of his Dzogchen cosmology.

Malcolm wrote:
Kongtrul's review of Dzogchen "cosmology" is rather incomplete in the Encyclopedia (he gives a more detailed and complete overview in other places). Also the term "ground of being" has no correlate in Tibetan. It is an erroneous translation of the simple term "gzhi," that is, basis.

Also, the nature of the original basis is ka dag, original purity, i.e., emptiness free from extremes. There are severn presentations of the basis in Dzogchen, the only non-erroneous one is that the basis is originally pure. Original purity is a special term for emptiness which has never been contaminated by ignorance.

If one held the view that mahamudra and dzogchen have the same basis and the same fruit, that just the paths are distinct (but lets be honest overlapping- cf. JLing Lion's Roar on stillness movement noticing in Dzogchen as but one of kotis of examples), then does that just boil down to two distinct sets of texts, instructions, practices, practice communities?

Fantastic, thank you.  I'm afraid I've never met a Sakyapa in the flesh, so my knowledge of the Lamdre system is less than meager, thanks for the response.  I was really thinking of Kagyu/Nyingma sythesis, just since that's all I've really ever had any depth of exposure to (and some straight Nyingma, straight Kagyu, though neither has really clicked).  Interesting, though, in that I made some quasi-perrenialist statements above without even considering a Lamdre view.  The impression I get is that Kagyu Mahamudra and Sakya Lamdre could be the hardest view/practice systems to reconcile. Jampa Thaye does it, I guess, Karma Thinley.  Ka-Nying and Nyinga/Sakya syncretism though seem to be more common. But 5 aggregates as the basis does make Lamdre hard to reconcile w Dz as well, at least to uninstructed worldlings like yours truly.

(Context: I had in mind a statement on a deleted? thread that MM and Dz have same basis, same fruit, different paths- which I gather does not jibe w the view of Lamdre)  Wonder if Lamdre-Dz practitioners would conceive of the two as parallel practice milieu that should be engaged, simultaneously or in sequence, or whether those practitioners find a way to fit one set of instruction/practices within the other.  I guess those are not mutually exclusive responses- you could subsume one system within the other in sequence. Simultaneously would be hard.

Re-reading your quote above though makes me think that a practitioner of some capacity could practice Lamdre from a Dz point of view, but not vice versa.  Unless different bases can have the same fruit, though I don't recall coming across that idea before..

Nowhere in Buddhadharma is it explained that you can read for "academic purposes". The thing is, academics don't give a damn about what Buddhadharma says, because they use the excuse that they are academics, therefore they read, and do whatever they feel like in this context.

But if you've not received a relevant empowerment and transmission, it's a different story. Then you should wait until you do get the relevant empowerment and transmission.

I hear what you’re saying, but it seems what matters is empowerment come from someone with instructions from the lineage.

“Homage to Vajrakumāra”

“Please bestow...

“Firstly,... in general, power falls into four categories: the power that is attained even without empowerment is the best, comprising that power that is gained by the mind as a result of correctly realizing the view. Power is not attained, even without the ritual empowerment, when the guru as no lineal instructions and the disciple has no vows. Power attained through empowerment is gained by a disciple who has accepted vows from a guru who possesses lineal instructions. And one who has not received the empowerments, although the empowerments have been bestowed upon him, and has gained nothing, even though it has all been given, is like someone whose mind is completely black.”

Be careful at the beginning , because once the relationship has been established nothing can be changed unless the guru gives you permission to no longer regard  him as your guru. Once the relationship has been formed there is no heavier karma than giving up the guru, renouncing the guru as an object of devotion. It is a much heavier negative karma than committing the five uninterrupted negative actions. Among all heavy karmas, this is the heaviest.

Then the Licchavi Vimalakirti said to the patriarch Mahakasyapa, "Reverend Mahakasyapa, the Maras who play the devil in the innumerable universes of the ten directions are all bodhisattvas dwelling in the inconceivable liberation, who are playing the devil in order to develop living beings through their skill in liberative technique. Reverend Mahakasyapa, all the miserable beggars who come to the bodhisattvas of the innumerable universes of the ten directions to ask for a hand, a foot, an ear, a nose, some blood, muscles, bones, marrow, an eye, a torso, a head, a limb, a member, a throne, a kingdom, a country, a wife, a son, a daughter, a slave, a slave-girl, a horse, an elephant, a chariot, a cart, gold, silver, jewels, pearls, conches, crystal, coral, beryl, treasures, food, drink, elixirs, and clothes - these demanding beggars are usually bodhisattvas living in the inconceivable liberation who, through their skill in liberative technique, wish to test and thus demonstrate the firmness of the high resolve of the bodhisattvas. Why? Reverend Mahakasyapa, the bodhisattvas demonstrate that firmness by means of terrible austerities. Ordinary persons have no power to be thus demanding of bodhisattvas, unless they are granted the opportunity. They are not capable of killing and depriving in that manner without being freely given the chance.

I am pretty sure none of you think that Naropa let Tilopa abuse him to the point of death without Naropa getting some realisation, some awakening in the process. That would be very stupid on his part and I think we all know that Naropa wasn't stupid.

Malcolm wrote:
1) Naropa was already an advanced Vajrayāna practitioner when he sought out Tilopa.

2) Naropa did not realize buddhahood, because in the end, he disobeyed Tilopa over the issue of debating Hindus.

3) Tilopa did not actually personally abuse Naropa. He put Naropa in situations where Naropa acted out his egotism and got into trouble as a result.

4) These stories are comparatively rare. In fact, in the entire history of the Sakya tradition, filled with masters who attained the highest realizations, none of these stories exist. I cannot think of any similar stories in the Gelug, Jonang, or Nyingma traditions either. For some reason, however, the Kagyu tradition's take on guru devotion, using Tilopa/Naropa, Marpa/Mila narratives, is frankly unhealthy and leads students the wrong way. I also cannot think of any stories like this in the Kagyu tradition following Milarepa, in fact. So why do Tibetans and westerners constantly invoke the Tilopa/Naropa refrain? It makes no sense and merely promotes a sense that if you guru does not beat you, you are not making progress. Beyond this, there is the fact that Milarepa story is a complete fiction, as the research of Peter Alan Roberts clearly shows based on the earliest bios of Milarepa.

For example, let us take the case of Virupa. Virupa was a monk, Shri Dharmapāla, abbot of Nalanda, who practiced Vajrayogini for twenty years. He thought he was not getting anywhere. So one night he decided to quit and tossed his māla in the toilet. He had a dream of Nairatma, and she told him that he had erred, and that he needed to retrieve his māla from the latrine and wash it. You see, he had received empowerments of Cakrasamvara, but his master had died before Dharmapāla could receive intimate instructions related to experiences on the path. So he misinterpreted his experiences of heat on the path of application, and further, he was practicing the wrong yidam. So the next day, he encountered nirmanakāya Nairatma and her band of yoginīs, received the Hevajra empowerment and instructions, and achieved one bodhisattva bhumi after another for six consecutive nights, realizing the sixth bhumi. Now, Virupa was definitely a crazy yogi, everywhere he went he challenged people's expectations, but he did it with kindness, not anger— though when he reversed the Ganges, he might have flooded a hut or two, and when he stopped the sun in the sky, he might have damaged some crops. In his dealings with Dombhi Heruka and Kanha, it is recorded he showed them nothing but kindness. It is well known that among the 84 mahāsiddhas, when it came to manifesting magical powers, Virupa was the greatest. Finally, people became a little too freaked out by Virupa's displays of power, so Avalokiteshvara intervened and asked Virupa to stop. Of course Virupa assented, having converted thousands of Hindus to Buddhadharma and the practice of Avalokiteshvara in particular, and when he passed, it is recorded that he dissolved his physical body into a statue of Avalokiteshvara in South India. The point of all of this is that there is more than one model of guru/disciple relationships.

Another of the root downfalls is causing people to lose faith in the Dharma. You are going to have to explain to me exactly how it is that promulgation of these few narratives does Vajrayāna more good than harm, considering they are exceptions and not the rule.

And further, those of us who extol such stories as that of Tilo and Naro, think carefully, could you handle Tilopa as your guru? And if you answer honestly, you will admit there is no way you can handle this. And if you can't handle this, for what reason do you hold this up as an ideal model of a guru and student relationship?

We're talking as if the branding of Jetsun Shuksep by Lama Pema Gyatsho was a great transgression and a crime against females. Having been Jetsun Shuksep's student in my last life and one of Her present Tulku's shabji for almost 20 years in this life, I don't see it that way. Just with Marpa and Milarepa, I feel quite confident that Jetsun Shuksep would've said Lama Pema Gyatsho's acts were skillful means for the purification of Her bad karma. Did She suffer terribly? Of course She did. Besides branding, She was kicked out of Her Teacher's community, beaten, and told to walk naked around the Barkor. But She was willing to undergo these trials for the sake of Enlightenment. If, within Vajrayana, these were considered wrong or shameful acts on the part of Her Guru, they would not have been included in Her namthar. Her namthar is a record of Her Liberation and everything in it is meant as a description of what led to that Liberation. Would I like to be branded on my forehead? No way... but then I don't have Jetsun Shuksep's bravery and perseverance on the path to Liberation.

We moderns (with our liberal, humanist, relativist views) need to understand that the Vajrayana is an inherently dangerous path where all safety nets have been discarded. There are no limits to what a real Guru might do to insure the Liberation of Their student. In Alexandra David-Neel's Magic & Mystery in Tibet, there's a story where she comes across a Lama whose student is practicing chod every night and is so scared that David-Neel cautions the Lama that the student is on the verge of dying. The Lama says that the student has only to realize the inherent nature of his own mind and all fear will evaporate. The Teacher did not intervene in the student's nightly chod.

One of my own Teachers deliberately caused me immense mental and emotional pain. After years of suffering through this, She said that it was in order to insure that my mind stayed in the View every minute of every day. Harsh? Absolutely. But don't hang out with Wisdom Dakinis (a.k.a. Mamos) if you can't take the heat.

Chatral Rinpoche, one of this Teacher's Root Gurus, was also famous for doing outrageous things, making outrageous requests of students. There is a well-known story of Chatral Rinpoche shitting on a plate and asking a Western student who was requesting teachings on one taste to eat that shit. The student decided he didn't need those teachings after all. Another time, a Tibetan disciple of Chatral Rinpoche was near death. This disciple (or former disciple) had broken samaya which had never been confessed and repaired. Seeing the writing on the wall, he was now afraid he was going to Narme Hell. He invited Chatral Rinpoche out to a fashionable restaurant and bought Him dinner. He said how sorry he was and asked if Chatral Rinpoche would pardon him. Chatral Rinpoche told the man to offer absolutely every single one of his possessions to Him. If I remember correctly, the man ran out of the restaurant. I was told this story by Jetsun Shuksep's Tulku as an example of how serious Vajryana samaya is as well as how, as a Vajrayana Guru, Chatral Rinpoche "played for keeps." Today, everyone likes to say they were a student of Chatral Rinpoche. But the truth is that, for years, most people stayed away from Chatral Rinpoche out of fear.

Similar with Kunzang Dorje Rinpoche Whose bio was recently posted on this site in another thread. I personally know a well-known Western Dharma practitioner who asked Kunzang Dorje to become His student. Kunzang Dorje took out a piece of copper wire, straightened it out a bit, and told this Westerner to insert it up his penis. The Westerner decided he was needed elsewhere.

Then there's Kusum Lingpa Who gleefully shoplifted in drag while His students shuddered in a combination of embarassment and fear of being immanently arrested. And that's only one example of this Teacher's outrageous, iconoclastic behavior.

My point being, if you (we, me) are not willing to risk everything on the Vajrayana path, maybe you/we/me should not follow this path. The pervasive contemporary attempt to water down the Vajrayana to make it palatable to us moderns and profitable to its purveyors risks, as one of my Dharma brothers recently wrote, turning it into "Tibetan Presbyterianism." The 84 Mahasiddhas of India did not tell Their Gurus what They could and couldn't do in terms of Their teaching methods.

Many people gravitate to Gurus who are always nice, always kind, always "compassionate" in our everyday version of that word. We pick Gurus who we like and are easy to get along with, Who we are comfortable with. For some of us, this is all we can handle. But when you're with a highly Realized Teacher, it can be very, very scary. To Them, this world is a fiction, a dream, an illusion, and Their job is to wake us up out of that fiction as quickly and completely as possible. For this kind of Teacher, nothing is "off the table" in terms of skillful means. When confronted with this sort of Teacher, you may not be able to take the heat.

I totally understand the problem with sexual abuse that is causing so much anguish and upsetment in our Tibetan Buddhist world. One of my own Teachers was well-known for having sex with His female students. So I have some first-hand experience of this situation. But I would caution we Tantrikas to be very careful in jumping to pervasive modernist conclusions about all this. It is very, very difficult to tell who is a true Guru and who is not, and our tightly cherished notions of right and wrong don't apply in the world of the Swift Path. That's what makes Vajrayana so damn dangerous. This path is not for everyone. The fact that it's being marketed to everyone without the proper warning labels on the side of the package is part of the degenerations of the Kali Yuga.

I'm sure I'm going to catch flak for this post, but, in my opinion and experience, this whole situation is not as easy and straightforward as many seem to think. For anyone thinking about entering the Vajrayana, all I can say is caveat emptor.

I can't find the reference - if someone knows it please let me know - but there is an text talking about this that says that that if the guru breaches samaya then there's no way of mending it, both guru and disciple are going to vajra hell.

It is possible, however, to decide that the guru was unqualified and therefore samaya never existed in the first place. In some of the recent scandals that's a completely reasonable conclusion to reach. If that happens then - to use an analogy - it's an annulment rather than a divorce.

If "leaving" your guru means you no longer contact or seek teachings from them, that doesn't have to entail any breach of samaya, provided you maintain pure perception of them, and avoid negative speech and actions with respect to them.

Likely his report of past use combined with the current situation. Like I said, he could just be abusive too, but when a guy who has had trouble with alcohol in the past is the center of an abuse scandal..well, it'd almost be surprising if indeed he -had- successfully quit or significantly cut down.

Additionally, an alcoholic" does not need to drink heavily to have a problem, some people have major problems (e.g. abusive/dangerous/destructive behavior etc.) without drinking that much. It's the loss of control, and the use despite persistent negative consequences that defines it, not simply how much someone drinks.

I got a message and photo to Ponlop Rinpoche and he did prayers for him. Tonight we will have tonglen session with the many old Vajradhatu members here and even some who did not know him. Giovanina is leading this session

Sensitivity warning:
This post is about suicide...

My heart is broken and my condolences go out to all that knew Bill, his family his followers, folks on his blog and his friends and his Sangha.

Between the recent passing of our friends Kunga Dawa and more recently Zanto aka Terry Mason we are being reduced to the basic common denominator: being Alone. And now to think my dear poet friend and heart connection has taken his life as some sacrifice of self-immolation amidst the utter disheartening news of our Shambhala Sangha rife with sexual misconduct and the stepping down of the Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche and all of the Kalapa Council.

Our world is changing, our lives are changing but the teachings of the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha, our three jewels will still shine through because the recipe has been handed down in our lineage and the bread has been baked fresh as the Vidyadhara used to say.

May Karuna and Prajna continue to lead us and uplift us in these dark dark moments. 'Although I live in the slime and muck of the dark age, I still aspire to see your face. Although I live in the thick black fog of materialism, I still aspire to see your face.'

Grigoris said:
I remember 15 years.

I don't think 5 years is enough.

For example:  I was following one teacher (my Refuge lama) for about 7 years.  Then one day I asked if he could impart an empowerment (he is authorised to) and he started to say some stuff about not wanting to form those sorts of links with students, etc...  Why would I want a teacher that is not willing to risk seriously devoting themselves to their students?  I had to travel to the other side of Greece for almost a decade to take teachings from him, I invited him and put in up in my home, etc...  Not only me, but other people in the group he was teaching to.  So it seemed kind of weird to me that he was not willing to put in the effort...

So I started looking for another teacher.

I am with my current teacher 3 years now and am in no rush to take him as my guru yet, since I do not think it is long enough.  I am willing to wait another 7+ years before completely devoting myself, I prefer this to rushing in and regretting the decision and then racking myself with guilt, or pointing fingers, as seems to be the fashion right now.

This may be your own view, but I don't think this is always the best way to go. If you are fortunate enough to find a teacher that you have a good degree of faith and trust in, then I think that this is a must in terms of the relationship one has developed thus far with that particular teacher. As you also said, it is a matter of respect but much more than that. If you truly trust them then although you may not like the answer they give, you have to have trust that they have your best interest at heart. Of course, this is where it can get tricky but time and time again we have been advised to investigate those teachers with whom we wish to enter such a relationship with.

In my case, I did exactly such a thing. I explained to my guru that I felt a close connection to a particular cycle from a different lineage, that I wished to receive the appropriate empowerments and transmissions, and from whom. In my case he did agree and gave me his blessing. I couldn't imagine approaching the situation any other way to be honest.

Given the mindset required for day-trading, it doesn't seem very compatible with Dharma practice. Actual jobs where you leave home & interact with other humans require positive attitudes & behaviours such as teamwork, a pleasant demeanour, being responsive & non-judgemental when dealing with clients/customers particularly when you're advocating on their behalf.

Whereas daytrading seems based on avarice, pure & simple - even if such endeavours are conducted in the service of one's Dharma practice, surely the seeds of desiring to accumulate wealth would be prominent in one's daily motivation.

It's always amused and horrified me how Westerners, particularly Americans, manage to merge the Dharma into their capitalist worldview. Looking at you, Shambhala and Rigpa!

Roughly a handful of years ago the Dalai Lama reiterated his support for communism as a political system that distributes abundance in a more equitable fashion - people at the Vajradhatu Sun seemed bewildered at this and wrote an editorial, if memory serves, along the lines of "what on earth is the Dalai Lama talking about, we don't get it, do you?"

From how it was explained to me, apparently some years back Osel Mukpo was frustrated at how lots of older Trungpa students would have several teachers and would come to the Scorpion Seal Garchens but then end up doing their own thing or not engaging with his teachings enough. It then seems like he asked folks to prioritize him as a teacher if they were coming to the retreats, and then they highly discourage or outright forbid newer students from having other teachers. I wonder what would happen to someone who already has multiple teachers and wants to engage with Shambhala's restricted teachings. In either case, it doesn't seem like this is a totally followed by everybody, as I know that some folks like Ethan Nichtern have other teachers (or seem to at least), but it's definitely a thing.

I remember when I mentioned I was interested in Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche to my meditation instructor at the time, I got severe backlash and the whole spiel about needing to commit to one path wholeheartedly. There was this idea that if you have anything more than one teacher, you're trying to walk two paths simultaneously, that you're basically dilly-dallying and not committing and that your practice will never go anywhere. While I can understand the argument of lacking focus, it felt really negative and unnecessary at the time and that's more or less when my split really started to crystallize.

Yet when we look closely at the men described as serious and serial offenders—the ones indicted or convicted of sexual crimes (Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Larry Nassar), or the ones accused of being repeat predators, gropers and exhibitionists (among them Louis C.K., Steve Wynn, Mark Halperin, Kevin Spacey, James Levine)—there’s also something strangely stylized about their behavior. It’s as if they were following a script available only to them, their victims forced to improvise in an awful, repetitive drama. The hotel rooms. Their surprise appearance in a bathrobe. (So many men have reportedly relied on the unbelted robe, from Weinstein to Charlie Rose to architect Richard Meier, that it could now be called the pervert’s uniform.) And the masturbation! So much masturbation! Behind desks, on women’s legs, inside their own pants. Their alleged predations are shocking in their brazenness, breadth and damage: At least 85 women have accused Weinstein; more than 50 have accused Cosby; more than 200 have accused writer-director James Toback. At Nassar’s sentencing, prosecutors identified more than 265 victims.
...

The therapists also describe a pattern of sexual behavior called “avoidant attachment.” People with avoidant attachment patterns, they write, often have difficulty forming adult relationships. Even if these individuals are in a primary romantic relationship, they are more likely to seek sex elsewhere. Meanwhile, people with unconventional turn-ons may feel shame or embarrassment, so they avoid exploring their desires with a partner, preferring the reliability of masturbation. They can engage in out-of-control sexual behavior to regulate the threat of emotional closeness. Or, as Morin wrote, “Lust is most likely to turn destructive when it is split off from the rest of life, where it festers and grows hostile.”

Personally I think there isn't necessarily an automatic agreement between traditional Buddhism and Western liberal and libertarian philosophies.  Identity politics itself, I would have thought, be hard to reconcile with Buddhist values. After all Buddhism originated as a renunciate philosophy, so  the notion of a 'constructed social identity' would not naturally align with that, as it is presumably amongst the things that is to be renounced.

Malcolm wrote:
And yet, Buddha appears to have spearheaded a movement that among other things, cast down brahmins. So there is a social and class aspect to Buddhism that cannot be ignored. There is clear evidence in the Hinayana canon of class prejudice and Buddha's negative reaction to it.

It's just that in the context of modern Western culture, Buddhism often appears as an alternative or counter-cultural movement, so naturally finds itself aligned with liberal and libertarian politics in the West, but I think traditional Buddhism could easily be more inclined much more towards social conservatism - as it sometimes is, for instance, in Japanese politics.

One night I received a call from his kusung at 11pm or 12pm saying that the Sakyong would like to see me and that I should come to his suite. I was thrilled and nervous. When I got there, he was dressed solely in a robe with no clothes underneath. We chatted for a while. Then he led me into his room and began kissing me and removing my clothes. I said that I couldn’t have sex with him. He seemed stunned. He thought for a while and then pushed my face down towards his penis and said “Well you might as well finish this.” I was so embarrassed and horrified I did it. He rolled over in bed and didn’t say another word to me.

Just as a point of clarification (I hope!) looking at Sakya Panditas Vajrayani Mula Pati (Dorje Thegpa Tsa-wa'i Tungwa) the First Branch Downfall is:

'If one takes on the path a consort who has not had the initiation, by relying on her as a mental object, one commits the first branch downfall.'

What this means is that if you are practicing completion stage Anuttarayoga such as the 'path of messengers' you cannot do this with the physical consort who has not received empowerments or with the mental image of them as the yidam.  Since for this practice you are relying on the consort it must be an appropriate one.

Malcolm wrote:
It is tempting to read it this way. But is not the case. If someone is engaged in HYT practice, it is not like they are allowed to put down their practice to engage in a bit of mundane sport, and then pick up their practice after having smoked a cigarette.

Gatinho said:
So the mistake would be to confuse ordinary sexual relations with yoga involving a consort.

Malcolm wrote:
Someone practicing inner tantra should never be involved in ordinary sexual relations. It is a downfall, easily repaired, but a downfall nevertheless. Since most people practice mother tantra, one should consult the 8 special samayas related to mother tantra.

Gatinho said:
Thus it is perfectly normal and pleasant to fall in love with a non-initiate, have a sexual relationship, feel the earth move, settle down, have children and argue over breakfast and so on but do not confuse this samsaric experience with the liberating effect of yoga tantra.  That would be the branch downfall.

This is how I read it.

You are entitled to your reading, but there is sufficient commentarial evidence contra this interpretation.

Sexual urges are not necessarily afflictive, anymore more than the urge to eat. One however need not act on sexual urges at all, or overindulge them in the case of lay people. Indeed, for practitioners, it is better to avoid having children, no matter what level of the Dharma one practices.

It is pretty clear that in Tibetan Buddhism there are any number of male teachers who are more than willing to exploit naive and unqualified female students.

I'm okay with not ever engaging in higher yoga practice, if that's what it takes.  I just find it slightly off putting that the Dharma, would be so rigid when it comes to something which has nothing to do with unkindness.

Forcing shops and hotels to sell to people is not liberalisation, it is compulsion, bullying pure and simpel.  You can't have different laws for different groups in that way ....... what if a Trump supporter, or an NRA supporter or an extreme IS fanatic wanted their message on a cake? Should they be able to sue if you refuse?

What if the message denigrates women, threatens murder of one etc. and you are a Vajrayana practitioner - should you be forced by law to write their message?

Should a B&B be forced to accept everyone in their own home, regardless? How would you like to be forced to take in a few Nazis?
Guess what - if I want to take my dog I find a place that welcomes dogs.  If I wanted to take kids, same applies.  If I want to smoke, same applies.

Here's the news - they can buy the sodding cake from someone else, and they can book a different B&B.

In times of huge UK social deprivation, money is being spent in schools on creating toilets or reconfiguring existing ones at huge cost for tiny kids who say yes when questioned if they would like gender transitioning. Meanwhile, other kids in the same school can't get food and teachers are being made redundant.

This isn't liberal.  THis is pandering to a tiny self-important minority at the expense of others, with no evaluation of cost/benefit or whose human rights need protecting the most.

Namaste DharmaChakra. To your original question. Firstly Brahman as per Advaita Vedanta cannot be conceptualized or named or brought into any idea. There is a way to understand how this works and is understood. It will depend on your understanding of Advaita Vedanta, there are many systems, the modern neo advaita is far from it.
Yes. Vijnana is not the same as Brahman vi is in insight or when mind turns inwards, to get experiential knowledge of what is Brahman, through vijnana, vijnana is indirect or state of consciousness when one acquires direct understanding/experience of the nature of brahma~Absolute Reality,
My understanding is that brahman cannot be directly experienced. "Direct experiences of brahman" are mithya, not paramartha satya. I guess you could make an argument for indirect experiences of brahman in the sense of everything (we experience) is, ultimately, brahman.

I think it's a mistake to abandon the idea of practising Highest Yoga Tantra in Western society because of the sexual misconduct of some prominent Teachers. Karmamudra has a specific purpose and is only meant to be engaged in after many generation and completion stage realisations have already been attained. HYT is also meant to be practised in the context of Sutra teachings on renunciation, compassion, bodhichitta and the correct view of emptiness. If HYT is practised with a firm foundation of Sutra then there is no danger of it being misused.

Furthermore, although karmamudra is practised in the common lineage of Mahamudra instructions, there are some lineages of Mahamudra instructions where it is not necessary, therefore it is possible to complete the path to enlightenment using solitary meditation with a wisdom mudra without an  action mudra at all.

Both partners, not just one. If both partners are experienced, they can easily tell.

Classically, in India, one would train a partner personally, taking them through Hinayāna, Mahāyāna, and finally present them to one's guru for abhisheka, and then support their training until they were sufficiently well trained to engage in karmamudra practice-- in the meantime one would rely on a jñānamudra.

Highest Yoga Tantra is a classification which incorporates 3 types of tantras. Karmamudra is a specific practice that looks like two people having sex.

It should be said that in order to accomplish karmamudra there are specific yogic accomplishments that the male should be able to demonstrate. If women knew what that was, and insisted he show proof he could do karmamudra beforehand, then there would be a whole lot less of this pretext being used.

His position is twofold:
1. Sogyal R’s students (most likely) do not have binding samaya with Sogyal R because of multiple reasons. So in his case the issue is moot.
2. However if they actually had formed authentic samaya, then they would have committed themselves to seeing everything he did as pure. This is a necessity component of HYT and not subject to western cultural review.

That being the case, and given the rampant abuse of that idea as a pretext for abuse, maybe best to not teach or practice HYT in the West. There aren’t enough highly realized lamas around anyway so that it can be done without double-think anyways.

During the time I spent in Dharmadhatu communities in the late '80's and early 90's, I witnessed an amazing amount of alcoholism in the Dharmadhatu culture. I have observed the same behavior in other communities, mostly Nyimgma, including Dzogchen Community (though here it is actively discouraged by Chogyal Namkhai Norbu). Alcoholism is a fairly widespread problem in Tibetan Buddhism, at least in the Nyingma tradition, and it leads to many of the problems we see here. I know of at least three Tibetan Buddhist teachers who have died due to problems related to drinking, including CTR. It is time we acknowledge that in some Tibetan Buddhist communities there is a very unhealthy relationship with alcohol. There are at least three translators that I know who are chronic alcoholics.

Both in terms of self and other and in terms of abstinence from intoxicants and sexual misconduct.

To the Shambhala Community:

I write to you with great sadness, tenderness, and a mind of self-reflection.

It is my wish for you to know that in my past there have been times when I have engaged in relationships with women in the Shambhala community. I have recently learned that some of these women have shared experiences of feeling harmed as a result of these relationships. I am now making a public apology.

In addition, I would like you to know that over the years, I have apologized personally to people who have expressed feeling harmed by my conduct, including some of those who have recently shared their stories. I have also engaged in mediation and h ealing practices with those who have felt harmed. Thus I have been, and will continue to be, committed to healing these wounds.

As the lineage holder of Shambhala, I want to demonstrate how we can move toward a culture of kindness in line with our legacy of teachings. Kindness can sometimes begin with acknowledging the ways we have harmed others, even if we did not intend to do so. Thus, with the strong support of my wife, the Sakyong Wangmo, I am now entering a period of self-reflection and listening. I have worked with, and at times struggled with, how to be a teacher and a human being. I have found that there is no easy solution to navigating these responsibilities. Like all of you, I am human and on the path. It is important to me that you know I am here, continuing to do my best. We

Above all, it is important to me that we continue to create a caring community where harm does not occur. It is my fervent wish that we be a community that relates to each other with compassion and kindness, so I have offered teachings and written practices to support such a culture. I want to encourage our community to completely immerse itself in caring and kindness. This is not easy work, and we cannot give up on each other. For me, it always comes back to feeling my own heart, my own humanity, and my own genuineness. It is with this feeling that I express to all of you my deep love and appreciation. I am committed to engaging in this process with you.


With love,

Sakyong Mipham Rinpoche

There is the argument, which has been mentioned in other similar threads, that you can tell whether something is actually 'crazy wisdom' by the results. If someone is hurt or  driven to suicide for example, it is not enlightened activity. This makes sense of course. On the other hand, I was just reminded of this sutra https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitak ... .than.html where many monks kill themselves because of a teaching by the Buddha. The circumstances are clearly different, but it seems to suggest that even enlightened activity can in some cases have terrible results for some.

Then again, I have no way of knowing what kind of activity what is described in the post is.

Tabi: Trigger warning–this is not a nice, devotional story about CTR.
The first time I met His Majesty Chögyam Trungpa Rincophe was at encampment in the late summer of 1983. I was attending a dathün (month long sitting practice) at Rocky Mountain Dharma Center. This retreat is supposed to be mostly silent, but I was never good at holding my tongue. During the retreat, some of my new friends and I plotted a raid on encampment, which was a military-style program that was simultaneously happening on the land. We decided to raid encampment and attempt to steal the flag. Our plan was simple: we could create a diversion and while the attention was on us, our cohorts would sneak around the perimeter and steal the flag. Three of us drove through the tori gates in a convertible blaring Michael Jackson’s Beat It while the rest tried to sneak around and steal the flag. We were all immediately caught and locked up in the stockade. CTR came by that night to check out the prisoners. I noticed that he flirted shamefully with all the women/girls who were in the lock-up and totally and completely ignored me.
But I really met CTR in the backyard wedding of sangha members in Boulder in late January of 1985. I had been prepped by the family I nannied for for weeks in advance of the wedding. It appeared to work because I caught CTR’s eye and he asked me to marry him the next day. Then there was so much activity! We had our charts read by Larry Laughlin who found the most “auspicious” day for our wedding. Given the tremendous constraints of marrying six women in a five months, there was some wiggle room with the dates. The first wedding I attended was Karen Lavin’s. Next was Valerie Lorig Sanford, which happened on May 10th. Then Lady Cynde Grieves married him on May 13, Wendy Friedman was on May 17th, I was the fifth on June 12th, Ciel followed on her 18th brithday, and then Agness had her wedding in December of 1985.
There was so much to be done–especially for me as a new student who only completed through level four Shambhala training. I received stroke, lungta and werma transmission. I read Born in Tibet, and studied the Letter of the Golden Key Which fulfills desire, The Golden Dot, The Letter of the Black Ashe, Sacred World, the Practice of Warriorship, and Court Vision and Practice. I was on the fast track to learning and absorbing everything he’d ever created. I studied the texts themselves as well as the commentaries. Our ceremonies required correctly answering a direct question from CTR and the preceptor, who in my case was the regent. (Mine was the only ceremony with him as the preceptor–people said I should be honored–but I was not.) We were told to study the Six Ways of Ruling in particular, as it was rumored this would be one of the questions.
When I wasn’t with CTR, I was completing my tasks as a nanny. And I was introduced to the Shambhala lodge with a party in my honor. I attended Karen, Cynde, Wendy and Valerie’s ceremonies prior to mine. These all happened at the court in Boulder. We had dinners together where we were taught elocution by both Ashley Playfair and Carolyn Gimian. We had one dinner with CTR and the five of us Sangyum (Karen, Cynde, Wendy, Val and I), where we were served white fish with bones in it, green peas and white rice, and copious amounts of sake. We were learning how to eat like the British–holding our fork upside down in our left hand and our knife in the right to shovel the food onto the fork, not an easy task with that meal. During meals we usually played the qualities game, a parlor game CTR enjoyed.
One day I arrived at the court for a shift and I was told I was to receive another transmission from Marty Janowitz. I assumed this was to be like the others, perhaps he was giving me TGS transmission early. Marty told me this transmission was extremely sacred and was only known to a few close students. He then pulled out a vial filled with a white powdery substance. Marty told me it was ground up vitamin D or something. (I really can’t remember exactly what he said it was). He put a bit of it on the spoon and told me to rub it on my gums, which I did. It was not cocaine. It was part of our job description to always carry a vial of “Tabi” which was the code name for cocaine. Due to his paralysis, CTR only had the use of one hand, so when he called for tabi it was our job to go into the bathroom with him, keep him steady, help him get his penis out before he wet his pants and put the coke on a spoon for him to inhale. It was also our job to keep his nose clean, and as you can tell from the picture, we were not always successful. Later, when I went to the bathroom alone, I put some on my gums. It was definitely cocaine.
This is another secret I have kept for over 30 years. I can no longer keep it. I believe it is not of benefit to anyone to keep this secret anymore. I believe it’s important for the followers of Shambhala to know what really happened in the “inner circle” of the court. We all–every one of us–didn’t know how to say “no” to CTR. We were so busy tripping over each other to do his bidding that we never questioned why an enlightened mediation master would need copious amounts of cocaine and alcohol every day. We never questioned why he spoke of every woman or young girl in sexual terms. It was supposed to be a great honor to sleep with him. No one wondered if his sexual appetite for his female students might be unhealthy.
I started wondering about it shortly after Ciel’s suicide. Could this sexualized idea of women be unhealthy? Could this lack of boundaries eventually result in rage and self-hatred? Why did I think marrying a man with seven other wives, a serious drug addiction, alcoholism and suicidal tendencies shown as severe bulimia would be a good idea? I was 23 and vulnerable. And I said yes. Yes, I will do this strange thing. It was only later when I learned of power differentials and feminism that I truly understood how totally wrong it all was. And now I am triggered by all things Tibetan. I will never enter Karma Dzong again. It’s too painful to see the hero worship and the enshrinement of this deeply disturbed man. And for those of you who might have spent a few nights with him or more and feel they knew all there was to know about him, I ask you to dig deeper. And for those of you who never met him yet still follow his teachings, you might want to ask hard questions of those in the know.
The most shocking thing for me through this whole process of sharing my truth is the sheer number of people who are lying now, and denying that sexualized violence has a negative effect on women. This continued minimization of the real, undeniable scars that are left from sexual assault and harassment is shocking. Shambhala has had choices every step of the way since we have begun talking about the neglect and child rape and abuse that is the legacy CTR left his close students. And this deplorable view of women continues through his sons. Time’s Up Now.

In Kamtsang Bernakchen and Palden Lhamo most often practiced together.  There are several forms of Mahakala that are Yabyum, of course.  So it's seems pretty clear that Enlightened protectors can have consorts.

There are worldly protectors, as well, that have consorts, as noted here.  In fact, some worldly protectors have taken practitioners as consorts.  That's about all I'll say about the matter.....I'd recommend not messing with Worldly protectors in general, unless you've accomplished the siddhi of your yidam, etc.

Mantrik said:
Thanks.
I wasn't aware of that Mahakala practice.  I assume Maning is exempted, being 'gender unified'.
Hmm...did I just invent a new category for gender discrimination activists?

Yes,  we should have no interaction with any Dharmapala practices unless guided by a Guru we can trust.

If this is practiced, all will be liberated;
there is no distinction between sharp and dull capacity.
If one practices, even a cowherd will be liberated.
If one understands the significance of the luminosity of one’s mind
through a direct perception,
the rhetoric of scholars is not necessary here;

there is no need for an explanation of the taste of sugar.

Johnny Dangerous said:
Can you explain the Bon position here? I am not sure I understand it, do they assert different Buddhahoods, are simply claim that vehicle below Dzogchen do not lead to full Buddhahood?
From footnotes: Translation and commentary by Lopon Tenzin Namdak, “Heart Drops Of Dharmakaya“

….Mahamudra is the union of emptiness and bliss, and as Tsongkhapa explained very clearly the emptiness referred to is that of the Madhyamika view; this is not the view of emptiness referred to in Dzogchen.
Many schools have terms and propositions which are very similar to those of Dzogchen, and this has led to some confusion when this label has been applied to other systems. For example, Sakya Pandita was very explicit in condemning Dzogchen as not being a Buddhist view at all. All the Dzogchen texts make special mention of the need to separate out all the other views in order to make clear the meaning of the terms in the context of Dzogchen alone.
At the very beginning you must know the other views, but they are to be discarded as this is the highest and best vehicle. Many Dzogchen teachers at present are teaching that Mahamudra and Madhyamika and Dzogchen views are not different. But this is not found in the literature at all.

Many teachings seem very similar to Dzogchen, but all teachings are bounded by thought. If you go back to their origin there are always precepts that say this is the right way and that is the wrong way. Once you have this background you are bounded by thoughts. But Dzogchen has no background; this is difficult to explain as everything Dzogchen says is for the practitioner with capacity. This difference of view is very important to understand.

Lopon comments that this means not hesitating or meditating, and this is why many Buddhist masters criticized Dzogchen. For example, Tsongkhapa asserted that the natural state in Dzogchen is just like being unconscious. Far from that, this awareness is very bright and clear. But the Indian commentators on the Prajnaparamita, such as Nagarjuna, did not understand this awareness that is present after thoughts have stopped. They do recognise something similar, the undeluded direct cognition of sunyata (void). This cognition is inseparable from its object and undeluded; but it is not the same.

"But according to this system we don't accept any teachings of theirs; we don't think that their teachings are either good or bad—we don't care. Why? Because we are completely outside of the judgement of their points. There is no point in arguing or judging; we don't care. Like the elephant—if he is thirsty no one can stop him from going to the water! All these different views have been bounded by thought and so are grasping."

In Mahamudra, for example, the body disappears and the illusory body is realized. It is not that the physical becomes the illusory body; the physical body dies as in the normal case but the mind realizes the illusory body.

The Bonpo philosophy has a background completely independent of the Indian and is much earlier. Later it found its way to India and the Indians accepted some of its concepts.

haha said:
It can provide his basic assertions. You can check more on that book or on other sources.
Probably, it is uniqueness of the Bonpo Dzogchen as they hold such position. It also shows the different aspects in Buddhist Dzogchen and Bonpo Dzogchen, even though they both share similar terminology, methods and theory. Everyone likes to hold his or her position is correct, and others are mistaken. It is natural.

That said, I have been wondering the stance that sutrayana takes three incalculable eons to attain perfect Buddhahood is the view of Tantrayana or that is the view of sutrayana itself.

The point is whether one can achieve buddhahood in one lifetime or not.

Answer by DKR: Can. There are various methods to attain rainbow body, it can also be attained by practicing six or ten paramitas, even if one practices the Mahayana bodhisattva path, rainbow body can similarly be attained.

Malcolm, how would resultant Mahamudra be presented in the Kagyu fold compared to Sakya or Gelug? Is this due to using Gompopas four yogas or Ganges Mahamudra upadesha as explanation?

Basis of Mahamudra, or Dzogchen is same. Path is different; it is different because of different inclination of sentient beings. Sentient beings have different disposition; so the path is different in that respect.  Result is the same; that is attaining Complete Buddhahood; not only rainbow body. Inclining to different path does not change the base; fruition is just full development of potentiality of the base. (PO)

But CNNR, “Dzogchen Teachings”
The Sutra teaching has never recognized rigpa as explained in the Dzogchen teaching.

....This is why Madhyamika, which is a philosophical system, negates the existence of the Base completely. In Dzogchen, the Base does not mean a concrete object or concept, but rather our real condition.

People who have learned a little about Sutra and then study the Dzogchen teaching often confuse the Base in Dzogchen with the concept of the "base" in the Yogachara system. The Yogachara system uses the term kunzhi, kun meaning "all," and zhi meaning "base."

…the Yogachara scholars posited the kunzhi, the "base of all," where karma-producing seeds, as potentiality, are maintained. They considered that the base exists for this purpose.
Nagarjuna refuted the Yogachara concept of kunzhi and never accepted it. He could not understand the Dzogchen view of the Base, and thus his Madhyamika philosophy rejected that as well.

In Tantra there is the idea that something is transformed into something else, and that concept is fundamental to Tantric practice.
The idea of impure and pure vision is absent right from the beginning in the process of learning about Dzogchen.
Jamgön Kongtrul said that Mahamudra corresponds to the Semdé teachings of Dzogpachenpo. ( rigpawiki )
If that is the case how can one get the fruit of Dzogchen Upadesh by practicing just Mahamudra(i.e. similar to semde)?

Machiavelli smiles from the grave.

As for Trump, the supposed success of the summit after the debacle in Quebec appeals to innate love of drama. He is where he loves to be: at the center of a stunned world’s attention.

But he is also in the place where he always gets himself, and everyone else in his orbit, into the worst trouble: panting for the object of his desire.

I have read LTN's arguments on the matter but i am still unclear on  the reasons why he believes that there are differences in results.
Anyway, he clearly rejects the idea that the budhahoods of sutra and tantra are indentical to that of dzogchen.
But he says something interesting about the reason why some might think that tantra and mahamudra is identical with dzogchen. He thinks that it has something to do with the way the rime movement of Kongtrul and Wangpo was influenced by the dzogchen view and how in the end, these days, most kagyu people would present their teaching as dzogchen when in actuality is just the mahamudra of Gampopa, system that  was severely criticised by Sakya Pandita and other scholars.

"Body of light" mentioned by Sachen Kunga Nyingpo in Chakrasamvara, as Malcolm mentioned, refers to the second type which the body shrink in size or disappeared but it is not the first type of Great Transference Body.

@Kalden Yungdrung & @Malcolm

Hi guys,
Could it be that we have some semantic problem here?
Do Bönpo, Nyingma & Sarma really refer to exactly the same thing when they speak of Mahamudra ?
As far as Madhyamika is concerned  and (as little as I know) “Bön Madhyamika” is very close / similar to “Guelug Madhyamika”... Hence the strong “critic” from the point of view of “Bön Dzogchen”. However does that critic really apply to the “Nyingma Madhyamika” as well ? Not sure at all...

Could there be something similar going on here in this disussion about Mahamudra ?

@Malcolm specifically:
Don’t Nyingma Dzogchen Tantras ever claim some uniqueness to the fruit of Dzogchen ?
Isn’t it said that 10th Bhumi = “Sutra Buddhahood” / 13th Bhumi = “Tantra Buddhood” / 16th Bhumi = “Dzogchen Buddhahood” ?
Thx

Malcolm wrote:
Hi Marc, there is no result higher than anuttarasamyaksambuddhahood.

The thirteenth Bhumi described in Nyingma texts is not the same as the thirteenth Bhumi described in sarma tantras, where it is the equivalent of the Nyingma 16th Bhumi.

As we have seen above, it is the opinion of Buddhist masters that the result of mahamudra (two stages) and Dzogchen are the same.

My memory may mislead me, but if I'm not mistaken I remember ChNN stating that the body of light attained in certain other traditions doesn't equal the rainbow body, which as stated previously is uncommon for dzogchen standards too. Many great dzogchen masters did not manifest rainbow body despite their high level of realization.
So if the result of dzogchen, mahamudra and what else particular vajrayana tradition one reckons to be ultimate would be the same, why emphasize the particular methods associated with it as well as its rather rare occurance?
Also from a dzogchen point of view the base is defined in different ways in the context of trekchod and thogal: from that angle one might as well stated that although the base is the same, the 'depth' (I think the texts talk of gting in tibetan if my memory doesn't fail) of understanding is different, hence the path is different, so why exclude a different 'depth' in the result?

In Mahayana, the realization of Arhats is not the same as the realization of Bodhisattvas, much less a SamyaksamBuddha..howver, both categores (Hinayana and Mahayana) are labelled "Sutra"...so I don't think the above really addresses the issue. Even Mahayana Sutras such as the Lankavatara etc. express that the realization of Arhats is not the same as those who have entered the Mahayana path, therefore, including this argument does not make sense to me, as everyone would agree that Arhats do not share this realization, minus Theravadins. Obviously, on a Mahayana forum you will probably find pretty consistent agreement on this point.

CNNr speaking about anuyoga says the following:
"....when they arrive at the ultimate stage or arrival point of their transformation practice, they call it Dzogchen. The ultimate stage or arrival point of Anuyoga, they call Dzogchen. Whereas the arrival point or ultimate stage of all of Mahayoga, that is, all of the path of transformation which proceeds through gradual visualization, is always called Mahamudra. It is clear that this changes nothing since the ultimate point in Mahamudra and  Dzogchen are one and the same thing. But the path taken to arrive there, the method used, are not the same............
......Many people often ask "'What's the difference between Dzogchen and Mahamudra?" Certainly when one has fully grasped it and  finds oneself in that state, whether we call it of Dzogchen or of  Mahamudra, then there's no difference. But we've ahead, understood  that the way of getting there, the method, is a different one. Sometimes we find in the songs, for example of the Mahasiddhas who practiced Mahamudra, we find that they're saying the very same things as Dzogchen. They're saying the principles of Dzogchen. But it's not said that necessarily they're using terms that are Dzogchen or that are necessarily Mahamudra. They may be using terms that come from still another source like the Madhyamika philosophy. Knowledge is always knowledge of the same principle. But the methods, the techniques of getting there, are all different. Nor are we to understand, when we speak of different  methods, that one is better quality, one is less good quality. Nothing of that kind. But it is extremely important to discriminate  and understand the characteristics of particular methods. Otherwise  you can't use them. You muddle them. So here we're talking the  viewpoint of Dzogchen, the way of seeing of Dzogchen, and it says  "Everybody from the very beginning, all beings, ate totally illuminated.........."

EPA Targets Already Depleted Bee Population
Agency Close to Approving Mass Pesticide Spraying That Will Harm Helpful Insects

The administrator of Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency is now taking steps that could promote expanding the use of insecticides that are helping befuddle and kill off bees.

Neonicotinoids, the world’s most popular insecticides, affect the central nervous systems of insects, causing paralysis and death. The European Union imposed a partial ban on three neonicotinoids in 2013 because of the harm the insecticides can do to bees and butterflies that pollinate plants. Honeybee colonies have fallen by 59% in North America.

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt is considering allowing a type of neonicotinoid, thiamethoxam, manufactured by Syngenta, to be sprayed directly on about 165 million acres of wheat, barley, corn, sorghum, alfalfa, rice and potatoes. Thiamethoxam is currently used as a seed coating.

“If the EPA grants Syngenta’s wish, it will spur catastrophic declines of aquatic invertebrates and pollinator populations that are already in serious trouble,” said Lori Ann Burd, director of the Center for Biological Diversity’s environmental health program.

Former President Barack Obama ordered the EPA in 2014 to assess the effect of pesticides, including neonicotinoids, on bees and other insects that pollinate plants. The EPA has been evaluating imidacloprid and clothianidin, manufactured by Bayer; thiamethoxam; dinotefuran, developed by Mitsui Chemicals; and acetamiprid, sold by Nisso Chemical.

Trump met with Bayer CEO Werner Baumann before he even took office, and a former lobbyist for the pesticide industry, Rebeckah Adcock, is now a top official at the Department of Agriculture. CropLife America, the trade group for the pesticide industry, has spent about $1.9 million on federal lobbying so far in 2017.

Syngenta CEO Erik Fyrwald has defended his company’s pesticides.

“There are numerous things impacting bee health,” Fyrwald said. “One of the very minor elements there is pesticides.”

The Trump-Pruitt EPA, which has decided it is OK to use pesticides that cause brain damage in children,  was reluctant under Obama to take action on neonicotinoids. In January, the agency released draft risk reviews of dinotefuran, clothianidin and thiamethoxam that downplayed potential risks of the pesticides to bees.

Syngenta’s proposal was released on the same day in December that the EPA also released new assessments of risks from neonicotinoids to aquatic insects.

The Natural Resources Defense Council sued the EPA and EPA administrator Scott Pruitt in October, saying the agency hadn’t evaluated the impact of neonicotinoids on threatened and endangered species. The lawsuit claimed that the EPA violated the Endangered Species Act by approving products containing neonicotinoids without consulting federal wildlife officials on the potential risks to endangered species.

In other words, he did so in order to defend the Gelug school.

For individuals, some try to ignore, some try to incorporate, some try to refute, some conclude Tsongkhapa's position was completely wrong and start studying Dzogchen or whatever. The Geshes I study with, if asked say that they haven't studied it and so can't give an opinion - at most, they say it's contrary to Tsongkhapa and Gelug explanations.  Our Geshe from Sera Je is far more concerned with refuting particular points of explanation that differentiate Sera Je from Sera Mey or Drepung Loseling and Drepung Gomang.

beings into the centre of a mountain of pieces of red-hot iron, glowing
like live coals. They whip up the flames with bellows of tiger and

Their suffering is tremendous. Apart from the cries of distress,
there is no longer any indication of the presence of actual bodies.
They constantly long to escape, but it never happens. Sometimes there is
a small gap in the fire and they think they can get out, but the workers
hit them with spears, clubs, hammers and other weapons and they are
subjected to all the agonies of the seven previous hells, such as having
molten bronze poured into their mouths.

Lifespan here is a whole intermediate kalpa. It is called the Hell of
Ultimate Torment because there could be no worse torment elsewhere.

The error of mundane, conventionally-valid perception is to believe that entities have natures, when in fact they do not, being phenomena that arise from conditions. It is quite easy to show a worldly person the contradiction in their thinking. Wetness and water are not two different things; therefore wetness is not the nature of water. Heat and fire are not two different things, therefore, heat is not the nature of fire, etc. For example, one can ask them, "Does wetness depend on water, or water on wetness?" If they claim wetness depends on water, ask them, where is there water that exists without wetness? If they claim the opposite, that water depends on wetness, ask them, where is there wetness that exists without water? If there is no wetness without water nor water without wetness, they can easily be shown that wetness is not a nature of water, but merely a name for the same entity under discussion. Thus, the assertion that wetness is the nature of water cannot survive analysis. The assertion of all other natures can be eliminated in the same way.

Of this line, Candra's autocommentary states:

The key point here is that the entities that the worldly perceive are not analyzed, and thus in this way, they are established only prior to analysis.

But this is not an argument that conventionally valid entities possess natures.

Indeed, in in the root text, Candra states very clearly:

Likewise, entities lack a nature (rang bzhin) indeed,
but saying "existence" is shown to be the provisional meaning.

And:

The absence of a nature in phenomena
is the so-called emptiness shown by the wise.

Bhavaviveka agrees in the Blaze of Reasoning:

Once it is accepted that that entities do not arise intrinsically (rang bzhin gyis), they are termed "non-arisen." Since the truth is the absence of a nature (rang bzhin med), nothing arises intrinsically (rang bzhing gyis).

It really isn't. In dreams phenomena have their own individual natures. These natures exist only for the dreamer because they are mere appearances to the dreaming mind.

Malcolm wrote:
What do you mean by "nature?" Most people mean something that is intrinsic to a given thing. For example, common people assume the nature of fire is heat, the nature of water is wetness, and so on.

Bhavaviveka, etc., do not accept that things have natures. If they did, they could not be included even in Mahāyāna, let alone Madhyamaka.

Anders said:
AFAIK Vajra hell is a special feature of Vajrayana - only practitioners who break samaya in ways gruelling enough to go there can end up in the vajra hells, which is below even avici (although I believe there are some who say that it is more like an aspect of the avici hells).

Aryjna said:
Avici and the vajra hell are the same thing. You can read more about it in Words of my perfect teacher.

Fortyeightvows said:
I don't have that text available now, but I'll check it out later.
It seems to me though that avici hell and vajra hell wouldn't be the same thing because ordinary people and those who do the five major sins can end up there. On the other hand, vajra hell is usually conceived of as being specifically or only or particularly for vajrayana practitioners who have broken samaya.

I don't want a tiny statue as it would look odd next to my very large buddha statues so I've been looking at similar sized kwan yin statues online, very eye watering prices attached to them ranging from $399 to $799 for a 16" figure. So I was thinking about sculpting my own, I'm no artist but I did dabble with sculpting in clay when I was younger. Is it ok to put a homemade image on a shrine table is it disrespectful?

Why are nearly all the contemporary Dzogchen masters known in the Western world, not to mention a large proportion of Nyingma and Kagyu lamas in general, from Eastern Tibet?  Especially from the region of Kham, it seems.  There are exceptions, but name a lama in one of these traditions and odds are they're from Kham.

Does this date specifically from the Rimé (eclectic/non-sectarian) movement, whose major exponents were from Kham, or was this a trend even before the 19th century?  I recall reading that Kham has been relatively diverse in terms of lineages for many years.

I'm also wondering whether it's that proportionally more Kham lamas are teaching in exile, due to the burden of the Chinese occupation falling especially heavily on Eastern Tibet?  I don't know if that's true.  Maybe there are other factors I haven't noticed.

All if this kind of makes me want to learn more about the geography and culture of Eastern Tibet.  It would be nice to learn about what seems to have been a veritable crucible of realized masters.

Malcolm, when I have to choose whom I trust, either you or the realized Tibetan masters from whom I have received teachings on phowa and the bardo, I choose the realized Tibetan masters. Deal with it.

The implication of your interpretation is that the most basic teachings you'll receive in every phowa course are nonsense, because they send the students on a million years detour when they could reach enlightenment in a couple of human rebirths. That's just plain nonsense. Insult me all you want. That doesn't change a thing.

Sorry guys, but all teachers from whom I have received Phowa and Bardo teachings agree that being led to a pure land is favourable to a human rebirth, including the passage by Thrangu Rinpoche I've quoted earlier:
When we are about to be reborn and enter a new existence, it is best to close the doorway to the womb and to meditate the yidam deity, to pray to Amitabha or Avalokiteshvara, so that we don’t enter the new existence but be led to a pure realm. That is ideally the best thing to accomplish. If we can’t do this, then it is said we should pray to be reborn before Padmasambhava, in the presence of Avalokiteshvara or in a good land where we will be able to practice the dharma.

This aspiration prayer also has information. According to the translation one kalpa is one day there. It is quadrillions of kalpas if you add up what is described in the text and possibly much more until you reach buddhahood, though it's not clear if that is human or Sukhavati time, and I don't know if there is different information in sutras or other texts.

In another simple explanation, there are four different lengths of kalpas. A regular kalpa is approximately 16 million years long (16,798,000 years[5]), and a small kalpa is 1000 regular kalpas, or about 16 billion years. Further, a medium kalpa is roughly 320 billion years, the equivalent of 20 small kalpas. A great kalpa is 4 medium kalpas, or around 1.28 trillion years.

And this regardless of the level of teachings attributed to them in the literature?

Malcolm wrote:
No. Every liberated person has realized the absence of self, i.e., emptiness, and in so doing, has ceased being under control of afflictions. Degrees of liberation are determined by remainder of afflictive obscuration one must eradicate.

Dzogchen is simply one path among many to accomplish this aim. As the Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra states:

If someone does not dwell in words and does not dwell in names,
that is Prajñāpāramitā,
the transcendent state of buddhahood itself;
it is obtained with wisdom
and is liberated from all affliction.

That is just not how things work in the bardo.

Spelare said:
Isn't one's experience of the bardo conditioned by culture and prior training or lack thereof?

Malcolm wrote:
First, we have to distinguish between the common bardo (antarabhāva) teaching found in Abhidharma, and so on, with the bardo presentation found exclusively in the Great Perfection Tantras of the Upadeśa class and their instructions.

Second, the question of near-death experiences will follow after that.

In all Buddhist traditions, the moment of the death (' chi kha ) is a crucial point at which through recognizing the way the one's elements and so on dissolve into luminosity, there is an opportunity for one to recognize one's own state and wake up. All Tibetan Buddhist traditions recognize that this ends when the red and white bindu separate once the inner vāyu ceases in the body. After this is the so-called bardo of dharmatā, which is not a culturally conditioned experience in any way at all.

However, when someone has practiced the Zhitro mandala in this lifetime, it is possible for them to be guided through a process of reminding them of the significance of the experience of the bardo of dharmatā through the Shitro mandala, as in the Liberation through Hearing in the Bardo.

With respect to the first bardo, the bardo of the time of death, they are given instructions, whispered into their ear, from their guru or samaya sibling which helps them recognize the experiences they are undergoing -- this must be done after the outer vāyu (breath) ceases and before the inner vāyu ceases. It is best done immediately after the outer breath ceases.

If they do not wake up then, they can be reminded of the significance of the sounds, lights, and rays they experience during the the bardo of dharmatā case in terms of the peaceful and wrathful deities. However, practitioners of thögal will not require such a reminder, since such practitioners become familiar with and cultivate dharmatā in this lifetime, and in the bardo of dharmatā, are like children climbing into their mother's lap.

If the person fails to recognize the bardo of dharmatā, then there is the section for guiding rebirth in bardo of rebirth.

The reason that we have the Liberation through Hearing in the Bardo and other similar manuals is to provide instructions on these issues.

This is all predicated on the fact that at least for the first three weeks, or 21 days, after the bardo of death has finished, the bardo being has a mental body with all complete faculties and is capable of seeing relatives, family, and so on, once they have been reminded they are dead, they can still listen to teachings, and so on while in the bardo of rebirth until the 49th day, or after the end of their seventh bardo rebirth. However, the caveat is that it is generally only during the first three rebirths in the bardo that sentient beings still have body and memories of their previous existence. After the 21st day, they begin to fall under the strong traces that impel their next rebirth, and turn their attention to appropriating a new birth.


Spelare said:
Since the overwhelming majority of accounts of the bardo are from Tibetan Buddhists (I'm guessing there are also Indian and Bön ones), is it implausible that Christian or other "outsider" accounts would diverge drastically?  Wouldn't near-death experiences throughout history be explicable as bardo experiences?

One of the things that most appealed to me about Tibetan teachings concerning death was that they could account for the afterlife experiences of non-Buddhists, including Christian (i.e. Abrahamic) heaven and hell realm experiences, Hindu lokas, etc.

Malcolm wrote:
Buddhist teachings account for the death and afterlife experience of all sentient beings, since we are all composed of the five elements and consciousness. But it does not account for the death and afterlife experiences in the terms you imagine. For example, the teaching on the bardo of dharmatā is a unique feature of Dzogchen teachings. If you have never received teachings on it, you will never recognize the bardo of dharmatā since you will not have developed the proper corresponding meditative experience in this life to recognize it— it will flash by in an instant. In other schools such as Lamdre, they have different methods attaining liberation at the time of death and in the bardo, but they do not make a distinction of the bardo of dharmatā, let alone the four or six bardos we have in the Great Perfection teachings.

Hinduism, while eternalist, nevertheless shares with Buddhadharma the concept that liberation consist of being free from afflictions (which they term samskaras) and karma. However, since their view is based in the idea of the true existence of an ultimate self, their ultimate idea of liberation is very different from that of the Buddha. They do not have a concept of the antarabhāva, or bardo. Since they have an eternalist view of a self and what belongs to a self, they never eradicate all afflictions and thus are never truly liberated; and they never achieve omniscience.

The near-death experience Hindus, Christians, Muslims, etc. is what we consider "the moment of death experience." Why? Very simply put, the so-called near-death experiences of people are experiences where consciousness has not in fact left the body since the indestructible bindu in the heart center of the body has not separated into its white and red elements. That does not happen with the cessation of the outer vāyu (breath). That only happens with the cessation of the inner vāyu, and that generally requires three days.

What follows is a reasonably accurate presentation of the now standardized model of Hindu afterlife ideas:

Spelare said:
According to the Hinduism, upon death, a soul or Self proceeds along one of the three paths suggested in the Vedas. As death nears and a person begins to lose consciousness, the Self gathers up the breaths (pranas) and the deities (devatas) hidden in the organs of the body, and enters into the heart (hridayam). From there, through an opening in the heart, it travels upwards along the channel of up breath (udana) and reaches the head.
There through an aperture in the top head, it escapes into the air or the mid-region called antrariksham (interstellar space). Breaths and the deities who accompany the Self return to their spheres in the macrocosm. As the body is cremated in the final sacrifice of life (antima kriya), the elements in the body (bhutas) return to the elements in the world.

From here on karma (net result of past actions) catches up. Liberated souls, or those who have burned their karmas and latent impressions, travel along a path called the northern path (uttarayana) and enter into a timeless eternal zone in the sphere of the sun. From there they are led by divine beings to the highest, immortal heaven of Brahman, known variously as Vaikuntha, Parandhama or Kailasa.

Those who are not liberated, but lived virtuous and dutiful lives according to the laws of God, go by another path called the southern path (daksinayana) to the ancestral world located in the sphere of the moon, where they stay until their karmas are exhausted.
Then they fall down to the earth through rains and enter into plants, from plants into food, either as plant food or animal food, and through food into semen and then through semen into the wombs where they are reborn again according to their previous actions.

Now there is a third path, the path to the hell in the subterranean worlds (adhogati) reserved for those who indulge in serious sins and demonic actions. Upon exhausting their karmas they are born as worms, insects and other low life forms.

Malcolm wrote:
http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/death.asp

On thing to keep in mind here, Hindus want to cremate the body within 24 hours of death. Buddhists consider this terrible, since according to Buddhadharma, it takes three days for the consciousness of a person to vacate their body. From our point of view, Hindus do not account for the inner breath upon the cessation of the outer breath. For them, once one stops breathing, one is dead. Their concept of rebirth too, while interesting, bears no relationship with the idea of rebirth or punarbhāva found in the Buddha's teachings, and certainly there is nothing like the antarabhāva, or period between lives.


Spelare said:
Such experiences could be integrated into a teaching that placed liberation as a preferable outcome.  In fact, I think I've heard lamas acknowledge the possibility.

Malcolm wrote:
As Āryadeva puts it, realization depends on view. Further, liberation depends on realization. Thus, if one's view is wrong, one realization will be faulty, and if one's realization is faulty, liberation is not a possibility in this life, the bardo, or the next, unless or until one meets the Dharma and discovers the right view by depending on a virtuous mentor.

Such lamas and teachers, are either naive, or in the attempt to be kind to those who come to Buddhadharma with strong clinging to their past religious upbringing, can actually do a disservice to their students by making such statements. The experience of the dissolution of the body that sentient beings have during the death process are generic, and the hallucinations that people have during this process are irrelevant to the process itself.  See 226-234 of Gyurme Dorje's translation, The Tibetan Book of the Dead: the First Complete Translation.

For example, on page 233, for those people without a yidam, it says "Meditate on the Lord of Great Compassion," which any Tibetan will readily know how to do.  But since Jesus, Mary, Krishna, Shiva, etc. are not buddhas, and are not connected to a Buddhist path through being defined as an excellent yidam, there is no ultimate benefit in telling people to focus on these religious figures during their death process, apart from giving them comfort. Giving a dying person comfort is a desiderata of course, but in this it is merely a palliative, and will at best lead them to rebirth again in the three higher realms. This is not a bad thing, but let us not kid ourselves into thinking such an experience "could be integrated into a teaching that placed liberation as a preferable outcome."

Even telling them to focus on an activity deity such as Jambhala is of no benefit, since these activity deities are not complete paths. Only bodhisattvas like Mañujuśrī, Avalokiteśvara, Tāra, and so on will function in this way for ordinary people who have no regular yidam practice.

Good thing I haven't been speaking of liberation then, isn't it? Seriously, Malcolm, I've been intentionally avoiding this term the entire time.

Except that if Jesus was an enlightened being then praying to him in the bardo will have exactly the same effect as praying to any other enlightened being in the bardo.

And later:
Also, you will have no problem to believe that he'll be able to transfer you into a pure land when you pray to him in the bardo. Sorry, Malcolm, I really don't see what sense it makes to start some discussion about the question if this is called liberation or not. If one reaches liberation immediately in the bardo or later in the pure land really makes no difference here.
The reasons why I have avoided the word "liberation" is 1. because Jesus himself didn't speak of Liberation, he spoke of Salvation, and 2. if you're being led to a pure land by an enlightened being then that's where the actual liberation will take place some time later, the mere act of being led into the pure land is not yet liberation itself, but it will lead to your liberation. And I'm sure that I've heard lots of Buddhist teachings about the bardo where praying to an enlightened being in the bardo is referred to as a chance for liberation. So actually the Tibetan tradition isn't as nitpicky as you.

You, on the other hand just very clearly rejected the idea of being saved by another being as contradicting the Dharma. But if somebody leads you to a place where you will for sure reach enlightenment that pretty much counts as that being "saving you".

This is much better than the endless millions of years one needs to spend in Amitabha's buddhafield in order to attain full buddhahood.

cyril said:
I guess that depends on your definition of the worst Dzogchen practitioner. Apparently, receiving Dzogchen teachings and praticing them to the best of your abilities does not necessarily make you a Dzogchen practitioner albeit ofthe worst kind.

A couple of days before we left, Khenpo arranged for his brother, Kyali Loli, to have an interview with the Chatralwa. Loli was neither a scholar nor an accomplished meditator. Anyhow, he had already received Dzogpa Chenpo teachings and had practiced them after completion of his common practices and preliminaries. But when he met Chatralwa it was disappointing for him. It is not because he wasn't doing well with his Dzogpa Chenpo meditation, but that he wasn't even ready to start it.

On that day, one of the most important days of his life, Kyali Loli went to see Chatralwa. Loli was a very courageous person and nothing would intimidate him. So Loli explained his practice, especially concerning his Dzogpa Chenpo experiences, and he requested instructions and clarifications. Chatralwa, without making any remarks about Loli's presentation, said:
"You should first try to say with devotion the "name prayer" of Amitabha Buddha I00 times a day, then increase it to 200, and so on. One day there might be a time when whatever you are doing, you will always be united with the expression of the ''name'' of the Buddha and the feeling of the presence of the Buddha. If that happens, when you die, you will die with the expression and feelings of the Buddha Mind presence of the Buddha. Then, because of your merits and the blessings of the Buddha, perceptions will manifest as the Buddha-field, and your future will be in peace and happiness. Then you will be equipped to serve others".

Then he wrote down a few lines, a quotation from a sutra which reveals the merits and benefits of the ''recitation of the name of Amitabha Buddha.'' Kyali Loli was disappointed because he didn't get any Dzogpa Chenpo teachings, and it broke his proud heart. But, now thinking back, I can understand how these teachings were perfect for him, and how it will be beneficial if he or anybody uses those instructions. It is important for the teacher to be fair, frank, certain, and clear, and for the disciple to be realistic, careful, tolorant, and open, as a line says:
''Having the Dzogpa Chenpo as teachings is not enough, The person needs to become Dzogpa Chenpo.''

When an interested student does not understand the teachings of Dzogchen, this is the fault of the teacher.

How do we determine that this is the definitive meaning, and not a provisional teaching for a particular time, place, and retinue?  Who can determine that?

I suspect that there are buddhas other than the ones we've all heard of, who have taught beings far from the limits of the South and East Asian cultural spheres.  Perhaps the notion of lands to which a buddha has not appeared is mere parochialism codified by scholastics according to the limits of their knowledge.

Assuming the realization of emptiness to be a sine qua non:

If there are Mahāyāna practitioners who formally assent to emptiness without ever realizing it expetientially, could there not also be others who realize emptiness experientially without ever formally assenting to it?  In that case, there could be Theravadins, for example, who did in fact realize emptiness fully rather than partially, but who never adopted or defended it publicly.  Why could there not then be Buddhists (or bodhisattvas or buddhas) in all but name who realized emptiness to some degree or fully, without the need for formal instruction?

Malcolm wrote:
Emptiness realized by śrāvaka arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and buddhas is the same emptiness. The difference between buddhas and the former two is omniscience about paths, not liberation. In terms of liberation, all three are equal.

It's polemic because Christians have forms of mind training, too. They have prayers, meditations, contemplations, confessions and whatnot. Of course there are differences to Buddhist mind training, they don't have the same meditation techniques as we do, but they do have forms of mind training. Of course not everybody practices as they're supposed to, but that's just normal and can be said about Buddhists, too. I mean, just look at us, we're wasting our time discussing on the internet instead of sitting on the cushion. The least thing a practicing Christian is required to do is repeat certain standard prayers throughout the day. If somebody does that for years he will have established a habit of praying that will help him in the bardo - if Jesus is an enlightened being. Of course, you don't agree with that precondition, I get that.

Well, Deshung Rinpoche used to offer regular tormas to the Liberty Statue, a small representation of which he carried about with him everywhere.

As mentioned above, the idea that bodhisattvas manifest as teachers to nonbuddhists is not novel. Even the Buddha, the Pali Canon reports, would manifest as a brahmin and teach brahmins and so on. But he was not teaching them Buddhadharma. For example, in the Medicine Tantra, it is reported that when the Medicine Buddha manifested the the teacher Vidyajñāna, he manifested four Vidyajñānas, who were each perceived by the four retinue— devas, rishis, tīrthikas, and buddhists— to be teaching the medical texts of their own traditions.

Even supposing Jesus and his mom were emanations of Avalokiteśvara and Tārā, respectively, this does not mean that they were able to teach a liberative path in those forms. What it does mean is that that beings who were to be tamed by such forms, would be tamed by Avalokiteśvara and Tārā manifesting in those forms to teach them. Avalokiteśvara manifests in the form of a buddha to teach those to be tamed by a buddha, manifests in the form of a pratyekabuddha to teach those to be tamed by a pratyekabuddha, manifests in the form of an arhat to teach those to be tamed by an arhat, or even manifests in the form of a piścaci to teach those to be tamed in the form of a piśaci.

One's ability to meet the Dharma, the only source of liberation on this globe, depends on attaining the eight freedoms and ten endowments of a precious human birth. As Dzogchen practitioners, this should be axiomatically understood. Just in case anyone has forgotten what these are:

The way it works is rather that the powers that be use whatever ideology, religion or philosophy the populace believes in and twist and turn it so they can abuse it for their own needs. Just look at the ideas of Marx and what that has been turned into in history. The fact that Marx was atheist was no protection against that.

I mean, isn't that a little bit at odds with the spirit of Mahāyāna?  Obviously, we're not going to talk about advanced teachings we're not authorized to share with someone who wouldn't benefit from them anyway.  But things like śamatha, for example, can benefit everybody, even non-Buddhists.  Lamas like Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche and Alan Wallace have said it would be lacking in compassion not to share general teachings that can help alleviate suffering, relatively if not ultimately.  We are enjoined to rejoice even in the samsaric happiness of sentient beings.
Are other traditions profound? How so? How do they lead to something other than higher birth in samsara?
Even if you don't believe another tradition leads to anything beyond favorable rebirth, you're not going to get anywhere when engaging with a knowledgeable adherent of that tradition if you are willfully ignorant of it.  They will notice when you misconstrue it and rely on strawman caricatures of non-Buddhist teachings, brought out only to be summarily dismissed without serious investigation.  If you have actually studied different systems with sincerity and are still convinced that only Buddhist vehicles are valid, and that of those Atiyoga is the undisputed pinnacle, then they will respect your judgment more than if you come across as a narrow sectarian.
The only thing similar between Buddhadharma and other traditions is that we all emphasize compassion; but even here, the compassion of other traditions is limited in its scope.
I think the cultivation of attention, along the lines of śamatha, has parallels in the Hindu, Christian, and Sufi traditions; perhaps in others.  Nowadays it is taught even in secular contexts.  Not that these approaches are in every respect identical, but that ethically neutral meditative practice is fairly universal in the major world tradtions.  Someone who has cultivated their attention well, even if in a non-Buddhist context, might be better prepared to receive the View.  That compassion you mentioned couldn't hurt either, even if it isn't Great Compassion.

Pretty remarkable for a medieval German, though, isn't it?

But Eckhart went further in deconstructing the very idea of God.  He talked about something called "the essence of God":

Eckhart, Sermon 87 said:
While I yet stood in my first cause, I had no God and was my own cause: then I wanted nothing and desired nothing, for I was bare being and the knower of myself in the enjoyment of truth.  Then I wanted myself and wanted no other thing: what I wanted I was and what I was I wanted, and thus I was free of God and all things.  But when I left my free will behind and received my created being, then I had a God. For before there were creatures, God was not 'God': He was That which He was.  But when creatures came into existence and received their created being, then God was not 'God' in Himself—He was 'God' in creatures.

Therefore I pray to God to make me free of God, for my essential being is above God, taking God as the origin of creatures.  For in that essence of God in which God is above being and distinction, there I was myself and knew myself so as to make this man. Therefore I am my own cause according to my essence, which is eternal, and not according to my becoming, which is temporal.  Therefore I am unborn, and according to my unborn mode I can never die.  According to my unborn mode I have eternally been, am now, and shall eternally remain.  That which I am by virtue of birth must die and perish, for it is mortal, and so must perish with time.  In my birth all things were born, and I was the cause of myself and all things: and if I had so willed it, I would not have been, and all things would not have been.  If I were not, God would not be either. I am the cause of God's being God: if I were not, then God would not be God. But you do not need to know this.

But if the "I" speaking there is the same "I" that in our own tradition's scriptures says "I am primordial self-originating wisdom.  I am the primordial source of all phenomena.  I am the all-creating king, pure perfect presence," what he has said is the opposite of arrogance or presumption.

The story of an "I" reposing in its first cause and then giving rise to creation sounds very much like the accounts we've heard of dualistic samsaric experience arising through non-recognition and the arising of false knowledge on the basis of ignorance.  In fact, I would suggest that that is what Eckhart is trying to get at.  But he phrases it in the language of "creation" that was known to everyone in his culture the same way that Buddhist accounts of how dualistic consciousness arises would be familiar to Buddhists.  Eckhart saw the need to go back to the ground from which all conceptual proliferation arises.

Does he have to have fully realized and integrated that awakening in order for us to suspect he had a genuine glimpse?  Of course we won't find Buddhist words coming out of his mouth, because he was unacquainted with Buddhism.  However, if we take seriously the teaching that all sentient beings have buddha-nature . . . very possible.
