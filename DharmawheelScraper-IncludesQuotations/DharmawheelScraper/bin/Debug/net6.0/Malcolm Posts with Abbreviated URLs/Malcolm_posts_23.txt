To be honest, I actually think no Zen practitioner really cares much if Zen is called sutric or not, or how other traditions categorize its approach. Why should they?

Malcolm wrote:
They shouldn't.

Meido said:
Zen is clear as to its own relationship with the sutras as well as its method. For example:
If you study the sutra teachings, you easily get stuck in the traces of the teachings. How then can you slough off your old body? ... Our patriarchal Zen school does not depend on the traces of the teachings [the sutras], but has a special meaning: energy, free and unobstructed, responding in accord with the situation, that is what it is about. ... Nowadays there is much talk about the sublime and the profound, or conversely criticism of the Two Vehicles, belittling their authority. [Students of] the partial, the round, the exoteric and the exoteric schools contend with each other, yet they have not even accomplished the confirmation of the Two Vehicles, let alone that of the Bodhisattva Vehicle. And as for the One Buddha Vehicle, how could they conceive of it even in their dreams? What use to them then are the partial, round, exoteric, and esoteric [teachings]? ... None of this applies to our patriarchal school, which surpasses expedient means. When by bitter interviews and painful training at last the principle is attained, the then Buddhadharma of the exoteric and esoteric schools appears directly before the eyes.
[Torei, Shumon Mujintoron]

Malcolm wrote:
These considerations are not disputed.

Meido said:
Regarding actual method,

"energy, free and unobstructed, responding in accord with the situation" refers to the direct pointing activity of the teacher, which encompasses not only various transmitted methods for this purpose but also (in fact, mainly) the general effect on the student's conditions of the teachers ba [proximity, field], the function of which is described in terms of, and dependent upon, kiai [energetic quality and intensity] and joriki [samadhi power]. Related to this are various physical manifestations of realization described in oral instruction that mark a qualified teacher, and which impact the ability of the student to catch certain things. If we are discussing post-kensho practice, these things remain important since the teacher must be able to manifest an embodied fruition of various practices that the student takes up.

Malcolm wrote:
I have no reason to doubt that these things are important in the Rinzai Zen tradition.

Meido said:
"bitter interviews" refers to the core method of Zen, i.e. sanzen [face to face encounter with the teacher].
"painful training" refers to the post-kensho path. Hakuin and Torei unpack this pretty clearly with reference to Tozan's 5 ranks, with explanation of what realization of the 4 wisdoms/3 bodies within this body and life means in Zen practice, describing the practice after recognition of one's nature for which the secret 3-year [minimum] practices of hokkyo zanmai and hen sho ego zanmai are the main points, etc.

Malcolm wrote:
In other words, Chan/Zen is causal path.

Meido said:
But you can't practice only from those writings: they are meant to be taken up in the sanzen room with one's teacher, who can manifest the fruition-states of the practices.

Malcolm wrote:
Sure.

Meido said:
Of course many other methods supporting all this exist. In Rinzai practice the core thing is tanden soku, i.e. the method of sealing the breath power in the lower abdomen through a physical usage of the anal sphincter, pelvic floor, and diaphragm, retaining that for longer and longer periods until it becomes constant and subtle. There are various reasons for this, and Hakuin writes about it quite a bit (though again, without giving complete practice details).

Malcolm wrote:
In Vajrayāna, this is called 'jam rlung (gentle breath), and it means maintaining this "seal" as you put it, constantly. There are more forceful methods, but this is considered to be essential for all practice in all traditions. These kinds of prāṇayāma practices are written about extensively in Vajrayāna. They are of consummate importance.

Hakuin lived in late 17th century and early 18th century. I would not be surprised at all if Indian methods of prāṇāyāma had spread widely in Chinese and Japanese monasteries by this time, either from Tibetan sources or even Shingon (which is ), or even Taoist sources, since Japanese medicine is largely Taoist in nature.

Meido said:
See how that all needed to be unpacked? I mean, if someone is really interested in method, I can talk a lot about it. But most of the details regarding what one actually does in genuine Zen practice remain solely in the realm of kuden (oral instruction). Zen is just not a tradition that is big on explicit written practice instruction.

Malcolm wrote:
This is also the case with Vajrayāna—but these things were written down because people forget them.

Meido said:
It is ironic, but at this point I think it is easier for anyone to research details of, for example, various HYT practices than it is to find accurate information RE what actually passes between teacher and student in a sanzen room.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, but of course you will readily understand that without oral explanation the written instructions are incomplete. The written instructions are for reference.

Meido said:
FWIW sutras were never much used as a reference in my experience except for just a few passages that, along with many Zen writings, were accompanied by additional verbal explanation (in sanzen, during teisho) explaining some specific practice application. For example, a passage from the Vimalakirti sutra pointing out a use of the body that has utility.

Malcolm wrote:
Sure, this is understandable. The Tibetan description of sūtra vs. tantra, sudden/gradual has less to do with the textual traditions than it does method of entry.

Meido said:
So at the end of the day, is it all sutric or not? No problem to me to say so. It's not tantric, so call it sutric, or non-tantric upadesha, or whatever one likes that best fit the categories that one accepts. But the only important point to me is the oral instructions from one's teacher in whom one has great faith, which clarify the Zen writings and transmit practice details. It's hard to talk much about Zen in any useful manner without having those (though certainly common enough - even among some Zen folks).

Malcolm wrote:
I agree, which is why I rarely discuss Chan or Zen.

But when people make statements wondering what all the fuss is about, it is useful to consider the perspectives of Tibetans, like Nubchen, who trained in Tang-era Chan as well as Vajrayāna during the late 8th and the 9th century, both in Tibet, as well as the fertile and ecumenical environment of Dunhuang. While the Chan they encountered is certainly not the same as the Post-Song era school of Rinzai to which you belong, they are related and so their accounts are of interest to those who wish to understand the overall differences, claims. and counterclaims, made  by its various adherents.

Anyway, thanks for your input, always valued.

Do you mean that there are no empowerments in sutra? Still, since the nature of mind is directly perceived in the sutrayana, the goal of the empowerments is achieved there too, so, as you noted before, it is the method that is different.

Malcolm wrote:
No one ever disputed the goal of all the Buddha's teachings was to perceive the nature of the mind, and this realizing this was bodhi.

What I am claiming is that there is no direct introduction in sūtra. In sūtra, the nature of the mind, to use your term, is the result of the path, whether gradual or not, not the basis. In sūtra, one does not start at the nature of the mind because it is never directly introduced and no methods are provided for such an introduction. In Vajrayāna, the gnosis pointed out in the beginning is the basis for the path, whether that path again is gradual, as in the case of the eight lower yānas; or nongradual, as in Atiyoga (though to be fair, in Atiyoga it is explained that buddhahood through

Astus said:
But if we talk of Chan, the very meaning of sudden awakening is not going through stages using various skilful means to eventually attain realisation, but obtaining it directly.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct. This is acknowledged. But as above, you are describing this in terms of a result to obtain through a cause. A result is a result, whether obtained gradually or suddenly, and it is obtained from a cause, whether gradually or suddenly, whether through a process of gathering the two accumulations over eons or a sudden flash of intuition. Then of course, even if one has this sudden flash of intuition, without the guidance of teacher one will not be able to ascertain whether this gradual attainment or sudden intuition is the real deal. In this respect, there is no difference between Vajrayāna in general and Chan. Both systems depend on a teacher. The principle difference is that in the case of the former, the interested student is first introduced to their own state by the teacher; in the case of the latter, the teacher confirms for the student they indeed have had a proper intuition of the nature of the mind.

I am not sure how much time Astus has spent with Zen teachers. My understanding is that he is essentially a scholar and a sole practitioner, so not really representative of Zen. Neither am I, btw.

In order to get a balanced view on this subject, one needs either a Zen teacher or a competent student. Failing that, people can search for old posts by such.

As it stands it seems to be a no contest. One that's been played before.

This is why Nubchen assigns Chan to a position inferior to Mahāyoga, while at the same time, elevating it above the gradualist approach of Kamalashila, and extensively cites Bodhidharma and more than 40 Tang Chan masters, to show how it is that Chan is superior to the gradualist approach of Kamalashila.

We also know that concurrently in India, there was a sutric sudden awakening approach that owed nothing to Chan, memorialized in a text by Vimalamitra called The Meaning of Nonconceptual Meditation, the Sudden Approach ( cig car 'jug pa rnam par mi rtog pa'i bsgom don ). Unsurprisingly, the first text is cited in defense of this is the Lanka Sūtra.

This is important, because the six causes and four conditions are treated in Mahāyāna sūtra and tantras, as well as in such diverse literatures as Tibetan Medicine and even explanations of delusion of sentient beings in Dzogchen teachings.

So, as I said, I never found Pali Abhidhamma tradition of any use in understanding Mahāyāna texts, despite its obvious value as a important intellectual tradition in Buddhism as a whole.

Tsongkhapa disagrees.

Some say, “Mantra was propounded for the sake of taming desirous trainees, and the Perfection Vehicle for the sake of training trainees free from desire; therefore, meditative cultivation of a path without abandoning desire or of a path that abandons desire is the reason dividing the Great Vehicle into two vehicles.” 

About this let me explain: If the Great Vehicle were divided into two vehicles because among the trainees of these two vehicles there are those who cultivate the path without having abandoned desire and those who cultivate a path abandoning desire, then since both vehicles have both, this feature cannot distinguish the vehicles:

• because there are many householder Bodhisattvas who have entered the path of the Perfection Vehicle but have not abandoned impure deeds, and there are also many skilled in method who out of great altruism act impurely, as in the case of the Brahmin Khyiu Karma (khyi’u skar ma / khye’u skar ma)

• and because among the trainees of the Mantra Vehicle there also are many who have abandoned attachment to the attributes of the desire realm; otherwise, there would be the fault that one could not be freed from the desires of the desire realm until Buddhahood, or the fault that, having attained Buddhahood, one would still not have abandoned the desires of the desire realm.

Not necessarily. The Trikaya teaching emerged after the composition of the main body of Mahayana sutras. We might say that trikaya teaching was distilled from the sutras, in the way that abhidharma is distilled from the sutras. Identifying dharma and sambhoga kayas and identifying them with different names, however derived (purposefully, mistakenly) is reasonable. The fact that they are directly associated makes sense.

Malcolm wrote:
In Indian literature, the Trikāya doctrine emerges out of the sūtras associated with the Yogacāra school. The doctrine seems to have been formalized by Maitreyanātha and Asanga.

In pre-Yogacāra Buddhism, there were only two kāyas: dharmakāya and rūpakāya.

In pre-Madhyamaka/PP Buddhism, there was only one kāya mentioned, dharmakāya, that referred to collected words of the Buddha.

The reason there is so much confusion about the three kāyas is that most Buddhists have a revelatory view of the sūtras, assuming eternal doxologies.

But if you study the sūtras layer by later, looking for terms in texts, checking the dates of translations in the Chinese Canon, and so on, you can arrive a pretty accurate picture of the sedimentary layers of Classical Indian Mahāyāna, which then went on to inspire Buddhists in Central Asian, China, and so on.

It's not correct to define the magical rituals in the tantras as folk magic. It's the opposite. Folk magic would be things Tibetans or Indians pass on orally in their homes and villages, outside of the purview of orthodox Tibetan Buddhist and Hindu religious institutions. The action rituals of the Buddhist tantras are supposed to be used for the benefit of all sentient beings, folk magic is not.

Tantra is not my vehicle, and I think that's fine as long as I respect Tantra, and I actually do respect Tantra. Tantra makes some very extreme, and IMO likely hyperbolic, claims about itself and its liberative techniques, and Tantrikas have a lot of faith in their teachers. I've never met a teacher, Tantrika or not, that inspired such conviction in me. Perhaps this is discernment in me or perhaps this is excess of skepticism. The latter is very likely. The problem is, when I imagine myself believing similar things, having similar convictions regarding specific points of tantric methods, I can only imagine myself engaged in vainglory, and this is because of the grand and very profound claims of Tantra. Fusing the path with the result is a very audacious claim, regardless of if it is true or not that such a thing can even be done.

Sorry, Ayu, this is one of those situations where its on you to explain this. My opinion only matters to me so long as it makes sense to me. I've defined, in a way that I think is pretty clear, what I mean. If you're attached to the phrasing that your school promulgates, despite it meaning something else, well... the devil is in the details.

Telling a newbie, "Meditate on emptiness", when you're actually talking about "meditating without an object", then I'm the one who's bad for pointing out the apparent inconsistency between these phrases?

Malcolm wrote:
In the Gelug school, meditation on emptiness is an analytical meditation which begins by searching for the inherent existence of a given thing. It is part of the vipaśyanā phase of their system. When this absence of inherent existence, aka emptiness, is discovered conceptually, the practitioner is supposed to cultivate this emptiness conceptually. One of the famed sequences of this sort of analytical meditation, as it is termed in Gelug, is the seven-fold deconstruction of a cart.

The Gelugpas make a very big deal over what Tsongkhapa termed, "identifying the object of negation." This involved identifying both a subtle as well as a coarse object of negation. The object of negation Tsongkhapa favored is the so-called subtle object of negation, inherent existence. The other object of negation is called the coarse objection of negation, existence, and so on, the so-called four extremes. Tsongkhapa does not like this approach, because he feels it involves an over-negation, and can harm conventional truth, and so on.

So when Gelugpas say they are meditating on emptiness, what they mean is that they are meditating on "the nonexistence of the true existence, which is the emptiness of inherent existence." This is also what it means for Gelugpas to say that it is proper to meditate on emptiness as a conceptual object, because they hold that this conceptualized emptiness, the absence of inherent existence, is functional simulacrum of the emptiness which is realized in an ārya's equipoise and leads to that realization when properly meditated upon.

Title: Black in America by David Gamble Jr.
Content:
Unknown said:
I grew up in Reno, Nevada.

In third grade a boy confidently tells me and my brother that his mom said black people cannot swim because our muscles are different than those of white people.

In middle school, standing among a group of white classmates talking video games, I am the only black child. One classmate expresses surprise that my family has enough money to afford a PlayStation.

In high school, I am the only black kid among a group of friends. When sharing drinks in my presence they frequently tell each other not to “niggerlip” the bottles. Even though I object, they continue to use the phrase.

In high school, my brother is at a teen house party that gets broken up by police, a common occurrence. The kids at the party scatter, also a common occurrence. My brother, the only black child in attendance, is the only one on whom a police officer draws a firearm to get him to stop running away. He is 14.

In high school, a group of my white friends frequently sneak on to the outdoor basketball courts at an athletic club to play. They can usually play for hours, including with club members. On the two occasions I attend, club members complain and we are ejected from the club within minutes.

In high school, I am excited about black history month and am talking to a friend about black inventors. My friend snorts and says, “Black people have never invented anything.”

In high school, as graduation approaches, many of my white friends tell me that I am lucky. They tell me that due to my skin color, I will get into any college I want.

I remain in Reno for college.

During college an employer keeps food for employees in the break room refrigerator. One morning I decided to have microwaveable chicken wings for breakfast. The employer tells me I might not want to eat that for breakfast with my skin color. The employer immediately apologizes.

In college I am standing in a group of white friends on campus. A white acquaintance of one of my friends approaches to chat. The acquaintance tells a story about something that frustrated him and then reels off a series of expletives ending with the word, “nigger.” None of my friends corrects him.

In college I visit an antique shop in Auburn, California with my girlfriend, who is white, and her parents. The shopkeeper follows me around the store whistling loudly as I browse, until we leave.

I move to San Diego, California for law school.

In law school, during a discussion in my criminal law class, a white classmate suggests that police officers should take a suspect’s race into account when determining whether there is reasonable suspicion to believe that an individual is committing a crime.

The weekend of my law school graduation my family comes to San Diego. I go to the mall with my brother and sister and visit the Burberry store. Two different employees follow us around the store – never speaking to us – until we leave.

After law school, I return to Reno.

A co-worker jokingly calls me “King David” upon seeing me each day. I joke that I’m not treated like a king. The co-worker then begins to call me “Slave David” each time we encounter one another. When I ask the co-worker to stop because it is hurtful, I am told by my co-worker that this is a problem that I have in my head.

I attend a pub crawl with friends. We end up at a party in a hotel suite in downtown Reno. I am greeted by a white man at the door who loudly expresses surprise that I am an “educated negro” upon hearing me speak.

I walk a friend who is a white woman from a restaurant to her car because it is night time. As we stand by the car chatting, a police officer pulls up and shines a light on us, asking if everything is okay. Once my friend confirms, the officer drives away. I tell her that he was worried about her, she teasingly says, “Oh yeah, because you’re so scary.” Later, I tell another white friend I felt racially profiled by the officer. My friend shrugs and says, “I don’t know man, that’s a stretch.”

A white friend tells me that white voters have become upset at black people because of black people’s liberal use of food welfare benefits. When I point out that more whites than blacks receive welfare benefits in the U.S., my friend expresses confusion at how that could be the case.

I leave a downtown restaurant with my wife. As we walk along the river a homeless man appears to be having a schizophrenic episode, engaging auditory hallucinations. Upon seeing me, he becomes lucid and begins to shout the word “nigger” over and over.

I discover that one of my clients does not want me to represent him as his Public Defender because he does not want a black attorney. I am given the option to withdraw as counsel. I do not.

Last year, I am at a barbecue chatting with a white acquaintance who asks if I have ever experienced racism. When I say it is a nearly daily occurrence, the acquaintance retorts, without missing a beat, “Bullshit.”

Two months ago. I am driving to lunch with the black teen I mentor. At a red light a white woman crosses the street. As I begin to drive, she turns around and screams at us, “F**k you f****ing nigger!”

Before any of these instances, my family of origin moved to Reno, Nevada from Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania in 1984.

My mother recently told me that when I was a very young child my parents hired a company to remove a tree from our front lawn. Two white men showed up and removed the tree. One of them carved a swastika into the stump. My father had to confront him and ask him to remove it.

Before that, my now 93 -year-old grandfather served in the Army National Guard and was stationed in the U.S. south. Despite being active duty, he was not allowed to eat in restaurants due to “whites only” signage. He had to wait for fellow Guardsmen to bring him food outside.

Not long before that, my family were slaves, owned by Americans of English and Irish descent, which is why – despite being primarily of African descent – I have an English last name.

This is my experience of being black in America. To be black in America is to be told over and over that you are not good enough, that you do not belong, that you are genetically unfit, that your physical presence is undesirable, and that everything about you – right down to your lips – is wrong. It is absolutely true that everyone experiences hardships in life, but the psychological weight of being told both explicitly and implicitly, on a daily basis, that your very existence is objectionable can at times feel unbearable.

And despite this experience, I still love my country, my state, and my city. Despite my experience, I would not choose to be anything other than a black American. The history of black people in this country is one of struggle and triumph. Our people were brought to this country as slaves and against all odds, in the face of seemingly insurmountable obstacles, have made our mark. Through slavery, poll taxes, literacy tests, redlining, and black codes we have persevered. Through the unspeakable horrors of mass lynchings; the Tuskegee syphilis experiments; and the massacres at Tulsa and Rosewood, we have persevered.

Bass Reeves, Dovey Johnson Roundtree, Sarah Boone, Oscar Micheaux, Shirley Chisholm, Dorie Miller, Susie King Taylor, Georgia Gilmore, Octavius Catto, Jack Johnson, Garrett Morgan, James W.C. Pennington. These are just a handful of extraordinary and oft forgotten black Americans who helped to mold and preserve the American Dream. These individuals and their accomplishments should not be regarded as “black history,” but rather as American history.

I am an American of privilege, which makes me an African American of great privilege. I am an attorney. I live in a safe neighborhood. My children do not worry about their next meal. I can afford child care. My family can afford personal vehicles. If my children become sick, I can take them to the doctor. If I am this privileged, and these have been my experiences, primarily in my own hometown, often with friends and acquaintances who are fond of me, and of whom I remain fond even now; just imagine what daily life must be like for a black person in this country who does not enjoy my level of privilege.

The protests in the streets of America are certainly about the killing of George Floyd, but not just about George Floyd. They are about countless black men, women, and children for whom the punishment did not fit the crime – if indeed there was a crime at all. We live in a country where, in order to recall what life under Jim Crow felt like, many white Americans must pick up a history book. Meanwhile, many black Americans need only pick up a telephone, and call their parents.

When we as people of color share our experiences, we are not doing so to score political points, “play the race card,” get sympathy, assign blame, or to make you feel bad about yourself. We are asking you for help. We are asking you to join us in the ongoing fight against racism in our country, because we cannot do it alone. It will take Americans of every stripe to eradicate racism from American society.

I am now asking for your help. Please seek truth and knowledge. When sharing information, please check your sources and make sure that they are reliable. Try to place what is happening today into a historical context. Read about systemic racism and anti-racism. When your friends of color tell you that racism is real and affecting their lives, believe them and then, if you can, do something about it.

My children are likely to attend the same middle school and high school that I did. It is my great hope for them that those around them have the knowledge, compassion, and guidance to know better than to daily deluge them with words that make them doubt their intelligence, their beauty, and their worth as human beings based only on the color of their skin; and instead judge them by the content of their character.

It is for all of the above reasons, and so many more that we proudly say #blacklivesmatter

As I pointed out, Āmrapālī was one of the Buddha's direct disciples, and he gave several teachings at her place while she was still working as a courtesan.

And, it is held in the Candamahārośana Tantra that the farm girl who restored the Buddha to health with rice milk was in fact his consort.

And in general, in Vajrayāna, sexual activity is taken into the path, not renounced or avoided. So yes, even porn stars can be good Buddhists if they choose.

Porn is like booze: every one watches it, everyone enjoys it in some form or another, and everyone complains it is "bad."

I wouldn't frame it: “sex/masturbation” though. Two totally  different ballgames (pun not originally intended, but I’ll roll with it).

Many things that the NoFap movement says about porn and how it divorces the mind & body from reality, are true. Not to put any sanctimonious moral judgement on it, it’s just that it seems that the science shows how pmo (porn masturbation orgasm) has little to no benefit.

For example, from what I’ve read studies have shown that masturbation does not increase testosterone, whereas actual sex does increase testosterone in men.

One last question about a group of prayers called "Le'u Dünma" along with The General Visualization for Prayers to Guru Rinpoche by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo. Is this group of prayers with its visualization as a whole permitted for anyone to use or is there an empowerment needed? I'm more interested in the general visualization as it seems most prayers are ok as previously stated. i wasn't as clear in my last post about them so i wanted to link them here.

Generally, if you can get the lung, it is better, but these are standard prayers and you don't necessarily need a lung. The Seven Chapter prayer does not have an empowerment per se, but there is a section of it that does, the Sampa Lhundrupma, nevertheless, to recite this one does not need to the lung, necessarily. But if you can get the lung, it is a little better.

However, for the JKW practice appended to this, you would need the lung for that. But it is easy to get.

Manjushri said:
A system in which public policies, institutional practices, cultural representations, and other norms work in various, often reinforcing ways to perpetuate racial group inequity. It identifies dimensions of our history and culture that have allowed privileges associated with “whiteness” and disadvantages associated with “color” to endure and adapt over time. Structural racism is not something that a few people or institutions choose to practice. Instead it has been a feature of the social, economic and political systems in which we all exist.

Brexit, for example, is predicated on the structural or systemic racism which permeates UK culture.

One does not have to be racist to be a participant in systemic racism, one merely has to be a beneficiary of it. Western Europe and America are structurally racist due to the very workings of colonialism, capitalism, and imperialism, and all the benefits we as white people have gained from this historical set of circumstances.

It has a forward faceing visualization of Guru Rinpoche, and im not sure if i would be permitted to practice it without instruction. I'm really just trying to find were the cut off line is as i dont want to practice or pray anything frivolously without knowing if there are any empowerments needed, commitments or vows that are expected to be followed.

With me not haveing a really firm foundation in Tibetan Buddhism or a guru i would rather be studious about these things without throwing caution to the wind, and merely practiceing whaever sparks my fancy. I remember reading your posts regarding initiations that engaging in certain practises without empowerment will only burn through merit being worst than useless because of not being properly brought into the mandala of a practice with its empowerments.

Personally, to make fun of one person while suffering is a bit unseemly. One may argue she might be deluded or childish in regards to her groundless conjecture as a source for her anxiety. Still, I find it distasteful to ridicule her to this extent.

Hey Guys,

Recently,  I've been drawn to Guru Rinpoche and different prayers to him. In particular the seven line prayer has been one of them due to it being talked about on the forum. I ended up memorizing the seven lined prayer and would like to memorize other prayers to Guru Rinpoche, but i wanted to know which prayers would be ok for a individual without transmission to recite? I would like to eventually receive transmission for all these prayers, but currently due to personal circumstance i may have to wait a while.

For example, is this prayer by Rigdzin Jigme Lingpa ok for everyone to recite if they wanted? i find it to be one of the most beautiful prayers I've seen and really would like to start reciting it if its ok.To Make the Tears Fall.pdf

Yes we can make the case from either side of her distress, as a companion or as an antagonist but this is still just the view of a person adhering t o the paradigm of their own mind's creation.

From the conventional point of view, we can say that the meditative equipoise of the Aryas is the subject and the Dharmadhatu is the object. And it is on such a basis that the Dharmadhatu can be considered an object of knowledge. It is quite acceptable to speak in such terms

Malcolm wrote:
This does not mean one is taking emptiness as a conceptual object. One is not meditating on the concept "this is the dharmadhātu" or "this is emptiness."

Now, when it is said that the Dharmata or the ultimate nature is not an object of knowledge, this means that since the dharmata transcends all conceptual constructs, it is not conceivable.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct, dharmatā is not a conceptual object. One does not meditate on the concept, "this is dharmatā."

cloudburst said:
Now, if the ultimate is not even the object of an Arya's mind, it would make no sense that it is through focusing on the ultimate that all the qualities of elimination and realization occur. If it is not cognized by the meditation of Aryas, this meditation ceases to be the subject that cognizes the Dharmadhatu.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct, but this is not a meditation on a concept, "this is emptiness."

The fault of which Gorampa, as well as Mipham etc., accuse Gelugpas is the assertion that it is appropriate to meditate on a conceptualized emptiness below the path of seeing.

Thus, your assertion that this Nyingmapa holds that it is proper to meditate on emptiness as a conceptual object is mistaken.

The other problem is that police departments regularly exclude people who are intelligent, because they are afraid intelligent people will not like the boredom of being a patrolman.

Everyone I know from high school who became a cop was either a bully or a quiet sociopath.

Which brings up another point -- psych evaluations and epidemiological studies on police violence as well as gun violence in general—— both of which the CDC (now being run by a quack) is forbidden by law from studying.

And weed, got to stop arresting black and brown people for weed-- need to legalize it, and decriminalize all drugs. The militarization of the police is directly linked to war on drugs, which we never were going to win (which everyone always knew).

Is there a time expiration or so to restore them? Once one is broken, just that one is lost, no? In order to take Bodhisattva Vows and Tantric vows, does one have to take all of the 5 lay vows first or are some like 1 or 2 enough? If one has taken all of them before, is it possible to give one of them back?

Malcolm wrote:
In order to receive the higher vows, the lower vows are required. But after being taken, one set of vows can be broken, without it necessarily impacting the others, apart from aspirational bodhicitta. If that is lost, everything is lost.

As far as the five upasaka vows go, one can choose to follow whichever vow one feels one can hold, beginning with not killing.

Archetypes and deities maybe part of the process, but you can use those things in ritual and meditation and not have it be tantra.

I don’t know what folks will think, but my working definition is that tantra is a technology of guruyoga, meant to achieve the state of the guru (or, more properly, to realize that our nature is not in any way different from the guru, who’s nature is not in anyway different from the Buddhas of the three times).

Any practice we do must be transmitted to us, otherwise whatever we’re doing, it isn’t tantra.
Any deity that we practice or accomplish might involve some archetypal energies and relative siddhis and all sorts of cool sh!t, but the essence of deityyoga is not to beomce the deity or contact it’s powers, but to do the deity practice given by the Lama to recognize that the deity is a representation of our own true nature from the beginning.

...I don’t think any of this is wrong, but I don’t know what folks will think of it as a definition of what tantra “is.”

But, even if my definition is not great; tantra is far more than just deity yoga. There are many practices that do not fall under the banner of deity yoga, even though of course that’s big.

I think your definition above of tantra is continuum is probably completely encompassing, but it seems like the title of traditional text wherein those of highest capacity can read it and fully understand the meaning by that alone, but those of us with less capacity need a little more elaboration and explication.
EDIT: I had missed your guhyasamaja quote, sorry. That is more comprehensive, but still needs clarification (IMO) for those of us with lesser capacities.

Late one night at the end of May, as spray paint, fires, and looting reigned across Minneapolis, an Indigenous hip-hop artist named Tall Paul was roving the streets in a truck, looking for looters and arsonists. “It looked like that movie The Purge,” he says. “It was lawless.” Days before, Paul had joined the American Indian Movement Patrol, a group of Native Americans volunteering to maintain neighborhood safety and protect key buildings from destruction amid the rebellion.

Paul and the other volunteers on shift were on their way to check on the offices of the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe when they saw four white teenagers looting a nearby liquor store. They stopped their truck and three of the teens fled, while Paul’s group caught up with the fourth. Soon his buddies returned, and all were made to lie on the ground so they couldn’t run away, then give their names and wait for a parent to come pick them up. The teens had driven 90 miles from suburban Wisconsin to take advantage of the chaos.

...

Though the current political moment focuses on violence against Black communities, police killings of Natives have long gone overlooked, in part because some departments don’t identify or track Indigenous victims. A CNN analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that Native Americans were slightly more likely than Black people to die at the hands of law enforcement between 1999 and 2015, though the rates are often neck-and-neck—and deeply intertwined.

In 2011, Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed George Floyd, was involved in the shooting of an Alaska Native named Leroy Martinez. (A witness claimed Martinez had surrendered his gun and had his hands in the air when he was shot.) Recognizing their common experience of police brutality, Native youth stood shoulder-to-shoulder with Black protesters throughout this year’s Minneapolis uprising.

The standard definition provided by everyone:

Guhyasamāja Uttaratantra states:

"A tantra is a ‘continuum,’
that continuum changes into three aspects;

the basis is “method”,
likewise, inalienability is the result;
these three summarize the meaning of tantra."

Lingpupa said:
But there is a difficulty here, surely - a "missing piece" if you will. Not to dispute your definition, of course, but definitions rarely, if ever, encompass the full meaning of a term, especially not the connotations of a richly loaded, culturally significant term. As a translator, you will of course know that only too well. And this (highly didactic) definition does not remotely touch on many of the topics raised by the word "tantra", does it?

Malcolm wrote:
It covers everything relevant to a discussion of Buddhist tantra. This is the reason why virtually all Indian and Tibetan authors use this verse as their launching point for a discussion of what "tantra" means.

So, when the inquirer asks, well, what does "continuum" mean here, it means that a "tantra" encompasses the basis, the path, and the result predicated on one's person's continuum, the nature of their mind. Then there are some books that describe these three things.

Lingpupa said:
How does your definition help them? How does it help them distinguish between art or liturgy that is more or less tantric and loosely similar artefacts that are not? How does it help them distinguish between fake, rip-off "tantra" (see most of what you'll find under that search) and genuine tantra such as you or I may perhaps know a little of?

True, but if you look at gun stats across the board, rifles are much safer than pistols. 65% of gun deaths are from pistols, only 5-10% from rifles. Most mass shootings also are pistols. Of rifles, the AR15 is actually really far down on the list as many rifle deaths are hunting incidents or the person used a hunting rifle for whatever reason. For a casual gun owner who wants to protect their home, a rifle is a better choice and safer for everyone involved. Contrary to what people say, the actual ballistics of an AR15 vs. a pistol shows the pistols are more deadly, pistols do huge amounts of damage to whoever they hit and are more likely to travel through people/objects/walls and strike innocents. You are also more likely to miss with a pistol. This is due to the effect of high velocity rifle rounds "tumbling" after they hit a target, losing a lot of power and momentum, vs a pistol whose rounds dont have this effect.

Malcolm wrote:
No, you are quite mistaken on this point. 222 rifles, which is effectively what an AR 15s are, have a much heavier charge and slug, and are much more damaging than pistol wounds. Just ask any surgeon who works in an ER. You are not talking to someone ignorant of weapons handling.

It is true that pistols are much less accurate, especially in the hands of people who lack specific firearms training for pistols. Even in the hands of trained law enforcement, pistols are very inaccurate. They have much less powerful rounds and actually do far less damage, according to surgeons.

Gyurme Kundrol said:
On the other hand you can look into incidents where people are for example robbed by 3 or more people at a time, all armed, and successfully defended themselves because they were armed.

Malcolm wrote:
This rarely happens in real life, but in the movies, well, quite a lot.


Gyurme Kundrol said:
Then there are many cases where people were not armed and they are simply executed, and I dont see how its better to be executed than to have a gun and defend yourself. Often these cases of violent robbery are not in the inner city, they are in rural areas where there are less people so nobody is going to hear the commotion or see anything happening.

Now yer just making shit up.


Gyurme Kundrol said:
I wish we lived in a world where I felt I never would need a gun for anything, but I just cant rationalize it to myself. There are other reasons the AR15 is safer too. For a civilian in a situation like that, you are going to have a HUGE adrenaline dump. Its hard enough to shoot a pistol accurately while calm and focused, its 10x harder when you are scared and violently shaking. A rifle is much more stable in that sense, and the 30 round capacity means you can afford to miss some shots without running out of ammo right away and being gunned down.

Malcolm wrote:
You do realize that these 30 round magazines jam regularly? Especially during a rapid rate of fire?

Serious question here though: From a Dharma perspective is there a good reason to not be prepared for that possible scenario?

Malcolm wrote:
Rifles, and guns in general, need regular maintenance and cleaning. It’s time consuming, easily neglected. Plus, one needs to spend regular time at a range. Shooting is a skill that needs to be maintained.

AR 15 style rifles are not particularly well made, and are not very accurate in general. They are also of little use in close quarters. Most shootings by civilians happen when people are standing within 25 feet of each other. Even with a rifle, most people miss their targets.

Most people are not capable of shooting another human being unless trained to, or in a state of panic. And panic is the enemy of accurate shooting.

Yes, We Mean Literally Abolish the Police

Unknown said:
Congressional Democrats want to make it easier to identify and prosecute police misconduct; Joe Biden wants to give police departments $300 million. But efforts to solve police violence through liberal reforms like these have failed for nearly a century.

Enough. We can’t reform the police. The only way to diminish police violence is to reduce contact between the public and the police.

There is not a single era in United States history in which the police were not a force of violence against black people. Policing in the South emerged from the slave patrols in the 1700 and 1800s that caught and returned runaway slaves. In the North, the first municipal police departments in the mid-1800s helped quash labor strikes and riots against the rich. Everywhere, they have suppressed marginalized populations to protect the status quo.

So when you see a police officer pressing his knee into a black man’s neck until he dies, that’s the logical result of policing in America. When a police officer brutalizes a black person, he is doing what he sees as his job.

Now two weeks of nationwide protests have led some to call for defunding the police, while others argue that doing so would make us less safe.

The first thing to point out is that police officers don’t do what you think they do. They spend most of their time responding to noise complaints, issuing parking and traffic citations, and dealing with other noncriminal issues. We’ve been taught to think they “catch the bad guys; they chase the bank robbers; they find the serial killers,” said Alex Vitale, the coordinator of the Policing and Social Justice Project at Brooklyn College, in an interview with Jacobin. But this is “a big myth,” he said. “The vast majority of police officers make one felony arrest a year. If they make two, they’re cop of the month.”

We can’t simply change their job descriptions to focus on the worst of the worst criminals. That’s not what they are set up to do.

Second, a “safe” world is not one in which the police keep black and other marginalized people in check through threats of arrest, incarceration, violence and death.

I’ve been advocating the abolition of the police for years. Regardless of your view on police power — whether you want to get rid of the police or simply to make them less violent — here’s an immediate demand we can all make: Cut the number of police in half and cut their budget in half. Fewer police officers equals fewer opportunities for them to brutalize and kill people. The idea is gaining traction in Minneapolis, Dallas, Los Angeles and other cities.

History is instructive, not because it offers us a blueprint for how to act in the present but because it can help us ask better questions for the future.

The Lexow Committee undertook the first major investigation into police misconduct in New York City in 1894. At the time, the most common complaint against the police was about “clubbing” — “the routine bludgeoning of citizens by patrolmen armed with nightsticks or blackjacks,” as the historian Marilynn Johnson has written.

The Wickersham Commission, convened to study the criminal justice system and examine the problem of Prohibition enforcement, offered a scathing indictment in 1931, including evidence of brutal interrogation strategies. It put the blame on a lack of professionalism among the police.

After the 1967 urban uprisings, the Kerner Commission found that “police actions were ‘final’ incidents before the outbreak of violence in 12 of the 24 surveyed disorders.” Its report listed a now-familiar set of recommendations, like working to build “community support for law enforcement” and reviewing police operations “in the ghetto, to ensure proper conduct by police officers.”

These commissions didn’t stop the violence; they just served as a kind of counterinsurgent function each time police violence led to protests. Calls for similar reforms were trotted out in response to the brutal police beating of Rodney King in 1991 and the rebellion that followed, and again after the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner. The final report of the Obama administration’s President’s Task Force on 21st Century Policing resulted in procedural tweaks like implicit-bias training, police-community listening sessions, slight alterations of use-of-force policies and systems to identify potentially problematic officers early on.

But even a member of the task force, Tracey Meares, noted in 2017, “policing as we know it must be abolished before it can be transformed.”

The philosophy undergirding these reforms is that more rules will mean less violence. But police officers break rules all the time. Look what has happened over the past few weeks — police officers slashing tires, shoving old men on camera, and arresting and injuring journalists and protesters. These officers are not worried about repercussions any more than Daniel Pantaleo, the former New York City police officer whose chokehold led to Eric Garner’s death; he waved to a camera filming the incident. He knew that the police union would back him up and he was right. He stayed on the job for five more years.

Minneapolis had instituted many of these “best practices” but failed to remove Derek Chauvin from the force despite 17 misconduct complaints over nearly two decades, culminating in the entire world watching as he knelt on George Floyd’s neck for almost nine minutes.

Why on earth would we think the same reforms would work now? We need to change our demands. The surest way of reducing police violence is to reduce the power of the police, by cutting budgets and the number of officers.

But don’t get me wrong. We are not abandoning our communities to violence. We don’t want to just close police departments. We want to make them obsolete.

We should redirect the billions that now go to police departments toward providing health care, housing, education and good jobs. If we did this, there would be less need for the police in the first place.

We can build other ways of responding to harms in our society. Trained “community care workers” could do mental-health checks if someone needs help. Towns could use restorative-justice models instead of throwing people in prison.

What about rape? The current approach hasn’t ended it. In fact most rapists never see the inside of a courtroom. Two-thirds of people who experience sexual violence never report it to anyone. Those who file police reports are often dissatisfied with the response. Additionally, police officers themselves commit sexual assault alarmingly often. A study in 2010 found that sexual misconduct was the second most frequently reported form of police misconduct. In 2015, The Buffalo News found that an officer was caught for sexual misconduct every five days.

When people, especially white people, consider a world without the police, they envision a society as violent as our current one, merely without law enforcement — and they shudder. As a society, we have been so indoctrinated with the idea that we solve problems by policing and caging people that many cannot imagine anything other than prisons and the police as solutions to violence and harm.

People like me who want to abolish prisons and police, however, have a vision of a different society, built on cooperation instead of individualism, on mutual aid instead of self-preservation. What would the country look like if it had billions of extra dollars to spend on housing, food and education for all? This change in society wouldn’t happen immediately, but the protests show that many people are ready to embrace a different vision of safety and justice.

When the streets calm and people suggest once again that we hire more black police officers or create more civilian review boards, I hope that we remember all the times those efforts have failed.

Me, I'm just happy to see white people and conservatives who have never cared much about the inequities of the justice system, police brutality etc. getting all uncomfortable. Your protest against their protest just proves the need for their protest, from my point of view.

No reports of violence going on, unlike the crowds of people like the Proud Bys etc. who have showed up at protests to threaten people, run over people and all kinds of ugliness. Funnily enough the same people complaining about this didn't care about those things.

If you follow how Vasubandhu defines prajñā, it is primarily the faculty of analytical discernment. It is also one of the ten neutral mental factors.

It appears you are using the term in one of its Mahāyāna senses, i.e., the sixth perfection, prajñāpāramitā, transcendent wisdom. But there wouldn't be any need for a perfection of wisdom if wisdom is "something far more direct/meditative." I still think you are conflating prajñā with jñāna, since the latter, unlike prajñā, is in fact direct intuition in the philosophical sense of the term, where as prajñā is principally analytical.

Dr. Berzin translates the sixth perfection as "discriminating awareness, wisdom"

Which sounds very different from "transcendent wisdom" to me.

At least I would like to understand, in your system, how you translate ynana if using "transcendent wisdom" for the sixth perfection.

To be honest, it occurs to me that it is not possible to find the perfectly fitting English translations for single terms. Which shows it is best to use the Sankrit words.

Now, scientists have shown — at least in the tightly controlled environment of a laboratory cell culture — that viruses carrying that particular mutation infect more cells and are more resilient than those without it.

Geneticists cautioned against drawing conclusions about whether the variant, which has been circulating widely since February, spreads more easily in humans. There is no evidence that it is more deadly or harmful, and differences seen in a cell culture do not necessarily mean it is more contagious, they said.

But the new study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, does show that this mutation appears to change the biological function of the virus, experts said. The insight could be a crucial first step in understanding how the mutation behaves at a biomolecular level.

Researchers at Scripps Research, Florida, found that the mutation, known as D614G, stabilized the virus’s spike proteins, which protrude from the viral surface and give the coronavirus its name. The number of functional and intact spikes on each viral particle was about five times higher because of this mutation, they found.

By contrast, Won-ch'uk, a disciple of Xuantsang, by contrast treats the theme extensively in his three volume Āryagambhīrasaṃdhinirmocanasūtraṭīkā ((D 4016).

Of the Indian authors represented in the bstan 'gyur, where they give chronologies of the teachings, they tend to do so principally in commentaries on the tantras.

FromTheEarth said:
Very interesting—raised and mostly immersed in the East Asian tradition, I have not noticed this before. Surely the idea of a classification of Buddha's teachings should have other sources (some early Chinese classification systems do not have this chronological model at all). For instance, ideas as the distinction between definitive and provisional teachings, and that the Buddha addressed different audience differently, both of which seem to be more common themes in sutras and should have traces in treatises such as Mahāyāna-samgraha. Still, the fact you pointed out is indeed eye-opening.

Malcolm wrote:
The distinctions between provisional and definitive teachings have two major sources: Akṣayamatinirdeśa Sūtra, and the Samdhinirmocana. Madhyamakas follow the former while Yogacārins follow the latter. The Indian Madhyamaka approach is that if it is about emptiness, absence of identity, etc., it is definitive, everything else is provisional. The Samdhinirmocana seems to assert that its own class of sūtras are definitive because they purport to resolve controversies over the meaning of the Prajñāpāramita sūtra and so on.

In Tibet, the tathāgatagarbha sūtras are either provisional or definitive depending on how they are interpreted, and how closely one follows Candrakīrti, who clearly follows the Lanka in regarding tathagātagarbha as an expedient teaching. Despite some pushback by some Tibetan interpreters of Yogacāra, Candra's presentation of Madhyamaka is universally regarded as the definitive expression of Madhyamaka in Tibet.

Poverty is generational. Over the years I always had in the back of my mind a phrase that I assumed was just a expression, a term coined by and a justification of the political class that there exists two states, the warfare state and the welfare state, and that's just how it is. Now if you apply that and look at governance in which ever flavor you wish to adhere too, it's pretty accurate. To govern or rule, whether your a dictator, a despot, a king or a prime minister, a president etc, whichever fancy title of nobility you like, you need three spheres of control to rule. You need the money supply ( treasury), you need the sword (military), and you need the faith ( church ). Missing any of those three aspects and your cooked. So if you look at the current conditions around you, apply those three to anybody in control and see if they truly are in control.

Assuming we don't get our shit together, covid-19 will take a million lives in the US before it is all over.

Climate change, habitat destruction, etc., is nothing to be MOR about. For example, one of the root causes of the explosion of Lyme disease is that when the passenger pigeons were all slaughtered, this caused an explosion in the white-foot mouse population, since the seeds that have previously mostly been consumed by the pigeons were not consumed by mice, in addition to increasing pressure on forests in the NE through suburban developments.

Team freedom when it was citizens concerned with government over reach into private citizens lives was condemned. Yet now the same medi decrying white nationalists during protests, are praising recent protests and riots as for the greater good, pandemic lockdown be damned. Do as we say, not as we do.

Yes, I really mean maha -karuna. Adding the prefix 'great' to ordinary compassion doesn't cut it for me, because I think we're really trying to describe something incredibly vast and profound.

Compassion per se has too much Christian and western moral philosophy baggage. As Simon E points out, it often implies something very partial, affective and sentimental. Something like Hume's notion of sympathy.

Most of this I'm plagiarizing from DKR; I think he's right.

Another one to leave alone: prajna. Even just for aesthetic reasons - it is so beautiful and so perfect in the Sanskrit.

Wisdom serves just fine for prajna, which no one pronounces correctly anyway (it’s pragnya). Great compassion is also just fine, unless it is a name, for example, four-armed Avalokiteshvara is Mahakarunika.

Mr. Cole said:
Hey guys,


I recently became a member of one of the sister websites of this one, but I'm not sure if all, or even any, of the members of the other chat room are members of this one, so I will simply repost my introduction from that chat room here:


Hello everyone!


My name is Cole. This is literally my first day on this forum. Actually, this is the first time I've ever been on a forum like this. My social media life is kinda basic, but, ya know, nothing like being a 20-something-year-old Boomer!



Anyways, a little background about myself: I'm from the United States. I am currently pursuing my M.A. in theology, and a few years back graduated with my B.A. in theology as well. As you can probably tell from this, my area of expertise is theology, particularly Christian theology, and, more specifically Catholic theology (the denomination I am a member of), though, because I have spent a lot of time studying the Church Fathers and the Medieval Scholastics (think, in the Western Christian tradition, people like St. Thomas Aquinas, St. Anselm, St. Bonaventure, etc.), and these guys make use of a lot of philosophy, I do study philosophy as a sort of secondary area of interest.



For me, studying Catholic theology, and Christian theology more generally, is really the epitome of a passion for me. It lies at the crossroads of my personal/spiritual interests (more specifically my relationship with God, which is really the center of my sense of personal identity) and my intellectual/academic/professional interests. Yet, the academic that I am, if I could do nothing but study every known religion, I would. It's not that I am doubting my Catholic faith, or am necessarily convinced of the merits of Buddhist thought; rather, let me put it like this: if intellectual gluttony were a thing, I would have it bad. ANYTHING concerning philosophy and theology is fair game for me. The biggest issue for me is choosing just one area of expertise. I'll admit that my knowledge of Buddhism is somewhat limited, and, as someone thinking from mostly a Western standpoint, I frequently make a lot of category errors when trying to speak of Buddhism. Nonetheless, I have a list of books and articles on Buddhism a mile long I want to read, and I'm always looking for more suggestions.



But what really put me over the edge was how a friend of mine is a Buddhist. He too takes an interest in theology and philosophy, and we frequently get in a lot of debates and discussions on religion and philosophy. When we hung out the other day, he recommended this website. I'm not sure if he is a member of just visits it from time to time, but he said there were a lot of interesting discussions on here, particularly from a lot of people with a deep knowledge of both Western and Buddhist thought, who often compared the two or were good at providing critiques of Western thought from a Buddhist perspective. I have a lot of questions on Buddhism, and so thought I'd join.



Thus, in a word, thanks for having me aboard. Have a great day!

From a Buddhist point of view, we look at all of this from a multi lifetime perspective, positive and negative karma of infinite sentient beings working itself out, without error. But since we are not omniscient, and therefore cannot assign specific causation, wherever we see true inequality and injustice, we say something about it.

Anyways, we talked for like 10 minutes and he said he cannot wait for this coronvirus stuff to be over, so things can get back to normal. He then brought up the protests (George Floyd) and said i hope they dont spread the coronavirus even more. Here i was in a public place and talking with a black man, and i am not racist and never thought twice about it, but now given the current situation and how quickly people will react or judge you for what you say, i was surprised he himself brought up the protests. As a good decent human being that i am, i spoke honestly and from my heart and told him what i felt about the possible spread of the virus right now. I said it is not the time to be out there protesting in the thousands during a pandemic. He listened to me and there was no conflict. We both were allowed to say whatever we wanted and listened to each other. There was no racism on either end, as far as i can tell.

If I am not bothering you (otherwise please feel free to ignore me), this, the first sentence above, again is a very strong claim...A scholarly plausible view (just like when you challenged the traditional narrative of the authorship of the Mahāprajñāpāramitopadeśa) should press one toward the second option.

Malcolm wrote:
If you examine the available literature in Tibetan translation on the subject, we find that for example, Asanga, Vasubandhu, Sthiramati, etc., devote virtually no time at all to explicating the distinction between the three turnings of the wheel, which itself is given a single passage in the Sandhinirmocana Sūtra. And Maitreyanatha seems to dismiss the idea of the three turnings being successive in the first pages of the Sūtra-laṃkara.

By contrast, Won-ch'uk, a disciple of Xuantsang, by contrast treats the theme extensively in his three volume Āryagambhīrasaṃdhinirmocanasūtraṭīkā ((D 4016).

Of the Indian authors represented in the bstan 'gyur, where they give chronologies of the teachings, they tend to do so principally in commentaries on the tantras.

Yes, I really mean maha -karuna. Adding the prefix 'great' to ordinary compassion doesn't cut it for me, because I think we're really trying to describe something incredibly vast and profound.

Compassion per se has too much Christian and western moral philosophy baggage. As Simon E points out, it often implies something very partial, affective and sentimental. Something like Hume's notion of sympathy.

Most of this I'm plagiarizing from DKR; I think he's right.

Another one to leave alone: prajna. Even just for aesthetic reasons - it is so beautiful and so perfect in the Sanskrit.

Malcolm wrote:
Wisdom serves just fine for prajna, which no one pronounces correctly anyway (it’s pragnya). Great compassion is also just fine, unless it is a name, for example, four-armed Avalokiteshvara is Mahakarunika.

But in whatsoever Dhamma and Discipline there is found the Noble Eightfold Path, there is found a true ascetic of the first, second, third, and fourth degrees of saintliness.[54] Now in this Dhamma and Discipline, Subhadda, is found the Noble Eightfold Path; and in it alone are also found true ascetics of the first, second, third, and fourth degrees of saintliness. Devoid of true ascetics are the systems of other teachers. But if, Subhadda, the bhikkhus live righteously, the world will not be destitute of arahats.
My only question is, what do you say about HHDL and His Eminence Professor Samdhong Rinpoche saying that Buddhism is not the only path, only religion. They both even encourage those of other religions to stick with their own religions, instead of becoming Buddhists, if they can. Take what is useful, helpful from Buddhism, but you can still practice your own religion. Only if one is really interested in Buddhism and investigated it and want to become a Buddhist, would they say it is okay. Otherwise stick with your own religion. They also relate religions to different foods, some prefer this taste (particular religion) over that taste (another religion).

Advising people not to convert is not an endorsement of the idea that what is meant by liberation in Buddhism is shared with other faiths.

I'm suggesting that the rhetoric of tantric empowerment is that it is often described as starting with the abhiṣeka of the Buddhas of the ten directions that Mahāyāna practitioners are generally believed to receive at the 10th bhūmi and that the maṇḍala wherein it takes place is the akaniṣṭa ghanavyūha. I could be wrong though.

Bristollad said:
But just because "it is often described as starting with the abhiṣeka of the Buddhas of the ten directions that Mahāyāna practitioners are generally believed to receive at the 10th bhūmi" doesn't mean that a tantric practitioner is necessarily a bodhisattva on the 10th bhumi.  If that were the case, the rhetoric of tantra being a swifter path wouldn't make much sense - one would have already completed 3 countless aeons of merit gathering the same as the Perfection vehicle.

Caoimhghín said:
"Is often described" was simply me being humble. I can take it back if it caused confusion.

So we're dealing with different assignments of the "tathāgatabhūmi," which as I understand some Tantrikas place at an "11th" station, 10th-stage bhūmikas being merely bodhisattvas. So when I say "the abhiṣeka of the Buddhas of the ten directions that Mahāyāna practitioners [...] receive at the 10th bhūmi" I am talking about what you might consider the 11th bhūmi. We can just discard this "specific enumeration of bhūmi" business as well, since it's causing problems. 11th, 10th aside, we're talking "samyaksaṁbuddhatva," and that's what's important, "(complete) Buddhahood-in-this-life," not "the irreversible grounds," not "śrāvakabuddhatva," etc. Otherwise, Vajrayāna just a free-for-all redefining of terms from Mahāyāna. And yes, I'm fully aware that there are contingency plans for when practitioners receive this abhiṣeka and it's evident that nothing important has really happened and no realization has accompanied their empowerment. The point is, if you need your sadhāna to facilitate your accumulations, then you never actually received the abhiṣeka of the Buddhas of the ten directions in the first place. They don't hand those out to just anyone.

I thought the 52 stages scheme was from the Bodhisattva keyūra mūla karma sūtra? The Avatamsaka Sutra itself teaches the 40 something stages, Fazang also adapted the Keyura sutra's scheme, and then there's the Shurangama's 57 stages?.

Caoimhghín said:
50+ bhūmi schemata show up in Shugendō and Daoist-Buddhist hybrid scriptures as well. I've never read the Keyūrasūtra, and I can't find that much about it. I certainly wouldn't want to call it apocryphal, not knowing that for sure, but it wouldn't surprise me. Talking about the Śūraṅgama, do you mean the Indian Śūraṅgamasamādhisūtra or the Chinese Śūraṅgama?

The Buddhāvataṁsaka supposedly lays out the 52 bodhisattva stages, but then once you get to its nested Daśabhūmikasūtra, there are only 10. I've never read the bulk of the Buddhāvataṁsaka. It's just too massive. Supposedly, chapters 15, 21, 22, 25, and 26 lay out grounds 1-40 in successive enumerations of ten bhūmis. I think the Indian tradition was that all of these lists of 10 bhūmis are the same 10 bhūmis, but I'm not actually sure there, so I'd need to read a bit. Am I going to be jumped on for daring to admit that I'm not sure of something? We'll find out next time on DharmaWheel!

The WHO was not "Walking Back its Claim" but trying to clarify a complicated issue. If you want a less biased and more informative version of the same story, try (our) ABC:
Key points:

Contract tracing in some countries has found the spread of coronavirus by asymptomatic people is rare
Singapore health officials have suggested half of the country's cases were symptomless
The lack of spread by asymptomatic people could be because they do not cough and sneeze as much

The spread of coronavirus by those who do not show any symptoms appears to be "very rare", says a World Health Organization official.

Data from countries with advanced contract tracing measures seem to show the highly contagious virus is not being spread by those who are asymptomatic, according to WHO epidemiologist Maria van Kerkhove.

"It is very rare, and much of that is not published in the literature," Dr van Kerhove said. ...

"We have a number of reports from countries who are doing very detailed contact tracing," Dr van Kerkhove told a WHO media briefing overnight.

"They are following asymptomatic cases, following contacts and not finding secondary transmission."

This is too idealistic for me, especially the suggestion that community services and social workers are going to be replacing police. Working for CPS, we do not detain children without law enforcement present, for good reason. People generally aren’t happy to be told their children need to be removed from their care. They get volatile. They get assaultive. You can’t usually wait a month or two and reason with an abusive parent, unless you don’t mind having possible blood on your hands. Dealing with people who will abuse a child, whether sexually, physically or emotionally, etc who may or may not be under the influence of substances and who may or may not have untreated mental health, is high risk. And guess what, most of them think they were doing just fine until the social worker came and ruined their life, they don’t need help (so they say)...

Overall people need services not “punishment,” but a lot of people will not do the right thing or services by some call to their higher self, they need wrathful means to get them there. I say this all because me and my coworkers often rely on the support of law enforcement when we have to open that door, talk to that irate parent, and defuse a potentially violent situation at 3am. Btw, I’m a social worker because I believe in people’s ability to change and in social justice. I just don’t think defunding the police is the right way to change things.

Malcolm wrote:
Defunding the police does not mean completely removing security professionals from communities or as adjuncts social service workers. It means completely reframing what we understand the role of security professionals to be.

In many places the police presently are the only social services there are. And they are not properly trained for many of the demands placed upon them. On the other hand, they are often funded at levels social service workers cannot even imagine unless they are actively reading the budgets for their own communities.

It means reframing the whole idea of community security so that the police cease behaving like an occupying force in black and brown communities. Compton, CA and Camden, NJ, provide a good model. Hopefully Minneapolis will follow this course.

TharpaChodron said:
I’m all for some reframing, retraining and more education for LE. The community policing idea seems a bit uncertain though. Like when it comes to domestic violence. The Hmong community have been doing community policing unofficially for years, leading to women’s voices and abuse being silenced by elders, underreported, fear of community shaming. Maybe having an outside arbiter provides anonymity and safety for victims  sometimes. I do like the idea of having police go out with community service/social workers in joint responses.

Malcolm wrote:
I am not talking about community policing as commonly understood. But I am talking about completely redefining what "policing" means:

TharpaChodron said:
In cities, increasing urbanization rendered the night-watch system completely useless as communities got too big. The first publicly funded, organized police force with officers on duty full-time was created in Boston in 1838. Boston was a large shipping commercial center, and businesses had been hiring people to protect their property and safeguard the transport of goods from the port of Boston to other places, says Potter. These merchants came up with a way to save money by transferring to the cost of maintaining a police force to citizens by arguing that it was for the “collective good.”

In the South, however, the economics that drove the creation of police forces were centered not on the protection of shipping interests but on the preservation of the slavery system. Some of the primary policing institutions there were the slave patrols tasked with chasing down runaways and preventing slave revolts, Potter says; the first formal slave patrol had been created in the Carolina colonies in 1704. During the Civil War, the military became the primary form of law enforcement in the South, but during Reconstruction, many local sheriffs functioned in a way analogous to the earlier slave patrols, enforcing segregation and the disenfranchisement of freed slaves.

...

For example, businessmen in the late 19th century had both connections to politicians and an image of the kinds of people most likely to go on strike and disrupt their workforce. So it’s no coincidence that by the late 1880s, all major U.S. cities had police forces. Fears of labor-union organizers and of large waves of Catholic, Irish, Italian, German, and Eastern European immigrants, who looked and acted differently from the people who had dominated cities before, drove the call for the preservation of law and order, or at least the version of it promoted by dominant interests. For example, people who drank at taverns rather than at home were seen as “dangerous” people by others, but they might have pointed out other factors such as how living in a smaller home makes drinking in a tavern more appealing. (The irony of this logic, Potter points out, is that the businessmen who maintained this belief were often the ones who profited off of the commercial sale of alcohol in public places.)

Malcolm wrote:
https://time.com/4779112/police-history-origins/

What we can see from this is that business externalized the cost of protecting their goods and slaves onto communities. We can see from the above that the job of the police in the US has always to protect the interests of capitalists first and foremost. That must end.

Yes, none are worth dying on a hill for.

No one for example attempts to translate Bodhicitta by one single word of a modern European language yet we persist with other terms which are just as nuanced.

Before its police reforms, Camden was routinely named one of the most violent cities in the US.
Now, seven years after the old department was booted, the city's crime has dropped by close to half. Officers host outdoor parties for residents and knock on doors to introduce themselves. It's a radically different Camden than it was even a decade ago. Here's how they did it.

Abolishing the police would have the opposite of its intended effects. It would not help the poor and disadvantaged communities. The rich and wealthy would just hire private security guards and companies. Many of them already do that. Just look at some "exclusive" neighborhoods, many with guard gated entrances that lead you to additional interior gated areas and then there are roving patrols, bicycle patrols, foot patrols, all privately funded from their HOA funds. The poor communities cannot afford this and would be left without any security.

This must end. There is no justification at all for the militarization of the police force, a lack of enforced federal standards for peacetime officer training, and so on.

If I am not bothering you (otherwise please feel free to ignore me), this, the first sentence above, again is a very strong claim.
We do not have much literature which reliably described how ordinary ancient Indian Buddhists practiced Buddhism. However, the production of the Mahayana sutras (from a secular scholarship point of view), and their dissemination, must indicate the "authors"/copiers/audience's strong interest in the major themes therewithin. Maybe some of those themes have less representation in the more prominent Buddhist scholars' works, which dominated the high-end, intellectual discourse. However, I won't doubt that, when they became circulated among ancient Indian Buddhists, some of those Mahayana sutras were often used to defend the authority of Mahayana, help figure out the relation between the Sravakayana doctrines and the revolutionary new ones, clarify the apparent contradictions among different teachings, etc. And those sutras (usually in a more accessible genre full of allegories and stories) formed the framework within which many, both monastic and lay, comprehended the Buddhadharma. (One example is that not many ancient Indian Buddhist scholars composed text on tathagatagarbha or spoke of it very positively, in stark contrast with, say, the abundance of sutras that highlighted such theme. The latter should be indicative of the larger audience's interest due to the theme's soteriological significance).
My contention throughout has been that when you refer to "Indian Buddhists" and say they had little interest in A, B, and C, it should be clearly distinguished whether you mean most ancient Indian Buddhists or the scholars whose works survived today. A scholarly plausible view (just like when you challenged the traditional narrative of the authorship of the Mahāprajñāpāramitopadeśa) should press one toward the second option.

It’s definitely true that the snapshot of Indian Buddhism that Tibetans took was later than the largely  Central-Asian filtered Buddhism which had the most influence on Chinese Buddhism.  But, for  example, Zi yi’s interpretation of the four siddhantas owes nothing observable to Indian Buddhism, nor his fivefold division of Buddhist texts, etc. I personally think part of the reason for this difference between the two is that Chinese Buddhism suffered a severe setback in 845, when it was nearly completely purged from China, as did Tibetan Buddhism, with the assassination of Langdarma in 841. And the greatest flowering of Chinese Buddhist thought took place after the fall of the Guptas in 495. This 250 year period is arguably the high point in Classical Chinese Buddhism. At the same time, Indian Buddhism was on institutionally shaky ground, recovering from the invasion of the white Huns and under increasing pressure from hostile Hindu Kings; and during the last 100 years of this period, Central Asian Buddhism was being encroached upon by Muslims. By the 11th century, Buddhist text translation into Chinese was increasingly rare.

I would say that while Zhiyi certainly took inspiration from Indian sources, his exegetical methodology is unique, more like Huayen than Sanlun, for example.

FromTheEarth said:
I agree with the last point about methodology as there has never been a ground for proper Buddhist scholasticism in China, and the Chinese commentators struggled to put through their systems eventually (and more eagerly than their Tibetan colleagues when it comes to the problems arising from sutras). But first, let me just defend Zhiyi from the two specific ones you mentioned. Though modern scholars doubt the authorship of Mahāprajñāpāramitopadeśa, that commentary was traditionally attributed to Nagarjuna. Caoimhghín has suggested this above; but it seems clear that Zhiyi's talk about the four siddhantas was directly derived from this commentary.



Malcolm wrote:
I have no reason to doubt Zhi Yi’s sincere faith in the Mahāprajñāpāramitopadeśa. There is zero chance that Nagarjuna composed this text, however. So my point still stands.


FromTheEarth said:
Regarding the fivefold divisions, the specific way he divided the scriptures was surely his own. But the idea that Buddha's teachings contained several stages was a common theme in Mahayana scriptures; and that there was a somehow fivefold structure, a gradual development from Agama sutras to Mahayana sutras then to Prajna sutras then to the Mahaparinirvana sutra, has solid textual basis in the Mahaparinirvana Sutra (scroll 14).

This is too idealistic for me, especially the suggestion that community services and social workers are going to be replacing police. Working for CPS, we do not detain children without law enforcement present, for good reason. People generally aren’t happy to be told their children need to be removed from their care. They get volatile. They get assaultive. You can’t usually wait a month or two and reason with an abusive parent, unless you don’t mind having possible blood on your hands. Dealing with people who will abuse a child, whether sexually, physically or emotionally, etc who may or may not be under the influence of substances and who may or may not have untreated mental health, is high risk. And guess what, most of them think they were doing just fine until the social worker came and ruined their life, they don’t need help (so they say)...

Overall people need services not “punishment,” but a lot of people will not do the right thing or services by some call to their higher self, they need wrathful means to get them there. I say this all because me and my coworkers often rely on the support of law enforcement when we have to open that door, talk to that irate parent, and defuse a potentially violent situation at 3am. Btw, I’m a social worker because I believe in people’s ability to change and in social justice. I just don’t think defunding the police is the right way to change things.

Malcolm wrote:
Defunding the police does not mean completely removing security professionals from communities or as adjuncts social service workers. It means completely reframing what we understand the role of security professionals to be.

In many places the police presently are the only social services there are. And they are not properly trained for many of the demands placed upon them. On the other hand, they are often funded at levels social service workers cannot even imagine unless they are actively reading the budgets for their own communities.

It means reframing the whole idea of community security so that the police cease behaving like an occupying force in black and brown communities. Compton, CA and Camden, NJ, provide a good model. Hopefully Minneapolis will follow this course.

No, that is not the point. Of course Tibetans, like the Chinese, have doctrinal concerns removed from what Indian Mahāyāna Buddhists cared about.

Well, this actually leads back to the previous point I made, which is that Indian Mahayana is not equivalent to, say, a scholastic part of its, represented by the so-called "Indian masters" and their works, while such group of masters seems also highly selective. I would be happy to accept a statement such like the Tibetans were more concerned with "how well a given position might comport with" certain Indian masters they favored or happened to be more popular; while a fairly informed picture of ancient Indian Mahayana, even just the intellectual, scholastic dimension of it, must include a proper presentation of Yogacara and some other branches, whose existence again seems better to be found in the East Asian canons and traditions.

Also, I would like to argue, whomever you may have in mind when referring to the "Indian masters," a large of number of them should be dated later than the founders of several dominant Chinese Buddhist schools (here I limit these schools to the doctrine-based such as Tiantai, Huayan, Sanlun etc., for Chan/Zen and Pureland masters seemed less interested in doing comprehensive exegetical work). To my knowledge, except for Huayan, all other doctrinally-oriented schools as such fit the description of caring about how their interpretations "comport with Indian masters" at their disposal (you would found abundant reference to Nagarjuna, Asanga, and Vasubandhu's works in Zhiyi's and Jizang's works), as did the Tibetans. And, one may argue, the Chinese Buddhist scholars tried even harder to make their positions aligned with sutras and other Indian commentaries of a less doctrinally-dense genre, i.e., upadeśa texts. And, any reasonable conception of ancient Indian Mahayana must include those texts also.

Because you don't seem to be too interested in communicating, I think that what you might actually be doing is virtue-signalling to your right-wing companions on DhammaWheel and DWE.

Many writers have sought to establish a link between the Bön religion of Tibet and the shamanic traditions of Siberia. These attempts are largely unsystematic and piecemeal, and the results have been unconvincing. This remarkable book is the most thorough attempt to date to explore these connections. On the basis of wide-ranging scholarship as well as a long and close association with the most eminent exponents of the traditions he explores, the author presents the richness of Tibetan Bön and Buryatian Bө Murgel, discerning beneath the distinctive features of these systems a matrix of beliefs and practices in which they have their origins. Written from an "emic" perspective of sympathy with the tenets of Bön and Bө Murgel, this fascinating and provocative book is sure to stimulate interest and debate concerning the religious heritage of Inner Asia.'

I agree with Donald Trumps take on it: "I am a big fan of Drew Brees. I think he’s truly one of the greatest quarterbacks, but he should not have taken back his original stance on honoring our magnificent American Flag. OLD GLORY is to be revered, cherished, and flown high..."

Thank God there is still Fox News that is sticking up for peoples rights, like Drew Brees. I watched a great short clip the other day with Tucker Carlson and Burgess Owens, and he said, it is this kind of mob mentality that will ensure that Trump wins again.

I have been using this phrase, "All lives matter" for many years now and it has no connection to me to any other movement or reaction. It is just common sense, is rational, logical, sane. To separate humanity into black or white, christian or buddhist, capitalist or communist, that is the problem, this division, we are all ONE! That phrase is definitely anything but racist! It brings us together, does not separate or exclude in the least. It even includes insects, animals, trees, everything that is alive.

I have never really heard teachers talk openly about topics such as the question asked even to advanced students. The common pattern seems to be: teacher visits place XYZ for a retreat. There gives empowerment, direct introduction, a text is being explained. In astonishingly few cases the teacher also gives you concrete meditation instructions including an explanation of the expected effects. If you are lucky, you get a 10 minutes interview slot in a 2 week retreat with the teacher. After 2 weeks the teacher travels further.

So: Unless you are doing a 3 years retreat or similar, or unless you are able to read old Tibetan, getting answers to questions such as the one above is not really offered by anyone.

Now, maybe that's even a good thing, I don't want to judge it. There are good reasons why certain things are rarely openly discussed. But telling others to "go and seek a good teacher" is, in my view, more or less same as telling people off. Name me one teacher who, when a foreign person shows up and asks about details of menngagde teachings, will openly explain things to that person. Why should s/he? The person could be mad, could want to publish stuff on the internet etc. You don't know him/her, so rather be careful. This means: No, "go ask a teacher" will not get you any further in most cases. And not everyone has the energy or the money left to travel to exotic places to find another teacher to ask.

Yes, I agree. In a small country (half the population of NYC) with basically one level of government it's much easier to make certain changes.

If both schools focus is on becoming a Buddha, why would one choose Mahayana (The much slower school) versus Vajrayana

Malcolm wrote:
First of all, Vajrayāna is Mahāyāna. The principle difference between common Mahāyāna and Uncommon Mahāyāna Secret Mantra is methodology. However, these distinctions are Indian. East Asian Buddhists have a whole different scheme that was arrived at in China and Japan, not India. That does not mean they are ipso facto invalid. Another issue is that Indian Mahāyāna survives only in Tibetan Buddhism, where it is taught for theory, but not for practice. For practice, Tibetan Buddhists teach various types of Vajrayāna practice.

Indian Mahāyāna is not really taught in Chinese Buddhism. The Chinese Buddhists have developed an independent understanding of Mahāyāna which is very distinct from Indian Mahāyāna. Nevertheless, there are certain fundamental commonalities since all Mahāyāna traditions are based on Mahāyāna sūtras.

As I said, Brees is clueless. I hope he gets educated. He's paid to chuck a football, which he's very good at, not give informed political opinions.
P.S. - Buddha was a revolutionary, he went against the stream, the current, what people believed at his time. He questioned all, doubted all, did not accept God or a permanent self/atman. It took great courage on his part to speak what he saw and felt, even though it went against the norm. Never forget that Buddha himself was a true revolutionary, revolted against the whole system and beliefs of his time. He challenged all.

I dont want to make this about Trump. But have to ask, does it matter if he voted for Trump or not, likes him or not? What does his political beliefs have to do whether he is a good decent human being or not?

This is where i get confused, i see a lot of put downs of Trump on here and saying you cannot be a Buddhist and like Trump, or something like that.

You already have enough to do with practicing rushan, etc. These are the preliminary practices for thogal and the enhancement practices for trekcho. Further, while the four visions do occur in longde, Longde texts do not explain the theoretical side. So you should make effort to listen to Lama Chonam's lung of the Tshog don mdzod. That text as the complete theoretical foundation you are looking for. When Norbu Rinpoche gave transmission, he did not just give transmission for one series of Dzogchen or another. He gave a unified transmission. But the instructions for all three series need to be sought out separately. And in the case of Longde, also the Ngondzog Gyalpo empowerment is required.

Indeed and they should rightly be condemned. Thuggish behaviour is totally unacceptable.

Once again you want to address this, but apparently think that generational decades of racist violence is either equivalent, or even less important. If that weren't the case you wouldn't keep bringing this up, because you'd have different priorities here.
I don't think they are equivalent. One is obviously worse than the other, but both are morally reprehensible.

I don't care.
Splendid!

A "socialist problem"? Aren't you in the UK? We don't and have never even had a labor party, much less a socialist party. What a cockamamie statement.
I do indeed. I actually live in Cymru (Wales), where we have had a Welsh Labour government at every welsh election since 1999. Leftism permeates our society in many ways, not all of it good. Actual socialism has been on the rise here too. The growth of anti-capitalist and anti-liberal (in the UK sense) sentiment is rife both here and in the US. The growth of the acceptance of totalitarian ideas is concerning.

I'm not apologizing, I'm just properly contextualizing it next to generations of black communities subject to violence and severe economic repression, which you aren't, for reasons which seem fairly obvious - you think they are somehow equivalent, or that "law and order" in this context is more important than systemic racism and violence. Makes your values clear at least.

Malcolm wrote:
This assumes that wages are always "good."

For example, after NAFTA was passed, and the US dumped cheap corn on the Mexican Market, 50,000 small farmers were forced out of business. They were forced to leave their land and move to the cities to find jobs. Where they had formerly been self-reliant, and had minimal needs from the cash economy, now they were unable to provide for themselves, and abandoned maize cultivation to find work in Mexico City, etc. This led to massive overcrowding as well as a huge influx of men looking for work in the US, "illegally." Eventually, by working in the US, these small farmers were able to send money home and did a great deal to restore the local economies of Mexico. But the small farms in the meantime are finished, and along with them, many hundreds of landraces of maize. Now of course, the appetite for avocado toast has led to the rise of two things: illegal avocado cartels and destruction of monarch butterfly habitats in the old growth forests of Michoacán, which is the only state in Mexico allowed to export avocados to the US.

Once again, we see here how capitalism, far from encouraging free markets, actually is a force of market suppression. Amazon is a perfect example of what happens when antitrust laws are not observed. Amazon and Walmart are two of the main forces of market suppression in the world.

Marcia Rigg’s first thought when she watched that video of a white police officer kneeling on George Floyd’s neck while he cried out, ‘I can’t breathe’, was of her late brother Sean Rigg.

There were immediate parallels.

Firstly, both men were black, Sean was 40 and George Floyd, 46. In 2008, Sean also died after being restrained by police officers in the prone position – face down with pressure applied to the back and neck – for seven minutes. Though an Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) report said officers acted ‘reasonably and proportionately’, two years later, a Coroner’s court determined that they used ‘unnecessary’ and ‘unsuitable force’, which ‘more than minimally’ contributed to the curtailing of his life. Sean’s death was recorded as a cardiac arrest, with the coroners also adding in partial positional asphyxia.

A big part of the anger is because there are no pithy remedies. A being in hell takes eons to escape because the improvements are only incremental.

But patience is in short supply in the face of such inequality and injustice, especially in a place like the US where the inequality is flaunted and explicitly built on exploitation and cruelty. That's what Chauvin's smug face spoke in that video. He had no fear of consequences no matter what happened.

Even if we implemented all of those reforms in Malcolm's video to fix institutional racism, they would need to be energetically sustained for generations to have the effect we need. But we have to start where we are and all we can look forward to is fixing them.

"When the $600-a-week unemployment insurance runs out at the end of July, most people expect tremendous displacement risk," says Andrew Jakabovics with the affordable housing nonprofit Enterprise Community Partners. "Evictions are likely to go through the roof."
And with eviction moratoriums expiring in parts of the country, he says action is needed right away to help people who can't pay the rent as the pandemic drags on.

Meanwhile, as with many other aspects of the coronavirus outbreak, there are disparities along socioeconomic and racial lines. Panameño says her group did a national survey to see who was having trouble paying their bills after the pandemic struck.

"Twenty-five percent of Latinos had already fallen behind with their payments," she says. "Twenty-eight percent of African Americans had fallen behind. That compares to 12% of whites that had fallen behind."

Having been a Communist for 10 years im quite familiar with all of the different flavours. Any system which seeks to supplant capitalism will have to use force and violence, since individuals are not just going to hand over their property. You will also have to stop people like me from coming to power and privatising again. I read your eco-anarchist link last night. None of that can be achieved without force.

Specifically, modern Capitalism is an Anglo-American development, which again, was cultivated in the soil of white supremacy, slavery, exploitation, and genocide.
Slavery and colonialism had its part to play in how we ended up with capitalism today, although its not the whole story. However, as I said, without force if people are left alone to freely associate and trade then eventually it will develop. Its merely an extension of market trading after all. If the conditions were better and he caught on to the idea, Anathapindika could have become a fine capitalist being the rich banker that he was.

Malcolm wrote:
But you cannot give a single instance where capitalism established itself without force. Without force and the threat of violence, capital markets of the kind which characterize modern capitalism cannot function at all, especially if people are “left to themselves.” Modern capitalism functions through the suppression of markets, not through a so-called “free market.” For example, Monsanto.

It may surprise you to learn that I have indeed read Hayek, and I agree with his thesis that the central planning which characterizes certain kinds of authoritarian socialism is inefficient. I disagree with the conclusion that many people draw from this, however, capitalism is the only alternative or even most desirable alternative to such an undesirable economic system, since it clearly isn’t, given that its history is just as bloody, ecologically harmful, and nonvirtuous as political systems grounded in the pseudoscience of dialectical materialism.

WASHINGTON — President Trump on Wednesday first denied and then acknowledged that he had gone to a secure bunker in the White House  as protesters  demonstrated nearby but said he went there for an “inspection,” not because of concerns over his safety.

“Well, it was a false report,” Mr. Trump said during an interview with Brian Kilmeade of Fox News Radio, who had asked if he had been brought to the bunker along with his family as protests continued.

But then Mr. Trump reversed himself, and said he had gone to the bunker. But did not say when he went or with whom. “I wasn’t down — I went down during the day, and I was there for a tiny little short period of time, and it was much more for an inspection, there was no problem during the day.”

Mr. Trump added that he had be there “two, two and a half” times before because he had “done different things” related to inspecting the bunker.

The president’s account was contradicted by a person with firsthand knowledge who told The New York Times in a report published Sunday that on Friday night, Secret Service agents nervous for his safety abruptly rushed him to an underground bunker used in the past during terrorist attacks.

A second official familiar with the events said the agents acted after the White House’s security status was changed to “red” amid the protests, a warning of a heightened threat. Officials said the president was never really in danger, but that he and his family were rattled by the sometimes violent protests near the White House.

[T]he Geneva Convention bans the use of tear gas from war. Why is that not mandated for civilians?

It really goes back to the Chemical Weapons Convention. At the time when it was negotiated in the 1990s, there was a lot of pressure to ban chemical weapons and they were used by law enforcement. That obviously got pushback from many countries who said, "Well, we can't really give up this weapon because if we don't use tear gas we will have to resort to more lethal weapons." The compromise that was reached was to leave that option open for using tear gas or riot control agents in law enforcement and only in law enforcement.

One of the longest-running questions about this pandemic is a simple one: where did it come from? How did a virus that had seemingly never infected a human before make a sudden appearance in our species, equipped with what it needed to sweep from China through the globe in a matter of months?

Analysis of the virus's genome was ambiguous. Some analyses placed its origin within the local bat population. Others highlighted similarities to pangolins, which might have been brought to the area by the wildlife trade. Less evidence-based ideas included an escape from a research lab or a misplaced bioweapon. Now, a US-based research team has done a detailed analysis of a large collection of viral genomes, and it finds that evolution pieced together the virus from multiple parts—most from bats, but with a key contribution from pangolins.

Not that it would ever be an issue. Where I live I am more likely to be hit by lightning and orders of magnitude more likely to be killed by a cow. You don't seem to understand what police are for. In that situation to have an officer arrive 20 minutes too late with a pencil and notebook would not be particularly helpful.

Police were not designed to protect the public. They were designed to protect property. It is obvious from their actions that their main job is to protect capitalism. I didn't see many Wall Street criminals go to jail now or in 2008 did you? But black men go to jail for such crimes as standing on the street or not having money. Police brutality is inherent in capitalism and capitalism cannot exist without violence.

To quote black activist Boots Riley; "You cannot have full employment under Capitalism.

Capitalism must have a certain percentage of unemployed ppl to exist.

When unemployment rates lower past a certain point- u see WSJournal, FTimes, etc worry because it means that wages go up- &stock values go down- in real time
There must be an army of unemployed workers so that bosses can keep wages low by threatening workers with the idea of being replaced. The bigger that army is- the workers supposed "competition"- the lower the wages are.

And the point is to keep wages as low as they can
f there was full employment, workers could tell the boss "I want $75 an hour or I'm out" and the boss couldnt replace them.  Theyd have to give in to demands of workers without much organizing needed

Businesses must make more money each year than the last- so this wouldnt work.
So, Capitalism needs an army of unemployed workers in order to exist.

What do you call an army of unemployed workers?

You call them hungry. They need to eat.

And they don't have a job, because Capitalism needs them to be unemployed and desperate.
That army of unemployed workers isn't going to just let themselves or their families starve and be homeless.

They are going to go into illegal business.
Hell- even many folks with legal jobs that don't pay enough will need to do this for supplemental income.
ll business- legal and illegal- uses violence to regulate itself

illegal business doesn't have the police or the courts on to regulate it like legal business does.

"This block is only zoned for one cocaine vendor, if this guy wants to vend cocaine in the same area, he's gonna have to get a special permit. That is, unless he can agree to stick to vending heroin."
So illegal business practitioners have to regulate business themselves. As you see with police and legal business- regulating business takes physical force and violence. You can't have business without violence.
You can't have business w/o violence, and
you can't have unemployment w/o illegal business, and
you can't have capitalism without unemployment.

Therefore, you can't have capitalism without poverty, unemployment, so-called "crime", and violence.
But- how does the ruling class tell the whole working class- who, in the US, is largely White- that their poverty and low wages is something that is built into the economic system? That the wealth of the Bezoses and Bloombergs of the world RELY on their poverty?

They don't.
They teach the working class- thru media conglomerates they own (news & entertainment)- that low wages, poverty, and violence that grows out of that is is due to the bad decisions of the impoverished.

That the poverty they experience is something that can be fixed by unlearning

(the Bezoses and Bloombergs of the world don't have to personally edit or produce it to put this out- they just hire the editors and writers who don't challenge this view. Not hard- many of them come from similar backgrounds and/or training/education and therefore political view)
But how do the GET AWAY with telling the WHOLE working class that their low wages and poverty is built in to capitalism- without the working class deciding to get rid of the ruling class?

They don't.
They point to Black people and other people of color and say to the white working class: "look at those savages.  Theyre violent, their culture is lacking what they need to thrive in this system, they don't work hard, they have a weaker family structure than white ppl, etc etc"
"that is poverty- and Black people and other POC are in poverty because of their own doing, when in actuality capitalism works fine and is where you can get RICH if you do it right"

"here watch CSI:frak, it'll prove it to you"
They bolster the lie: "Black neighborhoods have more crime and violence than White neighborhoods"

Only if u lump the Bel Airs in w White working class

Studies show: if u compare Black communities to white communities of the SAME INCOME LEVEL,
crime & violence levels r the same
And that way they get the white working class to say "I'm not like them at all- I'm morally upstanding. If I do have some financial problems, it's cause of the couple little adjustments I need to make. Not the economic system. At least I'm not them."
and that's when you get white ppl in families who make $22k a year calling themselves MIDDLE CLASS and aligning themselves w the ruling class.

And this is not just Trump supporters. Look at Elon Musk's twitter and you'll find a gang of ppl kissing his ass, many w very little $
But now that poverty and the "crime" and violence that comes from it has been defined as a personal problem,

and furthermore- racistly defined as one derived from the culture of the community that it is supposedly happening in more-
If police are supposed to actually want to "fight crime", then they would go to the source of the "crime". This would be the ruling class. This would be the billionaires who cause the low wages and poverty and "crime" that, as I show above, is necessitated by their actions.
We've seen enough CSI:frak to know that they are always supposedly going for the guy at the top. the guy that is the ringleader of said crime.

If cops were in it to stop "crime" and the violence that comes from it, they wldn't be cops, they would be revolutionary organizers
Because the source of the crime isn’t in the Black communities other POC communities, or even White working class communities- the source of the crime is on 5th ave, in Bel Air, and silicon valley.
But, since the racist ideas about Black people and other POC- as I laid out above- are necessitated by capitalism, the job of the police in the Black community is functionally one of a combatant against the community.
It doesn’t matter, how nice the cop is in their personal life, or what basketball team they coach on the weekend, or even what their conscious intentions are-
the job of police is simply- at best- to lock up folks for being involved in their own survival in an economic system that dictates- and thrives off the fact- they are in poverty.
And their ARE other crimes that aren’t directly to do with a direct crime of economic survival, but even many of those are the outgrowth of the culture that comes from whatever the local industry is. Fishing villages sing fishing songs.
The only way for cops to feel like they are doing the right thing- the only way for them to function in their job- is for them to subscribe to racist notions of violence, crime, and poverty- even if the cop themselves is Black or POC.
If want to stop these things, we have to get rid of capitalism.

A mvmnt that understands that also understands where our power lies."

As far as a woman being shot in Little  Village, I am failing to find any news story of this. There was a women shot in this place on March 25th, who died a few days later, and a pregnant women was murdered there last May, but as far as I can tell this is not an accurate report.

Hello Sakya peeps

Can anybody report on what they have been told about Dorje Legpa? In particular, do your teachers regard him as a Oath-bound, worldly deity, or as an enlightened protector? I'm informally polling different schools' views on the matter.

many thanks!

Institutionalized Racism: A Syllabus

How can we help students understand George Floyd’s death in the context of institutionalized racism?

The United States has seen escalating protests over the past week, following the death of George Floyd while in custody of the Minneapolis police. Educators everywhere are asking how can we help students understand that this was not an isolated, tragic incident perpetrated by a few bad individuals, but part of a broader pattern of institutionalized racism. Institutional racism—a term coined by Stokely Carmichael (later known as Kwame Ture) and Charles V. Hamilton in their 1967 book Black Power: The Politics of Liberation in America—is what connects George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery with Philando Castile, Eric Garner, Emmett Till, and the thousands of other people of color who have been killed because they were black in America.

This context seems vital for discussions both inside and outside the classroom. The following articles, published over the course of JSTOR Daily’s five years try to provide such context. We will be updating this page with more stories and are working to acquire a reading list about institutionalized racism in the near future. (Note: Some readers may find some of the stories in this syllabus or the photos used to illustrate them disturbing. Teachers may wish to use caution in assigning them to students.)

Years ago i heard a Tibetan Buddhist speak and he told about when the Chinese invaded Tibet. He had tears in his eyes telling about his own Father, who got a gun and was shooting and killing the Chinese. With tears, he said "My Father probably went to Hell for this." We prayed for him and all the rituals, but killing and violence like this, is just wrong, even under the circumstances.

Malcolm wrote:
I have two gurus, both pretty famous. Both of them were freedom fighters who were imprisoned by the Chinese for many years. One of them used to write a wrathful syllable on his bullets in order to deliver the consciousness of his targets into the dharmadhātu. I had another guru, also pretty famous, he ran away. To be, they are all buddhas.

a little one sided to me, what you guys are presenting, like the protests are all peaceful and all the cops are violent, that is just not accurate or truthful.



Malcolm wrote:
All of the violence in the past several days has been initiated by the police shooting tear gas, rubber bullets, pepper rounds, and using pepper spray on peaceful, nonviolent protestors. The looters are not protestors, as mentioned above.

You see, where I live, a mostly white rural community in Western MA, the police are peace officers (just to be clear, I did not always live here, I lived for many years in the Boston area, where there were lots of different people). But the police in many urban areas often behave like they are a part of an occupying army (think Boston, NYC, etc.). Most of them do not live in the areas they patrol. They do not know the people they are supposed to be serving. The police have been increasingly militarized over the past thirty years and more. When there are peaceful protests, they show up in APC's, wearing heavy armor and weapons to face off against unarmed protestors, and regularly use excessive force. They act like forces of repression in these instances because they are being used as forces of repression. They are not protecting me. They are not protecting you. They are not protecting the protestors. They are violating people's civil rights.

There are also police who have done the right thing, like in Camden NJ, where the police joined the marchers, and other places, where they have taken a knee, or otherwise, showed their support for the protestors.
