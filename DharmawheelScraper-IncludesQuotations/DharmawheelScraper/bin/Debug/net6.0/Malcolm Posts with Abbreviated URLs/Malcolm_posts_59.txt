None. My point is that it's overly reductive to define the goal of the Buddhist path solely in terms of the ending of birth. If that were the case, a rock would also have met the (single) criterion; it was never born to begin with.

The way I see it -- and I realize this likely reflects lack of understanding on my part -- the goal of the Buddhist path is nirvana, and what brings about nirvana is the ending of ignorance. The ending of samsaric birth is a concomitant result; we are reborn into samsara as a result of ignorance, so when ignorance is overcome, the rebirth cycle stops.

It's a question of putting things in the right sequence.

Malcolm wrote:
You have to put in the Buddha's perspective — what is samsara? Rebirth. What causes rebirth? Ignorance. What ends ignorance? Awakening. What is the result of awakening? Nirvana. What is nirvana? The end of samsara. What is the end of samsara? The end of rebirth.
When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, & attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past lives. I recollected my manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two... five, ten... fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand, many eons of cosmic contraction, many eons of cosmic expansion, many eons of cosmic contraction & expansion: 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure & pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure & pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes & details.

"This was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed; light arose — as happens in one who is heedful, ardent, & resolute.

"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, & attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away & reappearance of beings. I saw — by means of the divine eye, purified & surpassing the human — beings passing away & re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior & superior, beautiful & ugly, fortunate & unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings — who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech & mind, who reviled the Noble Ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views — with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings — who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, & mind, who did not revile the Noble Ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views — with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus — by means of the divine eye, purified & surpassing the human — I saw beings passing away & re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior & superior, beautiful & ugly, fortunate & unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.

"This was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed; light arose — as happens in one who is heedful, ardent, & resolute.

"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, & attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations. I discerned, as it had come to be, that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are fermentations... This is the origination of fermentations... This is the cessation of fermentations... This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' My heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, was released from the fermentation of sensuality, released from the fermentation of becoming, released from the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there was the knowledge, 'Released.' I discerned that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'

"This was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed; light arose — as happens in one who is heedful, ardent, & resolute.

We all have a number of choices available: faith in Jesus, faith in Mohammed, faith in Buddha. There has to be some reason for making the choice, otherwise faith rests on an unstable foundation. Because there's always the possibility that one's faith might have been misplaced. After all, there are devout Christians and devout Musilms, though from a Buddhist standpoint they are wrong. From their standpoint Buddhists are wrong. How can we know? And the stakes are higher in monotheism: a Christian might end up in the Buddhist hells due to wrong view, but not permanently.

My argument would be that the Dharma does offer a reasonable basis, because what the Buddha said about dukkha and its causes can be verified empirically. So we proceed from there.

Malcolm wrote:
No, actually we cannot "empirically" verify the of the cause of dukha, because dukkha is caused by karma, and karma itself is caused by affliction. There is no dukkha that is not caused by karma. There are no means by which dukkha may be measured. Liberation itself is defined as freedom from affliction, and that too cannot be measured, so there is nothing at all "empirically verifiable" in Buddhadharma. The idea that there is, is a hangover from an earlier period of Western perceptions of Buddhism.

You might argue, Buddha said that the cause of dukkha is clinging, but here clinging itself is just affliction which gives rise to an action that results in suffering. If you restrict yourself to a one lifetime model, there is no reason to select Buddhadharma over a secular twelve steps program...

Empirical verification depends on the observable quantification of a data set. No one has ever empirically verified that Buddhadharma

I don't know.

All forms of Buddhism, as far as I know, stress the importance of trusting the Buddha. There are even some suttas which say, essentially, that trust and affinity for the Buddha can lead to stream entry even if one hasn't perfected sila. So I'm not denying its importance.

I'm just saying that since established faiths already exist in the West, faith may not be the most likely entry point into the Dharma. After all, if you already have that capability, why not just go to church? Logistically it's a lot easier -- there are plenty of churches everywhere but Buddhist centers or temples can be hard to find. I recall even the Dalai Lama has said that the locally established religion should be a good choice for most people.

So the appeal of the Dharma to (some) Westerners must in many cases be due to some other, distinctive qualities -- not the faith aspect specifically, since that can be found elsewhere.

However, if [the causes and conditions] are not perfect, a body will not be appropriated. If one should ask that sentient beings does not possess the conditions, it is as follows. Though a man and a woman have the mental factor of desire, and the intermediate state aggregate is present and seeking a womb, should that male and female have sexual intercourse too soon or too late or not have intercourse at that one time; or should there be some diseases in the body of either [the male or the female], there will be no ‘entry into the womb’.

Dave, what the Buddha is criticizing is the following:

daverupa said:
When I ask them this, they affirm it. Then I say to them: ‘In such a case, it is due to past deeds that you might destroy life, take what is not given, indulge in sexual activity, speak falsehood, utter divisive speech, speak harshly, indulge in idle chatter; that you might be full of longing, have a mind of ill will, and hold wrong view.’

Malcolm wrote:
This a kind of determinism, and is not what we are talking about. What we are talking about is that fact that the painful sensations that ripen on the body are result of negative deeds in the past, etc. You can consult the Koshabhaśyam where Vasubandhu states "the essential element of vipaka is sensation...A sensation, the result of retribution of a bad action, is painful." In fact, Vasubandhu goes on to say that mental suffering is not actually a karmic ripening, per say, but arises from the physical ripening of karma on the body such that it produces a state which gives rise to mental suffering.

Rather than making wild and inappropriate accusations about how the Tibetan Buddhist understanding of karma differs from "the early material", have the humility to admit that you know very little about anything concerning Tibetan Buddhism and that you are not very interested to learn. The fact is that such things as the antarabhāva and so forth are grounded in sutras in the Agamas, making it just as "early", to invoke your favored interpretive fetish, as any thing in the Pali Canon.

It might be illuminating for Malcolm or others who have had extensive contact with Tibetan or other Buddhist cultures to tell us what they have observed in terms of attitudes towards the disabled, to what extent those attitudes are informed by belief in karma-vipaka, and to what extent Buddhists are or are not helping to promote acceptance, tolerance and equal rights.

Malcolm wrote:
I have never observed anything but kindness towards disabled people, have never heard any talk about their being "at fault" for their disability. On the other hand, I have heard many Tibetans describe their own suffering in this life as a result of their own misdeeds in past lives, quite cheerfully and without any rancor.

Hell, even the Tibetan penal system in Lhasa took karma into account, assuming that in many cases it was pointless to administer a punishment for this or that crime, because the criminal was going to suffer in future lives for crimes committed in this life. This attitude lent itself to rather lenient treatments of many kinds of crimes. See Rebecca French's book on Tibetan law and jurisprudence.

I think that part of the issue is that people raised in western cultures spend of a lot of time dealing with issues of "guilt", and spend a lot of time trying to avoid feelings of guilt.

"Here, student, some woman or man is one who harms beings with his hands or with clods or with sticks or with knives. Due to having performed and completed such kammas, on the dissolution of the body, after death, he reappears in a state of deprivation...

For me karma is a word for cause and effect, nothing more, nothing less.

Disease or developmental disabilities do not have some misdeed from a previous life as their cause, the cause is in most cases just a genetic or developmental defect, or just bad luck (although there are conditions like lung cancer or obesity which can be caused by the actions of the patient). To link all ailments with some kind of "sin" is toxic and irrational. I wish Buddhism would be rid of it.

Malcolm wrote:
The words for cause and effect are hetu and phala.

Vipaka however is a very specific find of effect of a very specific kind of cause, namely "karma", which is in fact a positive, negative and neutral volition with corresponding positive, negative and neutral results (vipaka) in this life or some future lifetime which does not dissipate until it meets its cause for ripening, or someone attains liberation, whichever comes first.

If Buddhism were to jettison the teachings of the Buddha because someone finds this or that teaching of the Buddhas uncomfortable, dissatisfactory or not to their liking, it would no longer be "Buddhism" but would become something else instead.

There are many such teachings where the Buddha indicates that karma is involved in directly involved in illnesses, some we would term "genetic" illnesses. The Buddha continues:
In that respect, if it is asked what are the karmas resulting in many illnesses, there are ten factors that result in many illnesses: striking out with fists and palms etc.; believing it is proper to strike out with fists, palms, etc.; praising striking out with fists and palms, etc.; inflicting pain on one's father or mother; inflicting pain on an ārya; being happy when an enemy is afflicted with illness; being unhappy when an enemy recovers from an illness; giving what is beneficial [lit. medicinal], eating food without permission to eat. Those ten factors result in many illnesses, this karma results in many illnesses.
Therefore, we can see from this that martial artists should be very careful.

Actually, the Buddha argued that it is well known by the world that there are simply biological causes for some things.

It is an incorrect view to hold everything to be the result of karma. Only in a round about metaphorical way can you say everything is a result of karma. Now we don't rely upon theories of bile, but the principle of a biological (non-intentional) cause for diseases is the same.
Sivaka Sutta said:
There are cases where some feelings arise based on bile [i.e., diseases and pains that come from a malfunction of the gall bladder]. You yourself should know how some feelings arise based on bile. Even the world is agreed on how some feelings arise based on bile. So any brahmans & contemplatives who are of the doctrine & view that whatever an individual feels — pleasure, pain, neither-pleasure-nor-pain — is entirely caused by what was done before — slip past what they themselves know, slip past what is agreed on by the world. Therefore I say that those brahmans & contemplatives are wrong. ...

But then again, it may be more satisfying to just stick to our soapboxes...

Malcolm wrote:
First we have to decide whether abortion is himsa or ahimsa. Abortion can hardly be called ahimsa, can it? In fact abortion is the deliberate harming of one sentient being by another, in this case the harming of a child by its mother.

Every sentient is deserving of the same level of compassion no matter what they have done or what class of sentient being they are.

On the other hand, Mahāyāna ethics are more important than rigid adherence to the letter of a vow. But to undertake an action on the basis of Mahāyāna ethics, self-interest has to be absolutely absent from one's thinking.

Because abortion is himsa, harming a sentient being, it cannot be condoned by those who follow Buddhadharma in general. On the other hand, there are always special cases where there may be greater harm in prohibiting an abortion than permitting one, such as examples of severe birth defects, threat to the life of the mother and so on, impregnation through rape, incest, and so on.

So, in general, the position of Buddhadharma is that abortion is harming another sentient being as well as taking life. In general it is not only a serious breach of pratimokṣa vows to have an abortion or to encourage someone to have an abortion (and in the case of monk, results in a defeat), but it is also serious bodhisattva downfall to either have an abortion or to encourage someone to have an abortion apart from special instances.

On the other hand, there is the political fact of separation of church and state, which is necessary in any functional so-called "democracy". Though as a follower of Buddhadharma, I am personally opposed to abortion, I am also opposed to legislating religious doctrines into law. So it is something I leave to the courts and legislature to decide as a matter of social policy.

And finally, just because we followers of Buddhadharma are opposed to abortion in a general way does not mean we should adopt the angry and confrontational rhetoric of the "pro-life" movement. We should have compassion for everyone, since that's what we Mahayanis aim to do, i.e have impartial compassion for all sentient beings.

As I recall the great spat between yourself and several Zen teachers at E-Sangha came about initially due to their position on non-permanent nirvana, on nirvana as an extreme, are you now upholding the view you were previously fighting against? Or have I misunderstood?

Malcolm wrote:
You misunderstood. They were talking about a temporary nirvana.

And that is not what the argument was about, actually. The argument was "are Zen priests the equivalent of bhikṣus?" The reason is that Zen priests seem to feel they are entitled to all the privileges and recognitions to which a bhikṣu is entitled. My point of view was and is that they are lay bodhisattvas.

However, the interesting point of why Sariputra is the butt of the joke here is actually based on a misapprehension, and this is the misunderstanding that Sariputra was the author of the Abhidharma, in which the Heart Sutra is clearly critiquing. Of course the Abhidharma was a later addition and not reflective of the early suttas and at times quite at odds with them (dharmas having substantial existence, etc). So this again is an example how prejudices can become reinforced over time and then become as if fact, based on misapprehensions.

Malcolm wrote:
In the Sarvastivāda, the dominant intellectual tradition in Indian Buddhism, Śariputra is indeed the author of some of the seven seminal Abhidharma texts.

Again, in the Mahāyāna sūtrsa, the Buddha indicates that he did not teach everything fully, not that what he taught in those śrāvaka sutras was false.

TRC said:
As you correctly point out LastLegend, “of course Sariputra understood”, there is no doubt. However, others studying the Heart Sutra obviously read this misunderstanding into it, as we can see here by Malcolm’s response.

Malcolm wrote:
Are you familiar with the Vimalakirti Nirdeśa sūtra? If so, you should be really offended, since you seem to enjoy taking offense at Mahāyāna.

TRC said:
While we are on the subject of the heart Sutra, who is considered to be the author?

Malcolm wrote:
Why, the Buddha, of course. It is through his entering samadhi that Avalokiteśvara was empowered to speak on his behalf.

TRC said:
Also, I’m still waiting a sound rebuttal explaining how the Kaccayanagotta Sutta is not directly pointing to the emptiness of all phenomena, that practitioners of early Buddhism aren’t supposed to be able to realise.

Malcolm wrote:
It is a teaching on dependent origination, not directly about emptiness. And since the dependent origination being discussed is the dependent origination of a person's continuum, explicitly it only concerns the selflessness of persons and not the selflessness of phenomena. It primarily concerns the notion of the permanence or annihilation of the self, two extremes the world is addicted to. This is why the preface to the famous passage states:
By & large, Kaccayana, this world is in bondage to attachments, clingings (sustenances), & biases. But one such as this does not get involved with or cling to these attachments, clingings, fixations of awareness, biases, or obsessions; nor is he resolved on 'my self.' He has no uncertainty or doubt that just stress, when arising, is arising; stress, when passing away, is passing away. In this, his knowledge is independent of others. It's to this extent, Kaccayana, that there is right view.
In fact the passage is cited by Nāgārjuna in the chapter 15 of the MMK, his take down of Sarvastivāda substantialism, the notion that underneath appearances there is a prakriti, an unchanging nature which never changes, leading to the doctrine that all effects exist in their causes because of their misunderstanding of the Buddha's statement "everything exists in the three times."

The idea that this passage points to the heart of Madhyamaka is an idea advanced primarily by David Kalupahana. But we have very good reason to disregard Kalupahana's understanding because he completely disregarded Buddhapalita and Candarakirti's identification of which passages were stated by the opponent and which passages were to be considered Nāgārjuna's.

This passage is cited by Nāgārjuna because it cannot be rejected by his śrāvaka opponents, not because it is an end all be all statement that is the heart of Madhyamaka. There are many more salient passages in Mahāyāna sūtras which are much more explicit than this passage detailing the "middle way." He cites it because both schools hold it to be the Buddhavacana, and that is all.

In my opinion, your view of the the śravaka canon has been completely influenced by Madhyamaka [this is very common these days, since the Pali commentarial literature totally lacks any discussions of profound emptiness]. It is a pity you don't recognize that your own understanding of the śrāvaka canon actually comes from Mahāyāna.

Still perpetuating the myth I see. Firstly though, you still have not addressed the quote from the Heart Sutra that refers specifically to the aggregates and consequently the falsehood it depicts of an arahant’s realisation. Secondly, as has already been quoted by a more balanced Mahayana practitioner in this thread, it is quite evident that emptiness of all phenomena is penetrated and understood in the early discourses. In fact it goes to heart of the Madhyamika view, that of the middle way between existence and non-existence.

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddha's teachings are one thing, what śrāvakas realize is another.

TRC said:
So here it is again:

"By & large, Kaccayana, this world is supported by (takes as its object) a polarity, that of existence & non-existence. But when one sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment, 'non-existence' with reference to the world does not occur to one. When one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment, 'existence' with reference to the world does not occur to one.”


See, this is pointing directly to all phenomena (“the world”) as empty. It’s extremely explicit, it doesn’t come more direct!

Malcolm wrote:
This was addressed already by a previous citation of the Buddha:
Mahāmati, also others rouse a mind that wishes for nirvana having perceived that all things depend on a cause. However, Mahāmati, because they do not perceive the selflessness in phenomena [for them] there is no freedom.

TRC said:
And here is the Buddha now pointing directly to his doctrine (not Nagarjuna’s – his MMK was a commentary on the Buddha’s already established understanding of emptiness) on which he’s realisation of the middle way is founded on, which is of course no less than dependent arising.

Malcolm wrote:
No one is questioning the Buddha's realization.

TRC said:
So from the same discourse we have:
"'Everything exists': That is one extreme. 'Everything doesn't exist': That is a second extreme. Avoiding these two extremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma via the middle: From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications. From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness. From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&-form. From name-&-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media. From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact. From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling …”

Now you mention the Prajñāpāramitas. It seems to me, at least from my reading of the Heart Sutra, that it has a very fundamental and gross misinterpretation and misrepresentation of the awakening of the arahant. That is, it is evident that Avalokiteśvara proceeds to lecture Sariputra on the emptiness of the aggregates.

Malcolm wrote:
I assume you are referring to the various statements in Mahayāna that śrāvakas do not realize emptiness of phenomena. Indeed, the Buddha states in the Lankāvatara sūtra:
Mahāmati, also others rouse a mind that wishes for nirvana having perceived that all things depend on a cause. However, Mahāmati, because they do not perceive the selflessness in phenomena [for them] there is no freedom.
And:
Mahāmati, because liberation has a single taste, the abandonment of the obscuration of affliction of pratyekabuddhas and śrāvakas might not be a difference, but they do not abandon the knowledge obscuration. The knowledge obscuration is purified through the difference of seeing the selflessness in phenomena.
Now then, on the other hand, the Buddha is not at fault here, because as Candrakirti famously states in his auto-commentary on the Madhyamakāvatara:
Someone might think, "If the selflessness of phenomena is taught in śrāvakayāna, the teaching of Mahāyāna would be pointless." That line of thought should be understood to contradict reason and citation. The selflessness in phenomena is not the only Mahāyana teaching. If it is asked why, there are the bodhisattva stages, the perfections, aspirations, great compassion and so on, as well complete dedication, the two accumulations and the dharmatā of inconceivability, As it is said in the Ratnavali:

The aspirations of bodhicitta
and the total dedication of practice
is not explained in the śrāvakayāna, 
so where will bodhisattvas [be explained]?
The topic of the bodhisattva practice
are not explained in [their] sūtras, 
but are explained in the Mahāyāna sūtras.
Therefore, they are upheld by the wise.

In order to clarify the selflessness of phenomena it is also reasonable that it is a teaching of Mahāyāna because it is held that it is extensively explained. The selflessness of phenomena is only briefly indicated in the śravakayāna. As the Ācarya said:

You have said that there is no freedom
without realizing signlessness;
therefore, you have taught that fully
in the Mahāyāna.
One can object, "But Candra says the selflessness in phenomena is taught the śrāvaka canon." Indeed he does say this, but I must point out that not even the names "selfness of persons" and selfless of phenomena" are ever heard in śrāvakayāna commentarial texts. Who has ever heard of something that can be understood without it being given a name? The fact that these two emptinesses are not identified in the commentarial literature of the śrāvaka canon is sufficient evidence to show that even the idea of two-fold emptiness is completely foreign to their understanding of Dharma. If they cannot even name it, how can they realize it? It is like assuming that someone will arrive at a destination they have never heard of, which is not on any map, and has no identifying features,and to which they have no intent to go — in short, even if they arrive in such a place they will not recognize it as a destination at all and will continue to move on since they are not looking for such a place to begin with.

So, the chapter actually tells us that on the one hand the Buddha eternally abides in no birth, that is the ultimate reality that can be seen by anyone who practises correctly. On the other hand, the longevity is the result of the merit from the bodhisattva cultivation that eventually expires. Or, the two sides actually stand for the same, that is, suchness as the Buddha's true nature.

Malcolm wrote:
What is nirvana actually? It is the cessation of afflictions that cause rebirth in the three realms.

Since the merit cultivated on the bodhisattva path is limitless, it effects will be limitless. Or are you saying there is some limit to objectless dedications and so on that is not mentioned in the sūtras.

In short, it is very clear that in Mahāyāna the nirvana enjoyed by the Buddha does not entail the absolute cessation of his continuum. Further, there are the five certainties of the Sambhogakāya, and in terms of the two rūpakāya, the Sambhogakāya is definitive, whereas the nirmanakāya shows up here and there like the illusion of an illusionist.

No question about that, that from one developed the other.

The Mahaprajnaparamitasastra says that once a bodhisattva attained irreversibility, he has a choice whether to stay with beings until the end or go for buddhahood. However, if buddhas were superior and could have also stayed with beings, then choosing to remain a bodhisattva is indeed pointless.

I have demonstrated nirvana,

I don't see how it is incorrect what the quote says. Can you find the term in a PP sutra or early Madhyamaka? Just did a quick search for it (無住涅槃) in the Great PP Sutra (大般若波羅蜜多經) and no match.

The term is mentioned in the Mahāyānaprasādaprabhāvana

The Āryaśālistambaka-mahāyānasūtraṭīkā by Nāgārjuna, preserved in the bstan 'gyur mentions it twice.

In any case, let us suppose that the technical term "non-abiding nirvana" is first found in the Maitreyan corpus. It is irrelevant that term is not found Madhyamaka since the treatises of Nagārjuna are almost wholly focused on faults concerning the view and at this time notion of the Buddha having achieved Buddhahood in the distant past. In the perfection of wisdom sutras and so on the idea of the dharmakāya manifesting an illusory form body to help sentient beings is fully present. For example the PP in 8000 lines states:
The Tathāgata is not seen in the rupakāya. The Tathāgata the dharmatākaya. Son of a good family, dharmatā does not come or go. Son of a good family, likewise, the Tathāgata does not arrive or leave. Son of a good family, for example, an illusionist's host of elephants, horses, chariots or infantry soldiers do not come or go. Son of a good family, in the same way the form of the Tathāgata does not come or go.
Such teachings as this are the basis for the term "non-abiding nirvana."

They do not spontaneously manifest — they manifest only with great effort, diligence and understanding. If they spontaneously manifested everyone would see them all the time and without any causes or condition and without any progression or order. But this does not happen, which is why the visions are laid in the order that they are.

Likewise, one only moves through the following progression, first one can see the nirmanakāya, then the sambhogakāya and in the end, dharmakāya -- this is the same whether one is a common Mahāyāna practitioner or a Dzogchen practitioner. The path of Dzogchen is not in reality something other than a Mahāyāna path. It is a Mahāyāna path practiced according to techniques and methods not shared with common Mahāyāna, and so therefore is part of secret mantra, as Dzogchen tantras proclaim again and again. There is no Dzogchen outside of Mahāyāna.

The of course there is the famous examples of Drogmi and Rwa. They both had set fees for teachings, this much for the empowerment, this much for the intimate instruction, this much for the sadhana explanation and so on. In Tibet, prior to the institutionalization of Vajrayāna lineages, the habits of gurus were to set fees. Don't you recall that Longchenpa was depressed he could not attend the Vima Nyinthig empowerment given by Kumararaja? So Kumararaja secretly gave him the empowerment fee so he could attend. The Dorje Gotrab root text specifies it should not be given to anyone who does not fork over gold. ChNN joked about this, when he first gave the lung for the whole text.

After Vajrayāna was institutionalized then it became common for teachings like the Nyingthig Yazhi, Lamdre and so on to be freely given. But even here, Kunzang Dechen Lingpa stated that while he was able to attend the Rinchen Terzod for free, he never received any instructions on the practices it contained because he could not afford to pay for them. So the perception that Dharma was free or sponsored in Tibet is somewhat true, and also somewhat false. It is more complicated then most people realize.

That's right, sravakas are important. If one can save oneself, that's already great. I think that those of us exposed to Mahayana teachings (sutra and tantra) can be a little fooled by the rhetoric about how superior the bodhisattvayana is. Although here I might add that the majority of popular Mahayana lineages don't emphasise the bodhisattva career, instead they promise buddhahood in this life or the next.

Malcolm wrote:
The purpose of becoming a buddha is to help others. The purpose of becoming an arhat is to help yourself. There is nothing wrong with the latter, but it cannot be compared with the former. Therefore, whether one attains buddhahoood in this life, the next left, or in three incalculable eons, the motivation of the bodhisattva path is infinitely superior to the motivation to become an arhat.

Further, the bodhisattva path is emphasized in Vajrayāna, without bodhisattva motivation is not possible to to attain buddhahood. Quite frankly, of all the Mahāyāna traditions out there today, Tibetan Buddhism emphasizes bodhicitta the most.

I don't seek to have the Mahayana view defended, but I do want it clearly stated.

The foundation isn't just Nikayas/Agamas, it's Agamas + certain other Mahayana texts that are the actual baseline foundation. The claim about Ni/Ag being the foundation snagged my mind a bit as it passed because saying that they are foundational is incomplete, and thus inaccurate: the practical foundation employed by Mahayana folk necessarily encompasses more than that (as does Theravada, but in quite different ways).

So, the picture I see emerging from this discussion is that the e.g. Agamas aren't foundational on their own, they are incorporated with other texts which then as a group comprise the practical Mahayana foundation. Thus, Early Buddhism forms part of the foundation for both, and other things make up the remainder of the textual mass in each case.

Malcolm wrote:
The whole edifice of the Buddha's teaching in the Agamas are the foundation for Mahāyāna. It does not mean that there are no teachings in the Agamas that are regarded as contextual/provisional, to be applied or not as the situation may warrant it. The same is the case with the relationship between Mahāyāna and Secret Mantra — the whole of Mahāyāna and the Agamas are the foundation upon which Secret Mantra rests, but this does not mean that there are no teachings in the Agamas and Vaipulya sūtras that are regarded as contextual/provisional to be applied or not as the situation may warrant it. For example, the 37 bodhipakṣadharmas, found in the Agamas and Vaipulya sūtras, are also found in Tantras. Mandalas are, from one point of view, little more than exercises in reciting various parts of Abhidharma in the form of deities.

One way to look at it is that the Agamas are the milk, the Vaipulya sūtras are the cream, and the Tantras are the butter.

When we examine the purpose of merit accumulation, we can ascertain the differences.

There are significant differences between how the bodhisattva path is understood by the Nikaya schools and how it is understood in Mahāyāna.

Devotionalism in Mahāyāna and the Śravaka schools is not a path, as it is Vajrayāna.

Bakmoon said:
I agree.

Malcolm wrote:
Mahāyāna bodhicitta simply does not exist in the Agamas, nor does the Mahāyāna path.

Bakmoon said:
That's true of the main body of the Four Nikayas for example, but the Bodhisattva path is talked about somewhat in the latter portions of the Khuddaka Nikaya in the Jatakas, Cariyapitika, and the Buddhavamsa, and it is talked about in more detail in the classical commentaries, both on these texts, and in several commentaries on the main Suttas such as in the commentary on the Samannaphala Sutta and the Ghatikara Sutta.

Bodhicitta isn't specifically identified under a single name and doctrine, but I think the concept is there in the commentaries. For example, Acarya Dhammapala in his commentary on the Cariyapitika writes:
The aspiration, made by one endowed with these eight factors, is in denotation the act of consciousness (cittuppaada) occurring together with the collection of these eight factors. Its characteristic is rightly resolving to attain the supreme enlightenment. Its function is to yearn, "Oh, may I awaken to the supreme perfect enlightenment, and bring well-being and happiness to all beings!" It is manifest as the root-cause for the requisites of enlightenment. Its proximate cause is great compassion, or the achievement of the necessary supporting conditions. Since it has as its object the inconceivable plane of the Buddhas and the welfare of the whole immeasurable world of beings, it should be seen as the loftiest, most sublime and exalted distinction of merit, endowed with immeasurable potency, the root-cause of all the qualities issuing in Buddhahood. Simultaneous with its arising, the Great Man enters upon the practice of the vehicle to great enlightenment (mahaabodhiyaanapa.tipatti). He becomes fixed in his destiny, irreversible, and therefore properly gains the designation "bodhisattva." His mind becomes fully devoted to the supreme enlightenment in its completeness, and his capacity to fulfill the training in the requisites of enlightenment becomes established. For when their aspiration succeeds, the Great Men correctly investigate all the paaramiis with their self-evolved knowledge which prefigures their future attainment of omniscience. Then they undertake their practice, and fulfill them in due order, as was done by the wise Sumedha when he made his great aspiration.

Like the aspiration, great compassion (mahaakaru.naa) and skillful means (upaayakosalla) are also conditions for the paaramiis. Therein, "skillful means" is the wisdom which transforms giving (and the other nine virtues) into requisites of enlightenment. Through their great compassion and skillful means, the Great Men devote themselves to working uninterruptedly for the welfare of others without any concern for their own happiness and without any fear of the extremely difficult course of conduct that great bodhisattvas must follow. And their nature is such that they are able to promote the welfare and happiness of beings even on occasions when they are merely seen, heard of, or recollected, (since even the sight, report, or thought of them) inspires confidence. Through his wisdom the bodhisattva perfects within himself the character of a Buddha, through his compassion the ability to perform the work of a Buddha. Through wisdom he brings himself across (the stream of becoming), through compassion he leads others across. Through wisdom he understands the suffering of others, through compassion he strives to alleviate their suffering. Through wisdom he becomes disenchanted with suffering, through compassion he accepts suffering. Through wisdom he aspires for nibbaana, through compassion he remains in the round of existence. Through compassion he enters sa.msaara, through wisdom he does not delight in it. Through wisdom he destroys all attachments, but because his wisdom is accompanied by compassion he never desists from activity that benefits others. Through compassion he shakes with sympathy for all, but because his compassion is accompanied by wisdom his mind is unattached. Through wisdom he is free from "I-making" and "mine-making," through compassion he is free from lethargy and depression.
There is also a passage from the Buddhavamsa which describes how the Buddha in his previous incarnation as Sumedha took the Bodhisattva vow, but I'll have to take some time to find the passage.

Malcolm wrote:
Such discussions also exist amongst the Sarvastivadins, for example the Abhidharmakosha discusses the career of the bodhisattva. But this is really not the same as the Buddha's teaching on the bodhisattva path in Mahāyāna. For one, the concept of an awakened bodhisattva is never found in any Theravada texts at all.

Not only that, but unlike the śravaka schools, in Mahāyāna there are specific rites to undertake bodhisattva vows and commitments to which one must adhere. In other words there is a Bodhisattva vinaya that is distinct from the śravaka vinaya and supercedes where the former contradicts the latter. It is probable that śravaka understanding the bodhisattva path was influenced by Mahāyāna sūtras.

Here's a quote from Douglas Duckworth I pulled from from the NIrvana wiki:
The Lesser Vehicle does not result in the practitioner becoming a complete buddha; rather, the aim is to achieve a personal nirvana that is the total extinction of existence. The Great Vehicle, however, does result in becoming a complete buddha. A buddha remains actively engaged in enlightened activity to liberate beings for as long as samsara remains. Thus, those who accomplish the Great Vehicle do not abide in samsara due to their wisdom that sees its empty, illusory nature. Further, unlike those who attain the nirvana of the Lesser Vehicle to escape samsara, they do not abide in an isolated nirvana due to their compassion. For these reasons, in the Great Vehicle, nirvana is said to be “unlocated” or “nonabiding” (apratiṣṭhita), staying in neither samsara nor nirvana.

The above covers the big differences as I understand them, which includes the central role of Bodhicitta in full enlightenment.

Fascinating.

Within Theravada, criticism is oft thrown at those who claim nibbana as a state outside of all existence.

Nonabiding Nirvana simply means that a Buddha never actually remains in the nirvana for ever, always acting on behalf of sentient beings.

No, but by becoming a Dzogchen practitioner one becomes a practitioner of Buddhadharma. There is no way around this. Dzogchen is Prajñāpāramita, etc. It is not Paramshiva, Brahman, etc.

Oh, sure, you can argue that the mind is not affected by any of the six realms, being inherently pure, but it is frankly stupid to claim that recognition of your state is realization. No Dzogchen tantra states that.

shes pa is jñāta, rnam shes is vijñāna, and yeshe is jñāna, perhaps best way to to understand this is that latter two are subsets of the first, as is clearly explained in the sgra thal gyur tantra.

rig pa (vidyā, vedana) is a function of shes pa.

One cannot state that rigpa in its unripened stated for example, is awakening. The whole reason that basis is called "the basis" is because it has yet to be realized, that is why it is called "the basis."
rigpa is knowledge of the basis, experientally. The rest is optional.

Malcolm wrote:
Rigpa is just a name for the mind — sometimes that mind knows its own state, sometimes it doesn't. When one has that kind of experience on is merely a practitioner on the path, slowly improving, applying one's understanding to the introduction.

Realization is when that knowledge is permanent and not fleeting, leading to the abandonment of the two obscurations.

What level of use/importance do the writings (not the transmissions) of those four Indian female authors carry? What I could gather with a brief search is that the actual founder of the Shangpa Kagyu was Khyungpo Naljor, a male monk, who studied with two of the four yoginis. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that this is all irrelevant, but it seems to me that women had no better situation in Tibet than anywhere else. And even if there were some Indian woman siddhas, in their society they were not recognised as anyone important.

Malcolm wrote:
You are confusing institutions with lineages.

The founder of a Vajrayāna lineage is not the Tibetan who collected some Indian teachings and started an institution, but the awakened master who had the capacity to directly communicate with Vajradhara and pass that transmission along. These four women had that capacity which is why they all stand at the heads of lineages of Vajrayāna transmission.

These four women, five when including Macig, were recognized as important in their own milieu, which is why we have their teachings and texts with us today, which are regularly cited and commented upon to the present day.

1. If Dzogchen necessarily includes teachings on the channels and such, does it mean that (a) public books on Dzogchen are actually sutra level teachings on emptiness and mindfulness, (b) whoever teaches/practises Dzogchen without deity yoga and/or togal only uses the name Great Perfection but not the real transmission, and (c) semde and longde, since they don't have togal as far as I'm aware, are not really Dzogchen or just preliminaries?

Malcolm wrote:
Some public books with the name Dzogchen in the title are just sutra level teachings on emptiness and mindfulness, but politeness restrains me from naming which ones.

Sems sde at minimum requires introduction through the so called empowerment of the potentiality of vidyā (of which there are 18 connected with the dohas of 18 ancient masters), and is part of the completion stage of Mahāyoga and Anuyoga — the bodhicitta texts do not actually give much detail on the method of practice, being mainly concerned with theory and view. So called sems sde is primarily about the basis. Because the basic texts of sems sde provide little information on how it is to be practiced, there are three different systems of Sems sde practice in Tibet, each with its own preliminaries. For example, the Nyan lugs systems of Sems sde requires the regular four uncommon foundations and so on.

Longde requires initiation into the system of Ngondzog Gyalpo, and is connected with that yidam.


Astus said:
3. If the teaching on the natural state is no different from the Prajnaparamita sutras - that is, you seem to agree to the unity of Dzogchen, Mahamudra and Madhyamaka in terms of the ultimate view - is it your understanding that Dzogchen is a unique way because of its togal instructions and nothing else?

Malcolm wrote:
There are a number of things which make Dzogchen distinct, thögal is one, but there are others, the explanation of the generic basis is another, the specific preliminary practices related to thögal such as 'khor 'das ru shan and so on are others, and the general requirement for some kind of introduction either through the fourth empowerment of Mahāyoga, the ati yoga empowerment found in Anuyoga or the empowerment of the potentiality of vidyā.

As far as tregchö goes, there is really no difference between tregchö, Kagyu Mahāmudra and the meditation the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana — all three have the same point and all three depend on the experiential view imparted during empowerment.

I also want to point out that like the rest of Vajrayāna, Dzogchen practice, path and realization completely depends on the Guru. Guru Yoga is absolutely central to Dzogchen. Without guru yoga and devotion to a realized master, no progress at all is possible in Dzogchen, none whatsoever.

there was an interesting post here for a few minutes that then got erased that was saying that it was not accidental, because of all the religions of this planet, only Buddhism had a basic perspective that was a fertile ground for Dzogchen to appear in.  It is a very interesting question if that is the case or if other religions or philosophies could have birthed the Dzogchen view, or did in fact give rise to similar understanding? For example, is Heidegger's seinsfrage a step towards Dzogchen in a western tradition? Are some of Meister Eckhart's late sermons expressing what amounts to a Dzogchen view? I don't think these are easy "yes" or "no" questions (although I expect an avalanche of "no"s any minute... )

In any case, the quotes from Namkahi Norbu are pretty clearly saying that one does not even have to be a "Buddhist" to practice Dzogchen, in which case the cultural phenomena called "Buddhism" becomes a kind of chrysalis from which Dzogchen emerges but is perhaps not needed once it does so. That is not to say that those still attached to the cultural forms have not fought, and do not fight, tooth and nail to stop the butterfly from emerging and leaving behind the casing...

Malcolm wrote:
The Dzogchen teachings are not something found outside of Buddhadharma for the simple reason that they are a Dharma that was taught by the Buddhas no amount of intellectual posturing can change this fact. Does this mean that someone has to sign up with a card that says "Registered Buddhist" like it is a political party? No, of course not.

These days a sort of intellectual "Dzogchen" is very fashionable — but it generally arises from a misconstrual of the Dzogchen tradition divorced from the matrix in which it emerged, the religious culture of Tibet from the 9th to the 12th century. During this four centuries, Dzogchen teachings were gradually promulgated in the context of Secret Mantra. One thing that ChNN also says is that there is no such a thing as "pure Dzogchen." What he means by this is that there is no practice of Dzogchen divorced from the rest of the Buddhist path (Bonpos are just  Buddhists with a differing historical narrartive regarding the origins of their teachings). He also states in very plain language that the result of Sūtra, Tantra and Dzogchen are the same — the same buddhahood. He never makes this claim with regard to Christianity, Hinduism, Taoism and so on. Of course another intellectual fashion of the current day is that imagine that somehow there are teachings equivalent to Dzogchen in schools outside of Buddhadharma. This assertion is laughable. Beyond this, Dzogchen texts themselves take great pains to site their own teachings within the horizon of Buddhadharma, and outside the horizon of the teachings of this and that tīrthika school.

The only thing radical about Dzogchen in the end is that a few people might have the capacity recognize their own stated and live in that knowledge 24/7 obviating the need for any further path — but those of us who did not recognize that state and entered into delusion must labor away at our two obscurations, even though, as it is clearly stated in the Prajñāpāramita that when we reach the final result we will realize that there was nothing to accomplish and nothing to remove all along. In the meantime however, we soldier on because while we are under the the power of karma and afflictions there is a basis of purification and a reason for purification. This is recognized also in Dzogchen teachings, thus the reason there are so many purifications practices, purification practices for body, speech, mind and so on. The entire first chapter of the Dimension of Sound (sgra thal 'gyur) tantra consists of nothing but purification practices, including creation stage and completion stage practices, and the entire first volume of Vimalamitra's commentary to this text consists of nothing more than elaborating all these practices in detail.

As to the notion that direct introduction is sufficient, this is a gross error of understanding. As the famed Semde master Zhigpo Dudtsi points out, the only chigcharwas (instantaneous realizers) he knew of were Saraha and Lingje Repa (neither of them even Dzogchen practitioners), but that while he had sought out some other examples, he did not know of any while not ruling out the possibility that they existed. But it seems these days everyone is a chigcharwas. Further, if you are not practicing the profound teaching of thögal, one has no way of working with pure vision apart from the two stages. It is for this reason then that Tregchö is always combined with deity yoga in Dzogchen practice. As such, the practice of most so called Dzogchen practice is no different than what the Sakyapas, Gelugpas and Kagyus do, even though Nyingma sadhanas are gussied up with many fancy high sounding words. The plain reality is that most people do not have the capacity or time to practice Dzogchen in a serious way. This being the case, for example, ChNN strongly advises everyone to practice the short thun, which is a anuyoga sadhana combined with ati guruyoga. He explicitly says no one can remain in samadhi (contemplation) all the time, and so therefore, in order to do something useful, we have all these secondary practices which support samadhi, which create a container for it.

As to the the importance of tradition. There is no Dzogchen without lineage. A Dzogchen book without a live transmission is like a cellphone without a battery, it won't receive any calls. Dzogchen, as ChNN says again and again, does not live in a book, it lives in the transmission between teacher and student. That transmission is oral, symbolic and experiential. All of the different methods of empowerment, elaborate and so, are all methods of communicating that knowledge orally, symbolically and  experientially. That knowledge is no different than what is communicated through the four empowerments of the Sarma schools. While the four Dzogchen empowerments may be more detailed, and in some sense they may be a bit more profound in details, a beginner cannot comprehend this. Without a great deal of understanding of Vajrayāna, the teaching of Dzogchen is completely opaque.

The teaching of Dzogchen is not confined to paeans of praise about our natural state. It consists of detailed instructions about the human body, it's channels, functions and so on, all of which require ripening through empowerment. If Dzogchen were only about our natural state, it would not go beyond the Prajñāpāramita sūtras.

As one of the Dzogchen tantras puts it — Mahāyoga is the ground, Anuyoga is the sky, and Atiyoga is the sun and moon which illuminates both. Dzogchen is called the pinnacle not because Mahāyoga and Anuyoga are unnecessary, but because, as Rongzom points out, it is needed for making other practices fruitful. This is not different than the Lamdre contention that the experiential view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana that comes from empowerment must be meditated prior to engaging in the two stages.

In the end, I am afraid that the Sakya master, Dezhung Ajam ( a disciple of Adzom Drugpa) was right, many people who claim to be Dzogchen practitioners are like people whose bodies are separated from their heads — in other words, their "Dzogchen" is just intellectual theory. Sadly, we see many such discussions in the internet in various forums by various people that are completely ungrounded. These people, sadly, merely block their own realization. What a pity.

However, you should not feel you are not qualified to receive major empowerments. It is not hard to maintain one's vows, one does so by reciting Vajrasattva 21 times every day. There is tremendous blessing from the vows. It is better to receive them and break them, then to have never received them at all.

You can however meditate on the topics of the Three Visions, and you can do any of the other kinds of the Dharma practice such as making offering, reciting sutras like the Heart Sutra and so on.

Also,  did somebody here doubted their Lama judging by the condition of sangha members around you?

Do you think faith is possible without trust? Can one change Lama in the middle of ngondro? Anyway i dont see him anymore he would hardly remember me. He closed our center here.  Wouldnt be a big deal to change,  would it?

I would really appreciate your input.  I dont trust my Lama anymore and i cant continue with ngondro and i still have mandala offering and Guru yoga to do.  Stopping practice feels very bad,  but i just cant force myself to continue.  Cant stop neither.  Please advice.

In my point of view my ngöndro is not only connected with the lama but also especially with the Buddhas. It is possible to "change" the teacher and also to have more than one lama.

(Edit: ) And however it is possible. On the other hand dharma practice should not be a stress.

The belief that taking drugs is part of the path of awakening is deeply rooted in ignorance. People who persist in this belief are most ignorant of the ignorant and are truly likely to take rebirth in the animal realm, at best.

Now, if you are a practitioner who occasionally trips for fun, but understands this as merely a distraction, well, then there is no real problem as long as you don't hurt anyone.

Of course, habitually taking drugs is definitely a violation of the vow against being intoxicated — there is simply no way around it.

Malcolm wrote:
I do, because there is nothing substantive about it at all in Indian texts. It is only mentioned once in the entire Yogacarabhumi. Other than that, the Yogacarins totally ignore it.

The Indians really did not discuss the issue of the three turnings at all, especially not the Indians you would most expect, namely the Yogacara authors, Maitreya, Asanga, Vasubandhu, etc. Not even the later Yogacara authors bring it up.

The only sustained discussion of the issue is the massive commentary on the Saṃdhinirmocana sutra preserved in the bstan 'gyur by the Korean master Wen Tshegs (Wŏnch'ŭk, 613-696).He starts his text saying:
The sovereign of Dharma taught the wheel of Dharma in three aspects. The first of those was turned in the Deer Park in Varanasi for those who were devoted the śravakayāna, and the causes and results of nirvana were fully taught. This is the Dharmawheel of the four noble truths. 

The second was the teaching of the Ārya Prajñāpāramita in sixteen gatherings such as Vulture Peak and so on to those who were devoted to the Bodhisattvayāna. 

The third, the teachings of the Saṃdhinirmocana sutras and so on in pure buddhafields such as Padmagarbha and so on and impure buddhafields, to those devoted to all yānas, is the Dharmawheel of the Mahāyāna of the definitive meaning. This is to be known as the intention of the teaching of the doctrine of the Tathāgata.
Since there is nothing like this statement by any Indian scholar in any extant text, I must conclude that certain Tibetan scholars (whether they know it or not) rely solely on a 7th century Korean Buddhist discussion of this issue in order to justify their classification of this and that class of sutras as definitive or provisional. But in reality these justifications cannot be made the basis of the extant Indian source texts in both sūtra and śastra. Of course, not having studied this 1000 folio, three volume text in detail, I cannot say whether it presents Indian sources for this idea or not. But I did't see any citations of Indian masters when during the several times I have done close words searches on the text when he discusses the three turnings.

Interestingly this text defines the Avatamsaka and the Prajñāpāramita [under the influence of the Avatamsaka] both as part of the third turning, but it defines the Nirvana Sutra as the second turning. He further states that the second vehicle only removes imputation [vikalpana], whereas the third turning clarifies the three svabhāvas, and so on.

Given that he defines the Nirvana as second turning and provisional and given that he devotes only a single sentence to a discussion of tathāgatagarbha, I think it is safe to conclude that for Wen Tshegs, tathāgatagarbha is part of the provisional second turning. It would be interesting to understand how it is that the ten Tathāgatagarbha sūtras came to be regarded by some Tibetans as the essence of the third turning given this fact, because there is surely no evidence from Indian sources that they are to be treated as such.

See this link about Wen Tsheg's text and how it came to be translated into Tibetan:

The fact is that Nyingma monasteries tend to follow whatever Madhyamaka view is dominant in their region. Nyingmapas from Amdo like Shabkar and Jigme Lingpa in general follow Tsongkhapa's presentation, as is still the case today. Nyingmapas from Central Tibet (Mindroling and Dorje Drak) also tend to follow the Gelug presentation since these monasteries are very close to Gelug spheres of influence. Dzogchen Monastery follows Sakyapa approach since they are follow Khenpo Shenga and his famous 13 treatises presentation. Phalyul tries to follow Mipham, but Mipham is very similar to Sakya. Nyingmas from Kongpo like Dudjom R, and Khathok monastery tend to follow Shentong, because a) Rigzin Tsewang Norbu was from Khatok and it was from here that  he spread Shentong spread into Kagyu anyway.

Nagarjuna and Asanga will be quoted and interpreted completely differently depending on who is grinding the ax at the time. That's just the way Tibet was.

Malcolm wrote:
The point is to understand who influenced whom, when and why. For example, Longchenpa states that Prasangika is the definitive view (as did Jigme Lingpa), but the third turnings sutras, by which he understood the ten tathāgatāgarbha sūtras, were the definitive sūtras. The ironic or interesting thing, is that the way Dzogchen texts treat the tathāgatagarbha is totally at odds with how it is treated in these ten sutras. So it becomes clear that Longchenpa used the sūtra tathāgatatagarbha doctrine in order to defend the validity of the Dzogchen tantras. Also of interest is that tathāgatagarbha does not really get mentioned much in the so called sems sde or klong sde, as far as I can determine. There is an interesting passage in the srog 'khor lo (wheel of life):
If one becomes stuck in limitations, it is the sugatagarbha.
On the other hand the Mind Mirror of Samantbhadra states:
The diverse miraculous display arises from state of inseparability, the ultimate sugatagarbha.
This in fact has a secret meaning. If you have received complete Dzogchen teachings, you will understand it, if not then I am sorry.

But reconcile this passage with the way sugatagarbha is taught in sūtra — The Mind Mirror of Vajrasattva states:
The sugatagarbha exists intrinsically in all sentient beings. That exists just as sesame seeds are permeated with oil. Its basis — it is based on the material aggregate. It’s location — it is located in the center of the heart.

I've heard that idea put forward before. In fact, isn't it standard Dzogchen perspective?

My personal spin is that enlightenment, when achieved, is retroactive. Once you become enlightened you can see that it was there all along. The story of Asanga and Maitreya comes to mind, where after 12 years of meditation Maitreya finally appears to Asanga. Asanga asked him where he'd been all that time, to which Maitreya replies, "I've been here the whole time. You just couldn't see me." Nice parable.

Malcolm wrote:

Dzogchen teaching make a clear distinction between the basis (the time of non-realization) and the result.

The real issue which causes argument is whether tathagatāgabha, a.k.a., the dharmakāya at the time of the basis, is something that is naturally perfected or something which requires development. In general, the Sakyapas for example argue that the natural perfection of the qualities of awakening in the person does not conflict with transformation in the same way the natural presence of the quality in milk which produces butter does not mitigate or render unnecessary the process of transformation which produces butter (churning). Longchenpa for example argues that while the two accumulations have always been perfected, they need to be reaccumulated in the same sense that a gem that has been lost in a swamp needs to be polished in order to restore its former luster.

That is a patent fallacy. Gzhan stong simply says the three kāyas are innate, however this is the implication of traditional Madhyamaka as well. When it comes down to it, gzhan stong really does not offer anything that cannot be found in traditional Madhyamaka.
Khenpo Tsultrim, the go-to guy for Shentong in modern day Karma Kagyu, has this to say:

Progressive Stages of Meditation on Emptiness, p.66: This non-conceptual Wisdom Mind is not the object of the conceptualizing process and so is not negated by Madyamaka reasoning. Therefore, it can be said to be the only thing that has absolute and true existence.

It is important to understand that this true existence does not mean that it can be conceptualized. If it were even the most subtle object of the conceptual process, it could be refuted by Prasangika reasoning. The non-conceptual Wisdom Mind is not something that even supreme wisdom (Skt. prajna) can take as its object. Anything that can be an object of consciousness, however pure and refined, is dependently arising and has no true existence.

Because Mahāyāna was disputed by the Śravakas, so the Buddha turned the Mahāyāna wheel a second time so there would be no mistakes or ambiguity. It really is just an Ekayāna teaching.

I really don't know where some Tibetans got the idea that it referred to Yogacara literature, but there is absolutely no justification for that interpretation that can be derived from Indian commentaries in the bstan 'gyur.

I will look out for other classes and attend them if i can, and i would love a teacher, but when asking about finding a teacher at the end of the class it doesn't sound like i would have much luck.

I'm looking for recommendations for history or biography assessing Trungpa Rinpoche's impact on Buddhism in North America, North American culture overall, or Buddhism overall.  It's not hard to find observations like this one:

Sam Bercholz said:
To see Trungpa Rinpoche is a very difficult thing because we only see this person who walked this land and taught, gave hundreds of talks, and so on. In terms of a wider perspective of history, Trungpa Rinpoche's arrival into North America in 1970 is equivalent to Padmasambhava's arrival into Tibet hundreds of years before that ... Trungpa Rinpoche's arrival in America, and what he did in those seventeen years is one of the most incredible things in Buddhist history.

I was told by a friend that doing the long practice in Tibetan would be of better use because doing the sadhana four times a day would greatly speed up my familiarity with the long practice. Any ideas? What about starting the retreat in English and slowly transitioning to the Tibetan version?

Thanks ahead of time for your input.

It is clearly different in so far as a) the Buddha clearly taught such ripening was unerring and b) your analogy is clearly false. Intentions (karmas) are obviously not like barren women.


Greg said:
As for your second point, that is like saying sky flowers have no intrinsic nature that prevents them from blooming in the sky. It is an essentially meaningless assertion that explains nothing.

Malcolm wrote:
The problem is that you are looking for a medium of transference, and Madhyamakas in general reject that there is one, apart from a dharma called a nondissipation (avipraṇāśa, chud mi za ba, which Nāgārjuna states as an opinion he prefers and defends), which functions like a debt. For example, when you borrow money or incur a debt, there is no actual medium that conveys that debt from one moment to the next. But when you owe a debt, everyone agrees that you must pay up when it is demanded of you. When it is paid, the note still exists, even though it can no longer be enforced. Likewise, when one engages in a karma, even though the act itself as ceased, a dharma called a nondissipation is created. This is why the Buddha says:
"The action of corporal beings does not dissipate
even in hundreds of eons."
Nāgar̄juna himself states:

Emptiness and non-annihilation, 
samsara and impermanence, 
the Buddha explained
the phenomena [chos] of nondissipation of karmas.

Even though karmas cease upon acting, their effect do not dissipate unless this nondissipation is removed by the path, or by moving into a dhātu where a given nondissipation is left behind because it can function in that sphere.

And this all comes about because karmas, like everything else, have no inherent nature. For which reason Candra simply says that karmas ripen because there is no nature which prevents their ripening due to fact of nondissipation.

Thus karmas are not like barren women, and do engender progeny called nondissipation.

Saṃvrti is by definition the false perception of the deluded, and nothing else. The omniscience of a buddha includes the saṃvrti that sentient beings perceive--because that is the only thing saṃvrti is. Sentient beings are not having false perceptions of the workings of karma across lifetimes, so there is nothing for the omniscience of a buddha to know. The fact that karmic action at a distance can't be accounted for in prasaṅgika is clearly a weak point in the system.

Malcolm wrote:
As for the first point, well, this obviously not the case despite the definition of samvṛiti — for example, when the Buddha says "When so on so live in such and such time, his clan name was x, the king's name was Y...", such information is not available to ordinary people. If we accept what you are claiming, someone at some time must have this idea in their minds in order for it to be known by the Buddha, thus you are placing firm restrictions on what a Buddha may know. A Buddha knows all things both in terms of their nature and their characteristics.

Secondly, karma has no intrinsic nature which prevents its ripening at a time in the future. Therefor, this is not weak link you suppose.

Karma is likened to a debt. This is Nagārjuna's preferred relative truth version of karma. Also Candrakirti accepts this.

Still, that is just a another, alternate metaphor, not an explanation. When it comes to saṃvrti, my understanding is that prasaṅgikas simply accept the conventions of deluded beings as dependently arisen mere appearances. But an action performed by a sentient being in one lifetime, which comes to fruition three lifetimes later, is not something that appears to anyone. So how can it be differentiated from an utter nonexistent like the son of a barren woman?

But such karma does appear to someone, i.e, buddha or someone with similar capacity of wisdom. It may not appear to you, but relatively speaking, many things do not appear to your which appear to others of higher or more refined faculties.

Karma Dorje said:
Sorry, missed this earlier. We have discussed this on other threads and in person: my view is that there is much that is explicit in Buddhadharma that is either implicit or missing in other paths. As such it is the most complete and direct approach to realization. Because emptiness is discussed explicitly and at length, it avoids many of the pitfalls of other paths that emphasize the awareness aspect.

For someone who has reached the goal of any of these paths, I think we can agree that all that remains is working for the welfare of others. Some bodhisattvas have renovated their own tradition, others developed new religions in places where there were none. Still others bring the view of realization to paths that either lack it completely or where it has become obscured.

Why continue to practice another path alongside one that is already complete?
Pretty much any symbol system can be used to convey the path by a mahasiddha (and many may have been the projects of prior bodhisattvas in the first place).
One can form connections to countless beings that may not have the karma to practice Buddhadharma directly and thereby hook them into eventual practice of a liberating path.
Certain practices (for example bhakti) can aid in character development.
The associated beings propitiated may bring particular temporal benefits.
Incorrigibility is entertaining.
I am sure that's not an exhaustive list, but this is the gist of why I continue to practice more than one path at the same time.

Son of Buddha said:
The concept of Moksha in the Hindu Religion is mainly of two types. These are personal and impersonal. Moksha is defined as the loving, eternal union with God and considered the highest perfection of existence. In Advaita philosophy Moksha is union with the oneness which Advaita advocates.

Malcolm wrote:
First, Advaita is not union with oneness. The Advaita model is that oneself is Brahmin, and always has been, described through the four Mahāvakyas:

Consciousness is Brahman
I am Brahman
That thou art
This Atman is Brahman

Son of Buddha said:
Ramanuja, an 11th century hindu philosopher, believed in the principle of vishishta dvaita (qualified non-dualism). According to Ramanuja, the individual soul is not identical with god. So, a devotee may worship god even after liberation or moksha. Moksha can be attained through bhakti (devotion), which involves the constant remembering of god or the surrender of the individual self to god.

Malcolm wrote:
Not exactly — in this philosohy, everything is part of Brahman and Brahman in the form of Ishvara is part of everything. Thus they refer to three principles which are all part of Brahman: Iśvara (Parabrahman), the sentient beings (chit-brahman) and the insentient Universe (achit-brahman). Iśvara and the personal self are identical. While not the best source, it tallies with my personal studies, thus Wiki states:

Son of Buddha said:
Rāmānujā chooses to take the position of universal identity. He interprets this passage to mean the subsistence of all attributes in a common underlying substratum. This is referred to as samānādhikaranya. Thus Rāmānujā says the purport of the passage is to show the unity of all beings in a common base. Ishvara (Parabrahman) who is the Cosmic Spirit for the pan-organistic body consisting of the Universe and sentient beings, is also simultaneously the innermost self (Atmān) for each individual sentient being (Jīvā). All the bodies, the Cosmic and the individual, are held in an adjectival relationship (aprthak-siddhi) in the one Isvara.

Again, it is not exactly like that. Irregardless of the beliefs of the masses, the dominant philosophy of the six darshanas is Vedanta, and among the forms of Vedanta, Advaita is the dominant form.


Son of Buddha said:
There are no differences between one Buddha and another in terms of realization; there are differences in terms of aspirations, and so on., which give rise to differences in sentient beings karmic connections with this buddhafield and that, and so on. In short, everyone who becomes a Buddha starts out as a sentient being, and there is a unique rosary of clarity that continues from the time of being a sentient being through the attainment of Vajradhara which forms the relative basis for Buddhahood.
But doesn't this type of view impute a individual self upon Buddhahood? essentially the individual self(person) is actually the one who is attaining Buddhahood, wouldn't this make the individual person/self the "attainer" and Enlightenment just a "object" that is attained by the person/self?

Malcolm wrote:
[/quote]

Relatively speaking, the Buddha states many times "When I attained awakening...", "Before I attained awakening" and "After I attained awakening" and so on. Ultimately of course there is no one who attains buddhahood, etc., and as Haribhadra points out in the Aloka Prajñāpāramitā commentary, the entire path, from beginning to end, is illusory. So this is why we must understand this through the two truths. For this reason it is said that the basis is the two truths, the path is the two accumulations, and the result is the two kāyas.

I think you overstate the usefulness of polemics against other contemplative disciplines to beginners on the path, who by and large don't want to hear what they view as mere dogmatism, particularly when there is quite obviously so much in common with other paths.

Malcolm wrote:
First, I was not suggesting you were incorrigible, that was pointed at someone else.

It is not polemics that are the point, but freeing ourselves of conceptual constructs and their pitfalls, clearly identified. The point is not to criticize others, though this point is often lost, the point is to clearly set out the view to be realized in relief, by examining the views to be discarded one by one, step by step, lower to higher, beginning with annihilationism then all views of self and all realist views, until we discover the true meaning of freedom from proliferation ourselves.

Most of us have neither sufficient faith that devotion to a guru can be our sole remedy, no matter how realized they are, nor are we sufficiently intelligent that we can avoid erroneous views without study. Therefore, for the plodders amongst us, like myself, a careful program of study in what are incorrect paths and correct paths, lower paths and higher paths, slower paths and faster paths is a necessity, not just a desiderata. In the meantime, we cultivate the best we can, devotion to gurus we do have, since this indeed is the fastest way to liberation.

Dzogchen is a part of Buddhadharma. It's basic theory is the same as the rest of Buddhadharma, i.e, suffering arises because of the false grasping to a self.

For example, the Tantra of Self-Arisen Vidyā states:
Further, samasara is as follows: 
false view and eternalist view.
The false vehicle is as follows:
held to be three hundred and sixty beliefs in a self.
And:
Likewise, the countless views of a self are included in two. Those are included in both the eternalist view and annihilationist view. Countless views of self come from those two. Likewise, son of a good family, because you have avoided entering a false path, I have summarized the views of a self and demonstrated them.
And:
The true Dharma is free from a self,
free from the extremes of the taints
of afflicted minds and so on.
And:
...since there is no appropriation, a self does not exist.
And:
All the objects and conditions of the six consciousness
depend on grasping something; 
if there is no one-sided grasping, there is bliss
free from objects grasped as “mine”,
empty of phenomena grasped as a self, 
and liberated from objects grasped as permanent.
The Tantra of Self-Liberated Vidyā states:
If one conceives of a self, it is a delusion of Māra.
And:
The one great root māra
is the concept that grasps a self.
The Union of the Sun and the Moon Tantra states:
"Beyond extremes” is not apprehending a self in things.
And:
Those of incorrect understanding are the tirthikas i.e. all views grasping to extremes and grasping to a self.

But in reality it boils down to this. There are basically two kinds of views among tīrthikas: eternalist and annihilationist. Among those who follow Buddhadharma there are the three realist tenets, Vaibhaśika, Sautrantika (one can include the views of the other Nikaya schools here) and Yogacara (a species of nondual realism), and then there is Madhyamaka, the sublime Middle Way, the crown jewel of the Buddha's teaching.

The real problem is that people who come to Buddhadharma do not properly study these non-buddhist tenets, and in doing so, often unwittingly import these views into their practice, for example, imagining the basis (gzhi) is something Brahmin and so on, and concluding the Dzogchen, for example, has the same meaning as Advaita.

Hi Malcolm,

It might also be helpful for beginners to clarify just what is meant by the term "tirthika" in Buddhist discourse, because it's easy for an outsider looking over my shoulder (like the one looking over my shoulder a few minutes ago) to suspect that this is a straw-man term without historical basis.  How would you rebut such a comment?

I'd always been thought that "tirthika" indicates a category in which certain kinds of positions may be lumped, not necessarily a specific school of thought or social institution or tradition

many thanks

Exactly. Again, my only statement was that Zen does not negate the existence of ishta-devata (meaning, that it does not negate the validity of such practices...which is what I took the OP's assertion to be). Shumon Mujintoron is one text that devotes some discussion to a Japanese Zen (Rinzai) view of Tendai and Shingon practices in particular, and it clearly asserts their validity as Buddhadharma (though naturally within its own hierarchy of traditions).

I am not completely unfamiliar with yidam practice. I mentioned the Marici blessing amulets only as an example of everyday Zen engagement with deities that figure in such practices (and mostly because I was literally working on their prep at that moment). The ceremony for empowering these involves mantra, mudra and embodiment as the deity. But I do not call this yidam practice, and since Zen generally doesn't use kanjo but rather takes seeing nature to be the necessary entry into practice, I do not call such things "Vajrayana", whatever their origins.

Sorry for Zen distraction in the Tibetan forum. Had meant to express support, actually.

As above, one cannot consider blessing protective amulets as falling under the heading of Vajrayāna practice, much less Yidam deity practice.

Actually, the term yi dam lha (iṣṭadevatā) is comparatively rare in Indian tantras, is more common in Indian commentaries, while of course it is ubiquitous in Tibetan writing. Nevertheless, my point was that a yidam is a path. That path is not common to common Mahāyāna such as Zen, while of course there is nothing barring anyone from practicing any of the divisions of tantra.

From the perspective of East Asian Mahayana - to what Zen belongs to - the validity of Vajrayana is rarely if ever questioned. There is even a "Secret Teaching Division" (volumes 18-21) in the Taisho Canon that includes all kinds of Tantric texts. In China many Vajrayana works were translated, especially during the Yuan (Mongolian) dynasty, as the court favoured Tibetan Buddhism. In Japan the Shingon school has existed since the 9th century. So, Tantric teachings and methods are recognised as valid in Mahayana beyond Tibet.

Legend then has it that the Buddha bestowed upon him the Guhysamaja empowerment during which Indrabhuti fully awakened.

Most people do not understand that abhiśeka is a method of awakening. It is only if someone does not awaken fully or at all during the empowerment that it is necessary to practice sadhana.

You don't understand the later Tibetan authors, sorry to say. The only lack of consensus is among westerners who really do not have a grasp of difficult tantric subjects, written in intentional language (i.e. coded), who are also unfamiliar with the broad range of the textual tradition and rely on tiny slices of translations of varying qualities and differing terminologies with which to form their views.

The protection chakra/body mandala I posted above has a Sri Lankan version as well.

So what you're saying is that these practices weren't derived from previous Vajrayana practice.  Which is what I thought was likely due to the region's long history of Vajrayana practice( archaeological evidence supports Hevajra practice reaching it's historical peak during the Khmer empire ).

That means there must have been a separate esoteric transmission just for SE Asia, which doesn't make much sense to me.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct, what I am saying is that these practices have no clear cut path to the presence of Vajrayāna SE Asia. They are not Vajrayāna practices, whatever else they may be.

The exoteric practice of protection amulets, protective visualizations and so on are wide spread in the Indian culture sphere. That does not make them related to Vajrayāna or even lower Secret Mantra.

My guess is that you are probably resistant to this being called "tantric", due to the lack of an empowerment.  Fair enough.  Perhaps "derived from tantra, but not tantra" is more accurate.

Malcolm wrote:
I don't think so. Calling these things "tantric" comes from an ignorant and anachronistic use the term from the early 20th century. In other words, the term really has no meaning. There was never any tradition in India that called itself "tantric". There are many traditions in India that followed manuals (tantras), from Ayurveda (in whose texts is found the the earliest use of the term) to Yoga, Kauala, so on and so forth.

In practice, it does not work out that way, because people are not so enlightened that working in their own self-interest actually functions this way — this the great weakness in the secular ethical model. Sooner or later selfishness trumps insight. Nevertheless, this is a working theory in secular ethics.

There are other secular ethical models, such as Kant's moral imperative and so on, which do not require belief in rebirth or religious authority of any kind. Western ethical philosophy is quite rich, and can't be reduced to the catechistic moralism of Christianity.

i I think rebirth is hard for people to accept mainly because;

1. it's extraordinarily hard to grasp it intellectually, if it's possible at all.
2. If you meditate on it and view it through a detached viewpoint -- "Who is there to be reborn?" Will likely be most peoples response.

All thing's are inter-dependently arisen, yet all those arisen thing's are still empty, not one thing has a self, so this delusion that we are independent beings of some permanent nature is why rebirth is hard to grasp.

All sentient beings are just made up of empty non-self stuff, yet we still exist. So essentially I think you could say we are that empty non-self stuff, and at the same time nothing at all, we are phantoms. Phantoms will continue to arise, and cease thinking they were something other than empty inter-dependent stuff.

Many people bring the word "materialism" unwittingly with the Marxist or AntiMarxist emotional baggage to spiritual discussions.

Malcolm wrote:
When I use the term materialism, I am referring the followers of the rishi Brihaspati, the Carvaka school, specifically, and generally, to all those who imagine that upon their physical death their mind stream utterly ceases having no further causes and conditions which can support it.

The 5th Century Greek physical theory of Democritus of atomos "indivisible", and re-contexted in India means and seems to mean one thing.

and later Marxist anti-religionist "materialism means and seems to mean another.

One who denies rebirth is an ucchedavadin and a materialist. Marxists also reject rebirth, etc. They are also ucchedavadins. There are many stripes ucchedavadins. Also, the ancient Carvakas wrote much of the political literature of ancient India (Kautilya, for example).

Leo Rivers said:
I am not a Marxist. Their “materialism” isn't truly scientific. It is politics. As an atheist I am not anti-religion. My "atheism" is a secondary issue to someone who believes all the phenomena witnessed in the cosmos are the outcome of natural processes, cause and effect. Sound familiar?

Malcolm wrote:
The rejection of rebirth amounts to a rejection of karma, among other things, such as the serial ripening of actions performed now on a serial, albeit impermanent, mind stream in the future. There is really no way to reconcile rejection of rebirth with the Buddha's Dharma. Further, the rejection of rebirth entails that consciousness newly arise, as indicated by your term "new beings", etc., again, completely inconsistent with the Dharma the Buddha taught in all vehicles, not merely one.

It is fine if someone does not believe in rebirth, but I question whether they can truly call themselves followers of the Buddha. You ask, "Doesn't Samsara recognition, the Bodhisattva Vow, the practice of the path of calming and insight and a recognition of the empty nature of self and phenomena comprise sufficient credentials?"

Without rebirth, there is no samsara worthy of the name, there is no cyclic existence, no 'khor ba, there no possibility that one, having been born a human being, can take rebirth in a higher realm or a lower realm, at death one simply ceases. One's birth as a human being is merely random and not connected with any accumulation of merit and so on.

Without rebirth, the bodhisattva vow is just empty verbiage, "From now until I reach the bodhimaṇḍa, the seat of awakening...", etc. Moreover, secular altruistic ethics are just fine, and are certainly more appropriate for people who do not have a deep felt faith commitment to the Dharma. There is thus no need to flatter oneself that one is a "secular" bodhisattva. Certain kinds of beliefs, such as the belief that one's consciousness is extinguished either at nirvana, in the case of śravakas, or at death, in the case of materialists are deeply incompatible with the bodhisattva aspiration.

Without rebirth, there is no transcendent insight to speak of because the purpose of insight in Buddhadharma is to burn away the traces of affliction which cause one to be reborn in samsara again and again and to cultivate omniscience in order to benefit other sentient beings from now until we reach the bodhimaṇḍa. This is the only reason we are cultivating insight into emptiness. David Hume recognized the empty nature of self and phenomena. But his insight is mundane and not transcendent, it neither eradicates obscurations nor does it lead to gathering the accumulation of wisdom, pristine consciousness (jñāna). His thought is not Buddhadharma, because Hume, at the end of the day, was a materialist. There is no point in even mentioning śamatha, because śamatha is simply one-pointedness of mind, and even animals have it.

My point is simple, physicalism, materialism, etc., whatever one wants to call it, is not compatible with Buddhadharma.

All pre-Modern Buddhisms likely accept re-incarnation. For me the Bodhisattva Vow to practice to benefit all beings makes personal reincarnation irrelevant - who caused my pre-birth circumstances or inherits my consequences is beside the point. The point is to transform the basis of my charactor and the mutually experience world of karmas.

Malcolm wrote:
The bodhisattva vow is predicated on the principle of person rebirth or reincarnation. Without rebirth, there is no karmic world, so to speak, because there is no karma-vipaka.

Further, without rebirth, there is no way to accumulate the two accumulations necessary to achieve buddhahood, nor is there any point in making such an aspiration.

There may be so-called "Buddhists" who have doubts about or even reject rebirth, but there is no valid Buddhadharma that does. So called "Buddhists" are those who a least nominally follow Buddhadharma, but when people reject the very basic principles upon which Buddhadharma is founded, what is the point of calling them Buddhists, much less followers of Buddhadharma?

So just to clarify my own thinking with regards to the three types of Dukkha

1) Dukkha Dukkha - This would be the suffering cuased by pain, such as 'ouch i just stubbed my toe'

2) Viparinama Dukkha - This is the suffering of change due to all things being impermenant, as such even if something is giving us pleasure now, such as being in a relationship, then this will ultimatly end up as suffering like when the relationship ends

3) Sankhara Dukkha - The suffering all condition phenomona. This is due to the very nature of 'things' as being part of conditioined phonmena. So even though this really tasty food gives me pleasure now, becuase of the impermenane inherent in the food, it is not a lasting pleasure, and as such wil only result in suffering once the taste goes due to my craving the food.

so how far of the mark am I? I get the feeling im possibly getting Viparinama and Sankhara dukkha slightly confused, but not sure where the confusion lies. They both seem very similer to me, in the sense that its due to the impermenane of things that cuase the suffering (due to the attachment/craving to things).

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, you are getting these two confused. The third is the fact that things just fall apart and so therefore cannot be considered a source of happiness.

All positive things that sentient beings do generate such roots, and the Buddhas teach only virtue, therefore, all positive things that happen to sentient beings are a blessing of the Buddhas because the Buddhas bless all roots of virtue as such. Every teaching, every word, which encourages sentient beings to generate virtue is the word of the Buddha, and it does not matter in which religion or secular philosophy it is found — all of them are the teaching of the Buddha, the ultimate root of such teachings come out of the very basis which gives rise to Buddhahood itself, cultivating the root of virtue and generating compassion for sentient beings. Buddhas have limitless compassion so of course they automatically "wish" the benefit of sentient beings.

Buddhas offer us the medicine to cure this condition, but if we do not take it, then like the sick person who does not follow their doctor's instructions, then we have only ourselves to blame for not getting well.

In the end, brendan, we are responsible for our own liberation, there are no Buddhas to lift us out of samsara like mewling kittens being moved to a safe place by mother cat. This does not mean however that Buddhas are not all around us, benefitting us all the time in ways we cannot or will not perceive.

All harm that comes to us is a result of our afflicted vision. All benefit that comes to us is the blessings of the Buddhas — if we train with this attitude, then our attitude will improve remarkably.

it may seem a small thing, but when you use a locative construction like "in samsara" it cannot help but bring a whiff of reification. You know very well samsara is not a place that a sentient being finds itself in, its a state of mind. So wouldn't it be better to say "I am just as deluded that there is happiness in my samsaric mind"? Thats harder to say perhaps because its owning your state of mind rather than projecting, but it has far more potential for change. Its much easier to imagine a state of mind changing than a universe.

From the point of view of Mahāyāna, buddhas experiences only pleasurable mental sensations, i.e., bliss, and no painful physical sensations.  A Buddha is also totally free of clinging. All painful feelings of the body are the ripened result of negative karma. Buddhas have no obscuration of karma. All pleasurable feelings of the mind are the ripened result of positive actions.

The suffering or dukha of sentient beings. Does having pure vision mean having a fantasy about everything being pure? No, even if we have pure vision 24/7 we still must keep in mind that sentient beings including ourselves are under the power of affliction and karma.

Will we live forever? No. Will we get sick, die, etc. Yes. Will we be suffering? By definition, yes. Even if we are able to go beyond it through meditation, the very fact of conditioned existence is that it is suffering from top to bottom. Dzogchen is not a get out of jail free card. Dzogchen is the path of seeing how ignorance creates this state we live in, and then how to escape it. This is one of the reasons why in Dzogchen the prison metaphor is used so often.

Since  ordinary sentient beings never have direct correct cognitions, they never experienced ultimate truth, ever, even though all things possess two natures, one relative, the other ultimate.

The basis difference among these different species of gzhan stong has to do with how whether one follows in the footsteps of Jonang, or Shakya Chogden.

Well, The current interest in Shentong is almost entirely due to the writings of Kongtrul, so I'd say that is Phase Five--in some sense, the phase we are currently in.  Of course, he was disciple of Situ Panchen at Palpung. When it's taught these days, Kongtrul's texts and commentaries are the ones that are most often used in the Kagyu lineage, at least.   But I believe, also, Khyentse Wangpo was a Shentongpa, was he not?

Also, Kongtrul is considered to be the Tulku of Jetsun Taranatha (amongst others, of course).

It would be interesting to explore further any relationship between the presentation of Shentong and the Tantric view espoused in Kalacakra, too.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, but Kongtrul largely follows Shakya Chogden, and not Dolbupa and Taranatha, even though he gives lip service to both of the former, what he actually presents is more consistent with Chogden.

Some people might say that Khyentse was a gzhan stong pa, but I wouldn't. His take on the treatises of Maitreya is that they concerned luminosity and the treatises of Nāgārjuna concerned emptiness. Since these two are actually synonymous from a Sakya point of view, I don't think you can call Khyentse a gzhan stong pa. He instead presents the Sakya position in a text called The Madhyamaka Instructional Manual that Harmonizes the Two Traditions, "meaning Nāgārjuna and Maitreya.

When considering the point of view of Maitreya, he states that in this system, the wisdom at the time of the basis, the luminous original nature of the mind, is the basis of samsara and nirvana. He says:

"The non-recognition of that, which manifests the appearances of dualistic delusions along with their latent traces, is this connate ignorance that is the root of the samsara. Therefore, it is very important to cut the root of this and and dissolve it into the dharmadhātu."

He identifies this wisdom or pure consciousness, the luminous nature of the mind, as the dharmadhātu. In reference to the much discussed moon metaphor, he states:

"The luminous original nature of the mind free from free from dualism is clear like a moon disc, is non-conceptual and exists in one's heart."

He never discusses this in terms of the three natures and so on, which is characteristic of gzhan stong in general, and the basis for most criticism of gzhan stong, incidentally.

When he does talk about gzhan stong, he discusses it in a series of texts I call "Three Madhyamaka views." he says:

conebeckham said:
The is the position of the great omniscient Jonang pa is discussed briefly, ultimate truth is without arising or perishing, unconditioned and beyond dependent origination. Relative truth has the character of arising and perishing, depends on cause and conditions and is conditioned.

Malcolm wrote:
When he presents the Sakya view, it is identical to his presentation in The Madhyamaka Instructional Manual that Harmonizes the Two Traditions.

As for the three aspects of dukkha - it doesn't alter my point - all three aspects have to do with subjective experience.
Just because something is subjective in the sense of being experienced doesn't mean that it is subjective in the sense of being purely a matter of personal opinion. If this weren't the case that would mean that one couldn't say anything objective whatsoever about anything involving the mind. If someone were to claim that it is not objectively true that emotions exist because they are part of personal experience, would anyone take them seriously? It can be objectively true that something is a part of experience, and that doesn't make it any less objective.

When they do have that experience, as bodhisattvas in the first bhumi, their suffering still exists, but for them it is now like a dream or an illusion. Further, they can then eradicated the obscurations to full buddhahood.

Besides the Jonang school, the Kagyu school also has Shentong teachings, and also some Nyingmapas follow some form of Shentong (I've heard in some places that Ju Mipham was a Shentongpa for example, but I don't know how true that is). Could someone give a summary of how Shentong is presented and what the major differences between them of Shentong are in these different traditions?

Malcolm wrote:
The origins of gzhan stong lie in the master Tsan Kawoche. He received teachings on the six limb yoga of Kalacakra from Somanatha (though apparently the translator was not good, and he did not understand Sanskrit). The lineage of instructions of this view eventually came down to Dolbupa, who gave the first formal voice to gzhan stong teachings. They were very popular for roughy 150 years and stimulated a lot of controversy because of Dolbupa's very literal reading of many passages in sutra and tantra and unique approach to Buddhist history.

His views were hotly contested by many scholars in Sakya especially, and also in Gelug.

This is phase one.

Phase two begins with Shakya Chogden, a Sakya scholar (15th century) who took a revolutionary (for Tibet) approach to Madhyamaka and tried to reconcile the views of the Yogacara and Madhyamaka, in some of his writings declaring them both definitive.

This is phase two.

Phase three consists of Jonang Taranatha's reply to various formulations of gzhan stong view, as well as rejecting arguments against Dolbupa in particular.

This is phase three.

Phase four comes about when RIgzin Tsewang Norbu a Nyingma abbot, terton and scholar who lived in the 18th century sought to revive Kalacakra and received Kalacakra from the Jonangpas surviving in central Tibet. He passed them onto Situ Panchen, who established both the gzhan stong view as well as the Dro system of Kalacakra at Palpung.

The basis difference among these different species of gzhan stong has to do with how whether one follows in the footsteps of Jonang, or Shakya Chogden.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, if you like inhaling Lead and Polonium 210 and spreading it around for other people to inhale, go for it —‚ but it hardly seems like bodhisattva activity to me to knowingly spread radioactive contaminates where other people can inhale them.

LastLegend said:
How many people are exposed to radioactivity in cigarettes?

According to the American Lung Association, there are about 48 million adult smokers in the U.S., and 4.8 million adolescent smokers. This means that the U.S., population, directly exposed to radioactivity in cigarette smoke, is approximately 53 million.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 80 percent of adult tobacco users started smoking as teens; 35 percent had become daily smokers by age 18. Thirty nine percent of adult smokers smoke one pack of cigarettes per day, and 20% smoke more than a pack a day.

Smoking is the number one cause of preventable death in the U.S., with 443,000 deaths, or 1 of every 5 deaths, in the United States each year. And, there are 123,000 lung cancer deaths annually attributed to smoking cigarettes. Nearly 1 of every 5 deaths is related to smoking, more than alcohol, car accidents, suicide, AIDS, homicide, and illegal drugs combined.

In addition to smokers, those exposed to secondhand or side-stream smoke have been shown to risk disease as well. In some studies, it has been found that side-stream or secondhand smoke is two to five times more concentrated in some carcinogens than the mainstream smoke inhaled by a smoker. Each year, approximately 3,400 nonsmoking adults die of lung cancer as a result of breathing the smoke of others’ cigarettes. Environmental tobacco smoke also causes an estimated 46,000 deaths from heart disease in people who are not current smokers. Secondhand smoke contains over 4,000 chemical compounds, including 69 known carcinogens such as formaldehyde, lead, arsenic, benzene, and radioactive polonium 210.

How does radioactive material get into a cigarette?

The tobacco leaves used in making cigarettes contain radioactive material, particularly lead-210 and polonium-210. The radionuclide content of tobacco leaves depends heavily on soil conditions and fertilizer use.

Soils that contain elevated radium lead to high radon gas emanations rising into the growing tobacco crop. Radon rapidly decays into a series of solid, highly radioactive metals (radon decay products). These metals cling to dust particles which in turn are collected by the sticky tobacco leaves. The sticky compound that seeps from the trichomes is not water soluble, so the particles do not wash off in the rain. There they stay, through curing process, cutting, and manufacture into cigarettes.Lead-210 and Polonium-210 can be absorbed into tobacco leaves directly from the soil. But more importantly, fine, sticky hairs (called trichomes) on both sides of tobacco leaves grab airborne radioactive particles.

For example, phosphate fertilizers, favored by the tobacco industry, contain radium and its decay products (including lead-210 and polonium-210). When phosphate fertilizer is spread on tobacco fields year after year, the concentration of lead-210 and polonium-210 in the soil rises.

Malcolm wrote:

Queequeg said:
For one, suffering here is a qualitative, subjective characterization, which while a compelling one to an extent, is not necessarily true for everyone. There are many people who, though not enlightened by Buddhist standards, have reflected on their life, settled in equanimity, and come to a conclusion about all this - "Its life." Neither good, nor bad. It just is what it is. With that conclusion, they go on living in many different ways, taking the joys and sorrows, triumphs and tragedies, in stride. With the First Noble Truth undermined, the rest of it falls apart.

We can add a footnote and say that suffering is a technical description of the unpleasant experience of perpetually changing circumstances, but that's still undermined by, "Its life."

Well for one thing the whole "empty of other" view, regardless of sect, seems to have been a Tibetan development. It seems to have gained traction in the last few hundred years. Guy Newland has some YouTube videos that go over all that.

Malcolm wrote:
gZhan stong became popular in Karma Kagyu in the 18th century in eastern Tibet because Situ Panchen was  disciple of the abbot of Kathog, RIgzin Tsewang Norbu, who advised the former to adopt gzhan stong because it was more positive and therefore it would extend Situ Panchens' life. Because it was adopted by this powerful Karma Kagyu lama, gzhan tong was revived at Palpung near Dege, where Kongtrul studied. But of course this was not the gzhan stong of the Jonangpas, but was a rather modified version largely influenced by the Sakya master Serdog Panchen.

gzhan stong is not a heresy per se. It is regarded by many people as a mistaken way of presenting the two truths of Madhyamaka via the three natures of Yogacara.

Personally, I don't care what sutrayāna view people hold (Yogacara or Madhyamaka), because that is not the view with which Vajrayāna practitioners attain realization. The view Vajrayāna practitioners attain realization with is the experiential view inculcated during empowerment. It really does not matter much what one's intellectual predilections are (unless you are a Gelug, then it matters very much, as far as they are concerned) when it comes to Mahāyāna tenets (Yogacara or Madhyamaka) since they are somewhat irrelevant to the actual practice of Vajrayāna.

The real point in all of this is that there are some people who follow gzhan stong views who reify jñāna as something which truly exists, and this deeply contradicts Dzogchen view, as indicated by the opening passages of the Unwritten Tantra states:
Hey, hey, apparent yet non existent retinue: listen well! There is no object to distinguish in me, the view of self-originated  pure consciousness; it did not exist before, it will not arise later, and also does not appear in anyway in the present. The path does not exist, action does not exist, traces do not exist, ignorance does not exist, thoughts do not exist, mind does not exist, wisdom does not exist, samsara does not exist, nirvana does not exist, vidyā itself does not even exist, totally not appearing in anyway.
But you really cannot understand this without studying and practicing under a real master.

For example, the doctrine of tathāgatagarbha is found in both sūtra and Dzogchen. However, if you compared the actual doctrine of tathāgatagarbha in Dzogchen compared to that of sūtra you would scratch your head in astonishment.

Even though the teaching of tathāgatagarbha in Dzogchen radically goes beyond how it is presented in sūtra, nevertheless, the tathāgatagarbha sutra citations are used (especially by Longchenpa) as a preliminary step for preparing (intellectual) people to understand tathāgatagarbha in Dzogchen.

Therefore, the conclusive intention of the the Two Promulgators actually abides without contradiction in the nature of the Great Perfection.

In the footnotes it says the "Two Promulgators" are Nagarjuna and Asanga. Also I believe "Eulogy to the Expanse of Reality" has been translated into English as "In Praise of Dharmadhatu", which is a Shentong book.

As a Karma Kagyu I interpret what he just said to be akin to Kongtrul's position that any understanding of Shentong has to be predicated on an understanding of Madhyamaka, meaning that phenomena need to be seen as self-empty before you can see them as "images on the magic mirror".

Malcolm wrote:
1) It is not so simple to say that Dharmadhātustava is a 'gzhan stong' book, just like one cannot declare the Uttaratantra a "gzhan stong" book. For example:
Having abandoned concepts and investigation, 
the absence of the inherent existence of phenomena itself
is meditated as the dharmadhātu.
2) It is also not erroneous to state that the reality the Buddha describes in the sutra is the same reality presented in Dzogchen.

3) Therefore, your attempt to prove that Dudjom R's presentation subsumes his understanding of Dzogchen under gzhan stong is not proven, far from it.

What is at stake here is how that "natural reality" is to be experienced and realized. All approaches to the middle way in sutra, no matter whether you take Nāgārjuna or Maitryanatha's approach are analytical and intellectual, that is the problem with spros bral, gzhan stong, dge lug madhyamaka and so on — they are all analytical, philosophical approaches to reality. This is ultimately the difference between sutra and tantra, as the great translator Drogmi pointed, the view of sutra is intellectual, the view of mantra is experiential. Even if gzhan stong were the most refined, most detailed, highest, most sublime approach to sūtra, it would be still be intellectual and analytical and therefore quite coarse and inferior compared to the experiential view of mantra.

Yes! On pages 294-300 he goes through the lower 8 yanas and their views. What I just quoted on p. 300 is his view of Dzogchen specifically as juxtaposed with--and superior to--the lower 8 yanks. That view is what makes Dzogchen superior! (Hence the title of the chapter: Superiority of Atiyoga.)

In the Bodhisattvayāna Madhyamaka is considered the highest view. Then of course we can disagree about what Madhyamaka means, but it is very plainly stated in all Dzogchen texts that the view of Dzogchen surpasses the views of the eight lower yanas.

So while Dzogchen masters can argue about the various merits of this or that interpretation of Madhyamaka, in the end their view will be Dzogchen and not Madhyamaka, no matter whether they prefer gzhan stong Madhyamaka (Dudjom R, Kongtrul), Gelug Prasanga (Jigme Lingpa) or Pre-Gelug Prasanga (Longchenpa, etc.)  Gorampa (Khenpo Shenga, etc.) and the views of the eight lower yanas will always be subordinate to the view of Dzogchen in their eyes.

From "The Big Red Book", the chapter on "Superiority of Atiyoga" (a.k.a. Dzogchen), p.300:

Now concerning this natural expression of the Great Perfection: The Sugata, during the intermediate promulgation of the transmitted precepts (a.k.a self-emptiness) did not reveal the structure of the fundamental reality, though he did extensively teach the inconceivable, abiding nature without referring to symbols of elaborate conception. And, during the final promulgation (a.k.a other-emptiness), though he did reveal the structure of the fundamental reality, he did not teach the characteristic path through which it is actualized.
(formatting mine)

So yes, Dudjom R. did not claim that his Great Madhyamaka/Shentong view was a path. It was just a view.

Malcolm wrote:
That is not what this passage means. It is not a reference to so called rang stong and gzhan stong.

It is a reference to the fact that tathagātagarbha teachings (a vital part of Dzogchen), according to Longchenpa, are part of the so called third turning of the wheel (a turning so important that it garners virtually no comments at all from the Indian authors preserved in the bstan 'gyur).

However, as I have pointed out, when the sole source (Samdhinirmocana sutra) for the notion of three turnings is actually examined, it is merely a restatement of the doctrine of the second turning in unequivocal terms.

However, Longchenpa never explains the tathagatagarbha according to the gzhan stong system, and he clearly explains the three own natures as belong to cittamatra which he considers inferior to Madhyamaka.

When he treats the issues of Madhyamaka and the tathāgatagarbha, he clearly states in the sgrub mtha' mdzod that Prasanga Madhyamaka is the definitive view of Mahāyāna and that the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras are the definitive sutras.

Of course, Dudjom Rinpoche followed his own teachers in this respect, and he embraced the Karma Kagyu presentation of gzhan stong when it comes to the view of Madhyamaka.

It was his presentation for sutra level meditational experience only.

You are suffering from an idea promulgated amongst many non-Nyingmapas that there is no difference in view between sutra and tantra, and that the view of sutra that you have is the same view that you apply in tantra. But this is not true in the Nyingma school, where each of the nine yanas has its own view.

What sense does it make to establish suchness as a "self", someone's identity?

Son of Buddha said:
I didn't establish the True Self as someones Identity, nor do the Sutras.

Malcolm wrote:
First of all, the term "true self" as opposed to the "false self" does not occur in any Buddhist text. It is a pop Hindu terminology.



Son of Buddha said:
So if Substantial means that which is truly real, Truly existent, not illusory, Then yes Enlightenment/True Self is Substantial.

Malcolm wrote:
Substantial in this case means self held by non-Buddhists immediately preceding the passage you cite:


"...The self maintained by vulgar children is held to be the size of a thumb, the size a white mustard seed or the size of an atom. Since such a self was not mentioned by the Tathāgata, even though he explains that there is no self in phenomena, it is not that there is truly no self. The "self" is any dharma that is true, pure, permanently existing, independent, unchanging and undying, that is what is called "self", just as that great physician is skilled in using milk as medicine."

So, here the Buddha is not teaching a substantial self like the some other nonbuddhists do, as I said before.

The other important point is that Buddha taught selflessness in order to tame nonbuddhists. If you run around saying that Buddha taught a self, then how will nonbuddhists be able to distinguish the self they taught from the suchness as the real nature of phenomena? This is why even still, despite what provisional texts like the Nirvana sutra say, the central teaching of the Buddha is selfless of persons and phenomena.

People who run around saying that Buddha taught "enlightenment" as the "true self" really do a disservice to sentient beings who have not been cured of wrong views of the self. In fact the Buddha did not teach self or selflessness as a definitive teaching.

The Nirvana sutra's use of the term "self" is a play on words, where the meaning of atman as a transmigrating self (rejected by the Buddha) is contra posed with the meaning of atman as "nature" (emptiness, suchness, etc.). If however, one suggests that the meaning of this is all the qualities of Buddhahood fully exist from the beginning with the continuums of sentient beings, rather than as an inherent potential, then your position is no different than non-buddhists who assert a substantial self.

And anyway, we have already seen that the the Buddha defined self as jñāna, meaning the nature of consciousness itself.

This naturally pure basic constituent of a one-gone-thus, ultimate

And similarly it does not have the least factor of qualities of.purification
to be set up because the status of the ultimate qualities
of the powers and so forth being spontaneously established from
the start and being indivisible is its nature.

The Buddha Nature is the very nature of all living beings, for the Buddha this nature is Fully realized(Pure Enlightenment with no flaws nor marks of the 3 poisons, greed anger or ignorance)

For Samsaric beings This very nature(Buddha Nature) resides in all of us in its pure "form" naturally perfect(our true nature our true self), yet it is obscured by adventious defilements that make up and constitute a living samsaric being.

So what it comes down to is (1) Enlightenment in its perfect state with no defilements obscuring it.(BuddhaHood)
and (2) Enlightenment in its perfect state with defilements obscuring it(Samsaric beings)

The thusness that itself abides as the fruit of purification in a
buddha abides as the basis of purification in sentient beings, and the thusness
that itself abides as the basis of purification in sentient beings abides as
the fruit of purification in a buddha because with respect to the thusness of
sentient beings and of buddhas there is not the slightest difference of entity,
just as there is not the slightest difference in entity in the space pervading all
of where there are and are not clouds. Hence, the naturally pure thusness is,
due to the person, together with defilement and also without defilement
and is, due to the person, the basis of purification and also the fruit of purification.
Consequently, it is necessary to become skilled in the profound
essentials of flawless non-contradiction.(Dolpopa)

Son of Buddha said:
Chapter 11 Nirvana Sutra

Malcolm wrote:
States the following:

Child of a good family, "buddhanature" is ultimate emptiness. Ultimate emptiness is "wisdom." In that respect, "empty" is not perceived to be either empty or not empty.  Through discerning wisdom [prajñā] all that is empty, not empty, permanent, impermanent, suffering, bliss, self and non-self is seen. "Empty" is  all samsara. "Not-empty" is parinirvana. Samsara is in the range of the selfless, "self" is parinirvana. To see everything as empty; but not see what is not empty is  not "the middle path." To not see everything as in the range of the selfless, but not see the self is not "the middle path". "The middle path" is buddhanature.

Of course, now we meed to understand what wisdom, jñāna, is according to this text. After giving a description of various samadhis, the Buddha then earlier in the text:

"Wisdom" is to be understood as the buddhanature that exists in all sentient beings".

Further, when we consider the four categories of permanence, bliss, self and purity, the Buddha states:

For the worldly there is permanence, bliss, self and purity. Also for the transcendent there is permanence, bliss, self and purity. Worldly Dharmas are expressible, but meaningless. Transcendent Dharmas are expressible and also meaningful. 

If it is asked why that is so, since Worldly Dharmas possessing four distortions, the meaning cannot be realized. If it is asked how so? Their perception is distorted, their mind is distorted and their view is distorted, and because of these three distortions, the worldly see bliss as suffering, see the permanent as impermanent, see the self as not a self, and see the pure and impure, thus these are distortions. Because of distortions the worldly speak the words [permanence, bliss, self and purity] but do not understand the meaning. 

In that respect, if it is asked what the meaning is, the selfless is "samsara"; self is the "Tathāgata"; impermanent is the śravakas and pratyekabuddhas; permanent is the dharmakāya of the Tathāgata. Suffering is all tīrthikas; bliss is parinirvana; impurity is conditioned phenomena; purity is the pure dharmas of the buddhas and bodhisattvas. Therefore, this is undistorted.

As we can see, we do not need to take the Buddha literally on the point of the self, because if we did, we would be left with the negative consequence that we should all have all the perfect qualities of buddhas and bodhisattvas present fully formed in our mind streams. Anyone can see this is not so.

So Trungpa is perfectly in accord with the Buddha because the way some people these days present the teachings of the Buddha in the Nirvana sutra is quite distorted, presenting the teaching of the Nirvana Sutra in the manner of the worldly interpretation of permanence, bliss, self and purity and leading others astray.

I understand that you have a kind of nominalist, anti-"mystical" bent but, honestly, when I read this passage, from "On The Nature Of Samantabhadra: A Conversation with Chögyal Namkhai Norbu", the epilogue to "The Supreme Source": Question: But if all beings are Samantabhadra, can we say that there are infinite Samantabhadras?
Answer: We could also think that there are infinite Samantabhadras, but when we are in the state of Samantabhadra, what does "infinite" mean? This is already a limited viewpoint. The true condition is beyond numbers. If we think in terms of an "individual being" this means that we are limiting, and consequently everything becomes complicated. If we want to understand, then we must not limit.
Question: In every tantra there is a dialogue, such as the dialogue between dharmakaya and sambhogakaya in the Kunjed Gyalpo tantra. What is the real meaning of this?
Answer: It is a way of communicating knowledge. The transmission of knowledge comes from the state of rigpa that has never been stained and has never been hindered. This is the Adibuddha, or "primordial Buddha," Kunjed Gyalpo.
Question: Is the state of Adibuddha, or Kunjed Gyalpo, something universal, present in all beings?
Answer: The state of Kunjed Gyalpo is knowledge, and in knowledge there is not even the concept of "one and two," otherwise we have already entered into dualism. Also the concept of "individual" presupposes dualistic vision. But Samantabhadra is beyond all this, isn't he?
it just doesn't seem to be the same view.


Malcolm wrote:
Your primordial state [basis] is yours. Your rigpa is yours. It does not belong to someone else, was not created by Samantabhadra, God, Chance, or anything else. As long as one persists in reifying the basis, for that long one will never understand Dzogchen teachings.

BTW:

The view established intellectually we need to establish consciously in dependence upon one’s capacity of knowledge and on convention. The way of establishing that is the system of Prasanga Madhyamaka commented upon by the great being Nāgārjuna and his followers. There is no system of view better than that.

The basis [primordial state] is a way of describing how we become buddhas by recognizing our real state or sentient beings by not recognizing that state, as well as describing how our real nature is whether we recognize it or not.

As described above, the term "ground of being" was coined by Tillich as a term for God. Hence it is not a proper term to be used in Buddhadharma at all.

From Replies to Nyang Tingzin Zangpo:

Unknown said:
Again Guru Rinpoche said:
“There are as many Dharma practitioners as stars in the sky, but few are without the obstacles of māra, like the sun and moon. If one is without the obstacles of māra, it would be easy to attain liberation in a single year. Therefore, necessary to recognize māra and overthrow him.

In the beginning, when one is staying in the city of samsara’s suffering, also one’s faith in Dharma is slight; carried away by the “māra of laziness”, one is angry at enemies, loving to friends, one thinks of mutual satisfaction, one is distracted by mundane activities, one is not mindful of death. Because of the activities of deluded appearances one remains in procrastination. That is called “māra”.
The method of overpowering that māra is to seek out a qualified Guru, the cause of unimpaired faith. Meditate on death and impermanence, the cause of unimpaired diligence. Having established one’s priorities, flee towards the Dharma.

At that time, māras turning one’s thinking in the wrong direction will arise. Some will manifest as one’s kin and companions, “Don’t practice Dharma” they will say and will cause obstacles by various means. Some will manifest as terrifying enemies or manifest as competitors and property. Since the human life of deceptions is exposed, slipping away day after day, and in the end one sinks deeper into the mire of samsara. To subdue it, having entrusted one’s mind to the jewel of the Guru, it is necessary to have the resolve not to seek advice from secular counselors. [8/a]

When one arrives in the presence of the Guru, the māra who accompanies doubts arises. The sign of his entry is to not perceive the qualities of the Guru. Even subtle faults are perceived. Incorrect views regarding his practice of interpretable deeds arise.

Thinking it is necessary to go to hell after giving whatever donations were received to the Dharma is a māra. To subdue it, develop the thought of the Guru as a Buddha.

At that time, the māra of turning away from Dharma arises. One will think of women, wealth, business, be deceitful and hoard.  The sign of the entry of that māra is one will give up one’s Dharma clothes, companions, and Dharma practice. One will not wish to listen to Dharma. One’s behavior will be mundane and one will have attachments and aversions. One will be greatly attached to evil alcohol. One will turn one’s back on the teachings of the Buddha. To subdue it, develop perseverance towards the Dharma, sublime of the sublime. One should be diligent whatever profound Dharma to which one is inclined. Remain very far away from women and irreligious activities. It is important to think about the liberation accounts of one’s predecessors.

At that time, the māra of being jaded about hearing different Dharmas will arise necessarily. The sign of his entry is one speaks proudly “I made this request for this Dharma.” There isn’t an intellectual understanding because one has not understood the meaning. Because one understands empty words alone, one explains secret words in public. Despite whatever profound meaning is explained, one thinks “I have heard it before” and certain knowledge does not arise. One does not reach perfection in Dharma, that is a called a māra.  To subdue it, one must engage in hearing and contemplation as before again and again, and truly integrate the meaning of Dharma.

At that time, māra of seeking many qualities enters. Since one understands qualities, māra is disguised as benefactors and students. On their arrival, one doesn’t engage in practice. One becomes conceited about one’s learning, and one sees oneself as important. One becomes attached to wealth. Obstacles preventing one from traveling the path of Dharma are created. The method of subduing it is, stay in mountain retreat for a long time, and change all other activities which will not realize the Dharma.

At that time, the māra of tenets will arrive. Having arrived as a Dharma of five poisons with the biases of oneself and others, give up the jealousies of tenets, train in unbiased pure vision.

At that time, when meditating on the deity, the māra of having doubts about the deity enters. Concepts about taking and putting down the deity, and is it good or bad arise. [9/a] Wishing to subdue demons with power, with completing the approach, hurrying the activities, practicing subjugation and evil mantras, to tame the māra of animosity with the wisdom deity, whatever deity one meditates, do not meditate with or without characteristics, but develop only the inner radiance of awareness and be steady in one’s commitments of the three doors.

If one is freed from that māra, once again when one is meditating the channels and winds, the māra of introducing obstacles to practice arises, creating obstacles to spiritual practice, even slight suffering is unbearable. One stops that practice and later one is apprehensive of doing it. For that, meditate on the faults of samsara and one will be free from obstacles.

If one is free from that, again, enhancing great bliss, the dākinī māra arrives. Having accepted mantra, the woman bears children. Since one cannot care for them, various non-virtues occur. Cut the snares of attachment to her, what one does not have one needn’t protect.

If one is free from that, when meditating emptiness, the māra of emptiness arising as an enemy occurs. “Nothing is accomplished” and one confuses good deeds and misdeeds. One will have not faith in the Three Jewels. One will not arouse compassion for sentient beings. For that, one should increase virtue and purify misdeeds. One should train in pure vision, devoted faith, dependent origination and inseparable emptiness and compassion.

Further, the māra of compassion arising as an enemy is that without oneself being liberated one rushes to help migrating beings, and delay in accomplishment, etc., occurs. So to avoid that, develop aspirational bodhicitta and be relaxed about engaged bodhicitta.

If one is free from that, the māra of predictions arising as an enemy occurs. Impersonating one’s deity or Guru, when such predictions occur in one’s experience or in dreams as “Help migrating beings!” and “One will become accomplished if one has helped migrating beings”, etc., for that dissolve the wisdom being, if it remains clearly, it is the deity or Guru. But if it does not remain clearly, it is a māra and an obstacle. One should determine that with certainty.

If free from that, because the māra of ascetic conduct arises as an enemy, one wanders continually in towns, some are drunks, others show crazy behavior, others are lewd, behavior which is not correspond with the sublime Dharma occurs.  To counter act that, [10/a] stay in one place, meditate on candali, be impartial towards the eight dharmas.

Otherwise, the obstacles of māra while one has not obtained perfect Buddhahood are endless, and also the explanations which follow. Having given up material things, if one practices one pointedly, no kind of obstacle or māra will affect one.

As I posted earlier in this thread: Jamgon Kongtrul "Treasury of Knowledge: Book 1 'Myriad Worlds'" p.204:

What is the fundamental nature of the original, primordial ground of being, before buddhas appear by realizing it and before sentient beings appear by not realizing it? To answer this, the tradition of Great Perfection states that…
For those reading this that are not familiar with that particular book, it is Kongtrul's dissertation on the different cosmologies for the universe. He starts with Mt. Meru and the like, and ends up with a description of "how the universe is" from the Dzogchen perspective. The above quote would be hard to characterize as anything other than Great Madhyamaka/Shentong, and it is specifically predicated on Dzogchen. So I don't buy that he saw Dzogchen as being anything other than an "empty of other"/Great Madhyamaka/Shentong perspective.

Kongtrul is one authority. He is not the only authority. Other equally prestigious authorities disagree. That's 100% ok. The only "correct way to see it" is whatever way a qualified teacher decides a specific student needs to hear about it. I know of teachers that tell one student one thing and another student something else entirely. You're not going to get that kind of customized presentation here on the internet. But in any case, like it or not, the "empty of other" school of thought does exist within Tibetan philosophical tradition.

When this teacher is using the phrase "ground of being," is he simply using an inappropriate term to translate something (ka dag, say)?  Or do are you saying this is a symptom of a misunderstanding on this teacher's part--that he's slipped over into eternalism?

There is no "ground of being" described in any Buddhist text. The term is not appropriate in Buddhist discourse, and was imported into Dharma by mistake.

The term is a Christian theological term coined by Paul Tillich.

I wrote elsewhere on this site:

Unknown said:
In terms of the origins of the term, it was indeed coined by Tillich to show that "God must be called the infinite power of being which resists the threat of nonbeing." [Systematic Theology, Vol. pg. 64] You can see why such borrowing is tempting, "The ground of being has the character of self-manifestation; it has logos character" [Systematic Theology, Vol.1 pg. 158]

A large problem for people who are approaching Dzogchen is that they fall back into classical western philosophical categories. Indeed, Günther wrote once that Dzogchen essentially is not different than Parmenides's theory that whatever was contingent as non-being and whatever is permanent is being. Tillich writes:

"The Orphics, the Pythagoreans, Anaximander, Heraclitus, and Parmenides were driven to their philosophy by the awareness that the world they encountered lack ultimate reality. But only in Plato does the contrast between existential and the essential being become an ontological and ethical problem. Existence for Plato is the realm of mere opinion, error, and evil. It lacks true reality. True being is essential being and is present in the realm of eternal ideas, i.e., in essences. In order to reach essential being, man must rise above existence. He must return to the essential realm from which he fell into existence, In this way man's existence, is standing out of potentiality, is judged as a fall from what he essentially is. The potential is the essential, and to exist, i.e., to stand out of potentiality, is the lost of true essentiuality...In God there is no difference between essential and existential being. This implies the split is not ultimately valid and that is has no relevance for the ground of being itself. God is eternally what he is. [Systematic Theology, Vol.2 ppg. 21-22]

Examining this kind of presentation that the term "ground of being" arose out of, it is easy to see why those who are not trained in Indo-Tibetan scholastics as well as Western Philosophy will be very attracted to terms like "ground of being" in relationship to the term "basis" or gzhi.

Samayas don't change just because the teachings are brought from one culture to another — for example, the samayas did not change their character because Tibetans imported Vajrayāna from India. Therefore, we should not expect them to be mutable just because we live in the West.

Samayas are something taught in the tantras. Regardless of what others may do, I encourage people to follow them according to how they have been understood.

This may not be entirely related, but Alexander Brezin says in his web archive that if one disparages ones teacher or breaks up with him/her in a negative way (negative way: not keeping polite distance, but just running away with remorse) then it can cause autoimmunological diseases,mental and physical suffering.

Son of Buddha said:
Oh your right my bad I posted the wrong thing......


Queen Srimala Sutra
13. Intrinsic Purity of the Mind

"Lord, samsára is based on the Tathágata-garbha. It was with reference to the Tathágata-garbha that the Lord pointed out and explained, '[It is] without limit in the past.' Since there is the Tathágata-garbha, there is reason for speaking of 'cyclical flow' (samsára).

Therefore the Tathágata-garbha is the support, the holder, the base of constructed [Buddha natures] that are non-discrete, not dissociated, and knowing as liberated from the stores [of defilement]; and furthermore is the support, the holder, the base of external constructed natures that are discrete, dissociated, and knowing as not liberated.

Malcolm wrote:
Samsara does not equal conditioned phenomena. Why? Because if it did, there could be no pure conditioned phenomena such as path dharmas. People frequently confuse these two things much to their detriment. In other words, all conditioned phenomena are impermanent, but not all conditioned phenomena are impure.

Furthermore, indeed all conditioned phenomena are intrinsically pure, and it is just this intrinsic purity of the mind that sutras refer to as tathagātatagarbha. It is this purity which is the basis for all buddhaqualities. Translating "atma" as "self" in this context is a misfortunate error when in fact the term simply means "nature" in this context as numerous usages prove. Tagathāgarbha is indeed pure, permanent, blissful, and a nature, but it is not a thing per se., it it also not a "self" and using that term and applying too tathāgatagarbha is just confusing. Further, claiming it is source of impure conditioned phenomena is also a category error. On the other hand, rhetorically samsara can be "based" on tathāgatagarbha since the non-recognition of one's real state does result on wandering in samsara.

Could you clarify its meaning for us?

Malcolm wrote:
From a version of introduction to my forthcoming book:

dzogchungpa said:
...the generic basis [spyi gzhi], which is initially defined by Vimalamitra in the section on the nidānas as “one’s own unfabricated mind” [rang sems ma bcos pa]. This crucial point made in the text should not be ignored, for it would appear that Vimala’s stance contradicts the modern tendency to interpret the generic basis as a transpersonal entity of some kind, leading to the proposition that “the universe is an intelligent entity” and so on.

Malcolm wrote:
And:

dzogchungpa said:
...what is intended by the term “original basis” [ye gzhi] is a pristine empty cognizance or nous. By the use of the term ye shes as a key descriptor for the basis, Dzogchen texts are referring to a noetic potentiality of consciousness which is innate even when defined as “originally pure” or empty, for otherwise it would become very difficult to account for the arising of buddhas and sentient beings in the second topic, the arising of delusion.

Malcolm wrote:
And:

dzogchungpa said:
The third hard question is the issue of the temporality of the basis. Since time does not apply to the original basis, we must regard the use of terms such as “original,” “primordial” and so on as indicating a state in which time is irrelevant, rather than an actual conventional historical epoch or starting point existing countless infinities of eons ago. From such a perspective the placing of the original basis on a temporal spectrum is therefore a didactic myth. The net effect of this understanding is that the basis is the state of phenomena as they appear, in that all phenomena, both external and internal, appear out of an empty noetic potential.

Malcolm wrote:
And

dzogchungpa said:
Having defined the basis, what is being described is a description of reality just as it is. Buddhas are those who unerringly recognize this, and specifically, the idealized buddha known as Samantabhadra recognizes this not only in absence of a teacher, but without ever becoming a sentient being.

Malcolm wrote:
And:

dzogchungpa said:
The third topic defines sugatagarbha as no other than the basis present in sentient beings. In other words, the sugatagarbha defines how the basis is instantiated in sentient beings, and how vidyā exists in the body.

Malcolm wrote:
And:

dzogchungpa said:
Only the seventh position is considered to be flawless, in that the basis is defined as “great originally purity” (ka dag chen po):
Dharmatā, original purity, is free from all proliferation. Since it is unaffected by ignorance, it is free from all obscurations.

Malcolm wrote:
In reality, the basis really just refers to the union of the two truths:

The Mahāyānapathakrama by Subhagavajra states:
dzogchungpa said:
So called “tantras” are tantras because of connection, and further, because they connected the basis, the method and the result. When divided, there are two kinds— tantras of words and tantras of meaning. Words are sounds. There are three in meaning— the tantra of the basis, the tantra of method and the tantra of the result. Now then, the tantra of the basis is the nature of the two truths; the method is the two stages; and the result is the two kaȳas, the dharmakāya and rūpakāya. Therefore, since the result is obtained when the method is cultivated in dependence on the basis, a tantra is so called because it connects.

I don't think the point is particularly to change Nichols' or Sperling's mind, I think the point is to have a published correction in a reputable source that is accessible to everyone. Plenty of people would be persuaded by this.

Yes it is.  If the academics get something egregiously wrong it is in fact the job of translators and Dharma teachers to correct the issue.  You could publish a paper in something like the Journal of Buddhist Ethics along with a few other translators/Western Dharma teachers. Or you could write an article concerning the misinterpretation and publish it in a magazine like Tricycle.  But this kind of misinterpretation needs to be addressed.

Sorry Kirt, but no. Here is why -- I spent years correcting Dogyal advocates and so no — did I convince anyone of anything? No.

Further, in order to correct someone like the writer of the op-ed, I would have to explain too many details, many of which are bound by samaya (for exampe, how to explain to an outsider the ritual language of extreme violence found in so many protector petitions?).

And as far as correcting Sperling goes, that also is just a waste of time since he won't listen.

Hi,

i got a jenang for an Six armed Mahakala from Rinchen Terdzo (ThukChen Pema GyuTrul Drawa Cycle, not Shangpa Chagdrupa) and thought this should be an Mahayoga/Anuttarayoga empowerment.
On Himalayanart.com there is mentioned that Six armed Mahakala is a Kriyayogatantra practice, which would mean that there a very different commitments for practicing/reciting the Mantra.

Can you help me with some info? Do i need to be vegetarian for reciting the Mantra? Or are there no commitments with jenang?

Best wishes
Chris

According to Sperling it is 5DL's report of the instructions that he sent to a military force directing them to attack Tsang. Hard to see how that is purely rhetorical.

Malcolm wrote:
It is not such a letter. It is a letter of petition to Tsi'u dmar po to quell disturbances in Tsang.

It states:

"Pleased to composed a letter of vajra words of the Yakṣa Tsi'u dmar po,the general of the arrogant ones appointed by the great master of Glorious Oddiyāna, the union of all the buddhas, as the protector of the doctrine and the profound treasures in the valleys surrounded by the Himalayas, headed by the temple of Zab Yangs Migyur Lhundrup (Samye)..."

It ends with:

"Please pacify all the negativities of this time such as the illness, wars and famines 
of Pur rgyal and Tibet, and increase happiness, 
fully increase the doctrine of scripture and realization,

etc.

As I said, these lines are rhetorical.

This kind of scholarship is very irresponsible on Sperling's part.

Greg said:
It certainly looks less bad if it is in fact a supplication to a dharmapāla and not an actual directive to smash babies off of rocks. And that is certainly extremely sneaky and misleading of Sperling to phrase things the way he did. But the fact that he actually did orchestrate a military campaign is probably enough for Kristof's point to stand.

Malcolm wrote:
By 1660 (the date of the above cited letter), the Fifth was firmly in control of Tibet.

Sperling conflates two distinct epochs in the Fifth's life, disturbances in Tsang that also tally with disturbances caused by Dogyal, and the events of Tsang war in 1640.

Moreover, Sperling does not state to whom he sent these instructions, but it is clear when the letter is read in full it was sent to Tsi'u dmar. Now of course it is too late, because this misinformation now shows up on many web sites.

In 1640, he was only 23 and fully controlled by the regent, Sonam Chophel, who waged war against the King of Tsang in the Fifth's name.

Most of oil in Iraq is controlled by Kurds or Shiites, that is all there is to it.

Son of Buddha said:
Even the oil fields in shiite area DO NOT BELONG to the shiites, the oil is ran through a PIPELINE, to oil refineries to be processed from benzine for commercial use these refineries are almost exclusivly under sunni control.. Saddam set it up this way to keep the Sunnis in control of everything.

The actual refined product never touches shiite hands..........even the crude oil never touches shiite hands cause it goes down the pipeline to the Sunnis.
Which is why the largest oil refinery in Iraq is the Bajji oil refinery in Sunni control.

Malcolm wrote:
The Shiites control that oil, and that is a fact. It is how the Iraqi Gvt. (Shiite) makes its money. The refinery you mention? Also controlled by Iraqi Gvt. until a few months ago.

A reasonable exit from iraq was given and he didnt blow it, Iraq was stable for many years and they were properly set up to take care of themselves........ the fact is the blame rests solely on the Iraqi Gov, which has a 250,000 standing Army with tanks, heavy armored vehicles and airforce, and yet they lost half their country to 5000 invaders with pick up trucks.

Malcolm wrote:
Obama did blow it, he did not listen to his advisors for political reasons (responding to the American populace's war fatigue); the Iraqi Gvt. was and is a joke, and the proof of this is that the Iraqi's let go of half of Iraq to a brigade of bandits in pickup trucks.


Son of Buddha said:
Your joking right?
It doesnt matter what advisors told Obama cause Mr Obama was only responding to the Iraq goverment demand that all American troops be out of their country by 2011, only thing Obama did was accept the Iraqi goverments demands for FULL sovereignty and the end of all US occupation of Iraq......... of course this also worked out for Obama cause he got to play it off as if he was the one who caused all of the american troops to be brought home.When in fact it was the Iraqi govs demands.

Yes the Iraqi gov is weak..... But they are a sovereign nation and it was about time the US treated them like one........... THEIR elected gov as a sovereign nation voted and said we want all american troops out of our country by 2011......... it doesnt matter if it was right or wrong choice....it was their choice....and it was about time for their choice to be honored

The vast majority of the oil fields are the northern sunni triangle, the southern oil fields in the shiite areas have their oil ran trough pipelines that must be sent to the northern refineries for processing...........hence the largest oil refinery in Iraq is the Sunni controlled Bajji oil refinery on route cherry near what was FOB Summeral.
