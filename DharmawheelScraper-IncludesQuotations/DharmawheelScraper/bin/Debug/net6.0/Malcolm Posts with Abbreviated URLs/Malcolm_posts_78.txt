At least your prospective Guru must have a good education in secret mantra; that implies he has a good education in sutra. Sometimes, even a realized person is not necessarily a good teacher, more like pratyekabuddhas than bodhisattvas.

Namdrol,

You advised me to do Vajrasattva before and so I'm trying to do it. I am going to combine this in a Short Tun style of practice. After breathings, guru yoga, 5 elements purification and refuge, I will visualize Vajrasattva on my head in typical way and chant 100-syllable mantra many times, imagining myself filling with white light (nectar) and all negativities draining out. After the Vajrasattva portion, I will sing the Song of Vajra and after that perhaps Six Lokas practice and then dedicate merits.

Does that sound like a good practice to you?

Vajrasattva mantra is shown on page 123 of the newer Tun and Ganapuja book. Note the last line. Is that last line just for ganapuja or do you end all Vajrasattva mantras with this on the very last repetition?  I also have an audio of this from downloading the mandarava ganapuja, so I know how to say the mantra the correct way.

This issue is not as prevalent among Tibeans that are bilingual in Hindi. In this case, their preference for fricatives is learned, rather than innate.

This doesn't seem logical - if they had just transliterated directly (using Tibetan ca cha ja for the same syllables in Sanskrit), it would have been just as effective in differentiating Sanskrit text since tsa tsha dza don't exist in Sanskrit.  Why would the early transliterators deliberately complicate things?

Malcolm wrote:
Because the Tibetan ca and Sanskrit ca sound different.

ཅ་ཆ་ཇ are tonal, in descending order. Sanskrit ca cha ja are not tonal, since Sanskrit is not a tonal language (a point Sapan makes very clear). Thonmi Sambhota wanted to make sure that Tibetans who were reading mantras were not to prounce ca cha ja the same way they were pronouncing ཅ་ཆ་ཇ. This lead to other problems, of course, later on.

Kevin - I'm curious what your opinion is then, for mantras found in earth terma - for example, the sanskrit syllable "ca" will be found in Tibetan as "tsa", so you actually have "tsitta" vs. "citta."  should we go back to sanskrit pronunciation in such cases, even though the written terma appeared with Tibetan misspelling of sanskrit words?  This is confusing!

Namdrol said:
It is not a Tibetan mispelling.

The Tibetans deliberately employed tsa tsha dza to represent the Sanskrit ca cha and ja to differentiate Sanskrit words from Tibetan words. Thus, we are to understand that tsa tsha dza are to be pronounced ca cha and ja hence ཙིཏཏ་ should never be transliterated tsitta into English, it should only be transliterated "citta" since that is what is intended.

dakini_boi said:
How would using tsa tsha dza serve to differentiate Sanskrit words from Tibetan?  After all, the Tibetan language uses these syllables as well.

If the Sakyapa tradition is to pronounce everything according to Sanskrit, then take the Vajrakilaya mantra - there are three words which in normal transliteration (both Tibetan and Roman) start with B.  Do Sakyapas then pronounce these all with V?

Thank you, Namdrol.  As usual, your expertise is most appreciated.

Well, we have a lot of evidence.

One, there is a text by Sakya Pandita that describes very well how Indians in different regions of India such as central India and Kashmir pronounced Sanskrit -- and he was personally acquainted with 30 panditas.

Two, Indians in the described regions still pronounce Sanskrit in the manner in which Sapan says they did 800 years ago.

Three, pronunciation of Sanskrit is a major obsession with Brahmins since the proper pronunciation of the Vedas and vedic rites is considered crucial for their effectiveness. The similarities and (minor) differences in Sanskrit pronunciation between different brahmin traditions in India is well understood and mapped.

Four, changes in pronunciation can be accurately mapped mathematically (and are). I am sure you have encountered structural linguistics. I am not arguing that everything Sausurre said is true, but there are regular rules to phonetic shifts in Indo-europoean lanaguages and nothing in the Indian subcontinent that makes a sibilant ṣ or ś shift to a fricative kh possible.

The regularity with which Tibetans mispronounce both ṣ and ś when they are present in the middle of Sanskrit words indicates this is a pronunciation that is not an Indo-European language issue and instread is a Tibetan linguistic issue -- for example, I have heard Tibetans mispronounce kośa (kosha, mispronounced "kokha") with the same regularity as they mispronounce aṣṭa (saying "akha") or say Bhekhenze for Bhaiṣajye. In other words, mono-lingual Tibetans have a hard time pronouncing sibilants present in the middle of words since in Tibetan there are no sibilants present in the middle of a word. A Tibetan who has no problem pronouncing "bud shing" (firewood, and two separate words) will mispronounce kośa everytime unless they have received specific Sanskrit training.

Why, because presumably the mantra was communicated to a Tibeten who pronounced kili as chili, there is no logical reason why a mantra transmitted by a Tibetan as chili pronounced kili will not be equally as effective (especially since it is the original pronunciation). You are arguing that it only one way i.e. Tibetans can mispronounce mantras and gain siddhi. But we cannot. This is foolish.

There is absolutely no fault in restoring the proper pronunciation. No blessings are lost, no sacred "power" is lost. In this respect I completely disagree with anyone who says one must recite mantras according to manner in which one's teacher pronounces them if that manner is not consistent with the rules of Sanskrit pronunciation. It is illogical to maintain this position. It is basically an argument for blind faith. In this respect, in my opinion, Sakya Paṇḍita's position is best.

Hi, I've suffered from vatta imbalances for most of my life.  I've taken a number of  measures to help balance it including massage oil, which was an excellent recommendation.  My question is my vatta has usually manifested as nervousness, agitation, lethargy and fatigue when I expend too much energy and physical problems such as stiffness, dryness, aches, headaches, spinal discomfort, and very brittle bones, also irregularity of breathing.  Sadness and depression have never really been an issue with me, save for a few months when I was about 15 or 16.  Sometimes my outlook can be a little negative or dismal, at times.  Sometimes I don't have a lot of "get up and go" and lack some enthusiasm for making money and stuff like that.  I could be totally wrong but I usually right it off as a lack of ojas because of constitution, diet and lifestyle.  Is this is what is meant by sadness or depression in vatta imbalances because I am sure I have had vatta, but do not experience "depression" per say?   What I am asking is, if I have vatta how come I am not depressed, or does my slight lack of get up and go, nervousness and so forth, sometimes slightly dismal attitude, count as "depression"?  I mean, I do smile a lot.

This was exactly my point. The questions you raised are exactly those that I have. You took the words out of my mouth. You see, I am trying to put myself in the shoes of a Buddhist and then switch the view and put myself in the shoes of a practitioner of Sanatana Dharma (commonly known in the West as Hinduism).

I want to examine things from all possible angles - or at least as many of them as possible - in order to reach deeper understanding.

Of course, this has its limits. You cannot go on examining till you are old and on the verge of dying. My aim is to do things correctly. I would not like to become some confused, half-baked New Age Buddhist, if I do fully commit to Buddhadharma. Things simply have to fit.

narraboth said:
depends on what you mean for 'sutras'. I think we call Tara tantra 'sutra' in China... no matter what we still chant tare mantra.
Amoghapasa is a tantra, Manjusri root tantra is a tantra, they are all huge texts, and many other 'tantras'...
People, especially chinese buddhists, chant many of them without even LUNG, and there are many signs of 'siddhis'.

Yes, there is a line saying 'without initiation, getting siddhi is like pressing oil from sands'. but I don't think it can be understood as you won't be benefited by simply reciting mani, tare tu tare, vajra guru, arapachana.... at least i haven't heard any tibetan lama suggested that. (Tibetan themselves don't worry this)
Most of lama indicate that so-called practice in that saying is strictly tantric practice such as two stages. A senior Gelug-Nyingma master said as long as you don't do self generation, you can visualise dieties in front and chant mantra, it's not a problem that you haven't got initiation. There are also many similar teachings.

Malcolm wrote:
The mani is a dharani, so here is a sutra system for chanting it. Arapacana is also from sutra.

The tantras you are mentioning are so called "kalpa" tantras, sections of sutra that are also classfied as kriya tantra, so again, no contradiction. Most of the mantras that Chinese people are chanting are from sutra or dharani texts. Many of these were also translated from Chinese into Tibetan.

But this will not work with Vajrakilaya, etc. You must have the transmission.

Medicine Buddha, Tara, etc., kriya deities from the Buddha and Lotus families may not require intiation (but that depends too), but mantras from the Vajra family of Kriya tantra definitely require initiation since they are connected with controlling Guhyakas.

Inseparability = tathāgatatagarbha.

According to the Sakya masters, ālaya has two aspects -- its ultimate truth aspect is the dharmadhātu; its relative truth aspect is the  ālayavijñāna. Because the ultimate nature of the ālaya is the dharmadhātu, nirvana is possible. Because the relative truth aspect of the ālaya is ālayavijñāna, samsara is possible. Since the two truths are inseparable, samsara and nirvana are inseparable.

Hence the special Sakya view is well known as 'khor 'das dbyer med, the inseparability of samsara and nirvana. Sūtra inseparability of samsara and nirvana may be found in the Heart Sūtra. The tantric view of inseparability of samsara and nirvana may be found in the Hevajra tantra.

This is not how the Sakya master formulate their idea of the ālaya.

Following Sakya Pandita, Gorampa, in the first section of his three vows commentary, very clearly shows that clarity cannot be tathāgatagarbha since it is conditioned; and emptiness cannot be tathāgatagarbha, since it is the extreme of cessation.

Tathāgatagarbha, according to the standard, orthodox Sakya view is the inseparabilty of clarity and emptiness.

I am asking all this, because of a particular interest in some Shaiva tantric teachings connected with kayasadhana.

Still in one of these Tantras it is mentioned that without having bhakti towards Shiva his Grace cannot descend and grant the siddhi in these particular sadhanas.

Is bhakti towards Shiva incompatible with simultaneously taking refuge in the Buddha as a practitioner of Vajrayana? Keeping again in my mind the adherence also to all other elements of Buddhadharma i.e. the anatman-doctrine, dependent origination, etc.

As I see it, there is nothing particularly wrong with writing a book about knife-fighting techniques. Not to my taste, but not illegal. Certainly I know a lot of Buddhists (including famous contemporary teachers) that are totally into weapons -- guns, knives, swords, you name it.

Basically, how Buddhist is it to put someone in jail? Bodhisattvas are supposed to free people from shackles, not place them in shackles. Bodhisattvas should exercise patience and restraint, not engage in systematic group smear campaigns.

In other words, I said he has some interesting things to say on his blog -- you come back with all this heavy stuff about why this is terrible. If Cassidy was just some schmuck claming to be a tulku and writing a blog, we wouldn't give any of this a second thought -- it would be at best a minor disagreement. But because he has a record, and he tangled with a wealthy religious organization, he is being screwed to the wall, and this is taking on much more of a life than it really deserves.

I have a dispassionate view about this. No one is better than anyone else. Everyone has done something frak up, either in this life or another. Cassidy has an army of people who hate him and talk shit about him.

Considering that the supreme court recently ruled that a man making death threats against Obama could not be jailed because the threats were not credible, and therefore covered under free speech protections, I don't think the prosecution in Maryland has a chance of landing this, especialy since the EFF is involved. And they have deep pockets.

I think I see what you mean Namdrol, if you mean that 'wishing to give up suffering' is aspirational and 'being free from the three poisons' is the result. They certainly are two entirely different things.

Regarding the aspirational aspect of "nges 'byung", you wrote earlier: It is necessary to have a mind that has given up attachment to samsara in order to practice tantra, otherwise, there is no point.
To what extent would this mind have needed to give up attachment?

I'm thinking that if it's not given up enough, then it's going to slide right back into the trap it wishes to escape from. On the other hand, if it has deeply ascertained suffering within the three poisons and has developed a revulsion towards them it could pass a point where it no longer wishes (or is able) to employ tantric means. Dechen Norbu describes it as "a fight fire with fire situation", which implies that nges 'byung relies on attachment to samsara, to some extent at least.

Is this a fair conclusion?

Malcolm wrote:
Giving up attachment to samsara means that you do not want to take afflictive rebirth here anymore. If you practice tantra, it is because you realize that afflictions are too strong to make the path of renunciation of sense objects feasible, since instead you work with sense objects on the path.

Thanks Dechen,
I was coming at it from a slightly different angle. Let me give an example - say food, there's stuff we like and stuff we don't. If we have a choice we choose the stuff we like. The 'not wanting' the other food must be similar to a renounced mind which does not want desire - perhaps has already seen the drawbacks involved.

How do you get such a mind to start working with something it no longer has any wish for at all? If, on the other hand, it still had some desire, then it would not be the right mind for tantra, as Namdrol has pointed out.

Then the premise of Dzogchen is just the observation that all you ever 'know' is a projection of your mind. But everyone knows this, no? Its perceptual theory. It's called the "epistemological problem" in Western philosophy, i.e, its a problem, not a solution. And conceding as a result of this that nothing can be known beyond the originator of this internal structure (the mind) is called 'solipsism'. Conceding instead that things can be known beyond the mind is called realism, and the only thing I understand about Dzogchen is that it is neither. So what am I missing?

I want to know how the mountain got there. The texts say, "the mountain originates from the mind". Either I read this as a kind of idealist idea, or I read it as a merely perceptual idea. Apparently neither is correct.

There appears to be some inconsistency between theory of evolution of humans from primates and Mahayana Buddhism. Basically, in Buddhism it takes minimum three 'countless' kalpas to reach Buddhahood. Every sentient requires at least that period of time to reach Buddhahood including our very Buddha Shakyamuni. But did we even exist so long ago?

There are stories of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas of many eons ago, but weren't we primates at that time?

What is the explanation of this inconsistency? Is it that when these sutras talk about civilizations many many kalpas ago, they are actually referring to another 'world-cycle' where sentient beings rose and then destroyed?

Huifeng said:
It is not an inconsistency, the problem is one of understanding what Buddhism (Mahayana or otherwise) teaches on the subject.
Add to your formulations that there are multiple worlds, and that there are multiple forms of existence in which living beings can be reborn, some of which entailing lifespans of millions of years.

So, "did we even exist so long ago?" - Yes.  Just not necessarily as human beings.  Or even on planet earth.
For "weren't we primates at that time?" - Who is this "we"?  Maybe some were, but others may have been humans or devas elsewhere.

I had just finished reading Tyler Dewar’s (@tylerdewar on Twitter) recent interview in Bodhi Magazine with the 17th Karmapa. There was a graph in which His Holiness discussed the importance of sangha [community] as a harmonious coming together. Nalanda West, Seattle, Washington (@NalandaWest), had tweeted a link to the interview, and I re-tweeted it to share with the people who follow my Twitter stream.


Then I asked the question, “What does His Holiness mean?” and people began to chime in to discuss what they thought. Much to my surprise Jetsuma chimed in with “Consistency.” I tweeted back “What do you mean?”…

…and the sh*t storm began. Maybe I missed something, but she called me an asshole and made a snide remark about my heart, which gave her devoted Kunzang Palyul Ling followers the green light to begin attacking me.

I laughed it off and mentioned it in my last Elephant Journal article—“I’m an asshole, but that’s beside the point”—and returned to my daily routine of practice and tweeting Dharma quotes and music during session breaks without giving it a second thought. I had no idea of the Twitter hell I was about to catch.

From the point of my initial exchange with Jetsuma, the attacks escalated from strangers ridiculing the fact that I’m dying of congestive heart failure to a personal threat—“I know people in Chicago”—from one of her devoted followers. I’ve always known that the Nyingma have had issues surrounding Penor Rinpoche recognizing the “actor” Steven Seagal as a tulku, but I had no idea what a pile of sh*t I had stepped into.

Thankfully, Twitter isn’t a message board, and I can block Jetsuma’s followers from seeing my Twitter stream. I’ve had to block only one person who created a shell account to spam my @Replies (Twitter inbox) with threatening messages. Why would a Dharma teacher on Twitter allow her or his followers to behave in such a shameful manner? Perhaps she didn’t know. I haven’t a clue.

Ending on a positive note…Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche (@ponlop) has followed me back; he wasn’t following anyone on Twitter when I wrote my last article. We’ve been exchanging direct messages (private tweets); he enjoyed “Bite Me, Boulder Buddhists” and mentoring me through the process of dying.

Also, Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche (@yongeymingyurrinpoche) is on Twitter now, but has yet to tweet.

What about Twitter hell? My bad; it ended in a tweet. “Founding member Chicago KTC, well regarded over 28 years, will not hesitate to take legal action against anyone stating otherwise here.” And so while we can “drive all blames into ourselves,” as the Lojong slogan goes—and while I remember to be grateful to my “enemies,” who are my greatest teacher—well, Twitter hell turned out to be for those deluded enough to think they could push Bill Schwartz around.

Crimes & Tulkus: Poisonous Snakes in Buddhist Robes
Some people have asked me if I’m the “man named Andrew Wilson” that a certain tulku is mentioning on her Web site as having had his house searched by the FBI for evidence relating to the purported crimes of another man named “William Cassidy,” aka "Tenpa Rinpoche." I am that Andrew Wilson. But I don’t know anything about any cyberstalking crimes by a William Cassidy.

I do know something about being criminally cyberstalked, however, because for almost a whole year two saffron-robed psychopaths stalked me (although I’d blocked them and all their ilk) through various both official and anonymous Twitter accounts and through anonymous hate blogs on which they posted many of my Zen/Taoist “tweets” accompanied by the most outrageously foolish, not to mention slanderous, commentary.

According to these two "Buddhist" stalkers -- a crazy looking lady wearing a crown and too much make-up and a mousy little man in monk's robes -- my Twitter page was actually authored by William Cassidy, and the various different handles and avatars I went through to try to get clear of their relentlessly negative attentions were all William Cassidy’s “sock puppets,” and my insistence on remaining anonymous behind names like “Akebonojishi” and “Mujinkyo” was all by itself absolute and conclusive proof that I must really be Tenpa Rinpoche trying to pull a fast one on the whole world. It seems not to have occurred to these racketeering co-frauds that my insistence on anonymity was precisely a way of trying to keep the emphasis off my "self" and on what I have to say (about Zen). But logic has never been the strong suit of religious fanatics.

So incensed were the two bizarre and unwholesome Bogus-sattvas by my continued presence on Twitter that last spring and summer they resorted to harassing almost every single Twitter user who RTd or even spoke to me. Many of the people they harassed got quite spooked by it, so it became almost impossible at times for me to reach anyone with my notes and comments on Zen/Haragei. (A pity, since the techniques I show people how to do actually work, and nobody even has to pay to support my lavish Guru lifestyle.) They particularly swarmed, attacked and mocked anyone who dared to call me "Sensei" or thanked me for helping out with a specific problem. Their paranoia rose to an obsessive crescendo of mean-spirited ridicule and tiresome victim-babble that was endlessly echoed and amplified by a beggar's chorus of the organization's so-called nuns, each with her own Twitter page devoted to singing the Guru's praises and savaging the Guru's purported enemies.

I've never experienced any Internet madness quite like it. The threatening rage and vituperation on open display from a rural Maryland rattler's nest of "Vajrayana Buddhists" was surreal, David Lynch-esque even. Many of the tweets were disturbing, threatening messages hinting obscurely at magical attacks, promising the most extreme karmic retribution, and prophesying a long stay in Vajra Hell. But there were also more routine threats of the "we-know-where-you-live" and "we-have-people-on-the-payroll-who-take-care-of-people-like-you" variety. (The "Mafia" style tweets felt especially dissonant coming from smiling nuns.) Naturally, I've already downloaded hundreds of pages of this stupefying horse-shit from Twitter and Google caches, and will be making it available to the right people as and when needed.

Those same two unbelievably sad, bewildered and angry co-conspirators now claim that even though it has been proven beyond any possible doubt that I was not, as they swore up down and sideways to everyone who would listen (including the FBI), William Cassidy himself, still I must somehow be connected to the man, who is sitting in jail right now -- and they publish their ignorant, libelous opinion about a person unknown to them along with my name on the official blog of their purported Sangha. Psychopath that she is, the tulku in question still often mentions me and sometimes RTs my tweets mockingly on her Twitter page, never mind that she is now and always has been "blocked," and uses the same type of inflammatory language about me she did all last year. Neither the mentally deranged tulku nor the emotionally and intellectually stunted monk capo have yet acknowledged any error in judgement, nor offered the barest hint of an apology. However, at some point they did quietly remove every last scrap of the "hard evidence" supposedly proving that I am William Cassidy they'd posted on their anonymous "Protecting Nyingma" attack blog. Huh! I wonder why they would do that!

The Deadly Viper Assassination Cult Buddhists
I've been posting Zen notes, poems and aphorisms on Twitter since the summer of 2009. In December of that year, two very strange people began cyberstalking and harassing me through multiple Web sites and multiple (mostly anonymous) Twitter accounts. Their names are Alyce Zeoli -- aka "Jetsunma Ahkon Lhamo," the controversial "founder and spiritual director" of an organization called the Kunzang Palyul Choling -- and David Williams, a so-called monk in that same purportedly Buddhist organization.

The reason for these two weird people cyberstalking me, and relentlessly harassing anybody with whom I interacted on Twitter, is still mysterious. Although they often claimed that since my Twitter account was anonymous (as it was at the time, though clearly not anymore) I must have something to hide, and therefore was beyond any possible doubt an enemy of theirs named "William Cassidy" aka Tenpa Rinpoche, they also spent an inordinate amount of time and energy trying to argue with, contradict and debunk me on matters of Zen and "Buddhism." (Note: even now that they must know I'm not him, they still regularly mention and "retweet" my postings with mocking and derisory comments attached. Strange!)

Unfortunately, I did not take their many threats seriously enough, and failed to contact the police.

However, these two mentally disturbed people did not fail to collect any and every annoyed or exasperated counter-tweet of mine, some of them containing what might be considered by drawing room standards moderately rough language, though not so much so for the Internet, and these tweets they forwarded to the FBI with a complaint that I was cyberstalking Alyce Zeoli -– a person I'd never even heard about until the first of her childish insults appeared on my Twitter stream, and a person I truly wish I’d never had the displeasure of hearing about.

Naturally, the two bizarre individuals in question neglected to inform the FBI about their own incessantly negative and provocative, often quite creepy, online activities against me and a few unlucky others. However, I've since downloaded hundreds of pages from Twitter and Google caches documenting just this. I expect to soon be making all of this puerile, repugnant cult material available for easy perusal by anyone with the patience and the stomach for it.

The FBI's research department must be slacking off, because as a result of Alyce Zeoli's complaint a team of FBI agents in dark clothing broke into my Oregon home before dawn on the morning of February 15th, 2011 and handcuffed my girlfriend and I at gunpoint. This was rather traumatic for my girlfriend, who had no idea what was going on. Actually, I didn't either. The agents then read out a search warrant for our computer equipment and cell phones and questioned us both on the cheerful joint topic of "Jetsunma Ahkon Lhamo" and "William Cassidy." They also spent an inordinate amount of time searching the basement and greenhouse, as if they hoped to find explosives or a maybe a cache of Tommy guns. I told them they were raiding the wrong compound; they must have taken a wrong turn at Albequerque, because where they really belonged was the Kunzang Palyul Choling enclave in Maryland. They informed me that the FBI agent who filed the affidavit leading to the armed invasion of my home is based, surprise, in Baltimore.

I later learned that on that very same morning William Cassidy was arrested in California and transported to Baltimore. He has apparently been sitting in the federal wing of a maximum security prison ever since, with motions for a trial on charges of "cyberstalking" Alyce Zeoli, who -- ironically -- out of her many absurd aliases and honorifics will perhaps become best known as the "Victim 1" of court documents, scheduled for this fall. (See U.S. vs. Cassidy.)

Leaving aside notable constitutional issues, the government's whole case seems to hinge on the wild claim that Alyce Zeoli is a "victim" of cyberstalking and harassment via Twitter and various Websites run by William Cassidy. But if Alyce Zeoli and David Williams did online to William Cassidy and to others (me, just for example) precisely what they claim he did to her, the case falls apart like a gin-soaked cocktail napkin. "No crime, with no victim;/no jury will convict him."

And the truth is that these two Kunzang Palyul Choling players at one time or another mocked, stalked, harassed, or insulted every single one my friends on Twitter. Alyce Zeoli is renowned both on- and offline for her tantrums and high handed arrogance, as well as for her belittling response to the merest criticisms; while David Williams is infamous for rude, persistent, laughably obtuse attacks on all who don't fall in line with his Guru's bizarre pronouncements. If William Cassidy deserves to be sitting in a jail in Maryland awaiting trial, then clearly Alyce Zeoli and David Williams deserve to be sitting in jail in Oregon awaiting trial also. Since when does the federal government arbitrarily take sides in Internet flame wars?

I never saw William Cassidy cyberstalk anybody so I can't pronounce on that subject, but I can say this: Alyce Zeoli and David Williams are cyberstalkers extraordinaire –- and by deliberately misleading the federal government in their wildly successful attempt to put my life in danger and to deprive me of all civil, political and human rights, they’ve downgraded their profile to felonious liars and co-conspiring domestic terrorists. Eventually, one can hope, the federal government will wake up to their vicious act, soon after which cell doors will clang shut on these two smiling, saffron-robed vipers.

xylem said:
I have been studying Perfect Conduct, Dudjom Rinpoche's commentary on Ngari Panchen Pema Wangyal's Ascertaining the Three Vows.  There is one section that has always perplexed me.  In the section on the pratimoksha-vinaya, on p. 26, the last full paragraph, section 2.b.1(a.3.3) section (2) the root text says:

An upholder of lay ordination who is also a pure-awareness holder must, except for the signs and rituals of complete ordination, practice all that remains.

Dudjom Rinpoche follows:

An upholder of lay Buddhist ordination who has entered mantra becomes known as a pure-awareness holder, or a vidyadhara.  Although it is not necessary for such an individual to display the outer signs of full ordination such as robes, begging bowl, or shaved hair-- which are the result of receiving a specific ritual-- all remaining precepts in the vinyaya system must be upheld and practiced.

This has always perplexed me because at first it has seemed in resonance with Guru Rinpoche's teaching to rise with the view while descending with the conduct.  On the other hand I have yet to find a context where the vinaya and it's particular forms of discipline and purification ( e.g. sojong) have been encouraged for lay tantrikas.  At the same time, looking at the lives of great lay masters, such as Chatral Rinpoche, they certainly do seem to embrace the whole scope of the vinaya, even as lay practitioners.

Thoughts?

Malcolm wrote:
This is not definite. First of all, there are is no rite by which an upasaka receives all these vows of a bhikṣu. Therefore, there is no onus to guard vows which has not taken, as Dudjom Rinpoche readily admits.

Instead we can regard this as an instruction that lay practitioners ought, in an ideal world, to emulate the discplined behavior of a buddhist monk.

Incidentally, this instruction is rejected in the earlier Three Vows of Sapan.

This is a very interesting discussion. It is a very important discussion. Please allow a possibility that there actually is buddhahood in one life. Please consider that the powers gained on the bhumis as described in sutras are inspirational. The actual realizations and samadhis that happen on the bhumis or that a buddha has are completely beyond description and can only be referenced metaphorically. The realization of nonconceptual wisdom is possible even in a day or a week. Chan does not possess this method. Vajrayana does.

Then the matter of attaining omniscience is a gradual process. Because the obstacles to omniscience are in one's elements, one has to remain in nonconceptual wisdom 24/7 for a long time, then sometime around death wisdom throws off the veil of the elements. Vajrayana has methods that make this certain. Chan does this potentially but without the specific method, it won't be as certain.

Jnana said:
You've re-emphasized my previous point: Every Mahāyāna tradition is faith based. One of the glaring shortcomings of Tibetan Buddhism is in taking a faith based, visionary tradition, and trying to interpret it literally. Of course, this began in India, with proofs of omniscience and so on. But that doesn't legitimize it. Here the Tibetans could learn a thing or two from the Chinese and Japanese masters.

Maybe there is also the unspoken expectation, too, that westerners are all wealthy, so they should pay more. In India even at government tourist sites you pay 100 rupees, the locals pay 5 rupees. The cost of tuition at the Rangjung Yeshe Institute is also much more than what locals pay, and as a foreigner you pay your tuition in US dollars, too.

Tell me if I'm wrong, but in TB in Asia, I think the cost of everything increases if you're a westerner? Perhaps speaking Tibetan puts you on the cost scale of a local because they don't need to use extra services to support you (like English speaking staff and so on).

No, since the ten stages are treated the same way. In Chinese Buddhism they are merely encased within an alternate scheme, but when I say first bhumi, I mean the first bodhisattva bhumi as described in the Dasabhumika sutra.
That's the point, it is not treated the same way. Here's Buswell's summary based on Tongxuan's work:
"The ten bhumis are the original foundation of all dharmas. Here the bodhisattva pervades all dharmas, all directions, and all positions simultaneously. Development before this stage involved some measure of effort and entailed as well the progressive development of meritorious practices. By the time the bodhisattva has reached the ten bhumis, however, he has nothing left to practice and nothing left to achieve. It is a kind of "firming-up" stage at which all the qualities and achievements attained throughout the previous levels are matured and allowed to infuse his entire being. He merges with all dharmas without, however, losing his own identity in the process. This is the stage of the unimpeded interpenetration of all phenomena- the highest expression of spiritual attainment in the Avatamsaka Sutra and, by implication, in all the Buddhist scriptures."

Malcolm wrote:
As I said, it is treated in the same way. When a bodhisattva realizes the first bhumi, there is no more emptiness to realize, all that is left to do is to complete the two accumulations, as I told you, the ten stages only map qualities, not realization.

This is why the āryan path has only three phases: the path of seeing, the path of cultivation and the path of no more training. The ten bodhisattva stages are included within both the path of seeing (first bhumi) and the path of cultivation (first bhumi to tenth bhumi). The path of no more training is Buddhahood.

"What then is the difference between a Buddha and first stage bodhisattva?"

It depends on how the first stage and how a buddha is interpreted. Here's one interpretation from Wonhyo's commentary to the Vajrasamadhi Sutra that is based on the Huayan view,

"the first bhûmi in fact encompasses all ten bhûmis, for in one moment one may suddenly access the ten types of dharmadhOEtus. The ten bhûmis are in fact the first bhûmi, for all [ten] may instantly be completely fulfilled at this initial gate [of the first bhûmi]. Owing to the fact that the ten bhûmis are in fact the first bhûmi, [the first bhûmi] is called the “one.” But because the first bhûmi is in factthe ten bhûmis, it is also “many.” Consequently, [the first bhûmi] is called the “one-and-many bhûmi.”"

Malcolm wrote:
This is just intellectual contrivance.




Astus said:
In a similar fashion it is discussed by those who few (Zongmi, Jinul) who attempted to connect Chan with the doctrinal teachings, mainly Huayan. So it is not much different from what you say, however, they called sudden enlightenment not the entry to the first bhumi but the entry to the level of faith which is the first of the 52 levels. That makes your interpretation of Chan's sudden enlightenment a lot more positive than theirs. On the other hand, their interpretation is a bit more complex, as it is briefly explained by Buswell in a footnote:

Malcolm wrote:
That makes the term 'sudden buddhahood" meaningless since it is far below the path of seeing, this so called "buddha" has not even recognized emptiness. No wonder people are confused.




Astus said:
So, even if it sounds lot of "sophistry" and "sleight of hand", Chan focuses on immediate experience of the ultimate

Malcolm wrote:
The first of the 52 bhumis is not anywhere near the path of seeing, so there is no immediate experience of the ultimate that can even be discussed.

Astus said:
and so there aren't many discussions on bodhisattva stages, because having "stages", "levels" and "grades" of enlightenment are all ideas of "how it could be", while directly attaining no-thought and maintaining it in all situations - that's why I protested against the distinction of equipoise and post-equipoise - is the essential teaching and realisation.

Thus the rhetoric says that one's enlightenment is that of Shakyamuni's but the experience is not quite there ranging as I mentioned from higher up the Path of Accumulation to the lower bhumis.

Regarding the dana-paramita (although the quoted MPPS section does not mentioned it) here is a little explanation from Dazhu Huihai:

Q: Where can one enter the doorway to this understanding?
A: Through the perfection of charity (dana-paramita).
Q: Buddha has said that the six paramitas are the action of the Bodhisattva path, so how can we enter the doorway to this understanding by practicing, as you have said, only the dana-paramita?
A: People who are confused or deluded do not understand that the other five paramitas all evolve from the dana-paramita. Therefore, in practicing the dana-paramita, one also fulfills the practice of the other five paramitas.
Q: For what reason is it called the dana-paramita?
A: "Dana" means the perfection of charity.
Q: What things can be given up in the name of charity?
A: Clinging to thoughts of duality can be given up.
Q: Just what does this mean?
A: It means to give up clinging, in the name of charity, to thoughts of good and evil, existence and non-existence, love and hate, emptiness and fullness, concentration and non-concentration, pure and impure, etc. In the name of charity, give up all of them. Then, and only then, can you attain the stage of the voidness of duality, while, at the same time, letting neither a thought about the voidness of opposites nor about charity arise. This is the genuine practice of the dana-paramita, which is also known as absolute detachment from all phenomena. This is only the voidness of all dharma-nature, which means that always and everywhere is just no-mind. If one can attain the stage of no-mind everywhere, no form will be perceived, because our self-nature is void, containing no form. This, then, is true Reality, which is also called the wonderful form or body of the Tathagata. The Diamond Sutra says: "Those who have abandoned all forms are called Buddhas."

Malcolm wrote:
It has already been pointed how the realization of emptiness of a first stage bodhisattva is identical in content to the realization of emptiness of a Buddha. But surely you admit that there is a difference between a first stage bodhisasattva and Buddha. If there is no difference in terms of the nature of reality, what then do you think the difference is?


Astus said:
The two accumulations of merit and wisdom are present in the mind. Emptiness is wisdom, function is compassion. Zen affirms that the trikaya is present in the nature of mind, so it is not that one has to develop wisdom for the dharmakaya and merit for rupakaya, but the buddha-mind is already perfect in all aspects. Still, that doesn't deny that there is also a gradual path of the bodhisattva, however, the gradual path doesn't deny the existence of a sudden path. Thrangu Rinpoche says that on the sutrayana it takes a long time to achieve buddhahood because they use analytical-conceptual meditation but Mahamudra uses an experiential method of directly looking at the nature of mind. A similar argument could be made in the case of Zen too.

Malcolm wrote:
Mahāmudra is part of secret mantra. Since the methods of mahāmudra do not exist in Zen, a similar argument cannot be made.


Astus said:
This might help better understanding, here is Zongmi's differentiation between the five dhyanas, that is, the levels of practice:
5. Direct (sudden) realization of the essential purity of ones own mind, originally without defilements, itself endowed with the influx-free (non-afflicted) gnosis - this mind is Buddha, ultimate with nothing else beyond - cultivating in this manner, is the Supreme Vehicle Dhyana. It is also known as the Pure Dhyana of the Tathagatas.

This is no different than the realization of a first stage bodhisattva. What then is the difference between a Buddha and first stage bodhisattva? You have still failed to answer this point.

I see. So the problem is the lack of the two accumulations. But even in the Prajnaparamita teachings we find that one paramita includes all the other paramitas.

In the Mahaprajnaparamitasastra (30.5.3; vol. 2, p. 859, tr. Lamotte-Migme) we find even the concept of abstaining for all kinds of practices, "Furthermore, the bodhisattva acquires the Prajñāpāramitā without practicing any dharma and without acquiring any dharma. Why? All practices (caryā) are erroneous and futile: from near or far, they present faults. In fact, bad dharmas (akuśaladharma) are faulty from close up; as for good dharmas, they are transformed and modified from far away; those who become attached to them will end up by experiencing pain and sorrow; thus they show defects from far off. [Good and bad practices] are like an appetizing food and a disgusting food both of which have been poisoned."

There is also the story of Prasannendriya and Agramati (MPPS, vol. 1, p. 323ff) where the first only taught insight into the true nature of reality without renouncing the world and the other all the many practices and ascetic methods. Prasannendriya became a buddha eventually and Agramati had to undergo lot of suffering later on.

Adding the buddha-mind teachings, the nature of mind has perfect function, the functioning of a buddha, and this is the display of all the qualities. What is there to accumulate for it?

Malcolm wrote:
Again, this is just philosophical slight of hand, using the teaching of the emptiness of phenomena (shown above) to try and demonstrate that conventional phenomena are not effective borders on nihilism.

Further, this supposes that practicing dana paramita and realizing dana paramita is sufficient for full buddhahood. It is not. It is sufficient for realizing the first bodhisattva bhumi, and that is all. As I mentioned above, the emptiness realized on the path of seeing and the emptiness that a Buddha realizes is the same emptiness. There is no difference at all in the realization of emptiness of a first stage bodhisattva and a Buddha. But there is a difference in affliction and omniscience.

You might try and will it away with philosophical sophistries, but this is not the intention of Mahāyāna.

Do you deny the possibility that authentic Buddhism is not bound by geographical location?

Vajrayana claims buddhahood within one lifetime, so it is not exactly true that all agreed on the time it has to take to achieve it.

No, you are missing the point -- Vajrayānists in India accepted the lenghty time period for achieveing buddhahood based on the accumulating the two collections.

Please precise with your terms -- does sudden enlightenment mean sudden buddhahood, or sudden awakening on one of the bhumis?

The doctrine here under question is the idea promulgated by some Chan masters that Buddhahood does not require the two collections. This is unprecedented in Indian Buddhism, including Vajrayāna (as well as Dzogchen).


Astus said:

It is clear that certain Chan ideas about "Buddhahood" have no precedent in the Buddhism promulgated in India, including the Buddhism of Vajrayāna.


Astus said:
Just as in India so it was in China that there were different traditions and interpretations of the Buddhadharma. Sudden enlightenment might be inconceivable for the Theravada and early Mahayana followers, but not so for the Vajrayana.

Malcolm wrote:
There is no such thing as a "sudden enlightenment" in Vajrayāna which is free from the two collections. The rapid awakening in Vajrayāna is predicated on gathering the two accumulations extremely rapidly -- not, as in some Chan formulations, dismissing their importance all together.


Astus said:
Vajrayana developed in India and Chan developed in China. Neither of them are something you could find in such mainstream schools as the Sarvastivadins or the Dharmaguptakas.

Malcolm wrote:
What Vajrayāna shares with Sarvastivadins or the Dharmaguptakas is that by normal means, buddhahood requires a minimum of three asaṃkhyakalpas to acheive. In order to bypass that requirement, Vajrayāna proposes the adoption of a specfic methodology by which these two collections may be gathered in a single lifetimes, and progress through the paths and stages, including all the visionary indicators of such progress that may be measured through yoga specific indications in the experience of the meditator on both a mental and physical level.

Chan masters that promulgate the extreme notions of sudden buddhahood, by contrast, hinge their argumemts solely on the notion that paths, practice, merit, virtue, are part of relative truth and therefore are a waste of time even to consider as having anything to do with attaining buddhahood -- that in fact, buddhahood is not attainable by any relative means whatsoever. The consequence of course is that these extreme speculations of the part of certain Chan masters render their version of buddhahood unrecognizable as buddhahood. We can call it Buddhism since they insist they are Buddhist, but it resembles nothing at all like mainstream Buddhism.

Astus said:
But then it comes down to the spatial distance between India and China. Do you find that an important point? In my view, the source of Dharma is the Buddha and not a place, nationality, ethnicity, political system or climate.

Malcolm wrote:
What I find important is that there is a serious discontinuity between the idea of buddhahood promulgated by certain extreme Chan masters and the rest of the Buddhist world.

You seem to think the argument hinges on sudden verses slow. It does not. It hinges on whether buddhahood is accomplished by virtue of the two things all Mahāyāna sutras say it is accomplished by i.e. the practice of the perfections and the two accumulations. Vajrayāna differs solely from common Mahāyāna of India, in this respect, by virtue of the suggestion that there are means by which one can reduce the amount of time it takes to generate the complete two collections from the daunting three incalculable eons to one, seven or sixteen lifetimes.

These Chan speculations you have introduced, on the other hand, hinge on philosophical sleights of hand that I have already pointed out. My point is that these philosphical speculations have no precedent in Indian Buddhism.

Whether one accepts them or not is entirely a matter of personal choice. I don't accept them, since I think they represent a deviation from Indian Buddhism -- I do not believe that there was any person who became a Buddha without gathering the two accumulations in their entirety.

In the end it is not a question of valid or invalid, it is a question of definitions. For me, a Buddhahood divorced from the two accumulations is impossible.

Here we have the same argument of the qualities being present in the basis.

Malcolm wrote:
No, we just have the usual philosophical sleight of hand I mentioned above.

The point that I am really trying to make is that Indian Mahāyānists took their own tradition seriously. For example, Nāgārjuna in the Ratnavali lists in some detail how much merit is required for each of the major and minor marks, when encouraging the king to cultivate merit.

And three uncalculable eons is not even really a Mahāyāna number. It is a number which comes from the earliest ideas about the length of time it took the bodhisattva to acheive buddhahood.

So on the one hand, we have the Indian tradition (Mahāyāna, Vajrayāna and the śrāvaka traditions) insisting that in order to become a buddha one must practice the paramitas for an insanely long period of time. And on the other hand we have a tradition a tradition in China which asserts all this is so much unnecessary proliferation.

Saying that "qualities are present in the basis" is a meaningless statement. Butter is present in milk, but it does not come out all by itself, oil is present in sesame seeds but it does not extract itself. And which qualities exactly?

Of coure what we are dealing with here is a specfies of tathāgatagarbha thinking, but even hear, I don't think that the type of instant buddhahood you see some Chan masters proclaiming can be justified on the basis of any Indian sutras, tathāgatgarbha or otherwise.

Of course, this is the realm of religion, so no one can prove anything since it all boils down to belief.

Malcolm wrote:
But we do count Indian Mahāyāna, since Vajrayāna is an extension of Indian Mahāyāna.

BTW, no one said it was impossible to become a buddha in this life. The notion is "is buddhahood in a single lifetime" a possibility? In India Mahāyāna, the answere is no-- Indian Mahayāna of whatever stripe requires three incalculable eons at minimumfor full awakening. In Vajrayāna, the answer is yes, since through special methods it is made possible.

It seems to me that rather than providing methods, certain Chan masters who try to prove full enlightment in the span of a single lifetime, engage in a philosphical feints to support their conception, in general resorting to arguments by means of ultimate truth to try and prove their point, basically arguing the doctrine of paths and stages is an unnecessary conceptual limitation. However, when challenged, I don't see a coherent defense being mounted, which has lead me to believe that much like pure land buddhism, Chan is in fact a faith oriented school.

My question about why they didn't just translate it as "wisdom" was meant as a kind of frustrated rhetorical question, actually. They are writing for an English audience, so it would make a lot more sense to avoid a literal translation for one that makes more sense to the audience. Nobody but a scholar would understand that "ordinary mind" is a yogi's term for "wisdom." It's funny, too, because in the Translator's Introduction, he makes the point to say he has used translated ye shes as wisdom and goes on to explain how that translation is not entirely accurate and why, but he makes no mention of "ordinary mind" whatsoever.

Well, the reason why they continue to translate it literally is that there is an important explanation connected with tha mal gyi shes pa.

Therefore, to connect Chan to Indian Mahayana one has to go back in time a bit, to around the 4th century when things started to take shape. That means that the primary treatises of Chinese Buddhism are not those that are used in Tibet to understand Mahayana.

Well, this is definitely not so. Sutra studies in Tibetan Buddhism is based primarily, though not exclusively on treatise authored between the 2-6th century.

WHat is more accurate to say is that China, being an outpost of Buddhism, was in many respects out of the main stream of the development of Mahāyāna theory in India. What is also true, is that Chinese Buddhists tended to ignore Indian sastra literature, and prefer their own interpretations of Buddhist sutras to those of Indian masters. For example, Huayen masters really looked down on Asanga.

I, personally, am tired of all the precedents.  I want to continue the relationships that I have, cultivate them through my thirst for Buddhism, cultivate myself, and see where I get.

Having a teacher helps, but in the end one must integrate these things into your own practice.

Rather then looking for a "beginners" Buddhism (since there really isn't such a thing), look for Dharma teachings that speak to you, and work for you in a practical manner. Take what you can absorb and leave the rest.

In the end, great compassion is the essence of Dharma. Great compassion comes from compassion. Cultivate that, and that is sufficient.

Malcolm wrote:
The Dharma, as I understand, begins with understanding our real state and acknowledging it, and not having fantasies about samsara or ourselves. Dharma is not an all or nothing venture. It is progressive, and one only has to practice as much if it as one understands.

For example, you are not ready to drink the Buddhist koolaid and buy rebirth, karma, and so on hook line and sinker -- you may not even really beleive in awakening. But what you can believe is your own experience, and the painfulness of desire, hatred and ignorance, as well as the joyfulness that connection with other sentient beings can bring.

The Buddha's own advice for people who were not able to adopt his perspectives about rebirth and karma automatically is that they focus their attention on cultivating loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and ultimately, equanimity.

Once, in response to a statement by Shariputra that friendship was half of the life of a Dharma practitioner, Buddha replied that was incorrect, friendship was the whole of the life of a Dharma practitioner. Thus, cultivating loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity are Dharma practice and relationships forged on these bases are deeply fulfilling and satisfying. Not only that, any relationship, positive or negative, one presently is in can be immensely transformed by these four cultivations. Positive relationships are enhanced and deepened, negative relationships will weaken their grasp and one will come to a place of evenness regarding other people's suffering afflictive behavior, an eveness suffused with genuine care for others along with a sharp recognition of one's own limitations around helping others. Equanimity is not indifference, it is recognizing what one is and is not able to accomplish.

In other words, we don't have to a) fix the world b) be emotional unavailable c) persist in unhealthy relationships -- instead we can slowly work at opening our hearts with love and compassion and work with where we are at the present moment without having to condition it with unattainable idealism.

Learning calm-abiding or shamatha meditation is very helpful, since this trains us in mental stability. Shamatha creates a container where we are able to see how the mind thrashes, bolts, revolts, jumps around and so on. It gives us a pillar through which to measure the rest of our experience. We do not have to begin with hour long sessions, we can sit for 5 minutes. Then 10. Then 15, and so on. Following the breath is an ideal practice for beginners as well.

Anyway, the main point is that Buddhist practice is not about waking up to some abstract "enlightenment". It is about knowing one's own state, right here and right now and working with that, along with various means to do so.

In short, understanding our present condition is Dharma practice, and it is the only Dharma practice we have.

No, if this were so then Buddhas would be afflictively attached to sentient beings, and they are not. The afflicitively-attached person owns their afflictions. There is no principle of samsaric co-dependence between Buddhas and sentient beings, which is what you are describing.

BTW, there is no such a thing as "trying" to be non-afflictively attached. One is either afflicted, not afflicted, or possess patience regarding the arising of one's own afflictions. If one possesses affliction, it is better to recognize that fact and not pretend one is above affliction.

Afflictions (desire, anger and ignorance) generally only function freely when one is not in possession of recognition of the operation of mental factors driven by affliction and b) when one's mind lacks stability. When one attains patience towards one's the arising of one's afflictions, they arise but lack force that propells one to act upon them.

In terms of parenting or caring for others, when one is purely under the infleunce of affliction, to some extent that care is blind and filled with self-interest. When one's afflicted relationship is characterized with patience, one is better able to make universal choices affecting all involved without falling under the fog of blind selfish interest. When one is free from affliction, one's caring for others comes from a place of pure altruism and equanimity.

Pretending that one is free of affliction is bullshit. That is not how afflictive attachment works. A realized bodhisattva possesses non-afflictive attachment towards all sentient beings. A non-realized bodhisattva possesses bias and attachment. If one is not realized, it is better to just recognize one's own state and work with it.

I.e. if you are attached to your kids, don't pretend not to be, don't pretend you are free from suffering around it, and work with it. Bodhisattvas can work with attachment and desire -- the one thing they cannot work with is anger and hatred. From a Mahāyāna perspective therefore, attachment is workable and it is fine. If you combine your afflicted relationships with altruistic motivation, you can even bring them onto the path, and make them part of your path.

Malcolm wrote:
If we, who are not realized, have no way to infer what is correct and incorrect regarding Buddhist doctrine, than we are really screwed, aren't we?

Citations are not sufficient, of course, one must also use reasoning, and a whole host of other things.

There is no need to use citations in this respect, it is obvious to anyone who really thinks about it --1) realizing emptiness is not equivalent with becoming a Samyak Sambuddha, 2) realizing emptiness, period, is the emptiness realized by a Buddha.

The ancient Chan masters are making the argument than the realization of emptiness is sufficient and there is not much reason to place a lot of emphasis on the path of cultivation (bhumis 1-10). Once in possession of the Gnosis of the path, that is the main point, and that is Buddhahood.

There is a similar sentiment in Kagyu Mahāmudra -- which is why there are so many different presentations of the way four yogas (split into twelve) are mapped to the paths and stages. But in reality, the Mahāyāna paths and stages are irrelvent in Mahamudra, just as they are in Dzogchen. It is not the case however that there is no gradual progression in both mahamudra and dzogchen. The progression is not with respect to the ultimate, but rather, with respect to the person.

Now then, the question inevitably arises "Is it possible for someone to fully awaken suddenly?" The answer to this question from a Mahamudra, Dzogchen and Chan POV is yes (and from a Vajrayāna POV, one's yogic progress through the stages can be accomplished in a matter of days, theoretically (for example, Saraha was someone who acheived full buddhahood suddenly; Virupa acheived the sixth bhumi in six days)). The caveat to this is that it is so rare as to be merely an academic distinction. In other words, sudden awakeners are possible, but rarer than visible stars at noon.

The inexpressible realization of emptiness is the same in every respect from the moment of the path of seeing until full buddhahood. We can talk about afflcitive obscurations and knowledge obscurations and so on, but the real difference between buddhas and bodhisattvas on the stages is whether there is a difference in equipoise and post-equipoise. Buddhas are never not in a state of equipoise. Thus the notion of the two obscurations apply only in post-equipoise, not while in eqiupoise on the ultimate. However, this crucial difference is responsible also for the difference in qualities of a buddha and for example, a tenth stager.

Thus, it is important to distinguish rhetoric from reality so that people do not waste their time on fantasies. And it is indeed a fantasy for 99.999 percent of people that they will be able to suddenly awaken into full Buddhahood.

One needs to make a distinction between afflictive attachment and non-afflictive attachment. Non-afflictive attachment comes from a place of concern and caring, valuing others more than oneself. Afflictive attachment is all about "I, me and mine".

From a Mahāyāna perspective, non-afflictive attachment is perfectly appropriate, indeed necessary. Afflictive attachment is just another cause of suffering.

Awakening in Chan means realising the nature of mind, i.e. the buddha-mind. Since the buddha-mind is perfect in qualities and omniscience, how could that awakening be limited? It is free from the emotional (klesa) and conceptual (jneya) obscurations, how could it be bound by anything at all? Teachers of Chan were well aware of the gradual stages and aeons of bodhisattva practice when they talked about buddhahood and claimed that Chan is a sudden path. Those who viewed it in a different way did say so.

Malcolm wrote:
The difference lies in equipoise and post-equipoise.

Frankly, it is obvious that realizing the nature of the mind does not make one a buddha. That is why I stated that "buddhahood" in Chan is a euphemism for awakening, but it does not mean that one who has awakened is a Samyaksambuddha, though I imagine there are some deluded Chan practitioners even today who think it is so.

As for the difference between the entry to the bodhisattva stages and full buddhahood, in Chan it is clarified with the distinction of gradual and sudden paths. Gradual means the bodhisattva stages, sudden means immediate buddhahood. Of course, not everyone among the Chan teachers agreed with this view.

Huseng said:
The primary precepts in the Brahma Net Sutra are called prātimokṣa.

In any case this is all legal terminology and intellectual wrangling. Regardless of how others saw them, many bodhisattva renunciates of the past were, at least within their own culture, qualified to receive offerings, wear the religious attire appropriate for a monk and were considered by their peers and society to be monks. This obviously is not applicable to the wider global Buddhist world where the ancient Indian legal terminology was and still is in effect.

Malcolm wrote:
In general, we can say that there is a Bodhisattva "prātimokṣa", but it depends on śrāvaka pratimokṣa. There is a sutra in that Ratnakuta (Chang, Treasury of Mahāyāna Sūtras pg. 262) that discusses and contrasts the prātimokṣa of a bodhisattva with that of a śrāvaka, but there is no suggestion in this text that bodhisattvas enjoy a seperate ordination from śrāvakas -- it merely distinguishes the parameters of conduct for bodhisattvas and non-bodhisattvas.

There really is no way to get around this. There is a separate ordination for bodhisattvas distinct from that of what we generally call "buddhist monks".

You are the one who is intellectually wrangling with this.

For me, it is very simple. If you have received an ordination based on one of the eighteen schools Vinaya, you are a monk or a nun. If not, then you are lay person. Added to this are bodhisattva vows, etc.

Huseng said:
The vinayas of India are all different, hence reflecting different aspirations and intentions at work in their formulation.

Malcolm wrote:
They reflect regional seperation, but not separation of difference in aspiration and intention. The vinayas of India are more similar than they are different from one another. The primary differences between them are in the number of minor rules, the cut and color of the robes, and the regional language of the school.

Bodhisattva vow systems on the other hand are quite different in terms of aspiration and intention. The Brahmajala system in China is clearly in keeping with the Yogachara model, rather than the Madhyamaka model (which is based on the Akashagarbha Sutra).

Your use of the term śramaṇa is not universal. The term śramaṇa was used to refer to renunciates in general in several Āgama sūtras in classical Chinese translation I've read.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, that is true, śramaṇa was a term applied to both Buddhist and non-Buddhsit mendicants. However, in the context of what constitutes a śramaṇa with the Buddhist order, it is a novice.

Basically in Saichō's time in China the legal terminology determining what constituted a "monk" or seng 僧 was not based on Sanskrit definitions provided in the vinaya. I understand from an Indian or Tibetan perspective this appears odd, but that's just how it developed.

They had monastic rules, and I imagine the monks from Central Asia and those few from India orally taught the vinaya and perhaps transmitted it to some, but there was no Chinese translation of even one vinaya system until the 5th century.

If those bodhisattva precepts are actually followed in their entirety one would be living a lifestyle in line with the vinaya. The problem is that in Japan some centuries later they decided it was optional to follow any of the prescriptions contained in any text. Even if they still transmitted the vinaya they would have had the same ideas about it, too. Everything became optional. The prescriptions in the Brahma Net Sūtra were no less sacred then those in the vinaya.

For example, the Chinese obsession with elaborating individual sutra systems and so on. As you know, Indians, in the end, relied more on sastras than the raw material of sutras.

The convenience stores in Shanghai are more or less identical to what you find in Japan (Japan is mostly western). Massive amounts of plastic wrapped in plastic. More and more people want their own private cars, too, even if it is really unnecessary.

Alternately, Saicho may have been reacting against the newly imported Indian Mantrayāna sense of listing teachings in terms of their hierarchy (just as Chan reacted to Mantrayāna by inventing a lineage of patriarchs going back to the Buddha). While Kukai did not resort to the Nine Yanas scheme (yet to be elaborated by the Nyingmapas) both masters (Saicho and Kukai) were clearly aware of the four tenet system in India and the subsequent need to classify Chinese innovations in a progressive scheme, albeit differently and for different reasons. And naturally Kukai selected a nice round number for his progressive ladder of Buddhist and non-Buddhist teachings in China and Japan, with Confucism and Taoism at the bottomg of the rungs.

Kukai's "mantrayāna as the conclusion of all dharma teachings" is one alternative; Saicho's attempting to contextualize all teachings in light of Tien Tai Lotus hermeneutics is another. Of these two, Kukai's approach is ultimately the more Indian Buddhist, and Saicho's more reflective of indegenous developments in Chinese Buddhism.

I was told that Tibetan "monks" are not necessarily all bhikṣus, and that, at least around Kathmandu, most of them are not fully ordained bhikṣus with the 250 vows.


Malcolm wrote:
These are dge tshuls, śramaṇeras. They are rab byungs i.e. pravrajitas, ordained persons. They are therefore part of the ordained Sangha and can participate in posadha. Pravrajitas consist of all śramaṇeras and śramaṇerikas, bhikṣus and bhikṣunis.

Thus the term "rab byung" refers to all ordained persons. The colloquial term is "Trapa" i.e. shaveling.

A pravrajita is someone who has undertaken formal ordination beyond lay pratimoksha. But there is no such a thing as a Mahāyāna pravrajita at least not in any Indian Buddhist tradition with which I am familiar. The reason is that Indian Buddhists held that Mahāyāna vows were held to supplement or transform one's pratimoksha vows, but not that they substituted for them, as it seems some Chinese Buddhists and later Saicho held.

The literature of vows became very important in India after the 8th century because with the proliferation of systems of ethics between various of the shravaka schools, then in the two strands of Mahāyāna vows and finally within the successive layers of tantra series, it all started to become contentious and confusing. Nevertheless, Mahāyāna and later Vajrayāna vows were considered to float on the platform of Hinayāna vows which were considered indispensible.

Well, no. I think that he did not understand the importance of pratimoksha and did not understand that the consequences of his understanding was to relegate so called monastics to the level of lay people inadvertantly. Because of Saicho, we now have Japanese priests claiming equal status with bhikṣus in Buddhist assemblies just because they shave their heads and wear religious  costumes.

Huseng said:
At least in his time anyway he insisted on celibacy and abstaining from alcohol. The Brahm Net Sutra's precepts prescribe monastic regulations not so different from what a bhiksu would be expected to uphold. That was the case at least when he was alive.

Personally I think even if Japan still had the vinaya it would have went down the route it did. Up until the 19th century most priests were in practice monks, even by law, and it was influence from protestant Christianity that had them drop the whole celibacy thing in favour of hereditary priesthoods. For most Japanese Buddhists precepts are just suggestions, and unless you do something illegal there really are no consequences for deviating from monastic precepts (at least when outside a seminary). I mean technically if you get the Brahma Net Sutra precepts you're swearing yourself to celibacy, though they read it as "no sexual misconduct" which can mean anything really.

I guess it doesn't help that everyone is aware the said sutra was probably penned in China, meaning there is less perceived need to follow any of what it says, even if your whole tradition is founded on it.

Malcolm wrote:
The Brahmajala sutra is clearly based on the Yogacara bodhisattva vow tradition which is more formal and more heavily predicated on pratimoksha than the Madhyamaka bodhisattva vow tradition. According to Bhikshu Dharmamitra, in Chinese Buddhism one was not really permitted to take the bodhisattva ordination without being grounded in pratimoksha vows first, which is how the Yogacahara system works. The Madhyamaka system does not require a preliminary ordination. Lay pratimoksha vows are taken along with bodhisattva vows.

However, not drinking and remaining celibate does not make a one monk, nor does a shaved head. The only thing that makes a bhikṣu is receiving bhikṣu vows in a qualified way, as I am sure you agree.

Since there are no Mahāyāna bhikṣu vows, receiving a Mahāyāna ordination cannot make one a monk, in my opinion. Of course, this is a thoroughly Indo-Tibetan attitude.

I'm trying to learn more about the Sakya tradition as I just found that there's a center near me run by Lama Pema Wangdak, who I might be interested in meeting.

I've been studying Vajrayana for several years and took refuge 2 years ago. Since then I've tried practicing Dzogchen through Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, but I feel I really want a live connection with a teacher, so I am investing the centers around me. So far, I really like Mahamudra because it seems very similar to the view of Dzogchen but a more gradual approach, which makes me interested in Kagyu. I can't find much info about Sakya or Lamdre and its similarities/differences with Mahamudra/Dzogchen. Could someone familiar with both Mahamudra and the Sakya tradition share with me the differences? is Sakya a strictly tantric lineage with no 'direct' or 'essence' teachings?

"efficient and sustainable energy source" in my understanding - and I can be wrong of course - is the same as an infinite source of energy. Not realistic. But my knowledge is very limited here.

You may call it giving, compassion, enlightenment, etc. - these are ideas. You can't make people give - unless you start a so called "proletariat dictatorship". Since you can't make them give, can't convert them to new views either, the plan fails. That's what I was saying with the failure of religions and ideologies. Therefore, either we go medieval or new technologies. Both are mostly external (i.e. easier to recognise and accept by the majority) forces that make people follow new rules.

"Infinite source of energy" does not exist, especially not on Earth. Keeping population low (it's already too high) and living in a rural environment would mean a sustainable livelihood where small communities can live on locally produced food and move regularly to arable land until the used land regenerates. That's quite medieval and would require a global catastrophe to reduce humanity into such a culture.

Malcolm wrote:
I don't think so -- environmental systems and human cultures respond to inputs of energy in the same way. Slowely remove the inputs and the community falters and gradually dies back. Unless we find oil in Greenland and in the Artic poles that is easy to recover as it was in Texas in 1880, we have reached the limit of easily extractable oil. Since that is the case, we will see a gradual decline in human population because well, there won't be enough food to feed everyone. The oceans are becoming increasingly acidic due to higher amounts of CO2 in the atmosphere  and so on. We will see industrial civilization come to a shuddering halt over the next three hundred years. We lived through the high point of industrial civilization, and it is all downhill from here, unless you follow Ray Kurzweil's theories.

This is a common misconception, because as far as I know that letter was written long before Shenpen Dawa Rinpoche was grown so yes, Chatral Rinpoche was declared his regent at a certain point, and would have been had HH passed away earlier in life. ( HH planned to pass on earlier but was kept around by the many methods of his Sangyum...)
However an old letter does not change that HH later declared S.D. Rinpoche his regent, as his health deteriorated towards the end. In fact, S.D. Rinpoche very humbly always remained by his fathers side, serving him and sometimes translating for him until the very end. He never publicly taught due to prophecies until he passed a certain age. Then, at one point HH was scheduled to give a wang and to everyone's surprise including S.D.Rinpoche he simply handed the implements to his son and told him to give the wang. This was a direct way of showing that there was no difference. This all happened in Europe, so I am sure there is doubt among elder Tibetans living in Asia who became accustomed to receiving wangs and teachings from T.N.Rinpoche years before according to HH's advice. And TNR already had quite a following and had established his own centers by the time HH passed on so perhaps he saw as Dudjom Lingpa foresaw with the Dudjom tersar in relation to the Rinchen Terdzod that there was no need to include it-- likewise no need to announce Thinley Norbu in any way as he already had his own recognition and following that had it's own vast momentum. This is my own understanding which may be at fault but I have learned details slowly over many years which are often glossed over for various reasons.

In the hua tou method one is given a meditation topic/question. For example, "Who is dragging this corpse around?" or "Who is chanting Buddhas name?" You are instructed to continually ask this question until one pointedness is achieved. Great doubt is developed from asking a question that does not have an answer that the logical/rational/thinking mind can answer. One keeps pushing and pushing to come up with an answer nonetheless. Eventually one breaks through and the separateness of mind, body and world drops away leaving one with a deep understanding of shunyata.

It has nothing to with the superiority or inferiority of humans in terms of some hierarchy of sentient beings based on intelligence or development. Please note that causing a schism in the Sangha is one of those five sins.

I will have to disagree. I would say a cow is more developed than an insect. Something like killing an Arhat is different from killing a human being.

Malcolm wrote:
The only difference between a fly, a cow and a human being is that a human being can attain buddhahood. Therefore, killing a human being is considered a parakija, an offense punishable by losing one's monastic vows.

The difference between an arya and a human beings is that an arya can help other human beings awaken. Thus, harming a buddha or killing an Arhat is one of the five deeds that results in immediate rebirth in lower realms.

A cow and a fly are both the same in that neither can attain buddhahood in that body, both have minds. There is no qualitative difference between a vow and a fly, only a quantitative difference in terms of sense organ development. From an ethical point of view, this means that the life of a fly and the life of a cow are equal. Moreover, there is no difference in self-awareness. Cows and flies exhibit the same degree of self-awareness i.e. when you try to harm either, they react by protecting themselves.

There is no Buddhist teaching of which I am aware that states that preserving the life of mammals is more important than perserving the life of small creatures like flies and worms because mammals are "more developed".

Malcolm wrote:
Not large scale organic farming. The primary difference is the type of pesticides:

ORGANIC PESTICIDES VERSUS SYNTHETIC PESTICIDES

Clearly, the less we impact our environment, the better off we all are. Organic farming practices have greatly advanced the use of non-chemical means to control pests, as mentioned earlier.
Unfortunately, these non-chemical methods do not always provide enough protection, and it's necessary to use chemical pesticides. How do organic pesticides compare with conventional pesticides?

A recent study compared the effectiveness of a rotenone-pyrethrin mixture versus a synthetic pesticide, imidan. Rotenone and pyrethrin are two common organic pesticides; imidan is considered a "soft" synthetic pesticide (i.e., designed to have a brief lifetime after application, and other traits that minimize unwanted effects). It was found that up to 7 applications of the rotenone- pyrethrin mixture were required to obtain the level of protection provided by 2 applications of imidan.

It seems unlikely that 7 applications of rotenone and pyrethrin are really better for the environment than 2 applications of imidan, especially when rotenone is extremely toxic to fish and other aquatic life.

It should be noted, however, that we don't know for certain which system is more harmful. This is because we do not look at organic pesticides the same way that we look at conventional pesticides. We don't know how long these organic pesticides persist in the environment, or the full extent of their effects.

When you look at lists of pesticides allowed in organic agriculture, you find warnings such as, "Use with caution. The toxicological effects of [organic pesticide X] are largely unknown," or "Its persistence in the soil is unknown." Again, researchers haven't bothered to study the effects of organic pesticides because it is assumed that "natural" chemicals are automatically safe.

"In the same way, when we pay attention to our breath, body sensations, and to the awareness that arises, then all the illusions, suffering, confusion, sorrow, and personal issues, all of this begins to dissipate. We see that all of these experiences are born of delusion. This is the sense of “I.” “I am real. I am truly existent.” Everything is gone except this “I,” this sense of self. Then, when we continue meditating, the sense of self also goes away. When we just keep meditating, when we just remain in that present awareness and observe, then the self dissolves too. When the self dissolves there is just pure awareness. When the self completely collapses, there is this inexpressible, simple yet profound and ecstatic, compassionate awareness. Nobody is there. “I” is completely nonexistent in that place. There is no separation between samsara, bad circumstances, and nirvana, good circumstances, and there is nobody pursuing the path or chasing after enlightenment. In that moment we realize the essence of the Buddha’s teaching."

"Suddenly, when we stop producing concepts and ideas, when we stop feeding that illusory reality, when we stop associating with ego, it is very simple. It is simple to stop associating with ego. However there are no twelve step programs in transcendent wisdom. There is only the one-step program and that is to not associate with the ego. The moment we stop associating with ego it just immediately ceases right there."

Malcolm wrote:
Of course, since it refers to meat that is cornfed in feed lots.

So called grass-fed meat does not require these numbers. For example, there is a local beef farm near to me. They graze all of their cattle. They do not use corn. Since their cattle is all 100 percent grass fed, antibiotic and hormone free, numbers like the ones above do not apply. But these kinds of farms are

The water of use of cattle depends on the region and intensity of the production of meat. In dry regions, like the American West, what range land there is is so over grazed that the cattle need to be fattened for market. Large-scale cattle ranching is not only environmentally damaging in terms of grain inputs required to fatten cattle, in dry ranges it is very damaging to the environment such as soil, water, and so on in terms of erosion, etc., from cattle grazing.

Moreover as we know, cattle did not evolove to eat corn. It is bad for them.

And let's not even get started with hog farming -- that is an environmental nightmare, like chicken farming and so on.

Look, no one is arguing that there are no deep ethical and environmental issues with the production of meat. Of course there are. In an ideal world, no one would eat meat. But in an ideal world, no would suffer, experiencing birth, illness, aging and death either.

What is at issue is the assertion that just because one eats meat one necessarily has less compassion, one is taking on the karma of harming sentient beings, and so on. That assertion does not stand up to reasoning. The primary argument is that because someone purchases meat to eat that they are culpable in harming animals in the same manner as a butcher through economic participation on the meat industry. Well, from the viewpoint of how things are interconnected, since the meat industry is only possible because of oil and trucking and large supermarkets, if someone buys vegetables from a supermarket that sells meat, they are just as culpable as someone who buys meat. Why? Because there is no time that non-Buddhist people will voluntarily cease buying meat that is supplied to them. if someone participates in the economy of food production they are necessarily participating in the economy of meat production unless they have the option to eschew all contact with large supermarket chains for all their fruit and vegetable needs. The vast majority of people don't. People may even try to insulate themselves with a chain of vegan markets for example, but those markets will have to buy their food from suppliers, etc. So my point is that the economics of food production make it really impossible to say "This dollar that I am spending will not support animal husbandry in any way, shape or form".

Also, there is a lack of equanimity concerning suffering in the shrill arguments of radical vegan crew, frequent excuses about why it is permissible for pesticides to be used while slaughter is not permissable, and so on. Suffering is suffering, all of samsara is suffering down to the smallest atom.

The issue of meat-eating is at best a distraction from what is really important i.e. practice. Not eating meat does not make someone a better pracitioner, eating meat does not make one a worse practitioner. Not eating meat does not necessarily make someone more compassionate, eating meat does not necessarily make someone less compassionate.

I would add some more thoughts to the discussion of this topic.

In US, animals are institutionally raised in cages since they are young. Basically they stay in prison for the rest of their lives until the day they are killed. The 3 poisons on their minds also create poisons in their bodies. For larger animals such as cows and pigs, there are special ways to kill to get most if not all the blood out of their tissues so that we can have fresh meats. So I will not go into details of how they are killed. But you can do some research for yourself.

A Chinese Buddhist issue, apparently with no relevance to more universal sphere of Mahāyāna which existed in Central Asia, Tibet, India, Cambodia,Thailand, and so on. This effectively limits its relevance to Chinese and Japanese Buddhists. But in Japan, everyone now eats meat, more or less.

Don't get me wrong -- I am not against vegetrianism -- though as a doctor of Tibetan Medicine I have met lot of vegan people whose ailments were quickly eliminated  by a small amount of meat (incidentally, such a phenomena is regularly reported in Yoga magazines as well). Plus, there is the factor of milk intolerance. Then there is Chinese bias against Tibetans and other dairy-consuming people on the Western frontier of China, and so on. In the end the Chinese Buddhist prohibition against dairy and cheese is more likely to be a result of cultural bias than real concern for animals since they still used animal labor for agricultural production.

What you did not prove is that Veganism was grounded in Indian Mahāyāna (whose sutras you originally cited).

And further, in terms of Indian Buddhism, all we learned is that there is no consensus about what the Mahāyāna prohibitions against meat eating meant amongst Mahāyāna authors. So in the end you have failed to prove anything. And this is a good thing, since there is no liberation through dietary choices.

But if you harm something directly, with intention to harm, then this might interfere with your liberation, and that we have no need to establish, because it is well known.

On the contrary, what I have proven is that your thesis "All consumers or users of meat or any other animal product are by definition harmers of sentient beings" is outright false, when considered from a Buddhist perspective.

Huseng said:

Is a Chinese "apocryphal" text of less value than an Indian "apocryphal" text? From an academic point of view any Mahāyāna text no matter where it was penned is apocryphal.

Malcolm wrote:
Chinese sutras reflected the concerns of Chinese authors. If you go down this route, all you will wind up with is the conclusion that different communities of monks in different places wrote different texts reflecting different concerns. You then are left with the conclusion that one can only rely on one's own reasoning to decide what is correct and not correct and that there is no solid basis in citing sutras since the authority of sutra is undermined. This is actually my point, if you want to be a Vegan, go ahead. But there is no Buddhist justification for this.


Huseng said:
If you drive a car you are supporting the economy of meat production which depends upon oil from top to bottom. No oil, no huge meat industry. And that is just a fact. In fact if you shop at any market, you are supporting the meat industry, if you buy grain, you are supporting producers of grain which is fed to animals in feedlots. It is impossible to truly tease the economy of food production apart and say "If I buy this, I am not supporting that". Even if you buy organic cotton, pesticides are used in the production of that cotton, pesticides which are less toxic to humans, but no less toxic to bugs. If you decide to buy only clothes made of artificial fibers, you are supporting the oil industry which is supporting the this industry and that industry.
Those are all secondary to the actual production of a meat. If a city was to reduce meat consumption, the shops within it would order less meat from producers who in turn would slaughter less animals because there would be less demand for their product.

Malcolm wrote:
No, it is primary. Where this exist, that exists, where this does not exist, that does not exist -- basic dependent origination. Anyway, you are dreaming -- we live in a supply side economy, not a demand economy. There is demand precisely because there is supply.


Huseng said:
If you want to be a Vegan, fine, no problem -- but there is little or no justification for it from a Buddhist point of view.
From your Buddhist point of view. Things are different in the East Asian realm of Buddhism. We have texts and traditions which clearly encourage practitioners to avoid meat, and beyond that eggs and dairy as well.

Malcolm wrote:
And Chinese people do not have a deeply ingrained culture of eating everything that moves? Japanese people have not lived off of fish and other seafood for millenia? Etc.




Huseng said:
In fact all the Indian sutras encourage use of dairy, the very same ones that reject the consumption of meat.
Personally I'm not staunchly against dairy provided it is taken from a well treated animal. However, given that in the modern day so much of our dairy is produced under horrific conditions I have all the reason to boycott such products. I avoid dairy because I don't care to directly support such industries. Japan does not have a good record when it comes to animal welfare. The farmer in rural Bihar on the other hand with his herd of cattle grazing in lush green fields is not a big deal, but industrial milk production is.

Malcolm wrote:
I don't consume industrial dairy, actually.


Huseng said:
So therefore, the Vegan diet, even by strict vegetarian standards, is not supported in Buddhist sutras of Indian provenance.
Like I said in East Asia it is different. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas were and do work in a different cultural environment. If the result has been less animals suffering, then such teachings encouraging what we would call veganism in English, then all the better. That is Saddharma.


Malcolm wrote:
The idea that East Asia was some Vegan paradise is utter bollocks, as per above.




Huseng said:
In the end, Veganism is merely a political salve for the consciences of granola-munching, yoga-studio going, petty bourgeois (as well as some Buddhists) in first-world countries that are completely out of touch with the realities of how things are in places like Haiti, Appalachia (where the poorest Americans live) and Golok, for example where every calory counts.
This is a bit harsh and inconsiderate of the many vegans in the world, many of whom do not fit into such a character type.

Malcolm wrote:
Yup, well, I think Vegans are harsh, unkind, shrill and elitist, as well as dietarily neurotic.




Huseng said:
In other words, without the abundant waste of first-world nations, a Vegan diet is not even possible.
Nonsense. It was possible in pre-modern times, it is possible now.

Malcolm wrote:
You have no evidence of any vast community of Vegan peoples living anywhere. The fact is that animal protein in some form or another has been a substantial portion of the diet every premodern society we can think of (and for good reason, it has more energy than grain).



Huseng said:
You might argue "The Chinese Buddhists have been doing this for centuries" well, my reply to that is that people in Chinese Buddhist monasteries are not paid to work in rice paddies (they are forbidden to) they are paid to pray and be vinayadharas.
First of all, it wasn't just China. Japan, Korea and Vietnam all had Buddhists living vegan lifestyles, both for religious convictions and economic reasons.

Malcolm wrote:
They could afford to support minority populations in elitist institutions.



Huseng said:
In pre-modern Japan for example there simply was no dairy. I don't know about eggs, but I imagine with the sentiments expressed in Buddhist texts it would have been minimal given that bodhisattva aspirants are forbidden from keeping both animals and slaves. Ruling all meat and fish, people would have been vegan. They lived just fine, both Buddhist layman and monk alike.

Malcolm wrote:
Sorry, but Japanese people ate fish and other sea food and have done so for millenia -- and prior to the introduction of Buddhism ate many other kinds of animals as witnessed by Buddhist imperial edicts. And for example, Jodo Sinshu permits meat eating and so on.



Huseng said:
They are a supported community and their fortunes and ability to maintain the life style you admire and emulate depends completely on the wealth of the supporting population.
Any monastic population, even the meat eating ones, rely on the generosity of a supporting population.

Malcolm wrote:
Not always, in Tibet, monasteries were landed estates that produced their own grain and so on. Monasteries as farms were also common in India, according to scandalized reports about Mahayana monks met by Chinese pilgrims. Basically, the Chinese "proto-vegans" were fanatic converts.


Huseng said:
Likewise, the Vegan lifestyle depends on the choices and abundance of the very industrial agricultural system you are criticizing. Without that system, without the ability to get fresh vegetables, etc. year round, the Vegan diet is impossible. The Vegan diet is primarily an urban diet for a wealthy elite (like monks in a monastery) who can afford fresh vegetables, fruit, nuts, and grain 365 days a year (and good medical care when their health crashes from a bad diet).
None of this is true. Even in pre-modern times vegetarian populations generally got by the winters without dying off from malnutrition. This was long before refrigeration and industrial food production. Pickles, grains, dried fruits, field vegetables, noodles, teas and various other food products provided sufficient nutrition then, just as they would now.

Malcolm wrote:
You really need to read ancient medical texts from India, China, and so on. Then you will understand that this is pretty much of a fantasy.

Pre-modern Buddhist communities in East Asia were effectively vegan and they existed for many centuries before any industrial infrastructure was developed.

Namdrol said:
The crux of my arguments against eating meat were similar to Huseng's environmental, cruelty of treatment of animals, and so on. I still think those arguments are a valid reason for not supporting industrial agriculture in general -- which I endeavor not to do. I agree with Huseng that as Buddhists we need to be mindful of what is harmful. But I do not buy the argument that eating meat ipso facto makes on responsible for harming animals. That extreme was rejected by the Buddha and I also reject it based on reasoning.

Huseng said:
Such a teaching was given to the śrāvakas, not the bodhisattvas. As Daoxuan in the 7th century pointed out, the prohibitions against eating meat that is impure (having it killed for you, etc...), is an indication that the spirit of the teaching is to eventually forbid the consumption of meat when the disciples are suitable vessels to receive such a teaching.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, as we can see, there were Mahāyāna authors in India such as Bhavya who understood the Mahāyāna prohibitions against eating meat differently than the way you are portraying it. In his commentary he mentions by name these sutras:Hastikakṣya mahāyāna sūtra, Mahāmegha, Lanka, Āryāṅgulimālīya-mahāyāna-sūtra, etc.

To refute the literal interpretation of these sūtras, which he considers interpretable, he runs through the impurity argument advanced by some who assert that because the meat comes from semen and blood, it produces impurities of the body in greater excess. Bhavya points out that also milk and butter come from the bodies of animals, hence they too should produce more impurities.

He then addresses the argument consuming meat makes one a harmer of beings by necessity. As I said, he reduces the argument to whether one directly harms a being as follows "if one eats meat after creating suffering for a creature's body, it will possess a fault, but since there is no mind in the flesh of a creature's body at the time its meat is eaten, if no suffering arises where is the sin to be seen? Just as there is not the slightest suffering to a creature when one uses mother of pearl, bezoars of fish and oxen, peacock feathers, ox tails, teeth, bones, hide and so on, just as there is no harm what so ever when using fruit, water, and so on, in the same way there at the time of eating meat there is no fault because one is not engaging in harming. If there were harm, then also cremating a corpse would be sinful."


Huseng said:
The śrāvakas seek arhatship, in which case unconditional concern for all sentient beings is not a major concern. The whole point of such a spiritual pursuit is liberation for oneself, not to free all beings from suffering.

Malcolm wrote:
Minds cannot be harmed, only bodies. And Avihimsa is a concern for all Buddhists. But you cannot harm something that is not alive and has no feelings.



Huseng said:
According to numerous Mahāyāna texts meat eating was forbidden by a Buddha (not necessarily Śākyamuni) as it destroys the seed of buddhahood, among other issues.

Malcolm wrote:
If "the seed of Buddhahood" could be destroyed, then you are admitting there is a class of persons called icchantika. You don't really want to do that, do you? Not only that, you are admitting that Buddhanature is something conditioned, subject to impermanence. Since most of the sutras that teach strict vegetarianism are also tathagatagarbha sutras, this obviously means that strict proclamations made about meat eating need interpretation since you cannot have an unconditioned Buddhanature on the one hand, and one that can be destroyed on the other.


Huseng said:
This makes sense given that a bodhisattva should as much as possible avoid creating the causes and conditions for the intentional slaughter of animals.

Malcolm wrote:
No, it is the same as for shravakas. Bodhisattvas should avoid harming sentient beings where possible.


Huseng said:
If you purchase meat then you are supporting the causes and conditions for the intentional slaughter of animals. Agriculture harms living beings, too, but unless pesticides are specifically applied to the crop, this killing is usually not intentional.

Malcolm wrote:
Organic agriculture uses pesticides, they are simply less toxic to people than industrial pesticides -- but no less toxic to insects. And you just made an argument for the compassion of shravakas -- bhikṣus are probihited from a) digging in the ground since it harms animals and b) traveling during the rains seaons because of harming small creatures. But they are not prohibeted from eating meat as long as it is pure in three ways. Why? Because the criteria of what is permitted and what is not permitted is directly related to personally harming sentient beings.



Huseng said:
Just as driving a car one hopefully does not have the intention of driving into and over living beings like insects.




Malcolm wrote:
The following quote from the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra merely reinforces Bhavya's point:

“Mahāmati! I see that because of the habits of sentient beings from the beginningless past to eat meat, they crave the flavour of meat and mutually kill and harm one another.

Clearly the intent is encourage lay people not to butcher meat personally.

Huseng said:
However, I'm sure you're well aware of these arguments. Whether you eat meat or not is up to you. I'm not commanding anyone here to give up meat, but providing my own opinion and citations of sūtra which I rely on.

Malcolm wrote:
Bhavya was an Indian master. He was certainly quite aware of the issues here since he address this in his Tarkajvala in detail. He obviously thought the reasoning of the advocates of an absolute prohibition of meat eating were mistaken and unreasonable, and that their arguments did not actually adress the true intent of the Mahāyāna sutras that seem to say meat eating is never acceptable.


Huseng said:
There are sūtra references in the Mahāyāna canon, at least in East Asia, which prohibit the consumption of even eggs and milk.

Malcolm wrote:
These can be safely considered apocryphal since Indians would never dream of not conusming milk products.

Huseng said:
Again, it is up to the individual. Even if you pay no karmic debt for consuming meat, by purchasing it you're supporting the economy of meat production, which requires animals to be slaughtered for profit.

Malcolm wrote:
If you drive a car you are supporting the economy of meat production which depends upon oil from top to bottom. No oil, no huge meat industry. And that is just a fact. In fact if you shop at any market, you are supporting the meat industry, if you buy grain, you are supporting producers of grain which is fed to animals in feedlots.

If you decide to buy only clothes made of artificial fibers, you are supporting the oil industry which is supporting the this industry and that industry.

If your criteria (and it is) is to cease using any product that harms any creature anywhere, this is impossible Even if you think there is precedent for this in a few Mahāyāna sutras, the sutras you have chosen are not sutras that are only to be read one way or can only be read one way, as Bhavya shows.

If you want to be a Vegan, fine, no problem -- but there is little or no justification for it from a Buddhist point of view. In fact all the Indian sutras encourage use of dairy, the very same ones that reject the consumption of meat. So therefore, the Vegan diet, even by strict vegetarian standards, is not supported in Buddhist sutras of Indian provenance. This being the case, if you try to justify it (a Vegan diet) on the basis of Buddhist sutras you will wind up trapping yourself in a morass of contradictions -- for example, excusing agriculture and travelling during the rains season when it is forbidden to Buddhist monks, but insisting that no one should eat meat even through it is permitted for shravakas and those who follow secret mantra.

If you want to be a Vegan, you can only "justify" it on purely secular grounds, and even then, not very adequately.

If there is no karmic debt connected with eating meat (that satisfies the criteria that one was not connected with inflicting harm on the animal), as you admit, then one can, as a Buddhist, eat meat and still engage in decisions and actions which limit one's personal participation in industrial agriculture without there being any contradiction at all.

In the end, Veganism is merely a political salve for the consciences of granola-munching, yoga-studio going, petty bourgeois (as well as some Buddhists) in first-world countries that are completely out of touch with the realities of how things are in places like Haiti, Appalachia (where the poorest Americans live) and Golok, for example where every calory counts.

Malcolm wrote:
A vegan diet is not inherently compassionate nor does it inherently make people compassionate. It also is not inherently tasty (that depends on the cook), it is not necessarily healthful (and can be quite the opposite in fact), that depends on one's constitution, age, and so on.

And quite frankly, I don't see vegans refusing to drive in cars and refusing to use public transportation because they are upset by the all the insects that are crushed and splatted by moving vehicles.

Veganism is definitely more in tune with Jain POV. But we are not Jains, we are Buddhists, and as such, Buddha rejected the extreme asceticism of Jains as well as criticisms of Devadatta.

Now, I have no problem with people choosing to be vegan, that is their choice. But I do have a problem with people asserting a vegan diet is eo ispo "Buddhist", because it is not.

Eating meast is not wrong providing you niether saw it killed, heard of being killed on your indivdual behalf, or was directly involved in killing it personally.

Harming sentient beings is wrong. Meat does not have sensation, it is inert. By the time meat has arrived on your plate, there is no mind there.

If your argument revolves around the process of harm caused to sentient beings by meat production, you must eo ipso apply the same argument to the production of rice, soy, and so on.

There is no need to posit a mysterious central asian origin. Their origin is found in the seventeen tantras. The understanding of the seventeen tantras is wedded with a Tibetan (and perhaps earlier Indian) understanding of human anatomy based on Dissection. Tibetans not only inheritied descriptions of dissections from Hellenic Medicine; unlike Indians and Chinese culture, they did not have the same taboo around cutting up bodies. The Tibetan doctors therefore had a better grasp of anatomy in general than Indian and Chinese doctors from an early period in the history of Tibetan Medicine.

This isn't pre-modern times. My opposition to meat consumption is also on the grounds that it is now industrially produced, and not just a yak in the mountains licking the moss. Industrial meat production is horrible for the environment, so I would oppose it just as much as I would oppose nuclear power and hacking down the rain forest.

What does "pure in three ways" mean?

Malcolm wrote:
It means meat that has not been killed for you (i.e. by a host knowing you are coming to banquet, for example); that you did not kill or ordered to be killed; or meat from an animal that you observed being killed.

Some people and even some masters think that meat in supermarkets is included in the second category.

As I already pointed out, the Mahāyāna master Bhavya points out in his Madhyamakahṛdayakārikā:

Therefore, permitted meat, and so on,
must be held to be faultless;
eating such meat possesses no fault
beause at that time no creature is harmed.

He has quite extensive reasoning for ascertaining this.

You may feel free from karma, but there will never be a time when animals are not slaughtered for food. This is just a fact. Get used to it. And as long as that is true, Buddhists may continue to eat meat understanding that it is pure in three ways.

Huseng said:
Buddhists may do a lot of things that are unwholesome. The lot of them are not enlightened and still subject to extreme cravings for foods like meat. However, as has been taught in countless scriptures and treatises it is best to avoid eating meat, not only for one's own sake, but for the sake of other persons and animals. This is the conduct of bodhisattvas. Eating meat with the assurances it is pure in three ways is conduct suitable for a śrāvaka, whose purpose is personal liberation, not the liberation of all sentient beings.

You may follow the śrāvaka conduct. You may also follow the path of the bodhisattva.

Malcolm wrote:
Or I can follow the conduct of tantric practitioner, where there are no restrictions concerning diet.

That being said, if your heart does not permit you to eat meat, than don't. But don't get all preachy and fundamentalist about it -- that is the path of Devadatta.

Even so, the fundamental feature of bodhisattva conduct is intention, not rules.

Bodhisattvas engage in a lot of different conduct, some of them eat meat. For example, if eating meat makes it easier to introduce someone to Mahāyāna, then I will eat meat. I will drink alchohol. Etc.

If I need to eat meat because I am healing from an injury, I will.

If normal people think we are Hari Krishnas, they will not be interested in Dharma.

Even Shabkar, who was famous for his detailed refutation of eating meat, did not try to force people not to eat meat. One of his main concerns was the example Tibetan monasteries set when they ordered animals on the hoof for the monasteries. He felt this was very wrong (it is) and this was one of his main targets. Not nomads who could not in any case read his texts and for whom being vegetarian is really not possible.

For such people, there are Mahāyāna fast day vows. They can be vegetarian once a day. And many Tibetans do follow the practice of Tibetan Lent i.e. avoiding meat during the fourth month, Vaisaka.

It is ok to to encourage people not to eat meat. But it will never work to try and prohibit it.

Giving up animal products is just as much about the producers as it is about the animals. Those butchers ply their trade (a wrong livelihood) because there is an economy for their product.

He also did not accept the Yogacara sutras as "pure" (the primary source of the eating meat will send you to hell). So you see, in Indian Buddhism there was considerable latitude for for accepting and rejecting sutras based on whether you think they reasonable or not.

Buddhists in Tibet and China, etc., lacked the sort of "on the ground" perspective of India sutra text composition, and thus tended to accept everything that came out of India and tried in various ways to reconcile Buddhists sutras.

In India therefore, we can understand that there were Mahāyānists, Madhyamakas, who adhered to one group of sutras, who ate meat; and another group, Yogacāras, who did not eat meat, adhering to another group of sutras.

You are conflating ultimate truth analysis with conventional truth. You cannot explain away the contaminated nature of phenomena on the basis of their emptiness.

Someone who is below the path of seeing would be extremely concerned, and should be extremely concerned with the contaminated nature of phenomena since they have no methods to deal with this apart from realizing emptiness. And further, on the impure stages, in post-equipoise, they still have to cope with the fact that phenomena appear contaminated and they have no specific practices for dealing with this.

We say these things because we want people to understand the difference between a rapid path and slow path since we are Mahāyānists and we want everyone to acheive Buddhahood as fast as possible. In the end, of course, everyone is free to make up their own mind.

Buddhahood requires two accumulations, whether one does that slowly or rapidly is up to oneself. I think that people who believe they are going to realize arhatship let alone stream entry by practicing Theravada or the first bhumi in this lifetime by practicing common Mahāyāna are deeply kidding themselves.

IN terms of Mahāyāna, outside of Vajrayāna methods there is no way to accumulate the necessary merit and wisdom heaps required for full awakening.

It is rather stupid to ignore the fact that Buddhism borrowed and repurposed many elements of a shared Indian cultural heritage or to try and explain it away with some complicated religious reasoning.

Sang offerings, Sur offerings and so on don't exist in Indian culture, so it would rather dull to refuse to acknowledge that many native Tibetan, as well as some Chinese rituals, were converted to Buddhist use under the general rubric of "tö" (gto) rites. There is a whole list of these things for example, in the Karling Shitro in the section on cheating death. Mipham has a book where he discloses many of these kinds of tö rites (in connection with elemental calculation) which formerly were closely guarded secrets because many of them indeed would be considered sorcery and given their worldly origin, were sorcerous at one time. Then there is the famous book of calculation called the Svarodaya tantra, a Shaivaite tantra preserved in the Tengyur, which is a work mainly concerned with military prediction, heavily used by the Fifth Dalai Lama, and extensively commented on by Mipham.

We have to recognize, if we are really being honest, that Buddhism makes use of many "cultural rituals" that do not ultimately come from Buddhas, but are adapted by Buddhas and other awakened beings to suit the needs and proclivities of sentient beings. Thus the four activities were borrowed into Buddhism when tantric Buddhism began to spread in India in the 7th century. You can even find polemical arguments about why Buddhist fire pujas are "better" than Vedic fire pujas, when the Brahmins began to complain that Buddhists were horning in on their game.

We can try to give them the proper explanation, there is no guarantee that they will accept it, they may even accuse us of trying to confound the true meaning of our statements!

The best thing would be to "re-secret" these practices, but this is currently impossible.

There are four activities. The fourth, abhicāra, mngon spyod or the activity of destruction will certainly seem like tantric sorcery to anyone but Vajrayāna Buddhists. Incidentally, the four activities come from Indian Vedic culture, and in that context, abhicāra is definitely black magic.

Using the Buddha staues as a measure, you can see that the seated body is somewhere betwee 30 to 36 inches high. When I am seated, butt to crown, I am 39 inches.

We don't need to drag the body out, we just need to see daily pictures....

Title: Re: Taoist Origin of Tantric Energy System
Content:
Astus said:
In the introduction of Peter Alan Roberts' new book "Mahamudra and Related Instructions" it says that the energy system as it appeared in India with the chakras and nadis originates from Central Asia and it has a Taoist source. Anyone to provide more information on this?

The text says,

"The candali practice also involves the physiology of sexuality, generally described from a male perspective. It corresponds with far more ancient Taoist practices, which have a greater number of pressure points in breath control, called jade locks, and a specific female morphology that has the retention of menstruation as the parallel to the male retention of ejaculation. Candali and the cakra system appeared in the Buddhist tradition subsequent to a period of Buddhist and Taoist coexistence in Central Asia. The cakras, literally "wheels," are the points where subsidiary channels branch off into the body, but they were unknown in India before the latter centuries of the first millennium, when they first appeared in both Saivism and Buddhism."

Malcolm wrote:
He is mistaken. Cakras and Nadis appear in pre-Buddhist upanishads. The famed number 72,000 nadis occurs in the Brihadaryanika, look up Hita. The early mentions of vāyus, cakras and nadis are all to be found in the twopre- Buddhist Upanishads, and perhaps other early Puranic literature I have not seen. There is no reason in this instance to assume an extra-Indian origin for these theories.

Candali Yoga is based again an Upanishadic verse from the Candoga which is frequently cited in Buddhist texts discussing the difference between Buddhist tantric practices and Hindu corrollaries. In actuality, Candali Yoga is based on the Indian concept of the burnt offering.

Moreover, Indian doctors were certainly aware of arteries and veins, the difference between them and so on. If anything, the notion of channels and cakras comes from Ayurveda.

Please near in mind I am not opposed to influences of this sort on genera principle -- for example, the Chinese certainly invented pulse diagnosis, which spread to Tibet and finally to India. The Greeks invered Urinalysis, which spread to Tibetan and India (via Unnani), and so on. Mercury preperation certainly originated in China, and only spread to India later, as David Gordon White shows, based on Needleman. But there is no valid reason to suppose that cakra and nadi theory is based on Taoism.

The teachings I received on uposotha vows emphasized that the motivation for taking these vows is to generate causes to attain Buddhahood (as distinct from Sravakayana 'attasila' day vows), but the means was very much involved with renunciation. In the formula with which one takes the vows says " just as the Buddhas etc.. in the past have practiced..". There is a reference to past arhats (Buddha arhats) but it was never said or implied that the reason that one takes the vows is to honor the conduct of the Arhats.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course, the Mahāyāna fast days vows also contain the intention that you mention -- but the reason for doing so is it emulate the conduct of an Arhat, at least one day a month.

But nevertheless, this is part of common Mahāyāna.

As to renunciation no longer being a viable method, well we better rush off and tell HHDL, HH Karmapa, and all the monks practicing in al the monasteries.

Malcolm wrote:
All of these monks are Vajrayāna monks. They may bear the external characteristics of bhikṣus, but the path of renunciation is not the path they have chose for themselves. You would have to be a monastic or a lay person in the Theravadin tradition or the Chinese tradition to follow the path of renunciation in a precise way.


mudra said:
Actually quite a few of them are doing fine as monks. Sure it is perhaps more distracting in modern settings, but then again that mostly serves to separate the goats from the sheep (or however the saying goes)...

Malcolm wrote:
We tend to think that the most important thing that monks do avoid sexual relations. Monks also are not supposed to lie, steal the slightest thing (which means paying all duty and so on when they cross borders) etc., not remain alone with women in rooms, etc. The reason why the conduct of a Tibetan monk is kep secret from lay people is so that lay people will not criticize monks. Part of the reason behind this is that all Tibetan monks are Mahāyāna monks, and thus, if they choose to break one of their vows for a reason, some one might misunderstand. Another part of the reason for this is that all Tibetan monks are Vajrayāna monks, and so if their conduct seems to be not in keeping with Hinayāna vows, they might get into trouble. Vajrayāna monks are not under the same restrictions as Hinayāna monks.

And the Karmapa is into playing first person shooter video games like Halo to relax.

When one understands the fundamental principle of Vajrayāna conduct is to engage sense objects and enjoy them for one's own pleasure (as a mandala of deities), it changes the game of how one understands a Vajrayāna monastic's conduct. The monastic thing is merely an outer show. It is not the essence of practice.

"Nyungne" i.e "remaining in the fast". is a Carya tantra purification practice and like all tantra from carya on up, one creates oneself as a deity, engages in offerings of sense objects to oneself as well as the front created deity and so on. So it qualifies as part of the "path that does not abandon the basis" i.e. Mantrayāna.

Mahāyānaparinivana sūtra states:

"The Bhagavan replied to Kashyapa: "Protecting and upholding the sublime dharma, that is the cause and condition of acheiving the vajra body. Kashyapa, through the cause and condition of having protected the sublime dharma in the past, one will always possess the vajrabody and it will never perish. Son of a good family, when protecting the sublime dharma one does not protect the five disciplines (pañcaśila); one also does not guard conduct, but instead taking up arms such as  swords, bows and arrows, spears and so on is the completely pure discipline of a bhikṣu"

And:

"Son of a good family, lay persons who protect the dharma should take up arms, protecting and guarding the bhikṣus who guard the dharma. Just protecting the five disciplines does not make one a so-called "person of the Mahāyāna". Even if one does not protect the five disciplines but protects the sublime dharma, one is called a Mahāyāni. If one protects the sublime dharma, one should take up arms and protect dharma teachers."

Tibetans see them as collaborators and informers which they themselves don't deny any more and if TGE did any less, there will be blood in the opposite direction. They are not a real big problem as they did their damage about 60 years ago. In a way where it matters most, Tibet, they have self destructed. Even then it wasn't just them or Mao but other forces too. As far as Mongolia is concerned, things can change either for worse or the better rapidly with populist trends and the wrong/right figurehead. Lets see, I think it will be OK there in the end but it's not key like Tibet in so many ways.

So for example, if I find a number of obscure tantras embeded in a terma cycle that are also found in the NGB, as I have, I have to assume the terton is borrowing them into his collection.

This is an old article I read long before and magnus, whom I agree with here in his interpretation of Sam, posted it here before too if I remember correctly. Sam is not the type of person who would draw such radical conclusions based on almost nothing. He is very respectful and also conservative. While he hypothesizes sometimes, he never states things as fact without evidence and is always flexible. He states all the facts he deems relevant often contradictory. That's just not his style. People can post on his blog and he answers honestly, so I don't buy any of that interpretation. Also he has read widely, including Samten Karmay and others, who state the texts how Dzogchen was actually banned by local rulers in North India and never was properly established openly before it went North and lots lots more. This is a big field not just summed up in a few pages of an article. Attacking Ekajati's protected lineage merely after mis-reading a short article when someone just finished their PhD is going over the top for probably other personal reasons.

Malcolm wrote:
The seventeen tantras cannot be firmly dated earlier than their initial production by Dangma Lhungyal. Between him and Nyanban Tingzin Zangpo there is only a single master, Bey Lodro Wangchug (one Rinchen Bar is also sometimes added to the list). We can positively date the end of Chetsun Senge Wangchug's life to the early 12th century.

Supposedly, Lodro Wangchug concealed the Seventeen Tantras in Samye, and Dangma Lhungyal removed them from hiding at Samye and gave them to Chetsun.

The Vima Nyinthig is the earliest text to list the seventeen tantras and their subject matter. For the most part, the Vima Nyinthig is the terma of Chetsun. Thus, teachings like the Tshig gsum gnad rdeg, etc., also cannot be dated earlier than the late11th --early 12th century.

These are the kinds of facts that limit textual analysis. You can only go by when a text actually appears.

There are three masters between Vimala and Chestun, and since tradition holds that Nyingthig tradition was a single lineage until Chetsun, we would have to accept that these three or four masters passed on several thousand handwritten folios i.e. the several hundred pages of the seventeen tantras as well as their lenghty commentaries, between roughly 800 AD and the early 12th century when Chetsun passed on his lineage to Zhangton Tashi Dorje who lived between 1097 and 1167 around 1123 when they met. Thus, the latest date for the seventeen tantras is 1123. Obviously they were composed earlier, since the Vima Nyinthig is based on them.

Zhangton's son, Nima Bum, wrote the earliest independent commentary on the Vima Nyinthig. It is a very interesting text, and is dense with citations from the seventeen tantras, and is the model upon which Longchenpa based his own Tshig Don Mdzod. Nyibum was also a disciple of Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen and was closely connected with the Sakya school. The Nyinthig teachings were a family lineage for three generations i.e. Tashi Dorje, Nyibum and his nephew, Guru Jober.

The commentaries for the seventeen tantras are first mentioned by Longchenpa and so cannot date later than he. It seems unlikely they were actually authored by Vimalamitra, but who knows. They were mostly likely composed in the early 13th century since they must have been known to Kumararaja. Perhaps they were composed by Nyibum, since he was known to be a great scholar, his title was "Zhang mkhas pa" i.e. "Zhang Pandita". Or there were three masters between Nyibum and Kumararaja, Jober, Sangye Gyab and Melong Dorje, all thirteen century masters. Anyone of them too could have composed these commentaries.

Jober, was known to have many disciples. He passed away in 1258.

The Khandro Nyinthig was produced in the mid-to late thirteenth century after Jober started teachings Vima Nyinthig widely. We do not have good dates for Pema Ledretsal, the terton for the Khandro Nyinthig. All we know is that he was active in the mid to later thirteenth century and that he did not life a long life.

The Khandro Nyinthig presents itself as a commentary of one tantra specifically, i.e., the Longsal Tantra. Thus this tantra predates the Khandro Nything but is later than the Seventeen Tantras, it was probably composed in the early 13th century. The Khandro Nyinthig is the earliest text that mentions the Longsal Tantra. This tantra summarizes all the topics of the Vima Nyinthig and the seventeen tantras into 113 chapters, giving detailed instruction for practicing creation stage, completion stage as well as Dzogchen tregchö and thögal. Most later Nyingthig termas atrributed to Padmasambhava cite the Longsal tantra extensively. The Khandro Nyinthig also begins the tradition of six short tagdrol tantras. Notably, it has a concise version of the Single Son of the All the Buddhas, originally found in Ser Yig Can of the Vima Nyinthig.

We can trace the ideas and their spread pretty well after Chetsun. We cannot trace the origin of these texts at all well, and so have to rely on the history of the seventeen tantras and the Vima Nyinthig as presented in the Lo rgyus chen mo since this is our earliest source of information about this tradition. We have to admit that objectively, we really do not know anything about this tradition prior to Senge Wangchuk.

Begin positive actions even though delayed. 
Investigate in the beginning, then commit for future benefits.

Support one’s relatives and employees, look for a long while at [those who have been] kind in the past. 
Respect one’s elders, i.e. one’s teacher, father, uncle and so on. 
One mind should be in accord with one’s countrymen, friends, and constant companions. 
In business be strict; when necessary, behave liberally. 
Accept defeat if mistaken; be measured if victorious. 
If one is an expert, diminish one’s arrogance, if one is wealthy, understand it is sufficient. 
Do not scorn inferiors, do not be jealous of superiors. 
Do not depend on evil men, do not make enemies of sorcerers or priests. 
Do not use the wealth of others, and avoid [causes for] retribution and taking oaths. 
Plant one’s feet to have no regrets. 
Do not give power to evil persons.

I didn't. I merely pointed out some statistics around gun violence, what guns are for (killing), and the consequences of using them (death and injury), and that it is much harder to use a gun for self-defense, or even hunting, than most people seem to understand. I have a lot of experience with guns, compared to most Buddhists I know.

Incidentally, Padme -- if you want a gun for self-defense, that will really work when you need it to, don't mess around with a rifle or a pistol. Get a 12 guage shotgun. Learn how to shoot it i.e. pull it tight to your shoulder when firing it, or you will get a large bruise.

Shotguns intended for defensive use have barrels as short as 18 inches (46 cm) for private use (the minimum shotgun barrel length allowed by law in the United States without special permits; most manufactures use a minimum length of 18.5 inches, to give leeway in the case of a measuring dispute). Barrel lengths of less than 18 inches (46 cm) as measured from the breechface to the muzzle when the weapon is in battery with its action closed and ready to fire, or have an overall length of less than 26 inches (66 cm) are classified as short barreled shotguns ("sawn-off shotguns") under the 1934 National Firearms Act and are heavily regulated.
Shotguns used by military, police, and other government agencies are exempted from regulation under the National Firearms Act of 1934, and often have barrels as short as 12 to 14 inches (30 to 36 cm), so that they are easier to handle in confined spaces. Non-prohibited private citizens may own short-barreled shotguns by purchasing a $200 tax stamp from the Federal government and passing an extensive background check (state and local laws may be more restrictive). Defensive shotguns sometimes have no buttstock or will have a folding stock to reduce overall length even more when required.

I came across the following passage in the book "The Vision of Buddhism" by the late professor  Roger J. Corless:
When the shinjin has arisen, and the nembutsu says itself, it occurs jinen, spontaneously, naturally, or automatically. Jinen is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese tzu-jan, "selfly,"  which is a popular term in Taoism.  It came to be used by Buddhists for the manner in which Buddhas do without doing.   It is a more or less exact equivalent of the Tibetan lhundrup, the spontaneously activity of the Vajra Realm.  The difference between Jinen and lhundrup is not in the spontaneity, but in how one obtains it.  In Vajrayana, one must progress through the stages before spontaneous action takes over.  Shinran found that, in his experience, Amitabha picked him up and placed him directly in the spontaneous energy mode.
Is there any merit in what he says or is he reaching quite a bit here?

In some prev post you said you didn't think Maitreyanatha gave the five treatises to Asanga, that Asanga wrote them and attributed them.

Malcolm wrote:
I never said that. This is a common opinion but it is not mine. My opinion is that Maitreyanath was a human teacher, a Pandita, who wrote the five treatises. His identification with Bodhisattva Maitreya is really quite late as is the story of Asanga's retreat and encounter with Bodhisattva Maitreya.

My opinion is that after that Maitreya chapter was added to the Perfection of Wisdom sutra sometime after the 6th century (mostly likley as a polemical response to Madhyamaka commentaries on Abhisamaya-alamkara that were critical of Yogacara), the indentity of Bodhisattva Maitreya and Maitreyanatha were conflated because the Maitreya chapter adds Yogacara specific themese to the PP sutras. However, we can be sure that the Maitreya Chapter is a later interpolation because it is missing from earlier, pre-sixth century translations of the PP sutras.

Haribhadra (8th century) was the first author on record to assert the author of the Abhisamayalamkara, and by extension, the other four treatises to be Bodhisattva Maitrya.

Bhavabhata and Bhavyakirit both hold that "This teacher (i.e. Śakyamuni) having attained buddhahood in the beginningless past taught the Cakrasamvara tantras, but later, after becoming the son of Śuddodana, did not teach it. Their reasoning holds that since Cakrasamvara is continually practiced by the heros and yoginis of the twenty four countries, even when eon forms and perished (the twenty four countries) do not form and perish so [the Cakrasamvara] does not disappear. Even though other dharmas may have also been taught in the beginning, since they are destroyed by the formation and perishing of the eon, since they disappear during the interval, they must be taught again by Śākyamuni.

A special feature of Cakrasamvara is that unlike Guhyasamaja, Kalacakra, Hevajra, etc., the mandala of Cakrasamvara is never withdrawn it is not necessary for Śākyamuni to teach it again as it would redundant.

In the book, if you read the section, HH points out that he is a good shot, as he grew up practicing on the 13th's rifle. So because he is a good shot, he can be confident he is only inflicting pain and not killing or seriously injuring. If you have an issue with this, take it up with HH. I have confidence in his grasp of the Dharma, I don't know about you.

I don't have an issue with it -- everyone's karma is their own.

I also understand that once a pellet or bullet leaves a barrel it is not under your control anymore.

I asked you whether you had ever shot at anything, etc. You did not answer.

See, coming from an "sportsman" family, I am "gun literate" -- my dad took me out and taught me how to shoot, handle and clean guns when I was seven, in 1969. When I was eight, I was allowed to go out hunting by myself with a 22. I have over the years shot bb guns, air rifles, 22's, 222 deer rifles, 30-06 bolt action rifles, 20 and 12 gauge shotuns, AR-15's, and even Kalishnakov semi-automatics. I have killed birds and other small animals. I also used to fish, also. Never shot a pistol, though, not that I can remember.

One generally speaking becomes good a shooting targers, so if it every comes up, you can hit what you aim at. You usually only aim at living things either to injure or kill.

Injuring sentient beings is not generally consistent with the bodhisattva vow, though there are of course exceptions.

You keep talking about swords -- well, at least with a sword, to use one you take a lot of personal risk -- you cannot harm or kill someone at a distance with a sword. And Golog is filled with bandits.

Saraha II was a fletcher, but I don't think he was a hunter.

Especially taser guns; with those there is definitely no intention of killing, they are not designed for killing at all -- just immobilizing the assailant until law enforcement can come to take him away.

The target with real guns in LE training is NOT the head or heart, but the center mass - torso since it is the largest area with the least movement, but for defense, the lower torso with a low caliber could be used. In such instances, a fatality is unlikely to occur.

A non-fatal abdomen shot with a low caliber bullet will not stop a determined attacker. And, given the poor accuracy of handguns, that person is likely to be close enough to harm you.

It is not easy to shoot someone who is attacking you, contrary to popular beleif.

Attacking animals are usually easier to shoot, because they generally engage in a display of aggression before attacking.

Someine intent on harming you is unlikely to be stopped by a non-lethal round, and will be angered by it, actually.

If you are not prepared to kill someone with a handgun bought for self-defense, don't buy one.

If you think you can guarantee that you will be able to disable someone with a gunshot in self-defense, think again. Not only is it hard to shoot a stationary target with a handgun, it is even harder to shoot a moving target. Anyone who has handeled guns knows that I am telling the truth.

Generally speaking, the outside range of accuracy of a handgun is 50 yards.

A healthy man can cover this distance in under 10 seconds.

I was able to poke him in the eyes, squeeze out from under him and escape. I ran like hell to the nearest Korean market where I called the police. Never occurred to me to freeze. How do you get this "most people" statistic? Plenty of people run from attacks, give me a break.

No. I am pointing out that all of this stuff about night goggles, etc., is all a fantasy.

When guns are involved, it is much harder to shoot at someone than you might imagine. We were talking about using guns to defend oneself.

Have you ever tried to shoot at an animal? Have you ever gone hunting? Killing is not so easy. I used to hunt when I was a boy. It is even harder to shoot a human being, without training that is. And what Buddhist wants training in how to kill?

Further, handguns are difficult to use. It is hard to shoot one accurately, even at close range. The larger a handgun is, the less accurate it is, without extensive, and regular training.

Shale oil, tar sands and so on is incredibly expensive to extract, like 4:1.

Also, as demand for oil drops because of a lack of demand from manufacturing because of oil scarcity (when oil become too scarce, industries that depend on it (plastics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, industrial agriculture, etc.) will fail unilaterally, the price of oil will drop precipitously, and this drop in price will make these hard to access types of oil even less profitable.
