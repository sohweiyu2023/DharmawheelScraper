But until very recently, voters didn’t seem all that convinced that Biden could win. In poll after poll, comparatively more voters said they thought Trump would win reelection in November. Now, though, that view may be shifting.

Over the past two and a half months, the share of voters who said they expect Trump to win has fallen from about 45 percent to around 40 percent in polling by The Economist/YouGov, as the chart below shows, while Biden’s share has slowly ticked up to where Trump’s numbers are.

Of course not. The main Dzogchen practice is the direct perception of your own state. Even guru yoga is a practice that works with mind, rather than pristine consciousness -- even Ati guru yoga. Thus, guru yoga is a method related to the second phrase of Garab Dorje, "decide one thing/remain without doubt." One uses guru yoga, or rushan, etc., to introduce oneself to the mind essence over and over as many times as one needs until one has attained some stability in recognizing it and sustaining that recognition.

Once you have "decided on one thing/no longer remain in doubt", then you do not remain passive, you shift your focus to "continue in the confidence of liberation/continue in that state," relying principally on the primary methods of the Great Perfection found in so called "man ngag lde," trekchö and thögal.

Two dozen more officers soon streamed out of the building to join them.

Several dozen protesters stood on the sidewalk and street near officers. Officers shot some type of less-than-lethal projectiles to break up the crowd around 11:25 p.m. It was not clear what precipitated officers’ actions.

Officers then pressed toward the crowd, shooting impact munitions and setting off devices that emit gas and smoke to force people to keep walking north on Third Avenue past the jail and then past the courthouse. Other officers in camouflage assembled on nearby Madison Street. As they pressed the crowd away from the buildings, the officers in camouflage walked beyond federal property and onto city streets.

Officers eventually formed a line on Third Avenue at Salmon Street, near the north end of the courthouse. Crowds of people gathered nearby on the other side of Salmon. Protesters pressed toward officers, and officers again set off devices that made loud noises and released gas, smoke and flashes.

Not because she is black, but because she is really, really smart. Basically, after Bush, we needed eight years of Obama to repair the damage the GOP did to our economy, etc., the last time around. This time around we will at least 24 years of Democratic administrations to repair the damage Donald Trump and his wrecking crew have inflicted on this nation. I sincerely hope that the GOP never wins another national election. If people are so stupid as to keep voting for the GOP, there is no help for them.

The "media" in this country has always had its partisan voices. The newspapers, barring opinion pages, only started to become a bit more objective in reporting since the early 20th century because they had to downplay partisanship in order to sell advertising.

What is the Dzogchen path from start to finish. I would like to understand the complete path from point A to Z and everything in between?

Is it different in each Nyingma school? Is there a completely linear path?

Sorry if this is somewhat confusing.

Malcolm wrote:
Do you mean is there a graded path of Dzogchen?

Yes and no.

Like all other Vajrayāna paths, one begins with receiving an empowerment or a so-called direct introduction. Then, depending on master and tradition, one either engages in common Vajrayāna preliminaries, or one moves directly to the uncommon Dzogchen preliminaries. One may or may not spend time practicing deity yoga.

The essential practice of Dzogchen teachings is guruyoga.

In order to survive a Trump Presidency, the rise of white nationalism, and widening income inequality, there needs to be a strong resistance.

Our resistance envisions a future where communities are empowered to create new solutions to present day problems, using direct action, political advocacy, and community development to inspire new people to get involved in politics and to create a united platform for progressive causes.  Portland has an opportunity to become a beacon of light, modeling to the world what a nonviolent resistance movement can truly look like.

What we observe in the nineteen-sixties is that there was a nontrivial number of white moderates who were open to policies that advanced racial equality, and were also very concerned about order. The needle that civil-rights activists were trying to thread was: How do you advance racial equality, and capture the attention of often indifferent or hostile white moderates outside of the South, and at the same time grow a coalition of allies? And over time the strategy that evolved was one of nonviolent protest, which actively sought to trigger police chiefs like Bull Connor [in Birmingham, Alabama,] to engage in spectacles of violence that attracted national media and would, in the language of the nineteen-sixties, “shock the conscience of the nation.” So it isn’t just nonviolence that is effective, but nonviolence met with state and vigilante brutality that is effective.

The fact is that the protestors in Portland and elsewhere are nonviolent and always have been. They are just following Gandhi's approach.

Queequeg said:
On May 21, some 2,500 marchers ignored warnings from police and made an unarmed advance on the Dharasana depot.

American journalist Webb Miller was on the scene, and he later described what followed. “Suddenly,” he wrote, “at a word of command, scores of native police rushed upon the advancing marchers and rained blows on their heads…Not one of the marchers even raised an arm to fend off the blows. They went down like ten-pins.”

Miller’s harrowing account of the beatings circulated widely in the international media, and was even read aloud in the U.S. Congress. Winston Churchill—no great fan of Gandhi—would later admit that the protests and their aftermath had “inflicted such humiliation and defiance as has not been known since the British first trod the soil of India.”

German is not my first language. That was part of the problem. Highly technical discussions in German would be a bridge too far and not enjoyable. I am also unsure whether to start with Classical Tibetan again or work through one of the modern spoken Tibetan courses first. There seem to be a couple of good courses for the spoken language in English, but only Wilson's Translating Buddhism from Tibetan for the classical language.

What for do you need the spoken Tibetan? You need a tandem partner then. And then is the question what you have to offer in exchange. I already found out that I am in a good position, since I speak high-German and I saw a Tibetan person on a Swiss Language partner side looking for high-German speaking parter.German seems to be sometimes a practical skill.You can only offer your mother-tongue on such sides. They all want a native speaker-partner.
But now I got: I need Kham dialect and what is if she speaks Lhasa dialect or whatever. There seems to be nothing like high-German or oxford English in Tibetan.

What I need is only the correct Kham-pronounciation for some words I know in Wylie.But I gave the big project up. It seems to be one of the most difficult languages in the world. I do not know why it is not on the official list for the most difficult languages.

I can't think of how to say this without sounding like I am "co opting" myself, but it actually connects to the identity politics thread, so I'm going to try to respond to the original article:

I hate to say it, but all this is actually not exclusively a Black issue. It's a Black-led movement to be sure, and for sure, black communities and people, and in particular young black men die more often at the hands of police, and certainly suffer disproportionately within the justice system in particular. As is often the case, Black communities are (by necessity) at the forefront of this kind of activism, but they are not the only one's with devastating experiences with the justice system, nor are they the only ones with a stake in the outcomes here. I grew up in a city where homeless people of a variety colors were regularly murdered by the police, and I'm sure still are.

The justice system as it stands now is terrible to a wide range of people (mainly poor - once you are poor you stand much more chance of becoming involved in "the system", for a host of reasons), to varying degrees. A homeless white drug addict suffers due to it's inequities, so does a mentally ill grandmother on SSI, so does the domestic violence victim not getting the proper help. All these people would undoubtedly suffer worse if they were Black, but the issues here affect everyone, other than those well-off and callous enough to not care.

Honestly, this stuff affects pretty much anyone who is poor and ends up doing time, or ends up being involved with the cops.

So I get where the author is coming from, spectacle-like white "ally" protests are definitely cringe worthy, and perhaps the people engaging in them are just dilettantes. However, as much as I respect that this movement has been initiated by BLM, it can't end by credentialing people to protest, everyone should care about reform  and overhaul of the justice system. If anything, the performative (I hate that word, but it fits here) type of "allyship" activism I've seen around some of the protests probably lends itself to stuff like the Naked White Yoga Lady protest. I love what BLM is doing, I have nothing but respect and support for their demands. I believe in reparations, and all the sorts of these things, but we need to move to model of shared values to protest over, not social permission to protest based on demographics.
I am proposing that we take the cause of Black Lives Matter into those places where tear gas and rubber bullets and federal agents cannot find us, and where there is less risk of spectacle distracting from our true aims. In boardrooms, in schools, in city councils, in the halls of justice, in the smoky backrooms of a duplicitous government — that is where we will finally dismantle the gears of the brutal, racist machine that has been terrorizing black Americans and hollowing out the moral character of this nation since its inception.
First of all, I have no idea what this means. People have already been trying to address systemic racism in city councils, schools etc. for most of my lifetime, and while there's been laudable work done, it hasn't done a thing to change the brutality of America's growing Police State. See this is the whole issue, this person (and rightfully so perhaps from their perspective) sees this as entirely a Black issue. Many people don't. I acknowledge that Black people and communities suffer the worst in the justice system, by far, and I acknowledge that they are often (again by necessity) at the forefront of reform efforts - this deserves acknowledgement...however, it is rotten for pretty much -all poor- people. If someone does not understand that, they fundamentally do not understand America, frankly. The "machine" is not only racist, and seeing it as only racist (which seems uniquely American, frankly) is missing some important nuance, in my opinion.

So criticize dumb protests, that's great. That last paragraph though, it just sounds like an excuse to 1) tell white people they don't have enough of a stake here to make their own decision about protesting (which isn't true, especially for the poor ones), and 2) to go back to business as usual. Kind of a bizarre request, from my point of view, especially given the circumstances.

Opinion by E.D. Mondainé
July 23, 2020 at 10:51 a.m. PDT
E.D. Mondainé is president of the Portland, Ore., branch of the NAACP.
Early in his activism, Malcolm X was asked by a young white woman what she could do to help the cause of civil rights. He famously replied, “Nothing.” Years later, he regretted dismissing her so abruptly, because he came to believe there was much she could do to advance the cause of justice for black people in the United States. But I am quite certain that striking yoga poses nude on the streets of Portland, Ore., was not on his list of actionable items.
Images of “Naked Athena,” as the protester has been labeled, have gone viral, her unclothed confrontation with police earning her accolades as a brave ally of the cause. But I see something else: a beneficiary of white privilege dancing vainly on a stage that was originally created to raise up the voices of my oppressed brothers and sisters. In this, she is not alone. As the demonstrations continue every night in Portland, many people with their own agendas are co-opting, and distracting attention from, what should be our central concern: the Black Lives Matter movement.
The protests that have gone on for weeks in Portland and around the country had a very specific origin. The killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis prompted a nationwide reckoning with the original and savage crime of slavery our country committed against African Americans. This crime has been reverberating through every generation in this country, black and white, for 401 years. That monstrous crime has finally caught up with us as a nation. I do not believe it is a time for spectacle.
Unfortunately, “spectacle” is now the best way to describe Portland’s protests. Vandalizing government buildings and hurling projectiles at law enforcement draw attention — but how do these actions stop police from killing black people? What are antifa and other leftist agitators achieving for the cause of black equality? The “Wall of Moms,” while perhaps well-intentioned, ends up redirecting attention away from the urgent issue of murdered black bodies. This might ease the consciences of white, affluent women who have previously been silent in the face of black oppression, but it’s fair to ask: Are they really furthering the cause of justice, or is this another example of white co-optation?
There is more at stake here than who appears most often on nightly TV broadcasts. Everyone seeking to advance justice in Portland faces great danger. Right now, there are unmarked, unnamed federal forces kidnapping our citizens off the streets without justification or authority. The mayor of Portland and governor of Oregon have asked them to leave, to no avail. We know this is a violation of our Constitution, but with President Trump promising only more occupations in more cities, we ignore this risk at our peril.

At their core, the Trump administration’s actions in Portland are a deception. The federal government’s response is no display of strength — rather, it is a deliberate cover for Trump’s weakness. The president and his allies want spectacle, be it a naked yogi or the next shocking display of force. They need to distract the country by engaging our movement in empty battles where they have the advantage.
If we engage them now, we do so on their terms, where they have created the conditions for a war without rules, without accountability and without the protection of our Constitution. This makes me fearful for the safety of everyone demonstrating in Portland. That’s why we need to remember: What is happening in Portland is the fuse of a great, racist backlash that the Trump administration is baiting us to light.
We cannot fall for their deception. We cannot settle for spectacles that endanger us all. This is a moment for serious action — to once again take up the mantle of the civil rights era by summoning the same conviction and determination our forebears did. We welcome our white brothers and sisters in this struggle. In fact, we need them. But I must ask them to remain humbly attuned to the opportunity of this moment — and to reflect on whether any actions they take will truly help establish justice, or whether they are simply for show.

Thursday night, I will lead a rally in downtown Portland to refocus public attention where it belongs: on redeeming a guilty nation. But recent events might be a sign that our work in the streets should be coming to an end.
I am not suggesting retreat. Instead, I am proposing that we take the cause of Black Lives Matter into those places where tear gas and rubber bullets and federal agents cannot find us, and where there is less risk of spectacle distracting from our true aims. In boardrooms, in schools, in city councils, in the halls of justice, in the smoky backrooms of a duplicitous government — that is where we will finally dismantle the gears of the brutal, racist machine that has been terrorizing black Americans and hollowing out the moral character of this nation since its inception.

I assume you are familiar with the origin of so-called identity politics? If not, it arose out of The Combahee River Collective Statement, a black lesbian feminist response to white radical lesbian separatists in the 1970's:

Johnny Dangerous said:
Although we are feminists and Lesbians, we feel solidarity with progressive Black men and do not advocate the fractionalization that white women who are separatists demand. Our situation as Black people necessitates that we have solidarity around the fact of race, which white women of course do not need to have with white men, unless it is their negative solidarity as racial oppressors. We struggle together with Black men against racism, while we also struggle with Black men about sexism.

Malcolm wrote:
And:

Johnny Dangerous said:
Above all else, Our politics initially sprang from the shared belief that Black women are inherently valuable, that our liberation is a necessity not as an adjunct to somebody else's may because of our need as human persons for autonomy. This may seem so obvious as to sound simplistic, but it is apparent that no other ostensibly progressive movement has ever consIdered our specific oppression as a priority or worked seriously for the ending of that oppression. Merely naming the pejorative stereotypes attributed to Black women (e.g. mammy, matriarch, Sapphire, whore, bulldagger), let alone cataloguing the cruel, often murderous, treatment we receive, Indicates how little value has been placed upon our lives during four centuries of bondage in the Western hemisphere. We realize that the only people who care enough about us to work consistently for our liberation are us. Our politics evolve from a healthy love for ourselves, our sisters and our community which allows us to continue our struggle and work.

This focusing upon our own oppression is embodied in the concept of identity politics. We believe that the most profound and potentially most radical politics come directly out of our own identity, as opposed to working to end somebody else's oppression. In the case of Black women this is a particularly repugnant, dangerous, threatening, and therefore revolutionary concept because it is obvious from looking at all the political movements that have preceded us that anyone is more worthy of liberation than ourselves. We reject pedestals, queenhood, and walking ten paces behind. To be recognized as human, levelly human, is enough.

We believe that sexual politics under patriarchy is as pervasive in Black women's lives as are the politics of class and race. We also often find it difficult to separate race from class from sex oppression because in our lives they are most often experienced simultaneously. We know that there is such a thing as racial-sexual oppression which is neither solely racial nor solely sexual, e.g., the history of rape of Black women by white men as a weapon of political repression.

Note, the inclusion of what has now become known as "intersectionality" in red. How anyone can dispute any of the above is quite beyond me.

Identitarianism is basically rebranded European fascism, which sees its origins in France in the French New Right (Nouvelle Droit), the granddaddy of today's alt-right, founded by Alain de Benoist and others in 1968. This movement exercises great influences on such people as Renaud Camus, author of the Great Replacement "theory," and so on in France, and in the US, people like Steve Bannon, Steven Miller, as well as the foreign policy of the Trump Administration.

I started a discussion on my Facebook timeline a while ago asking "who/which/what is the new revolutionary subject"?

Seems to me that we keep relying on outdated ideas, not having learned from the failures of "real-time" communism.

There are very few people around that will fall for that idea again and/or will  be willing to sacrifice their lives for it.

Plus modern society is quite different to early-industrial society.

And people do not really have a notion of what a collective (or collective action) is.  They understand corporations but not collectives.

Not that economic class is not a key factor.  Of course it is.  But I don't think it is enough any more.

Discrimination and oppression (and it's opposite privilege) are more individualised in our modern societies.  Mainly because post-colonial modern societies are not AS homogeneous as earlier societies.  This is not to say that earlier societies were not heterogeneous, they were, but not to the same degree.

I try to go though an old thread and I know so much about Tibetan language that I can read the Tibetan letters, I know about the "ghost"-letters, the suffixes and prefixes. Well and that brought me to a true interest in the pronunciation-transcription.

I know that the Wylie-transcription tells not much about how the word is pronounced. Which is not very practical. I have the impression that many users here stick only to the Wylie, when writing a Tibetan word. I mean, if I see something like. Bgr... in the beginning of the word, I think, it´s the Wylie.
I even think that an official pronunciation transliteration to roman letters could be helpful to preserve the Tibetan language.
I mean like grammar books written in that. That make it possible to be able to speak Tibetan but only be able to read the roman version. ( Not helpful for Buddhist scholars of course).
I had my child in Tibetan lessons, but it didn´t work out with the strain at school. And maybe some Tibetan refugee families wherever in the world they live, might have the same problem. The Tibetan script is so difficult, not because it has other letters than the roman letters, but because you must find out which letter to cross out, which is the main letter and so on...and then comes the school in the country where they live. So I think, the easy transliteration to roman letters is a really good thing.

And I  like it if a text is written like: "Wylie:.........Pronunciation:..........".really nice is, if also the Tibetan letters come but of course that would be much more work and many people might not know it or like me, do not have the technical know-how, to make them appear here. But to type the roman letters pronunciation, why not?

I live in a community where white people literally cannot have an honest conversation on race because of this years of this kind of crap. Everything is just about proving you are an "ally" that checks the boxes in activist circles.

The pattern is just to shore up your own credentials to prove you are not racist, but actually do nothing about racism. It's almost pavlovian, all the classes on diversity, equity, and whatever else, amusingly many of them given in the justice system, which is monstrously racist. So you have all the people in the justice system doing everything they can to be "inclusive", "diverse" and whatever else, but little to no effect of the material conditions that create the bulk of suffering due to systemic racism and all its legacies.

I feel like where I live much of the time "intersectional" ideas become institutionalized and act as a kind of comfort mechanism for white guilt, and very little else. If you do all the right things personally, pay attention to microagressions, be a good ally, use the right terms etc. then you can act like you've done your thing.

I guess being progressive in the USA is synonymous with speaking and believing in the language of Critical Race Theory, Intersectionality and all that nonsense.

Malcolm wrote:
You are not American, so of course you don't get it.

Archie2009 said:
Critical Race Theory was developed out of legal scholarship. It provides a critical analysis of race and racism from a legal point of view. Since its inception within legal scholarship CRT has spread to many disciplines.  CRT has basic tenets that guide its framework. These tenets are interdisciplinary and can be approached from different branches of learning.

CRT recognizes that racism is engrained in the fabric and system of the American society. The individual racist need not exist to note that institutional racism is pervasive in the dominant culture. This is the analytical lens that CRT uses in examining existing power structures. CRT identifies that these power structures are based on white privilege and white supremacy, which perpetuates the marginalization of people of color. CRT also rejects the traditions of liberalism and meritocracy. Legal discourse says that the law is neutral and colorblind, however, CRT challenges this legal “truth” by examining liberalism and meritocracy as a vehicle for self-interest, power, and privilege.  CRT also recognizes that liberalism and meritocracy are often stories heard from those with wealth, power, and privilege. These stories paint a false picture of meritocracy; everyone who works hard can attain wealth, power, and privilege while ignoring the systemic inequalities that institutional racism provides.

Intersectionality within CRT points to the multidimensionality of oppressions and recognizes that race alone cannot account for disempowerment. “Intersectionality means the examination of race, sex, class, national origin, and sexual orientation, and how their combination plays out in various settings.”[1] This is an important tenet in pointing out that CRT is critical of the many oppressions facing people of color and does not allow for a one–dimensional approach of the complexities of our world.

Hello All

Hoping I might get some luck here. I'm looking for some ongoing tutoring in classical Tibetan. So far I have completed one year of classes as SOAS in London as part of their Buddhist Studies masters programme. I was hoping to audit the second year unit but it isn't going ahead due to a lack of enrolments and the School's woeful financial situation. I have also spent a very brief time (only a week) at Shang Shung's Tibetan summer school at Merigar.

I am plodding along on my own and have worked through some of passages in a number of text books (e.g. Hodge's textbook and Hackett's reader). Sometimes I'm spot on, sometimes I'm way off and often I'm not entirely sure if I am anywhere near a correct translation or not! What I really need is some ongoing tutoring with someone who knows their stuff. My idea is a regular (weekly / fortnightly) Skype session where I can get feedback on a set translation I have attempted in the interim. I would love to make contact with someone suitable to discuss format and obviously than happy to discuss payment.

Doesn't need to be someone London or UK based (although this would be great!)

If anyone has any good leads regarding who I could approach I would be incredibly grateful - so please don't hesitate to DM me

If this sounds like some ridiculous brain teaser, it should. But unfortunately it’s not. It’s a core claim in a lawsuit we filed today challenging the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority’s (WMATA) restrictions on controversial advertising.

The ACLU, ACLU of D.C., and ACLU of Virginia are teaming up to represent a diverse group of plaintiffs whose ads were all branded as too hot for transit: the ACLU itself; Carafem, a health care network that specializes in getting women access to birth control and medication abortion; People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA); and Milo Worldwide LLC — the corporate entity of provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos.

Federal agents, including those from Trump’s Departments of Homeland Security and Justice, are terrorizing the community, threatening lives, and relentlessly attacking protesters demonstrating against police brutality.

Militarized federal agents have flouted court orders protecting the rights of protesters from local law enforcement attacks, used sharpshooters to maim people, and deployed military tools and tactics — including sonic weapons and tear gas. Black Lives Matter protesters in Portland have been shot in the head with kinetic impact munitions, swept away in unmarked cars, and repeatedly tear gassed by federal agents. These government-issued weapons are funded with our tax dollars...

That is why the ACLU of Oregon took our local police department to court, and secured a court order blocking its unconstitutional attacks on journalists and legal observers. And that’s why we’re taking the federal agents to court, too. We will not rest until law enforcement agencies — at all levels of government — are held accountable for their brutal, inhumane, and unconstitutional attacks on the people of Portland.

I see the same thing in martial arts:  People flock for seminars with brand name teachers that will show them nothing usefu,l since the students are incapable of executing even the most basic techniques (and will never apply the advanced techniques anyway), but will ignore the local teacher that will make them slog through the basics that they actually need.

A university professor is useless as a teacher if you are still at kindergarten level.

Well, that is not totally my point.

That part of my post was inspired by a recent reading of Khenpo Ngakchung's Zindri. Basically, in the section on examining potential gurus, Khenpo Ngakchung is very clear that in order to teach Vajrayana in general and Dzogchen in particular it is not actually necessary to be an awakened person.

But, I do think I agree with your post.

A convention is something, which, left unanalyzed, seems to stand on its own. For example, "I am going to town."

I refer you to Nāgārjuna's analysis of movement, from which this example is drawn.

Malcolm wrote:
So that means there are phenomena existing independently of us.

Now, the basic proposition:

“As we realize with the utmost effort that all times (jinji) are all existence (jin’u), absolutely no additional dharma remains."

"All times" must refer to the past, present, and future.  All existence is included in these three times. As I pointed outed once one before I fail to see, facially, how this assertion is any better than the Hinayāna Sarvastivāda school's assertion that all phenomena exist in the three times.

Since Nāgārjuna effectively refutes time as a being anything more than a convention, and effectively refutes cause and condition as being anything more than a convention, I fail to see how your phenomena existing independently of one's projections is also anything more than a convention, which cannot be established in any way at all. Further, with respect to Dogen's assertion, if being = time, and time = being, the failure to establish one is the also the failure to establish the other since they are held to be mutually dependent.

In other words, rather than there being an eternal now, as someone suggested in this thread, in fact, no dharma ever arose anywhere at any time. The meaning of dependent origination is just nonorigination. I am certain Dogen addresses this point somewhere in his writing, and realizes this point, because everyone one understands Dogen to be a sublimely realized master.

And most Buddhists in America are Asian immigrants. A shame Tibetans chose to settle in India. It didn't work out well. I wish they had chosen a Western country and then flooded it.

PeterC said:
Even if the Tibetan lamas had all stayed in Tibet, the monastic model would still have had to change, because the economics of the society that once supported it have changed out of all recognition.  Similarly the society that created and supported distributed Dharma centers has changed so radically that we need to rethink exactly what sort of a structure we need - and indeed, what are the outcomes we're even trying to achieve in terms of training lamas, organizing teachings, etc. A lot of sanghas still think raise money + build center = success.  However the opposite is probably true: these centers then become a financial burden on the organization and the lamas' teaching schedules get hijacked to do quasi-fundraising in the form of teaching tours, and other activities (e.g. funding translations) get starved of cash as a result.

Is there a continuously changing courses of events in biology on which we ( due to the human inability to observe such slow change occurring in real time) impute fixed notions of “ seed”, “sapling”  and “tree” the Yes. Of course.

So you mean labels are projections but processes are real?

PadmaVonSamba said:
“real” usually means, “just as valid as the experience I have of myself and my perceptions”.

Labels and projections and processes, all are dependently arising, composite, constantly changing phenomena, but are experienced as inherently existing entities to which we impute the quality of “real” or “reality”.
It is certainly valid to do so, in terms of Samsaric existence. Otherwise we would not know if the bridge over a river was “real” of not.
Ultimately, however, “real” and “not real” doesn’t mean anything. In our “reality” the universe is real. The material world is real. Ultimately, it is neither real nor unreal. Those are simply relative concepts, a comparative duality.

Second: If somebody  practices "only" sutra mahamudra, what exactly is the minimum of other practises to practice from the Varjayana teachings? I cannot imagine it can be practised without at least a short formal guru yoga.
The two accumulations in the kagyu mahamudra curriculum are gathered in the uncommon preliminaries, which themselves are vajrayana - they are all guru yoga of different forms. This is what Thrangu R, in the passage Astus quotes, says that practitioners of "sutra" mahamudra need to be doing. All roads lead to Rome.

Correct. Among the uncommon or "unshared" preliminaries, the source of mandala offerings and guru yoga is the Guhyasamāja Tantra. These practices do not exist in lower tantras, much less sūtra.

Some would argue that Sapan was the most important master of mahāmudra in Tibet. He was after all an eighth stage bodhisattva. Just saying. It all depends on one's perspective and what one chooses to accept and reject. After all, oneself is the ultimate authority in all matters of religion, and no one else.

With respect, your view on this is very, very settled in favour of Sapan. I am not saying that this is unfounded, only that there are other sound positions and because you do not grant this there is little point engaging in a debate.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, there is the fact that no sutra mentions this word, “mahamudra.” The position Astus produced  is based on cherry picked citations that do not take into consideration the whole text being cited.

I even pointed out that Sakyapas do exactly the same thing Kagyus do, that is, teach shamatha and vipashyana bolstered with mahamudra citations from Saraha, Virupa, and so on, the primary difference being that Sakyapas are a) unwilling to term this sutra mahamudra and b) unwilling to admit there are other forms of entry into Vajrayana than a major empowerment. As for b) I don’t hold the Sakya position. I never have, even though I have argued from that position as a formality. You should not assume I believe every position I defend. I’ve even defended Tsongkhapa’s presentation of the two truths for fun. It is called sharpening prajna.

So again, one could critique this in many ways, but it is a huge misrepresentation of the terrain to hold that anyone who argues against "mahamudra implies tantric empowerment" is an anomaly.  It is simply isn't.

Malcolm wrote:
There is certainly no Indian precedent for the idea that there can be mahāmudra in absence of some kind of empowerment. None whatsoever. This is just a fact. There is nothing to argue about here.

But again, "authority" is up to you, not some book that says this or that. If people want to believe the realization of mahāmudra does not depend on a guru and empowerment, they are perfectly free to hold that belief. But it certainly isn't born out by an examination of his collected works that Gampopa actually believed this himself. In fact, in Gampopa's works one even finds criticisms of mahāmudra and dzogchen in favor of tattva, reality/truth. I am afraid that until his whole collected works are translated, it will be difficult for people to really understand completely what his point of view was.

Trying to introduce the nature of the mind without first having an experience of the nature of the mind is like trying to introduce someone to someone when that person is not present: you can say, "Mr. X" is tall/short, has big/short nose, is fat/thin, Arabic/Asian/Jewish/Black/White, etc., but if you don't see this person first, no matter what description you are given, you will not recognize this person.

Something else to consider is that Buddhism in the west has inflated statistics on terms of how many white people are actually seriously participating. For instance, there is a movement of what is called "Tantra" amongst a fair amount of "spiritual" gay men in the village party scene of Montreal. This "Tantra" movement is actually just a group of men who have group sex with each other. There is no actually Tantra practiced in it, but participants will say they practice Tantric Buddhism. It's tantric "Buddhism," not Hinduism, specifically because the leader of the group has pretensions to being a Buddhist.

So there's at least ~500 false positives in Montreal. The amount only goes up when we take closer looks in other places.

Neither the mind of the past, nor that of the future, nor that of the present, is perceived. When ·the mind is born, it comes from nowhere, and when it ceases it goes nowhere because it is inapprehensible, undemonstrable, and non-physical. If you ask, "What is the entity of that which is inapprehensible, undemonstrable; and non-physical?" the Heap of jewels states: "O Kashyapa, when the mind is thoroughly sought, it cannot be found. What is not found Cannot be perceived. And what is not perceived is neither past nor future nor present." Through such analysis, the beginning of the mind is ultimately not seen, the end of the mind is ultimately not seen, and the middle of the mind is ultimately not seen.'
(Stages of Meditation, p 131-132)

'If you wish to recognize clearly the non-dwelling mind, then during your meditation just be aware that your mind does not think about any object or hold on to any dualities, such as good and evil, etc. Since past things are already past, you should not think about them anymore; and, thus, any thought about the past vanishes. This is known as being without the past. Furthermore, since future things have not yet arrived, you should neither seek nor wish for them; and, thus, any thought of the future vanishes. This is known as being without the future. Finally, since present things are already present, you should not grasp them nor allow a thought of love or hate to arise; and, thus, any thought about the present vanishes. This is known as being without the present. In summary, if no thought about these three time periods arises, then the three time periods do not exist. If a thought of moving arises, do not follow it; and the thought of moving will vanish. If a thought of dwelling arises, do not follow it; and the thought of dwelling will vanish.'

Though the Bodhicittavivarana is actually commentarial text on the Akṣobhyavajra section of the Guhysamāja tantra, and is thus, a tantric commentary, not a sūtric commentary. It also is unlikely to be composed by Nāgārjuna I, though that hardly matters.

At the Cham Shan temple in Toronto, at least one of the venerables there teaches the Dharma with six elements -- earth, water, fire, air, space, mind. This seems to be a minority practice, as most Buddhisms have the "Five Elements" -- earth, water, fire, air, space. Śrāvaka Buddhism is usually associated with the Four Elements -- earth, water, fire, air.

Of all unlikely places, I found a list of the six elements in śrāvaka scripture, both Theravādin Pāli and Sarvāstivādin Chinese parallels: Chayimā, bhikkhu, dhātuyo: 1. Pathavīdhātu, 2. āpodhātu, 3. tejodhātu, 4. vāyodhātu, 5. ākāsadhātu, 6. viññāṇadhātu.
There are, monastic, these six elements: 1. The earth element, 2. the water element, 3. the fire element, 4. the wind element, 5. the space element, and 6. the consciousness element.

Malcolm wrote:
Honestly, you cannot reason this through in the way you are attempting to do. In all seriousness, you are completely entangled in a  briar patch  of views.

The so-called word empowerment is based on a specific experience. So are Mahamudra pointing-out instructions. I have received one on one Mahamudra pointing out instructions in the Karma Kagyu tradition from Ayang Rinpoche, a direct disciple of the 16th Karmapa. So I understand how this works very well through my own experience. You will not understand this unless you to do the necessary work, find a guru, do what is necessary to please them, and make oneself a suitable candidate for such instructions. It is really that simple.

All the authors of all the Mahamudra books you are fond of quoting all assume that one has the required experience necessary for Mahamudra pointing out.

Further conversation about this is rather pointless. You are like a man who, having never tasted sugar, insists on arguing with those who have what “sweet” tastes like based on descriptions of “sweet” in a number of books.

Also in Sakya, in the Three Visions teachings of Lamdre, they do not use the term "mahāmudra" per se, but they do combine dohas with teachings on śamatha and vipaśyanā. For Nyingmapas, mahāmudra is either an alternate name for the state of Dzogchen, like Prajñapāramitā, or more commonly, refers to realizing the nature of the mind in the form of a yidam, and refers to the third of the four vidyādhara stages.

Malcolm wrote:
There are, within, Vajrayāna, two methods of giving rise to nondual gnosis: the first is the practice of the two stages; the second is guru yoga. Not that it really matters, but Sakya Pandita also endorses these two means.

Vipaśyanā, in Vajrayāna is not a result of intellectual analysis, it is rather a product of integrating the experience of the example gnosis or the genuine gnosis induced during empowerment, depending on the practitioner. For example, Naropa likens the experience of the example gnosis to the first bhumi, and while this experience is not necessarily the first bhumi, it can be a genuine gnosis in some persons of higher capacity. When it comes to "direct introduction" or so-called pointing out, the principle is roughly the same.

The difference between the two stages and guru yoga is that one is using the power of devotion ( mos gus gyi rtsal ) to recapitulate the experience of the introduction, where as the former uses the more gradual process of working with this experience in the context of the two stages.

For the latter, having recognized what was introduced, the nature of the mind, one rests in that state.

These two methods, thw two stages and guru yoga, are more effective for giving rise to vipaśyanā because there is no intellectual analysis involved. It is based on a direct perception, no matter how fleeting, not inferred through reasoning and analysis.

Virtually all schools use a combination of guru yoga and the two stages combined into a single practice, for example Five-fold Mahāmudra of Drikung, Naro Khacho of Sakya, and so on. Sort of hedging bets.

Guru yoga in all Tibetan Buddhist schools is regarded as the supreme path to awakening, bar none. Because Kagyu Mahāmudra and Dzogchen are both paths of self-liberation (grol lam), rather than paths of transformation (sgyur lam), guru yoga is the principle path, especially in Dzogchen teachings. The principle difference between Kagyu Mahāmudra and Dzogchen, as Ringu Tulku personally confirmed for me, is that the former lacks tögal. But in the Karma Kagyu and Drukpa Kagyu school, it is quite common for practitioners to spend a long time practicing Mahāmudra, and then eventually embark on practicing tögal, Khenpo Tsultrim Gyatso, Thrangu RInpoche, etc., are all examples of masters who teach students using this progression. As I understand things in Drikung, having long association with Nangchen Drikungpas such as Gyalpo Rinpoche and Ontul Rinpoche, who are both important gurus of mine who specialize in Yangzab, people other than lineage heads usually choose one track or other other.

Ted Biringer said:
Seems a bit quiet in here - let's see if anyone wants to talk about Existence-Time (uji)

In Zen time and existence are not two different things; time is always existence-and-time, existence is always existence-and-time. This view is most clearly and comprehensively demonstrated in Shobogenzo’s development and use of the term ‘uji.’ Dogen fashioned this term by combining two terms; ‘u’ (existence) and ‘ji’ (time) into the single term ‘uji’ (existence-time, or time-being). The point that seems most significant here is that existence and time are never separate from each other; each is an essential element of the other – no dharmas exist independent of time, and there is no time independent of dharmas. This notion of existence-time is central to Zen’s vision of reality, thus is presupposed in all Zen expressions.

Hee-Jin Kim brings the crucial significance of this notion to light in a comment from his discussion of the aptly titled ‘Uji’ fascicle of Shobogenzo:

Dogen’s whole thesis in this regard was crystallized in the following: “As we realize with the utmost effort that all times (jinji) are all existence (jin’u), absolutely no additional dharma remains.” In other words, existence-time subsumed space and time totally and exhaustively.
Hee-Jin Kim, Eihei Dogen: Mystical Realist, p.150

In short, each and every particular thing, being, and event (i.e. dharma) is an intrinsic and essential element of total time, and each and every moment or duration of time is an intrinsic and essential element of total existence – hence each and every particular dharma is a manifestation of the whole universe, and the whole universe is manifest in and as each and every particular dharma. In Dogen’s words:

Let us pause to reflect whether or not any of the whole of existence or any of the whole universe has leaked away from the present moment of time.
Shobogenzo, Uji (Trans. Gudo Nishijima & Mike Cross)

Accordingly, in Zen expressions the terms ‘existence,’ ‘time,’ and ‘existence-time’ are synonymous.

Peace,
Ted

In addition to this, Dzogchen was that old stuff from the imperial period, so it fell out of favor. Both the Kagyus and the Sakyapas had narratives developed around abandoning that Old Time Religion; the former grounded in the narrative of Milarepa being too much of a dunce to understand the teachings of Dzogchen he received from one Rongton; the latter grounded in the narrative of Khon Konchog Gyalpo and his older brother seeing secret Nyingma cham performed in public at a harvest festival. In addition to this was the hostility towards the older translation school tantras mentioned above, which is enthusiastically adopted and promulgated by orthopraxy-obsessed Dromton (who interfered with Atish's wish to focus on teaching Dohas, and termed a māra by Milarepa in one of his songs), etc.

So, from the time of Gampopa, all the way up through 18th century, it was de rigueur for everyone to criticize Dzogchen, notable Kagyupas such as the 8th Karmapa included.

Thankfully, Nyingma tertons and yogis paid such FUD little mind and just kept on promulgating Dzogchen teachings.

You won’t find any statement of gampopa himself saying you don’t need any sort of empowerment, whether elaborate or unelaborate.  You present a few quotations that might suggest this, but they run counter to the experience of the vast majority of living and dead kagyu masters.

Astus said:
Why not look for where Gampopa states one needs any sort of empowerment for Mahamudra? The quotations so far clearly differentiated the "tantra" from the "sutra" version, and for the tantric it's unambiguous about the need for empowerment. At the same time, Kagyupas have been under attack since the time of Sakya Pandita that they teach Mahamudra outside the standard HYT system, and various teachers defended their position regarding the validity of Gampopa's Mahamudra. Were they all arguing about nothing?

Malcolm wrote:
You do not understand the parameters of the debate. Sapan says that so-called "sūtra mahāmudra" is just prajñāpāramitā, and as such, is not a swift path to awakening in a single lifetime. He is not arguing that the gnosis which arises from mahāmudra and prajñāpāramitā are qualitatively different. He even argues that to maintain there is a difference in view between sūtra and secret mantra is a qualitative error.

Astus said:
If "unelaborate empowerment" is the pointing out instruction, that is, the very method that Mahamudra is taught, then likely those who debate the absence of empowerment mean the complete four empowerments and they do not accept the possibility that direct introduction equals the fourth empowerment and is sufficient on its own.

Malcolm wrote:
If you examine Kongtrul's encyclopedia, he clearly states, echoing Jñānakīrti, that "sutra mahāmudra" was taught to inferior disciples who were not suitable for receiving actual Mahāmudra teachings. Why? Because they do not receive empowerment of any kind and are not proper recipients. So they receive instructions on śamatha and vipaśyanā, and inspiring dohas to reflect on.

Of course, this is not how the mahāmudra is actually taught in any Kagyu school, so you are just dancing on books you don't understand completely in a tradition that is not your own. A little knowledge as proven to be a dangerous thing in your case, Ācārya Astus. You should stay in your Chan lane.

As for your other point, it is true that Sakya Pandita and others do not accept a so-called "direct introduction" as a sufficient entry into Vajrayāna, but I am not defending Sapan on this point, since I myself do not agree with this perspective.

Nevertheless, those who do accept this principle still understand that "direct introduction," "pointing out," etc., "the empowerment of the potential of vidyā (rig pa'i rtsal dbang)," etc. are empowerments in every sense of the term and defend them on those terms, and consider these empowerments indispensable for entering the path. However, they maintain that these empowerments are reserved for those pupils of highest capacity, hence they are not suitable for everyone. Thus, essence mahāmudra, etc., are traditionally only given to people on the basis of having studied and practiced regular Vajrayāna teachings for many years.

*Most of Sapan's other criticisms, for example, of the karpo cigthub, are directed at Lama Shang, not Gampopa proper.

No one cares about your gut, come with data and a rational argument. Obviously, the science on Covid 19 changes daily, expecting anything else would be silly, or just tremendously ignorant. Public policy is imperfect and yes, plenty of times it's not evidence-based. A lot of the "science journalism" is also terrible.

That's partially because there simply isn't much evidence yet, partially because they are forced to make decisions based on limited information and what is possible (rather than what is desirable), and partially because yes, sometimes public officials make stupid decisions even in the best of times, much less times like these.

Honestly, if you want to rant about Covid 19, you should look at a federal government that is refusing to provide the needed relief and infrastructure during shutdowns, instead of wringing your hands about the shutdowns themselves. A big part of why they are so devastating is because Trump and his cronies do stuff like this:

https://news.yahoo.com/ivanka-trump-tel ... 56343.html

And focus on corporate welfare and protecting companies from lawsuits instead of actually providing substantial, long term relief from people effected by the economic effects of the shutdown. It wouldn't be hard, the military budget is still insane.

Rambling on about your "gut" when you don't seem to even know the basics of where the science is at is just silly though.

On the article, I don't know, but since the virus is spread through droplets and possibly aerosol, I suppose being in an enclosed space one's choices are pretty limited.

From my perspective, Kagyupas don't teach "Sutra Mahamudra."

Kagyu lamas teach Mahamudra.  In our day and age, what this means varies by teacher, but I feel confident in saying that Kagyu Lamas teach a variety of methods, from Sutra and Tantra, and use the term "Mahamudra" to denote relating to "nature of mind."   I see "Sutra Mahamudra" as merely the name of a didactic method.  Citations are used, and focus on "Sutra" is stressed, but I've not met any Kagyu Lama who teaches such things in a vacuum, apart from the path of the two stages,even in a simplified form.  The Pointing Out Instructions of the various Kagyu traditions are really equivalent to the Fourth Empowerment, or so it is said.  It may be true that Gampopa was influenced by his "Nyingma past," whatever that means, but it is stressed in our Kagyu traditions that the Dohas and other pith instructions are the inheritance of the Kagyu lineage.  And while it's true that Mahamudra can be taught as a certain application during the path of the two stages, it is also a way of practice incorporating "sutra" methods--Samatha and Vipassana--but with unique instructions and a unique object of focus.

Honestly, though, all Tibetan Lamas of whatever institutional affiliation are Vajrayana practitioners.  So in answer to the original question, I think it's better to see Mahamudra as a Vajrayana corpus of methods, sometimes relating to Sutra, sometimes relating more to "Tantra," but always found in Vajrayana and therefore at the level of Tantra.

For the life of me, I personally do not understand those who must adhere to some sort of notional "Pure Sutra Mahamudra" nor do I find much more than polemics in those who choose to argue vehemently against the "very existence" of a Sutra Mahamudra.

Not only that; the term Mahāmudrā is used for emptiness. The King of Concentration Sutra says, “The intrinsic nature of all dharmas is Mahāmudrā.”

Malcolm wrote:
The Samādhirāja Sūtra says nothing of the sort.

The term "mahāmudra" is not exist in that sūtra or any other. This is just a fact. Therefore, you must stop using this citation. The scholar who originally claimed this citation as a support for mahāmudra was merely interpolating his bias into the text in order to deceive his hapless disciples.
The passage you are citing is this one:

།འདི་ལས་སངས་རྒྱས། ཡེ་ཤེས་མཆོག་ཀྱང་འབྱུང༌། །ཆོས་རྣམས་ཀུན་གྱི་རང་བཞིན་ཕྱག་རྒྱ་སྟེ། །ཏིང་འཛིན་འདི་ནི་འདྲེན་བདག་གིས་བཤད།

“It originates from the supreme wisdom of buddhahood.
It is the seal of the nature of all phenomena.
This is the samādhi taught by the guides."

17.144, Roberts, 84,000 edition.

Therefore, we can understand the term "mahāmudra" exists exclusively the tantras. Even there is has different meanings.

Indeed the Tattvāvatārākhyasakalasugatavacastātparyavyākhyāprakaraṇa says "Another name of the Bhagavāti Prajñāpāramita is mahāmudra, because it has the inherent nature of nondual gnosis."

But this has been poorly understood. Here, the Bhagavāti Prajñāpāramita is part of the maṇḍala of Guhyasamāja, etc., as the text describes in detail.

Further, far from being a treatise which equivocates sutrayāna or provides a basis for claiming that sutrayāna also has mahāmudra, it is quite the opposite. It is a text which explicates secret mantra for those of the best capacity. It says, "Because other yogis lack good fortune (skal med), gnosis is taught as mahāmudra in order to introduce them."

Is Jamgon Kongtrul wrong then?

'Dakpo Rinpoché induced the realization of mahamudra even in beginners who had not received empowerment. Therefore this is the tradition of the perfections. These are instructions arising primarily from the Kadampa tradition.'
(Treasury of Knowledge, vol 9, p 212)

And Dzogchen Ponlop Rinpoche?

'The Sutrayana approach to Mahamudra is seen as a very profound method because it does not require any of the sophisticated and complex tantric rituals, deity yoga visualization practices, or samayas. It is a simple sutra approach, yet it conveys the direct transmission of the tantric essence of awakening. This particular approach is also known as a secret passage. 
...
The Sutra Mahamudra approach is seen as a specialty of the Kagyu tradition and was the central emphasis of Gampopa's teachings. Therefore, although it originated in India and was also taught by Marpa and Milarepa, Gampopa is regarded as the main figure responsible for bringing this teaching to its full development and manifestation.'
(Wild Awakening, p 32, 33)
There are Kagyupas who say things like that, and there are Kagyupas who would not.  Of those who would say that, some would qualify it by saying that the pointing out instruction, which is central to the practice of Kagyu Mahamudra, could also be interpreted as a form of the fourth empowerment. Those who would not say that typically give an empowerment whenever they do a teaching on Mahamudra.
Jamgon Kongtrul also notes (ToK, v9, p 213): 'It has been the practice of most of Dakpo’s heart disciples to present the mahamudra instructions after having first bestowed the empowerment.'

The same practice of mixing is also noted by Tashi Namgyal:
'In the present age, Mahamudra and Mantrayana [tantric mysticism] are being blended and meditated upon in order to enhance realization. Many tantric elements are also incorporated into the preparatory practices. For those who wish to practice these, the empowerment for actualizing the inner potentiality is certainly essential.'
(Mahamudra the Moonlight, p 125)
So it's a distinction without a difference.
It's a distinction made by Thrangu Rinpoche.

Gampopa only became a Kadampa monk in his middle years, after the death of his wife. Before this, he was a Nyingma practitioner, this well known.

For example, your ludicrous assertion that Gampopa eschews empowerment rites. He doesn’t. In order to have a guru, one needs to receive some form of abhisheka. Otherwise, all the empowerment’s Gampopa received and gave would have been absolutely pointless. He never claims they were pointless. Very little written by Gampopa has been translated. You are presenting a very partial view of his thought. Most scholars have focused on polemics between early Sakya masters and early Kagyu masters, to the extent that a more robust view of what Gampopa actually taught, rather than a narrow and defensive presentation of his Mahamudra (about which there is considerable disagreement even among Kagyus) is sorely absent from modern discussions.

This is true. There is this thing going on a lot in modern vajrayana. Folks just get empowerments. But what is meant to happen is an empowerment, full transmissions of all the sadhanas and full instructions on the practices. That way a person knows what they are doing and when to do it.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, what you say quite correct. People never sit down and learn one HYT sadhana practice from soup to nuts. Once they do this, all other sadhanas are cake. They never bother to pay attention to how to integrate their 24 hour a day activity into their practice. And so they remain confused and dissatisfied, and rather than understanding why they are interested in this system and that system, they wander around like hungry ghosts in search of food and water they never find.

That does not seem to agree with the teachings.

'Take food as medicine, in the right amount,
Without attachment, without hatefulness:
Don’t eat for vanity, for pride or ego’s sake,
Eat only for your body’s sustenance.'
(Letter to a Friend by Nagarjuna, v 38, tr Padmakara Translation Group)

'Buddhas told those with desire
That food, clothes and dwellings are all
To be avoided and to remain
Close to their spiritual guides.'
(Four Hundred Stanzas by Aryadeva, v 138, tr Ruth Sonam)

'Most sentient beings are greedy for tastes; for the sake of food, they commit vile actions and are born in the hells. But those who {know the Dharma} are contented, not greedy, free from longing; they do not bow down to the sense of taste, but are contented and can be nourished even with very low-quality food.'
(Multitude of Jewels Sutra (Ratnarāśisūtra) quoted in The Training Anthology of Santideva, p 127, tr Charles Goodman)

See also: The concept of revulsion toward food

Malcolm wrote:
These above teachings are consistent with the path of renunciation. However, they are contradicted by the higher teachings of Vajrayāna, the path of transfomation, and the citations illustrating this point have already been provided above, so there is no need to repeat them here.

As also mentioned above, the Buddha's teachings of sūtra are for those with a) less affliction, and b) less capability. But contrast, Vajrayāna teachings are designed for those with a) greater affliction, and b) greater capabilities.

Therefore, can either accept the Buddha's teachings in the tantras, in which case, one has no choice but to become a Vajrayāna practitioner; but failing that, if one cannot generate faith in these teachings, then leave them aside, but do not criticize them, because there in lies the fault of criticizing the Dharma.

In sūtra there is no antidotal method of conceiving the appearance of things as pure which are typically conceived by ordinary sentient being as impure. Emptiness, in sutra, is provided as cure for this, in terms of nature, but not in terms of appearance. Vajrayāna address both nature and appearance; sūtra only addresses nature, not appearance.

Astus said:
One sees a tasty looking apple pie. How not to fall into craving? For instance, the Vitakkasanthana Sutta gives five (progressive) methods: pay attention to something else (that is conducive to good thoughts), consider the drawbacks of craving, forget and pay no attention to it, relax the mental fabrications/concoctions about it, subdue the thoughts by force. Or one can think of it as something disgusting, something undesirable; or as something insubstantial, meaningless, and worthless. How would Vajrayana address this situation? If one thinks one is a buddha one can just give in to any impulse?

Malcolm wrote:
As I said, these are all based on renunciation of sense objects since one has ordinary concepts concerning them.

With respect to "giving into impulses" Vajrayāna there is eating yoga, sleeping yoga, bathing yoga, yoga for engaging in sexual intercourse is one is a lay person, etc., everything to transform ordinary daily conduct and bring it into the path by replacing impure conceptuality with pure conceptuality.

When one is on an island composed entirely of gold, one will have attachment to no specific part of it, one will have no discrimination towards anything on it, and thereby, one is freed of clinging.

Astus said:
The distinction between the the common and uncommon Mahāyāna is principally the difference between method, the latter being more efficacious and more rapid. One does not merely regard oneself as buddhanatured, causally, one regards oneself as a buddha from the outset of entering the path. One does not regard one's teacher as being "like a buddha," one regards one's master as an actual buddha right from the outset and so on, based on the special methods of abhiṣeka, sadhana, and so forth.
How does it make it more efficacious to think of oneself being a buddha, instead of not to think of oneself as anything at all?

Malcolm wrote:
We already think of ourselves, this is a given. In other words, in just the same way as fire is used to put out fire, or water is used to draw water out of the ear, the creation stage uses conceptuality to overcome conceptuality. Hence it is more profound than methods which try to suppress or eliminate conceptuality, such as those you mention above.

In your provided quote, it says, “all phenomena bear the mark of Emptiness”

The heart sutra that I am familiar with states: sarva-dharmah sunyata-alaksana. It means all dharmas are emptiness, without characteristic, etc. It does not say: Sarva-dharma sunyataa-laksana (i.e. all phenomena bear the mark of Emptiness). For this reason I said inconsistency.

What does it mean to be Pure? Without defilements, impurities, contaminants, etc.

When we say something is empty, we mean it is compounded - ie. it is empty of intrinsic value; it is an incident (which include our psychological involvement with the proposed entity) that we falsely ascribe an entity to. But there are no entities from the beginning - just our ascribing of distinctions. The elements composing this incident are themselves empty. Anything we can say about any thing, or its constituents, is a discernment in our mind; ie. projections. There is nothing we can say about objects projected upon - because they don't exist. They are themselves functions of the distinction of self and object...

This analysis goes on and on until one is ready to give up. This analysis always defeats any notion we have.

There is nothing to say beyond our conjecture. We can, however, intuit that its not nothing... we call it pure because what else is there to say about it? It sheds any projections we put on it with bewildering ease... and yet its not nothing... it has no features... yet not nothing...

What is that?

That's what sitting on the cushion is for.

Secret Mantra is superior because the wisdom which arises in the mind at the time of the descent of gnosis, or third empowerment and so forth, is freedom from proliferation realized directly.
That is an answer then to have wisdom available from the start, although the third empowerment is said to be only an example, and the fourth is the actual realisation that is the level of Dzogchen (Treasury of Precious Qualities, vol 2, p 130-132) and Mahamudra (e.g.The Treasury of Knowledge, vol 6, p 231-233; further elaborated in Mahamudra and Related Instructions, p 485-490).

Malcolm wrote:
It is not certain that the gnosis of the descent of the gnosis being or the gnosis demonstrated during the experience of third and fourth empowerment is only an example wisdom. That depends very much on the trainee. But there is no method of inducing either an example gnosis or a realized gnosis in any sūtra tradition as the entrance to the path. Why? In sūtra, abhiṣeka is reserved for tenth stage bodhisattvas in the second half the tenth bhumi, as indicated by the Avatamsaka, Lankāvatāra, and other sūtras.

Astus said:

Here's a longish piece about how Melbourne, our second-largest city at about 5 million people, got hit with a second wave of cases.
The take-home message is that "suppression" (keeping case numbers low) is always going to be likely to fail, meaning that "elimination" plus hard border controls looks increasingly likely to be the only path back to some kind of normality.

Still, as an exercise in showing how weak the received assumptions on Bon/Buddhist relationships are (the "authoritative" account that has been repeatedly relied on by Tibetan scholars is a tissue of falsehoods), the work is worth reading if you have a lot of time and take it with a shakerfull of salt.

I was actually going to ask this on this site later on, but now this thread started I will ask now, because I think it is relevant to if there is a forum about monastic life.

I grew up having heard that lay people shouldn't study vinaya.
But now that I'm an adult I discover that so much commonly known information comes from the vinaya. And one lay teacher of mine said it's fine for lay people to study the vinaya and that there is no rule against it.

So mys questions,
Is there really a rule, like a written rule, about lay people studying vinaya?

Bristollad said:
All three geshes I've received Vinaya teachings from have said that such is the rule.  During sojong (the fortnightly repairing of vows), even the novices aren't allowed to attend or listen to the fully ordained section.  One of the geshes though did allow novices who were soon to take full ordination to read the vows of the fully ordained in preparation.  However, the study and discussion of them still had to wait until after full ordination.  There seems to be a lot more of the Theravadin material available in translation than from the Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya (followed by the Tibetan traditions).  I don't know about the Dharmagupta Vinaya material.  There are two books from the Dalai Lama on the vows of the novice, and on the vows of the fully-ordained.  In the front of the novices' book, it says it is restricted to those who have received novice ordination.  The other book for fully-ordained has a similar notice restricting it to those who are fully ordained.

Malcolm wrote:
Just a strategy to keep upasakas, etc., ignorant. It’s bullshit. Vinaya was compiled long after after the Buddha’s passing, This is why there are so many different ones, with different rules, rites, and so on, and most of the vinaya rules were instituted by the Buddha because lay people complained about this or that bhiksu’s behavior. Thus Vinaya should be studied by Upasakas to keep the Shramaneras honest.

The relation between the tribes and the US Federal government is interesting. The tribes have some sort of weird semi-sovereignty within the United States. I recall reading that one of the Iroquois nations - maybe Mohawks? - had declared war on Germany and Japan at the outset of WWII so that they could maintain a claim to sovereignty while also letting tribe members serve in the US Military. This sovereignty has in recent decades been used to open casinos and sell cigarettes and gas, tax free, but its encouraging to see the tribes getting a little more of their sovereignty back.

I haven't read the details of these decisions, but going on your descriptions - I can't understand how a state's rights argument applies to the tribes.

Anyways... I hope Trump dies in prison. It will be interesting to see which Russian gangsters have been his backstops and lenders over the years.

PeterC said:
The federal courts' jurisprudence on tribes is, frankly, a mess, and SCOTUS was the worst offender in that respect. There is apparently a joke amongst lawyers working in tribal law that the *real* canon of tribal law is: the Indians always lose in the end.

Basically the senior judges in the federal appellate courts and the supreme court understand the interplay of state and federal law but simply do not understand where tribes fit in. Since most of the cases involve a conflict between state law and tribal law, they generally give the decision to the states. It's been a constant source of frustration for tribes over the decades.

Astus said:
I don't think any path promotes accepting or rejecting as the way to go. Rather, to be free of grasping, one needs to see things as they actually are.

Malcolm wrote:
This is consistent with the path of renunciation, including Khenchen's comment.

But in Vajrayāna, we do not give up the basis, that is, the five objects of desire. Loppön Sonam Tsemo states in his General Presentation of the Divisions of Tantra:

Astus said:
First, the basis, as explained before, is the five desire objects. Those are the basis itself, but if it is the objects themselves, how are they to be given up? Since most people are totally fettered, how are [they] able to give up [the basis]?

[The basis] is not to be given up. The Vajrapañjara Tantra states:

Created by passion, the worldly
shall be liberated by the same passion.

And the Śrī Guhyasamāja:

The passionate desiring wisdom
always rely on the five desire objects.

Now then, if one asks “Won’t there be bondage because of objects?” Those without a method will be bound, i.e., like common beings. If one possesses a method, liberation is assisted by those [objects] themselves. For example, like poison, or like fire. Therefore, objects do not intrinsically create bondage. Bondage is created by the deceived concepts that depend on those [objects].

For that reason, since one is liberated because of having given up the intrinsic cause of bondage [i.e. deceived concepts,] the objects which [earlier] became the condition of that [bondage] [now] become the condition of liberation.

As such, the Śrī Hevajra-tantra states:

The savage actions of people
bring bondage by this and that;
If one possesses the method, by just those [actions]
one shall be liberated from the bondage of becoming.


Malcolm wrote:
How does this in fact work? Again with respect to the creation stage:

Astus said:
The first is having understood the object and subject of who and what appears as oneself as the sole deity, sensual pleasures are mentioned in the Śrī
Guhyasamāja:

All the desired pleasures
are what one serves with desire;
make offerings to oneself and others
with the yoga of oneself as the deity.

It is also mentioned in the same way elsewhere. That reduces and then dispels the ordinary concepts of those interested [in desire objects]...Since that is so, the cause of bondage is concepts of the ordinary. If that is a consciousness of a deity, since the ordinary ceases, everything will be given up respectively.


Malcolm wrote:
With respect to the completion stage:

Astus said:
Second, skill in means of the completion stage is the arising of nonconceptual samadhi dependent on any suitable method, and because of that, the objects change their aspect, and can be enjoyed.

As such, the Continuation of the Guhyasamāja Tantra states:

The form of aggregates, elements and gateway
arising from method and wisdom
are definitely applied in mantra
with the yoga of the completion stage.

In that way, the cause of bondage is conceptuality. Since non-conceptual samadhi removes conceptuality, all bonds will be respectively released.


Malcolm wrote:
Finally, with respect to how liberation actually occurs in Vajrayāna:

Astus said:
Third, the way one is liberated from that [bondage]: as before, in general the cause of bondage is just conceptuality, and in particular, concepts of the ordinary because the afflictions, etc., arise respectively depending upon that. That being so, if the intrinsic nature of that cause is dispelled by the two methods [above], since the aspect of the objects has changed, again one can depend on objects since they have been transformed into assisting antidotes. As such, The Hevajra Tantra states:

Since the poison has been eliminated by purification,
these objects to be relied upon are reliable.


Malcolm wrote:
The problem of liberation is not to be quickly resolved by renunciation of the five objects of desire, rather, it is to be quickly resolved by relinquishing the ordinary conceptuality about the five objects of desire that is the root of all attachment and aversion. Sonam Tsemo argues:

Astus said:
Also it is said that the Pāramitāyāna is intended for those of dull faculties who wish awakening: in general, those of little affliction, and in particular, for those who are able to give up the tormenting attachment to desire.

Also Secret Mantra was taught intending those of sharp faculties who wished unsurpassed awakening: in general, for some people whose afflictions are strong, and in particular, who cannot give up the tormenting attachment to desire.

As such, if Secret Mantra is taught for those more afflicted, if it is asked “Won’t Secret Mantra not be superior since those with great affliction are inferior?” A person is not inferior because his afflictions are great. One who cannot rely on antidotes is inferior. Even though his afflictions are greater, since [afflictions] are destroyed, the method is better. As the Sūtrālamkāra states:

Possessing great methods, 
afflictions become the limbs of awakening;
samsara’s nature is peace,
therefore, the sons of the victores are inconceivable.

For example, if there is nothing other than a small fire (the antidote) it will not be able to utilize a large amount of firewood (the object to abandon). If the fire is larger (the antidote), likewise a large amount of firewood (the object to abandon) will assist the blazing fire.

Malcolm wrote:
So, in Vajrayāna practice, since in the age sentient beings are laden with much greater affliction than in ages past, we pile on the desire objects so that the fire of gnosis will blaze more brightly, through the use of skillful methods. Therefore he adds:


Astus said:
The Yoginīsañcaryam states:

Further, when in a later time,
in the last age siddhi cannot be obtained…
…having understood this Dharma as such,
all that one intends will be completed.

Therefore, followers of the Pāramitāyāna do not accomplish [awakening] in this degenerate age, but followers of Secret Mantra do accomplish [awakening] in this degenerate age. The Herukābhyadaya also states:

If one upholds Śrī Heruka,
There will be accomplishment in the decadent age.

Since that is so, it is reasonable to enter Secret Mantra exactly in the present time.


Malcolm wrote:

Where I see the differences, both in appearence and in general structure, is in some modern Theravada and secular meditation techniques when being compared to what it is described as "jhana" in EBTs. There are some essays, books and studies on the matter of the historical development of the understanding of what is Samma Samadhi and on the assessment of the differences between early and current buddhist views on SS. I'm currently reading "Reexamining Jhana: Towards a Critical Reconstruction of Early Buddhist Soteriology", by Grzegorz Polak, in which he postulates his hypotheses based on his own and multiple previous studies, and by looking into other texts from non-buddhist schools and comparing such texts with what it seems to be the early or no-so-later strata of texts in the Pali Canon. These differences, as far as I'm studying them, seem to be absolutely relevant for the path; it is not merely an academic matter (at least not for me).

The thirty-seven bodhipakṣadharmas are the same in both systems. The difference is solely motivation.

More generally, strict lockdowns does not equate success. We have cases of countries that imposed strict lockdowns and failed due to other factors, and we have examples of the opposite.

Malcolm wrote:
No, actually we don't.

The solution to success in this pandemic is very simple: testing + quarantine + contact tracing. All countries who followed this recipe, such as Taiwan, New Zealand, and so on, are doing fine. Those who failed in any one of these three pillars of pandemic control are not doing very well.

What you are basically proposing is that the authenticity of a given Dharma text or teaching is to be determined on the basis of the contaminated perceptions of common people rather than the uncontaminated insight of āryas. Thus, practitioners invested in the matter of studying Dharma should follow the latter rather than the former.

I can't speak for tkp67, but there is a radical middle ground that is very rarely taken. And that's the rejection that one must necessarily align oneself with this side or that. Admitting that both sides lie and behave dishonourably, which does not equate to moral equivalence (before one jumps to that conclusion). That both sides have been playing the people for a long time. That jumping to conclusions, broad-brushing and striving to demolish one's opponent should give place to listening and finding a common ground to build upon.

One of the reasons that Trump won, it seems to me, was the duplicitous way both sides have played the public for years. Instead of addressing entrenched poverty, lack of basic services (like the healthcare), real inequities and deep systemic suffering, they threw the masses the culture war issues to fight over. Transgender bathrooms. Wedge issues. Divide and conquer.

Trump capitalised on that with his three-pronged platform of anti-corruption (drain the swamp), bring back the jobs and yes, the culture wars, including the best part -  xenophobia, white insecurity and disenfranchisement by a large section of voters.

People take the bait and the Machine trundles on. People like Bernie or Andrew Yang who focus on real issues, don't make it, because it is not about that. That a politician or his/her program have a visceral appeal should be a cause of alarm. Instead in the US, it seems to be a prerequisite. Because it is basically showbiz.

It's an obvious thing to say I take it, but being a good campaigner and being a good administrator have precious little to do with one another. They are almost opposites.

It seems to me that your entire system needs a thorough overhaul. From the divisive press to the nonsense campaign. But it has to start with education. With kids learning critical thinking at schools. Logical fallacies. Evidence-based reasoning. Emotional and psychological manipulation. Mass hysteria. Holding those driving the public discourse accountable for what they say. Truly. A lie and you should hang your head in shame. Yes, bring back shame.

Hello all.

First, I didn't know if this topic was more appropiate for this forum or for the academic discussion forum. Since what I'm asking might interest newcommers to Buddhism (I'm more or less one of them) I decided to post here. Feel free to move this topic to the academic forum or any other forum if you think it belongs there.

I would like to study the history of Mahayana and Vajrayana thought. This means books that cover the history of Buddhist thought from Madhyamaka to Yogacara and Vajrayana Buddhism. I'm interested in covering from Nagarjuna to Tsongkhapa especially, but I wouldn't mind to learn the development of Tibetan Buddhism up until the Rimé movement or even the XXth century. I am currently following the Karma Kagyu linage, so if there are books that include the development of Buddhist thought from Nagarjuna up to the Karma Kagyu (including schools that pre-date the Kagyu but are part of its lineage, like the Kadampa), that would be perfect. But a general perspective on Tibetan Buddhism would be appreaciated. I also don't mind if chapters about East Asian Buddhism like Tientai or Chan are included, as long as Tibetan Buddhism is well covered.

I already know and have read "Mahayana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations" by Paul Williams. It is very similar to what I'm looking for, but I would like to get deeper into the different authors and masters than this book does.

I'm not expecting to find a single book covering all of this in depth, so if you can suggest me several books, each for a different school/period, that would be ok.

Lastly, I don't mind to read "popular" or divulgative books, but what I am looking for right now is academic books similar to those by Paul Williams. I majored in philosophy and I'm used to get deep into the ideas.

Thanks a lot for your attention, best wishes to all and I hope someone can come up with some good book recommendations!

Matter or material form is (1-5) the five sense-faculties, (6-10) the
five object-referents [or object-fields of the five sense-faculties],
arid (11) the non-informative.
So matter/material form is the five sense organs (eyes, ears, tongue, body and nose) and their objects (visual, aural, gustatory, bodily and olfactory sensations).  It seems though that "indriya" does not refer just to the physical sense organs, but to the related sense consciousness as well, to the process of sensing.

As for 11.  The endnote says:
The SA.IV.Glossary.520 describes them as follows:
avijnapti-rupa: Non-informative matter. This is a special type of matter (rupa)
which constitutes a non-informative action (avijnapti-karma). It is non-resistant and
invisible, and comes into existence in dependence on the force of a volition (cetana),
an informative action and a set of great elements (mahabhuta). It is a special type of
derived matter (upadaya-rupa) which is not comprised of atoms (paramanu).
avijnapti-karma: Non-informative action. Unlike an informative action (vijnapti
karma) which informs us of the mental state of the doer, this is a karmic force which,
once projected by a bodily or vocal action (karma), continues to exist as a series
invisibly; hence, non-informative.
Clear as mud, right?

Malcolm wrote:
Avijnapti is created by taking vows. The discussIon of it is pursued at length in the karma chapter.

(Entry into the Two Realities by Atisa, in Jewels of the Middle Way, p 119)

akuppa said:
So from the Madhyamaka pov it is more correct to say that consciousness arises and ceases than to say a self exists. If both are empty, how can this be the case? What kind of logic is used to assert this?

Malcolm wrote:
No, it is not more correct to say consciousness arises or ceases than a labelled self, a since consciousness is also a conventional label, like the label "self." Prior to analysis there is both a self, akuppa, and a consciousness. After analysis one will find neither self nor consciousness, beyond the designations "akuppa" and "consciousness." For example, take a car as a metaphor for "self". A car cannot be found in any part, all of its parts, or separate from its parts. Likewise, as self cannot be found in any aggregates, all of the aggregates, or apart from the aggregates. Likewise, consciousness cannot be found in the sense organ nor the sense object, both, or separate from them. The mind is also made of parts, and cannot be found in one of them, all of them, or separate from them.

Functionally speaking, we can say there is a self, because when I say "akuppa go there!" You will respond to this directive by saying yes or no. This means that "self" is functional. It is efficient. Whatever is functional corresponds with relative truth. If I said to you, "Malcolm go there!" you would respond, "I am not Malcolm." So calling you "malcolm" is not functional and therefore cannot be considered to be relatively true. Consciousness is a relative truth, as long as it performs its functions, then we can say "there is a consciousness." But when we analyze consciousness, we cannot find it outside of the conventions we use for an appearance we label "mind."

Hi there,

Though there is some variation between schools, it is typically taught that the consequences/vipaka of karma ripen on the individual that generated that karma alone.

What I do not really understand is that, as far as I know, it is the volition aggregate that generates karma, but other aggregates are involved in experiencing the vipaka (eg the body can become diseased). As the aggregates are merely strongly interdependent rather than being “the same thing” even on a conventional level, and interdependence extends beyond the aggregates, what is the basis for the “overflow” effect of vipaka being limited to the individual?

Malcolm wrote:
Mind streams are individual, that’s all.

GrapeLover said:
That is fair enough. How is the mindstream held to affect the body, in terms of eg developing a disease at some point due to a karmic seed? It seems like the body would have to be "inside" the mindstream and everything else outside it, in order for individual mindstreams to explain things fully.

Malcolm wrote:
The body and mind are inseparable, like a flower and its scent.

GrapeLover said:
What I basically mean is that (sorry for the silly analogy)—if I clap my hands outside and it can’t be heard a mile away, that is because the ‘force’ of the clap isn’t sufficient, even though there is interconnection between the two areas and the clap can be heard to some extent for a fair distance. This AFAIK would be a broad parallel to a Kegon-style illustration of effects resonating out, but being stronger at the ‘epicentre’.

On the other hand, if I clapped in a soundproof chamber and it couldn’t be heard outside, this is basically because there isn’t even interconnection or the potential for the sound to travel outside at all. If this is like how mindstreams are, then the body would seem to need to be “inside” the chamber of the mindstream in order for karma to affect it, while other phenomena are outside.

Malcolm wrote:
I think you have not properly studied the doctrine of karma. See chapter 4, Abhidharmakośabhaṣya.

Karma is not simple cause and effect, though is is often misrepresented this way. Karma is moral cause and effect, which determines happy and unhappy states of existence.

In Abhidharmakośabhaṣya, simple cause and effect are presented first in the section on the six causes and four conditions described in chapter 2. Then comes dependent origination, chapter 3; and after that karma and its results, chapter 4.

Your example is an instance of simple cause and effect, but this is not karmic cause and effect. For example, one of the reasons I never found Huayen and Tiantai particularly profound with all their talk of interpenetration, mutuality and so on, is that this is already covered in the Sarvāstivādin kāraṇa-hetu. This means that all things are automatically the cause of all other things apart from themselves.

Awkwardly split from Why choose Mahāyāna over Vajrayāna?

The topic has another question hidden in it: How does the śrāvaka stream-entrant differ in his realization from the bodhisattva stream-entrant other than the former theoretically missing the foundations of bodhicitta?
So by your logic, all stream-entrants are awakened as well. Stream-entrants are significantly beneath Arhats. I thought the stream-entrant only makes contact once with nirvāṇa as a mental object, and doesn't abide in it with life substratum.

Aemilius said:
Stream entrants are Aryas, the first stage of it. I wonder where has all the knowledge about them disappeared?

ārya-saṃgha (Sanskrit, noble community). The community of the āryas or those ‘noble persons’ (ārya-pudgala) who have attained the supermundane path (ārya-mārga). This is the Saṃgha referred to in the formula of the three refuges (triśaraṇa), and is distinct from the broader Buddhist community including laymen and laywomen.
Source
：
A Dictionary of Buddhism, Oxford University Press, 2003, 2004 (which is available in electronic version from answer.com)

ārya-pudgala (Sanskrit; Pāli, ariya-puggala). A ‘noble person’, one who is at any stage of the Noble Path (ārya-mārga). There are four such persons, namely the stream-winner (śrotāpanna), the once-returner (sakṛdāgāmin), the non-returner (anāgāmin) and the Arhat. According to an alternative sevenfold grouping found in Pāli sources individuals enter the Noble Path in different ways according to their personal disposition. In terms of this the noble disciples are classified as: (1) one who follows in faith (saddhā-anusārin); (2) one liberated by faith (saddhā-vimutta); (3) one who witnesses with the body (kāya-sakkhi); (4) one liberated both ways (ubhato-bhāga-vimutta); (5) one who follows in the Dharma (dhamma-anusārin); (6) one who has attained to vision (diṭṭhippatta); (7) one liberated by insight (paññā-vimutta). Thus the Noble Path may be attained through faith (as with the first), or through an intellectual grasp of the teachings (as with the fifth). One may also enter it and reach fruition on the basis of both (as with the fourth).



There is quite a lot in the Abhidharma about this under various headings, like the Eight noble persons (arya pudgala) etc...

Caoimhghín said:
I'm aware that they are the first persons of the path, but I'm not sure if those who are less than Arhats count as "awakened" without any significant caveats. The once-returner, for instance, is not necessarily awakened, but will be in the future. He only has a partial awakening. It would be odd for a stream-entrant to have superior realization than the once-returner yet to once return.

Aemilius said:
The classification is at first quite simple, and then more and more evolved and complex, in the Sutras and Abhidharma.
A stream entrant has maximum 7 rebirths left before Arhatship. These seven can take place in different ways, so we get more different stream entrants. 1.The stream entrants can be faith followers or wisdom followers, or a yogic type (body witness) this exists but is interpreted differently or it is simply "forgotten". One can also change type in the course of the seven or less births.
2.  Are only births on Earth (or Jambudvipa) counted, or are births in other realms, on other continents or other planets equally valid ?? Etc...


You can compare the Aryas with the systems of Noblity and Aristocrats, that have existed in many many  parts of the world:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobility

Caoimhghín said:
I agree it's complex, but it does strike me as odd that the once-returner with his partial awakening as an unripened wisdom that only completely fruits later would be less awakened than the stream-entrant with his seven lifetimes until arhatva. Of course, bodhisattva stream-entry does not result in seven lifetimes until arhatva.

Arguably one of the reasons why the stream-entrant is called a stream-entrant is because he has merely "entered the stream" to awakening. His seven lifetimes, or dare we say his three aeons, are the consequence of that entrance then, at least seven to make it up the stream to "the other shore" in the case of the path as the Buddha outlined it to the śrāvakas.

Hello dear forum.

After some years of studying Eastern and Buddhist thought in university and on my free time, I decided to approach a Sangha to receive teachings. Since I felt Tibetan Buddhism attracted me more, I decided to approach a Karma Kagyu center close to where I live. Sadly, right now, because of the coronavirus, they only teach online. Luckily, however, they had just started the Lojong lessons so I have been attending them online for 2 weeks now. The Lama asked us to meditate for one hour every day. Since this is the beginning of Lojong, and of meditation for many of us, she suggested that we should just try to relax in meditation position for one hour. However, I have found this extremely difficult. I have tried to do it with some relaxing music but it keeps being difficult. It is difficult for my eyes to look at the same place for a long time so I keep moving them. I try just to relax, but usually I manage to be relaxed only the first 10-15 minutes of the session. The rest of the hour is very hard. I have tried to shorten it for 40 minutes but it keeps being difficult. I try not to refuse my thoughts, but just try to be more or less comfortably relaxed, but I keep getting anxious and find it difficult to just be seated without doing nothing. The Lama said it can be difficult since a part of us doesn't want to meditate, and that we should keep trying until our mind gets used to it.

Do you guys have some tips/advice to give to me? I guess starting to meditate is difficult for most of the people, so I try not to be desperate about it. However, little by little I would like to see some progress. I have read for years about Buddhism and I feel it may be my path, but its not the same to read about it than to actually practice it, so even if I try not to desperate I can't help but be worried that because of finding meditation too difficult I might not be able to follow the path.

Thanks a lot for your time,

Jon

the conditioned factors are the fivefold aggregates:
material form, etc.
The skandha. Etymological meaning of samskrta
"that which has been
made (krta) by causes or conditions [pratyaya] co-existing in assemblage (sametya,
sambhuya)".
So far, so good. "that which has been made ... ", also
applies (1) to future factors, (2) to present factors, as well as (3) to past factors; in
fact, a factor (dharma) does not change its nature or type [jatiyatvat] by changing
its time period.
Really?  So what happens when ice (solid) becomes water (liquid) and then evaporates as steam (gas)?  Is there not a change in type?

Malcolm wrote:
Later, when the discussion of "partless atoms" comes up, you will see that atoms are irreducible. However, states of matter such as solids, liquids, and gasses depend on the balance of the four elements in material entities and the environment. In other words, one has ice when it is cold, and when it is very hot, water evaporates into a gas.

But the atoms themselves, according to Abhidharma typology of the Sarvastivadins do not undergo change or alteration. The Sautrantikas, you will see, reject the notion of partless atoms because they have are also claimed to have sides, etc. It is important to keep in mind that the root verses present a version of Sarvastivadin doctrine, that of the Vaibhāsikas. The commentaries mainly critiques these positions from the Sautrantika position.

There is a long end note on this from page 322-324 that I had to read a couple times.

The example given is the color (sorry, colour) blue, this is unique to that dharma. Blue also belongs to a group of dharmas that share a common characteristic, in this case they can be seen.

I'm not sure I follow the "dependently arise objects have inherent characteristics" question.

And yet science shows us that if you do not have the corresponding rods and cones (sensory apparatus of the eye) then blue is not blue for you.

So how can it be an inherent characteristic when it is dependently arisen?

Malcolm wrote:
"Inherent" is really the wrong word here. "Intrinsic" is a little better. In this case, a blue entity possesses the physical properties to reflect blue light, whether one can see it or not. That entity dependently arises in possession of that property. While that entity exists, one of its intrinsic characteristics is to reflect blue light. Intrinsic characteristics do not conflict with dependent origination in Sarvastivada and Sautrantika tenets.

Also "ultimate" in Abdhidharma simply means the cognition left over after one has smashed or analyzed something as far as one can go.

Abhidharma in the absolute sense: pure understanding
Understanding (prajna), is the discernment
of factors [dharmapravicaya].
Pravicaya is the Sanskrit term for discernment and refers to the ability to distinguish pure from impure, material from immaterial, etc... 2b. [The Abhidharma] is also any understanding and the Treatise which
make one obtain stainless understanding.
...the impure (sasrava) understanding, whether it is
i. innate or natural or acquired at birth
ii-iv. derived from an effort, i.e., from listening, reflection, cultivation
By innate I imagine it is referring to it being a consequence of past effort.  I assume this as it is talking about impure understanding and thus cannot be referring to some sort of internal stainless basis/quality.

We also clearly see here that prajna (unafflicted knowledge) is also based on personal effort and study the Treatise also makes one obtain the pure understanding...
Thus studying the text... Etymological explanation of dharma and abhi-dharma
[Etymologically,] dharma signifies: that which upholds or sustains (dharana) its own
characteristic or a particular inherent characteristic (svalaksana).

The Abhidharma is called abhi-dharma because it is directed...
1. toward the supreme factor [paramarthadharma], namely, Nirvana
2. toward the characteristics of the factors [dharmalaksana], namely, (i) the
particular inherent characteristics or specific characteristics [svalaksana]
and (ii) the common characteristics [samanyalaksana].

Quarantine, masks social distancing, remain, at this point, the most effective measures for dealing with this infection.

Indeed

But then right from the beginning it is an invalid question.
how 'student' may know if a teacher is or is not awakened??? if he knows, he/she does not need any teacher at all, since possess enough wisdom to go on his/her own.
If one does not know, then there is no way for such person to discern if a teacher, or teachers or whoever is or is not awakened.

What I observed in the West is, that if people like a certain teacher then they do believe he has some special quality or wisdom or is enlightened etc. but once they stop to like the teacher, then exactly the same person is told to be unenlightened and in possession of bad qualities.

So if you ask such question I guess that mostly answer will relate to confused human minds of likes and dislikes. And it has nothing to do with the notion of a zen teacher and his awakening.

We are not resting in awareness, we are resting in the natural state of the mind, clarity and emptiness. We use mindfulness and awareness in tandem to sustain resting in the nature of the mind. We are aware of something in Dzogchen and Mahamudra, that is, a moment of unfabricated consciousness. But we are not resting in awareness per se. Mindfulness (dran pa) and awareness (shes bzhin) are two mental factors that always function together. If one is aware, one is mindful, if one is mindful, one is aware. Clarity on the other hand is not a mental factor, it is part of the nature of the mind, just as one aspect of the nature of water is wetness. But it is the nature of the mind is not only clarity, it is also empty, just as limpidity is also an aspect of the nature of water.

I agree it's complex, but it does strike me as odd that the once-returner with his partial awakening as an unripened wisdom that only completely fruits later would be less awakened than the stream-entrant with his seven lifetimes until arhatva. Of course, bodhisattva stream-entry does not result in seven lifetimes until arhatva.

Arguably one of the reasons why the stream-entrant is called a stream-entrant is because he has merely "entered the stream" to awakening. His seven lifetimes, or dare we say his three aeons, are the consequence of that entrance then, at least seven to make it up the stream to "the other shore" in the case of the path as the Buddha outlined it to the śrāvakas.

I think it is also of the greatest importance for tantra. Because the tantric Yidams shall not be visualized as inherently existing objects. So it is important to remind myself all the time that they are emptiness-appearance, like the moon reflected in water.

One of the features of secret mantra, which perhaps Nichiren did not like much (even though he was clearly quite adept at secret mantra practice as it exists in Tendai Mikkyo) is that its Japanese expression is clearly elitist, expensive, and requires a prodigious amount of education in mandala theory, mudra practice, and so on. But this is perhaps a reflection of how secret mantra was practiced in India during the late 7th and 8th centuries. In Tibet too, during the same period, secret mantra was very elitist, expensive, and so on. It was practiced basically the same way it was practiced in Japan.

However, because Tibet is closer to India, the more populist expression of secret mantra in the HYT also made inroads, and of course, Dzogchen and later Mahāmudra, is part of that movement.

I am interested in this point—I’ve never really properly reconciled the fact that Buddhas are emanations with the jatakas etc (eg, can there be a meaningful personal link between the last life of a bodhisattva and the following nirmanakaya? As the Buddha’s mind is dharmakaya wherein there is no distinction between Buddhas, what does it mean for them to say “in one of my past lives”?)

Who is the person and Buddha in question here? Is it something quite ‘high-level’ like a figure attaining Buddhahood under Samantabhadra and emanating all the Buddhas of this eon?

Thanks for putting so much into this thread.

Malcolm wrote:
According to the Lo rgyus chen mo found in the Vima sNying thig, there was a person who trained under three nirmanakāya buddhas in three successive incarnations in the previous mahākalpa, and attained buddhahood himself. During the 20 void eons, this buddha remained latent since there was no manifest physical universe, etc. When the physical universe again manifested at the beginning of this mahākalpa, this buddha's dharmakāya manifested the sambhogakāya, etc., and also the first nirmankāya buddha of the first eon, Ngangwa Dampa, who taught the Sound Tantras as well as the remainder of the 17 tantras.

Buddhas may have the same realization, but their omniscience is such thay they can distinguish between the different mind streams that led to their common realization. For example, if we are seated at the Met, looking at Monet's lily pond, we are all looking at the same painting, even though we arrived at different times from different places, and left to go to different destinations. We can understand the realizations of the buddhas just like that.

Astus said:
'In the expository, causal vehicle of the paramitas, the sugatagarbha or buddha-nature is considered to be present in the minds of beings only as a seed. When this is fully developed through circumstantial conditions— in other words, the two accumulations (of merit and wisdom) — buddhahood is attained. And since the cause comes first and its result after, one speaks in this case of a causal vehicle. By contrast, the Mantrayana, the vehicle of mantra, proclaims that all beings are by nature endowed with the sugatagarbha, wherein all enlightened qualities are spontaneously present.'
(Treasury of Precious Qualities, vol 2, p 86)

Unlike the above description of sutrayana, in Chan, Tiantai, and Huayan buddha-nature is understood to be already complete with the buddha qualities, as already noted in The Awakening Of Faith In Mahayana:

'Next, Suchness has two aspects if predicated in words. One is that it is truly empty (sunya), for this aspect can, in the final sense, reveal what is real. The other is that it is truly nonempty (a-sunya), for its essence itself is endowed with undefiled and excellent qualities.'

Malcolm wrote:
That does not matter. Let's say you have a house, and in your house is a million dollars. If you never discover the million dollars or it is never shown to you, you will have a million dollars and never know it. Likewise, unless those buddha qualities are discovered by you in a direct perception, or pointed out to you, even if you have them, they are of no use to you.

As far as Dzogchen view goes, such qualities exist in the form of potential only. The analogy Longchenpa uses is that even though you may not need to gather the two accumulations ultimately in order to possess the kāyas and wisdoms, practicing the two accumulations is like polishing a dirty gem. One is not really adding anything new, but instead one is revealing what is already there, but hidden from ordinary sight.

How do you enter a pure land with karma ..

Only the most average of Dzogchen practitioners take birth in the natural nirmanakāya buddhafields. They have left samsara behind forever.

IN order to understand the different grades of rebirth in Sukhavati, you would have to read the long Sukhavati sūtra. However, as I pointed out above, that sūtra is not read in Tibetan Buddhism.

Realizing emptiness in Dzogchen means realizing the original purity of all phenomena, in common with the perfection of wisdom sūtras, etc., and the naturally perfect nature of all phenomena.

This brings up another issue: why are only bodhisattvas of a certain bhūmi or higher mahāsattvas (and this bhūmi is not usually given as the first)? Similarly, take the Heart Sutra for example, which depicts Avalokiteśvara gaining insight into emptiness. He is also depicted as perfecting wisdom-perfection (prajñāpāramitā) in that sūtra, so is he at the first bhūmi, a bodhisattva stream-entrant, or is this entrance into the eighth bhūmi, which is more likely? How does the śrāvaka stream-entrant differ in his realization from the bodhisattva stream-entrant other than the former theoretically missing the foundations of bodhicitta?

Astus said:
It depends on whom you ask, as there are various views about sravakas (and bodhisattvas) in different Mahayana works. What separates the four noble persons on the sravaka path is not in their attainment of insight into the four noble truths, but how much of the fetters they have removed permanently.

Caoimhghín said:
And there is no furthering of wisdom or insight accompanied by the loosening of these fetters? I'm not a śrāvaka literature expert. It strikes me as there is a furthering of insight and a gradual deepening of wisdom in the way that the bodhisattva path is described as the bodhisattva progresses.

Are there any wisdoms that an arhat has that a stream-entrant lacks? I suppose that would answer the question.

I agree it's complex, but it does strike me as odd that the once-returner with his partial awakening as an unripened wisdom that only completely fruits later would be less awakened than the stream-entrant with his seven lifetimes until arhatva. Of course, bodhisattva stream-entry does not result in seven lifetimes until arhatva.

Arguably one of the reasons why the stream-entrant is called a stream-entrant is because he has merely "entered the stream" to awakening. His seven lifetimes, or dare we say his three aeons, are the consequence of that entrance then, at least seven to make it up the stream to "the other shore" in the case of the path as the Buddha outlined it to the śrāvakas.

Taoist yoga really requires very little to no scholarly or philosophical knowledge to practice. It's not taught the way Buddhist methods are at all, and even native Chinese speakers who write authoritative books on it tend to teach it without a lot of reliance on written sources, in my experience. It is not a scholarly tradition in the manner of Buddhadharma, or at least the scholarly tradition seems more optional.

Further, some teachers say that the academizing of it came after the fact, and that the original Taoist "yogis" were anything but scholars. For instance, Tai Chi certainly did not come from the Tai Chi classics nor the volumes and volumes of esoteric literature surrounding it, that all came much later.

As far as the actual religious/philosophical content, it's pretty essentialist in my experience. The worldview of Taosim sort of precludes the notion of Samsara, in my opinion. It's interesting and I think does intersect in places with some Buddhist teachings, but it's clearly a different worldview, and the ultimate goal of the yogic method itself of creating a "shen baby" really differs from Buddhist methods. You could find parallels with Phowa etc., but it's it's own deal.

Malcolm correct me if i'm wrong.
You did the three year three month three day completion stage tantra in tibet...At least thats what i recall Namdrol saying on E-Sangha.
At the time that was the end all and be all ...so is that vajrayana ?

Now it's Dzogchen is the fastest but you got to wait till ya die .

so whats up with this.
Completion stage Tantra on the back burner or did you just discard the whole idea.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, I did a three year retreat. Not in tibet, however, but in Western Mass. I was already practicing Dzogchen at that time.

I never said you have to wait until you die to achieve awakening. Full awakening, buddhahood, is a different story. You and I are not going to attain buddhahood in this lifetime. But can we attain awakening is this lifetime? Of course we can.

I read those books long ago, but probably you are right, from those words it could be interpreted that way. The only published source I know where Frantzis gets more philosophical is an audio course on the Tao Te Ching, this is going to be published as a book so I think there you will see these terms defined more precisely and related to emptiness.

Well I could never follow the Buddhist criticism of Taoism on this site since the Taoist teachings I have do talk about and introduce you to emptiness not as a fixed nothing, but the empty infinite potential of the individual and eventually much later on how this integrates or becomes one with the emptiness of all and everything (aka universal consciousness).

Malcolm wrote:
Not sure you can equate Taoist nonbeing (wu) with śūnyāta.

However, it is unclear from the term "universal consciousness" when contrasted with "individual consciousness" that Frantzis is not proposing some kind of brahmin.

Anyway, Dzogchen teachings very clearly negate the kind of nondual consciousness proposed by Hindus such as Shankara, etc. I don't see how Frantzis is saying something any different than Advaita, on this score, based on what he states in his second book.

I am personally sure it is an authentic endorsement from ChNN, having been a student of both for 20 years. If you are not sure then why not ask the International Gakyil or SSI to clarify. Many students of Bruce Frantzis were also students of ChNN and asked ChNN questions about how to integrate the two teachings for example so this may be how ChNN became familiar with Bruce Frantzis's teachings (which are not neo-Taoism, they are in the lineage of Lao Tzu's Water method or old Taoism).

Very occasionally Bruce Frantzis does teach Dzogchen, once that I know of and attended myself. Also as far as I know Lama Wangdor was not endorsing teachers for political reasons. The three I know all have relaxed, informal and spontaneous styles of teachings but are all serious committed teachers successfully helping many people. For those of you who very much like polite, formal, very structured philosophical styles these teachers are probably not for you.

With respect to time, I tend to think of this excerpt from the Vimalakirti Sutra:

“The bodhisattva who lives in the inconceivable liberation, for the sake of disciplining those living beings who are disciplined through immeasurable periods of evolution, can make the passing of a week seem like the passing of an eon, and he can make the passing of an eon seem like the passing of a week for those who are disciplined through a short period of evolution. The living beings who are disciplined through an immeasurable period of evolution actually perceive a week to be the passing of an eon, and those disciplined by a short period of evolution actually perceive an eon to be the passing of a week.”

It seems like if there’s anywhere that you’d be under the very direct influence of Buddhas and bodhisattvas dwelling in the inconceivable liberation then it would be a Pure Land. So it seems to me that as much time will seem to pass as suits the individual to be developed. The “actual” time that has passed in the meantime would seem to be immaterial.

Malcolm wrote:
There are two points. The first point is whether or not there is a guarantee of immediate rebirth in Sukhavati. Some people assert there is, some people assert there is not. The text of the vows pretty much excludes those who have committed any of the five karmas of immediate retribution, despite Shinran's assertions. "Thinking of Amitabha ten times" is also pretty vague.

Beyond this, there is the fact that Tibetan Buddhists such as myself only read the the smaller Sukhavativyuha. This does not mean that the large sūtra is invalid, it was just never translated into Tibetan, and thus, plays no part in Tibetan Buddhist understandings of Sukhavati. Moreover, the large sūtra extolls the benefits of practicing virtue in this life above that of practicing in Sukhavati:

GrapeLover said:
If you strictly observe the precepts of abstinence with upright thought and mindfulness even for a day and a night, the merit acquired will surpass that of practicing good in the land of Amitāyus for a hundred years. The reason is that in that buddha land of effortless spontaneity all the inhabitants do good without committing even a hair’s breadth of evil. If in this world you do good for ten days and nights, the merit acquired will surpass that of practicing good in the buddha lands of other directions for a thousand years.

Malcolm wrote:
Three Pure Land Sūtras, BDK, pp. 55

As for those stuck in lotus flowers:

GrapeLover said:
The Buddha said to Maitreya, “Those beings born within the lotus buds are like that. Because of their doubt of the Buddha’s wisdom they have been born in palaces. Although they receive no punishment or ill treatment even for a single moment, they must pass five hundred years there without being able to see the Three Treasures, make offerings to the Buddha, or cultivate a store of virtue. This is distressing to them. Though there are other pleasures, they do not enjoy living there.

Malcolm wrote:
Three Pure Land Sūtras, BDK, pp. 59

In general, the sutra itself offers a carrot and stick approach. Sukhavati is the carrot; but you cannot get there without being a good Dharma practitioner, practicing the path of renunciation. Not only this, but the small sūtra makes it clear that this devotional practice should occur in the week before one's death, hence the reason why most Pure Land practice in Tibetan Buddhism is taken up at the end of a person's life. And finally, as stated above, the merit of Dharma practice in this Sahaloka far surpasses the merit of Dharma practice in Sukhavati.

"Dictionary of Buddhist Terms and Concepts"
Vairocana [毘盧遮那]
A Buddha who appears in the Kegon, Bommo, and Dainichi sutras. The Kegon Sutra in particular describes his pure land, the Lotus Treasury World. A great image of Vairocana made of gold was erected at Todaiji Temple in Nara as a result of a vow made by Emperor Shomu in 743. It was consecrated in 752. The Shingon Sect equates Vairocana with its central deity, Mahavairocana. The Shingon teaching regards the entire universe as a manifestation of this Buddha. See Also Dainichi.
Dainichi [大日如来]: (Skt. Mahavairocana)
The Buddha worshiped in esoteric teaching. Often referred to as Dainichi Nyorai (Mahavairocana Tathagata). This Buddha is mentioned in the Dainichi and Kongocho Sutras. He is regarded as the Buddha in the Dharma Body or Property of the Law (Jap hosshin, Skt. Dharma-kaya) aspect who personifies the unchanging truth of all phenomena and is the source from which all other Buddha and Bodhisattvas spring. The esoteric teaching holds that Dainichi is always expounding the Law in this universe and that the common mortal can fuse his life with this Buddha through the practice of the three mysteries. Dainichi has two aspects, the Dainichi of the womb world who represents the fundamental truth of the universe, and the Dainichi of the Diamond Wolrd who represents wisdom. These two are fundamentally one. The Tendai and Shingon forms of esotericism differ in their interpretations of Dainichi. The former holds that Dainichi is the Property of the Law aspect, and Shakyamuni, the property of action aspect, of the same Buddha, while the latter maintains that they are two entirely distinct Buddhas.
The Shingon teaching regards the entire universe as a manifestation of this Buddha

Buddha recollection will not result in Buddhahood in one life. Yoga does.

Astus said:
Do you mean anybody who did yoga - whatever that means - once for ten minutes attains buddhahood in this life? Or if one does yoga very well for thirty years, buddhahood is guaranteed to happen then? Because those who faithfully recite the name of Amitabha even just ten times are guaranteed to be born in Sukhavati, and once there, buddhahood is guaranteed as well, no fall back possible. So although one may practise yoga throughout one's life, unless buddhahood was actually attained, one should still aim to be born in Sukhavati.

As Thrangu Rinpoche says in chapter 12 of Luminous Clarity:

'To be reborn in most of the great pure realms, one needs an immeasurable store of merit. There is an exception to this, however, which is the pure realm of Sukhavati. Although it is hard to get in to an authentic pure realm, it is easy to be born into the realm of Sukhavati because of the aspiration of the Buddha Amitabha. So Karma Chagme advises us to make the intense aspiration to achieve rebirth in Sukhavati because if we are not born in a pure realm, then we might be reborn in one of the higher realms within samsara, which is still samsara. So we wish to achieve awakening through the practice of the generation and completion stages and the practice of Mahamudra and Dzogchen. But if this does not happen, we can ensure that we are reborn in a pure realm. We are therefore advised to aspire for a rebirth in Sukhavati.'

Of course Zen - like Japanese mikkyo (Shingon, Tendai, Shugen) - lacks the same understanding of channels and chakras that developed  in later vajrayana.

Malcolm wrote:
To put it succinctly, the reason we have four empowerments in HYT is that we have what are called the four mandalas: the nāḍīs, nāḍī syllables, bindu, and vāyu.

The dependent origination of the human body begins with the ālayavijñāna mounted upon what is known as the "great prāṇavāyu" merging with the reproductive material of a male and a female. The mind is not differentiable from the vāyu (aka winds or airs) in any meaningful way. Thus, the newly formed zygote is shaped through the internal movement of vāyu/mind and its movement forms nāḍis in the body, which are in the form of syllables, filled with bindus, that are propelled by vāyu over the process of human gestation.

The shape of our body, our perception of the world, our thoughts, afflictive disposition and so on is largely governed by this anatomy. So, to recap: based on conception there is the mandala of vāyu; based on the reproductive material of the parents, there is the mandala of bindu. Based on the formation of knots (grantha) in the naḍīs, there are syllables. And finally, based on the full development of the human body there is the external structure of the nāḍī system, which one should understand as the arteries, blood vessels, and nervous system in the human body, These nāḍīs contain the other three elements, the syllables, bindus, and vāyus. The four empowerments are the purifier of the basis purification, these four mandalas. If we fail to attain buddhahood during the empowerment, then we have the method of practicing sadhanas with the creation and completion stage. The creation stage has two parts: the outer creation stage and the inner creation stage. The outer creation stage purifies afflictions of our bardo experiences, conceptions, gestations and deaths from beginningless lifetime, and all the activities of daily life, eating, sleeping, wearing clothes, sex, etc. The inner creation acts as a purifier for the four mandalas described above. However, creation stage is not sufficient for buddhahood, though it is sufficient for awakening on the impure bhumis. For buddhahood, one needs to practice the completion stage practices with its prāṇāyāma practices, sexual yogas [which frankly are a lot of work and not really that erotic], etc., because the creation stage is largely a conceptual samadhi framework, unifying appearance and emptiness, while the completion stage is what takes one beyond mind with nonconceptual samadhi of clarity and emptiness, bliss and emptiness, and great bliss and emptiness, also known as the connate. The completion stage is how one enters the state called sahajajñāna or mahāmudra.

Cakras in the body are places where arteries, nerves, and blood vessels all work together to produce various major functions in the body: the brain for example is understood to govern sense cognition, hence it is called the mahasukha cakra, the cakra of great bliss. The throat cakra governs speech, swallowing, and so on, hence it is called the sambogacakra. The heart cakra governs consciousness and circulation, hence it is called the dharmacakra; the navel cakra governs metabolism and the development of the body, hence it is called the nirmanacakra, and there is another mahāsukha cakra in the genital region that governs reproduction.

The crown cakra represents the nirmankāya and is the basis for its realization; the throat cakra represents the sambhogakāya and is the basis for its realization. The heart cakra represents the dharmak̄ya and governs it realization. The navel cakra represents the svabhavakāya, and governs its realization. The four empowerments condition these four cakras and plant the seed of the four kāyas in them.

The knots formed in the nạ̄dīs because of our karma and affliction govern how we perceive the world. For example, there is a nāḍī in the body, which, if one's vāyu gets "stuck" there, will cause one to experience the world as a preta experiences the world. The idea here is that all of our experience of the six lokas is actually predicated on our bodies and how it is formed. Therefore, the way to prevent rebirth in the six lokas is to purify all causes for rebirth in the six lokas through understanding the dependent origination of the body.

All of our beginningless past-life samsaric experience is actually stored in our present physical form, which is the expression of traces of karma and affliction. Therefore, the Buddha has taught us that the fastest way to eliminate all karma and affliction as well as is traces is to use the body as our method. Not only that, but through the use of physical bliss, and various types of prāṇāyāma, one can rapidly induce profound samadhis that in sūtric contexts take not only years to develop but lifetimes, because the process of advancing on the paths and stages over many lifetimes corresponds to a bodhisattva taking birth in more and more refined bodies until such bodhisattvas cease taking birth in upper half of the desire realm at all after the eighth bhumiu is realized. This process of constant rebirth is bypassed in Vajrayāna, because in Vajrayāna one works directly with the dependent origination of the body inwardly, not outwardly. It is for this reason that Vajrayāna asserts its superior ability to lead a superior practitioner to full buddhahood, characterized as freedom and omniscience, within a single lifetime. Rather than predicating its practice on renunciation; Vajrayāna predicates its approach on transformation; therefore, Vajrayāna practitioners do not need to abandon using meat, alcohol, sexual activity, etc., as they must in common Mahayāna. These activities are all transformed in the context of the sadhana practice. The process of attaining buddhahood is based on the increasingly subtle states of samadhi which are cultivated in each of the completion stage practices, which are connected with the process of straightening the knots of the nāḍīs, then purifying the bindus, and finally, working with the vāyu mandala in the end. The samadhi associated with these three stages of completion practice are increasingly more subtle. While a consort, whether physical or visualized, is not necessary for the first of these three phases, in many Vajrayāna systems it is argued that one is needed for the final two phases of completion stage practice if one is to attain buddhahood in this life. Also the consort has to be the same level of practitioner as oneself. For example, an unawakened bodhisattva cannot have an awakened consort, and vice versa. Some Vajrayānas systems however claim that such a consort is not needed at all. So there are some arguments about this issue.

Thus, the whole point of this kind of HYT practice, to put it plainly, is to reverse dependent origination of the body/mind complex in toto through practices that are directly based on the anatomy of the human body, understood through how it develops in the process of gestation.

The point is, that in Vajrayana & Dzogchen you work with the body.

If one is a practitioner of Vajrayana or Dzogchen, you can at least ward off Vajra hell with daily Hundred-Syllable recitations and so on; however for something to really “happen” in this lifetime, you need the methods for working with the body somehow (the details of which are of course not up for public discussion).

No idea when concern with these things entered into Chan circles. If we are to believe that the episode partly recorded in Mumonkan case 40 actually occurred, then that means late 8th/early 9th century:

Malcolm wrote:
If you have had a chance to read Van Schaik's book, Tibetan Zen, it is pretty clear that there were Chan Buddhists in Dun Huang who were interested in the Vajayāna systems that were being promulgated in Tibet. What is equally interesting to note, is that they were pretty clear on the differences between the two systems and did not seek to conflate them.

The term "direction introduction" is a term that was coined by Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche as a translation of " rang ngo thog du sprad." As a translation, the term really only translates " thog tu sprad." " Rang ngo " literally means "one's face." Sprad pa means "to introduce" in the sense of meeting ( sprod) face to face ( ngo ). So whose state or face is one being introduced to? One's face ( rang ngo ).

In Kagyu Mahāmudra, the term ngo sprod, usually translated in their texts as "pointing out" is used. While the term ngo sprod is used in all schools for introduction, not all introductions are the same. Some are very gradual, like Karma Kagyu Mahāmudra. Others, like Dzogchen direct introduction, or literally Introducing one's own state (literally "face") are sudden. But also these kinds of sudden direct introductions also exist in Mahāmudra, since Mahāmudra, like Dzogchen, is a path of self-liberation (rang grol). Mahamudra is often introduced more gradually than Dzogchen in general, but it is actually a cig car ba, or sudden entry path like Dzogchen, and like Dzogchen, can be introduced immediately. Really, the main difference between Mahāmudra and Dzogchen is that the former is based on the tantras and dohas of the 9th and 10th century mahāsiddhas, and Dzogchen is based on the tantras and dohas of 7th and 8th century mahāsiddhas. I suppose some would like to argue that Chan is based in the teachings of a 5th century mahāsiddha, Bodhidharma.

Just a note about your experience with Tulku Orgyen—in general, this kind of introduction is the basis of the path. In Dzogchen teachings, one starts there. The experience discovered in that introduction is taken as the basis, upon which the student then works with the teacher to gain confidence in the experience of the introduction. Though Dzogchen is a part of secret mantra, early Nyingmapa authors like Rongzom make it extremely clear that those who did not understand or grasp the introduction right away may practice either mantra practices or regular śamatha and vipaśyanā combined with Dzogchen view. This is known in Dzogchen teachings as the indirect path.

Further, having received introduction, one is then permitted to use various methods to stabilize one's experience of introduction.  But the key point is that in order to begin the Dzogchen path, or even general secret mantra, one must receive direct introduction in the beginning.

Thus, upon receiving direct introduction, one is then authorized to engage in many practices which are used to stabilize the experience of the introduction; and in fact serve as a means where the student then becomes responsible for directly encountering their own state ( rang ngo thog du sprad ). So, while direct introduction is the entry way into the path of Dzogchen teachings and some people get it right away (but such people are rare as stars in the daytime), if the average person does not cultivate the experience of direct introduction somewhat systematically, then Dzogchen remains something like a fantasy.

When we come to regular secret mantra, in Path and Result system of the Sakyapa, before one can even begin to meditate on the so-called creation stage, one is to meditate on what is known as the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana. Without going into detail, the point is that one is using the experience of the introduction during the four empowerments as the basis for cultivating the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana. This view is not an intellectual view, but is the recognition and equipoise in a moment of unfabricated consciousness, sometimes referred to as "ordinary mind" ( tha mal gyi shes pa ). Then, having stabilized the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, one is considered qualified to move onto creation and completion stage practices. Parallel to this is the pervasive practice of guru yoga, which is also predicated in the direct introduction found in major empowerments or alternately, in Dzogchen direct introductions. Here, the point is fundamentally the same, the recognition and equipoise in a moment of unfabricated consciousness. Preliminary even to these practices, in the Sakya system one is supposed to practice quite a bit of yantra yoga and prāṇāyāma before even beginning to mediate the view  of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, though this approach is seldom followed in modern times.

One important point we should not overlook is that this "ordinary mind" is really the same point being addressed in Dzogchen trekchö, the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, mahāmudra, and so on. The basis for cultivating this ordinary mind is nothing other than some kind of introduction where the teacher uses specific experiences to guide to student to encounter their own state. Such experience of introduction is absolutely crucial, because even if the student did not grasp the introduction at the time it was given, they were guided in this experience and this experience (which could be either physical bliss, clarity, or nonconceptuality) is used as the springboard for students to encounter their own state directly. Very intelligent people, like Mañjuśṛīmitra, Śṛī Simha, etc., can understand the meaning of Dzogchen merely through symbols. Knowledge about this kind of Dzogchen transmission is preserved mainly in the teachings called the Vajra Bridge, connected with the so-called "space series."

Thus, as far as I know, based on what people who have trained in Rinzai Zen in Japan for many years during the 1960's and who have also practiced in Gelug, Sakya, and Kagyu, and Nyingma, this system of direct introduction does not exist in modern Zen. But is possible their training was not very complete.

It also did not exist in the 9th century, when Nubchen Sangye Yeshe wrote his Illuminating the Eye of Samadhi ( bsam gtan mig sgron ), where he systematically goes through gradualism, sudden entry (Chan), Mahāyoga, and Dzogchen. This is why I have been saying that Chan/Zen is sutric, not because I think sūtra is bad or inferior, but because the method of entry in sūtra and tantra are quite different, and the method of entry of the latter is not found in the former. Not only do we have direct introduction in Tibetan Vajrayāna, but this system exists in the highest levels of Shingon, where I have been informed, the final abhiṣeka rite one undergoes in one's training is called the "formless abiṣeka." We also have the example our Matylda, who asserted some years ago on this forum, that in Soto Zen, at the higher levels of training in Japan, there are also Mikkyo rites which are not shared outside the inner circles of the highest ranks of Shingon priests, which she related were the highest teachings in that school. The presence of such methods in Rinzai would not surprise me in the least. But the key point here, with respect to Shingon and Soto, is that these methods are drawn from the tantras, not sūtra.

The lack of documentation of such methods in Soto and Rinzai, apart from anecdotal accounts from you and Matylda tend to confirm my teacher, Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche's opinion, which is that modern Zen has been very influenced by Vajrayāna Buddhism. He even went to so far once as to opine that he thought that Zen had been directly influenced by Dzogchen teachings. For example, we have a Tibetan Dzogchen master, Aro Yeshe Jungney, who lived at the end of the tenth century and into the 11th, who is said to have combined the teachings of Hashang Mohoyen with Dzogchen, though it is not completely certain he interacted with any Chinese teachers directly. On the other hand, even though it is claimed in late historical documents that Chan Buddhism was exiled from Tibet, the reality of it is that disciples of Chan Buddhist masters in Tibet very likely continued to practice Chan alongside Vajrayāna until Chan was really brought into disrepute in 11th century polemical writings like the Testament of Ba, which is one of the sources for the Samye Debate. And we have the Chan sayings of a few Tibetan Chan masters preserved in Nubchen's text.

However, I am pretty certain that such methods were not present in Tang Dynasty Chan prior to arrival of Esoteric Buddhism to China in the mid 8th century, at the same time Vajrayāna Buddhism was being transmitted to Tibet.

Unfortunately, in Tibetan Buddhism, empowerments and so on have become so rote and routine, teachers often do not make this point about direct introduction clear to their students, and the Gelugpas, following Sakya Pandita, even reject the system of direct introduction all together as a sufficient introduction to Vajrayāna.

So, these are the reasons why I say what I said about Chan etc., above, and I also recognize that nothing human beings do remains fixed and static, as much as we pretend that Dharma teachings are "brought down from the mountain" like the ten commandments or the Quran, never to be altered or questioned.

Is there a fault in my experience of meeting a teacher I didn’t know for a teaching I really could not contextualize... driven, by what, I really have no idea, certainly not “interest”, which requires knowledge... and practicing and studying with him for 20 years now?

Seems there are other connections to teachers beyond “interest”.

An inexplicable pull, a draw. An attraction. Just karmically being compelled, like a voice in one’s head: I need to be there, no matter what, not sure even what it is, who he is, just need to be there...

It shouldn’t be controversial that animals can create and exhaust karma.  It’s difficult to achieve the merit for a human birth in the animal realm - which implies of course that it’s possible. Higher animals demonstrate social activity, adherence to codes of behavior, in the case of elephants even something close to funerary rites.

The question is whether the offences of immediate retribution function in the same way in the animal realm.  Does vipaka function in the same way?  Do the offences have such serious consequences because in part a human should understand how serious they are - and can an animal be expected to understand that too? Can all animals?

Malcolm wrote:
Animal karma is weaker because their discrimination, memory, etc. is much weaker, and thus their ability to generate various karmas is more limited. But we are way ahead of ourselves here. These issues are not discussed until well into chapter 4.

It's like Occupy, a spontaneous demonstration turning into a long term civil disobedience thing that aims at creating something new. Will it succeed? No, I'm sure it won't, but there's a seed of something there, as well as a lot of dumbass stuff.

So like anything it's a mixed bag, I won't throw it out entirely though, utopian dreamers are needed for a better future, among other things:

Ursula K. LeGuin said:
“We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art, and very often in our art, the art of words.”

As far as the reparations thing, I'm sure there are people saying all kinds of stuff all over the CHAZ, it's probably half people just ranting. This story in particular got picked up for a reason, because it has the dual purpose of further de-legitimizing CHAZ -and- stroking racial animus.

CHAZ was a media-hyped moment of hysteria. There is not now, nor was there eve, a CHAZ.

You understand that the person in this story was lying to his gurus in order to trick them into giving him a practice that he was then likely going to use to harm sentient beings?

Cinnabar said:
I get the story.

The part I don't get is the inequality that one should not see a teacher unless one's interest in the teacher exceeds that in the teaching.

There are some similarities between Chan rhetoric and Dzogchen rhetoric. But the important difference identified by Nubchen is direct introduction.

Interesting... So you're saying that any system without direct introduction is "sutra"?

Malcolm wrote:
By definition.


SilenceMonkey said:
But the essence is in the master's instructions, and in often wordless interactions between master and disciple.

Malcolm wrote:
Thus feature does not distinguish Chan/zen as unique among common Mahayana schools. Buddhism in general is an oral tradition. Texts exist merely to supplement that oral tradition. One cannot learn Dharma from books, but of course one can learn about Buddhism from books. Dharma and Buddhism however are not the same thing.




SilenceMonkey said:
Ch'an might call this naturalness 自然 or abiding in non-abiding 住而不住... or just awareness 覺知. I don't see why there wouldn't be parallel experiences in ch'an or zen. Anyway I'm with you, the language doesn't capture subtle and wordless experience.

Malcolm wrote:
As I said, this principle is not explained in sutras. It’s not even explained clearly in Mahayoga and Anuyoga. Where Dzogchen, Zen, and the perfection of wisdom meet is in the original purity of all phenomena. But the similarities end there.

In sūtra, the nature of the mind, to use your term, is the result of the path, whether gradual or not, not the basis. In sūtra, one does not start at the nature of the mind because it is never directly introduced and no methods are provided for such an introduction.

SilenceMonkey said:
I'm not so sure that the mind's emptiness nature isn't the basis for practice. Many ch'an masters emphasize ch'an as a practice of sitting in the buddha nature. I've heard told that Ch'an masters of old were more able practice ch'an without a method or path, although these days it must be used in tandem with a method to focus the mind.

Malcolm wrote:

All the people I have met, who have done extensive Zen practice (quite a few who have gone through koan practice under Maizumi Roshi and others), agree that direct introduction as practiced in Vajrayāna does not exist in Zen. Apart from having done a weekend sit with the now-disgraced Eido Roshi when I was 16, I have no personal experience with Zen, and I am sure any Zen master would kick me out for being lazy, obstreperous, and arrogant.

Another important distinction is that in sūtra based system, there is no explanation of what is termed lhun grub, sometimes is translated as spontaneous presence, self-perfected, and so on, but these English translation do not really get at the meaning.
