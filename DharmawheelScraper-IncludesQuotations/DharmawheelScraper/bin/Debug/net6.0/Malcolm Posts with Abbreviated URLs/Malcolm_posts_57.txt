Thank you Astus, Dan, Wayfarer et al for these really useful replies. I'm glad I brought this up here.

But here's something else:

I know this will sound funny but, if the objective world is an illusion or fabrication, then how do we understand "individual minds"? In other words, "who" or "what" are you Astus, Dan, Wayfarer, Muni? You "exist" for me only in relation to my mind, which is all I know. But from your perspective, I myself am part of the illusion of the objective world. But reality is nondual. I guess the question is, how do we explain "my mind" and "your mind"? I know in the Absolute sense they cannot be found, but how does that work "on the ground"?

Malcolm wrote:
There are two kinds of "nondual" discussed in Buddhadharma; nondualism ala yogacara, the absence of an external world, aka mind-only and nondualism ala madhyamaka, i.e. that absence of existence and nonexistence. The former school argues that minds are separate continuums. Madhyamaka accepts the existence of separate continuums conventionally.

No, and this is of course is the reason most Lamas think the idea of giving deity transmissions via webcast is controversial. For example, ChNN gives what he calls "don dbang" i.e. meaning empowerments, which involve no ritual objects via webcast, but he will not give full fledged empowerments via webcasts. Garchen Rinpoche on the other hand frequently gives traditional empowerments via webcast. In my opinion, as long as one is participating in real time, then either way is not really an issue. That being said, attending in person is always better.

So on the student's side, what is necessary to receive it? Faith in the guru. This is above and beyond what the 5 senses can perceive. What kind of faith? That the guru holds the lineage for the empowerment and has summoned the deity to be present and accessible at that place and time via himself. As Malcolm said, afterwards the guru dissolves the mandala and the empowerment is over. Somebody showing up late doesn't get it even if they get bonked with all the various implements, etc.

So a Chinese soldier guarding an empowerment would not receive it. Nor would a student that had a closed mind and refused to believe that something metaphysical was occurring. And "occurring" is the operative word here. It is a window into the metaphysical, which closes at the end of the empowerment.

Malcolm wrote:
All that is necessary to receive the empowerment is one) a guru with the lineage; two) interest in the practice;  three) willing participation in the rite (as it is occurring), just as in any other kind of ordination rite.

Astus said:
I think I understand that for empowerment to happen the described procedures have to be followed, as that is the definition of what an empowerment is. Similarly to marriage that is defined in a specific way by the law, and regardless of how people live or what they do, they are not married as long as the correct procedure was not followed. However, people can do the same things both with and without a marriage certificate. That is, one can still live together and have children without marriage, while it is said that without empowerment one cannot practise Vajrayana effectively. So, the disciple must obtain something during empowerment that makes him different from the uninitiated. That is why I first of all try to analyse from the perspective of the receiver and ask the question of what is transmitted from master to student. Everything delivered through the five senses can be obtained from a recording as well. The methods of the practice and the precepts to follow can also be learnt from other sources. What makes the recipient of a correctly performed empowerment different from the one who did not receive it when they both engage in the same practice and uphold the same precepts? Is it perhaps related to the knowledge that "I have the empowerment" in the former that is missing from the latter person?

Malcolm wrote:
The difference between the former and the latter is that the former is a like a field that has been tilled, fertilized and planted; whereas the latter is like field that has not been tilled, has not been fertilized and not been planted.

A person who has received an empowerment is termed "ripened", whereas those who have not received empowerments are termed "unripened." If one has not been ripened, one is not a candidate for the liberating instructions.

And as I have written elsewhere, logic and inference are not authorities in Vajrayāna, scripture is. The Abhibodhikramopadeśa of Master Āryadeva states:
At the time of the ultimate view of secret mantra,
the direct perception by the mind and sense organs
as well as inferences are not authorities;
the profound scriptures and intimate instructions are authorities.
This being the case, the Mahāmudratilaka Tantra states:
There is no siddhi for one who lacks empowerment,
just there is no butter from churning sand.
If one pridefully expounds the tantras and agamas
without empowerment,
immediately upon death master and disciple
go to hell even if siddhi has been attained.
So, you see, for Vajrayāna the issue of proper empowerments is not really something that depends on reason and inference. It depends on scripture and intimate instructions. And understanding that intellectuals might argue with such ideas, again Aryadeva writes in the Abhibodhikramopadeśa:
In evil future times,
without relying on profound scriptures and intimate instructions,
those who prioritize the twin reasonings of validation and proofs
will each grasp their own philosophy as sublime;
satisfied with a mere hidden meaning
and without any interest in the ultimate profound view, 
again they make refutations,
destroying themselves and others.
So when it comes to Secret Mantra, the tantras are the definitive authority. Also the rites must be properly performed, as the The Great Commentary Tantra of the Mayajala states:
Akaśagarbha, you should listen!
All of the tantras like mine
endowed with nondual wisdom,
like wishfulfilling gems, wish-granting trees 
and excellent vases
are proper places for devotion.
Even one [tantra] has inconceivable power
through different methods,
yielding accomplishment in the same way.
However, there is no accomplishment with defective rituals.
This is why it is very important to understand and follow the proper ritual procedures if one is both a master of Vajrayāna as well as a student of Vajrayāna. One's very realization is at stake.

Would that qualify a Western teacher to give out pointing out instructions for Dzogchen? Or do you prefer to receive them from a 18 year old Tibetan "Tulku" who happened to have inherited such a title from his father?

Malcolm wrote:
The misconception which Astus has is the notion that an empowerment is merely communicating information received through the five senses, thus for him there is no difference between an empowerment and a recording of an empowerment, it is merely information. While it is true that information is being communicated through the five sense, that is not all that is happening, there are samadhis involved on the part of both the master and the students at the same time, there is the dependent origination which needs to be actively created between the master and the student at the same time, particularly in the lower empowerments; there are the samaya vows conferred and received and the agreement to follow them (Whatever you say boss, all that I will do....), and so on — all of the things which I have now explained exhaustively.

Astus said:
Yes, my basic assumption is that what benefits one on the path must be learnt, understood and experienced personally. So for the disciple what can have any effect for him is what he visualises during the empowerment, not what the master.

Malcolm wrote:
In this case, the master must do his job, before the disciple can do their job, and if the master has finished the empowerment and dissolved the mandala, it is too late.


Astus said:
You say it is the rite that matters, and it can be completed only when both the master and the student works together at the same time. But isn't the very point of performing the rite is to benefit the disciple? The question then is how the presence of the master and what he visualises affects the disciple. How can one enter a mandala that is mentally created by another?

Malcolm wrote:
At the most basic level, it is simply a question of procedure: in order for a master to confer an empowerment, he must first create himself in the form of that mandala or deity, as well as create a front-created mandala or deity (from which one actually receives the empowerment) before he can introduce students to that mandala in the form of a series of guided visualizations, which he does through a series of verbal instructions and visual cues, which include mantras and mudras.

If the steps  above are not taken, no empowerment will be have been conferred. That is just how it is. For example, if on an assembly line you do not assemble the parts in the proper way, your product will not work. So it is with an empowerment: if the procedures of the ritual are not carried out properly and in their correct order, the empowerment will not be valid.

If the master conferring the empowerment has not himself received the empowerment, the empowerment will not be valid. If he has not done the basic retreats, or at least received permission from his own guru to give the empowerments, the empowerment will not be valid, and the master will himself have broken his own samaya regarding revealing secrets to those who have not been ripened by empowerment (you may ask whether I am breaking samaya by discussing this — the answer is no, because I am not discussing specific details of Vajrayāna practice). If he omits parts of the ritual of the empowerment, the empowerment will not only not be valid, it will not have taken place at all.

Empowerments are very precise formula of ritual procedures which are designed to give transmissions into very specific practices in a structured way. Thus if the structure of the empowerment is violated, the transmission does not happen. Therefore, the idea that a recording of a mere part of an empowerment (the activities for disciples) can serve as an empowerment is a deeply mistaken idea on the part of anyone who holds it. Not only will there be no master conferring the empowerment; since there is no master, the conditions for the creation of the mandala/deity are absent, thus there is no mandala/deity. If there is no mandala/deity, there is nothing into which the student may be initiated. Therefore, the empowerment depends on the creation of the mandala/deity, the mandala/deity depends on the samadhi of the master, and the master's ability to confer the empowerment itself depends two things: a) he himself has received the transmission and b) he has either done the retreats for that practice or been commanded by his own guru to confer the transmission.

In addition there are ten things a master must know to be qualified to give empowerments. This can be looked up elsewhere.

No, the idea that we can reduce Sukhavati to a metaphor is actually the more modern POV.  Definitely not. The idea that buddhakṣetras, of which Sukhavati is but one, are actual physical places purified by bodhisattvas as part of their path is pervasive in Mahāyāna Buddhism.
It is common place in Chan Buddhism to interpret the Pure Land as an expedient expression for the Pure Mind; and to interpret Amitabha as our "self nature". Let me know if you need me to point to specific Chan texts. But really, even if you pick a Chan text at random, you will probably find that kind of interpretation in it, if there is a mention of Amitabha. There are some exceptions such as Hanshan Deqing perhaps, but they are the exception and not the rule in the Chan Buddhist tradition. And this is not an arbitrary method of interpretation, either, it has support in the Sutras.  In Mahayana Buddhism, the Vimalakirti Sutra advocates that “When the mind becomes pure, the Buddha land also becomes pure,” while the Avatamsaka Sutra asserts that “One should contemplate the nature of all things in the Dharmadhatu, and realize that they are all created by the mind,” and that “The mind, like a skillful painter, paints all sorts of skandhas" - so there is support for that interpretation, and then there is the Contemplation Sutra's own statement that Sukhavati is "not far away" and that "the mind creates (Amida) buddha" - So whether it is a physical place or not, it remains true that it is mind-only.

Varying levels of understanding understand different things on different levels, none of which are necessarily in contradiction. Thus, one can understand Mt.

The same applies to the buddhafields in the ten directions. They are both literal places, as conventionally real as this world system is, their purity or impurity are also functions of the purity or impurity of the mind, as is the purity or impurity of this world system and so on. So, we can have our cake and eat it too — but to maintain that Sukhavati is merely a metaphor, and not a real place, that is an extreme of denial.

First we should ask ourselves what we mean by "real". What is real? Is the keyboard in front of you real? Why? Because it's there, out there, right, how could it not be real? Then when you dream, a keyboard can appear in your dream. And again, it's out there. You can touch it, type on it. But then you wake up and the keyboard vanishes. So was the keyboard real or not? And if it wasn't, what guarantees that the keyboard you're typing on at this very moment is any more real?

Malcolm wrote:
It then follows that you grant Amitabha the same level of conventional reality you grant yourself.

No, not if you are an ordinary person. If you are an ordinary person, you must go through step by step and analyze all four extremes. Having ascertained through analysis that a phenomena existing through the four extremes does exist in the relative, one then applies that analysis to the ultimate, finding that also that there is nothing which can be found in the ultimate existing by way of the four extremes. Then, as Khenpo Ngalo states:
Likewise, the mind free from the trio of arising, ceasing and abiding, existence and nonexistence, and being and nonbeing, is naked in the emptiness free from proliferation. In one’s experience, the unceasing stream of mere clarity and mere awareness is empty at the time of being clear and clear at the time being empty — do not grasp clarity or emptiness. Rest wholly, nakedly and freely in the state that is free from extremes, without divisions, inexpressible and beyond thought. 
Finally, rest free of concepts [had de chad de] without grasping in mere inexpressibility.
This means that having completed one's analysis one simply rests in the nature of the mind as one finds it, without modifying it in anyway.

Astus said:
The Yamamoto translation says,

"Being based on Dharma means nothing other than basing oneself on the Mahaparinirvana of the Tathagata. All Buddhist teachings are none but “Dharmata” [essence of Dharma, essence of Reality]. This “Dharmata” is the Tathagata. Hence, the Tathagata is Eternal and Unchanging. Any person who says that the Tathagata is non-eternal does not know “Dharmata”."

Mark Blum's translation (p 194, BDK Edition):

"the dharma to be taken as one's refuge is none other than this mahaparinirvana of the Tathagata. As the dharma of all buddhas, it is the dharmata, the nature of reality. And as the dharmata, it is what the Tathagata is. This is why the Tathagata is a permanently abiding presence without change. If someone were to say that the Tathagata is impermanent, that person would not understand, he has not seen the nature of reality."

Here's my simple version from the same 40-fascicle Dharmaksema translation (T12n374, p401c3-5):

依法者。即是如來大般涅槃。一切佛法即是法性。是法性者即是如來。是故如來常住不變。若復有言如來無常。是人不知不見法性。

Relying on the Law is [relying on] the Thus Come One's Great Parinirvana. All Buddha Laws are the Law-nature, the Law-nature is the Thus Come One, so the Thus Come One is eternal and permanent. If it were said that the Thus Come One is impermanent, that person would not know and would not see the Law-nature.

But to further clarify this section, a little later the sutra says:

Yamamoto:
"Basing oneself upon Dharma means basing oneself upon “Dharmata”; not basing oneself on man refers to the sravaka. “Dharmata” is the Tathagata, and the sravaka is the created. The Tathagata is Eternal, but the sravaka is non-eternal."

Blum:
"The dharma to take refuge in is the reality of dharmata; the person not to take refuge in is a sravaka disciple. The reality of dharmata is a tathagata; a sravaka disciple is a created phenomenon. A tathagata is permanently abiding; a created phenomenon is impermanent."

So, it is not really discussing differences between teachings, it turns it into the difference between unconditioned and conditioned. Same happens with the other three seals.

Malcolm wrote:
In reality, the passage you citing is referring to reliance on the Dharma (among the four reliances). It says in full in the Sanskrit -- > Chinese -- > Tibetan translation:
"Relying on the Dharma" is the parinirvana of the Tathāgata. The Dharma of the Buddha is the dharmatā of Dharmas. So-called "dharmatā" is the Tathagāta. That being so, the Tathāgata is permanent and unchanging. Any person who says the Tathāgata is impermanent, that person has not seen nor known dharmatā
The Tibetan translation direct from Sanskrit however however reads a little more clearly:
Dharmatā is the parinirvana of the Tathāgata. The Tathāgata is permanent, stable, and eternal. This is the dharmatā of all the Buddhas. Whoever sees the Tathāgata as impermanent, they do not know dharmatā."
So it is not really clear that the Nirvana Sūtra makes the bold declaration that dharmatā = tathāgata. It seems that the sutra is actually saying that the permanence, stability and eternity is the dharmatā, or real nature, of all buddhas. That is a much different message than the one you want to present. In fact, I would just say that the Chinese translation upon which you are relying is embellished and somewhat inaccurate and whenever someone reads something in it, they need to check it against the Tibetan translation direct from Sanskrit.

I dont think so.

Anyway, the term translated into Tibetan through the Chinese as sangs rgyas kyi rang bzhin, buddhanature, seems to be a Chinese gloss on the Sanskrit term buddhadhātu. Perhaps the buddhadhatu (sangs rgyas kyi kham) morphed into buddhanature because of the Sanskrit --> Chinese --> Tibetan route of the expanded version. The term buddhaprakṛti, buddhanature does not seem to be an attested Indian term. I am not going to say one hundred percent it does not exist, but if it does, it is rare and does not carry the meaning we normally associate it with in English. The term buddhadhatu, however does exist in the Indian text.

The term sangs rgyas kyi rang bzhin appears a total of 679 times, 176 times in the first volume, the rest in the second of the Chinese to Tibetan version.

In the Sanskrit to Tibetan version, the term tathāgatagarbha shows up 69 times; where as in the Chinese version it shows up 32 times, but only in the first volume, it is absent from the second volume entirely. Buddhadhātu shows up 20 times.

As for your question, as above, the Indian version states:
Son of a good family, bodhisattvas of the tenth stage can seen only a general approximation of the tathagātagarbha that exists in their bodies.

A conceptual mind can never produce a nonconceptual mind — it is impossible. The mind (sems) is always with concepts (rnam par rtog pa).

The path of seeing arises from a cessation of concepts about the four extremes. To paraphrase Shantideva:

Good luck with trying to develop a non-conceptual realisation of emptiness without a conceptual experience - you'll be the first person in the history of Buddhist practice who has been able to do it.

Malcolm wrote:
You are not understanding the point — an inference cannot turn into a direct perception. All an inference will allow you to do is recognize something you have not seen before.

But even here, since the realization of emptiness at the first bhumi is nonconceptual, when you are realizing it, are you aware of it during the path of seeing? Or is it something you post-facto conceptually recognize that you have experienced? If it is as in the first case, then how is the first bhumi nonconceptual? And if it is the second case, then there is a missing link in your account, because we all clearly agree as long as one has not attained the Mahāyāna path of seeing, our notion of emptiness is strictly a conceptual inference.

It is for this reason there is a big debate which approach to emptiness one takes: the generic approach to emptiness of all three vehicles, the emptiness of inherent existence, or the special emptiness of Mahāyāna, the freedom from all four extremes (which alone can produce the Mahāyāna path of seeing). Apart from the Gelugpas, all Madhyamaka approaches, including Nāgārjuna's clearly underline the need to negate all four extremes in the ultimate, not merely one.

This has direct bearing on the mind of a Buddha. The mind of a Buddha cannot have concepts because the mind of a Buddha is never separate from state of equipoise on reality — a Buddha is in equipoise 24/7/365. The mind of a buddha is a nonconceptual stream of clarity and emptiness that is unsullied by any remaining obscurations. A Buddha response to the wishes of sentient beings spontaneously, like a wishfulfilling gem, without any intention or thought at all.

With respect to the last it is based completely on the samadhi of the master conferring the empowerment, whereas the other two are supports for the samadhi of the master, but primarily as a aid to students of lesser capacity. Whichever the case may be, the mandala is in any case created and then dissolved at the end of the rite. After that it is up to the students to do the daily practice themselves.

So for example, the Vajrakilaya empowerment you attended with HHST has been dissolved — it no longer exists in that space, in that place. The minute HHST was done with the rites of conferring the empowerments, he began to finish the Ganapuja (empowerments are actually a branch of ganapuja activities), offer tormas and in the end he dismissed the wisdom beings in the front created mandala and the vase mandala and dissolved his self-creation thus ending the rite completely apart from the dedication of merits, aspirations and benedictory prayers.

The only sense in which we can say that mandala continues is in the mandala of students who attended the empowerment. But until you yourself do the retreats, and so on, you cannot give that empowerment to someone else. That mandala does not exist on the video as a living entity. It cannot practice the sadhana, it also cannot grant empowerment, etc.

The misconception which Astus has is the notion that an empowerment is merely communicating information received through the five senses, thus for him there is no difference between an empowerment and a recording of an empowerment, it is merely information. While it is true that information is being communicated through the five sense, that is not all that is happening, there are samadhis involved on the part of both the master and the students at the same time, there is the dependent origination which needs to be actively created between the master and the student at the same time, particularly in the lower empowerments; there are the samaya vows conferred and received and the agreement to follow them (Whatever you say boss, all that I will do....), and so on — all of the things which I have now explained exhaustively.

Frankly — and no disrespect intended towards Garchen Rinpoche — it does not really matter what his answer is.

For example, let us say some one claims "Oh, there is God in Buddhadharma, I heard my guru say so" and even goes so far as to find a quote where this or that  guru says there is God in Buddhism. This does not mean that this is correct, or that there is fact the doctrine of God in Buddhadharma, or that we need to take that statement literally.

Let us say for example, that someone claims "My guru says that there is no rebirth and no karma in Buddhism" and even goes so far as to find a quote where this or that guru says there is there is no rebirth and no karma in Buddhadharma. This does not mean that this is correct, or that there is fact no doctrine of rebirth and karma in Buddhadharma.

This is why, in the end, even what one's guru says must be subjected to scrutiny, it must be measured against what is taught in the tantra and the authoritative opinions of masters of the past. If someone who one regards as a guru teaches something that does not correspond with Buddhadharma, one must ignore those statements.  Since we subject all the Buddha's words to scrutiny, why should we not do the same with respect to what our gurus say? Why should we abandon our critical thinking merely because we think our guru is a Buddha? We should not.

In particular, when confronted with novelties such as the assertion that people can receive empowerments from recordings of past empowerments, people must use common sense in addition to reason. Who is making this claim? Why is this claim being made?, and so on.

Even the recording contains all activities that the guru has done or prepared, the actual mandala has gone by the time when students watch or hear it. Unless whenever you watch or listen to the recording, the mandala re-generated, but that doesn't make sense. Live-stream empowerment is different: if the guru includes certain students in the mandala with his visualisation, no matter the student is sitting in the Gompa, outside of Gompa, another building or another country, there is a actual mandala AT THAT TIME so it is possible. In non-real-time case, even the guru visualise the uncertain students all in the current mandala, there still won't be that mandala at the time when those people hear it; when there was a mandala and the guru visualised them in, those people do not aware anything thus could not create any link. So it is illogical, not just against the text, for any empowerment that needs a mandala or object to be given with non-real-time recording.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct.

However, it is totally possible that whenever a student watch a video or hear an audio of empowerment from a truly great master, if he or she generates genuine faith, the master and deity will appear in front of him or her to grant blessing.

Not only that, but the recording generally only covers the activities for the disciple. All the activities that the master has to do before conferring the empowerment are not recorded.
Thus the recording is incapable of doing recreating these things since a recording has no mind, no volition and so on.

Astus said:
What the master visualises and does before the empowerment does not show for the receiver either when he is present phyiscally or when it is through a live broadcast. How is it any different for the person watching a recording? Whether the master followed the prescribed procedure to give the empowerment or not, it cannot be known by the receiver. Whatever is received by the disciple exists only as physical sensory perception, so anything beyond that does not have any role in receiving the empowerment. But if you say it does, then what and how?

Malcolm wrote:
That is not the point. The point is whether the rite is complete or not with all its parts.

A master does a sadhana, creates a mandala, invites the students into that mandala and closes the mandala.

If the master does not do the sadhana before hand, creating the mandala, even if he reads the portion of the initiation text meant create the students as the mandala, it won't happen. The master must be visualizing himself as that specific deity for which he is giving the empowerment having already properly performed the sadhana himself, before he can give the empowerment. Likewise, during the empowerment, the master must visualize all the students in the form the deity, he must summon the wisdom continuum of that deity to merge with the visualized form of the students he has visualized as the deity, make it firm, and then bestow the various blessings of body speech and mind will maintaining all of this visualization continuously. Also the student from their side must try their best to follow and do the described visualizations at the same time the master is doing them.

Finally, and importantly, at the end of the ritual the master dissolves the mandala completely. Once he finishes his sadhana, the mandala has been dissolved. One cannot receive empowerment into a mandala that has been dissolved, just as one cannot enter a house that has been constructed and then dismantled.

For example, while one can watch a video of a house being constructed and dismantled, one will never be able to enter that house at any time while one is watching the recording. If one the other hand you are there for the raising of the structure, you can enter the structure until it has been dismantled. Likewise, in terms of receiving an initiations, if you are present for the master's creation of the students as the mandala, then you can enter that mandala, but if you are not present in real time, then it does not work. Why? Because the master and the student have to be engaged at the same time in the process of the giving and receiving the empowerment, they have to be in the mandala together. This is impossible with a recording.

What assumes a type of mental connection that is bound by time?

Astus said:
That the mental state of the person giving the empowerment influences the receiver's mind, as if there were a direct connection between two mind-streams.

Malcolm wrote:
No, that is never the case, it is more like a stamp and its impression. A recorded empowerment can never be a stamp, it can only be an impression. In this case, an inert impression. A student, who receives an empowerment, is an animate living person upon whom an impression has been made, and when they have realized the meaning, they too can make impressions on others.

This is essentially why, for all who reading, the idea that one can receive an empowerment from a recording is a corrupt idea that will destroy lineages if people take it seriously.

Malcolm, I think I'm just as right wing/hardcore about this subject as you are, but I disagree with your approach. You can't leave people at the bottom of a cliff and say that there is a door to Dharma at the top of the cliff. You've got to give them a way to get there. Simply abandoning them like that could very well be breaking the bodhisattva vow.

You cannot be a Dharma practitioner and yet reject rebirth. Do we really have to have this conversation yet again?
I doubt that someone like Trungpa rejected rebirth in his own practice, yet he did not make a huge issue out it with his students. If so, then how he chose to guide his students towards Dharma is limited only by his own realization and upaya/skill. Thus there is room for acceptance or rejection of what he did, but based only on how one sees his attainments, not on how much latitude a realized teacher has on guiding their students towards Dharma.

For me, he was not my teacher, so I feel no need to formulate an opinion about whether he was realized enough to use his discretion to adapt things the way he did. But I acknowledge that there is room for that type of thing within the tradition--if needed and by a fully realized teacher.
You do realize that he participated in Dagara initiations with an African teacher named Malidoma Patrice Somé?
He is very open minded, maybe too much so. He has not limited his open-mindedness to the teachings coming from Tibet. That may or may not be a good thing. Personally I leave my comfort Zone at the edges of the Vajrayana.

If you look around, you will discover that Malidoma Patrice Somé is fervent advocate of sacrificing animals. I can't say that this was part of Ray's initiation (though I would be surprised if it was not). We all know how the Buddha felt about animal sacrifice.

The whole belief in past lives is something that Buddhism inherited from Indian Tradition.

And if it doesn’t make sense, dump it, get rid of it.” And I think that incarnation, ah… reincarnation, as a literal teaching, I don’t find it helpful for anybody because it takes your focus away from this life. But if incarnation is viewed as a sort of metaphor for the fact that we humans are on some kind of extremely long spiritual journey that happened before we were born, and it’s going to keep on going, then I think it’s helpful.”

But, one cannot self-ordain as a novice, or a monk, nor can one confer upon oneself any empowerment.

In general one should receive the three vows from a master and then enhance them by renewing them daily. Unless of course you are a very high Dzogchen practitioner like so many people we see on Buddhist internet boards who have transcended the need for mundane things such as paying attention to the state of their vows.

From my non-Vajrayana perspective I can easily see how in some instance face-to-faces interaction with a teacher who knows your heart is indispensable, but a lot of other instruction can be received in various formats. What mechanism in empowerments makes it work when it is live and fail when it isn't?

Buddhas' minds are non-conceptual but they do possess the five all-accompanying mental factors as this is the valid basis upon which mind is imputed. They have omniscience and therefore they also possess the object ascertaining mental factors.


Malcolm wrote:
and what is your citation for this?

Tsongkhapafan said:
You know I can't give my citations because of the TOS, however, I will quote Dharmakirti's definition of mind which is 'that which is clarity and cognising'. Buddhas have minds, minds cognise, cognition requires mental factors, ergo, Buddhas have minds with mental factors. Bliss for example is experienced by mental factor feeling.

Buddha are not like stones.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course you can give your citations. But I meant from Sutra.

When one says that a Buddha has jñan̄a, but not vijñāna, this does not mean a Buddha is inert, it means the opposite.

Cognition for an ordinary sentient being requires mental factors, but a Buddha's jñāna does not require mental factors.

For example there is a sutra passage cited in the Yogācārabhūmi viniścayasaṃgrahanī that states:
"Bhagavān, how should the mental factors of the tathāgatas be known?"

"Mañjuśrī, the mind (citta, sems), intellect (yid, manas) or consciousness (vijñāna, rnam shes) of tathāgatas are indeed not differentiated in discerning wisdom, but the mind of a tathāgata arises without formations, and should known to be like an emanation."

"Bhagavān, it being the case the dharmakāya of the tathāgatas is free from all action of formations, on the other hand, do mental factors arise without the action of formations?"

"Mañjuśrī, it is due to past cultivation of method and wisdom.

Mañjuśrī, one awakens [from sleep] because of the power of past formations, but though there are no formations for arising in the concentration on cessation, one arises [from concentration] only through the power of past formations. Just as like the mental factors of sleep and the concentration on cessation, the mental factors of the tathāgatas should be known to be formations of past cultivation of method and wisdom."

"Bhagavān, do the emanations of the tathāgatas have minds or not?"

"Mañjuśrī, Though they do not have minds, they are also not mindless, because minds are neither independent nor dependent."
In other words, the mind of a tathāgata is like an emanation, it appears to function in all the ways that a mind functions, but in reality, there are no present active formations happening. Everything that seems to happen in the mind of a Buddha is based on some past cultivation of method and wisdom on the path.

So Buddhas seem to have minds, but in reality, all they have is wisdom.

Malcolm wrote:
In Vajrayāna there is no such thing as modernism. There is the lineage, and how the lineage presents the teachings. The lineage is unalterable and without a lineage there is no Vajrayāna to speak of.

Zen, for example, is a sūtrayāna teaching, and this while there is rhetoric about the lineage of patriarchs, ancient buddhas and so on, there is not a universally held idea that the lineage is something inviolable or absolutely necessary. Plenty of people practice Zen without the kind of guru devotion that characterizes Vajrayāna. Also these days many people practice Zen who really do not believe that Zen was actually passed down in a lineage from the time of the Buddha. There is more room for so-called "modernism" in Zen.

But in Vajrayāna, the Vajrayāna teachings are held to come directly from Buddha Vajradhara to our gurus. There is truly little point in trying to practice Vajrayāna if you don't believe this. The second thing is that one should have faith that one's root guru is actually a Buddha, or at least one should try to develop that sincere conviction over time. If one does not have this conviction, it is very difficult to make progress in Vajrayāna practice; but if one has this conviction, it becomes very easy.

Since there is no way to modernize this essential feature of Vajrayāna, Vajrayāna will always resist modernization.

For example, there is a well known story about how Naropa displayed a mandala in the sky to Marpa, and asked Marpa to whom he would prostrate, the guru or the mandala, Marpa, thinking that he saw his guru everyday, but never saw such miraculously manifested mandalas, chose to prostrate to the mandala...big mistake that cost Marpa his family lineage...

So, Mahamudra in the modern world is an impossibility, if by that one means, how can Mahamudra be adapted to fit modern society — it can't, we can only adapt ourselves to Mahāmudra, mahāmudra cannot be adapted to suit us.

Tilopa (Prajñābhadra) was a Nalanda educated Pandita, as was Naropa. Marpa was a faithful student of Naropa, and Mila was his student in turn.

None of these masters innovated a thing.

Not only this, but Tilopa and Naropa are not just a "Kagyu" masters, though these days people certainly seem to have this misconception. They are shared also with Sakya, Gelug and old Kadampa, etc.

I have been reading book "Kagyu/gelug tradition of mahamudra" from here and there and there is one thing that I find difficult to understand. The mahamudra practices that are given in the root text ( The main road of triupmhant ones ) contain two mahamudra methods, sutra and tantra. However nowhere in the text or in the related commentary  there is anything said about receiving "pointing -out" instructions. Kagyu traditions have sutra mahamudra and there is a lot of talk about receving pointing out instruction from qualified teacher.
But nothing is said about receiving pointing-out  instructions in context of Gaden mahamudra practice. Why is this?  Are they unnecessary here? I thought these are neccesary in sutra mahamudra practice.


Malcolm wrote:
The text is the pointing out instruction. It is not a direct introduction like what you receive in Dzogchen. Nor is it an introduction such as you receive in the four empowerments. Of course the fact that the text says:

Meditate next on a profound path of guru-yoga and, after making hundreds of very strong, fervent requests, dissolve your visualized guru into yourself.

This automatically means you must be someone who has received niruttarayoga tantra empowerment. There is no guru without a such an empowerment, so how can one speak of guru yoga? Guru Yoga is a method exclusive to higher tantra, the name of which is not encountered in lower tantra much less sūtra.

Guru Yoga can produce a wisdom that resembles the wisdom produced by the two stages, indeed, but really, this is only for the people of highest capacity or who have developed their capacity through much practice. And of course, to be qualified to practice guru yoga, one should have received all four empowerments in a proper way.

Sadhana practice is indeed for those who do not manage to attain buddhahood during the empowerment. People misunderstand empowerments, thinking they are merely a method of introducing this or that practice. Actually, empowerments are meant to cause people to attain buddhahood; failing that, they practice sadhanas with the two stages and guru yoga.

The reality of it is however that very few people in history have attained buddhahood during an empowerment, or even the bhumis.

Malcolm wrote:
The point is that the cause empowerment tills the field which makes the student a proper basis. The idea all the previous Varjayāna trainingand practice that Naropa had undergone had no bearing on his time with Tilopa is simply ludicrous. For example, Amyezhab records in his history of Cakrasamvara, that following his meeting with the old lady who had eighteen characteristics of ugliness, since Naropa doubted whether she was a dakini or not, he did an accomplishment retreat of seven hundred thousand near essence mantras of Cakrasamvara to confirm this. Thus, the idea that Naropa was not a very advanced Varjayāna practitioner when he met Tilopa really is not correct nor is the idea that his previous practice had not prepared him for his time with Tilopa. Also Tilopa aka Prajñabhadra, realized Mahāmudra through the two stages of Cakrasamvara having received it from his guru, Antarapa.

Yes, I am aware that there is a Kagyu tradition that Tilopa was an emanation which is found in Gampopa's brief bio.

Is that HYT?

Can we classify the result as Mahamudra?

Malcolm wrote:
Lamdre speaks about a basis, a path and a result.

The basis is the ālaya cause continuum — this is exactly the same thing Kagyus call "ground mahāmudra." It is nothing more nor less than the nature of the mind.

In Lamdre, when ālaya, aka the inseparability of clarity and emptiness, is approached via sūtra methods in the Triple Vision teachings, one meditates upon it via śamatha and vipaśyāna.  In the beginning, in terms of śamatha, one uses an external object, a blue flower, then a blue cloth or the sky and finally, one focuses inwardly on the naked clarity of the mind itself. In terms of the vipaśyāna, one establishes that the appearances are mind, the mind is illusory and dependently arisen, and finally that dependent arising is natureless and free from all extremes. When one is capable of resting in the naked clarity of the mind in conjunction with the insight that this clarity is empty and free from extremes, this is called the union of śamatha and vipaśyāna. However, this is merely a sutrayāna meditation and will not lead to Buddhahood in a single lifetime no matter how good a meditation it may be. As the Nalendra Khenpo, Ngawang Lodo states in his Lamp of the Path of Freedom and Omniscience:
In one’s experience, the unceasing stream of mere clarity and mere awareness is empty at the time of being clear and clear at the time being empty — do not grasp clarity or emptiness. Rest wholly, nakedly and freely in the state that is free from extremes, without divisions, inexpressible and beyond thought.
But this is not the state of mahāmudra nor is it the realization of mahāmudra.

The special view of Lamdre is called the inseparability of samsara and nirvana. This view can only be meditated upon after one has received the cause Hevajra empowerment. It is meditated upon prior to engaging in the meditations of the creation and completion stage. The way this is meditated is through thirty-two examples which establish phenomena as mind, mind as an illusion and illusion as natureless. Not only this but there is an inseparability of samsara and nirvana of the path and also an inseparability of samsara and nirvana of the result.

Then there is the path method continuum, which is equivalent to so called "path mahāmudra" in the Kagyu system. This refers to the practice of the creation and completion stages.

Finally, there is the result mahāmudra continuum. This refers to the buddhahood that is the result of the two stages. This is equivalent to the result mahāmudra in the Kagyu system.

Now, it may be wondered, "Are these three continuums the same or are they different?" These three continuums are merely names for phases of a single continuum, much like the way Maitreyanath distinguishes between sentient beings, bodhisattvas and buddhas by labeling them respectively impure, pure/impure and pure. And as Jetsun Rinpoche points, the natural perfection of the qualities of buddhahood in the all-basis cause continuum or so called ground mahāmudra does not contradict transformation.

So you see it is not simply enough to realize the nature of the mind and call that "mahāmudra." In order to achieve a result, a path is called for. The only way to extract the butter of mahāmudra is to take the milk of the nature of the mind and churn it with the two stages. Other than that, there is no way to realize mahāmudra.

Pardon me if I missed it, but I don't think anybody mentioned what Situ Panchen says about the situation.

On the point of whether there is a paramitayana mahamudra, he says there are two positions on it from 'our tradition' and neither one is official.  The first is that the sutra system is for those who are not suitable to receive empowerments (for whatever reason) and so, by practicing paramitayana, it would prepare them to receive empowerments later on.  This is nevertheless called 'sutra mahamudra'.  Apart from the name, this is unobjectionable.

The second view is that the wisdom of paramitayana is itself the same as mahamudra. This is the controversial one since it destroys the distinction of paramitayana and mantrayana.  Go Lotsawa is a good example of of someone who asserted the second view, saying that Gampopa was able to produce mahamudra in people who had not attained empowerments and he provides a couple of scriptural citations to defend against Sapan's criticism.

Situ Panchen does not say whether he think Gampopa held either position but allows for both.

Situ Panchen also points out, perhaps more importantly, that 'empowerment' does not simply mean going through a ritual of some kind, but is essentially the guru's blessing of the transference of wisdom (ye shes pho ba'i byin labs).  In this respect, the fourth initiation, that of mahamudra, can occur outside of what is normally understand by the term 'empowerment', i.e. a ceremony involving the four initiations, and indeed Tilopa's initiation of Naropa is an example of this kind of empowerment.  Equally, one can sit through any number of elaborate ceremonies, but not have received empowerment, e.g. like a cat or dog.  Sapan's claims about mahamudra and empowerment seem to overlook this detail.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course this ignores the important point that Naropa was already a Vajrayāna practitioner by the time he met Tilopa. As to your second claim, this is only possible if you sit there like a stone, and or refuse to participate at all, having something like a picnic instead, watching the ritual like a baseball game or as a form of entertainment, the way some non-Buddhist Westerners these days attend Kalacakra empowerments.

Go Lotsawa's opinion is noted, but it is just that, an opinion by a scholar who lived many centuries after Gampopa.

What we do have are examples of mahāsiddhas, very many in fact, who attained awakening and realized mahāmudra during the process of receiving the four empowerments. We have many other examples of mahāsiddhas who, having received the four empowerments, practiced the two stages and swiftly realized mahāmudra and so attained buddhahood. We have no examples of any Indian mahāsiddhas who did either based on a mere conversation, or through merely practicing śamtha and vipaśyāna, whether sprinkled with pithy saying from the dohas or not.

So I guess, Tibetans must have much higher capacity than Indians, because according to you, these vaunted Tibetans are capable of realizing Mahāmudra based on sutrayāna conversations, sprinkled with dohas, merely practicing śamatha and vipaśyāna. But the reality is, no one realized mahāmudra without practicing the two stages, including Gampopa.

Astus said:
Also, the fourth empowerment is generally equated with the pointing out instruction

Malcolm wrote:
Which pointing out instruction? Whose? What precise text? If you intend the means of pointing the "sūtra" mahāmudra system, for example, in Bokar Rinpoche's famous condensation of the 7th Karmapa's long Mahāmudra text, this is in no way shape or form equivalent with the fourth empowerment.


Astus said:
As above, the specialty of Gampopa's Mahamudra is the direct introduction without empowerment.

Malcolm wrote:
It is not a direct introduction, it is a gradual introduction, that takes many sessions, like all sutra-based systems. You yourself admitted that Gampopa's "mahāmudra" was "sutra" mahāmudra.

Now, when it comes to essence mahāmudra, there is an empowerment (the descent of the wisdom vajra empowerment) based in Indrabhuti's famous text, the Jñānasiddhi, and this is in fact a direct introduction, just like the fourth empowerment.

All I can conclude from this discussion, Astus, is that you are not really very clear on the difference between "pointing out instructions", which is gradual,  and "direct introduction," which is immediate.

Further, what you seem to fail to understand is that in actual practice, in general the Kagyus all practice creation and completion stage, combine the four yogas of mahāmudra with the completion stage, and practice the main practice of essence mahāmudra, Guru Yoga.

I'm not at all interested in finding a lama, becoming a disciple in the Vajrayana tradition, etc. As I said, I'm coming from a Chan/Zen background and am merely interested in learning "about" Mahamudra as a sort of comparative activity and "enhancement" to my Zen meditation. My ideas about Mahamudra were essentially informed by various comments I have seen from Zen practitioners and teachers to the effect that Mahamudra is sort of like "Tibetan Zen" and is worth "looking into". Taigen Dan Leighton, for example, in his introduction to his translation of Master Honzhi, notes what he perceives to be the great similarities between Silent Illumination meditation and Mahamudra. Others have recommended various Mahamudra books as useful ways of looking at Zen from a different angle that is essentially the same. Now this is what I've been hearing. As to whether Mahamudra and Zen are really the same in essence is something that I'm not qualifies to answer with any authority, though to be honest, based on several descriptions of Mahamudra that I have read, I really can't see much difference. I know that Tantric practitioners will squirm at such a statement, and it may open up a whole 'nother can of worms, but that's my honest impression. As for empowerments, etc, as a non-Vajrayana practitioner I can't say I'm at all convinced by the assumption that the highest enlightenment isn't possible without 'em, based on Sutra methods alone. I have nothing against Tantra, but I won't buy into the polemic that it offers some sort of enlightenment that isn't available to someone who just follows the Diamond Sutra, etc.

That is interesting, but it does not change the basic facts. Kagyus in general tend to rely on three authors to argue their claim that there can be a mahāmudra that does not depend Secret Mantra methods, but when you actually examine the texts of what those three authors say — Vajrayāna practitioners writing about Madhyamaka — it is a very slim and contrived argument.  And of course Sapan addresses this issue as well. And BTW, this idea is not universally embraced by all Kagyus. For example, the Drikungpas do not really take this approach to mahāmudra at all.

Most Kagyupas, in fact, recognize Gampopa as an innovator.  All the Kagyu Lamas I've talked with, about this issue, will readily admit this. With pride.

Greetings friends.
A question: while it goes without saying that having a teacher is always best, is it possible to study and practice Mahamudra on one's own, at least until such a time as a teacher can be found? Is it a discipline which requires empowerments, etc.? If it is possible to practice without a teacher, what are some helpful resources available online?

Any insight on this will be most appreciated.
Here's the OP's question again.

I intuit the answer here is something like "sure, you can practice Shamatha , but hey, find a teacher".

I don't think (correct me if i'm wrong) the OP really had in mind whether or not he could achieve Mahamudra, or receive blessings in Vajrayana sense by practicing some techniques from Barth's manual or similar. I had to study Vajrayana writings, get empowerments, and ask lots of questions for a year before I even could properly contextualize what "Mahamudra" even means..still not even sure I get some of the nuances behind how the term is used. I believed in the beginning it was simply a type of meditation - and I am assuming that this is how the OP is framing it, since he is not a Vajrayana practitioner.

So it begs the question, what (if any) usefulness could be gleaned from that kind of practice without a teacher? Further, since some of those techniques (following breath, just sitting etc.) have equivalents in other (sutra) Buddhist traditions, and are certainly publicly taught to those without initiation, bot within Vajrayana and outside of it, why would this be different than practicing those?

Basically, to move the thread along...should he not practice at all if he's not going to find a teacher? That is what it sounds like people are saying in places, if that isn't what people are saying, then can the message be clarified for the sake of the thread?

Malcolm wrote:
The answer is no, it is not possible to study and practice Mahāmudra on one's own. Hell, not even the Dharma in general can be practiced without a teacher. Studied, yes; practiced, no.

Astus said:
The difference between sutra and tantra in terms of Mahamudra are quite practical: "According to Mahamudra teachers, the sutric Mahayana approach uses external phenomena as the object of vipashyana meditation, whereas the tantric Mahayana approach of Mahamudra uses the mind itself as the object." ( Traleg Kyabgon ).

Malcolm wrote:
How is that possible? Have these teachers never heard of Yogacara? And even here, why make a distinction between the tantric Mahāmudra approach and the sūtra Mahāyāna approach if in reality they are both "mahāmudra"?



Astus said:
Also,

"Gampopa said that there are three different paths with different practices, but these three paths have the same nature. These are taking inference as the path, taking blessings as the path, and taking direct experience as the path. Taking inference as the path refers to, for instance, the various reasonings set forth in the Madhyamaka that show that all things are neither single nor multiple. Taking blessings as the path refers to, for instance, meditation upon the body of a deity or the practices involving the subtle channels and subtle energies. Taking direct perception as the path is mahamudra. Mahamudra is pointed out to us, and we recognize it, become accustomed to it, and take direct experience as the path.
We can also classify the different paths into three groups: the paths that abandon the ground, paths that transform the ground, and paths that recognize· the ground.The first path of abandoning the ground is the vehicle of transcendent action of the sutra vehicle, in which some things are abandoned and others are remedies for those things to be abandoned. The second path, transformation of the ground, refers to the practices of the Vajrayana in which we purity our body and mind by meditating on our body being a deity. Our body is thus transformed into the pure body of the deity, and our mind is transformed from discursiveness into wisdom. In the third path, recognizing the ground, is mahamudra.We know that we do not need to abandon or transform the ground; rather, we know it as it is. When we know the ground as it is, we recognize all appearances as the magical display of the mind. Thus, mahamudra is a matter of using direct perception as the path. This is also called the quick path."
(Thrangu: Essentials of Mahamudra, p 78-79)

Malcolm wrote:
Drogmi Lotsawa states that the difference between sūtra and tantra is that tantra uses direct perception as the path. This direct perception is the basis of all Secret Mantra meditation and is the experiential view introduced in the very beginning during the empowerment, this is why Secret Mantra is a quick path. But there is no separate means of introducing this experiential view outside of the empowerment, there is no mahāmudra that exists outside of Vajrayāna.


Astus said:
As for the so called Sutra Mahamudra (that actually stands for Gampopa's Mahamudra):

"The meditation of Sutra Mahamudra essentially consists of resting one's mind, free of mental activity, in the state of nonconceptual wisdom. This is the fundamental definition of Sutra Mahamudra: mind resting in the state in which it experiences the dharmadhatu, which is the expanse or nature of all things. This resting is essentially a nonconceptual wisdom beyond all elaboration, or the unity of clarity and emptiness. In this context, one meditates in the following way: The object of one's meditation is luminosity free of any projections; the perceiving subject is the lack of mental engagement; and one meditates without mental engagement. There are many extensive explanations on meditating without mental engagement, found primarily in the teachings of Maitripa and Sahajavajra.
The Sutrayana approach to Mahamudra is seen as a very profound method because it does not require any of the sophisticated and complex tantric rituals, deity yoga visualization practices, or samayas. It is a simple sutra approach, yet it conveys the direct transmission of the tantric essence of awakening."

Dzogchen absolutely relies on empowerment, which is why it is considered part of Secret Mantra. This why The Mind Mirror Tantra states:
Where will there be accomplishment without relying on the empowerments of secret mantra? For example, it is like a boatman without a paddle, how will one be able to cross to the other side? If the empowerments are fully obtained, all secret mantras not accomplished will be accomplished.

Quoting from "When the Clouds Part," Brunnholzl, who quotes from Kongtrul's Treasury of Knowledge:
...In the Tatvavatara composed by the master Jnanakirti, it says: "Another name of mother Prajnaparamita is Mahamudra because it is the very nature of nondual wisdom."   Thus, (Kongtrul) not only explains that the prajnaparamita taught in the sutras and the Mahamudra of mantra are synonyms, but he also explains these conventional terms:"As for those of highest capacities among the persons who exert themselves in the paramitas, when they perform the meditations of calm abiding and superior insight, even at the stage of ordinary beings, this grants them the true realization characterized by having it's origin in Mahamudra."
Kongtrul also goes on to note that important sources of this tradition came from the Kadampa lineage, in particular Atisha's "Pith Instructions on the Two Armors of Connate Union Mahamudra." Brunnholzl also notes Karmapa Mikyo Dorje's statement that this system of guidance is based on Atisha's Bodhipathapradipa.  However, Mikyo Dorje says:"Nevertheless, in the approach of practice of most heart sons (of Gampopa), the instructions in Mahamudra are taught in such a way that they are preceded by conferring an empowerment.  Thus, they hold (Mahamudra) to be the approach that is common to sutra and tantra."

This can be found in Brunnholzl's text, beginning on p. 155.  He continues the discussion about Sutra sources.

Malcolm wrote:
This is akin to saying, "Vajravārāhī is another name for Prajñāpāramitā, therefore, I can practice Vajravārāhī without empowerment and I will achieve exactly the same result whether I have the empowerment or not." So are you willing to accept the consequence? If not, then you have to explain the difference between mahāmudra and Vajravārāhī. Why can't there be a "sūtra" Vajravārāhī" if there can be a "sutra mahāmudra?"

conebeckham said:
Brunnholzl also refers to Sahajavajra's Tattvadasakatika as a source for the blending of Sutra and Mantra.   And of course Maitripa's tradition of "Amanasikara" is seen as the core of Kagyu Mahamudra. Sahajavajra's position is that the "Sutra approach adorned with pith instructions" is inferior to the Secret Mantra approach, but superior to a "straight paramita" approach.

Malcolm wrote:
Right, as I said KB just rehashes Dieter-Matthis' book.

If the view and the conduct are identical, how could the result be different because of the empowerments/guru yoga? Although, as above, all the empowerments and guru yoga are included in resting in the natural state, at least according to certain Mahamudra teachers.

Malcolm wrote:
The intellectual view of sūtra and tantra (freedom from extremes) are identical, but their methods are different, their conduct is different and so on.

Since there is no method of directly introducing this so called "natural state" that can be found in sūtra, one must depend on the methods taught by the Buddha in the tantras. And if one must depend on the methods taught by the Buddhas in the tantras, for what reason can one claim that is beyond or outside the Vajrayāna?

There is only one ritual taught in common Mahāyāna that bears on our discussion in a real sense — that is the ritual of generating relative bodhicitta. Apart from that, the other rituals in Mahāyāna such as the recitations of dharanis and so in do not bear on our discussion.

Secondly, since there is no method in common Mahāyāna for introducing or generating ultimate bodhicitta at all, how can one claim there is a method in sūtra for introducing mahāmudra? Even the word "mahāmudra" does not exist in any sūtra. If you claim there is such a method of introducing mahāmudra outside of a Vajrayāna context, in what sūtra is it taught, what Indian master composed the method?

You might claim, suchness is the same whether we are discussing prajñāpāramitā or mahāmudra, and to that I will readily agree — but the issue is not about reality per se, it is about how that reality is realized, what method is used and where that method comes from. Even the results of sūtra and tantra are not the equivalent. For example, there is no discussion in sūtra of the seven limbs of the three kāyas — this is purely related to the result, mahāmudra. Just as for example, one can find only four wisdoms in sūtra, but there are five wisdoms mentioned in Vajrayāna, in sūtra the word "Vajradhara" is never heard, and likewise, the term "mahāmudra" does not occur even once. If you are going to say there is mahāmudra in sūtra, why stop there? Why not say there is a sutra connate bliss, a sūtra Dzogchen, a sūtra tummo, a sūtra consort practice, none of which require empowerments?

When that subsequent introduction is combined with completion stage practices such kumbhaka or the intense devotion of guru yoga, mahāmudra can be realized rapidly.

Sautrantikas measured the ideas of other schools in terms of whether they were justified on the basis of the Agamas or not. Where they were, they left them alone, where they were not, they criticized them. The Abhidharmakośa is a collection of mainly Sarvastivadin doctrines, the bhaṣyam is a critical commentary on those.

From a teaching by Mingyur Rinpoche (underlines added):

Within the Secret Mantra Vajrayana path there are two divisions. The first one is the path of skilful means and the second is the path of liberation. If we explain further what the path of skilful means is, there are various methods through which to realize directly our nature of mind. It is revealed to us through these various types of practice.

Malcolm wrote:
If it is a  Secret Mantra Vajrayana path, it depends on empowerment.

Astus said:
The Vajrayana path can be divided into three sections. There is the development stage, completion stage and path of liberation (kyerim, dzogrim and drollam). Within these three paths one can decide whatever one likes to do, whatever one is feeling positive towards. But the best actually is the path of liberation.

As for the actual basic methods, although there are many ways of asserting mahamudra, there are two when divided according to the sutras and tantras...

The former refers to the ways of meditating on voidness as directly indicated in the expanded, intermediate and brief (Prajnaparamita Sutras). The supremely realized Arya Nagarjuna has said, “Except for this, there is no other pathway of mind leading to liberation.” Here I shall give relevant instruction on mahamudra in accord with these intentions of his and discuss the methods that lead you to know the mind, face to face, in keeping with the exposition of the lineage masters.

I don't really see the contradiction Malcolm. He seems to be saying that it is of greater benefit to practice Ngondro is one is going to practice Mahamudra, but also saying that sutra level Mahamudra meditation instruction is available in some sense without them.

Since some teachers seem to teach "sutra Mahamudra", whether they class it as that or not, to me it stands to reason that one is better off doing that than doing nothing at all, whether or not they choose to undertake Ngondro or other tantric practice, get empowerments etc. This is doesn't seem unusual, for basic meditation instruction to be offered independent of any tantric practice. Granted the manual goes beyond that, but part of it is just basic shamatha etc. instruction..and the parts of the manual that go beyond that are labeled as such.

I've been looking at Peter Barth's manual [ http://www.mahamudracenter.org/MMCMembe ... c420995709 ], and it has actually cleared up quite a lot of confusion, the first being the status of Mahamudra as a complete path in itself, independent of ngondro, tantra, etc:.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course this person directly contradicts himself on the same page: He says:

DesertDweller said:
Certainly, Mahamudra can be practiced independent of the path of tantra or in conjunction with the path of tantra, however one chooses.

In the Kagyu lineage and other lineages of Tibetan Buddhism, the ordinary preliminaries are taught prior to meditations of the type included in this manual. These include reflection on and awareness of (1) the precious human existence, (2) impermanance, (3) cause and effect or karma, and (4) the prevalence of suffering (samsara). In addition, special preliminaries are taught as a foundation to tantric Mahamudra and tantric Dzogchen practice. These include (1) refuge and bodhicitta, (2) Vajra Sattva purification, (3) mandala offering, and (4) guru yoga. Dzogchen has its own set of preliminaries which in some schools include reflection on and awareness of the illusory body and the practice of heat yoga (tummo). Interestingly, practices similar to these are advanced practices of the Kagyu and Gelug/Kagyu lineages.

In any case, preliminaries are indispensable to the practitioner. It is commonly noted by teachers that the preliminaries are in no way less important than the main body of teachings. In fact it is said that the preliminaries are (1) helpful at the outset to get one to turn to the dharma, (2) helpful on the path to get one to persist in dharma practice, and (3) helpful at the end to help one complete realization. Thus, their importance should be underscored. Several excellent texts are now available for those who want to follow the Tibetan traditions within the context of individual lineages. Serious students should refer to these.

Malcolm wrote:
Vajrasattva is a Vajrayāna practice; mandala offerings and guru yoga are practices unique to niruttarayoga tantra. Without receiving empowerment into a mandala such a Hevajra, Cakrasamvara and so on, there is no Mahāmudra to speak of, much less realize. He declares first that Mahāmudra is an independent path, and then second that that Vajrayāna practices are indispensable for Mahāmudra.

In general there are common and uncommon practices of Ngondro.

The practices of the common ngondro are reflecting on precious human birth eight freedoms and ten endowments, the faults of samsara, death and impermanence, and karma, in some order or another. Everyone must meditate on these.

After that, in sūtra, the main practice is the six perfections.

In Vajrayāna, one must practice prostrations in order to prepare the body for meditating the two stages; one must go for refuge and generate bodhicitta, likewise, one must purify with Vajrasattva. One must accumulate vast amounts of merit with mandala offerings which is a part of guru yoga. And one must supplicate the guru. It really does not matter much how much of these one does. What counts is that one does them with full attention as much as possible. You should practice each of these practices until you experience the signs associated with them, which can be learned from the texts so I wont mention those here. Don't focus on numbers.

OK - Take the example of the pure power of awareness regardless of any object of consciousness. At a level that most here will recognise, it would be hard to find evidence -or even 'points of entry'- for the notion that there is an awareness without an object of consciousness, let alone for the notion (much as I wrote on page 1) that this awareness is somehow held in common. However, if you assert that there are never any substantive links between the 'aware nature' aspects of an individual's mind and anything outside that mind -even after all the structures that hold together the sense of being an individual (ego, duality[, etc.]) have been removed-, then you also assert a defining characteristic as far as I can see - A self-enclosed 'unit of reality' instead of 'vast emptiness'.
But I never made such an assertion. I merely stated a basic Abhidharma definition: "all phenomena" are included in one aggregate, one sense base, and one element. All of my dharmas therefore, are unique to me in the sense that "I" am but a designation on a collection of aggregates. The basic definition of the material aggregate includes all sense organs and sense objects. The sounds, smells, sights, and so on, all sense objects in other words, are not part of my mind, per se, since they are material, and they are external to my physical sense organs (which is only half of the material aggregate).  Material aggregates may and do interact, for example, if you can see, hear, smell, taste, or touch someone else's body, their body is part of your material aggregate and vice versa. People with meditative capacity can observe the minds of others. I have never read in any sūtra and tantra that Buddha was able to "project" himself into the mind of another sentient being or influence another with his thoughts. His ability read the thoughts of others however is undisputed.

Where does Gorampa deny the conventional validity of appearances? He merely asserts that when a conventional entity is investigated it cannot be found at all upon analysis. He says:
Therefore all those objects and everything defined on those from the perspective of appearing to a mundane mind is said to be the meaning of defining the relative through the perspective of the conventional.
And:
The characteristic of the ultimate truth: since the noble’s equipoise is beyond cognitive range of ordinary beings, also dualistic vision subsides because of immaculate wisdom, ultimate truth is asserted to be never seeing any extreme of existence and non-existence, permanence or annihilation and so on.
And:
That being so, when seen by a human eye consciousness, regardless of what is seen or not seen by the eye consciousness of the other five kinds of living beings, apart from conventional water appearing to that eye consciousness the others are not perceived, Ultimately there is no also perception of water itself. Your apportioning the substance into six parts is wasted effort of grasping at things. 

That being so, although it has been much boasted that “It is necessary to define the relative as an appearance to non-analytical mind” ultimately it appears to have been defined through an analysis with reason, therefore, there has been a degeneration in the [Gelugpa] presentation of the relative of the prāsangika madhyamaka system.
And:
Although the mere I, the perceived object apprehended by innate self-grasping as “I am” existing conventionally is the prāsangika madhyamaka system, the [Gelugpa] assertion “The mere I exists conventionally even though it is not found to be the same as, different than or both [the same as and different than] the aggregates when its sameness or difference is sought to be established” is very invalid because when it is sought like that even the mere I is necessarily found to be non-existent.
And:
That mere I itself conventionally is the agent of action and also is the experiencer of ripening in this system defined by the power of appearing to mind of the relative subject because to the mind of a mundane person, the mere I appears as the agent of action and the experiencer of a result, i.e. “I did an action”, “I experienced a result.”
And:
Prāsaṇgika and Svatantrika do not differ in the presentation of the conventional because the Prāsaṇgikas also accept autonomous arguments in the presentation of the conventional.

I have been wearing a ngagapa shawl on appropriate occasions for some time now.

And what with usage, the cat sleeping on it (sorry, it wasn't intended) and so forth it could maybe do with a clean. So I have to wonder whether it is colour-fast and can be washed (perhaps at low temperature) in ordinary water and washing agent, or whether I have to take it to the dry cleaner.

I know that the type that I have is not uncommon, so I'd very much appreciate it if anybody who reckons that they have *exactly* the same kind of shawl and has gone as far as to wash it can let me know whether the colours run in a water wash or not.

You seem to be depicting an infinite number of pan-multi-universes/realities/whatever, each of which is the everlasting mind-stream of a sentient being {'Everlasting' because absolute separateness puts enough of a cordon around a mind-stream for it to appear as a 'thing-in-itself' - This reality, then, consists only of a single individual, a view better known as Solipsism _ _   I'm getting lost - No wonder everyone here advises regular Buddhist coaching!

Malcolm wrote:
Appearances are sometimes deceptive, especially when people read things into them that are not there, for example, mistaking mist for smoke and thinking there is a fire.

Sarvadharma, in this context, refers to the phenomena proper to a given "person" formed from a unique set of causes and conditions, some of which are shared, and some of which are not. For example, the container universe is a condition we all share, karma is not a condition we all share, karma is unique and individual, even when its ripening appears to be collective, for example, just as cherries tree blossom at the same time in the spring, but every tree is a unique and distinct individual arising from its own set of causes and conditions.

The inseparability of the two truths means merely that empty things arise from empty causes, like for example, separate and distinct empty mind streams.
So 'things' -even emptiness itself- are empty, but other supposed truths -like separateness/distinction- are not empty at all? Again, why don't people just make all this clearer, rather than leaving the water muddy as they usually do?[/quote]

One of the conventional rules of causation is homogeneity — wheat from wheat seeds, corn from corn seeds, apples from apple seeds and so on. In regards to human beings, we all have our unique set of causes and conditions that both enforces our clade (human) at the same time that it provides us with our individual capacities in intelligence, vision, strength, health, longevity and so on.

Mindstreams are also unique in the sense that karma that I perform will not ripen on another, nor will the karma of others ripen on me.

And of course, all that arises from causes and conditions is empty.

That existent ‘previous produced earlier, but presently non-existent’ is a view that existing existents perish; therefore, it will be an annihilationist view. As such, why? There will be many faults for the view ‘is and is not’ in existents, because of that, that statement ‘existents are without inherent existence", is seeing the truth, is the middle way, that is ultimately established.
But the main flaw that can be seen in the Gelugpa view is that they jump through hoops trying to preserve conventional phenomena, seemingly without realizing the purpose of Madhyamaka is not to defend relative truth but rather to realize the reality which relative truth conceals (that there is no reality at all).

His statement does not mean that there are not conventionally speaking, infinite myriads of sentient beings, the traces of all of whom sustain the appearance of the container universe. Minds have no form, but they generate appearances based on traces; minds have no form, and yet they are sustained on their own individual sets of causes and conditions — hence we say that they are empty. The inseparability of the two truths means that we do not reject appearances, for example, sentient beings, and we do not imagine that they arise due to any other reason than arising from conditions, which means they are empty, just as we are.

That was the nature of the question, the relative connection "framework". Why I have recently posted the question (multiple times) about the computer network analogy. Malcolm is the only one who has really voted. Stating that in Buddhadarma there is no mind to mind connection, that the mind is limited to the physical body.

I was asking if everyone else agreed with that because as I have stated many other traditions have such capability/connection framework.

Study the two-truths, it would resolve the seeming contradictions and inconsistencies you feel you're encountering.

Right now you're struggling with your attempts to reconcile these issues through a neo-nondual type approach where you're forced to posit some sort of universal substratum, and that view is refuted by the buddhadharma, for good reason.

If you simply made an effort to comprehend how conventional designations and relative cognitions relate to ultimate truth (i.e., their emptiness), then you'd undoubtably resolve these issues you are struggling with.

Jeff said:
Think of it more like a shared consciousness that is the Form component of emptiness, just as we all seemingly exist in the same multi universe. I have no doubt relative to emptiness.

The struggling component comes from the groups description of Buddhadarma that is in contrast to what is directly experinenced by many relative to mind-mind contact/connection.

Bakmoon said:
You misunderstand that passage from the Avatamsaka. If you look at the entire passage it is clear that it is a collection of descriptions of the nature of the powers and activities of the various Bodhisattvas. Specifically, it says:
They are able to shake infinite worlds in the ten directions by spiritual powers; their minds are
broad, being equal to the cosmos. They know various explanations of truth, they know how
many sentient beings there are, they know the differences among sentient beings, they know
the birth of suffering, they know the extinction of suffering; while knowing all acts are like reflected
images, they carry out the deeds of bodhisattvas. They sever the root of all subjection to birth.
Everything in this passage is a description of the many spiritual powers wielded by the Great Bodhisattvas, and immediately after saying their minds are "broad [and] equal to the cosmos" it describes the extent of their knowledge of sentient beings. It is clear from context that the meaning of the passage is that the Great Bodhisattvas mind is broad and equal to the cosmos in terms of the scope of its abilities, not that the mind IS the cosmos.

Ummmm. Jeff, Mahābodhisattvas in general means bodhisattvas on the tenth bhumi.

In any case, this passage does not contradict my assertion that conventionally speaking, the mind is located in the body and its boundaries are the sense organs. All Buddhist traditions agree that mind is located in the center of the body mass, approximately at the heart. Someone might object and say, "What about when it says that when looking for the mind it cannot be found inside the body, outside the body and so on...", this is also true, but conventionally speaking we understand the mind to be located in the "heart".

Sooner or later you are going figure out that you are trying impose Advaita Vedanta concepts on Buddhdharma, and you will realize that it does not work. Then you will have to decide which you like better and than follow that path. But they are not reconcilable.

Of course there is such a thing as emptiness, it's the ultimate nature of phenomena. The ideas that people are expressing here that conventional and ultimate truths don't exist is just plain weird and contrary to the valid cognizers of ordinary beings and Yogis. I think it's a nihilistic view - but just because something is merely imputed doesn't mean that it doesn't exist, in fact, that's how it actually does exist. Mere imputations are existent phenomena, and existent phenomena are those things and non-things that are apprehended by valid cognizers.

This how the abhijñā of knowing the minds of others works. This is why only a mind which embraces a characteristic can be known to a yogi who has such capacity.

A story by Ven. Shengyan ( source ):

In Taiwan, I have a disciple who has been practicing with me for quite sometime. He has a good command of English, so when a certain Tibetan rinpoche was scheduled to lecture, he was asked to translate. He was very nervous. He had never practiced Tantra, and was afraid that he wouldn’t understand what the rinpoche said. In a quandary, he finally decided that if he didn’t understand, it was the rinpoche’s responsibility to make him understand. With this thought he went to sleep. The rinpoche came to him in a dream, placed his hand on the disciple’s head, and said, “You don’t have to be nervous. You will understand everything I say tomorrow. You don’t have to worry.” He had a wonderful feeling when the rinpoche touched him. The next morning it was the rinpoche who woke him up. My disciple immediately prostrated to the rinpoche and thanked him for entering his dream. Curious, the rinpoche asked, “What happened last night?” The disciple told him, and after a few more questions from the rinpoche, he concluded that it might not have been the rinpoche but a “yidam,” a Dharma protector, who came to him.

Later I asked him if he had ever dreamed of me. He said, “Yes, indeed, many times.” Then I asked if he thought that it was me who had entered his dreams. He said, “No, because Shih-fu doesn’t have a yidam.” So then I said to him, “O.K., I will go and find myself a yidam so that the next time you dream of me, you will be sure that it is my yidam that is entering your dream.” My disciple objected, “But in Ch’an there is no such thing as a yidam.”

Jeff said:
Thank you for the story Astus. Does that mean that you disagree with Malcolm and such is possible in the Buddhadharma?

Malcolm wrote:
Why don't you try reading the paragraph immediately before these two:
In both traditions it is natural for a practitioner to have unusual physiological and psychological reactions — seeing, hearing, or even dreaming things out of the ordinary. A Tantric practitioner will take what he has seen, heard, or dreamt as signals that the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are recognizing his practice. A Ch’an practitioner may also have such experiences, but they are not emphasized and are not taken as signals or signs of anything in particular.
Of course, the above statement is also inaccurate. A "Tantric" practitioner will do no such thing. Every practice as specific experiences that are outlined, including dreams, and when a practitioner has such experiences described in the text, it is taken as an indication that their practice is moving ahead.

Ok, then could you describe how the guru visits them in this "dream state" (which is in their mind)? If one is manipulating someone's perceptions in their mind, does that not constitute affecting them and directly disagree with what Malcolm stated earlier?

Malcolm wrote:
You might see a guru in your dreams, but it is still your dream and not them "visiting" you in some real sense.

"Finally agreeing"? We were never in disagreement about knowing the minds of others. You should look up the word "abhijñā". "Access" provides a problem. Buddhas and bodhisattvas are unable to influence the minds of others — if they were able to influence the minds of others we all would have woken up eons ago and there would be no samsara.

Malcolm wrote:
There is no substratum, minds do not "overlap." The reason why Buddhas and high bodhisattvas can know the minds of others, know past lives, etc. is because the nature of everything is emptiness and therefore while there is no universal substratum there is also no impediments because everything is empty. And since everything is empty, Buddha's wisdom is unimpeded in all directions and times.

In that respect, the dharmakāya of the tathāgatagarbha is definitely released from the sheath of afflictions. Bhagavān, the so called "tathāgatagarbha" is tathāgata's wisdom of emptiness that cannot be seen by śravakas and pratyekabuddhas.
Dharmakāya is just the total realization of emptiness. Nothing more.

Further, The Trikāya Sūtra states:
Kṣitigarbha, tathāgatas are endowed with the three kāyas: the dharmakāya, the sambhogkāya and the nirmanakāya…In that regard, the dharmakāya is visible to the tathagātas. The sambhogakāya is visible to bodhisattvas. The nirmanakāya is visible to ordinary persons on the stage of devotional practice.

Kṣitigarbha, for example, clouds are produced on the basis of an empty sky; rain is produced on the basis of clouds. Likewise, the sambhogakaȳa appears on the basis of the dharmakāya, and the nirmanakāya appears on the basis of the sambhogakāya.

Malcolm wrote:
We have three dimensions, body, voice and mind. The Buddha's have three kāyas. The nirmanakāya exist because ordinary sentient beings cannot have contact with the sambgogakāya at all because of the afflictions they possess. When they remove those afflictions, then they can see the Sambhogakāya, but this takes many countless eons lifetimes of practice. Finally, when they become a Buddha, they can see the dharmakāya.

Therefore, all transmissions for ordinary people like ourselves occur on an external physical way, through speech and symbols. If we happen to realize the meaning of what is being taught, this is referred to a "mind transmission", but it is not really a transmission in the sense of a message communicated and a message received mentally. It is more in the sense of a message communicated through words and symbols whose inner significance is then realized directly. Anyone who tells you that there is some actually mind to mind transmission in Buddhadharma at the level of our impure perception is either lying or they have no idea what they are talking about.

Buddhas cannot communicate liberation into the minds of others. If they could, there would be no sentient beings left. The Buddha said famously, we cannot wash away suffering, he cannot remove it with his hand, nor can he make us liberated, but he can teach us a path.

The very quick summary, as I understand it:

Vajrayana exists for two reasons:
*To provide a different and wider array of means for liberation that allows for more people to get there.
*To provide radically faster means to Buddhahood than traditional mahayana.

This traditionally involves bonding with a Yidam (fully awakened deity) via a guru and, through these bonds and their blessings, transform affliction into wisdom (as opposed to abandoning affliction with wisdom).

Beyond this, there are also Mahamudra and Dzogchen who focus less on the yidam part (guru devotion still mandatory) and more on being introduced to one's nature by the guru and work with this as a speedy means to buddhahood.

Hi Malcolm,

How is a "reliable person" defined according to Buddhadharma?

Malcolm wrote:
It would be the Buddha or his disciples. Really, what we are talking about here is citational or scriptural authority. The Samdhinirmocana Sūtra states:
As such, the reasoning of a valid proof is the authority of direction perception; the authority of inference, and the authority of trustworthy citations which is valid through the five valid characteristics.
Those five valid characteristics are:
The characteristic of being supported on a direct perception, the characteristic of being supported on a direct perception which is the basis for that, the characteristic of the application of example in one's own reasoning, the characteristic of perfectly establishment and the characteristic of a scripture proven to be completely valid.
You should look into this sūtra for a more detailed explanation.

But we also have this from the Pubbakotthaka Sutta:

Those who have not known, seen, penetrated, realized, or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction in others that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed and pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal and consummation; whereas those who have known, seen, penetrated, realized, and attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed and pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal and consummation."

I doubt it was intended this way but the error in tone is pretty glaring.

Malcolm wrote:
One can't have an error in tone.



Caodemarte said:
In terms of fact, and respectfully, Bodhgaya is not like the Vatican or a Jewish congregation run by Protestants. It is not the organizational or religious HQ of Buddhism or of any Buddhist group.  Almost all religions have pilgrimage sites.

Yes, actually it is. Bodhgaya should be administered by an international coalition of Buddhist organizations.
In Buddhism, there is no one fundamental text that all must believe in with a requirement from God for all able believers to perform a pilgrimage to one site as a fundamental duty (let alone a Buddhist equivalent of the Kaaba in Mecca). It is simply incorrect to say that "Bodhgaya is to Buddhists what Mecca is to Muslims."

Malcolm wrote:
In fact, Bodhgaya is more to Buddhists than Mecca is to Muslims — there is no encouragement in the Koran for Muslims to worship at the Kaaba, per se. An ancient pilgrimage site, the Kaaba, eventually became associated with the house built by Ibrahim.

The Buddha, on the other hand, clearly stated that all Buddhists should try to visit the four memorial spots, the site of his birth, awakening, first teaching and nirvana.

Caodemarte said:
"In fact the demise of Buddhism in India is attributable to both the country's major religions, with Islam in effect finishing off what Hinduism began." would seem to be an unforced error or an interpretation, but not a fact.

Malcolm wrote:
Try reading "The Hardships and downfall of Buddhism in India by Verardi. In this book, he recounts a long history the decline of Buddhism in India. Hindu hostility to Buddhism in the Post-Gupta period is well documented, and supported by anecdotal reports of conflicts between Mahasiddhas and their Hindu enemies.

That Muslims delt the death blow to Indian Buddhism in the 12th century is beyond dispute.



Caodemarte said:
"...so Buddhists in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and other places that suffered foreign invasion, or in small, poor countries like Bhutan, might rejoice in China's emergence as a superpower"  because China has a lot of Buddhists. Well, no. You could argue that Indonesian Buddhists are mostly Chinese and that some of them take pride in China's rise, but that is hardly because of shared religious values. I guess you could say this is not an error of fact because of the word might, but c'mon.

DKR is making a rhetorical point, i.e., that marginalization of Buddhists in border countries might well cause them to look north in the growing showdown between China and India.

The idea that that the Indian government is trying to whitewash history to avoid offending Muslims, especially this one,  makes no sense to anyone familiar with Indian politics (please examine why Modi could not a get a US visa until recently).

Malcolm wrote:
You do realize that a Mosque abuts the Bodhgaya stupa and it broadcasts its call to prayer loudly and insistently five times a day. There are quite a number of groups who, since Bodhgaya was "rediscovered" in the 19th century, have decided to attach themselves to the Mahabodhi Temple.

But it is a place for Buddhists — not Hindus, not Muslims, etc. In general, the sentiment of the article is correct. The Buddhist epoch in Indian history is most important, and yet most Indians these days know more about the history of England than they do Indian history during that point in time.

Yes, but this is an erroneous way of seeing the self. Self is not empty of self, it's empty of inherently existent self, otherwise you are negating what exists. You seem to have a problem with conventionally designated things having a conventionally designated nature.

Malcolm wrote:
Things have no natures, conventionally or otherwise. Look, we can say water is wet, but actually, there no water that possesses a wet nature. Water is wet, that is all. There is no wetness apart from water and not water apart from wetness. If you say a given thing has a separate nature, you are making the exact mistaken Nāgārajuna points out in the analysis of movement, i.e., it is senseless to say there is a "moving mover." Your arguments are exactly the same, you are basically saying there is an "existing existence."


Tsongkhapafan said:
The self appears, how does it appear, what is its basis for appearance? Of you say that it is not the aggregates, than likewise, then the parts of a table are not the basis for the tables appearance. In both cases we are discussing an identity: self, table.

Malcolm wrote:
Now you are contradicting yourself, as anyone can plainly see who can read English.


Tsongkhapafan said:
Of course the parts of the table are the basis for designating table, but 'table' is the possessor and the parts of the table are the possessions of the table, and as Nagarjuna says, possessor and possessed cannot be one and the same.

Malcolm wrote:
This is precisely because of the above point I referenced. Nagārjuna clearly shows that characteristics/natures are untenable.

Candrakīrti points out that the possessor does not exist at all, but for the mere purpose of discourse, we allow conventionally the idea that there is a possessor of parts even though no possessor of parts exists. This mistake that we indulge in can act as an agent, for example a car, we can use it as such, but it is empty of being a car — an agent is as empty of being an agent as its actions are empty of being actions.

Tsongkhapafan said:
Phenomena do not have intrinsic characteristics even conventionally, so your insistence that they do indicates to me that you have not properly studied the great Indian Madhyamaka masters. Arthakriya, functionality, is not proof of nature-possession.
You've errected a strawman. I have not said at any point that phenomena possess intrinsic characteristics, but they do exist and they do have imputed characteristics and an imputed nature.

Malcolm wrote:
As I said, you have fallen for a pyramid scheme.

Malcolm wrote:
And thus you fall again into the trap of realism — where do coffee and tea hold their nature? From their own sides? No, according to what you just said they owe their flavor to karmic appearances and therefore have no nature of their own at all.

Tsongkhapafan said:
Conventionally phenomena exist and have their own natures, everyone knows that.

Malcolm wrote:
No, conventional phenomena appear, and because no one knows they they cannot be established according to any of the four extremes (not merely like illusions) they are illusions and they become objects of false cognitions, aka relative truths.

Tsongkhapafan said:
To deny something that exists is nihilism, despite what others have said on this thread. You seem to be denying the valid conventional nature of phenomena, therefore this is tantamount to nihilism. This conventional nature is not intrinsic yet it exists and is apprehended by valid cognition.

Malcolm wrote:
One cannot accuse someone of nihilism when they have not advanced the existence of something. Likewise, you cannot accuse someone of stealing merely because they have found an empty bank vault. Your assertion is like accusing someone who discovers a theft of the crime itself even though they are innocent. As Nāgārjuna states:
If I had a thesis I would be guilty, but since I alone have no thesis I alone am innocent.

The table is empty of a table because a table is solely an imputation from our side. The collection of parts we are designating as a table has not been table from its own side ever and will never be such a table, and therefore is empty of the table we are imputing.

There is no table in absence of the parts either, since there is no basis upon which to impute the table.

Your argument suffers from being conned by the pyramid scheme of realism — the idea that you can just keep borrowing from someone else to pay off your previous investors. Your argument suffers from a hidden flaw of unconsciously resorting to parabhāva, gzhan dngos, dependent existence, which is just a form of inherent existence, svabhāva, rang bzhin.

For a man it is a table, for a dog it is a shed, for a fly it is an airport, for an animalcule it is a wide country.

It is no table, if viewed dispassionatly.

Tsongkhapafan said:
What makes table different from chair? Conceptual designation, function, characteristics that are merely imputed by mind. There is no objective table, but there doesn't need to be for to table to have the merely imputed nature of table. Table has the nature of table and chair has the nature of chair CONVENTIONALLY. Of course no nature can be found upon investigation other than emptiness, I'm not saying it does, but any normal person know the different between a chair and a table and the function of each, therefore table is not empty of table and chair is not empty of chair.

If people who are completely unqualified to do so pick up the banner of "Dharma teacher" and mislead people down a false path not taught by the Buddha, then the reputation of the Dharma will be damaged. But if we follow the advice of Sakya Pandita there will be no problem at all:
In brief, since that which has been spoken by the Buddha, gathered by the compilers, meditated by siddhas, explained by paṇḍitas, translated by the translators and known to scholars to be taught by the Buddha, it is necessary to hear, explain, meditate and practice that. 

If a teaching which is the opposite of those should arise, since it was not a doctrine of the Buddha, one should not listen to it, explain it, meditate on it nor practice it even if it seems very profound. Although there are other non-buddhist and false teachings that seem to be very good, leave them aside because they are not the doctrine of the Buddha.

It is empty of inherently existent table, i.e., table is merely a conceptual imputation upon a the valid basis of imputation for table, the parts and the collection of parts. It is not an independent phenomenon as it appears to be.

The definition of element is that which holds its own nature, and this refers to any phenomenon. Table is a phenomenon that holds its own nature. What is its nature?

This gets to be a boring assertion in the long run, since this is also the classic assertion mahayana makes about hinayana.

Malcolm wrote:
It is completely different. Why? Because in common Mahāyāna it is only permitted to use sense objects if you have no attachment to them. The examples of Aryadharma, Sadaprarudita and so on are examples of āryas on the stages, not common people.

In your example you cite the following:
Manjusri said, "All defilements are equal [in reality]. I have realized that equality through right practice.
But who is Mañjuśrī? A bodhisattva of the tenth stage.

As for this assertion:
The whole point of emptiness in Mahayana is that there is nothing to renounce or be rid of since affliction is empty and samsara and nirvana are not two.
Secret Mantra and Paramitayāna share the same view, where they differ is in method. There is no method of practice in Paramitayāna for ordinary people to practice by taking desire into their path. It simply does not exist. Hence Candragomin, a quintessential Mahāyāna author writes:
Objects and poisons are alike, pleasing just when first tasted...
Moreover, in Mahāyāna one meditates on desire, anger and ignorance via antidotes. This is not the case in Secret Mantra.

Malcolm wrote:
I did not say there was no preliminary sense of renunciation in Vajrayāna. What I said was is that Vajrayāna is not a PATH of renunciation.

This is the logic. We understand that samsara is a terrible place. We wish to be free of it. We look around, and we see that the path of renunciation is not effective in this day and age because our afflictions are too strong. This is why the tantra says things like the Vajrapañjara-tantra:
Created by passion, the worldly
shall be liberated by the same passion.
Or the Guhyasamaja:
The passionate desiring wisdom
always rely on the five desire objects
The method of doing this, of practicing a path of non-renunciation, is to practice creation stage and completion stages. Likewise, through the method is a little different in Dzogchen as the Mind Mirror of Vajrasattva states:
This nectar of bodhicitta, one’s vidyā, 
for example, is like a divine precious jewel
that warms when left in a cold place,
cools when left in a hot place,
and gives light when left in a dark place.
In the same way, if one possesses the meaning of realizing
this self-originated vidyā,
afflictions become the companions of wisdom, 
even though afflictions arise 
they do not obscure when they are under the power of wisdom.
And:
If the king of secret mantra is practiced, afflictions turn into wisdom. For example, when a lamp is lifted in an empty house, darkness turns into light; likewise, when the lamp of wisdom is raised, ignorance transforms into vidyā. When the realization of reality has arisen in one’s continuum, all afflictions arise as the companions of wisdom.

"To do good, to refrain from evil, this is the teaching of 10000 Buddhas."

And as the story goes 'a child of 7 knows this, but a man of 70 doesn't know how to do it. That's what we need the Buddhadharma for - wise action is not easy.

Malcolm wrote:
Refrain from all evil,
perfect [all] virtues,
thoroughly tame one's mind:
this is the teaching of the Buddha.
One is supposed to avoid evil (pappa, sinful) actions because they lead to birth in lower realms. One is to engage in virtuous (kusala) actions because they lead to birth in higher realms. One is to tame one's mind, because this is the path to liberation.

But here there is no mention of being a "good person." The goal of Buddhadharma is not to become "a better person." The goal of the Dharma is to transcend our afflictive state so that it is no longer necessary to engage in positive actions to maintain a birth in higher realms and avoid negative actions which lead to rebirth in lower realms. As long as one is driven by the three poisons, it is not possible to be a truly "good person."

For example, even through we practice the six perfections in order to attain buddhahood with the motivation to become buddhas for the benefit of all sentient beings, as you note below, bodhisattva activity may not be considered the actions of a "good person" when viewed from outside.

Secondly the practice of the six perfections is actually for one's own benefit, not directly for the benefit of others. The four means of conversion on the other hand are directly for the benefit of others. One should understand this distinction well.

For example, the Buddha gave his horse and ornaments to his father, Śuddhodhana, when he self-ordained. The golden bowl given to him by Sujāta was left in the Nairañja rather than being given to some poor local villagers. Buddha's disposition of his wealth does not conform to either conservative notions of wealth preservation nor does it conform to liberal notions of social justice. He gave away his horse and gear to his father who did not need them, and left his golden bowl in a stream while there villagers just a stone's throw away who were suffering crushing poverty.

As Sakya Paṇḍita explains:

If wealth of the higher classes was given to the lower classes by the Bhagavan, although slight beneficial conditions for this life would occur, since it would become a cause of lower realms because of not requesting liberation, the Bodhisattva decided he would not give his wealth away.


Or there is the Jataka tale of how the Buddha in his past life as Viśvaṃtara gave away his wife and children to be brahmin’s servants when practicing the perfection of generosity —— such acts hardly conform to our modern liberal notions of the "good person."

So we really must not allow such tepid notions as "Buddhism is just about being a good person" to go unchallenged.

That's a bit harsh, Simon. The Buddhist path certainly is about "learning how to live [one's] life" and does discourage identification of oneself "as a Buddhist" and places more importance on being a good (wise, compassionate, etc) person than on "being a good Buddhist or knowing Buddhist doctrine".

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddha's path starts with refuge. For example, in the Kalmas sutra:
As if, venerable sir, a person were to turn face upwards what is upside down, or to uncover the concealed, or to point the way to one who is lost or to carry a lamp in the darkness, thinking, 'Those who have eyes will see visible objects,' so has the Dhamma been set forth in many ways by the Blessed One. We, venerable sir, go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma for refuge, and to the Community of Bhikkhus for refuge. Venerable sir, may the Blessed One regard us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life, from today."
The Buddhist path does not in any sense discourage one from thinking of oneself as a "buddhist".

The idea that the Buddha placed more importance on being a "good person" than on the three trainings of śīla, samadhi and prajñā, and the three prajñās of hearing, reflection and meditation is really a very strange and misleading idea. Being a good person will not free one from samsara, which after all is the point of the Buddha's teachings, i.e., to become from from samsara.

This represents a total misunderstanding of what Dzogchen is and what Vajrayāna is. Dzogchen is not separate from Vajrayāna in anyway shape of form. Dzogchen is a part of Vajrayāna Secret Mantra as even a cursory examination of the basic texts of the tradition will indicate.

Further, Dzogchen may not necessarily involve the four hundred thousands famous to us, in fact one of the earliest presentations of that sequence of practice is to be found in the klong gsal nyi ma 'bar ma tantra, which forms the foundation for most of the Nyinthig cycles from the Khandro Nyinthig onward. Moreover, there are a series of preliminary practices in Dzogchen that are indispensable such as the separation of samsara and nirvana, semzins, and so on.

Empowerment is absolutely necessary in Vajrayāna. Dzogchen Atiyoga is merely one of three inner tantra divisions. It is not in any way separate from Vajrayāna at all. Not only, they are hardly "another form of mindfulness practice."

Malcolm wrote:
Bhavaviveka says:
If there is an autonomous argument, it is only necessary to establish that the given phenomena appear in common to the proponent and opponent because at that time the given phenomena has not been established in common appearance.”
On other words, all that is needed is an agreement that indeed a table appears before both parties. They needn't agree on anything else. Thus when Bhavaviveka rejects Buddhapalita's dialectical argument in favor of a procedural argument, he is not saying that we need to accept that there is a seed established by an intrinsic characteristic, he is merely saying that we admit only that we both perceive a seed which then can be analyzed, in this case, of whether it is reasonable that there is arising from self.

The reason why Candra rejects Bhavaviveka's insistence on a procedural argument rather than a dialectical argument stems from the following:
When the eye and so on is grasped as a given phenomena of the relative, it is not established for the proponent; and when the eye and so on is grasped as a given phenomena of the ultimate, it is not established for the opponent.
In this case, since there is a fundamental disagreement in terms of the basis where one is arguing from, Candra insists that the opponent merely needs to be overthrown with a dialectical argument. But one thing it is important to bear in mind, Candrakīrti does not go at great lengths to expand his views on this subject in the Prasannapāda. Moreover, Candra certainly accepts procedural or autonomous arguments when presenting the conventional.

Thus there is no difference in these Madhyamikas Madhyamaka, but there is a difference in how one should debate opponents, and that is all. Gorampa states in his Moonrays:

Therefore the essential point of the difference between Prāsaṇgika and Svatantrika is defined upon whether autonomous arguments are accepted or not accepted in the context of investigating reality, i.e. it is actually in the context of rejecting the arising of the four extremes that autonomous arguments validity or invalidity is negated or proven.

The suchness known by madhyamikas
is free from the four extremes:
not existent, not nonexistent,
not both and neither.
The suchness realized by madhyamikas
is free from the four alternatives:
permanence, annihilation, 
both and neither.
Beyond such extremes as existence and nonexistence,
free from permanence and annihilation, 
liberated from consciousness and objects of consciousness, 
this is a text of the Great Madhyamaka.
We all take it for granted that no one in Tibetan Buddhism attains awakening based on practicing sūtra — that is what tantra is for. But I think these later, and novel, Tibetan interpretations of sūtra doctrines are a distraction, especially when they are not actually found in the writings of Indian masters.

In fact, the whole three turnings trip really comes from a Korean Yogacara master.

Malcolm wrote:
smcj retracted this response while I was writing a reply, so since I spent half an hour working on this I feel compelled to post it anyway

They are less authoritative than Indian scholars by definition.

And as I pointed out, among Chinese and Tibetan scholars, there is absolutely no agreement at all as to what sutras belong to the third turning and what sutras belong the second turning and no one in India, so far as we know (in Tibetan sources at least) ever compiled a list of them.

The clearest definition I have been able to find is from the widely cited commentary on the Āryākṣayamatinirdeśa Sūtra, the Āryākṣayamatinirdeśaṭīkā by Vasubandhu where he says:
Any sūtras that are explained in order to cultivate the characteristics of the noble path or realize the characteristics of the noble path are called "sutras of provisional meaning" because they teach a path which leads to nirvana. Any sūtras called "an entry into the result" are any sūtras that are taught in order to realize the result that has not been accomplished, those are the sutras of the definitive meaning.

Any sūtras called "entry into karma and deeds" are sutras which teach that engaging in virtuous karma produces a pleasing experience and engaging in nonvirtuous karma produces displeasing experience. Those are the sūtras of the provisional meaning. Any sutras said "to be taught in order to exhaust karma and affliction," sutras, which in order to exhaust karma and to exhaust afflictions, teach many methods of exhausting those, are sutras of the definitive meaning... etc.
Vasubandhu gives four other criterias for provisional and definitive sūtras, such as the difference between whether phenomena are taught to be afflictive or pure; whether samsara is to be regard with revulsion or is to be regarded as nondual with nirvana; whether topics are taught in words, letters, and so on such as the jatakas, etc or whether it is a sutra that teaching the profound that is difficult to see and comprehend, the selflessness in phenomena and the imperceptibility of the nature of emptiness; and finally, whether there are many words and meanings with much discursiveness or whether there is very little discursiveness and emphasis on instructions on samadhi.

In Indian texts, in terms of whether given sutras are considered provisional or definitive little or no attention is paid to them in terms of when they were taught by the Buddha — instead all that counts is their content.

Related to this is the fact that there is not one single sūtra or Indian text that links the tathāgatagarbha doctrine to sūtras of the definitive meaning, not a single one! Not even the tathāgatagarbha sūtras themselves. Don't you find this to be amazing?

The second turning and the third turning are doctrinally indentical.

smcj said:
The Bhagavan, beginning from the nonexistence of the inherent existence of all phenomena, beginning from their absence of arising, absence of ceasing, being peaceful from the beginning, being parinirvana by nature, turned a second very amazing wheel of Dharma with the form of the description of emptiness to those who had correctly entered into the Mahāyāna. This wheel of Dharma was surpassable, circumstantial, of provisional meaning and became a basis of dispute.
The Bhagavan, beginning from the nonexistence of the inherent existence of all phenomena, beginning from their absence of arising, absence of ceasing, being peaceful from the beginning, being parinirvana by nature, turned a third very amazing wheel of Dharma possessing fine distinctions to those who correctly entered into all vehicles.

Malcolm wrote:
The sole difference between these two turnings is that in the former case, emptiness was taught, and in the latter case, fine distinctions were taught, but the doctrine of both turnings begin "from the nonexistence of the inherent existence of all phenomena, begin from their absence of arising, absence of ceasing, being peaceful from the beginning, being parinirvana by nature." One might also add, that the third turning was intended for everyone.

All phenomena refers to all conditioned and unconditioned phenomena, FYI.

This is also false on three points — Samantabhadri is an example of a female buddha, Tara is an example of a female buddha, as is Prajñāpāramita, as Vajrayogini, Yeshe Tsogyal, Mandarava, etc. There are many yidams where the male deity has its back to the observer, with the mother deity acting as the main deity. The third point is that images of father and mother deities are not "Tantric sex images."

In Vajrayāna there is no such thing as "tantric sex." There are some yogas that might resemble sex to people who do not have instructions or samaya. But we don't talk about them. If people want to learn, they can seek out a qualified teacher.

Although alcoholism is found in my family, I've never had an issue with it. I may drink casually with friends once or twice a month, but never to the point of drunkenness. I may take a small amount of some tantric "medicine" that involves whisky more regularly. I certainly take some alcohol at the times of tsok offerings. To impose a strict rule on myself never to drink any alcohol would be artificial and useless, maybe harmful.

I said it appeared that is what you are saying. You read your own language, and you will see.

We are not denying the existence of the imputation "table," that imputation is clearly being made. We are saying, like Candrakīrti, that no table can be found when the basis for imputing a table, it's parts, is examined. We are saying, like Candrakīrti, that there is no actual thing that possesses parts, for example a self. And if there is no possessor of parts, there are no parts that are possessed, correct? Thus a composite thing is empty of the designation it is being designation with. The designation does not come from its side, it comes from the side of the one making the imputation, right? How is a thing desiginated? It is designated on the basis of an appearance. An appearance of what? An appearance of parts. Does the thing exist in its parts? No. Does it exist separate from those parts? No. Does it exist in one of those parts? No. Therefore, the thing is just a designation and it is not real. When we say something is not real, this means it is empty. What is it empty of? Itself. There is no table, there is no car, and so on. There is no self that possesses the five aggregates, nevertheless, a self is imputed upon the five aggregates. When the five aggregates are examined a self is not found with the aggregates, separate from them or in any one of them. Hence we know that the self does not exist. It is a mere imputation on a collection of parts. All composite phenomena are the same.

Things like tables, cars and selves are empty of themselves because when their basis of designation is examined, they are not found in their respective bases of designation or separate from them. When something is not found, it is called "nonexistent." In this case, it is not the nonexistence of something which once existed and then became nonexistent, according to mundane convention; in this case the thing sought for was never there from beginning, it never even arose.

No, here we are just talking about how things are designated on their parts according to their conventional appearance to a non-deluded mind. For our friends TD and TKF, it appears, based on their statements, that tables appear to a conventional valid cognition automatically.

The question in terms of how this Sakya commentary (or commentaries) relates to the Commentary in the Tengyur is about when it was translated. It has no date and no translator, so it's hard to determine (and also makes its 'Sri Lankan' authorship look more suspicious), but it does seem to have a dedication prayer which seems to be by a famous Chinese-sponsored (and/or favored) Tibetan king, Miwang Tobgyel something or other, who lived in the 1700s, which indicates that he had probably had something to do with the translation...

It becomes unnecessary to differentiate that supernormal phenomena can only happened in mind realm but not in physical realm since afterall physical relam is a reflection of what is in the mind. In other words, you don't have to say that Buddha can only manifest supernormal abilities in some beings mind stream and not in the physical realm because there are fixed physical laws (this is your previous position), we just have to say "some beings have the karma to see Buddha manifesting supernormal abilities while others don't have the karma.

If a table is empty of being a table, it follows that a table is as empty of being a table as a car is [empty of being a table]. It follows absurdly that one could validly impute anything on any basis of designation.

As a matter of fact, if you need a car to go to town, what don't you just impute a car on the table that's in the living room?

Malcolm wrote:
Your reason is specious. We don't need to speak of a car being empty of a table at all because we do not (in worldly convention) impute tables on the parts of a car, nor a car on the parts of table. Nevertheless, a table is empty of being a table since when its parts are examined no table can be found, likewise a car is found to be empty of a car since no car can be found when its parts are examined.

The emptiness of cars, tables and selves are alike inso far as the parts upon which cars, tables and selves are imputed are all equally found to be empty respectively of cars, tables and selves. In other words, no car can be found when its parts are examined, no table can be found when its parts are examined, no self can be found when its parts are examined, meaning that anything designated on parts is merely an empty designation with no underlying reality at all.

Interesting to read this thread and see what various teachings say is to be negated, or otherwise. In looking at all possible modes of existence/non-existence Buddha proffered no position at all. He never said one was right or the other wrong, or entered into any speculation. "A 'position,' Vaccha, is something that a Tathagata has done away with. What a Tathagata sees is this: 'Such is form, such its origination, such its disappearance;... ( http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka ... .than.html )
So a view which asserts two truths, one a non-existent "convention" and the other an existent "ultimate", is really saying "both exists and does not exist" - which was described by Buddha as not leading to "disenchantment, dispassion, cessation; to calm, direct knowledge, full Awakening, Unbinding."

I don't think that Buddha refused to engage with this or that view because he didn't like them or thought that they were not refined enough. The problem was in clinging to any kind of view.

Do not destroy conventionalities known to the world by saying that table is empty of table!

Malcolm wrote:
Candra says directly after the citation you produced:
How can that which does not exist through seven aspects, 
be said to exist? The existence of this will not be found by the yogin. 
Since he rests with ease in reality, 
here, the proposition of that [chariot, etc.] is also asserted. 
If the chariot is not real, at that time, 
nothing has parts, nor are there any parts. 
For example, just as when the chariot is burned there are no parts, 
the parts are [burned] when the possessor of parts is burned with the fire of intelligence.
So here, the reality is that tables, chariots, selves and so on are empty of themselves because they cannot withstand analysis, also their components cannot withstand analysis, and when subject to ultimate analysis they cannot be found. Nevertheless,

A table is precisely imputed on its parts which are empty of being "a table" — it is for this reason that tables are empty of being tables, since they are composed of parts upon which a table is imputed and in which a table will never be found.

When a convention is subject to analysis is it naturally destroyed in the process of analysis in just the same way that a hammer shatters a pot. If you interpret Candra the way you do, you disallow any ultimate analysis — but what Candra states is the following:
"Just a cart is designated in dependent on wheels and so on, wheels and so on are appropriated on that basis, but the chariot is not an appropriator, in the same way, because the self (a mundane convention that is not negated in relative truth), like a chariot, is asserted to be an appropriator."
Candra here makes an important point about all this — the chariot is not an actual appropriator, why? Because it is merely designated on some parts, a wheel and so on. Likewise the self is not a real appropriator because it is designation on some parts. Nevertheless, in terms of the mundane convention in the relative, we do not negate chariots, selves and so on, even though chariots, selves and so on are not real, being mere designations on the basis of some parts. But your mistake is to assume that a chariot is being designated a chariot on the basis of a chariot, and this is utterly wrong.

Candra continues:
The five aggregates, the six elements and the six sense bases are the appropriations of that self because a self is designated on the basis of the five aggregates and so on, just as the wheels and so are the appropriations of the chariot
The self is conventionally asserted to be an appropriator of karma, merit, aggregates and so on, because it is designated on the basis of the five aggregates. As we see above, however, there is actually no self that can act as an appropriator since such a self does not exist, being a mere imputation.

He then continues:
Just as this presentation of the appropriated and the appropriated is a presentation of mundane convention, likewise, it is explained "This action and agent is to be accepted like the chariot." The appropriated is the action, this also is the agent. The so-called "appropriated", the aggregates and so on are the action, and the self is presented as a so-called "agent." 

Because this is not real, this is not stable,
this is not unstable, this neither arises or perishes.
Here there is no permanence and so on, 
there is neither sameness nor difference. 

Though this self designated upon the aggregates is not stable, it is also not unstable. In that respect, if the self is unstable, at that time:
 
The appropriated are not the self,
those are produced and perish. 
How could the appropriated
turn into the appropriator? 

In the same way:

There is no production from the unproduced, 
for consequently there will be a fault here,
the self will either be a product
or will be produced without a cause. 

Thus, there is a contradiction with the śāstra. Because of that, if the aggregates are the self, if it comes to be possess arising and perishing, also it is not asserted as having arising or perishing. Therefore, the consequence that the aggregates "are not the self" will be valid. Because of that, the instability of this [self] is not valid, nor its stability.
Therefore, it is perfectly accurate to say that the self is empty of the self, chariots are empty of chariots, tables of empty of tables. What ever is designated on parts is empty of itself because it is mere designation that cannot be found upon analysis of the parts upon which it is designated. If it were only empty of inherent existence, then selves, chariots, tables and so on could be found in the basis of investigating their parts.

So what do I do?  Is it bad to attend? Do I just not participate in the empowerments then and sit there quietly when the time comes? Or since my intention is to go to broaden my learning and listen to great masters teach as a dzogchen practitoner, it is not considered "switching" since AGY is my practice that unifies everything?  I see many dzogchen practitioners signing up to go to other empowerments like I am about to do, so I thought it was normal?

On the other hand, this is a moot point, because all Tibetan Buddhists are Vajrayāna practitioners. However also in Mahayoga and Anuyoga Nubchen identifies a gradual and sudden approach, with the latter coming from Padmasambhava's man ngag lta ba phreng ba.

Would you care to clearly elucidate this view? If it involves abandoning conceptual minds because they are regarded as harmful then Hashang's view is wrong and even dangerous.

Malcolm wrote:
What Sherlock is saying is that in general, since the appearance of a history about the arrival of Śāntarakṣita and Padmasambhava to Tibet called the sba bzhed i.e., " The Narrative of Sba ",  sometime between the late 9th and early 12th century, many Tibetan scholars such as Sakya Pandita have held views about Chan Buddhism in general based on what is reported in that text.

Sherlock's point is that there is more than one report about the positions of Hashang Mahayana and in his opinion, those following the Narrative of Sba are giving consideration only to a very one sided point of view of Hashang's actual views, and that Hashang has become a strawman that Tibetan schools use to attack each other with.

In other words, what Sherlock is questioning is whether or not Sba gsal snang's reporting on Hashang's views are actually factual. Many modern scholars think the entire episode was entirely fabricated for political reasons.

Later Nyingmapa's have also expressed hostility at the Sba bzhed literature because it contradicts later terma biographies on many details, such as asserting that Padmasambhava was the actual son of the King of Oddiyāna and so on.

Of course the are some problems with Nubchen's account as well since he has Bodhidharma traveling to Tibet and arriving with one shoe in his hand.

I say although a table is empty of inherent existence, or is empty of being an inherently existent table, it is not empty of being a table.

But it is empty of being inherently existent [table] because it is not found by a mind of ultimate analysis.

You say a table is empty of being a table, do you not ?

Malcolm wrote:
Two problems here:

One, tables are empty of being tables. If tables were not empty being tables, conventional tables could withstand analysis, and so too could all things made of parts, such as persons. A table appears/exists, and a table is imputed on its parts, like persons, but it cannot be found to withstand ultimate analysis. In the process of analyzing a table, also the table ceases to be apprehended. This principle is well established even in lower tenet systems such as Abhidharma, where the cognition of a pot ceases the moment it is broken into shards, and so on.

Second, this perspective — that the appearance/existence of conventionally imputed tables can withstand ultimate analysis while their inherent existence cannot — makes it difficult to practice the creation stage, since our so called conventional valid cognition perceives impure appearances and not pure appearances of the mandala and so on. The latter requires training and purification.

The one endowed with this Dharma completely purifies in this life even the karma that results in birth in the three lowers realms through pain in the eye, ear, nose, tongue or a pain in the head, being afflicted by a pain in the limb or the heart, or being afflicted by a contagious disease, pain in the abdomen, or when traveling to other lands, being killed, bound, beaten, abused, struck, criticized or vision in a nightmare.

Plus, I've indicated a number of translations (such as ascertain, know, understand, and so forth) and since you know what rtogs pa is, we don't need to argue on the translation. It is exactly like the fact that there is no need to argue on the term of "compassion" when we know the Buddhist definition, function, divisions of it, on the pretext that its Latin etymology of it as to do with "to suffer with..."

Malcolm wrote:
The point is that the term rtogs renders any number of Sanskrit terms — in general in Tibetan "rtogs pa" actually means "understand" or "know" (shes pa). When it is used in the sense of "realize", it is being used in the sense of avabodha, but here it is not being used in that sense of avabodha.

A self-sufficient substantial entity would be an inherent existence, from our POV. But Tsongkhapa argues that is not the basis of negation, instead it is the inherent existence which is different than existence. From our point of view, existence is the coarse object of negation[...]

Malcolm wrote:
In fact, we say the basis is either phenomena or a person. The subtle object of negation is the same in both cases, though.
It doesn't matter, the subtle object of negation is not the actual object of negation in Madhyamaka, Candra only introduces it as a formality.

Unknown said:
Still, I don't understand what you mean by 'existence is the coarse object of negation'.

Malcolm wrote:
No one perceives inherent existence, which is a philosophical abstraction. People do perceive existence, and that is what is negated through Madhyamaka analysis because that is what people perceive. But negating existence is not enough, one must also negate nonexistence, both and neither. When one is an ārya, however, one does not need to proceed through the four-fold negation.

The Sakyas maintain that the difference between Bhavaviveka and Candra is pedagogical only.

Malcolm wrote:
Basically, what it amounts to is the very Chinese Buddhist idea, later widely adopted by Kagyus and Nyingmas, that there were very clear sets of sutras that could be distinguished by the turning to which they belong.

Nubchen asserts that Hashang depended on these definitive sutras, and that Kamashila depended on provisional sutras.
But here, Nubchen is showing evidence of influence from Chinese Buddhism. It is really nothing more profound than this.

This is fine, but the reality of it is that the Indians never gave any importance to idea of three turnings at all. I don't either, which is why I find Nubchen's notion that Hashang's teachings are higher than Kamalashila's based on which turning of wheel to which they supposedly adhere to be a completely bogus proposition, DOA. Understandable, but DOA. Accepting Nubchen's POV on this means accepting the distinction between the three turnings as understood in Chinese Buddhism and I simply do not think that is a particularly valid way of understanding sūtras.

narraboth said:
As a Chinese who started from Chinese Buddhism study, I don't think the idea of 'three turning of wheel' was that popular in our tradition. We do say 'five periods' based on Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra: 'Just like from the milk the yogurt is made, from yogurt the raw butter is made....'  However, it's not really about which period is superior in view. For example, the first period is âvataṃsaka period, the sutra is surely a Mahayana text, just Chinese suggested that it's direct and unrefined as fresh milk, not everyone can digest it.
We do have Sandhinirmocana Sūtra translated though, but I think it's more emphasized by Yogācāra school (in China) rather than Zen school. In Zen school, at least after Song dynasty, the most important sutra is Vajracchedikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra. So I am not sure if Chinese give three turnings much importance at all. My feeling as a Chinese is that TIbetan emphasize it more than anyone.

Malcolm wrote:
I am not saying it is popular in the Chinese tradition, I am saying that its source is Chinese.

The idea of ranking sutras in terms of provisionality and definitiveness comes primarily from the Chinese commentary in the Samdhinirmocana Sutra. Chinese Buddhism indeed has a number of schemes where the Buddha's teachings are ranked according to when he is supposed to gave taught them, but the source of the idea of three turnings of the wheel elaborated in this way is this commentary that I mentioned by Won-ch'uk, the 'phags pa dgongs pa zab mo nges par 'grel pa'i mdo rgya cher 'grel pa in three volumes. Since this concept is virtually absent from Indian sources, it must be from Chinese sources.

Scientifically there are no non-physical objects to investigate or establish a connection with. Otherwise the duality of mind and body in Buddhism is only a conventional term as all phenomena are within the experiential realm and distinguished as form and names as a way to talk about categories of experiences. If we begin to analyse such conventions in Buddhism then we gradually end up with mind-only and emptiness.

They are called material entities because they exhibit such properties and are experienced with the first five consciousnesses. Supposing a noumenal substance, independent object, beyond the phenomenal level is either a conventional approach or a substantialist philosophy.

Astus said:
They can happen only if conceived within a subjective experiential realm where one doesn't have to account for the conservation of mass and energy (small becomes big, one becomes many, etc.).

The common physical world is either substantially real or it is not. If it is not, then there should be no problem accepting such things as iddhi-patis even if they do not normally conform to conventional expectations of 20th century humans. There are certainly plenty of anecdotal evidence of yogis who leave their footprints and handprints in rocks and so on in the HImalayas and certainly plenty of people, even westerners who have observed such events. It is rank substantialism to claim that such events are impossible because some imputed "general laws of this physical reality."

But despite all these things, you have no provided any reason at all that suggests that your acceptance of rebirth is rational and your rejection of iddhi-patis and so on is also rational. Your acceptance of former is actually irrational because you reject the latter.
I do not reject supernormal powers. What I find problematic is the idea that they exist within the physical context.

Malcolm wrote:
Right, and you have this problem because you have realist tendencies, not unlike Sarvastivadins. The abhijñas are one thing, of course these are mental abilities, the iddhi-pattis/siddhis are something else again, they are not just mental abilities, though they come from having developed powers over the mind, having done so, they lend the ability to have power over matter, which according what you state above, is either a convention or mind-only.

Other than exchanging "Milarepa flying from point A to point B" with "rebirth" or "karma" and "ignorant" with "wrong view", I'm not sure where we part ways here.

Both groups believe that their respective sources are the ultimate and final authority, both groups believe that what is in those sources is literally true, and both groups believe that one should reorganize their lives based upon what is in their respective sources upon pain of horrible consequences(really the only difference between Avici Hell and the Christian Hell is that Avici is almost eternal but the Christian Hell is eternal).  With that said, I do freely admit that BA Christianity is evangelical(meaning there is a drive to convert others), while Buddhadharma is most definitely not.

It is not fundamentalist thing — it is about accurately understanding what the Buddha taught and then deciding whether or not one can accept what he taught. If you can't, than please do not try to twist the Buddha's teachings into something that corresponds with your prejudices.

Further, "Buddhisms" tend to focus on one aspect of Buddha's teachings, they can never encompass the whole of it. I am a Tibetan Buddhist because I follow that path and system, but there is more to Buddhadharma than Tibetan Buddhism, there is Chan, Pure Land, etc. Sometimes "Buddhisms" are distortions of the Buddha's teachings, like Secular Buddhism and so on.

The consensus has come down this: in order for there to be an order of nuns in Tibetan Buddhism, they must receive a living lineage from other nuns. Luckily, this still exists in Chinese Buddhism, in the Dharmaguptaka order. The main difficulty here is that these nuns are not and never will be Mulasarvastivadin nuns. But on the face of it, that is not what these women care about (i.e. which order into which they are ordained), they want to be bhikṣunis.

I have a question about how Madhyamakavatara 6.36 is understood. It reads:
Reasonings prove that arising from self and other
Are illogical in suchness.
Since they also prove that arising is illogical conventionally,
On what basis do you speak of “arising”?
But if arising is refuted conventionally as well as ultimately, how should this be understood to avoid refuting dependent arisings on the level of appearances? I am particularly interested as to how this passage is understood outside of Gelug, especially according to the understanding of Gorampa.

I would like to note here before anything else that I'm not asking this as a polemic and I certainly don't want this to turn into a debate thread about whether Gorampa or anyone else is right or wrong. I'm just trying to grow in understanding here.

To me it seems that the text requires some kind of qualification, but I can't see how the text can really be qualified without doing serious violence to the plain meaning of the text.

A self-sufficient substantial entity would be an inherent existence, from our POV. But Tsongkhapa argues that is not the basis of negation, instead it is the inherent existence which is different than existence. From our point of view, existence is the coarse object of negation, and that is what is negated in Madhyamaka analysis generally, it, non-existence, both and neither in that order, unless one is an ārya, then one can dispense with the turn by turn negation of the four extremes. The purpose of negating the third extreme is not made irrelevant because it is double negation, as Tsongkhapa argues, but simply because there are those such as Jains and so on who maintain that there are things that are both existence and non-existent.

Mahayoga is of course superior to sutra but Chan (at least 9th century Chan) is actually a superior mode of practice to Kamalashila's way even if their view of the ultimate was the same.

The gradual Mahayana path's meditation is pretty similar to Hinayana with the addition of bodhicitta motivation?

But in any case, non-Nyingmapas have maligned Hashang for centuries without really studying his view, this should stop.

Malcolm wrote:
You cannot really say that Hashang's method of practice is superior. Does Hashang's method mean that the three incalculable eons for practicing the bodhisattva path are not necessary or bypassed? If your answer is no, then how is it superior since the path in general is still gathering the gradual accumulations of merit and wisdom through the six perfections? It turns out to be a mere rhetorical superiority. If your answer is yes, than what is the use of Vajrayāna?

Gradual Mahāyāna is nothing like Hinayāna — why would you say such a thing? Have you never studied the Sutrālamkāra, Ratnavali, etc.?

Tenzin Dorje said:
Still, to come back to our topic, Je Tsongkhapa asserts that a wrong consciousness realizes its own appearing object. For instance, ignorance realizes not inherent existence (because it is a non-existent and a non-existent can not be realized) but the appearance of inherent. The appearance of inherent existence is the appearing object of ignorance (a wrong consciousness and a conceptual consciousness). As to whether ignorance has a conceived object, it is not clear, but if it has so, it is a terminological division of 'conceived object' because it is non-existent.

According to Tsongkhapa, and that's where it becomes interesting, others schools (including Svatantrika-Madhyamikas) can not properly answer the question "what does ignorance realize ?" because it can not realize a non-existent such as inherent existence, where he answers "it realizes its own appearing object, the appearance of inherent existence". It is indeed Tsongkhapa's understanding that a unique tenet of Prasangika is that 'a wrong consciousness realizes its own appearing object, and is valid in regard to it'.

Malcolm wrote:
Not sure what Tibetan term you mean by "realize", so your point is rather obscure to me because of it.

Tenzin Dorje said:
In this way also, the omniscient mind of a Buddha directly realizes the appearance of inherent existence that is in the continuum of sentient beings. This shows it directly realizes mental images that are the appearing objects of conceptual consciousnesses in the continuum of sentient beings. Now, as you pointed out, I don't know whether Prasangika appart from Tsongkhapa would hold this. I leave that up to you, and it'll make the 'debate' interesting

Malcolm wrote:
In general, the response is that sentient beings do not differentiate between existence and inherent existence. Because this is so, while it is true that Candrakīrit indeed identifies a subtle object of negation, inherent existence, the actual object of negation is the course object of negation, existence, because that is what sentient beings actually perceive and are actually deluded by.

Also, the problem with Tsongkhapa's hermeneutics here involve the fact that he is basically stating that while buddhas have no conceptual apprehension of their own, they apprehend the conceptual apprehensions of sentient beings, and that seems like a very strange position. The general position of Candrakirti seems to be:
The peaceful kāya manifests like a wishfulfilling tree, 
is nonconceptual like a wishfulfilling gem, 
always existing for the benefit of the world until migrating beings are liberated, 
this [kāya] appears free of proliferation
Meaning it is not necessary for buddhas to apprehend the concepts of sentient beings since they act effortlessly without concepts on the behalf of sentient beings like wishfulfilling gems and so on.

The term parabhāva = dependent existence. The term pratītyasamutpāda = dependent origination.
Candra's definition of dependent origination, "...production through the meeting such and such an assembly of causes and conditions is what is called "dependent origination."

Sherab said:
I was expecting more than just definitions as a response to my request for you to elaborate on your objection.

My argument is really quite straightforward.

Assume in the simpliest of case that B arise from A.  The process of B arising from A is dependent origination.  Because of B arising from A, the existence of B is a dependent existence.

What I am arguing here is that dependent existence is inextricably linked to dependent origination.  Dependent existence has no meaning without dependent origination in the context of the discussion of my objection to infinitely regressive causal chain.

Continuing with the simple example of B arising from A:
(1) dependent existence per Nagarjuna -  Inherent existent S -> T -> U -> V -> W -> X -> Y -> Z -> A -> B   (simple causal chain with an inherently existing S as the beginning)
(2) infinitely regressive dependent existence -               <no beginning> ............. -> X ->Y -> Z -> A -> B  (simple causal chain without beginning)

Note that in causal chain (2) there is no inherent existence anywhere in the chain.  That is why it is different from causal chain (1) which starts off with an inherent existence, or in your own words, an unconditioned cause.

As a reminder, I have no problem with dependent existence per Nagarjuna.  I have problem with infinitely regressive dependent existence.

Unless existence in the tetralemma is defined to cover inherent existence, dependent existence per Nagarjuna AND dependent existence from a beginningless causal chain, there is no true freedom from extremes.

Nagarjuna's definition of existence excludes dependent existence from a beginningless causal chain and since you follow Nagarjuna's definition of existence, the extreme of dependent existence from a beginningless causal chain is not negated.

Did the Buddha negate the extreme of dependent existence from a beginningless causal chain?  Yes.  But you cannot do this with the tetralemma if the definition of existence excludes dependent existence from a beginningless causal chain.

Malcolm wrote:
You apparently choose to ignore Nāhārjuna's statement, "Where is there an existence not included in inherent existence or dependent existence (another species of inherent existence)."

The process of b arising from a is not dependent origination. There are no single causes in the chain of dependent origination, which is why dependent existence is rejected by Nāgārjuna as species of inherent existence. Dependent origination means arising from a combination of causes and conditions. For example, a sprout arises not merely from a seed, but from soil, moisture, warmth and so on.

The point is that Nāgārjuna is rejecting dependent existence in favor of dependent origination. I really do not see why it is so hard for you to understand this. Since we are just going around in circles, I am going to stop this here. I won't respond to this thread anymore.

Since Goramapa lists more than 150 points of contention with Tsongkhapa's presentation of Prasangika Madhyamaka, it is really much better if you qualify your presentation with Tsonkhapa's interpretation since many of his unique interpretations are unknown to Indians as well as Tibetans. I understand that devotees of Tsongkhapa consider this to be a feature, whereas detractors of Tsongkhapa consider these innovations to be bugs in his view.

I myself am not expert enough in Tsongkhapa's writings to say much about them with certainty, but in general, I have personally found Goramapa's criticisms of Tsongkhapa's views regarding sūtra and tantra well founded.

Mahāprajāpatī Bhikṣuni Sūtra: "Ānanda further asked the Buddha, 'Is it then permissible for a bhikṣu to act as a master [to a bhikṣuṇī]?' The Buddha said, 'No. It should be that a great bhikṣuṇī acts as master. If there are no bhikṣuṇīs, then the bhikṣu sangha is permitted [to carry out the ordination].'”
Elsewhere in the Chinese canon the following convention is established:
《沙彌尼離戒文》:「佛告諸弟子：汝慎莫妄度沙彌離，女人姿態難保悅，在須臾以復更生惡意，……自非菩薩、阿羅漢，不可度尼。」

Sūtra on Śrāmaṇerī Precepts (沙彌尼離戒文):“The Buddha spoke to the disciples, 'You must be careful not to carelessly ordain śrāmaṇerī -s. It is difficult to guard against delighting in a woman's charming presence. In a moment one will further produce unwholesome thoughts. … If one is not a bodhisattva or arhat, ordination of nuns may not be carried out.'”
Thus it is understood in the absence of any living lineage of bhikṣuṇīs, a bhikṣu has the right to ordain new bhikṣuṇīs, but the presiding preceptor should be a bodhisattva or arhat.

I believe a similar understanding exists in Theravada, which legitimized Ajahn Brahm's decision to ordain bhikkunis despite protests from the Thai sangha.
