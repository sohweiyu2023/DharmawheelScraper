We must purify ourselves before the gods will accept our offering. This is likely based on the ancient nomadic Tibetan custom of having visitors to one's camp pass through juniper smoke (to prevent communicable diseases) before they are offered repast.

This is held true for the six active consciousnesses, not the other two (i.e. they are not actually aware). The role of manas and citta is to maintain the continuity of afflictions when the six active consciousnesses cease. While the extra parts are said to serve as a bridge, it is also maintained that the seeds, just as the storehouse, are momentary. So, if there is no problem with the alayavijnana ceasing every moment, why is it a problem with the six active consciousnesses? And because the alayavijnana is unconscious and momentary, the very theory of it is problematic and redundant.

That's a fairly big cost which would have to be borne, in the end by the consumers.

Taxis, delivery trucks, buses, etc, that are on the road for hours every day would get a bigger advantage from the reduced recharge time. We will see what happens.

It is a debatable point that is addressed in the Kathavatthu (VIII.8, XVI.9) and refuted, i.e. the arupaloka cannot contain rupa, i.e. matter.

"You can predicate them truly of the Rupa-sphere, where there yet is matter. But this sphere is not identical with the Arupa-sphere. And if you predicate matter of the Arupa-sphere, you must show that matter agrees with the description you can truly give of the Arupa-sphere as a state of existence, a destiny, etc."

They may not be, but putting a name on either one doesn't help to give one the experience of it. By your own admission, you say that there is no common word for Rigpa that Dzogchen translators agree upon. I think at best, we get a concept of what is meant by the word, but that is not the actual experience of it.

Malcolm wrote:
There may be no common agreement on what the word rig pa means among some translators, but the commentarial literature is extremely clear on what the word means— it means "knowledge" in general, and specifically, knowledge of the essence. The reason it is best not to use the term "knowledge"  in Dzogchen translations, is that the term "knowledge" in English attenuates the meaning too narrowly. Rig pa is a knowledge, but it is a very special kind of knowledge. Rig by it self some cases in Dzogchen texts means "knowing," as in the phrase shes zhing rig, i.e. "consciousness and knowing," or one could say, "conscious and aware." But it never means the noun, "awareness." And commonly in its verbal form, rig bya, it means literally, "one should know."

The experiential knowledge indicated in Dzogchen by the term rig pa cannot be discovered independently, it can only be discovered on the basis of a teacher's intimate instruction. Those who disagree simply do not understand rig pa is in Dzogchen.

In case anyone continues to harbor doubt that rig pa should be understood as knowledge, Longchenpa clearly states in the Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle:
The definition of rig pa: the knowledge (rig pa) gained through the guru’s instructions which was formerly unknown (ma rig pa) is rig pa.
BTW, if something is not different from something, that makes it intrinsic. For example, water is intrinsically wet.

I'm wondering if anyone can shed some additional light on what is meant by a Buddha being "omniscient". Is it an accurate translation, and is there any specificity describing what exactly a Buddha can know? Presumably every possible thing, if the term is accurately translated. And considering the number of times the sentence "I can't know your level of realization because I'm not enlightened" is written on this board, at least some level of literal omniscience seems to be implied.

Looking from early teachings attributed to The Buddha, all the way to recent masters, it is clear that highly revered beings don't truly know everything, in the sense that there are teachings about the world being flat, or large misunderstandings about how disease works, or that no one spoke to whether bacteria are sentient (and for the sake of this conversation, we have to assume these were not skillful lies/omissions).

So, are the teachings about Buddhas being literally omniscient false, or is it used in a different sense?

Donald Trump Is a Menace to the World: Opinion - SPIEGEL ONLINE

Donald Trump is not fit to be president of the United States. He does not possess the requisite intellect and does not understand the significance of the office he holds nor the tasks associated with it. He doesn't read. He doesn't bother to peruse important files and intelligence reports and knows little about the issues that he has identified as his priorities. His decisions are capricious and they are delivered in the form of tyrannical decrees.

He is a man free of morals. As has been demonstrated hundreds of times, he is a liar, a racist and a cheat. I feel ashamed to use these words, as sharp and loud as they are. But if they apply to anyone, they apply to Trump. And one of the media's tasks is to continue telling things as they are: Trump has to be removed from the White House. Quickly. He is a danger to the world.

Trump is a miserable politician. He fired the FBI director simply because he could. James Comey had gotten under his skin with his investigation into Trump's confidants. Comey had also refused to swear loyalty and fealty to Trump and to abandon the investigation. He had to go.

Witnessing an American Tragedy

Trump is also a miserable boss. His people invent excuses for him and lie on his behalf because they have to, but then Trump wakes up and posts tweets that contradict what they have said. He doesn't care that his spokesman, his secretary of state and his national security adviser had just denied that the president had handed Russia (of all countries) sensitive intelligence gleaned from Israel (of all countries). Trump tweeted: Yes, yes, I did, because I can. I'm president after all.

Nothing is as it should be in this White House. Everyone working there has been compromised multiple times and now they all despise each other - and everyone except for Trump despises Trump. Because of all that, after just 120 days of the Trump administration, we are witness to an American tragedy for which there are five theoretical solutions.

The first is Trump's resignation, which won't happen. The second is that Republicans in the House and Senate support impeachment, which would be justified by the president's proven obstruction of justice, but won't happen because of the Republicans' thirst for power, which they won't willingly give up. The third possible solution is the invocation of the 25th Amendment, which would require the cabinet to declare Trump unfit to discharge the powers of the presidency. That isn't particularly likely either. Fourth: The Democrats get ready to fight and win back majorities in the House and Senate in midterm elections, which are 18 months away, before they then pursue option two, impeachment. Fifth: the international community wakes up and finds a way to circumvent the White House and free itself of its dependence on the U.S. Unlike the preceding four options, the fifth doesn't directly solve the Trump problem, but it is nevertheless necessary - and possible.

No Goals and No Strategy

Not quite two weeks ago, a number of experts and politicians focused on foreign policy met in Washington at the invitation of the Munich Security Conference. It wasn't difficult to sense the atmosphere of chaos and agony that has descended upon the city.

The U.S. elected a laughing stock to the presidency and has now made itself dependent on a joke of a man. The country is, as David Brooks wrote recently in the New York Times, dependent on a child. The Trump administration has no foreign policy because Trump has consistently promised American withdrawal while invoking America's strength. He has promised both no wars and more wars. He makes decisions according to his mood, with no strategic coherence or tactical logic. Moscow and Beijing are laughing at America. Elsewhere, people are worried.

In the Pacific, warships - American and Chinese - circle each other in close proximity. The conflict with North Korea is escalating. Who can be certain that Donald Trump won't risk nuclear war simply to save his own skin? Efforts to stop climate change are in trouble and many expect the U.S. to withdraw from the Paris Agreement because Trump is wary of legally binding measures. Crises, including those in Syria and Libya, are escalating, but no longer being discussed. And who should they be discussed with? Phone calls and emails to the U.S. State Department go unanswered. Nothing is regulated, nothing is stable and the trans-Atlantic relationship hardly exists anymore. German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel and Bundestag Foreign Affairs Committee Chair Norbert Röttgen fly back and forth, but Germany and the U.S. no longer understand each other. Hardly any real communication takes place, there are no joint foreign policy goals and there is no strategy.

In "Game of Thrones," the Mad King was murdered (and the child that later took his place was no better). In real life, an immature boy sits on the throne of the most important country in the world. He could, at any time, issue a catastrophic order that would immediately be carried out. That is why the parents cannot afford to take their eyes off him even for a second. They cannot succumb to exhaustion because he is so taxing. They ultimately have to send him to his room - and return power to the grownups.

If a teacher is truly realized, isn't it all Dharma? Or at least it should be, no? I think reconciling those--at times conflicting--views can be difficult.

OK, so ye shes really is closer to "pristine consciousness"/"primordial consciousness"/etc rather than "wisdom".

Understanding this point, helped me resolve some doubts. Wisdom in English, especially in historical usage, was often used to translate/mean Latin "prudentia" or Greek "phronesis", both of which indicate decision-making, quite different from ye shes. In the Havamal, purported to be the words of Odin, Odin also says it is better for a man to be "middling wise" in the sense of not being overly learned nor too uneducated. Again this historical use of "wise"/"wisdom" is quite distant from ye shes.

If you have been around the block, Ray's contribution is not "great;" anyone who teaches anything to do with Vajrayāna must by definition frame these things with reference to the body. For example, in the very first teaching on Vajrayāna I ever received from HHST, he made it very clear that the main difference between Vajrayāna and other forms of Buddhism was our emphasis on methods connected with the body which are wholly absent in sūtra. This is why we have yantra yoga, prāṇāyama, and so on in Vajrayāna.

Secondly, the first foundation of mindfulness is the foundation of mindfulness of the body, so one cannot maintain that paths of renunciation neglect the body either.

The reality is that since the body culture of India and Tibet was only come to us in fragments and dribs and drabs, quite often people overlook the vast literature on physical cultural, health, and illness that exists in these traditions, or because of biomedical prejudice, ignore it.

He even goes as far as calling this 'True Self'. Of course, we immediately think of Advaita and it's posit of an atman as true self. This kind of conception is not very different from each other, and the Buddha lived in a time where this kind of teaching must have been prevalent. Buddhist scholars have argued this point of 'positive' essence vehemently, both for and against this kind of thinking. How do you personally interpret this? Is it just semantics that we get lost in and both systems are talking about the 'ineffable' using different terms? What would the difference between Brahman and buddhanature really be?

krodha said:
The term "true self" [satyātman] actually never appears in any of the tathāgatagarbha sūtras. It's presence in select English texts is a translational gloss chosen by a couple authors to fit their own biases.

Further, the Laṅkāvatāra is explicitly clear that the tathāgatagarbha is not to be conflated with the self of the non-buddhists.

The Laṅkā also states:

O Mahāmati, with a view to casting aside the heterodox theory, you must treat the tathāgatagarbha as not self [anātman].

Bhāviveka demonstrates the proper way to view buddhanature:

The statement "The tathāgata pervades" means wisdom pervades all objects of knowledge, but it does not mean abiding in everything like Viśnu. Further, "Tathāgatagarbhin" means emptiness, signlessness and absence of aspiration exist the continuums of all sentient beings, but is not an inner personal agent pervading everyone.

He does indeed say what he means by Advaita. He is a student of Poonja-ji, like Andrew Cohen, Ganga-ji, Mooji and so on. Thus, we have a very clear idea of what Advaita means for him.

He also paints a very clear picture of what Dzogchen means for him. This is one of the reasons why I characterized his description of Dzogchen as Vipassana gussied up in Tibetan drag.

He describes his religious career very precisely: He first practiced Burmese-style Vipassana; he then went on to study with Poonja-ji, and then he spent a few years (5) taking teachings from Tulku Urgyen.

His book is entitled, "Waking Up: A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion." In this book he describes his view of religion in general, and Advaita and Dzogchen very thoroghly.

Now, as for myself, I really do not have anything more to offer on the subject of this book, other than that as a "purist," someone who has devoted to the past 25 years of my life to studying and practicing Dzogchen, I do not think these sorts of popularizations of the teachings do anything more than confuse people. People are very influenced by the first book they read on a given subject, and it pains me to think that the first book someone might read on the subject of Dzogchen teachings is Harris's book.

But the word in fact means "knowledge," and in the context of Dzgchen it means knowledge of your own nature.

No, these days EPK leaves it untranslated because apart from a few holdouts, everyone agrees "awareness" is not the right word for " rig pa."


The problems with translations of terms is that the field shifts more rapidly than we can reedit earlier work to reflect advances in our knowledge. Like deprecated or legacy code which has a large install base and is hard to upgrade, deprecated translations have a very long half-life, and people resist upgrading their terms. But the reason why deprecated code is deprecated is that it causes errors in computation. Likewise, legacy translations can cause errors in understanding. For example, many times you see texts translating rlung as prāṇa, when in fact rlung is a translation of vāyu. Prāṇa is properly translated into Tibetan as srog, life, and prāṇavāyu is translated as srog 'dzin rlung, lit., "the wind that sustains life." But over and over again we see people using the term prāṇa to refer to the five vāyus. This inaccuracy is a holdover from the introduction of Yoga to the West, from which these terms were first introduced.

Thus, students also have to keep up with the times, and when there is a major shift in how this or that term is understood, they have to shift with it.

When it comes to clarity, however, clarity in Dzogchen is not a cognitive faculty. A commentary on the Blazing Lamp Tantra clarifies perfectly that the clarity discussed in Dzogchen is not the the clarity found in the three realms, but is rather clarity ( gsal ba ) in Dzogchen means zang thal, pellucidity, or 'od gsal ba, luminosity.

Finally, the point is not to make one person right and another person wrong. This is like science. When the facts change, we change accordingly.

The mind essence is unconditioned, empty clarity. The mind is conditioned. A person who has directly perceived their own mind essence is someone who has rig pa, knowledge.

The mind essence is not cognizant, however, any more than a mirror is cognizant of the reflections on its surface.

For example, to use a metaphor Norbu Rinpoche frequently employs for making people understand clarity, when you look at a vista and swiftly move your head from one side to the other, all of the impressions on your sense organ of the eyes (in this example) are part of your clarity, but one has no awareness or cognizance of any object within that field. If you recognize something in that field and pick it out, that is mind, not clarity.

"Cognizant" (meaning to know of or be aware of something, ) means that one must have something to be cognizant of. It's built into the way the word is used in our language. You never use the verb without "of" being appended to it.

Dzogchen does not seek a "dualistic" consciousness, because consciousness is always dualistic. It is always with concepts.

Dzogchen and Mahāmudra seek to identify the so called mind-essence. This teaching  does not exist in Advaita, and there is nothing remotely like it in that system. There is therefore no way that one can say that Dzogchen and Advaita seek to provoke the same insight. This is why I pointed out that Dzogchen rejects Yogācāra, because indeed, Yogācāra is predicated on seeking a nondual consciousness.

It is an error to dismiss the fact that the underlying view of Dzogchen teachings is emptiness, whereas the underlying view of Advaita is a truly existing yet featureless consciousness called "brahmin."

The insight provoked in Dzogchen couldn't be further away from Advaita.

Are you suggesting that dzogchen does not seek to provoke insight into the nonduality of consciousness?

Malcolm wrote:
Yogācāra already offers insights into the nonduality of consciousness. Indeed, that is the point of the whole school.

Since Dzogchen rejects Yogācāra insights ( i.e. a Buddhist nondual realism) concerning the nonduality of consciousness, why would it accept Advaita (i.e. a non-Buddhist nondual eternalism) presentations concerning the nonduality of consciousness?  Dzogchen texts and teachings take explicit pains to differentiate themselves from non-Buddhist schools such as Saṃkhya, Vedanta and so on, as well as Yogācāra and so on. Mañjuśrīmitra takes pains to explain why Dzogchen and Yogācāra are not commensurate views. So does Rongzom, so does Longchenpa, etc.

More importantly, he makes a gross error in asserting that Dzogchen and Advaita seeks to provoke the same insight. Nothing could be further from the truth.

I also expect you will now withdraw your claim, "He explicitly and repeatedly does NOT equate advaita with dzogchen," because he repeatedly and explicitly does.

Absolute nonsense. You completely disregard everything Harris says on the subject. He very carefully explains the process of acquiring the "knowledge" of dzogchen using numerous metaphors and examples of pointing out instructions. He, very carefully shows how dzogchen is different and indeed in opposition to shamata and vipassana and other techniques that take objects, gross or subtle, as the focus of concentration.

I would sincerely recommend anyone on this board to read or listen to his book, available free as part of an Audible trial. I feel Harris explains dzogchen with greater clarity than many dzogchen teachers, Tibetan or western.

Sources further say that the Supreme Court notified Mr. Trump that the formal process of a case of impeachment against him was begun, before he departed the country on Air Force One. The notification was given, as part of the formal process of the matter, in order that Mr. Trump knew he was not able to use his powers of pardon against other suspects in Trump-Russia cases.

I think this thread has gone off topic in discussing zen but also in discussing the definition of rigpa. I think it is clear that Harris, and others that talk about awareness, not as a translation of rigpa, but as a feature of the ground. Phrases like open awareness, empty cognisance, non-dual awareness, etc. are used as terms for mind's nature not knowledge of it.

Malcolm wrote:
Harris uses awareness for rigpa. Waking Up, pg. 134:
"The Dzogchen master must precipitate an insight on the basis of which a student can thereafter practice a form of awareness (Tibetan: rigpa) that is unencumbered by subject/object dualism."
This point of view does not go beyond Yogacara. Yogācāra is great, but let's not confuse it with Dzogchen.

michaelb said:
I disagree. Rigpa is the insight the Dzogchen master must precipitate. I concede, like many others, Harris uses awareness to refer to different things, (confused awareness, concentrated meditative states, knowledge of the ground, etc.) his main use of awareness, arguably like Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche, is of awareness as the ground, the cognisant aspect of non-dual awareness.
I think you have got tied up with this because most use terms like awareness to refer to different things and mostly, when talking about dzogchen, they are talking about sem nyid not rigpa.


Malcolm wrote:
"... practice a form of awareness (Tibetan: rigpa) that is unencumbered by subject/object dualism"

There is a very great misunderstanding that has arisen around the so called "transmission days." Originally they were anniversaries where the DC would gather every where in the world at the same time to do a practice related to that days anniversary.

Then, sometime in the late 90's, ChNN came up with the idea of doing remote transmissions guided by video tape. This was soon replaced by webcast transmissions.

But if you have not at least listened to ChNN intro to Dzogchen talks and so on, it is unlikely you will be properly prepared to receive transmission. So many people attend these webcast transmissions, but not understanding the real principle, they remain confused through no fault of their own.

Hello every one. I've been browsing this board since I found it recently and haven't been able to find a concern I've been having in any other thread, so thought I'd register and ask.

I've been chasing after the dzogchen experience for some time now and earlier this year I watched a webcast with Chogyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche where he introduced rigpa through a guru yoga of Garab Dorje. I keep reading over and over that the introduction is to introduce you to the state of rigpa, and then afterwards you work with integrating what you were introduced to. It just so happens that I did not recognize anything (at least consciously) during the introduction, so I'm unsure how to work with meditating on something I had no recognition of in the first place. I paid full attention during the retreat and followed along closely with the visualizations and recitations. Am I just not a suitable candidate for Dzogchen?

What is the course of action I should take here, if any? If any one has any thoughts on this I'm all ears.

Thanks.


Malcolm wrote:
You do not understand the principle of the three transmissions, it seems. ChNN describes them very precisely on page-15-17 of the Song of the Vajra book.

In essence, a teacher communicates with words and symbols in order to generate an understanding of the meaning of the Great Perfection in the students mind. If you do not have an understanding of the verbal and symbolic transmissions, there is no way you will enter into direct transmission. The direct transmission means being in the same state of knowledge as the teacher at the same time. This is why ChNN, when he gives retreats, explains the meaning of the direct introduction through words and symbols before he gives it. If you do not have a conceptual understanding of the meaning of Dzogchen going into direct introduction, you may not recognize what is being pointed out during transmission. He says:

Chogyal Namkahai Norbu said:
The third method, direct transmisison, implies that one already has the knowledge of the oral and symbolic transmissions. Through these two, one has an idea of how to enter the real nature; then by using different experiences together, and by entering into that real nature at the same moment as the teacher, there is the possibility that one also receives direct transmission. So direct transmission implies the the possibility of receiving knowledge, when the student already knows how to work while the teacher transmits that knowledge.

As my teacher used to say, that person who sought liberation is gone. All questions regarding statements like samadhi and awakening are only relevant to that person who was the seeker. The question of how do you know is not relevant and never comes up. There is no movement to pose and answer these questions. Only when there is self do these questions get asked.

Because you believe in the system you follow, every experience is going to be filtered through this model. This is the thing that has to stop, IMO. It is a form of grasping and shows that the comparative mind is still dominant. It is nothing more than an intellectual exercise that we think is 'sacred'. Every thing you do revolves around your sense of self. If that ever stops, really stops, let me know. I will be the first in line to wai to you.

From "Moonbeams of Mahamudra" by Treleg R. introduction:
(The erratic capitalization is from the book.) It is important to understand that this Mahamudra system goes beyond Tantra. The text contains a discussion on the relationship between Tantra and Mahamudra but Mahamudra is not confined to conventional tantra practices. The goal of all higher tantric practices is to realize mahamudra, but Mahamudra meditation is a distinct meditative system. Conventional tantra practices include visualizations of deitites, mantra recitation, ritual practices, chanting, and so on. Not so in Mahamudra meditation. Mahamudra does not rely on any of these things or even regard them as important. We can practice Mahamudra without practicing Tantra or we can practice it in conjunctions with Tantra, but the Mahamudra system as presented in this manual is a complete and distinct practice in its own right.
I just wanted to make the point that Dzogchen does not monopolize this kind of approach.

No, because their fundamental confusion will interfere with the meaning of the view pointed out during empowerment. Of course, if through practicing they abandoned this confused idea well then, no problem.

It is not the same with respect to Yogacara and Madhyamaka. Both advocate emptiness as correct view.

Boomerang said:
Alright, if I'm understanding this correctly, there are multiple views of reality. The ultimate view is the tantric view. Below that, there are various sutra mahayana views. All of these are okay for receiving empowerment. Below that there are non-Buddhist views of reality, and these interfere with empowerment such that attaining Buddhahood is impossible. However, even if one receives empowerment while holding a confused view, they can grow out of it through practicing, and then they can become a Buddha.

Is all of that correct?


Malcolm wrote:
The view gained through empowerment/direct introduction is experiential. The views of sūtra are analytical (bracketing Chan/Zen here).

In sutrayāna, it is important that one's view in equipoise and post-equipoise match. It is for this reason that Madhyamakas such as Candrakīrti assert one cannot attain the path of seeing via Yogācāra. This is because one's view in equipoise is a product of analysis.

If one faithfully practices the methods of sadhana, however, the method itself familiarizes one with the experiential view gained in empowerment that corresponds with the correct view arrived at in sūtrayāna equipoise. Then, it does not matter whether you advocate Yogācāra or Madhyamaka, since both are within the general rubric of Mahāyāna and emphasize the two-fold emptiness.

With respect to that, even if you hold very wrong views, such Advaita, Samkhya, and so on, theoretically cultivation of sadhana methods of the Buddha can help you overcome these views through the development of the two accumulations. But if for example, one still believes in purusha or brahmin as an ultimate self/principle, then you will not make much progress in your practice beyond accumulation merit for a better rebirth, as well as having made a solid connection with a Buddhist guru.

There is however one other slight problem with thinking you can hold Hindu views while practicing Buddhist Vajrayāna sadhana —— it is a breakage of samaya to abandon the view of emptiness free from extremes. So there is that as well.

Malcolm wrote:
This particular chod is grounded in Dzogchen. All you need to practice this chod is direct introduction, ala, first phrase of Garab Dorje.

Of course you also need the lung for the practice, but you certainly do not need to receive any kind of empowerment, including "the opening of the sky door." Having said that, it is not a fault to receive Dechen Gyalmo, etc. It just isn't necessary.

This of course has a lot to do with a difference in perspective about empowerments from an Ati point of view and a Maha or Anuyoga point of view.

Malcolm wrote:
The term in Pali is Abhiññā:

Abhiññā1 (f.) [fr. abhi + jñā, see jānāti]. Rare in the older texts. It appears in two contexts. Firstly, certain conditions are said to conduce (inter alia) to serenity, to special knowledge (abhiññā), to special wisdom, and to Nibbāna. These conditions precedent are the Path (S v.421 = Vin i.10 = S iv.331), the Path + best knowledge and full emancipation (A v.238), the Four Applications of Mindfulness (S v.179) and the Four Steps to Iddhi (S. v.255). The contrary is three times stated; wrong -- doing, priestly superstitions, and vain speculation do not conduce to abhiññā and the rest (D iii.131; A iii.325 sq. and v.216). Secondly, we find a list of what might now be called psychic powers. It gives us 1, Iddhi (cp. levitation); 2, the Heavenly Ear (cp. clairaudience); 3, knowing others' thoughts (cp. thought -- reading); 4, recollecting one's previous births; 5, knowing other people's rebirths; 6, certainty of emancipation already attained (cp. final assurance). This list occurs only at D iii.281 as a list of abhiññās. It stands there in a sort of index of principal subjects appended at the end of the Dīgha, and belongs therefore to the very close of the Nikāya period. But it is based on older material. Descriptions of each of the six, not called abhiññā's, and interspersed by expository sentences or paragraphs, are found at D i.89 sq. (trsl. Dial. i.89 sq.); M i.34 (see Buddh. Suttas, 210 sq.); A i.255, 258 = iii.17, 280 = iv.421. At S i.191; Vin ii.16; Pug 14, we have the adj. chaḷabhiññā ("endowed with the 6 Apperceptions"). At S ii.216 we have five, and at S v.282, 290 six abhiññā's mentioned in glosses to the text. And at S ii.217, 222 a bhikkhu claims the 6 powers. See also M ii.11; iii.96. It is from these passages that the list at D iii. has been made up, and called abhiññā's.

Afterwards the use of the word becomes stereotyped. In the Old Commentaries (in the Canon), in the later ones (of the 5th cent. a.d.), and in medieval and modern Pāli, abhiññā, nine times out ten, means just the powers given in this list. Here and there we find glimpses of the older, wider meaning of special, supernormal power of apperception and knowledge to be acquired by long training in life aud thought. See Nd1 108, 328 (expln. of ñāṇa); Nd2 s. v. and N0. 466; Ps i.35; ii.156, 189; Vbh 228, 334; Pug 14; Nett 19, 20; Miln 342; Vism 373; Mhvs xix.20; DA i.175; DhA ii.49; iv.30; Sdhp 228, 470, 482. See also the discussion in the Cpd. 60 sp., 224 sq. For the phrase sayaṃ abhiññā sacchikatvā and abhiññā -- vosita see abhijānāti. The late phrase yathɔ abhiññaṃ means ʻ as you please, according to liking, as you like ʼ, J v.365 (= yathādhippāyaṃ yathāruciṃ C.). For abhiññā in the use of an adj. (˚abhiñña) see abhiñña

Or circumambulation can be practiced for self-centred purposes.

Malcolm wrote:
Even the Buddha talked about "his robes, his sangha." Conventional markers of identity and possession are not necessarily afflictive.

The point of practicing Dharma is to cause positive path dharmas to arise in the mind, and transforming afflictive positive mental factors into nonafflictive positive mental factors.

I really have no idea why anyone practicing Dharma would practice for any other reason. Certainly there are people who appear to be practicing sublime Dharma who are in fact practicing the eight worldly Dharmas, but what is the point of dwelling on the mistakes of others?

You initially brought up this unqualified example:

Grigoris said:
I can, for example, have a pleasurable feeling while circling a stupa and then get attached to the action and feeling, so that when I am not circling a stupa I feel distress (or I feel a desire/need to experience the positive feeling again and this brings me distress.

Malcolm wrote:
"All afflicted phenomena are suffering."

This refers to both material as well as mental states since all conditioned things are either afflicted or afflictive, apart from path dharmas. Pain is not really a good word for dukkha since pain means "Middle English (in the sense ‘suffering inflicted as punishment for an offense’): from Old French peine, from Latin poena ‘penalty,’ later ‘pain.’"

Suffer means "Middle English: from Anglo-Norman French suffrir, from Latin sufferre, from sub- ‘from below’ + ferre ‘to bear.’" When we look at Tibetan, it is sdug bsngal; sdug means in this context, means misery; ngal ba means exhausted or difficult. Thus we could gloss sdug bsngal as "exhausting misery."

prsvrnc said:
I don't understand how it would be possible to obtain meditative concentration on many objects because those objects aren't solid or stable.  Do they have a particular quality that is single... that one focuses on?

Lobsang Yeshi said:
You start the meditation session by working out your lines of reasoning related to the topic. The goal is to dispel any doubts you might be harboring about the the truth of the teaching. So using your example topic of impermanence, you could start the session by asking yourself, is there anything that might actually be permanent? Or, is there anything that I treat as if it is permanent, without consciously realizing that I'm doing this? Whatever objects come up in response to these or similar questions, analyze them, searching for permanence, and use logic to prove to yourself that in actuality they are not permanent, and that the permanence you suspected might be there is actually illusory. You need to get good at seeking out genuine points of doubt and be honest about the persuasiveness of your internal reasoning, since this won't work if you just go through the motions as a sort of kabuki theater in your head.

If your analytical meditation is successful, at some point you will experience a strong feeling of certainty regarding the truth of the teaching on impermanence. This feeling of certainty is what you want to stabilize and hold as your concentration object for as long as you can. You are right that this is not a very stable object, and probably would not be the best choice to use to develop calm abiding, but the primary purpose of this practice is to increase your understanding of the teachings and conviction that they are truthful and beneficial.

Anonymous X said:
The object of meditation is only a provisional step to calm and gather the focus on mind. Any object of meditation is either let go of or dissolves as cognizance of impermanence increases. Certainty, or any other object in the field of cognition gives way to total presence. Conceptual and non-conceptual are both seen as impermanent. Nothing is held on to. Holding on is a reification of a concept. This is deep habit energy. I'm not even sure that samadhis really touch this.

A lot of unintended consequences can result from making offerings to worldly beings. For example, there can be unintended consequences from making Sang offerings, sometimes fatal ones. But everyone thinks Sang offering are great, and never question the wisdom of making them in this or that place. But when one looks a little deeper, one discovers many stories of people who have mistakenly upset demons in a given area through doing Sang, through doing Chö, through doing Serkyem, etc. When you go and piss off some nāga for making an offering at the wrong time, or with the wrong incense for example, the effects may not hit you, because nagas strike out at random when they are annoyed — this is just one example.

Lhasa said:
This is the second time in the last couple months I've heard a warning about doing Sang. One of the Ligmincha lay teachers did a facebook live Sang ceremony and he said they had changed the text because the wording to the protectors was so strong. And if one could not follow through, if one 'didn't have the goods' to back up what was said, then very bad things could happen. And now here is Malcolm saying the same thing. So I'm not doing that practice anymore.
But at the time I did the Sang practice with the facebook live ceremony. Proper incense, mustard seeds etc., in my living room. What an amazing shift in energy inside the circle of mustard seeds! So there are now mustard seeds around the perimeter of every room, around the foundation outside and along the property lines.

So my question with Sang and Chod is, my intent is to work on my karmic imprints, not duel with blazing demons, although if I must, I must. Is working within my own mind, with no intent to provoke any outer being, going to p*ss off worldly beings anyway? I suppose the ones actively attacking might object.

Most of the more popular treasure cycles benefitted from aristocratic or institutional patronage. For example, one reason LNT is so widespread, apart from its intrinsic merits, is that Jigme Lingpa was the guru of the daughter of the King of Derge, the Dagchens of Sakya, and so on. This kind of sponsership is not always responsible for the popularity of a given cycle however, case in point, Dudjom Tersar.

By definition there is no yidam practice without empowerment. Yi dam is a translation of samādāna. Samādāna means to undertake a promise. One only receives a yi dam, a commitment, from a guru.

One may, out of devotion, choose to engage in a cycle of offerings and praises to any buddha or bodhisattva, including reciting their mantras/dhāranis which are found in sūtra. But this does not make this practice a yi dam or samādāna practice.

The original purpose of Sang, as I understand it, is that one has made some error, one purifies this mistaken through fumigation with aromatic plants. The second ancient idea of Sang related to nomads was that one would make any newcomer who came to your camp through juniper smoke, etc., to decontaminate them. When doing Sang with Tibetans, this custom is still observed. Later Sang became merged with the Buddhist idea of making offerings to the four classes of guests, but this is not part of the original, pre-Buddhist custom. And of course, confessions are a very important part of the Sang rite; absent, for example in Chö.

Some illusions continue much longer and feel more painful than others is all. Contemplating that scale of time and the duration of life in God realms is difficult for us to really comprehend directly.

If you could persuade the others to abandon the killing it would be fantastic.

Grigoris said:
The slaughter is actually illegal (because they kill the bull without rendering it unconscious first), so really it is up to the police to stop it.  Have you ever tried to stop a baying mob of blood lusting zealots?

The church ain't going to stop it because the entire festival/spectacle is highly profitable.

The protector will not want them to stop because it is a source of power for them.

So unless a Guru Rinpoche comes along I don't think the practice will stop any time soon.

Well, that was what the OP asked about, so we can attempt to answer or simply state that the question cannot be answered as one of the terms does not really apply in this context.

I agree that it is fraught with problems, made much worse by the worldwide hijacking of the 'shaman word' and also the 'indigenous' word.
In the case of 'indigenous' people take it to mean tribal or ethnic as opposed to 'belonging to a specific place'. Hence I have 'indigenous shamanism' being conducted down the road in Glastonbury where it is neither indigenous nor shamanic, but a nice little earner with a killbunny sweatlodge weekend course and a real Certificate to prove you are ready to start drumming up you very own psychic storm. Thankfully, some of those running the courses are moving on the 'mindfulness' , which I'm sure will be 'shamanic mindfulness' before the year is out.

In the case of the Mongolian shamans, I am under no illusions.........goats, and later on dogs etc. in initiations.  I do see some signs of change, however, as some of those soon to become elders would like to move to other forms of offering, but whether they have the courage to do so once they have actually become elders remains to be seen.   I'm told lots of Gelugs there worshipped the Gyalpo in the past but no longer do so,  so maybe that will also help make a less fearful society.

Mantrik said:
Malcolm, firstIy, I was specific about the Himalayas and the need to be narrow in order to define shamanism there.  Secondly,  your logic is akin to saying that 'all swans are white therefore all white things are swans'. I asserted that those shamans I have encountered or read about all seem to use trance, and thus it is a defining characteristic. It makes no sense to then conclude that all who use trance are therefore shamans, and I did not assert that at all, because it would be daft to do so.

I further qualified what I said by asking if 'there may be traditions which don't use it in the HImalayas?  If not, my definition is strengthened, as a description of what is authentically shamanic in Tibet and the wider Himalayas.

I would add that traditionally, the job may have had a title like 'Pau', but then some adopted the 'shaman' label to help people understand what they did. The word has since become very widely misused and debased, but it is the best we have for this discussion in the absence of a detailed list and map of all the shamanic forms and their interactions with Vajrayana.   As I wrote way back, nobody knows for sure, but some best guesses are helpful, and ChNN's book I mentioned picks up at the point where history is more certan.

You do seem to like to argue with points you wish people had made rather than the ones they actually made.

The Jataka Tale about Prince Vessantara has always made me feel uneasy.

Dana is perfected, but at tremendous cost to the Prince's kingdom, and then ultimately, his family.

According to Tibetan tradition, the Jataka where he throws himself off a cliff to feed the mother tigress and her cubs is his last life as a human being before taking birth in Tushita, and then as Śākyamuni.

That's an interesting contrast. Offering of one's own body does not raise the same concerns as giving away the livelihood of your kingdom and your family.

Malcolm wrote:
Sakya Pandita remarks:
Third, the three in the generosity of one who has obtained patience towards the nonarising of all dharmas: renunciation, increased renunciation and great renunciation.

The first is giving up a kingdom. The second is giving up one’s cherished relatives, children, wives, and so on. The third is giving up one’s body, head and limbs and so on.
From this point of view, bodhisattva giving his body to the tigress is great renunciation, the Jataka of Viśvaṃtara giving away his family is increased.

Queequeg said:
AFAIK, the offering to the Tigress is included in all jataka collections, but not as the last incarnation. I assume the Vessantara story is included in the Tibetan canon? Do you know where is appears?

Malcolm wrote:
Jataka of Viśvaṃtara occurs in the Jatakas in the collection of Jatakas.

The tradition that the bodhisattva offered his body to the tigress and then was born in Tuṣita comes from the Sūtra of the Wise and Foolish (translated into Tibetan from Chinese):

"After I gave my body to the starving tigress, I was born in the place of the Tuṣita devas."

Thus, in Tibetan Buddhism, this is the general tradition.

However statement like the above where CNNr says that "there is no separation" and "they are one and the same thing" implies very clearly that the student's mind merges with the teacher's mind.

Malcolm wrote:
No, it implies that the state of the teacher and student are the same state as in all water is wet, all fires are hot. There is no separation in "all water is wet, all fires are hot," where "all" refers to all instances of wetness or heat. When one takes things as a group, a group is by nature not individuated.

Dzogchen does not abandon the firmly established nominalism which permeates general Buddhist discourse, and Buddhist logic in particular—  in fact it reinforces it.

Otherwise florin, you wind up in Advaita land.

fckw said:
Just for me to make sure I understand this particular point, Malcolm: So you are saying that in Dzogchen, "non-dual" refers to the "wetness of drops of water". Because all drops of water are wet, they are said to be "non-dual". In contrast, Dzogchen does not state that "all drops are one water", i.e. it does not interpret non-duality according to the idea that there drops lose individuality any point in time and merge into one unified water entity.
Is this correct, is this what you mean?

Malcolm wrote:
Correct.

fckw said:
This position does make sense to me, yet one thing that I find puzzling about it is that it does not clearly elaborate on the occurrence of individuality. Are there multiple individual bases (gzhi) or not? Or is it rather hold that individuality (and the absence thereof) arises in the base like everything else? If so, then how could the base be said to be either one or many or none?

Malcolm wrote:
The basis is ka dag, i.e., emptiness. It does not make sense to say that emptiness is one thing or many things. However, the emptiness of all things is the same; and yet it makes no sense to speak of emptinesses that are not the emptinesses of specific things. This is why we call the basis, "the generic basis." This basis, though nondual since existence, nonexistence, and so on do not apply to it, is also neither one thing nor many things. If it was one thing, it cannot manifest as a diversity; if it is many things, its single nature is contradicted. The Cuckoo of Vidyā states:
The primal nature of diversity is also nondual; 
in reality, free from the proliferation of partiality.

Then we have the equally thorny definition of 'trance'. Some shamans 'journey' with no recollection of it, others have good recall. There are many variants.

There is little documentation of shamanism per se, let alone pre-Buddhist Tibet, so how are you sure about 'most' ?

Not sure I understand the second sentence......do you mean the present day?  Some have long lineages, so perform according to the teaching of their elders, others are just in it to fleece dopey westerners.

The Laghusamvara indeed is a later tantra, appearing long after the Guhyasamaja and so on were translated during the first promulgation of tantras to Tibet. What makes it more valid than a whole host of earlier tantras in the Nyingma corpus, for example, the Guhyagarbha? This text definitely was translated from Sanskrit into Tibetan during the early ninth century. Did it ever occur to you that the circles in which tantras like Guhyagarbha. Vajrakilaya and so on were necessarily smaller since Vajrayāna was still an extremely new movement in India? Indians were just like Tibetans, going after newer revelations, and neglecting older ones. In fact, Indian panditas who came to Tibet in the 11th were unable to read the palm leave manuscripts from the late 8th/earlhy 9th century at Samye because in that 200 year period, scripts had changed so much. Dzogchen was a teaching which existed at Nalanda during the eighth century. We know this because there are several Indian commentaries on that tantra, we have mentions of a commentary for the rdo rje sems dpa' nam kha' che by Śrī Singha quoted bu Nubchen. Why do we accept the Chan masters he quotes as being real people and real texts, but throw shade on the Dzogchen texts and masters he mentions? It is shitty scholarship to do so.

To define any term, you must use it in a context that relates it to one's own experience. The above quote, which you may or may not agree with, is such an attempt at context with regard to rigpa. There is no isolation of rigpa that is going to have any real meaning, only an interpretation.

Of course, you are wholly ignoring the fact that the whole passage is predicated on defining knowledge (rig pa) with respect to its opposite, ignorance (ma rig pa).


For example, Mipham warns about fabricated knowledge that arises from analysis:

Making effort for a long time in growing the huge poisonous tree of the appearance of clinging to union that is fertilized with the empty clarity of a fabricated vidyā that analyzes each extreme is a ground of deviation in the luminous Great Perfection.

Please forgive me confusion, I'm fairly new to this and am trying to unpack the following line by ChNN concerning direct transmission:

"because the state of the reacher and the student are nondual, it is possible for them to be in that state at the same time. There is no separation; they are one and the same thing."

I realise my understanding of non-duality is fairly minimal. Duality I get, quoting ChNN from The Crystal: "a spurious `subjective self' or `ego' that experiences the world as separate from itself, external and objective, and which continually tries to manipulate that world in order to obtain satisfaction and security." That seems fairly straight forward.

When it comes to non-duality I think I'm confused on several levels, including between the relative and the absolute.

So the purpose of the Dzogchen teaching is to experience our real condition as it is - rigpa, our primordial state. Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't our awareness of rigpa individual. My continuum of consciousness, the all-ground consciousness (ālayavijñāna), that is stuck in the cycle of samsara, is individual to everyone else's is it not? My karma is mine alone. When someone else experiences enlightenment that is individual to them, I am not also enlightened.

What is is that is nondual, and allows for direct transmission, what is "one and the same" between teacher and student?

There are three transmissions in Dzogchen, mind, symbol, and verbal. The teacher explains things verbally using symbols, and if the student can be in that state with the teacher at the same time, this is the mind transmission.

Direct introduction is different. With direct introduction the teacher uses experiences to show the student the nature of their mind. There are introductions through ka dag and lhun drub. They are different, but bear on the same point.

I'm not arguing that the two have different approaches. And, I'm not trying to say one is better than the other. But, Chan is not a sutra practice as evidenced by Bodhidharma saying: 'A special transmission outside the scriptures'.

Malcolm wrote:
This is statement dates from a text from 952 c.e. While certainly it must have been a slogan circulating in Chan circles prior to this time, attributed to Bodhidharna, to paraphrase the way it shows up in Tibetan Chan texts "When one has ascertained the view, from then on do not rely on scriptures."

It is well known that Bodhidharma introduced his teachings in the context of the Lankāvatara Sūtra, which is a sūtra that contains the sudden method used in Chan.


Anonymous X said:
Furthermore, Chan also has its 'pointing out' emphasized in Zongmi's 10 Levels Of The Awakening Sequence, No. 1 being: The good friend shows the sentient being the true mind of original awakening. This is the first step as it is in Dzogchen.

Malcolm wrote:
There is certainly a similarity, but again, in the Broughton book, this is not a direct introduction, this is more like someone hearing about the Perfection of Wisdom teachings and activating traces of having practiced Mahāyāna in a past life. It is also true that one will never even hear the word "Dzogchen" in this life without some past life connection with the teaching. Apart from these topographical similarities, however, I see no reason to assume that step 1 of Zongmi is identical in content to what we call direct introduction in Dzogchen without futher concrete evidence in how Chan/Zen is transmitted in the present day.

In brief, Both Chan and Dzogchen maintain they are "outside the scriptures." But this too is merely a topographical similarity. In the case of the former, it is outside sūtras, but depends on sūtras for its context. In the case of the latter, it is outside tantras, but depends on tantras for its context. So when we say that Chan is a sūtra teaching, it means that it is part of the Perfection Vehicle and all of its rhetoric turns on themes found in Mahāyāna sūtras. When we say that Dzogchen is a secret mantra teaching, it means it is part of secret mantra and all of its rhetoric turns on themes found in outer and inner tantras, with less attention paid to the three vehicles of characteristics.

There exists only one sustained discussion of the similarities and differences between Chan and Dzogchen in one text written by the Tibetan master, Nubchen Sanggye Yeshe, which is also one of our earliest sources for Dzogchen prior to the 10th century in Tibet. There is an interesting little book published recently by Van Schaik called Tibetan Zen: Discovering a Lost Tradition which will certainly add the conversation. However, the main point I am making is that Tibetans familiar with Chan grouped it in with the sūtrayāna while at the same time respecting that Chan termed itself a sudden path and a teaching nominally outside of the sūtras since it depended on experience rather than intellectual analysis. Dzogchen is also a path which depends on experience rather than intellectual analysis (but in fact the same may be said of all classes of tantra), but the contexts of the two teachings are really different because of the milieus in which each arose.

Whether a translation of Nubchen's text will prove interesting to Chan/Zen people is doubtful, because apparently the Chan in that text represents the long dead Northern School, and not a living tradition of Chan.

Well, simply put, the buddhahood realized in Vajrayāna is deeper than the buddhahood realized in Mahāyāna because the means are different.

Mahāyāna only leads to the eleventh bhumi. Vajrayāna in general leads to the 13th bhumi, Vajradhara. What is the difference? According to the Saṃputa Tantra, buddhas of the eleventh and twelfth bhumis do not recognize all phenomena as being the display of their own pristine consciousness. This realization is confined to buddhas of the thirteenth bhumi. Of course, whether someone accepts this or not depends very much on whether one accepts the Saṃputa Tantra, a general commentary tantra on the mother tantras, as being valid. Why is there this difference? Because the paths or means are different.

Very clearly, he describes seeing the nature of the mind as rigpa. And I agree with this completely. Again, on 68, "When the clapper strikes the bell, it is like a moment of seeing the nature of the mind. That is rigpa."

When I read this book, I understand him to say that seeing the nature of the mind is rigpa. Therefore, I do not see a real difference between the essentials of what he is saying and what I am saying.

I don't mind that the topic has strayed into practice.

Garchen Rinpoche just gave a two day empowerment of Vajrakilaya along with empowerment to use
a phurba and some instructions and demonstration, rather brief.
I've attended every Vajrakilaya empowerment/drubchen he has given online in the last five years.
This is the first time he has given instructions on using a phurba online. But it was very brief.

You all are being very helpful because it is almost impossible to ask him questions via email anymore.
Thank you.

I would go with a phurba made from mixture of sky metal and a weapon that has killed someone. A light saber phurba would be cool too.

Ok, here is the real deal. According to the Vajrakīlaya Anudhamapratipana-tantra
Iron or black wood
is the material for a wrathful action phurba.
So now you have your answer. An iron kīla is what you need.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, I addressed this point earlier. It is well known that in Gampopa's mahāmudra the paths and stages are regarded as little more than distractions, and not important. That still does not make the four yogas any less sequential. The error is asserting that the mapping of them to the paths and stages was definitive or even necessary. This is what freaked out the Sakyas —— "irresponsible" Kagyu yogis telling them they didn't need no stinkin paths or stages.

According to Gyalwa Yangonpa, the four yogas are for those who, in his words, cannot be in this state:
It is not soiled by experience and sensations, it is not corrupted by realization and certainty, it is not divided by view, meditation and conduct, it is not sectioned into a basis, path and result, all of these phenomena of appearance and existence, samsara and nirvana are neither removed nor added, bound nor freed, nor fixed with an antidote. Recognition of and self-liberation into one’s own state is called “mahāmudra.”
It is for people who do not experience buddhahood through intimate instructions; with respect to that, the four yogas are like thögal in Dzogchen.

I know very little, but I think I understand what Malcolm is saying about readiness, and of course buying a scalpal does not make a person a surgeon.
However,  the topic was about the realtive qualities of materials, so it has strayed, as discussions do, into the performance of practice itself.

The person who decides if a practitioner is ready to perform lower activities is their Guru.

Nobody else can decide upon that.

For example, there is the so-called “Dzogpa Chenpo” of one group which who say, “If you realize it in the morning, you are a buddha in the morning and if you realize it in the evening you are a buddha in the evening”. And there is the the so-called “Characteris- tics” of one group who say, “If dissection is done using free.

from one and many, I will by this be buddha”. And there is the so-called called “Paramita” of one group who say, “Rely- ing on method and prajñå, I will by this be buddha”. And there is the so-called “Mantra” of one group who say, “Rely- ing on the channels, winds, and drops and development and completion, I will by this be a buddha”. And there is the so- called “Kadampa” of one group who say, “There are the oral instructions for relying on the three beings great, middling 194 I will by this be buddha.” The whole lot of them are mis- taken; I dare them to give me a reply, what are you doing?!” He said, “The whole lot of them are mistaken; they are not doing anything except for changing from the ten non-virtues to the ten virtues!” He said, “Those with greater intelligence will change from outflowed virtue to unoutflowed virtue! He said, “There is a group who say, “The ten non-virtues will not contaminate me!”; they have befriended evil deeds!”.

He said, “The Buddha taught eighty four thousand dharma doors. If the whole lot are summed up, they condense down to body, speech, and mind. And moreover, body and speech even are retinue. The principal one is mind.” He said, “Not even one moment of non-virtue should be done. And do not lose yourself either to one moment of indeterminacy from the perspective of the antidote”. He said, “I heard rinpoche say, “It is necessary to travel the three types of path: inference has to be made into path; blessings have to be made into the path; and direct perception has to be made into the path. He said, “Characteristic or Påramitå is the one that makes inference into the path. Great Vehicle Secret Mantra makes, through reliance on the pair development and completion, blessings into the path. The one that makes direct perception into the path is co-emergence, luminosity.”

“For the four yogas, the yoga of one pointedness is that moment of awareness where there is no stoppage of the clarity. The yoga of freedom from elaboration is that rigpa’s entity is seen as birthless. There is no hope upwards to buddhahood, no concern downwards to saîsåra, and in between with no grasping to appearances, no being deceived by other. The yoga of one taste is that you realize the insepa- rability of appearance and emptiness. The yoga of non- meditation is that, whichever comes forth, whichever is produced, it shines forth in one entity thus, everything at the time of the thought process comes as meditation.”

Yes, for some people it is hard to see the difference between Chan and Dzogchen. But their approaches are quite different, and for this one has to look to those Tibetan masters who practiced both.

The difference in approach is based on whether you are a Sūtra practitioner or a Secret Mantra practitioner. In some respect, whether you practice sūtra or tantra is a little irrelevant if you are studying with real Dzogchen master. But because Dzogchen is grounded in Secret Mantra, one cannot practice it without a guru, nor without the inconvenient litte thing called "direct introduction," which is absent both in Sūtra in general, and Zen/Chan.

Over the years I must have read these passages more than a hundred times, I think. Still not sure if I am getting them right. The gist of Rinpoche's explanation of why rigpa =/= nature of the mind seems to me to be something like that:

(1) sems-nyid is a term found in all HYT, rigpa is a strictly Dzogchen thing;

Malcolm wrote:
No, because it is found also in Mahāmudra teachings, especially translations of Mahāmudra texts by Vairocanarakṣita, an Indian master  lived in Tibet in the 11th century and translated these texts into Tibetan independently.

treehuggingoctopus said:
The last passage of Rinpoche's, however, seems to identify rigpa as both the Base ("Rigpa means that underlying condition of essence, nature, and energy of which the individual has had no experience up to now, with which he's not had contact") and the direct, lived knowledge of the Base ("Now the teacher has put him in contact with it, given him that experience, and now he has lived it or perceived it. Now, that experience, however minimal, that which is now perceived, that's what we're calling rigpa")*. Frankly, there are many early texts of Rinpoche's in which the Base and rigpa are depicted like that. If the translated into English and published texts and teaching transcripts of ChNN are in any way representative here, Rinpoche starts to consistently define rigpa as our knowledge (in the sense of "being in") of our primordial state towards the end of the 1990s. Or so has my amateur textual study led me to believe.

Are these specifically from Gampopa or a rephrase of something more universal? I am familiar with a slightly different translation of this from Sakya stuff. Meaning, are they attributed solely to him, or are they stuff he ..sort of synthesized? Or, have they simply been adopted by basically everyone?

The point, it seems to me, is that people think that rigpa refers to the nature of mind rather than the knowledge of the nature of mind. They take is as like a synonym for Buddha Nature rather than just the recognition of that.


Malcolm wrote:
Yes, and they are mistaken to do so. ChNN states over and over again that rig pa is not the nature of the mind.

Stewart said:
Fair enough.

To be clear, I was simply commenting that a short video really doesn't do justice to Mingyur Rinpoche's style and ability to transmit inimate instructions.

I never met Tulku Urgyen, but I've been told by one of his students that Mingyur Rinpoche emulates TUR perfectly.

Interestingly, as you know, TUR never spoke English, yet succeeded in transmitting Dzogchen to hundreds of students. I'm unsure his translator used/uses 'knowledge' as a translation of rig pa, but through the thorough explanations and introductions by TUR, many people had a concrete experience of their natural state.


Malcolm wrote:
How many people have cruised through here, including people who have gone to this and that Dzogchen master (ChNN, TUR, YMR, Tsoknyi, etc.), convinced that the "awareness" neo-advaitans talk about is the same thing as rig pa?

What is important is that someone learns what rig pa is. This is why I do not translate the word, why EPK does not translate it anymore, why Adriano Clemente does not translate it, and so on. But if we are going to explain what the word means in English, it clearly means "knowledge" and "knowing", and not awareness.

I think there is a problem of terminology here. If someone is using awareness, non-dual awareness, selfless awareness or whatever to denote rigpa, as "none of the five skandhas are rig pa", then awareness, as they mean it, is not conditioned and relative.

None of the five skandhas are rig pa because rig pa is knowledge. You will never find a single text that includes knowledge, or ignorance for that matter, as one of the five aggregates.

Take Sam Harris, for example. He could have directly perceived the nature of mind when it was pointed out to him by Tulku Urgyen. He could refer to this non-dual unconditioned knowledge as "awareness". His use of this word does not mean his experience was conditioned and relative.

Malcolm wrote:
All experience is conditioned and relative. There is no such as an experience which is not conditioned and relative.

One could argue the same of Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche. Just because he teaches about awareness a lot, doesn't mean he has no realisation and his understanding is just conditioned and relative.

Malcolm wrote:
Awareness (saṃprajāna) is a mental factor (caitta) which is always associated with mindfulness (smṛti). Mental factors arise simultaneously with a mind. There is no other "awareness" spoken of in Buddhadharma.

The mind (citta), consciousness (vijñāna), or intellect (manas) is a conditioned (saṃskrita) entity by nature, and so too are mental factors.

I was wondering a few things since last night. Firstly, is it the case that when Harris (or Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche) say "awareness" are they always implying Rigpa? Take the video I linked earlier with Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche. If we substitute his use of awareness for the word Rigpa we get things like this:
"Rigpa is with us all the time; whether you have thought or not, whether you have emotion or not, whether your mind is distracted or not, whether you become unconscious or not, rigpa is always there. But the main point is that we have to realise our rigpa, recognise our rigpa."

This shows the limit to using awareness as a translation for rigpa as we are using awareness for three different things: ordinary deluded awareness, nature of mind and understanding of nature of mind.

Yes, because when one is unconsciousness one is necessarily unaware. If one is aware, one is necessarily conscious.

Rang gi means "one's own"; in Tibetan; it is the genitive case, showing possession. Thus, rang gi rig means "one's rig pa." I'll spare you the citation avalanche.

None of the five skandhas are rig pa. However, in one usage, rig pa refers to the mind's capacity to know.

Huh? Talk about moving the goal posts. Of course translating a list of five areas of knowledge or study, knowledge is a better way to refer to them than awareness, but this is a just jargon, and jargon unrelated to dzogchen's rigpa, unless you think science is preferable to knowledge? Anyway, seriously enough of this. I concede the point - knowledge is better than awareness but only because then marigpa can be ignorance.

Malcolm wrote:
You are incorrect, look at the citation I provided for you from a commentary attributed to Vimalamitra on one of the seventeen tantras:

Again:
Furthermore, based on the power of repelling the armies of samsara, vidyā (rig pa) is 1) the knowledge (vidyā) of names designated by words, 2) helpful, worldly knowledge such as healing, arts and crafts, and so on, 3) the five sciences (rig pa gnas lnga) of the treatises and so on, 4) knowing (vidyā) as a factor of consciousness, 5) sharp and dull worldly knowledge and so on, and 6) the knowledge of the essence (snying po) that permeates all that is free from ignorance, unobscured by the obscurations of ignorance and so on.
All of these things are included under the term vidyā in Dzogchen teachings.

I know and I'm aware I'm pushing the point a bit  (it would work if you have two different words for mistaken cognition and unmistaken cognition) but it's not such a massive error.

Malcolm wrote:
Your reframing of my statement fails because awareness is always present when there is consciousness, but knowledge is not always present when there is consciousness and awareness. It really is that simple.

Further, there is no such thing as the five awarenesses. There is such a thing as the five sciences (pañcavidyāsthana).

Another problem with your defense of "awareness" as a proper translation of vidyā/rig pa is that it does not correspond even with respect to common language. Absolutely no one says "I am aware of how to drive" when they mean "I know how to drive." They do not say, "I am aware of how to tie my shows" when they mean "I know how to tie my shoes."

Even when we examine the root of "to know," according to the OED, we find the word descends from Old English cnāwan (earlier gecnāwan) ‘recognize, identify,’ of Germanic origin.

Aware, on the other hand comes from "Old English waru ‘commodities,’ of Germanic origin, having the primary sense ‘object of care.’ Hence awareness is far more apt for shes bzhin, the mate of mindfulness, dran pa.

It is not so clear cut in English. Knowledge can mean being aware that something exists, so you are correct in that, as it is one of the definitions.  However, it can also be defined as understanding, which is different.
I believe that here it is the case that awareness of something is not the same as understanding it, knowing about it, hence the vocab difference.

michaelb said:
Sure, but then understanding would be a better word. Awareness can also connote understanding, knowledge, recognition, cognition, etc. You can be aware of details, differences, characteristics, good points, bad points, whatever.  I agree that knowledge is better, largely because it is the opposite of ignorance but anyway, it's not really a big deal, which is why, on balance, Sam Harris using awareness (he uses loads of other words, too) isn't proof that his presentation of dzogchen is flawed. I'm not saying that proof doesn't exist but mistranslating one word isn't it.

Indeed it does.

Yongay Mingyur Rinpoche, in the course of pointing out instructions, would often comment as to how we all likely have experienced such moments of "clarity," at times in our life.  But until one recognizes the significance of such moments, due to the skill of a qualified teacher, one attaches no particular importance to such moments of "clarity."  I suppose one could say there is no "Vidya" until one actually has the "knowledge" of the significance of such moments.  But once it's known, one must stabilize...and therein lies the rub, right?   Conditioning is so strong, Samsara and habit are so strong--that one conceptualizes and reifies such moments, and deludes oneself that one has "achieved something" or has produced a result.  Or worse.  That's my sense, at least.

I'm having a look through the third volume of CTR's "Profound Treasury" and there's actually quite a lot about rigpa in there. This passage caught my eye: Sem is generally regarded as ordinary, as samsaric. But there is an interesting term for sem, “transcendent sem,” which is said to have been coined by the great nineteenth-century Nyingma master, Mipham Rinpoche. In Tibetan, transcendent sem is called nyuk sem, or “primordial sem,” which is the same as rikpa.

Malcolm wrote:
CTR is referring to series of three polemical texts by Mipham, one of which Hopkins translated as "fundamental mind." Mipham's rendering of gnyug sems in Sanskrit is ādyacitta, which actually means "first," etc. In this text Mipham quotes from the Great Tantra Clarifying The Meaning of Freedom From Proliferation:
In the context of explaining the illustrative examples of that basis, it is said to be  empty and pervasive like space; immaculate like a crystal; unchanging like a vajra; the source of all blessings like a jewel; unimpeded illumination like the heart of the sun and so on. [7/a] It is the opposite of ignorance (avidyā) and inertness, existing as nature of a veridical consciousness, it is knowledge (vidyā). Since it is beyond cause and condition, it is self-originated. Since it does not arise adventitiously, it is the pristine consciousness that has become the nature of the vidyā that has always existed. It is the basis from which all samsara and nirvana appear.

I think even though Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche could have been more accurate, it does not mean his teaching is totally mistaken. And I would say the same is true of Harris, to a degree.

Malcolm wrote:
I never said that YMD was "totally mistaken." In Tibetan, I am quite sure his teachings are absolutely perfect.

Look, I am a translator. Being neurotic about words is my stock in trade. But if you say to me, "Tibetan teacher says X in contradistinction to what you claim," I am never going to say, "Oh gee, I guess I was wrong." I never make statements about these things without very sound research. Sometimes I do more research and change my mind, but not about this one.

For those who want to believe I am just an intellectual, this is fine by me. I could care less.

The fact is that word awareness as a translation of rig pa is plain wrong: no ifs, ands, or buts about it. People continue to use it because of Herbert Guenther's translations. But he was wrong, and that is that.

Thanks dor the clarification. Its been a while since ive read alan,s stuff.

Knowledge is the word uae by chnn? Whats the difference between his use of contemplation and knowledge.

Srry for all the questions

Rig pa is used in two ways by CHNN: the first is "instant presence;" the second is "knowledge of one's primordial state."

Contemplation is how he translates ting ge 'dzin, samadhi.

Yes, that was the challenge you put forth, I merely pointed out that I think Harris has a chauvanistic attitude towards Islam that is not grounded in any real appreciation for the subject of his bia, he says for example:
Muslims everywhere who love freedom must honestly grapple with the challenges that a politicized strand of their religion poses to free societies.
He has make many such statements, and yet nowhere does he show this danger to free societies exists. In fact, ISIS, etc, is only a danger to those societies that have been fractured and damaged as a result of US adventurism into the Middle East and Central Asia. ISIS poses no threat to" Western Civilization(tm)."

Yes, it is certainly true that two centuries of racist policies in Europe have created tension between former colonial powers and workers they imported from North Africa, Pakistan, and so on. But in reality, Europe has been dealing with terrorists of one stripe or another for decades. As far as I am concerned, the rise of neo-fascism is a much more of an existential threat than a bunch of violent sociopaths in Syria and Iraq who have proven they are so despicable the world agrees they should be utterly and completely rubbed out.

Their Post-Trungpa decision to translate rig pa as awareness is a mistake. Not a big fan of insight, but it is better than awareness, since prajñā and vidyā are synoyms in Dzogchen texts. Valby uses 'intelligence," but not a big fan of that gloss either.

How can anything be explained accurately if the words and meanings do not correspond? Dzogchen tantras of all classes spend an inordinate amount of time on language, meaning, and words.

I fail to see how Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche's teaching would be improved by changing awareness to knowledge. Indeed, such a change may lead to further confusion. Knowledge of what, like book knownedge, etc.

Malcolm wrote:
MIgyur Rinpoche is not a native speaker. He relies on translators he trusts. However, this is not a criteria for accuracy. When the word rig pa is examined in its context in Dzogchen texts, there is really no way that anyone can justify the gloss "awareness" in a real sense. As a noun, it means "knowledge"; as a verb, it means "to know."

For example, the commentary on the Tantra Without Syllables clarifies this point precisely:
Furthermore, based on the power of repelling the armies of samsara, vidyā (rig pa) is 1) the knowledge (vidyā) of names designated by words, 2) helpful, worldly knowledge such as healing, arts and crafts, and so on, 3) the five sciences (rig pa gnas lnga) of the treatises and so on, 4) knowing (vidyā) as a factor of consciousness, 5) sharp and dull worldly knowledge and so on, and 6) the knowledge of the essence (snying po) that permeates all that is free from ignorance, unobscured by the obscurations of ignorance and so on.

Not better, just far more informed about the subject matter at hand, the teaching of the Great Perfection.

For example, I don't know anything about Chan/Zen, apart from the polemics about it found in early Dzogchen commentaries which date from the late 9th century. So I rarely venture into the Zen forums because I am not really qualified to talk about Chan. All I am qualified to do with respect to Chan and Zen is to ask questions, when they occur to me to ask them, as well as relate what early Tibetan Dzogchen masters thought about the Chan tradition as it existed in Tibet in the late 8th century. I expect that people who have no background in Dzogchen teachings to exercise the same respect when they visit these boards.

You can read my introduction in Buddhahood in this Life, Wisdom, 2016, where I discuss the term rig pa and other important terms in the system of Dzogchen. There are some translators who persist in using the gloss "awareness" for rig pa; but there has been a strong movement among Dzogchen translators for leaving the term rig pa either untranslated, or as in my case, back-translating it into Sanskrit, vidyā.

Vasana said:
Best not to assume anything. If you understood the context of these teachings and how the base, path & fruit of Dzogchen & Mahamudra is presented, you probably wouldn't feel the need to ask those questions in the first place. Dzogchen begins with direct introduction, then you come to confidence about what was introduced through applying various means, then the rest of the path is simply continuing in that state, where thoughts are self-arisen and self-liberated.

Anonymous X said:
I am asking a straight forward question. What has this practice done for you? Has discursive thinking stopped? Has the subject/object dichotomy been resolved? Has there been any transformative experience or understanding that is now irreversible and functional? This being in contrast with philosophical or dialectical constructs. Is there a mind or no-mind, or neither a mind or a no-mind? Maybe something else? Some other description that is bulletproof in your own being? I'm not being glib.

As far I as can tell, Direct Introduction renders the tibetan ngo sprod (pronounced "ngotrö"), where one is introduced to Rigpa in its "nakedness".

Malcolm wrote:
"Direct introduction" is ChNN's translation of rang ngo thag tu sprad, which could otherwise be translated as "directly encountering one's own state." This is the first phrase of the famous three phrases of Garab Dorje.


Marc said:
Whereas the rig pa'i rtsal dbang (pronounced "rigpé tsel wang"), is the Empowerment (wang) of Rigpa's Expressive Power / Dynamic Display (Tsal).

Before reading Malcolm comments, I would have said that the rig pa'i rtsal dbang is the gateway to the practice of Thögal, while rigpa'i ngo sprod is the gateway to Dzogchen in general, and Trekchö more specifically.
But apparently, this is an oversimplication / generalization...

Malcolm wrote:
The term rig pa'i rtsal dbang, (empowerment of the potential of vidyā) is used in many contexts — for example, there are the eighteen rig pa'i rtsal dbangs of the so called mind series; the fourth empowerment of the King's Tradition of Avalokiteśvara from the Mani Kabum is called the empowerment of the potential of vidyā, where it is also noted that it forms the root of all other empowerments.

ChNN has stated many times that "direct introduction" is an empowerment of the potential of vidyā. Thus, I use them interchangeably.

makewhisper said:
Would you say that śamatha is vital to recognition during the direct introduction?

Malcolm wrote:
Normally, during the course of a direct introduction, the master will ask people to remain in a calm, undistracted state. I am under the impression from one of Tulku Urgyen's students that he was impressed with the śamatha of the some Vipassana people who became his students and thought it was a great preparation for Dzogchen practice. The serious practice of the mind series teachings in Santi Mahā Sangha requires the development of śamatha. And in the 21 semzins of the intimate instruction series, there are methods for developing śamatha very quickly.

Malcolm wrote:
Dear Friends:

It is my pleasure to announce that Wisdom Publications and Zangthal Editions will collaborate in bringing out the Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra ( rig pa rang shar ) and the Self-Liberated Vidyā Tantr a ( rig pa rang grol ) as the Seventeen Tantras: Volume 1 & 2. The first edition of this two volume set will be hardbound, in a clothbound slip case. Publication of these two translations are presently scheduled for late summer/early fall, 2018. Together with an introductory essay with text critical overview of the history and origins of the Seventeen Tantras as related in the Vima Nyinthig, index, glossary, etc., to be included in vol. 2, I expect the page count to be somewhere around 900 pages all totaled.

One thing people should understand is that with respect to the Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra, according to Chetsun Sengge Wangchuk, possession of the text itself is permission to read it. So while I encourage readers who are interested to have Dzogchen transmission, there is no absolute need to have the lung for this text, though of course it is also good in you can obtain the lung.

I will keep you posted with updates here.

They both depend on a kind of introduction. However, the four samadhis are based on the experience of the rig pa'i rtsal dbang, while the four yogas are introduced in a gradual process of pointing out.

That said, it is vital to both approaches to discover the experience of śamatha in the beginning. Without that experience, there are no four contemplations nor four yogas.
