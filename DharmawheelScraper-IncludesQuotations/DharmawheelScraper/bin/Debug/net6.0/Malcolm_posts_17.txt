WWBD.

I think the Buddha's conversation with Brahma after his enlightenment guides Buddhists on whether the Dharma should be shared openly or not: the Dharma should be shared openly. I think that is further modified by the account of Anathapindika's death bed conversation with Sariputra where Sariputra taught him the actual teachings for the first time (not just encouragement to cultivate the Brahma Viharas, generosity, etc.), prompting Anathapindika to ask that these teachings not be withheld from lay people.

The question is how far one can go in sharing - only passively? Or can one reach out to another to suggest a better way to live? There are mentions in the sutras of the benefit that accrues to a person who inspires another to go and listen to teachings, "Come, friend, let's go listen to this teacher."

Clearly, trying to get people to take refuge to notch the numbers is stupid and pointless.

One, this assertion makes the Buddha a liar. In the Tibetan translation of the Nirvana sūtra translated from Sanskrit, in three separate places the Buddha states:

"Tathāgtagarbha exists in all sentient beings."

In the Tibetan translation of the Nirvana sūtra from Chinese, it says 10 times:

"Buddhanature exists in all sentient beings."

There is no statement in any sūtra that claims, "Tathāgtagarbha exists in all sentient beings, except for those born after such and such a date."

Pondera said:
Okay. So instead of masturbation you have indicated sexual intercourse.

Without preventative measures, any man and woman engaging in sexual intercourse should not be surprised if the woman becomes pregnant. Nor should it be their choice to abort the fetus because it’s an “inconvenience” for them.

If men and women choose to have sexual intercourse with out contraception, they should be prepared for the consequences.

I have nothing against masturbation; just as (in the same way) I have nothing against a woman having a period each month.

I have nothing against contraception. My only suggestion is that if a pregnancy occurs - then one should consider the life form brewing within. And one should consider it’s right to live.

I understand that in practice abortions happen for many reasons. Unwanted pregnancies happen all the time. The development of the fetus (or embryo) in some cases is within such a short time frame that the designation of “life” is debatable. So don’t straw man me here. I have a very reasonable point of view that only slightly verges on “the right to live”. And for that I should be vilified?

So, look. I’m not arguing against your belief that a woman has a right to decide whether she brings an fetus to term or not. That is her right.

I’m saying that, as it was in the case of my own birth, a woman might want to consider that the fetus has a right to life - however inconvenient the circumstances might be.

If my father had his way, my life would have been aborted. My mother chose to have me, lived as a single mother, raised me into the adult I am now. I have had my share of crappy moments in life - but overall I am happy to be alive.  I am happy that I was given the chance to live. My mother is proud of the person I have become.

That being said; I think masturbation is a waste of time and resources. It is a habit of the young. It is a habit of this generation who has access to pornography at the touch of a button. Watching pornography increases your testosterone levels by 35%. That elevation in testosterone drives you to find a sexual outlet as fast as you can. And obviously, we all now how that ends.

Do the sewage system a favour and save your testosterone for a better purpose.

The most important thing is to have Compassion for others in all of these situations. What is a Buddhist without Compassion? If we continue on in such a manner where we always care for individuals who are on either side of this issue, as well as those struggling in hospitals and places where these procedures are done, they will feel Loved. And if they feel Loved, they will likely choose a path that is most suitable for them in the situation as opposed to acting out of fear, coercion, or pressure. If they themselves receive enough Compassion from someone else, they will make Compassionate choices, and what Buddhist would argue against a truly Compassionate choice, if it is truly that?

Malcolm wrote:
Compassion can be tricky.

If you knew your pregnancy was going to result in Hitler, would you abort?

Further, all the pro-lifers here are arguing from the perspective that a zygote/fetus is a person. But this is really not clear at all. The generally accepted biological definition of "personhood" is viability, that is, abortion should be prohibited (other than in special cases) after a fetus reaches viability:

One could question how much thought plays a role in buddha dharma, people debate over translations, in ones true nature whatever that is there is no debate, i guess it passes times to translate things and some are necessary but that is more about traditions going from one culture to another. In India for example language, dress and culture changes every 15-20km yet reality is one and undivided and is only known through living traditions and absorbing it via experience this is true bhavana, it cant be translated, its to vast, reality is to vast to be explained and is only known through silence and shunya.

Samma Dhitti Samadrishti is not about translations, intellectual sectarian or religious view is not drishti, drishti is far more insightful and organic to our true nature. Insight is enough, if one has insight into reality without modification of views and conditions then its enough even if one calls themselves a buddhist or not, its more simple and profound than people want to give credit or perhaps insecurity or domination wants to make it to be more than what it is. One moment of insight is worth more than a dictionary of translated texts which sometimes gives a brief stimulation to the intellect and not a profound change in ones being.

I appreciate your care, Malcolm. And I agree in the many cases the woman becomes unwanted pregnant.

However there are different circumstances.

I have known a friend who liked so much charming men. She could not get enough of them. 5 times this resulted in pregnancy, 5 times an abortion. She spoke about like she was proud to can solve her problems.

A fellow was making a beautiful bed for his coming child, since his wife was pregnant. He was so happy to become father. But behind his back, his wife asked for an abortion.

There was a women desperate, she wanted to take care of the child in her womb but she could even not take care of herself. There was nobody to help her. Easy to give her the rights to decide for herself.

Therefore no general law or opinion can be the one for all, but depending on the circumstances avoiding as much as possible harm.
And if men can help, they should but at least not harm. Same for women. Respecting all, our nature has no gender.

How long have the scholars and intellectuals been trying to explain what is the dharma and the meaning of the sutras, yet there is little evidence of their bodhi and experience, where they can only quote others experience or speak concepts, how many more posts does one need on a forum to keep going round and round in circles circulating the same old worn out opinions and speculation only obscuring the real essence

Buddha cannot be put into concepts, its beyond words, words limit what awakened being/consciousness is, the translations are a mess, one just has to choose which one they think is right or makes the most sense

Like Nemo says science now accepts that they only know 5% within that 5% is a human who thinks his mind has the capacity to understand the whole, this is a fundamental error and should be quite obvious.

Malcolm wrote:
That's the story you like. This is the one I prefer, Maitreya states in chapter 4 of the Mahāyānottaratantra:

Likewise, without leaving the dharmakāya,
 the Muni effortlessly displays emanations
to all fortunate ones
in all the worlds.

Just as Brahma enters the desire realm without leaving his celestial mansion,
and is seen by the devas, and upon his sight, they abandon delight in objects,
the fortunate in all worlds see the tathāgata, who does not move from the dharmakāya,
upon whose sight their taints are permanently removed. 

Brahma effortlessly appears [to the devas],
through the power of his past aspirations
and the virtue of the devas,
the self-originated nirmaṇakāya is just the same.

So, you see, the Buddha does not need to perceive the suffering of sentient beings, because he appears to them based on the cause, his past aspirations, and the condition, their virtue.

Having transmigrated, been conceived, born, arrived at his father's palace, 
enjoyed amusements, [remained in] isolation, [engaged in ascetic] practice, conquered māra,
attained great awakening, demonstrated the path to the city of peace,
and having shown that, the Muni [now] cannot be seen by the unfortunate.

These deeds arise from the Buddha's past aspirations, but without merit, one cannot see him, or even hear his name.

The text continues:

Just as the heat of the rays of the sun simultaneously
cause lotuses to bloom and jasmine to close,
but the sun gives no thought to the faults and qualities
of the opening and closing of the lotus, the sun of the ārya is the same.

Just as the sun, without thought, 
shines its light all at once
and causes the petals of the lotus to blossom
and ripens everything else,
in the same way, without thought,
the sublime dharma light rays of
of the tathāgata sun
enter the disciple lotuses.

So here we see the Buddha has no need to perceive or think about the happiness and suffering of sentient beings, just as the sun pays no regard to the opening and closing of the lotus and jasmine flower. The Buddha Sun shines his light upon all.

because (5) that which cannot be inferred is unsurpassable;
because (6) the unsurpassable cannot be categorized [in either samsara or nirvana];
because that which cannot be categorized does not abide [in either samsara or nirvana;
because there is no thought of qualities [of nirvana] or faults [of samsara];
the dharmakāya is inconceivable
because of being subtle through [the first] five reasons; 
and the rūpakāya is inconceivable
as it is not an entity because of the sixth.

And in chapter 4:

Showing an appearance like the king of the gods in a jewel;
well-formed like the drum of the gods;
like cloud banks, his pervasive love and wisdom
spreads to the peak of existence of limitless migrating beings;
like Brahma, demonstrating myriad emanations
while never leaving his stainless abode; 
like the sun, the light of gnosis always shines;
their minds are like the pure wishfulfilling gem,
the speech of the victors is like an echo, without syllables,
like space, their kāyas are pervasive, immaterial, and permanent;
and like the ground, the stage of buddhahood is the ground
of developing all the medicinal, positive qualities of migrating beings.

Since it is been said more women should talk here..

The long term of the quality of life needs attention. Many opinions and laws have already caused enough suffering.

What law thinks on the suffering of an unwanted child, not getting any compassion, no any  love and so difficult to know to give it then as well? Or a mom alone, even not able to feed herself, or a mom with a sever mental problem, or a genetic disease causing lots of suffering and some other cases. Instead of listening to laws, the welfare of the eventually child is important.

Therefore I find a general law is not okay, because each case is different.

In some cases giving the little for adoption would be an option.

Life is precious, give it value, able to practise, give it the necessary care, the needful affection.

"Love and compassion are necessities, not luxuries. Without them humanity cannot survive."

“When we follow a buddhist teaching it is important to know that Buddha’s teaching is not only the oral teaching he gave in India. Buddha is omniscient, a totally enlightened being having many possibilities to communicate; so the Buddhist teaching has many aspects, not only what was taught in India. In Tibet we have the collection of all the teachings of Buddha called Kangyur. Ka means word of Buddha, gyur means translated in ancient times from Sanskrit to Tibetan. The Kangyur comprises 108 volumes. It does not mean that all these were taught in India at Bodhgaya or somewhere else as oral teachings. In sacred places of India, like Rajghir at Vulture Peak, Buddha taught Mahayana, but most Mahayana teachings are not oral teachings developed in India...

So it's like She was not really born from The tear, but because of the tear ,came to help out Buddha Avalokiteshvara and so appeared this way ?

Volan said:
Here is the story according to His Eminence Kenting Tai Situpa
A teaching given in New Delhi 18.1.2004

For so many eons Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara with that aspiration was liberating sentient beings, and then after many eons through his wisdom and realisation he made an observation, these days we would call it something like a survey. He found that countless sentient beings were suffering. Before also countless sentient beings were suffering and now also. Countless sentient beings are countless, and they will always be countless. Countless cannot become countable sentient beings. Countless by definition is countless always, limitless by definition is limitless; you cannot limit the limitless.

When he saw that, he was so disturbed and upset that he almost broke his vow of saying that I will not reach Buddhahood until the last sentient being attains the Buddhahood. Originally, when he took that vow he said: "If I break my vow may I break into pieces and perish." Because of his original vow he broke into thousands of pieces. At that time he realised that the Buddha is limitless and sentient beings are limitless and sentient beings' essence is also Buddha. That happened because all the Buddhas of the ten directions blessed him and he realised that. Therefore his thousands of pieces transformed into thousand arms and thousand eyes. Normally good things become bad and bad things become worse, but here bad things became good and superb. So the thousand pieces became thousand arms and thousand eyes, and the thousand eyes represent the Buddhas and the thousand arms represent the thousand Universal Monarchs who will be the vehicle of Buddhas' activity. That way Avalokiteshvara developed this quality.

His activity is continuously benefiting sentient beings. Once upon a time he again made an observation. He still saw countless sentient beings suffering. This time it did not make him disappointed and break his vow. Instead he was filled with compassion and out of that compassion two drops of tears dropped from his two main eyes and from those tears one transformed into White Tara and another one transformed into Green Tara. They took a vow from Avalokiteshvara, saying that until your original vow is fulfilled, may we be the mother to all sentient beings suffering in Samsara and liberate them to the Buddhahood. White Tara's manifestation represents helping sentient beings to have longevity, prosperity and all that aspect, and Green Tara represents providing protection for all sentient beings from all fears. White and Green Tara manifest this way.

Largely these are karma driven.

Caoimhghín said:
There are many ways to be "anti-momentaryism," and just because you disagree with Ābhidharmika momentaryisms of various Śrāvaka sects, that does not equate to "There are no moments." As mentioned before by another user, Śrāvaka momentary doctrine is a form of "atomism for time" and is critiqued in largely the same way that atoms are critiqued by Yogācārins and Madhyamakas alike. Just because there are no ultimate atoms of ultimate form, it does not follow that there are not bits of rūpa that sentient beings interact with. Just because the moments are deconstructed, it doesn't mean that there is no such thing as a particular moment of time for a particular locus of experience.

Malcolm wrote:
Also, the Buddha was quite clear that phenomena, including minds, were momentary. The Buddha may not have elaborated in detail upon what a "moment" was, but in the end, the basic unit of time in Buddhism is number of moments it takes to form a thought. In reality, moments are partless. Partless moments that perish as soon as they arise have no observable duration and are immune from Madhyamaka critique.

The notion that the mind is permanent (i.e. not momentary) is just a Hindu idea, Vedantic.

It seems to be positioned higher than an Upasaka.

Do they assist in temple ritual in some way? Can they preach or teach?

Malcolm wrote:
They follow the vows and conduct of a śrāmaṇera, and yes they can teach, etc. The difference between "the laity" (not really an appropriate term for upāsakas) and śrāmaṇeras is the difference of vows. The Buddha's original monastic sangha had no rules. Then eventually, there were 200+, and a common joke in Tibetan circles is that if the Buddha had lived to 100 there would have been more than 500, because most of the rules were implemented because lay people complained about the behavior of this or that monk, etc.

Those who have been born are standing
Like a seed upon a needle.

The vanishing of all these states

They are explained as seals because these four features are held to be like the seal or decree which a minister uses to invoke the authority of the king. This term is found in native Tibetan texts as early as the 12th century, and probably earlier.

The formula, "all compounded phenomena...nirvana is peace" is found in Sthiramati's commentary on the Mahāyānasūtralaṃkara, which was translated in either the 11th century by an obscure translator named Che Tashi (Lce bkra shi) with an Indian.

Könchok Chödrak said:
Thank you, Malcolm. Can you explain in further detail why ordination is a śrāvakayāna rite? And why it entails the śrāvakayāna Vehicle?

Malcolm wrote:
It has to do with the fact that each level of vow has its own rite of bestowal; its own set of vows; its own method of maintaining those vows; and its own method of repairing those vows if they are broken.

Pratimokṣa vows, the vows of personal liberation come from the śrāvaka schools and are detailed in Vinaya. The Tibetans follow the Mulasarvastivadins; Buddhists in Shri Lanka, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos follow the Theravada. East Asian countries such as China, Korea, and Japan, follow the Dharmaguptaka sect.

Then we have the bodhisattva vows. In the Tibean tradition there are two main traditions: Madhyamaka and Yogacāra. They are not different in meaning, but they are different in method of bestowal and the number of vows, etc. one is expected to follow. In China and Japan, the bodhisattva vows are derived from a sūtra that seems to not have an Indian source, the Brahamajala Sūtra. In the Theravada countries there is no rite at all for conferring bodhisattva vows.

Finally, secret mantras vows come from receiving empowerments in the Yoga Tantra and Anuttarayoga tantra.

So there are three kinds of vows, and they each have their own rite, and so on. This is why there is no "Vajrayāna" ordination per se. You should get Buddhist Ethics by Jamgon Kongtrul where the three vows are explained in detail.

In the commentary on the Prajnaparamita Sutra attributed to Nagarjuna, he states the gateway to Buddhahood is faith.

When we start out, categorically, we lack the knowledge of a Buddha and yet we proceed on the assurance that the path leads to Buddhahood. I don't know how anyone gets around the linchpin of faith there.

Canki Sutta lays out what I consider one of the best explanations of how to practice faith.

Analysis and reason is frontal cortex stuff. As I see it, derivative of faith, even when the logician insists there is none.

One important thing to understand that is that śraddha is defined as a mental factor that brings clarity to the mind. It is not like "faith" in the western, Christian sense.

Titus Lucretius Carus ( c. 99 – c. 55 BC) was a Roman poet and philosopher. His only known work is the philosophical poem De rerum natura, a didactic work about the tenets and philosophy of Epicureanism, and which usually is translated into English as On the Nature of Things.
Lucretius Carus seems to be describing how on the other side of the Earth there are beings, who must be living upside down and who experience night when we experience the day:

"The ponderous bodies which be under earth
Do all press upwards and do come to rest
Upon the earth, in some way upside down,
Like to those images of things we see
At present through the waters. They contend,
With like procedure, that all breathing things
Head downward roam about, and yet cannot
Tumble from earth to realms of sky below,
No more than these our bodies wing away
Spontaneously to vaults of sky above;
That, when those creatures look upon the sun,
We view the constellations of the night;
And that with us the seasons of the sky
They thus alternately divide, and thus
Do pass the night coequal to our days,"

https://encyclopediaofbuddhism.org/wiki/The_unanswered_questions


There appear to be various lists of them. Among one such list are the following:

A Realized One exists after death?
A Realized One doesn’t exist after death?
A Realized One both exists and doesn’t exist after death?
A Realized One neither exists nor doesn’t exist after death?

So if we grant this authority, it seems like exactly what goes on in Nirvana/Paranirvana is none of our business.

When all phenomena are done away with,

Okay - thanks for your input. It may, as you said, be a stretch, I don't know, but it seems to me that letting go of all those "fermentations" has to imply stopping struggling with some of the major causes of samsaric suffering. Maybe the Buddha, in the moment of enlightenment, simply realized that he himself had reached the point of "no-struggle" - as part and parcel of liberation. That is, once enlightened, the struggle for attaining it ceases forever. But for the unenlightened, even His own disciples, He said to practice "diligently" unless and until they also reached enlightenment.

A related question, if you don't mind - when the Buddha(s) went into meditative states post-enlightenment, was it for the pure joy of the experience...? Obviously, they would no longer need to be struggling to attain a state which they had already reached.

The term “fermentation” is also translated “canker” or “outflow”. It refers to having an afflicted relationship with phenomena. Through understanding the four noble truths, the Buddha abandoned his afflicted relationship to the three realms.

Many of the terminological equivalents of Buddhist terms in use today were made by people who were not practitioners, who were philologist and linguists, who made their translations with old, nonspecialist dictionaries. Even dictionaries like Edgerton's Buddhist Hybrid Sanskrit dictionary have many errors of understanding, it was after all first published in 1953.

I understand this poses problems for people who do not have at their disposal a primary Buddhist language with which to investigate these issues, but as a practitioner-translator who is fluent in Tibetan and acquainted  with Sanskrit, I can assure you that the greater percentage of the translations of Buddhist texts made prior to 1990, whether out of Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese, Japanese, or Tibetan, made largely by people with no skin in the game other than an academic position, are riddled with errors practitioners would not make, like translating kṣaya as "destruction" rather than "exhaustion." Another example of a bogus translation is rendering dharmakāya as "Law Body" usually seen in East Asian translations prior to a certain period of time. But like New Age ideas, many bad translations of Buddhist terms never die, and get recycled again and again by people who, lacking education and expertise, cannot discern that they are erroneous.

The OP is considering learning new age rhetoric for the benefit of helping non Buddhists. I often repeat the same message in this case compassion for the lowest common denominator. I often remind that it is a Buddhist mantra. Of course I contextualize to my tradition out of veneration.

The difficulty that many here have with mindsets that are not like their own is palpable. I understand and respect this. I am not Mary Poppins contrary to popular belief. However I am very intimate with the mind and inherent bias. I am not judgemental even though I observe it.

If the OP feels it necessary to learn things outside his wheelhouse and personality then it is necessary to consider how to address bias against new age mentality. IMHO the best way to over come stuff like this is Buddhist practice.

I don't have many typical biases. Sure I am still tethered but I upgraded them to being biased against biases.

I'll go a step a step further and maybe upset those who insist Shakyamuni was an ordinary being who awoke and that suffering is really real... It's all a play. Your life with all the suffering and joys and everything else is also a play. If you're not a Buddha then that just means this is the part of the play where Shakyamuni was struggling in a past life.

A bird is genetically coded for flight before it even leaves the egg. It doesn't attempt flight until the causes, conditions and capacities are met.

"This being, that is;
from the arising of this, that arises;
this not being, that is not;
from the cessation of this, that ceases." (Bodhi Sutta: The Bodhi Tree)

That equals: If A then B; if not A then not B.

Buddha first expresses a general form of conditionality or causation. Then follows the special case of applying it to becoming and the cessation of becoming, i.e. the 12 nidanas and their cessation.

In Sutras and the Abhidharma there are also six causes (hetu) and four conditions (pratyaya). They overlap and describe the same phenomenon of how things or beings arise and cease.

Charles Darwin showed how species arise dependent on causes and conditions. They also cease  and become extinct, like mammoths, dinosaurs, sabretooth tigers etc.. have done.

Malcolm wrote:
The point is liberation from afflictions, not describing the inner workings of a nuclear reactor.

There is no explanation outside of Dharma for liberation via dependent origination:


Aemilius said:
Dwelling at Savatthi... Then Ven. Kaccayana Gotta approached the Blessed One and, on arrival, having bowed down, sat to one side. As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "Lord, 'Right view, right view,' it is said. To what extent is there right view?"

"By & large, Kaccayana, this world is supported by (takes as its object) a polarity, that of existence & non-existence. But when one sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment, 'non-existence' with reference to the world does not occur to one. When one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment, 'existence' with reference to the world does not occur to one.

"By & large, Kaccayana, this world is in bondage to attachments, clingings (sustenances), & biases. But one such as this does not get involved with or cling to these attachments, clingings, fixations of awareness, biases, or obsessions; nor is he resolved on 'my self.' He has no uncertainty or doubt that just stress, when arising, is arising; stress, when passing away, is passing away. In this, his knowledge is independent of others. It's to this extent, Kaccayana, that there is right view.

"'Everything exists': That is one extreme. 'Everything doesn't exist': That is a second extreme. Avoiding these two extremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma via the middle: From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications. From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness. From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&-form. From name-&-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media. From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact. From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling. From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving. From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance. From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming. From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. From birth as a requisite condition, then aging & death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair come into play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress & suffering.

"Now from the remainderless fading & cessation of that very ignorance comes the cessation of fabrications. From the cessation of fabrications comes the cessation of consciousness. From the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of name-&-form. From the cessation of name-&-form comes the cessation of the six sense media. From the cessation of the six sense media comes the cessation of contact. From the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling. From the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving. From the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging/sustenance. From the cessation of clinging/sustenance comes the cessation of becoming. From the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth. From the cessation of birth, then aging & death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair all cease.

I think to say when the Gautama Siddhartha, before He left His father’s kingdom, put His hands under a wheel of a cart to help a peasant remove it from a pothole, and when that cart crushed His fingers (I saw this on a TV show about His Life), that was not a “play”, He felt real pain then, and it was a mirror of what Samsara does and the struggles of our pain in it. It is insincere to call the World-Honored One’s troubled a play. For example, in the Lotus Sutra the Bodhisattvas ask the World-Honored One if His troubles have been few, whether the beings in delusion are receptive to His Teachings, and how His Life is going. These are not questions regarding a “play” but a real Buddha Life. The Buddha’s Life is real, and although it is coming from a place higher than the Saha world, and isn’t part of the Saha world, we must still respect that He is also a person, that is why even she rejected the idea of being called a God, because that is how He wanted to be seen, He wanted people to see Him as a real person. And it does not seem the Scriptures refer to His life as a “play”, but perhaps removed from Samsara, as He provides the Dharma for those caught in the Saha world, while Himself outside of it, to help them in His Compassion.

Ardha said:
I've heard teachers recommend a therapist and other professionals for such matters, fully accepting that for such issues you should go to them instead of Buddhist teachers. For "lighter" depression it can help, but for serious and deep depression you need a specialist.

Tata1 said:
Depends on your familiarity with practice. But if you have not build up a foundation before you get the depression it seems difficult to deal with it with buddhism alone

Bristollad said:
I disagree.  I had been a Buddhist for more than thirty years with a strong foundation and practice - it didn't innoculate me from depression nor was it enough on its own.  That's why I agreed with Crazy Wisdom: you have to use as many tools as possible - medication, counselling, walks in nature, "fun" and following the advice of your teachers.  Depression is pernicious and can be deadly.

Malcolm wrote:
Most depression is physically-based, "mind tricks" don't help, but as noted, proper exercise, diet, massage, if necessary, counseling, etc., should all be used.

This is already pointed out in the Saddharmapundarika Sūtra, you should read it sometime:

“Noble ones, the world with its devas, humans, and asuras thinks and believes, ‘Bhagavān Śākyamuni departed from his Śākya clan into mendicancy, went to the preeminent, supreme Bodhimaṇḍa, and attained the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood by the city of Gayā.’ [F.118.b] However, noble ones, I attained the highest, complete enlightenment of buddhahood many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons ago.

And:

“Noble ones, the Tathāgata says to beings with various aspirations, few roots of merit, and many kleśas, ‘Bhikṣus, I am young; I renounced my family and it has not been long, bhikṣus, since I have attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood.’

And:

“Noble ones, whatever the Tathāgata has to do, that is what the Tathāgata does. The Tathāgata, who has attained perfect buddhahood a long time ago, has an immeasurable lifespan. [F.120.a] He always remains and does not pass into nirvāṇa, but creates the appearance of passing into nirvāṇa in order to benefit his students.

And:

“Noble ones,” he continued, “in the same way, although I attained the highest, complete enlightenment of perfect buddhahood countless, innumerable hundreds of thousands of quintillions of eons ago, I sometimes teach as a skillful method such as this in order to guide beings. In this matter, I am not in any way a liar.”

If you assert the Buddha experiences the sufferings and torments of ordinary sentient beings, you contradict your own basic sūtra.

The twelve deeds are only for show. The future buddha, Maitreya, makes the same point of the Mahāyānottaratantra, citing the Lotus Sūtra to this effect.

In the Perfection of Wisdom literature it is said that the Dharma will first go to the direction of West (from India).

The teaching of reincarnation was widely accepted in Europe during the first 500 years of the Common Era:
"The early Christian church accepted the teaching of reincarnation, which was expounded by the Gnostics and by numerous church fathers, including Clement of Alexandria, the celebrated Origen (both 3rd century), and St. Jerome (5th century). Of the three, Origen was the greatest proponent of reincarnation among the early Christian teachers and theologians, and he had the greatest impact." (Reverend Dennis Shipman)

According to Ajahn Brahm the Roman Emperor put a Pope in prison for one year, because he refused to cancel the teaching of reincarnation. After spending a year in prison the Pope agreed to take away this teaching.

All in all, we can say that Edward Conze was a good buddhist.

Malcolm wrote:
All this is irrelevant to the historical fact that the Perfection of Wisdom Sūtras had zero impact on Gnosticism.

And:

Now in this Dhamma and Discipline, Subhadda, is found the Noble Eightfold Path; and in it alone are also found true ascetics of the first, second, third, and fourth degrees of saintliness. Devoid of true ascetics are the systems of other teachers.

Caused by compassion the manifestations of Sambhogakaya and Nirmanakaya (Buddhas and Bodhisattvas) will appear where ever there are people who are willing to know and hear the Dharma. You can read for example  in the Lotus sutra and the Shurangama sutra how Avalokiteshvara sends diverse emanations into the world to help and guide beings. This really happens, it is not merely "metaphorical".

Malcolm wrote:
Perhaps, but "guiding sentient beings" does not render Christianity and so on (assuming they are really teachings of bodhisattvas, which I do not beleive for a second) liberative paths.

Part of the reason is that the Yogacarins brought in more texts and translations and kind of outclassed the Madhyamaka thinkers (who were from an older, smaller, and less textually rich sect) in the Annual Court-Sponsored Doctrinal debates.

But I suspect the real reason is that the Yogacara school was headquartered in a very large and wealthy temple that was connected to House Fujiwara, second only to the Imperial House Yamato in power at the time.

Malcolm wrote:
During the middle period of transmission of Mahayana from India to China, the period from 400 CE and 600 CE, Yogacara was at the very height of its popularity in India. But Madhyamaka made a resurgence in India during the period from 600 to 800, which accounts for the unequivocal adoption of Madhyamaka as the officially sanctioned view of Mahayana in Tibet.

For years I assumed that when one goes for refuge in the triple jewel as a committed lay practitioner, one also soon thereafter would need to take the five lay vows as well.

Most sources sort of imply this without necessarily stating it directly.

Malcolm wrote:
The most comprehensive presentation of which vows an upasāka follows is found in the fourth chapter of the Abhdharmakośabhaṣyaṃ. You receive all the vows merely by goingfor refuge to the Three Jewels. However, one can elect to only follow those vows one feels capable of, beginning with refraining from taking life.

FiveSkandhas said:
Other sources I have been digging into, however, suggest that one need not in fact take any of the five vows.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, there are one vow, two vow, three, vow and full-vow upasākas. This is taught by the Buddha.

FiveSkandhas said:
What, exactly? Or are the vows truly "optional" for Upāsaka and Upāsikā status?

Malcolm wrote:
At minimum, one holds the commitments of refuge and the vow against killing (which really refers to killing humans, but it widely interpreted to cover all creatures).

This is complicated by taking bodhisattva vows. Since bodhisattva vows supersede pratimokṣa vows, whenever the former contradict the latter, the former should be followed and not the latter in order to avoid a bodhisattva downfall. The same applies to Vajrayāna vows.

Buddhist Ethics by Kongtrul has the most detailed presentation.

Yes, we must Love everyone equally, I think that ripens one into Buddhahood. That is why Thich Nhat Hanh is talking about true Love. As for romantic Love, in true Love, “desire”? Well, the longing, the missing of someone, the abstractions, they can all still be there but without attachment or craving, with the skhandas emptied, and a joyous state fulfilled. For example I was once noticing two Buddhist Lovers in a difficult place, but their Love was pure and healing, and it is beyond words to describe here. But the concepts of the Dharma do not fall apart in deep Buddhist romantic Love, they become realized. Buddha laid out a Way for householders to become Enlightened, and it is a wonderful Path.

To me, real true Love is a Vehicle that is by far a guide and is always Buddhist.

Maitri is love only in the sense that one wishes for another person to be happy. That's all maitri means, just as compassion means that one wishes for another person to be free of suffering.

Early buddhism is contrasted with contemporary materialist Indian schools that believed in man having one life terminated by death.

It also avoided positing an atman and becoming a votary of reincarnation; the buddha thus opted for rebirth.

You are right that the salvation element was specific to buddhism, which prescribed an escape from the vortex of an illusory self.

In the Maha-nidana sutra, by shunning the ephemeral world of nama-rupa, consciousness can escape the vortex to fall instead upon nirvana. Theravada later seemed to have strayed from this initial idea by instead favoring "cessation".

But correct me if I am misrepresenting your view. Are you saying that Tathatagarbha Sutras are a subsumed within Prajnaparamita and Madhyamaka and are a sort of palliative, also not offering any further substantial teaching?

Malcolm wrote:
I am saying that the tathāgatgarbha sūtras can be understood to be definitive if they are correctly understood (tathātagarbha as the luminous, original nature of the mind), and if understood incorrectly, provisional in meaning at best (and at worst, an atmanavāda). As they stand, tathāgatgarbha sūtras require interpretation, unlike Madhyamaka and the PP Sūtras.

I am saying that the Lanka and Candrakīrti offer the final word on the subject. The Uttaratantra itself defines tathāgatagarbha as a provisional teaching, in the chapter one, the fourth vajra topic, towards the end, verses 156-160:

Having stated that all knowable things are empty in every aspect, like clouds, dreams, and illusions,
here, the buddhas have stated that the buddha element (buddhadhātu) exists in all sentient beings. 
They have stated this for the purpose of having [sentient beings] abandon five faults: timidity, contempt for inferior sentient beings,
grasping the impure, deriding pure phenomena, and excess attachment to themselves.

While the limit of reality (bhūtakoṭi) is devoid of all compounded aspects, 
the meaning of affliction, karma, and ripening are said to be like clouds, and so on. 
Afflictions are like clouds, karma is like an experience in a dream, 
and ripening of karma and afflictions, the aggregates, are like an illusory emanation. 

Having presented this above, this ancillary or supplemental tantra repeats 
the explanation "the dhātu exists" in order to abandon five faults.

The Uttaratantra's actual goal is to explicate luminosity aka clear light, and its realization.

Thank you. Are you saying that in order to be a Buddhist, you cannot be a materialist and you can not believe in a naive objective reality?

As far as I understand, the only difference is that everything in our world does not have an independent existence and consists of a constant stream of factors that we given names, and the essence of awakening is learning how to look at the world without names, associations and concepts?
Or am I wrong?

What is probably true however is that Tsongkhapa was very influential in 'demoting' the lineage of Maitreya/Asanga below that of Nagarjuna/Madhyamaka, whereas more traditionally these two lineages were seen as equal.

Malcolm wrote:
This is definitely not so.  For example, Sapan, whom you mention above, considered only the Abhisamayālaṃkāra to be definitive. Also Tsongkhapa followed suit.

For example, the Hevajra Tantra explicitly places Yogācara below Madhyamaka, and so on.

First explain Vaibhāṣika,
likewise, Sautrantika,
after that, Yogācara, 
and likewise, Madhyamaka.

Also Sapan held the view that Uttaratantra itself viewed tathāgatagarbha as a provisional doctrine. Not only this, but the scholars of the Imperial Period held that Yogacāra was below Madhyamaka, since they were all students, directly or indirectly, of Santarakṣita.

Tathagatagarbha --- womb or embryo?

It is disputed whether buddha-nature is identical to Tathagatagarbha. Perhaps they both describe the same thing from different angles?

Tathāgatagarbha needs no cultivation... only uncovering, as it is already present and perfect in each being.

(Remember the Sutra about the poor man who in advanced old age found a jewel sewn into his smock. With Incredible surprise, he observed: 'I have been a rich man all this time and I never knew it!')

This points not to a womb (potential) but to an embryo (innate buddha-nature).

Perhaps tathagatagarbha and buddha-nature are different --- but refer to the same thing.
So they are different but not-different:)

If the knower has "parts and components" then we have not explained where the distinction between one part and another comes from. Remember that we were discussing before exactly this point, i.e. where the capacity to "distinguish" actually comes from, and we certainly don't want to end up in a circular argument stating that the "knower distinguishes its components by its capacity to distinguish its components".

But the other option that you suggest is equally dissatisfactory. Mind made of a substance like gold continuously transforming into other appearances yet never losing its substance - well, this does in no way explain how this process of transformation takes place. Is it a capacity of the mind? Is it same as mind? Is it different?

My personal conclusion here is that neither system actually really properly describes things. Formal logic, that's my conclusion, is not suited to properly address these questions. It can take you far, but not to the end.

We are therefore not operating here at a position prior to recognizing discrete entities, the very fact that our minds (citta) are variegated (citra) proves the mind is not an integral entity, proves it is made of parts, and since those cognitions happen sequentially, this proves the mind is also impermanent, momentary, and dependent. So, it is impossible for a conventional knower to be a self.

We have not clarified whether the "knower" here is same or different from the "known" (i.e. its cognitions).

Malcolm wrote:
If the knower were the same as the known, it would have to have parts in order to change. It would have to transform into all the different objects it knows, meaning it is not a self, has parts and components. This is the rebuttal to the Hindu idea you bring up below. You might object, well, what is mind is substance like gold, which can be shaped into ashtray or a statue. You then have to explain to us how this transformation of shape, if you will, occurs.


fckw said:
Besides above point, there's another one I'd like to address briefly, but it's not the main argument on my side. the very fact that our minds (citta) are variegated (citra)
As I'm not a Sanskritist I am not sure I undestand what "variegated/citra" here actually means. There are at least two interpretations, and I am not sure which one you are referring to: Either to state that there are "many minds" in the sense "each individual has its own mind", or to state that "a single mind has many mind events" that are "distinct" from each other. I take it you mean the latter. If that is the case then I am pretty sure there are some 'hindu' school of thoughts arguing that there are in fact no "distinct mind events", but that they are a single stream of "mind stuff continuously morphing into something else".
As far as I'm informed that's actually the position taken in the Patanjali's Yogasutras. It's, by the way, also what you experience if you practice those Patanjali Yogasutra meditations, i.e. the subjective experience along the path is quite different from both Therevada Vipassana as well as Mahamudra/Dzogchen style meditation. But that's just a side note.

Malcolm wrote:
You are talking about Samkhya philosophy which is utilized in the Yogasūtras. The line you are think of yogaḥcittavṛttinirodhaha, "Yoga is the cessation of the transformations of consciousness."

The difference here of course is that in the citta in this case is actually different than the knower (jñā). The knower is termed puruśa, is a passive consumer, and is utterly different than praḳrti, which is where the transformations are occurring. The knower itself never changes, but merely witnesses the transformations of prakṛti. But none of this is what I am talking about.

in Buddhism, it is axiomatically assumed that there are many independent mind streams; this is proven by Dharmakirti in Saṃtānāntarasiddhi, "Proof of Other's Minds."

There is the Theravadin view by some that Gautama isn’t coming back at all, but the Mahayana view from what the Lotus Sutra (The White Lotus of the Good Dharma in Tibetan) has stated is that Buddha, even after Enlightenment, has been in this world for eons. He attained Enlightenment, which it is said in that Sutra, asamkhyas of kalpas ago as Bodhisattva Never Disparaging. The Buddha is in a true extinction, but He Emanates into this entire world from place to place, from time to time, to help guide sentient beings. He is not “born” neither does He “die”, but it appears that way, and often it is written about in such a way in the Suttas, Sutras, and commentaries and books. But what you have stated is correct. He is well gone. And we must do everything we can so that the Buddha will rest in Tranquility. Om. Namaste.

Does the Madhyamakan view differentiate between nominal ultimate truth (understanding) and non-nominal ultimate truth (realization)?

If it does, is it possible that the non-nominal Buddhist realization (enlightenment, I guess?) and 'highest' Vedanta realization (moksha?) are essentially the same? At this 'ultimately ultimate' level of realization, every conceptual edifice, including dependent origination and emptiness, is absent. Yes?

Well, you know what the MMK says:

Without relying on conventional truth, the ultimate truth will not be understood;
without realizing the ultimate truth, nirvana will not be attained.

In other words, paths within or without Buddhism that do not present the conventional correctly cannot properly present the ultimate. If they cannot properly present the ultimate, it cannot be realized, and nirvana cannot be attained.

It is axiomatic that Advaita has an incorrect presentation of the relative. The only correct presentation of the relative is dependent origination. Nāgārjuna wrote the MMK to correct incorrect Buddhist understandings of dependent origination so emptiness could be understood and nirvana realized.

Buddhism does not define “individual minds” as such, but rather discrete, momentary continuums which arise from their own causes and conditions.

This still does not define where the "discretion" comes from or where it resides in. The continua might not have individuality in the sense of the vedic position, that's true, but they are still "particulars" or "discrete" or however we want to call them, i.e. distinct from each other. Hence, there's a "discretization process" at work which remains unexplained.

Malcolm wrote:
Things appear to be discrete, so we label them “discrete.” If things appear to be nondiscrete, we are not able to label them as discrete. For example, from a distance a mountain does not appear to be composed of discrete parts, so we label that appearance “mountain.” When we get closer, we see there are many parts, and what was formally labeled a mountain gets redefined into slopes, peaks, ravines, and so on. When we meet someone, we label that person a self, a person, a living being, but these labels attached to appearances will not bear analysis. It’s the same with mental continuum’s, even the notion of mental continuum will not bear ultimate analysis, but since the cause and result of karma, etc., appear to be discrete, mind streams are, conventionally speaking, discrete, because there is an observable function.. If we wish to aggregate minds, we refer to all consciousnesses as the dhatu of consciousness, just as we refer to aggregated elements as the space dhatu, etc.

It never made much sense to me how Buddhism apparently finds it totally acceptable to assume the definition of "individual minds" while going on and negating the existence of any such thing as jiva, atman and the like.

Malcolm wrote:
Buddhism does not define “individual minds” as such, but rather discrete, momentary continuums which arise from their own causes and conditions. In short, jivas, pudgalas, atmans, etc., do not function as defined by their proponents, so they are negated.

Hi Malcolm!

What is the relationship between the four possibilities of production (causeless, from causes, from themselves, or from both self and other) and dependent arising? The MMK refutes production, but not dependent arising?

Also, isn't dependent arising, along with every other conceptual construct, a provisional teaching that is meaningless at the 'absolute' ultimate level?

Malcolm wrote:
MMK refutes any kind of production other than dependent origination. It is through dependent origination that emptiness is correctly discerned. Without the view of dependent origination, emptiness cannot be correctly perceived, let alone realized. The MMK rejects production from self, other, both, and causeless production, but not dependent origination.  The MMK also praises the teaching of dependent origination as the pacifier of proliferation in the mangalam. The last chapter of MMK is on dependent origination. The MMK nowhere rejects dependent origination, it is in fact a defense of the proper way to understand it. The only way to the ultimate truth (emptiness) is through the relative truth (dependent origination), so if one’s understanding of relative truth is flawed, as is the case with all traditions outside of Buddhadharma, and even many within it, there is no possibility that ultimate truth can be understood and realized.

Jokes aside, I agree with you.

On one hand, we all follow the voice in our heads. Monotheism covers this over with a single pole social structure, as you point out, which can tend to authoritarianism. I actually argued something along these lines over Passover with a group of not particularly theistic Jews. This system has its faults and I suggested this gift the Jews gave to the world has not been particularly good. My argument was not rejected. That said, it's also a very effective social structure for maintaining social cohesion. Exhibit A: the Jewish diaspora. I think Jews have dealt with the weakness in this system by making study and argumentation a part of the tradition - pole a group of rabbis about any particular issues and you're likely to find a variety of answers. But, they also have something deeper binding them in the shared history, even as there are divisions.

Christianity and Islam take the same monotheism and, perhaps because its adherents are not bound to each other by blood, the emphasis ends up on the authority. In that case, disagreements can only end in subjugation or schism.

The specifics of this chart are one thing. The concept it illustrates is more compelling.

Tibetan instruments are never mentioned in the tantras. So it does not matter which one you use.

But when it comes to vajras and bells, and vases, and so on, the production of all these things are very precisely described in lower tantras.

As far as damarus are concerned, they are described in higher tantras. There are two kinds described therein: skull damarus and wood damarus. Generally, it is considered that wrathful rites require the former, while peaceful rites require the latter.

Further, we should understand they are not appropriate to use in rites of the lower tantras, and only should be used in higher tantric rites.

However, there are differences between different schools. Nyingmapas tend to favor skull damarus, Gelugpas wooden ones. Wooden damarus should be made out of sandalwood, red sandalwood, catechu wood, or other non-poisonous woods. There are also precise sizes described for damarus.

As for the drum head, nothing other than skins are prescribed for either kind of damaru.

It's just better to avoid the world "real" in Buddhist parlance. Anything that cannot bear analysis cannot be construed as real in any meaningful sense. Since not even nirvana or the three kāyas can withstand analysis, in the final analysis, Buddhism finds that everything is dependent on conditions, which are also unreal. Hence, everything is unreal, and not real. This is what it means to say everything is empty. To say something is not empty is to say that it is real; to say that something is empty is to say that it is not real.

Although absolute truth/relative truth can be applied to everything, it doesn’t need to be all the time. The whole point of understanding relative/ultimate is as a practice to eliminate attachment by seeing that ultimately nothing can be said to truly exist to which one can attach.

If you take the river
Conventional truth (what occurs) the river Amazon flows.
The Absolute truth (that which exists) is simply the flow of water across the earth. That is, all rivers should be perceived as just streams of water.
If you take a people
Conventional truth:  Every person is composed of the five aggregates, or skandhas: matter, sensation, perception, mental formations and consciousness.
Absolute truth:?
Thanks you!

The Teaching of Akṣayamati:

The sūtras that, with various words, proclaim a self, a being, a life principle, a life-sustaining principle, a spirit, a personality, a human being, a man, a subject that acts, and a subject that feels and those that teach that there is a ruler where there is no ruler are called implicit. The sūtras that teach emptiness, the absence of distinguishing marks, the absence of anything to long for, the unconditioned, the unborn, the unoriginated, the nonexistent, the absence of self, the absence of being, the absence of soul, the absence of person, the absence of spirit, the absence of ruler, and the gates of liberation are called definitive. This is called the reliance on the sūtras of definitive meaning, not on the sūtras of implicit meaning.

Thank you for taking a stab at it.

Yes I'm referring to anything outside Tibetan (Zen for instance) and then outside Mahayana as well.

I'm just confused or uncertain on a lot of this because....if Bodhisattva is the goal of Tibetan Buddhist (Mahayanist) then what happened to the belief that tantra is very fast? Are we then 'delaying' or slowing down the path deliberately? Much like driving a Lamborghini in a school zone? Fast but deliberately slowing it down.

Malcolm wrote:
Common Mahāyāna is too slow. That is why we have Vajrayāna.


Padmist said:
I say that because (a) the belief that tantra is so fast but (b) we follow the Bodhisattva path meaning (c) not going directly to Buddhahood. So if A is so fast but you don't aspire for C right away, then that means there is a deliberate slowing down in the B area. Did I get this right?

Malcolm wrote:
No. In Uncommon Mahāyāna Vajrayāna, one wishes to attain buddhahood as rapidly as possible, and eliminate the lengthy time its takes in the common Mahāyāna path.


Padmist said:
Finally, if the above paragraph is correct, it would seem that there are no enlightened beings. (Unless you count Arahant) Because everyone (Tibetan/Mahayanist) are following the Bodhisattva path, using a very fast vehicle (Tantra) but slowing it down so as not to reach Buddhahood fast. That would seem that no Tibetan Buddhist / Mahayanist are enlightened. Or do I get this whole thing completely wrong?

Yup. completely wrong. Sorry.
