I think your understanding of Theravadin practice is rather skewed too, sorry but its really rather a sweeping statement to suggest what you are.

Malcolm wrote:
If you are referring to the practice of śamatha-bhāvana, etc., it is true that as of the late 19th century, the practice of meditation had died out completely in Śrī Lanka.

It appears that in Burma the practice of meditation in general was revived towards the end of the 19th century by Ledi Sayadaw.

The Forest Tradition in Thailand dates from 1900, founded by Ajaan Mun and Ajaan Sao Kanatasilo.

Unlike Tibetan Buddhism and Chan/Zen, I am not aware that there is a continuous, unbroken tradition of the transmission of meditative praxis in Theravada Buddhism in general.

If you go out to the place where you parked your car, and there's no car there, you have a very vivid experience of 'no car'. That is an absence that has a meaning. Its apprehendable characteristic is absence of what you expected to find - 'no car'.

Malcolm wrote:
This is an implicative negation, the absence of something which exists elsewhere.


Tsongkhapafan said:
Similarly, the apprehendable characteristic of emptiness is 'the absence of all the phenomena we normally see or perceive' or 'lack of inherent existence'.

Malcolm wrote:
The lack of inherent existence is a nonimplicative negation— having been negated, there is no inherent existence somewhere else. Therefore, since the examples to do match, your reasoning is flawed.

Tsongkhapafan said:
If what you say is correct, it would be impossible to do mahamudra meditation which is meditating on a mind that is clarity, completely lacking physical characteristics.

Malcolm wrote:
The pervasion does not apply — the mind has clarity as a characteristic, therefore it is apprehensible.

Of course it does. Buddhists have been meditating on emptiness since Buddha first explained how to.

Malcolm wrote:
Protestations without reasons and appeals to authority show poor reasoning.



Tsongkhapafan said:

An object doesn't need physical qualities in order to be ascertained. A good example is the mind, which is clarity, the absence of physical characteristics. If what you say is true, it would be impossible to do mahamudra meditation.

Malcolm wrote:
Again, you repeat the error you made above. Clarity, as we know from Dharmakirtī, etc., is the characteristic of the mind through which the mind can apprehend itself. Emptiness has no such characteristic through which it may be apprehended. Therefore, it cannot be an object of equipoise.

Luminosity is just the conventional nature of the mind. Why would something that is impermanent (luminosity) which is the conventional nature of the mind (also impermanent) become permanent? It's impossible. A conditioned phenomenon can never become unconditioned. Furthermore an unconditioned phenomenon cannot function, so an unconditioned Buddhahood would be inert and pointless; it would lack the very ability to perform the function for which it was attained - the benefit all living beings.

Of course there is an apex of yānas. For example, Śantideve points out that the ultimate of the lower is the relative of the higher in reference to tenet systems. Thus the view of Vaibhāṣika is lower than that of Sautrantika; the view of Sautrantika is lower than that of Yogacara, the view of Yogacara is lower than that of Madhyamaka and so on.

While indeed it is incorrect to needlessly belittle anyone's path, whether Buddhist or nonBuddhist, it is much worse karma to abandon a higher path for a lower path.

Nothing.

As for his approach. Have you read any of his publicly available books introducing Dzogchen?
The only reason I ask is that if you are sincerely interested in receiving his teachings (and obviously you are at least sincerely interested) then reading some of his books is not too much work AND all of the answers that you've got so far are given in his books, along with the context of explaining his understanding of Dzogchen.

"Dzogchen the self perfected state" is probably my favorite. It is very clear about non-denominational, but it very clearly explains everything.

"Crystal and the way of light" is a little thicker, goes a little deeper into technical stuff and is autobiographical. Really wonderful read!

"Dzogchen teachings" is one that I found in a bookstore early on and found useful even if I didn't understand it all at the time.

I came to Dzogchen from outside of Buddhism, with no interest in it whatsoever.
For me personally I have found it very useful to study more Buddhism, both to understand the culture that the dzogchen teachings come from and to help me in those times that I can't constantly rest in non-dual contemplation.
So, while "Buddhism" is not the main point (although Buddhism main point is the main point, and is contained within the beautiful dzogchen teachings), you could say that my learning dzogchen brought at least one person to the dharma (and I'm sure many others).

Not for Buddhists, no.

Sir, if you have read all my posts in this discussion, I would be surprised if I was not able to clearly express my respectful and sincere motives. I have never questioned his orthodoxy, only trying to establish whether his approach will be compatible with the requirements of my own path. It started with my asking for testimonies as to the quality of Rinpoche’s conduct, in view of the fact that we are asked to carefully scrutinise prospective masters, a need reinforced by the bad examples that occasionally surface in this regard. Then someone said he places no emphasis at all on śīla (but personally behaves respectably), leading to the discussion on that.

There is a perspective where all Dharma works all the time. The late Kalu Rinpoche once said that he saw all the monks as Arhats. From the ultimate perspective the vows they took also always worked and were fully accomplished upon taking them.

So yes, that type of perspective where Dharma always works is present in Vajrayana. That does not meant that the group of monks I was sitting behind were actually Arhats, but that from the ultimate perspective the simultaneous fruition of their practice could be seen--even in the lowly Pratimoksha Vows. There's no such thing as "a little bit pregnant", and on the ultimate perspective there no such thing as "a little bit enlightened". The presence of Dharma at all is the presence of "a little bit enlightened".

But effectively there is a difference.

Yes, one might say that. But the Lord Buddha nevertheless saw it as necessary, given the degenerate condition of mankind in his days. Today mankind has become even more spiritually reduced than in the Śākyamuni’s time. We are not primordial men. The perfect selflessness that would make one spontaneously act with perfect purity without guidance by any formal support may be awakened through long practice, it is not natural and actual in the beginning of the spiritual journey. So that is my own understanding of the matter, anyway. I am certainly not saying everyone must believe as I do.

Tārāmitra said:
I get your meaning, Malcolm. Thank you for your patient explanations.

I am not so much saying that vows as such are required. What I do think is required is clear teachings on śīla, that to be understood in principal depth and interiorised. For example, the precept against theft is more subtle in essence than what is immediately evident, perhaps. It is rather straight forward to avoid shop lifting, for example, but there are far more subtle and hard to detective ways of taking from others, for example by (often impulsively and unconsciously) playing various games of manipulation in order to suck energy from other people.
This is not covered in the precepts. The five precepts only cover physical actions.

It would obviously depend on whether he was in a position to identify the deviation and attempt to correct it.

Rinpoche includes these things because they need to be understood, not because this is how one is to practice. He states in the same book:
However, those who follow Dzogchen teachings on the basis of clear understanding of the fundamental characteristics of the kinds of conduct in the diverse paths should apply themselves until they are able to unify or integrate their essential points in the dimension of the behavior of Samantabhadra of Ati.
And, having been his student for the past 25 years, I really do know his point of view concerning vows. If someone finds being a bhikşu helpful in their practice, then he is all for it. But it is not necessary. It is not even necessary for Dzogchen practitioners to take the five precepts or engage in a refuge ceremony. From his point of view, one begins with direct introduction first, not first taking pratimoksha vows, then bodhisattva vows, then vajrayāna vows and so on.

I certainly accept that my approach to this question is not the only valid one in all cases, but I still hold that it is the safest approach for most contemporaries interested in Dzogchen. Maybe I am mistaken, but that seems to be an open question.

My thanks to Norwegian for his elaborate reply:
Sutra is the path of Renunciation. Tantra is the path of Transformation. Dzogchen is the path of Self-Liberation. All three paths are unique and complete on their own.
Malcolm just said Dzogchen is the essence of Mahayana, which seems somewhat dissonant with this view of three separate self-sufficient vehicles; but Mahayana is basically based on Sutra teachings. Of course, inasmuch as Dzogchen too aims at realising Buddhahood for the sake of all beings, they are the same in essence.

Malcolm wrote:
Dzogchen is the essence of Mahāyāna because it results in the anuttarasamyaksambodhi described in Mahāyāna sūtra.

How about pitfalls? Is it really impossible for a Dzogchen practitioner to have downfalls? Seems unrealistic to me that one is guaranteed success just by being a Dzogchen practitioner. Without any formal ethical supports the danger would seem to be greater.

Malcolm wrote:
One only needs a vow if one has a problem to curb. For example, of you are addicted to killing things, you can take a vow to stop. If you are addicted to stealing and so on, same deal. If you do not engage in taking life, taking what has not been given, lying, and so on, what possible use is a vow to refrain from those things?

A Dzogchen practitioner might observe a vow against drinking if they have a problem with alcohol that causes them to lose their mindfulness. Otherwise, there is no need for that.


Tārāmitra said:
Nobody replied to this question of mine:
To leave the question of śīla up to the disciples seems dangerous. Will not Rinpoche suffer certain consequences if some of his disciples go down wrong paths which they justify to themselves through Dzogchen, and end up in hell-states?

Of course not. Their misconceptions are not his.

What do you mean by established? When he begins a retreat, he always spends an hour or so discussing the essential differences between the paths of renunciation (Hinayāna and common Mahāyāna), the paths of transformation (Vajrayāna), and the path of self-liberation (Dzogchen/Mahāmudra).

Title: Fears mount over scale of Buddhist sect sexual abuse

From the https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/feb/19/buddhist-sexual-abuse-triratna-dennis-lingwood:


Unknown said:
One of the UK’s largest Buddhist orders has been forced to report allegations of sexual abuse after a former follower claimed he was coerced into sex with one of its elders. In a separate development, the group’s founder has apologised for having relationships with its members – some of which, he has previously acknowledged, may have been against their will.

Triratna, which has tens of thousands of followers, is battling to protect its reputation, both in the worldwide Buddhist community and among its own members who are questioning the extent to which the coercion was perpetrated and how long it continued...

It is clear that it was taken seriously across a broad spectrum of Buddhist schools and still is. The Agañña Sūtta does not exist in a Tibetan recension, but the barebones of the story are preserved in Various Mahāyāna sūtras and some śāstras.

It's not clear why that would be the case. If how things usually are for living beings (ie. beset by aging, illness, and death, in their various forms) has any bearing on how things really, ultimately are, then a dog-eat-dog Darwinist scenario (and thus a Christian) one seems most llikely

Coëmgenu said:
Darwinism and Christianity are not often thought of as synonymous. When are Christians taught that they should behave like dogs competing in the wild? I don't follow your characterization here.
“As man advances in civilization, and small tribes are united into larger communities, the simplest reason would tell each individual that he ought to extend his social instincts and sympathies to all members of the same nation, though personally unknown to him. This point being once reached, there is only an artificial barrier to prevent his sympathies extending to the men of all nations and races. [If they appear different] experience unfortunately shews us how long it is before we look at them as our fellow creatures. Sympathy beyond the confines of man, that is humanity to the lower animals, seems to be one of the latest moral acquisitions… This virtue [concern for lower animals], one of the noblest with which man is endowed, seems to arise incidentally from our sympathies becoming more tender and more widely diffused, until they extend to all sentient beings.”

Once we've been given and actually received an empowerment, it is said we've been initiated into or entered into that deity's mandala.  That's a traditional way of speaking about it.  We've been let into the mandala of the deity and are part of the inner circle with our fellow vajra brothers and sisters, whereas the uninitiated are outside the boundaries of the mandala, and certain things shouldn't be shared with them for fear of breaking our samaya and/or being the cause of them giving rise to wrong views.

I explained this to you a long time ago when there was some discussion of what it means to take an empowerment.

In short, the guru generates himself as the mandala of the deity, and then generates the mandala of the deity in front of himself. The latter mandala is the one from which one takes the empowerment. The teacher guides one to the doors of the mandala, and one requests admission. Then, one is allowed inside the mandala and shown all of the details of the mandala. This happens before the vase, secret, prajña's pristine consciousness and word empowerments happen. When the empowerment is over, the guru dissolves both mandalas. (This is why it is impossible to receive empowerments from recordings).

"How things really are is a personal intuition (in the philosophical sense) and cannot be communicated verbally to others, but if you look into your heart and are truly honest, you will know that Jesus is your Lord and Savior."

Whenever I have heard people talk about how things really are, this was always followed by making clear their specific religious or political etc. affiliation.
I have never heard anyone actually stop at "It's deeply personal, it's not possible to talk about it."

Sometimes, there are people who seem to stop at that, but a closer look reveals they are actually refering to something that they don't want to talk about (with the person they're talking to), and that it isn't something that would be impossible to talk about.

Grigoris said:
Actually, political based intolerance (ie expressed through the state) was quite a late development in for Christianity.  Although many would like to believe that the link between Christianity and the state started with the Byzantine Empire, the fact of the matter is that Constantine was a Apollonian (sun worshipper) up until he converted to Christianity on his death bed.

Far from being a Christian Empire the Byzantine emperors allowed for and funded the worship of all "pagan" religions up until the reign of Theodosius I (the last emperor to rule a unified Byzantine Empire) who issued edicts against "pagan" worship in 395AD.  But even with this development the basis for the legal system remained Roman civil law.

But it was Justinian I (482-565AD) that brought about the end, and began the active persecution, of "pagan" religions in the Empire.  It was during his reign that "pagan" temples were destroyed and Christian churches were built on their foundations (many times using materials from the destroyed temples).  Not only did Justinian persecute "pagans" but he also ran crusades against Christian "heresies" and Jews too.  He was the first to use the idea of a single empire be unified under a single (Christian) faith.  It was at this point in history that the pre-Christian European religions were completely wiped out (except for the bits that managed to be absorbed into the new "mainstream" and state sanctioned Christian practice).

I'm not sure I understand.

What do you see as an alternative to both solipsism as well as to authoritarian cognitive externalism (to call it somehow -- "absolute facts which exist separately from how people cognize them")?

One of the alternatives to that could be a kind of epistemic universalism coupled with an unquestioning regard for every human, regardless of the state the human is in. Ie. basically granting that every human is essentially sane and can know "how things really are" without an external party posing as an epistemic authority.

In all Buddhist traditions, are devāḥ considered, universally, in the Buddhavacana, to only have 2 of the 5 "human/sentient?" aggregates?

If devāḥ lack the 5 aggregates, what are the five aggregates, are they only the aggregates of human/"human-realm" beings? Do hell-dwellers have all 5 aggregates?

Is there a level of karmic attainment where someone is not "burdened" with 5 aggregates? Does having "all 5" aggregates "help" someone realize the Buddhadharma? Is being born a "human" a "higher birth" than being born a deva, with "higher birth" meaning "a birth that is more conducive to practicing Buddhadharma"? Many Buddhist cosmologies count being "born human" as the most beneficent birth for pursuing Buddhadharma, are they wrong?

makewhisper said:
This is a broad topic. And I'm not sure what I'm asking. But I hope some knowledgable practitioners can discuss the place of the body and of the perception of sensation in the realization of instant presence.

I'm very new to Dzogchen, and the more I practice GY or semdzin, the more I feel limited by my own body. For example, when I  notice various sensations in specific parts of my body—the vibration of the sound in my head, the "contraction" in my experience after I've come to the end of my breath etc. But it seems that in automatically noticing these sensations I'm reinforcing the dualistic sense that I have a body that is experiencing a sensation. I feel trapped by my perception of sensation, and this instant presence of which I have no knowledge, seems further and further off the edges of my experience.

How does someone with no knowledge of
rigpa deal with the perception of sensation in practice? What practices are recommended?

One has to learn how to integrate them by not regarding them as other or distractions. If you experience any otherness your experience is automatically dualistic even though your state never is.

(P.215, •138)

(Of course, it is true that zhentong as sometimes presented in non-Jonang contexts is not identical with the Omniscient Dolpopa’s.)

But anyway, was Rinpoche’s claims generally true at that time? Has the situation changed since then?

Though I have not encountered them in sūtra literature in Sanskrit or Chinese, what I have said is not exclusive of them.

Malcolm wrote:
The Sambhogakāya has five certainties: time, teaching, teacher, place, retinue. The time is always. The teaching is Mahāyāna. The teacher is Vairocana. The place is Akaniṣṭha Ghandavyuha. The retinue is buddhas and bodhisattvas.

This not a Tibetan idea, this is throughout Mahāyāna in Indian texts.

No, since your vow of refuge is not dependent on the five precepts. The only way to lose your vow of refuge is to declare that you are no longer a disciple of the Buddha.

Hi,

Sorry, this a lengthy message I hope some of you will take the time to read it, you might find it interesting. For me it is of great spiritual import so I hope you will persevere to get to the nub of the issue. Anyway, it needs some explaining and also some context to communicate a very painful experience I have had recently that has caused a lot of suffering to myself, and any advice for its treatment.

Now 46 years of age, I’m a male Buddhist that started practising back in 2002 upon reading "The Art of Happiness". Up until 9 months months ago I have been mostly very grounded, strongly intuitive man who has not suffered any mental health issues of any kind, except a few shortish periods of mild depression, not unusual. Having stated this, it should be noted that I suffered a deeper depressive period around 2009, a family breakdown and a few short but fairly extreme periods of alcoholic drinking, part of my past. Besides these periods I have always been engaged with continued spiritual practice although lost a bit of connection at times to my Buddhist roots.

Leading up to May last year I feel that I have suffered a loss of mental clarity and that the 3 Jewels were a bit distant which allowed me to make an uncharacteristically bad decision to join a "Shamanic" style retreat where participants take a psychotropic substance as part of the retreat practice. Without naming the substance I can say that it is a very powerful hallucinogen and has started to become popular with westerners not only visiting South America to attend these type of retreats but are now appearing in first world countries like mine, Australia.

During the retreat on the first night when I took the substance and it started to come on, I had a massive electric/energetic jolt that seemed to originate in my heart centre and knocked me out of my chair. At the same time I saw in my mind's eye/visualised a silver cord retreat up into a dark sky. Just prior to this I also visualised red clouds (blood?) in my mind's eye billowing and dark.  After this event I continued to meditate and notice a lot of feelings and energy releases moving up through the body mostly from my Solar Plexus energy centre.

The second night we took the substance again and not long after the effect started to come on I entered a highly anxious state and felt like this whole thing was an entrapment and that the leader of the retreat was a sorcerer. Understandably this could be thought of as a paranoid episode and the continuing experience that night was the most horrific thing that had happened to me in my life up to that point. I ran from the retreat for fear of my life and had this horrifying feeling that I had been permanently cut off from the Dharma and enlightenment. I was eventually picked up by an ambulance and spent the night in a hospital under surveillance. A lot more could be said of my experience that night but this is already a long read.

The next day I was ok and returned to the retreat to say goodbye and go home as the retreat was over. I was OK for about 1 week then the horrifying thoughts and feeling returned to my mind, they did abate though after talking at length with my Buddhist teacher. The thoughts returned again a few days later for a period of hours, then went again after talking to another friend. By 3 weeks after the retreat I was dealing with constant horrifying thoughts that I had been permanently cut off from the possibility of spiritual advancement. These thoughts were strengthened as my mind kept returning to the vision of the cord retreating into the sky and a sense that my Pineal Gland may have been damaged, this is said to be the seat of consciousness and ‘connection to the heavens’.

Only a week later, the thoughts in my head reached a crescendo and I went into a paranoid psychosis by definition, after arriving home from an intensely mentally stressful day I saw people chasing me and feared for my life, this began a psychotic bender over about 4 days. I say psychotic as this would be the definition, but the events I experienced were not just hallucinations and mental aberration of some type, some of the things I experienced were verifiably real.

I can share more specifics with anyone who is interested in private message/chat or even on Skype but that is enough for now.

My main aim here is to seek some advice about what my main fear is, which is this silver cord is real and it is how we receive spiritual nourishment or connect more with it, and that mine has been cut, since then I have had hellish experiences, cut off from the heavens, am I damned to some sort of hell? Is there something I can specifically do to repair/reconnect/develop/maintain the source connection. Recently I have been able to start reconnecting with some of my formal practices and can feel some light and lightness, but there are definitely differences in my mind since the event. My ability to visualise is now greatly impaired, short term memory is also impaired, my heart centre also seems to be ‘offline’. Also I have lots of dark thoughts and sometimes ones that don’t really feel like they are coming from me. I am aware of the obsessional and paranoid aspects, but this is alleviated somewhat by my Sangha connections and Vajrasattva practice.

Any helpful comments are welcomed.

Love.

Title: Re: if we are Buddhas are we the 3 Kayas
Content:
smcj said:
As far as the 3 Kayas go, they are: 1.the non-manifest essential enlightenment of a Buddha (Dharmakaya), 2.the communication of a Buddha manifesting (Sambhogakaya), and 3.the physical presence of a Buddha manifesting (Nirmanakaya). So technically your "Kayas" are presently being expressed as your body, speech, and mind. Essentially they can be said to be present as Kayas. Some Tibetan authors (Dolpoba) see it that way. Effectively however that is at best a moot point. Their manifestations are limited by unawareness.

Zhen Li said:
I am not sure about the idea of a 'latent' sambhogakaya or nirmanakaya. As I understand it (coming from a non-tantric perspective), both sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya are illusory, like conditioned experience. They're devices employed by a fully awakened Buddha to help beings. The only buddhakaya that we have prior to attaining buddhahood, or the tenth bhumi as a bodhisattva, is the dharmakaya. In the end, that is the only kaya we have, but it has multiplicity from the perspective of deluded beings..

Next week, as Greece settles into the presidency of the European Union, Milan Milutinovic, Serbia's recently retired president, will be brought before the war crimes tribunal at The Hague. Greek involvement in the atrocity, as well as other secrets Athens would prefer buried, could be revealed when the 60-year-old testifies...


A Dutch documentary investigating Greek complicity in the Serb wars was aired on local television in which a director of the semi-official Athens News Agency, Nikolas Voulelis, admitted to widespread censorship. During the wars the Greek media was fanatically pro-Serb, portraying Yugoslav Muslims as 'infidel Turks' bent on destroying their Orthodox brethren. 'Editorial interference was a given,' he said.

“The whole of Greece knows that the Greek volunteers had the broad support of Greek society as a whole as well as the support of politicians, mainly belonging to PASOK, because of the warm friendship between Andreas Papandreou and Radovan Karadzic.

Greece starts probe into Srebrenica massacre
27 Jun 2005 11:09:59 GMT

Source: Reuters

By Karolos Grohmann

ATHENS, June 27 (Reuters) - An Athens prosecutor launched a preliminary investigation on Monday to determine whether Greeks took part with Bosnian Serbs in the 1995 massacre of up to 8,000 Muslims in Srebrenica.

The slaughter of the unarmed men and boys taken by the Bosnian Serb army from the U.N. protected area at Srebrenica was Europe's worst atrocity since World War Two.

Greek Justice Minister Anastasios Papaligouras said in parliament on Friday Greek citizens may have taken part in the atrocity but ruled out that they were members of the country's armed forces.

An unspecified number of Greek citizens volunteered to join fellow Orthodox Christian Serb forces fighting in the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s, saying they volunteered to support their "Orthodox brothers" in battle.

"A preliminary investigation is already under way by the prosecutor ... to determine whether there were Greek nationals involved in this," a Justice Ministry official told Reuters.

"Obviously this will not be a short investigation. It will not take just a few weeks. It will be longer than that."

The investigation, coming before the massacre's 10-year anniversary on July 11, was triggered by a Greek deputy's question to the country's justice minister to probe the matter of Greek participation in the massacre.

At the time, several of the Greek volunteers openly talked about their missions in the Greek media, but there had never been any mention of involvement in the Srebrenica massacre.

Greece, which traditionally has had better ties with Serbia and formerly with Yugoslavia than any of its other Balkan neighbours, was one of the strongest opponents of the NATO-led bombing campaign against Serbia during the 1999 Kosovo war.

While Belgrade has yet to officially acknowledge its support of Bosnian Serb forces during the Bosnian war, compelled by unrelenting Western pressure, the Bosnian Serb parliament earlier this year admitted the scale of the Srebrenica atrocity and Bosnian Serb responsibility for it.

Malcolm wrote:
And:

kirtu said:
TAKIS MICHAS: Yes. First of all Mr. Vitalis explicitly admits that Greeks (i.e. himself) took part in the planning and execution of the Serb “re-occupation” (as he calls it) of Srebrenica. As he says in his press statement “I was present with a group of senior Serb officers in all the operations for the re-occupation of Srebrenica by the Serbs”.

Secondly, Mr Vitalis admits that the recruitment of Greek volunteers for the war against the legitimate government of Bosnia took place with the implicit approval of the leading Greek politicians Andreas Papandreou and (to a lesser extent) Constantine Mitsotakis. As he puts it:
“The whole of Greece knows that the Greek volunteers had the broad support of Greek society as a whole as well as the support of politicians, mainly belonging to PASOK, because of the warm friendship between Andreas Papandreou and Radovan Karadzic. They also enjoyed the support of New Democracy, through the friendly diplomatic initiatives of Constantine Mitsotakis.”

It has both epistemic and ontological ramifications. Its epistemic ramification is that belief in a self is a false belief since there is no entity which can be taken as a self. Its ontological ramification is that questions of being and nonbeing are strictly conventional.

That being said, Buddhadharma certainly has a metaphysics, such doctrines as karma, rebirth, and so on are metaphysical in nature. Abdhidharma deals with many metaphysical issues, such as the nature of time, the nature of causality, and so on. The literature of the Prajñāpāramita deals with the metaphysics of the bodhisattva path and so on.

I have never heard of this explanation of the first Buddha in the Lotus school.

The difference may be that Samantabhadra seems to be asserted as Dharmakaya only. I may be wrong. I don't know enough about it. I am only discussing this as way to illustrate what seems to be asserted in the Lotus schools.

Thanks for replying, but honestly that goes a bit over my head at the moment.

Do not many Dzogchenpas sympathise with the Zhentong view at least insofar as Madhyamaka is concerned? Likewise Dzogchen is a part of the Jonang instructions, though practice of Vajrayoga is more universal within that tradition.

Malcolm wrote:
Some Dzogchenpas may, but it is nowhere near universal. Longchenpa states quite clearly that the view of Dzogchen and the view of Prasanga Madhyamaka are compatible.

Vidyavajra said:
The eminent Dzogchen masters that were also the instigators of the Rimé movement were at least highly approving of zhentong (see ‘The Buddha from Dolpo’ for more information on this). Jonang ‘maha-madhyamaka’ embraces both zhentong and rangtong as sides of the same coin anyway.

Malcolm wrote:
There is no such thing as rang stong. This is a strawman position that gzhan stong pas invented with which to contrast their view.

In the 15th century, Gorampa Sonam Senge, a major Sakya critic of gzhan stong view, pointed out that in Vajrayāna it does not matter very much what sutrayāna view one holds because the actual view one practices is based upon the experience introduced in the fourth empowerment.

Khyentse Wangpo, in light of this fact, therefore treated all version of madhyamaka equally, presenting the freedom from extremes view, the other emptiness view, and the view of Tsongkhapa side by side without making ant preferential statements as to which he preferred.

Vidyavajra said:
For example, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu has, several times over the years, explained why gzhan stong view is incompatible with Dzogchen. It mainly has to do with the gzhan stong assertion that qualities are already fully formed within sentient beings, not as mere potentials which can manifest.
Just out of curiosity, have you studied any full-length works of Dolpopa yourself, or Taranatha’s elaborations on the matter?

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, and Śakya Chogden, Kongtrul, Tsongkhapa, Kedrupje, etc., etc.

Vidyavajra said:
I respect Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, but I don't take him as a final authority on this question when clearly other views on the matter are legitimate too.

Malcolm wrote:
In terms of masters both living and present, no one is in a position to argue with Norbu Rinpoche about whether or not gzhan stong view is ultimately compatible with Dzogchen practice. Suffice it to say that the Dzogchen view of the basis holds that it is utterly empty of all extremes and is not itself something real. The qualities of the buddha are not manifest in the basis, and as such, this is rejected in the first of the six faulty argument concerning the basis, which is a standard presentation in Dzogchen Man ngag sde.

It is sufficient to take Longchenpa as the final authority on the matter. Longchenpa proclaimed that Prasangika was the definitive madhyamaka view; he also proclaimed that the tathāgatagarbha sūtras were definitive. Doesn't this make him a gzhan stong pa? No. The primary reason is that he eschewed the gzhan stong attempt to reconcile the three natures with the two truths. The latter point in fact is the where gzhan stong position goes astray.

Vidyavajra said:
The distinction you point out does not seem to be if great consequence as far as actual realization is concerned. It's mainly petty bickering about how to verbalise and conceptualise the same truth in the most precise way.

Malcolm wrote:
No, there are serious flaws in the gdzhan stong presentation of the three natures which contradict the way they are explained by Maitreyanatha, Asanga, and Vasubandhu. You should read http://wordpress.tsadra.org/?p=1215. He is perhaps on the world's leading expert on gzhan stong and is Indian antecedents.

We can argue the relative merits of this sūtrayāna point of view or that one, but they are all the same in so far as they are intellectual analysis and in the end do not actually lead anywhere except to endless proliferation. At a certain point, they must be dropped and abandoned so that one can enter the experiential view gained in the fourth empowerment/direct introduction/pointing out.

Basically, there are two (or more) notions: Buddhahood is without time, from the perspective of Buddhahood, there has never been delusion, because Awakening is retroactive:
Malcolm wrote:
As for obscurations, they are not real, substantial things that need to removed, like a stain from clothes. As the famous Haribhadra points out, when one achieves buddhahood, one understands one was never deluded all along. As Maitreyanath states, "Nothing here to add, nothing here to remove."
I think what is confusing is your use of the term "retroactive."

Buddhas do not live in time. They do no perceive time. Time is a relative cognition. Buddhas have no relative cognitions. Nevertheless, conventionally, buddhas arise in time, and at one time there was a moment when every buddha was not a buddha, including Buddha Samantabhadra, the so called "adi-buddha." This is why in Dzogchen teachings we talk generically about a time when buddhahood has not been realized and there were no deluded sentient beings.

Greetings all,

A while ago, I proposed a thought-experiment based on a surface-level, or literalist, reading of the description of the Buddha's Awakening and Buddhic Lifespan based on Chapter 16 of the Lotus Sutra, which declares one (or both) of the following readings (or neither, to cover myself if my wrongness in these speculative interpretations is irreconcilable with any mainstream Buddhology).

1) the Awakening of the Buddha is retroactive, having never occurred once it has occurred, as much of a contradiction that may seem, speaking on terms of general conventionality. It is in this way that Buddhahood is beginningless.

2) the Awakening of the Buddha is non-retroactive, thus is temporal, and is fundamentally tied to the conditions and historical reality of a certain moment in time, perhaps even a certain specific and particular experienced dharma, most likely the particular asamskrta (unconditioned) dharma of nirvana itself. Chapter 16 merely labels the experience of the asamskrta-dharma as occurring "measureless" time before because the amount of time that has passed, since the asamskrta-dharma-experience, is uncountable by anyone or anything on account of the sheer size of the number, for no other reason. Since the beginning of this Buddhahood, as a date/time, is unknowable, it falls beyond the purview of the "All" as outlined in, say, the Sabbasutta of the Páli nikáya-literature, and thus cannot be said to exist. It is in this way that Buddhahood is beginningless.

Which one of these readings (or neither) seems more likely?

Thanks for replying, but honestly that goes a bit over my head at the moment.

Do not many Dzogchenpas sympathise with the Zhentong view at least insofar as Madhyamaka is concerned? Likewise Dzogchen is a part of the Jonang instructions, though practice of Vajrayoga is more universal within that tradition.

Malcolm wrote:
Some Dzogchenpas may, but it is nowhere near universal. Longchenpa states quite clearly that the view of Dzogchen and the view of Prasanga Madhyamaka are compatible.

For example, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu has, several times over the years, explained why gzhan stong view is incompatible with Dzogchen. It mainly has to do with the gzhan stong assertion that qualities are already fully formed within sentient beings, not as mere potentials which can manifest.

I don't think the view I expressed regarding Buddhahood is pessimistic. For the bodhisattva, it does not matter how long it will take to completely manifest Buddhahood, because he realizes that Samsara and Nirvana are just expressions of the same Reality. We are aware that we already live through Enlightenment, the entire long, hard quest is real only on the relative and illusory level, so we do not feel trapped in this quest or craving for immediate release. Completely manifested Buddhahood will come in its time, and meanwhile we do what we do in utter freedom.

But look, which masters alive today do actually claim to be total Buddhas? Which of these many Buddhas is the Buddha Maitreya? Perhaps this guy, who does claim to be a Buddha superior even to Shakyamuni?

Here's a passage that seems relevant, from Thinley Norbu's "Echoes": In the Nyingma tradition, saving all sentient beings from suffering is described in terms of one’s own perception. This means that the field that we experience as “other” is based on the perception of a “self,” and social experience is based on individual experience. This does not make individual experience or the individual himself any more important, however, and individual perception remains erroneous. But if one can recognize fundamental awareness, the basis of one’s own perception, one can transform individual experience into wisdom and therefore attain realization. With the attainment of this freedom of wisdom, there is no longer any erroneous projection of an external world. Ceasing to project an erroneous external world is called “saving all sentient beings from suffering in terms of one’s own perception.”

Thank you for your reply, Malcolm.

Are there other reasons also for your opinion that Dzogchen is more profound aside from its lack of the two stages anuttarayogatantra approach?

Regarding Mahamudra, I was of the impression that it still is more closely related to Kalacakra Vajrayoga than Dzogchen since it is anuttarayogatantra?

I get what you’re saying about the view, but even amongst Jonangpa practitioners an often recurring question seems to be about the exact difference in view between Dzogchen and the tradition of their own school, meaning that it is not always so obvious. See for example:

http://www.jonangfoundation.org/blog/dzogchen-zhentong

Malcolm wrote:
Kalacakra and other niruttara systems reply on relative nāḍīs and bindus; Dzogchen relies on ultimate nāḍīs and bindus.

Jonang errs in holding that the basis is only naturally perfect. They do not accept that the basis is intrinsically empty as well as naturally perfect. The Dzogchen view of the basis is is called "great original purity," in other words, the basis is both intrinsically empty and naturally perfected.

"Dalai Lama speaks on Nyingma Dzogchen (Nature of the Mind) 2009"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWvY-05OA90

HHDL mentions:

Such an approach, where a vast body of literature is taken as individual instructions for practice, is also possible, for example, in regard to the Seven Treasuries of Longchenpa. I normally recommend that those who wish to practice Dzogchen proceed by first studying Longchenpa’s Treasury of Philosophical Tenets, to follow that with study of his Treasury of the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, and then to move to his Mind at Ease, part of his so-called Trilogy on Being at Ease.

There is a custom of engaging in the study and practice of this latter text over a period of 145 days.

From that point one proceeds to Longchenpa’s Treasury of the Supreme Vehicle and then to his Treasury of the Ultimate Expanse. This represents a very systematic and holistic approach to the study of Dzogchen. My more general point here is that it is very important to have an overall understanding of the basic framework of the Buddhist path. Of course, some fortunate individuals with positive karmic imprints from previous lives may be able to generate spiritual realization spontaneously by way of a tailored instruction from an experienced master. Such individuals are called “exceptional.” But generally, for most practitioners, it is better to have this broad understanding of the structure of the whole Buddhist path and to engage in specific practices on the basis of that understanding.
Anyone know about this custom of study and practice for 145 days please?

I've had a quick look online and in some books but couldn't find anything specifically related

Thank you

The best we can say is that he doesn't represent the kind of Islam that we like. And who does? I reckon someone like Maajid Nawaz is close, and as such should be encouraged rather than demonised.

World security is threatened by people not seeing where dangers lie. Those on the left seem to view the world as a lovely place were it not for US imperialism, the British empire and (shhh...) the jews.[/quote]

This is a ridiculous characterization of the left, completely false in every respect.

My suggestion would be to wake up and empower liberal muslim voices like Maajid Nawaz rather than put him on a stupid list.
My suggestion is that we start to see terrorism as a politically motivated crime, rather than a feature of a culture war. When we go down the latter road, we are just pouring kerosine on the fire.

Islamic antisemitism stretches back to Khaybar, way before the modern state of Israel.

Also, looking at the lives of privilege of many Jihadists, enjoying wealth, education and opportunities that western democracies afford, I think the narrative of the poor disadvantaged Muslim killing jews because of poverty is a myth,
Germans had to invent the Jews as an evil force, because there were so few of them in Germany. It is similar today with Israel and its conflict with Muslims. There are not that many jews in the world, but they do a lot of heavy lifting in terms of being targets. But when you look at who engaging in antisemitic acts in Europe and England, it is indeed mainly people from North Africa, Pakistan, etc. And they are not exactly the topic of the social heap. Here in the US, most antisemitism is carried out by whites.

Moreover, Islamic/Jewish relations have been punctuated with far more tolerance and openness that Christian/Jewish relations. The antisemitism of the Islamic world today was invented in Europe. Muslims have just adopted the themes (Rothschild, Elders of Zion). Why? Because the Muslim world itself had to borrow antisemitism from Europe.

Israel continued in 2015 to enforce severe and discriminatory restrictions on Palestinians’ human rights, and to build unlawful settlements in and facilitate the transfer of Israeli civilians to the occupied West Bank. Israeli authorities also arbitrarily detained peaceful Palestinian demonstrators, including children.

There was a sharp rise in killings and injuries related to Israeli-Palestinian hostilities beginning in October. Overall, Palestinians killed at least 17 Israeli civilians and 3 Israeli soldiers, and injured 87 Israeli civilians and 80 security officers in the West Bank and Israel as of November 27. Israeli security forces killed at least 120 and injured at least 11,953 Palestinian civilians in West Bank, Gaza, and Israel as of the same date, including bystanders, protesters, and suspected assailants.

...

Neither Israeli nor Hamas authorities have prosecuted anyone for alleged crimes committed during the 2014 Israel-Gaza war, which, according to the UN, killed 1,462 Palestinian civilians, including 551 children, and 6 civilians in Israel, including one child. Israel and Egypt have maintained their partial but highly damaging closure of Gaza’s borders, an unlawful act of collective punishment; they impeded the rebuilding of Gaza’s devastated economy by severely restricting exports from Gaza.

Yet the new anti-Semitism flourishing in corners of the European Muslim community would be impoverished without the incorporation of European fascist tropes. Dieudonné M’bala M’bala, a comedian of French Cameroonian descent who specializes in Holocaust revisionism and gas-chamber humor, is the inventor of the quenelle, widely understood as an inverted Nazi salute. His followers have taken to photographing themselves making the quenelle in front of synagogues, Holocaust memorials, and sites of past anti-Jewish terrorist attacks. Dieudonné has built an ideological partnership with Alain Soral, the anti-Jewish conspiracy theorist and 9/11 “truther” who was for several years a member of the National Front’s central committee. Soral was photographed not long ago making the quenelle in front of Berlin’s Holocaust memorial.

The union of Middle Eastern and European forms of anti-Semitic expression has led to bizarre moments. Dave Rich, an official of the Community Security Trust, a Jewish organization that monitors anti-Semitism in the United Kingdom, wrote recently: “Those British Muslims who verbally abuse British Jews on the street are more likely to shout ‘Heil Hitler’ than ‘Allahu akbar’ when they do so. This is despite the fact that their parents and grandparents were probably chased through the very same streets by gangs of neo-Nazi skinheads shouting similar slogans.”

The marriage of anti-Semitic narratives was consummated in January of last year, during a so-called Day of Rage march in Paris that was organized to protest the leadership of the French president, François Hollande. The rally drew roughly 17,000 people, mostly far-rightists but also many French Muslims.

But we must make a hard distinction between political violence and religions.

It still exists, though under assault from by the social conservatives for decades. If people are not discriminating they will come to an irrational distrust of the press, from whom ironically they gain all their information with which they distrust the press.

Insisting that minorities be granted the simple dignity of not being subjected to racist and discriminatory words and deeds is not politically correct. It is simply correct.

People become angry about what they term "political correctness" because they feel unfairly judged for their racist and sexist instincts. Too bad.

The left may be down and out for the time being, but this is not a permanent state of affairs.

But if we permit our capitalist culture to destroy world civilization due to our own greed and jealously, one hopes there will still be people left over to pick up the pieces and start again. If not, I hope that life on earth continues to evolve in all its beauty, even if no humans remain to enjoy it.

Finally, shouting down someone like Milo is hardly a sin. I suspect it is in fact a virtue.

P.S. Some asshole from Michigan yesterday suggested that the way to deal with the campus protests was to have another Kent State. Threatening to shoot students is really not an appropriate way to deal with political correctness on college campuses. A much more troubling phenomena than political correctness on campuses is allowing college campus deans to adjudicate rape cases to keep them out of the course system.

For Sakyapas, as indeed for Nyingma and Kagyu as well,with respect to the "nature body" aka svabhākaya, in Vajrayāna practice is simply the fact that the three kāyas are an inseparable unity, while in the sūtra presentation it is generally understood to be synonym of the dharmakāya. Your presentation is an adaptation of Haribhadra's interpretation of the svabhāvakakāya to Vajrayāna, but I am not really certain it is appropriate to mix up sūtra and tantra in this way.

As Malcolm noted, Milarepa practiced Varahi and Samvara.  When asked by a disciple what his yidam was, his reply was that he relied on "the little red one."  That's not just a reference to Vajravarahi.

Mila's practice is hard to fathom, but he was a practitioner of the Six Yogas of Naropa, and especially of Tummo.  When we Kagyupas speak of Mahamudra, we mean something different, though our Mahamudra can, and ideally should, encompass the two stages as well.  My tradition includes the instructions of the Karma Kagyu, which includes Dzogchen and Mahamudra, and of the Shangpa Kagyu, which has its tradition of "Clear Light Mahamudra" that is quite different in some respects.  But I don't want to talk about techniques, etc., here or in public, in general.  My questions were directed at the nature of this "very subtle mind," and it's relationship to Buddha Nature, and to, perhaps, "primordial Buddha."  In a sense, all practice, including the Six Yogas practices of Clear Light, which are actually "night-time" practices, and the main yogas of Tummo and Illusory Body, are means to recognize the Nature of Mind, and not merely a direct cognition of emptiness, though that is one aspect of the experience as I understand it.

Second, Trump lost the election not just by 2.8 million votes that went to Clinton. He also lost the 6 million votes that went for Johnson and Stein.

A salient point.  It's not as exciting (especially to the Tibetan people) without the Second Buddha from Oddiyana, admittedly.

Songtsen Gampo didn't have contact with him either, but he had the acclaim of being the first Dharma King, with him seen as Tibet's patron deity Chenrezik and his two princess-brides being Tara and Bhrikuti Devi (which later became White Tara and Green Tara).

Would you agree, though, Malcolm, that Ralpachen's role was crucial in establishing the Dharma in Tibet?  Perhaps it isn't as sexy as building the Jokhang or inviting Guru Rinpoche, but he sure had a lot of temples built, and got some major portions of the canon translated from Sanskrit to Tibetan.

Do we have records of who he invited to do the translations, and what they translated?  That would be interesting to know, and any sources would be much appreciated.

One cannot prove any text to be spoken by the Buddha. This is why, when challenged over the doctrine of the bardo, Vasubandhu simply states, "merely because you do not read it does not mean it is invalid." This is his response to the charge that this or that text is not Buddhavacana.

This is why my response to you is that merely because you do not read this or that text, does not invalidate it. Moreover, just as Nāgārjuna warned Hinayanists who criticized Mahāyāna it was better oif they merely put it aside without criticizing it, likewise too, you would be better off putting Dzogchen aside without criticizing it.

As for obscurations, they are not real, substantial things that need to removed, like a stain from clothes. As the famous Haribhadra points out, when one achieves buddhahood, one understands one was never deluded all along. As Maitreyanath states, "Nothing here to add, nothing here to remove."

No, the Buddha said this in The Questions of Kāśyapa:
"If sentient beings are buddhas by nature, just what is the difference between buddhas and sentient beings? 

‘They both differ not in nature, but differ by virtue of realization and non-realization.’
The Hevajra Tantra states:
Sentient beings are buddhas, 
but they are temporarily obscured by taints—
when removed, they are buddhas.
This is why sentient beings do not need a prediction for buddhahood. The anuyoga tantra, Sarvatathāgata-citta-jñāna-guhyārtha-garbha-vyūha-vajra-tantra-siddhi-yogāgama-samāja-sarvavidyāsūtra-mahāyānābhisamaya-dharmaparyāya-vivyūha-nāma-sūtra, states:
With respect to seeing or not seeing
natural, primordial buddhahood—
that is not seen in inferior conditions,
it is seen in superior conditions.

I just did give a scriptural source, The Realms and Transformations of Sound Tantra. Then there is the Kulyarāja Tantra (D 828) (Sarvadharma-mahāśanti-bodhicittakulayarāja), which is in all bka' 'gyurs. This tantra mentions Śākyamuni Buddha in chapter thirty-four in which it is explained that Kulyarāja, the teacher of all teachers, encompasses the mind of Samantabhadra, Vajrasattva, the seven buddhas including Śākyamuni, the 1002 buddhas of the Bhadrakalpa, and buddhas no matter where they are or when they are. The transcendent state of all the buddhas that has always been naturally perfected from the beginning in the dimension of the unconditioned, all-pervading dharmadhātu is equal with space. In other words, the three kāyas of all the victors are contained within the mind of perfect realization (byang chub sems, bodhicitta) which generates everything.

There is also the Sarvatathāgata-citta-jñāna-guhyārtha-garbha-vyūha-vajra-tantra-siddhi-yogāgama-samāja-sarvavidyāsūtra-mahāyānābhisamaya-dharmaparyāya-vivyūha-nāma-sūtra, Sarvatathāgatacittaguhyajñānārthagarbha-krodhavajrakula-tantra-piṇḍārthavidyāyogasiddhi-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra, Śrī-guhya-garbha-tattva-viniścaya,Devījāli-mahāmāyā-tantra-nāma and the Śrī-heruka-karuṇākrīḍita-tantra-guhya-gaṃbhīra-uttama-nāma.

All of these tantras, which all exist in the bka' 'gyur, all teach Dzogchen.

Then there is the Bodhicittamahāsukhāmnāya composed by Atisha, D 1696, which is text explaining the view and meditation of Dzogchen, which supports the view of the Nyinthig tradition that Atisha attained his realization through practicing the Great Perfection.

This discussion is way over my head, so pardon me for interrupting. But here’s what it sounds like to me. Am I missing the point?

Shakyamuni sat down as an ordinary being but arose as a buddha. The crossing over into enlightenment occurred for Shakyamuni under the bodhi tree, but the pristine mind of the buddha who arose cannot be understood with any reference to time.

Malcolm wrote:
No, Mahāayāna doxology in general maintains that Śākyāmuni is a nirmanakāya, a manifestation of the sambhogakāya Vairocana. It is accepted in all Mahāyāna schools that Śākyamuni Buddha's 12 deeds were merely a display, a mere show to inspire sentient beings. Indeed, that his entire career explained in the Jataka tales, offering his body to the starving tigress, residing in Tuṣita Heaven as the deva Svetaketu, and even his very first moment of bodhicitta in hell was merely a dramatic display for sentient beings.

The one Indian commentary we have on the Lotus Sūtra suggests that references in the sūtra to the nirmanakāya's longevity and so on are to be understood as attributes of the sambhogakāya and dharmakāya. There are five certainties with respect to sambhogakāya: place, teacher, retinue, teaching, and time. The place is Akaniṣṭha Gandavyuha (only accessible to bodhisattvas on the pure stages). The teacher is always Vairocana. The teaching is always Mahāyāna. The retinue is always bodhisattvas on the pure stages. The time is always. The nirmanakāyas on the other hand does not possess these five certainties. However, in order to generate faith, the 15th chapter of the Lotus deliberately ascribes qualities, a lifespan, and the five certainties to the nirmanakāya normally reserved for the dharmakāya and sambhogakāya.

It is also important to understand the dharmakāya of the buddhas of the three times is single. It is the same realization. It is never a different realization. The buddhas have one transcendent state. It does not matter if you call a buddha Samantabhadra, Vajradhara, Vajrayogini, Mañjuśrī, Vairocana, Vipassi, Śākyamuni, etc. They all have the same mind. The dharmakāya is single. Therefore, there is only one Teacher, no matter how many manifestations of that teacher appear. This is the actual profound point the Lotus Sūtra is making with respect to the person of the Buddha. There is a manifestation of the Teacher's nirmanakāya beyond all limitations for each and every sentient being.

When this chapter is read with reference to the wider context of general Mahāyāna doxography, it becomes quite clear what the intent is. The intent is to make people understand that the three kāyas are inseparable. Wherever there is a nirmanakāya, that nirmanakāya possesses also the other two kāyas, and vice versa.

If on the other hand you begin to claim as some do that only Śākyamuni is the real buddha, etc., then you slip into the deviation of condemning the Dharma and slandering the Buddha.

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddha states in the Mahāparibanna sutta that there is no actual limit to his lifespan. In that Hinayāna scripture, he demonstrates parnirvana only due to Ānanda's delinquency in asking him not to pass into nirvana. Indeed, this is why, in the seven limb prayer we ask the Buddhas not to remain in a state of nirvana. It is a common assumption in Mahāyāna in general that on attaining Buddhahood, the one attaining buddhahood now is completely free to manifest nirmanakāyas in a potentially unlimited number of worlds for as long as samsara exists.

Coëmgenu said:
The theorized original Prakrit Lotus Sutra is so far lost that I am almost sure that very few Buddhists we could easily name ever read any edition of the Lotus Sutra that was not primarily in Chinese. The Prakrit-Sanskrit originals have been completely lost as far as I know. The contemporary Sanskrit versions available are from a much later recension, as far as I know. "Primordial" however is an Englishism. "Source Buddha" or "Root Buddha" are better translations I think, but what do I know?

Malcolm wrote:
Nāgārjuna? Vasubandhu? Asanga? I can give you a list of Indian Panditas as long as your arm.

The contemporary Sanskrit edition is indeed later than the recension the Tibetan translation is based upon. But there are no serious differences between the recension the Tibetan translation is based upon and the recension that Kumarajiva used. It goes without saying that the Tibetan translation is more accurate than the Chinese translation, of any period.

[/quote] Well I don't even necessarily believe that either, but it is a valid reading of what the text literally says, and for many Buddhists, nothing around the Chapter 15-17 mark of the Lotus Sutra is at all provisional.[/quote]

The point of chapter fifteen is to explain why, among other things, the Buddha manifested nirvana when in fact he had no need to:

If it is asked why  show nirvana without going to nirvana, 
if I was always to be seen,
the ignorant who do not understand would become lazy.
And as for the lifespan issue, Pṛthivībandhu explains:
The lifespan with which nirmanakāya of the Tathāgata is endowed is an expedient explanation so that sentient being will generate devotion to [the Tathāgata] because the qualities and lifespan of the dharmakāya and sambhogakāya is incalculable

a time when there will not exist a Buddha cannot be said to exist any amount of time in the future.

That does not necessarily mean that the Buddha was ever not Awakened.

Malcolm wrote:
Primodial Buddhahood of this kind is rejected as irrational by Indian masters. Any assertion that there can be a primordial Buddha in the sense you mention above is "heretical," outside the pale of Dharma.

It is well understood that Śākyamuni is a nirmanakāya, i.e., an emanation of the sambhogakāya Vairocana, who in turn is the emanation of the dharmakāya, sometimes referred to in Yoga tantra and so as as Samantabhadra. This means that the Buddha's 12 acts were merely a play. But it does not mean that there wasn't a continuum at some point that realized the nature of reality and attained the dharmakāya level of realization, manifesting in myriad ways to benefit sentient beings according to the latter's inclinations.

However, just as there is no beginning of samsara, there was never a time when there were no buddhas guiding sentient beings.

But when we speak of buddhas living outside, in the world, etc., this is a very external view. It had nothing to do with how the three kāyas relate to ourselves and our own nature. The latter is far more important than provisional buddhological  cosmologies.

So the Lotus Sutra does still use the language of "attaining Buddhahood", which could be interpreted as to say that there exists a "beginning" to Buddhahood, that there existed a time when a being conventionally called Śākyamuni was not Buddha, but the wording of this sutra establishes the beginning of the Buddha's Buddhahood as without measure or limit.

Or, if you prefer, the āgama-parallel is more ambiguous: I have heard thus: Once, the Buddha travelled to Śrāvastī and stayed at Anāthapiṇḍada’s Park in Jeta’s Grove.

At that time, the World Honored One addressed the bhikṣus: “That the craving for existence is the ultimate origin for it is unknowable. Or is there no craving for existence at the origin? But, there does presently arise this craving for existence.

This is intended to exist on a major city in my country -about ten years from now- as a building where people can enter -inside-, but due that i don't know if there are specific instructions from Guru Padmasambhava or Buddha Sakyamunni or Mahasiddhas, i'm requesting such important information.

Also would like to say that this proyect is not intended as a lineage or school phiosophy form-like stupa, in this sense original -old like- information is very appreciated.

In Dzogchen - is Samantabadra Adi-Buddha?

If so, then

How does Samantabadra relate to Manjusri in terms of AdiBuddha?

Malcolm wrote:
Mañjuśrī, Samantabhadra, Vajrasattva, Vairocana, cittavajra, tathāgatagarbha, prajñāpāramitā, mind-essence, ordinary mind, luminosity, emptiness, pristine consciousness, bodhicitta, etc., are all just synonyms for the same thing: one's own unfabricated mind. As Ju Mipham states:
That luminosity of the primordial original basis, the original reality, is the ultimate dharmatā of all phenomena. All appearances of samsara and nirvana arise from that state. As soon as they arise, [3/b] it is impossible that there is a single phenomena other than abiding in that state. Since this is the ultimate ground of liberation, this is called “the dharmakāya of ultimate reality.” When the ultimate obscuration along with temporary traces are purified, the truth of cessation of the supreme vehicle is called “the svabhāvakāya that possesses the two ultimate purities.” That basis in which there is neither delusion nor liberation is the totally uniform nature.
The Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra states:

Everything is gathered into the essential state of Mañjuśrī, 
the pristine consciousness of all Secret Mantra,
the measure of the unerring transcendent state.
Therefore I am called the jñānasattva. 
Everything is part of the family
of Mañjuśrī no matter where it is, 
utterly pure, issuing from my state. 
I am the Bhagavan victor
But as Norbu Rinpoche said again today, belief is useless because you can believe or have faith in anything. Only direct experience is useful, because then a) you will not need to believe anything and b) you will have no doubt.

Malcolm wrote:
No, there is no reading between the lines in this.

The term ādibuddha canonically arrived with the Mañjuśrī-jñānasattvasya-paramārtha-nāma-saṃgīti, where the term adibuddha is used as a name for Mañjuśrī by Śākyamuni Buddha:
The adibuddha lacks a cause.
Garab Dorje define the phrase as follows:
"The adibuddha lacks a cause" means self-originated pristine consciousness
"Self-originated" here means something discovered within oneself, not something that was shown to one from outside.

Mañjuśrimitra explains the line as follows:
[Mañjuśrī] is the adibuddha because his identity from the first is dharmatā.
Vimalamitra explains the line in a more general sense, based on the passage that precedes:
If is asked how it is free from cause and condition,
since there is no beginning and end in buddhahood, 
the activity of the Buddhas of the three times,
the adibuddha lacks a cause—
the single eye of pristine consciousness is untainted.
He comments:
The activity of the buddhas of the buddhas of the three times is guiding sentient beings, but since there is no source for buddhahood in the beginning, nor a place to go in the end, it has no first cause.  Since the taints of dualistic grasping are absent in it, the eye of pristine consciousness is single.
Thus, in the text spoken by the Buddha, adibuddha refers not to a person, but rather to a principle.

The instance on the part of Nicherin Buddhists on Śākyamuni Buddha as "the adibuddha" misses the mark, in my opinion.

There are an 32 different writing on various aspects of this text attributed to Mañjuśrimitra alone out of a total of 79. It is probably the most commented upon tantra.

"Primordial Buddha" is a concept that is emphasized in different ways across Mahayana traditions.  It would be useful to put this concept in the context of Mahayana thought generally, and its various permutations.  It would also be useful to identify differing understandings or definitions of this concept, and instances in which this concept is not upheld at all.

Any takers?

Any sūtrānta that explains a self, a sentient being, a living being, a human being, a person, a man, human, a creator, a feeler in so many words, which shows that which lacks a self to be a self, those sūtrāntas are called "the provisional meaning." 

Any sūtrānta that explains emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, nonformation, nonarising, nonproduction, nonexistence, nonself, no sentient being, no living being, no person, no lord, and shows the gates of liberation, those sūtrāntas are called "the definitive meaning."

Uncompromisingly recognizing buddhahood in ourselves and all other beings and conducting ourselves accordingly is met with antagonism in this world. Enduring that antagonism, even at the cost of one's life, is the practice that immediately expiates karma. It is such a powerful practice that it overwhelms everything else, like a giant wave overwhelming ripples on the surface. This is exemplified by Sadaparibhuta (Never Disparaging). Nichiren practiced this.

There are much easier ways to eliminate all karma of taking rebirth in the six realms than experiencing intense austerity and suffering from antagonism.

Thanks for the info about the differences between lama chopa and lama tsongkhapa guru yoga. As an isolated practitioner I have been reciting the former at home but didn't realise it required HYT empowerment. Which I have not received by the way.  Sorry for my ignorance.
Also, who are we supposed to visualise in this sadhana? Who is the root guru? Who is 'my guru'? Are they both the same eg is one HH Dalai Lama and one the main teacher of the particular group I sometimes visit? Is it Buddha Shakyamuni, an archetype, or is it both mixed with Tsongkhapa? I am really confused.

This thread complements Pork Chop's thread on Kamakura Buddhism.

Yes, those texts are considered authentic. Some survive in his own hand.

You have to understand Nichiren's teaching to understand why he said these things. And he was vocal and untiring in his assertions.

His teachings are based on the Lotus Sutra and the Tiantai-Tendai teachings.

1. Nichiren asserted that a direct connection to the Buddha's enlightenment is the only real path to Buddhahood. Everything else, all upaya, if taken as a final path, is just a painful austerity.

2. The moment you hear the Buddha's name, ie. you are introduced to the real nature of the Buddha, whether you understand it or not, you are unalterably on the path to enlightenment. As the Avatamsaka Sutra explains, entering the path is fundamentally not different than achieving the goal. In the Tiantai-Tendai-Nichiren view, the Buddha is revealed in full, without expedients, only in the Lotus Sutra. Hence, the Lotus Sutra is the profoundest teaching. Everything else in comparison is upaya and coarse/unrefined/provisional.

3. For Nichiren, the field of endeavor of the Buddhist path is the saha world. Escape from the Saha world for Nichiren is a Phantom City. This is where the endeavor for Buddhahood plays out. This is the swamp from which the Lotus sprouts. Buddhahood is attained now,  in this body.

Nichiren's teaching is radically oriented to this moment. At the same time, understood through ichinen sanzen, this moment is the apex of the cosmos - the profoundest moment where enlightenment is achieved. Practice undertaken now in this moment is the awakening of enlightenment. This moment is THE crucial moment.

Any teaching that does not directly teach this immediate path is an upaya that is to be discarded in light of this teaching (its a little more refined than that - the revelation of the immediate path is said to transform expedients into the immediate path - opening the provisional to reveal the real). Teachers who obfuscate the immediacy of enlightenment lead people wrong, and are karmically culpable. Hence, the teachers he asserted fell into hell are in his view, people who who knew this immediate teaching but obfuscated the immediacy of enlightenment and caused people to waste this precious human life on fruitless austerities.

Malcolm wrote:
This is nonsense. For example, you have Sanders. One reason Sanders lost was because of his inability to understand racism was not a class issue, it was an identity issue. Why? Because among the working class, certain groups have always been isolated because of their identity. For example, Italian socialists returning from the US were upset with the German domination of Socialism in the US. This actually informed the rise of Fascism in Italy. African-Americans have been historically marginalized among so called "working class people" because of their race. Indeed, during the 18th century, laws were established in many southern colonies to advantage poor whites over blacks in order to prevent them from uniting against the wealthy in those colonies.

The best way to deny someone's civil rights is to claim their identity does not matter. For example, the campaign to legally eliminate American Indian Tribes in the late 19th century.

JD,
and how about the part where he talks about Majid and Ayan Hursi Ali being put on the SPLC's list? Unbelievable, right?
Born Ayaan Hirsi Magam, she migrated to the Netherlands in 1992, changed her name to Hirsi Ali, and lied to Dutch authorities about her past. Contrary to the story she told the government, she arrived in the Netherlands not from war-torn Somalia, but from Kenya, where she lived in a secure environment and under the protection of the United Nations, which funded her education at a well-regarded Muslim girls’ school. Though she told immigration authorities and the Dutch public she had fled from civil war in Somalia, she left that country before its war broke out. Indeed, she did not live through a war there or anywhere else. Thanks to her fabrications, Hirsi Ali received political asylum in just five weeks.

Hirsi Ali told astonished audiences on Dutch talk shows that her supposedly devout family had forced her to marry a draconian Muslim man, that she had not been present at her own wedding, and that her family had threatened to kill her for offending their religious honor. However, Zembla told a drastically different story. Hirsi Ali’s brother, aunt and former husband each testified that she had indeed been present at her wedding. It turned out that Hirsi Ali’s mother had sent her brother to a Christian school, not exactly an indication of Islamic fanaticism.

He claims that Dzogchen is not the teaching of Śākyamuni. Again false. Śākyamuni is one of the 12 Buddhas who taught Dzogchen either directly or indirectly.

It is also a fact that Dzogchen is highest teaching of the Buddha there is. Just read the Kulayarāja tantra.

Since this is so, passing over a white child for admission to school X will demonstrably affect that child less in comparison to the advantage conferred to the child of color in question. In other words, affirmative action measures are fair as long as there is no equitable federal standards and funding for public schools across all districts.

Not so. Schools may, if they choose, be boys only or girls only schools. That is a form of discrimination. Is it necessarily a bad thing?

Freedom from discrimination is not, inherently, a right. In many cases, however, it is a privilege.
You are conflating discrimination in its primary sense with discrimination in its secondary sense. Freedom from discrimination (in its primary sense) is an inalienable right. Sending boys and girls to gendered schools is not necessarily discriminatory in the primary sense— though it could be, if like my mother, as part of that education one was forced to learn how to peal peaches with white gloves on since no boys were ever expected to learn such a useless skill.

Hello Sangha,

I'm relatively new to Dzogchen so please pardon any ignorant questions on my part. I'm trying to tread as carefully and responsibly as possible here, I'm aware of the immense power.

I'm a musician who's recently received pointing out instructions, I'm interested in writing songs about my experience.

Can anyone definitely say what I should steer clear of and what is fair game in terms of writing about Dzogchen and my experience? I'm interested in different opinions.

Different but related question, as someone who meets and performs in front of crowds, exposing many people to dzogchen seems in line with the bodhisattva vows. Am I off base here? Yeah, Nay? How should I go about it if so?

Thank you,

Max,

You should not write of your experience. Nor should you write anything about Dzogchen.

For instance, if I have children, I would prefer them, and them alone (with my wife if I have one), to have the privilege of living in my house, and benefiting, as much as is possible, from my guidance and teaching. Preferably, I would home school my children. This is conferring a true a privilege, and I do not think there is any negative value that one can give to it. No other person off the street is entitled to that in the same way. Owning any private property, also, is a privilege.

Rational analysis can only address rational objects. We can prove, rationally, that there is not, has not been, and could never be any inherently existing thing. That does not posit non-existence as the nature of ultimate truth; it simply points out that inherency is no truth at all, neither relative nor ultimate, and takes it out of the equation.

This formulation of the arising of suffering has puzzled me for a long time. It differs from the more common teaching on the 12 Linked Chain in that consciousness does not have its base in "constructing activities" which in turn has its base in ignorance. Rather, consciousness and name-and-form are proposed as mutually dependent and arising. Name-and-form is a function of consciousness and consciousness is a function of name-and-form. This is not quite a materialist view, but seems closer to it than the picture given by the 12 Linked Chain.

Etienne Lamotte has pointed out that there are variations in the teaching of  dependent rising in the Pitakas.
In the formulation of Nagara sutta "consciousness" stands for the first three links of the more common formulation. The first three links  are consciousness.
The standard formulation of 12 links is true as it is in the explanation of one life only. There is no need to take away ignorance and karmic formations to make it apply to this life only.

Kenneth Chan said:
Malcolm, you are now saying basically the same thing that Lama Tsongkhapa has been saying all along, only with different terminology. Saying that there is “no outright negation” of karma, samsara, and so on, is essentially the same as saying that there is the “mere existence” of conventional appearances and functionality.

Malcolm wrote:
Not at all. In classical Madhamaka appearances are investigated directly, but not in Tsongkhapa's revisionist approach.


Kenneth Chan said:
Saying that they are “completely unreal, products of delusion, etc.” is essentially the same as saying that “nothing exists from its own side, not even a tiny bit.” You have been merely arguing over semantics all this while, and that is what I have been trying to point out all this while.

Malcolm wrote:
Again, not at all.


Kenneth Chan said:
No one is “more and more strongly reinforcing” conventional appearance and functionality. I have repeatedly made this point that there is no “affirmation of existence” (as you put it) in Lama Tsongkhapa’s meaning. So please do not keep insisting on this misinterpretion. If "nothing exists from its own side, not even a tiny bit," in terms of ontology, what else is left to be negated?

I know this. But the question still remains: Is the purpose of Madhyamaka to enable us to control the elements? It would appear that this is not the case, because Milarepa still had to undergo a difficult spiritual journey with Marpa. In fact, Milarepa's ability to control the elements actually hindered him here, because his actions in conjuring up hailstones ended up creating negative karma. Is that not so?[/quote]

The point is that karmic appearance such as the elements are a limitation to be overcome, not a convention to be more and more strongly reinforced.

In another thread about a presentation of a 10 linked chain of causation in the Tipitaka (SN 12:65 and DN 14), Malcolm raised a point about ignorance in the 12 linked chain of causation being different than ignorance as the lack of knowledge about the selflessness of dharmas. MKoll brought up the definition of ignorance in the Pali Sutta as being ignorance of the Four Noble Truths.

This brought me to a fundamental question. A very brief search of this forum did not turn up any recent discussions on the topic, so, I'm starting a new thread.

What is the technical meaning of ignorance (avidya) in Mahayana Buddhism?

Malcolm wrote:
There are two, ignorance that is a knowledge obscuration, discussed by Vasubandhu in the opening the Kośa as the nonafflictive ignorance of Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas, and the ignorance that is the first link (but not the first cause) in the twelve nidanas, which is afflictive ignorance that arises from not knowing causes and results.

Something that I haven't seen talked about on here are the terms we seem to have accepted as standard jargon for Buddhism in English.

Sanskrit bodhi (Tibetan byang chub ) is most often translated as "enlightened," but does that accurately convey the meaning of the term in either of the canonical languages?  I've heard it said that this is a poor translation, and that the connotation we have for enlightenment in English is absent.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct. It is an incorrect translation of bodhi, which means "to awaken."

Karma Jinpa said:
But how does moksha ( thar pa ) compare to bodhi ( byang chub )?  For that matter, where does the Tibetan verb sgrol ba come in?  Drölma ( sgrol ma ) is "She who Liberates," so how does sgrol relate to thar?  Are there subtle differences in subtext/connotation?


Malcolm wrote:
There is a small difference between thar pa and grol ba; the former translates mokṣa, the latter mukti, so both may be translated as liberation. Sgrol ba however translates tāraka, meaning to free or to save.

Karma Jinpa said:
Sometimes bodhi is translated to English as "awakening," which seems more in tune with the Buddha being "the Awakened One," a reference to the dream-like illusory nature of Samsara and having woken from said dream, seeing things as they actually are.  Is "awakening" a superior translation that should supercede "enlightenment"?  Is there another term not considered here which would more accurately portray the words in Sanskrit/Tibetan?  Or should we stick to "enlightenment," and if so, why?

“Understanding conventional truth enables the practitioner to develop the method side—compassion, concentration, and ethics—whereas understanding the ultimate truth leads to the wisdom side—emptiness. These realizations will, in turn, result in the two Buddha bodies, the truth body and the form body.”

If the realization of the rainbow body has really to do with the level of realization, involving the union of method and wisdom, this means that it is more a case of the highly advanced mind being able to influence the way conventional appearances manifest (and not the case of what you consider a difference in the “level of negation” in the understanding of emptiness) that counts.

Malcolm wrote:
The first paragraph is definitely Gelug orthodoxy.

In the second case, you cannot influence the way others see you. If you realize rainbow body in this life, called the great transference body, people will see you as ordinary if they are ordinary.

Isn't a realisation of the nature of the mind the same in both respects?

Higher in terms of omniscience and realization.

But if what you want to is boil water in it, then it's lack of ultimate own-being is  neither here nor there.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, and this is why refuting only inherent existence rather that all four extremes misses the mark.

Someone who has realized emptiness does not need a pot to boil water.

But the idea that inherent existence is all we need to negate makes emptiness more comfortable for modern people who at base do not wish to abandon their realism.

As long as someone thinks that the appearance of pots withstand analysis, for that long they will never even have a chance of realizing rainbow body.

Hi,

I am just teading Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang Rinpoches book 'The Practice Of Mahamudra'

On page 29 he suggests that the end result is the same whether we practice Tantric or Sutra Mahamudra. The latter being Samatha and Vipassana.

Does this mean that Theravadins acheive Mahamudra too by practicing Vipassana and Samatha?

Malcolm wrote:
No, there is the small matter of the view and motivation.

Also it is not certain that the result of sūtra and tantra are the same. There are many assertions in the tantra that the result of practicing Vajrayāna is higher.

"  Those lacking that authentic approach, the 'Dharma practitioners' of the degenerate times, do not engage in proper view and conduct.  With no time to listen, they long to meditate.  With no time to meditate, they long to explain. Not matured themselves, they long to empower others.  Not free themselves, they teach experiential guidance to others. Those with no meditation do fake meditation. Those with no realization offer fake realization.  Those with no freedom offer fake freedom. Those with no experience make a lot of noise about emptiness.  Their outer appearance is of venerable scholars, proclaiming themselves.  Doing their recitations, they portray a false image of erudition.  Those with no qualities label the faults of others.  What are their names? Choje, Rinpoche, Tokden, Siddha, Loppon, Khenpo, Gomchen, Yogin, Monk, Geshe, and Sangha.  They are labeled with these pure names, these Dharma practitioners, dressed up in fancy red cloth and silk.  Many a one has been seen here in Tibet.

" Generally, in this bad, degenerate time, the signs that evil blessings have struck will be that a charlatan is preferred to a fine individual and that a gift of a morsel of tasty food is preferred to heartfelt explanation of instructions.  Without realization in subjective meditational experience, practitioners will look to assemble the conducive external conditions.  Since there are so many kinds of savages and criminals, no one will be able to be a great mediator in the mountains, so in general those great meditators will have no realization.  The monks will have no discipline, the realized ones no sacred pledge, and the mantra adepts no powers.  Disciples of bold lamas will gather around to sell their own fame.  Girls without vows will secretly sleep with the clergy.  Delinquent boys will sleep in secret with nuns.  The crevices in the walls of monasteries will be full of the corpses of the clergy's illegitimate infant boys and girls.

"  They will say they are practising Secret Mantra but will have no quality of the path of means.  They will say they have discipline but will keep no vows.  The profound esoteric instructions will be sold for wealth.  Diligence will all go to creating curses and adversity.  Dharma language will be broadcast by lay people, and in the philosophical language of emptiness, all women will be esteemed.  Keeping their teacher secret, disciples will broadcast their own greatness.  Many will be those who desire Dharma, but few who desire a lama.  The fortunate noble person whose karma from previous training has awakened, just the few who have not regressed before the end of their aspirations, the few who truly practice the Dharma, will be scattered outside of Tibet and few will remain."

I would think it would be safe to say that the eyes perceive things as they are, in exactly the moment that the light rebounding off (or emitted from) the object reaches them.  The speed of light is such that it would be a more or less instantaneous (unless the light was coming from an object a crazily large distance away, but still, the eyes would receive an impression of the visual object as it looks at that moment to us here and now).  The process of seeing occurs after that.  The mind process of seeing is pretty bloody fast too, though.  But what we see (at the end of the entire process) is actually something that no longer exists.  A thing of the past.

Perception also includes interpretation, and this addition to / projection onto the object is normally based on past experiences so, effectively, at the end of the entire process, perception is essentially of the past.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, this is why mind (manas) is understood to be in the past. We cannot "be here now" or "be in the present moment" no matter how much we want to unless we are resting in a state free of concepts.

That's what I said. However, they pointed out that 1) "inherent existence" was a mental projection, and removing this projection revealed appearances to be empty; and 2) that reasoning can only refute mental projections, and not appearances as such.

you know what? i once asked Namkhai Norbu -a Buddha- this question: "is the rainbowbody like reflations in a mirror?", and he said "yes, even the rainbowbody is like reflations in a mirror". what this means? it means that at last there is no limitation, we can rebirth, we can go to a pure land, we can manifest as a rigdzin, we can manifest as a boddhisattva, we can reside in a statue, we can stay in the rainbowbody, ..., we have an infinite amount of possibilities and everything will be "like reflations in a mirror" if we understand what it really means and "total realize ourselves".

people tend to think that nirvana, or the rainbowbody, and so, is like anoter thing of different nature like from another planet -don't laugh-. but nature of samsara and realization is not different for the nature of mind is exactly the same all the time.

i won't try to convince anybody, because this is a elucidation from a question and it's answer, and language can be very tricky and i could be in a wrong understanding also, only proof can confirm, but to me everything points in that direction.

HH Dalai Lama said:
So how can we develop a personal understanding of the fundamental Buddhist doctrine of the Two Truths? By coming to know our everyday world of lived experience, we appreciate what is known as samvrti satya, the world of conventional reality, where the causal principle operates. If we accept the reality of this world as conventional, then we can accept the empty nature of this world which, according to Buddhism, is the ultimate truth, the paramartha satya. The realationship between these two aspects of reality is important. The world of appearance is used not so much as a contrast or an opposite to the world of ultimate truth, but rather as the evidence, the very basis on which the ultimate nature of reality is established.
