I'm not so sure about the concept of the sacred simply because, at least as I've been taught, everything without exception and everyone has sacred qualities--and if everything is sacred, then nothing isn't sacred, and the concept has no real meaning anymore.

dzogchungpa said:
Well, maybe. I think there is definitely a sense in Buddhism that things like stupas, relics, temples, certain people and places, images of Buddhas etc. are "special" in some positive way.

FWIW, CTR used the word 'sacred' quite a lot, and in particular translated "dag snang" as "sacred outlook", see e.g. "The Tantric Path of Indestructible Wakefulness".


Malcolm wrote:
With regard to your last comment, "sacred outlook" does not work for dag snang. You do not need to consecrate anything to have dag snang. Dag snang is self-arising. You cannot fabricate dag snang.

Stupas, relics, temples, are sacred precisely because they are "set apart," nevertheless, there still is no Buddhist word of which I am aware that maps to "sacred".

OED:
sacred |ˈsākrid|
adjective
connected with God (or the gods) or dedicated to a religious purpose and so deserving veneration: sacred rites | the site at Eleusis is sacred to Demeter.
• religious rather than secular: sacred music.
• (of writing or text) embodying the laws or doctrines of a religion: a sacred Hindu text.
• regarded with great respect and reverence by a particular religion, group, or individual: an animal sacred to Mexican culture.
• sacrosanct: to a police officer nothing is sacred.
The nearest Tibetan word that overlaps might be " lha " in some of its uses, like " lha chos ", for example.

Some posters have recently, on other threads, expressed the opinion  that ethics and morality can exist without religion, and it seems a case made be made for this proposition. I would say that Kim is right, however, to point out that an ethical code based on an incomplete understanding of reality is still better than no ethical code at all.

Malcolm wrote:
Most secular people are of the opinion that a) reality is not completely understood, and b) religions [including Buddhism] are based on a far less complete understanding of reality than the present level of scientific knowledge.

Despite the fact that United States was founded on the ethnic cleansing of entire nations from their lands, which all Americans need to learn about, an important concept enshrined in the US Constitution is the Establishment Clause, which mandates what is popularly termed "the separation of church and state."

Because this is such an important principle in modern civilization, we have no choice but to continue to forge and strengthen a liberal ethical consensus apart from our individual religious convictions.


tingdzin said:
To shift the focus, though, I myself am of the opinion that when  religion is lost, humanity also loses a sense of the sacred.

Malcolm wrote:
I don't agree with this at all. Religions tend to make "the sacred" beyond the reach of common people, creating celestial hierarchies that do little more than mirror the social divisions of the peoples they pretend to serve.

tingdzin said:
What does "sacred" mean to you?

Malcolm wrote:
It is not really a Buddhist word — I can't think of a single Buddhist term in either Sanskrit or Tibetan that truly maps to this term in the way it is used in English.

We can go back its root, consecrate, which really means to set something apart. We also have the word "holy" which ultimately derives from the word *kailo — whole, uninjured, of good omen.

Tsongkhapafan, I think it's interesting that some here claim things like, "Buddhism isn't and evangelical religion" despite the fact that Buddhism is well know for being the first evangelical religion in recorded history. The Buddha said:

Go forth for the good of the many, for the happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare, the good and the happiness of gods and men. Let no two of you go in the same direction. Teach the Dharma which is beautiful in the beginning, beautiful in the middle and beautiful at the end. Proclaim both the letter and the spirit of the holy life completely fulfilled and perfectly pure.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course the Buddha wanted the Dharma to spread, but he did not want people to be zealots, which is what "evangelical" means outside of its specifically Christian meaning.

This is why there were strict rules laid down in the beginning about who could teach, who could be taught, when and where there could be teaching, and so on.

Evangelists don't care about context and decorum in their zeal to spread "the good news" and create converts.

It never suggests to people who are following other paths that they need to change, etc. If someone is interested in Buddhadharma, great.

You have to give people methods for practising ethics, you can't just tell them to 'be good' because without a method for being a good person, you will try, fail and feel guilty. This is many religious practitioners' experience if they don't have a path. Secular ethics is not a path because, being devoid of religion, it's just telling people to be good. It doesn't work. Ethics devoid of meditation doesn't work.

Malcolm wrote:
Secular ethics is not a path in the Buddhist sense, certainly.

Apparently you have never heard of Confucianism, a perfectly lovely example of secular ethics where ethical conduct is engaged in purely because it results in social harmony.  It is however a means of ensuring social good and harmony, and those are themselves worthy ends in their own right.


Tsongkhapafan said:
Sure, of course not all people have the propensity to practise Dharma, but many do, many more than at present have access to it and therefore it would seem to be a good idea to create the conditions for them to be able to do so.

Malcolm wrote:
I though you understood the principles of karma. In any case, your original claim that His Holiness does not stress Buddhism is really complete and total nonsense. But by the same token, he is a political liberal, and understands the need for forging consensus and tolerance across religious lines — that cannot happen if he is constantly encouraging people to abandon their traditions for a new one. He is not an evangelist, unlike the Popes. That is not his job, and that has never been the job of Buddhist leaders.


Tsongkhapafan said:
Humanism talks about it which is great but doesn't give people the methods to develop anything - without a path, without methods, there's no chance of success.

Malcolm wrote:
One does not need a method to develop love and compassion other than recognizing suffering and having the desire to do something to alleviate it as much as possible. Quite honestly, I know a lot of religious people who don't do shit to help others, Buddhists included, who spend all their time arguing about religion and praying rather than getting off their assess and helping others. I know a lot of completely non-religious people who devote their lives to helping others, and frankly, I know more of the latter who are actively engaged in helping others than the former.

[qupte]
Those people who already have highly developed love and compassion have so because they met a spiritual path in the past and were able to practise moral discipline and meditations to improve their love and compassion. If there is no method there is no practice and no success. Just telling people to be good doesn't work.[/quote]

From the point of view of the narrative we follow, this makes sense. But it does not make sense to people who have not drunk the Buddhist koolaid and there is no good reason on earth that we should try and force people to accept our views. Instead we should encourage people, without reference to religion, to be good, ethical people as ends in themselves because this leads to a harmonious society.

Astus said:
So, there is a gradual path for those who have not yet attained understanding. And once there is understanding, one should still follow through tregcho and thogal practices, so again, it seems gradual.

Malcolm wrote:
Dzogchen is not a "path" in the sense that one goes from here to there, as alpha pointed out to you. There is no path like "first train in śamatha, then train in vipaśyāna; first train on path of accumulation, then application, then seeing, etc., first do creation, then do completion," etc.

Tregchö and thogal are not "practices" in the sense that one is making effort to generate a result from some cause. Tregchö and thögal are how one continues in the confidence of liberation, or as CHNN parses it, how one continues in the state.

Unknown said:
The long and short of it is that Dzogchen teachings did not fit in the mold of gradual and sudden dichotomy [which is a conversation is only tangentially relevant to Dzogchen due to the conflict in Tibet over Indian and Chinese approaches to Mahāyāna sūtra]. They also do not fit into the mold of ultimate and relative truths. They do not fit into the mold of paths and stages.

Malcolm wrote:
Sudden means direct access to the ultimate. If there are stages involved in the path, it is necessarily gradual. So, if Dzogchen were just recognising the primordial state, then it would be a sudden method. If preliminaries and follow up practices are also included, it is gradual.
"Ultimate and relative" have no meaning in Dzogchen. Dzogchen is not "a method of directly accessing the ultimate," if it were, it would be Chan. Because this is so, Dzogchen is not a "sudden" system. One does not need to have realized emptiness in order to have knowledge [ rig pa ] of their primordial state [ thog ma'i gzhi, a.k.a. original basis]. There is no need to gather accumulations and so on.

To the extent that there are stages in Dzogchen, there is only one stage and everyone is already on it. The Rig pa rang shar tantra likens it to being on a lake. No matter where you go on a lake, you never leave the lake.

News flash! Not everyone has the propensity to practice Dharma. In fact, a very tiny minority of sentient beings have the propensity to practice Dharma. This is what it means to have a precious human birth with the eight freedoms and ten endowments.

Tsongkhapafan said:

Humanism isn't going to lead to Dharma, and neither is politics or social change movements. The world needs a genuine spiritual path not secular ethics that implicitly deny the value of religion.

Malcolm wrote:
Sure it will. Humanism encourages people to develop compassion and love for others, and encourages them to avoid non-virtues of body, voice and mind. This will cause them to accumulate merit and continue to take rebirth in higher realms. This is precisely the vehicle of gods and men that the Buddha taught, for example, in the famed Kalamas Sutta.

As I said, not exactly.

The aggregates are a product of mind, correct? Mind is deluded correct? What a deluded mind perceives is a delusion, correct?

Ye shes is a product of rig pa, correct? Rig pa is undeluded, correct? What undeluded rig pa perceives is not a delusion, correct?

As the Pellucid Transcendent State[/i [dgongs pa zang thal] tells us, there is one basis, two paths, and two results. At the end of one of those paths lies the five aggregates and samsara; and at the end of the other path is the five wisdoms and nirvana.

However, there is a way in which phenomena of samsara and the phenomena of nirvana are the same, as Mañjuśrīmitra declares:
Therefore, because awakening and nonawakening are the same in terms of absence of characteristics, there is nothing to accept or reject.
So therefore:
[It is the Dharma] in which one abides in sameness, like the supreme lotus of the world, not avoiding anything.
And:
Abide in sameness without imputing duality, free from speech, nothing to do or to not do, nothing to accumulate or reduce.
And of course, it goes without saying we need to be careful about being arrogant about what we think we understand. As Mañjuśrimitra states:
The pride of promoting one’s understanding and lording it over all,
giving rise to attachment and aversion, is ignorance which does not see the meaning, producing conflict.
Mipham futher clarifies this:
If one engages in grasping such as, “Freedom from all views is seeing the ultimate meaning,” promoting the idea, “My understanding is the realization of the truth” and lording it over all, the pride caused by that view, causing attachment to one’s own views and aversion towards views of others, is ignorance which produces conflicts. Since there is no so-called “truth” or “falsity”, holding onto one’s view as true and holding onto the views of others as false are thoughts that does not correspond to the way both exist. Therefore, the authentic meaning of not perceiving either true nor false is not seen.

Sila is something a Buddhist undertakes as part of a practice aimed at personal transformation; it has no necessary bearing on the wider sociopolitcal sphere. The latter should be based on "a political conception the principles and values of which all citizens can endorse."

Yes.

Lazy_eye said:
That distinction seems to neatly untangle certain problems, such as how a Buddhist should approach contentious issues such as abortion. The answer would seem to be that a Buddhist should personally practice sila, which includes non-killing. But since there is no "overlapping consensus" about the morality of abortion, it would be inappropriate for a Buddhist to join up with pro-lifers, for instance; this would constitute an extension of religious doctrine into the civic sphere.

What would be the general outline of such a system?

Malcolm wrote:
There is a long discussion about this in the analytical philosophy tradition. Rawls in part answers your question:
The religious doctrines that in previous centuries were the professed basis of society have gradually given way to principles of constitutional government that all citizens, whatever their religious view, can endorse. Comprehensive philosophical and moral doctrines likewise cannot be endorsed by citizens generally, and they also no longer can, if they ever could, serve as the professed basis of society. Thus, political liberalism looks for a political conception of justice that we hope can gain the support of an overlapping consensus of reasonable religious, philosophical, and moral doctrines in a society regulated by it. Gaining this support of reasonable doctrines lays the basis for answering our second fundamental question as to how citizens, who remain deeply divided on religious, philosophical, and moral doctrines, can still maintain a just and stable democratic society. To this end, it is normally desirable that the comprehensive philosophical and moral views we are wont to use in debating fundamental political issues should give way in public life. Public reason—citizens’ reasoning in the public forum about constitutional essentials and basic questions of justice—is now best guided by a political conception the principles and values of which all citizens can endorse (VI). That political conception is to be, so to speak, political and not metaphysical.

Political liberalism, then, aims for a political conception of justice as a freestanding view. It offers no specific metaphysical or epistemological doctrine beyond what is implied by the political conception itself. As an account of political values, a free-standing political conception does not deny there being other values that apply, say, to the personal, the familial, and the associational; nor does it say that political values are separate from, or discontinuous with, other values. One aim, as I have said, is to specify the political domain and its conception of justice in such a way that its institutions can gain the support of an overlapping consensus. In this case, citizens themselves, within the exercise of their liberty of thought and conscience, and looking to their comprehensive doctrines, view the political conception as derived from, or congruent with, or at least not in conflict with, their other values.

You may not approve of the wars which are fought, freeing you from the karmic burden of them; you may not approve of a market selling meat, freeing you from that that burden of karma. I also do not approve of killing and slaughter, but I also know that my eating meat bought at whole foods, for example, has nothing to do with the act of ordering an animal killed, etc. It would be different of course if I ordered a side of beef from a local rancher. But I don't.

If our culture changes so that no one buys meat, I won't buy it or eat it since it won't be available any longer.  But all the evidence suggests that animals will be slaughtered for meat long after we are gone, and in the mean time, since there is no fault with eating meat that is pure in three ways, I will continue to do so when I need to, since I have found that I actually need to eat some amount of meat, to maintain my health.

The basis is called “great original purity” which is present as the essence, nature and compassion. The pristine consciousness of the unchanging essence manifests without impediment and is called “the reality of the youthful vase body.” The nature is the unimpeded five lights. For example, the appearance of compassion is like the absence of clouds. That is called “the reality of original purity,” i.e. unlimited and not falling into any position
And:
One will be liberated on the ultimate stage of original purity.
And:
Next, the absence of anything higher than the pristine consciousness
that naturally arises on the stage of original purity is the
attainment of the sixteen stage, Highest Wisdom.
And the String of Pearls Tantra states:
Everything actualizes buddhahood in the state
of original purity free from taints.
The Realms and Transformations of Sound Tantra states:
Further, when the mind is ripened,
the basis is present in the dharmakāya,
the taints upon original purity are exhausted
and the essence has never been deluded.
Vimalamitra states:
The basis, the state of initial original purity, is liberated
because its essence is not established at all.
Its nature appears as everything
and its compassion arises in every way.
It is pretty clear to me that the intention of the 17 Tantras is that the basis is ka dag, original purity.

Vimalamitra comments on this passage:
When the asserted positions about the seven bases that are the object of knowledge are divided into two, there are six defective positions concerning the basis and the faultless position of original purity which is confirmed in our own texts...A follower of philosophical tenets asserts that all objects of knowledge are confirmed from the seven positions because assertions about the basis are confirmed through proofs, refutations, contradictions and replies. Those other six defective philosophical tenets are clearly explained in the Six Dimensions and so on. However, those who follow philosophical tenets [15a] resemble someone who has not seen Vajrāsana telling stories about Vajrāsana. Simply put, they do not confirm the profound meaning that is to be understood.
So however you want to slice it up, of the seven positions about the basis, only the position that the basis is originally pure is non-defective.

One the other hand what good does it do to make kadag the focus of one's view and place lhun grub on a lesser position as potentially being the cause of error.
To me focusing on kadag alone as being the definitive view can lead to errors as well.

Malcolm wrote:
Addressing your concern, he continues:
Since the six assertions about the basis are recognized as the potential of original purity, the practice of the faultless philosophical tenet is like explaining Vajrāsana having been there. That is without error. In addition, it is so because the explanatory description is faultless. People who follow philosophical tenets can only partially explain how the six assertions about the basis are defective.
In other words, it is recognized that the other six positions about the basis, while faulty, do indeed address an aspect of the potentiality of original purity. Nevertheless, only describing the basis as original purity is considered absolutely faultless from the point of view of the system of Dzogchen laid out in the 17 Tantras.

Maybe the problem here is that your understanding of original purity is too confined to the emptiness aspect. Original purity has essence, nature and compassion. It has the three kāyas. Why? Because it is dharmakāya. There is no dharmakāya without the other two.

Aye, that does seem to be the rub.

I understand that Tantra is also distinct from Dzogchen. Can you elaborate on that distinction?

Malcolm wrote:
Sūtra in general belongs to the path of renunciation — this is the main method of practice.

Tantra in general belongs to the path of transformation — using the creation stage and completion stage and so on, generating oneself as the deity, reciting mantras, transforming one's impure dimension into a pure one.

Dzogchen is path of liberation or self-liberation, where one does not need to apply any sort of antidote, either in terms of renunciation or transformation. Instead phenomena are allowed to self-liberate just a they are by recognizing one's primordial state and integrating with that. Apart from Norbu Rinpoche's teachings, the place where these three paths are most clearly explained is in the Zhang Zhung sNyan rgyud teachings belonging to the Bon school, especially the outer cycle:
Now then, the first, the path of renunciation, gives up the ten nonvirtues and accomplishes the ten virtues. The result is asserted to be buddhahood after many lives and eons. That is the path of causal characteristics. 

Second, the so called “path of transformation” of result secret mantra is transforming the outer universe into a celestial mansion, transforming the inhabitants into gods and goddesses, transforming the five samsaya substances into the five ambrosias, transforming the five aggregates into the five deities and transforming the five afflictions into the five wisdoms. This is asserted as buddhahood, being the path of result secret mantra. 

However, neither the path of renunciation nor the past of transformation will be explained here. What it to be explained here now is the inseparability of cause and result in the great vehicle. 

In the explanation of the so called “path of great self liberation with nothing to accept or reject” samsara and nirvana, existence and nonexistence, the duality of permanence and annihilation, the duality of happiness and suffering, the duality of attachment and aversion, the five afflictions, the eight consciousnesses, all appearances of deluded concepts of subject and object are not abandoned and are not to be abandoned. Since everything arises from the mind, in the sole unique sphere, abandonment and accepting do not exist as a duality. Therefore, everything that arises self-arises, everything that is liberated is self-liberated, therefore it is termed “the path of liberation.”

Malcolm wrote:
The reality of the original basis that exists permeated with the intrinsic nature of the three pristine consciousnesses, essence, nature and compassion, is the inwardly illuminated original purity.
It has lhun grub, but lhun grub is the cause of making mistakes, whereas, ka dag can never be the cause of error. This is why 17 Tantras state that the basis is ka dag, and that this is the correct position. Sometimes, the union of ka dag and lhun grub is called " ka dag chen po " — still, ka dag is more important because it can never be a basis for delusion, unlike lhun grub.

alpha said:
To me those quotes you gave are only arguments to support the originally pure nature of the basis .Because this purity is not just purity it has a potentiality and a luminosity, aspects which are actually reffered in your quotes essence, nature and compassion

Malcolm wrote:
They are taken directly from the book, Buddhahood in This Life [to be published by Wisdom next year], where the author, Vimalamitra, runs through the seven positions of the basis, and identifies the position of the basis as ka dag as the only faultless one. This is a summary of an extensive section in the commentary of the Kun bzang klong drug tantra. Vimalamitra does not go into it further because, as he says, it is mostly an intellectual discussion, not for practitioners.

Ka dag does not mean only emptiness, though sometimes people misunderstand it that way Ka dag refers to the fact that reality has always been pure, never affected by ignorance and so on. This is why it is the basis, and not lhun grub.

We make a distinction between the Primordial Buddha, which is the True Aspect of each being's Mind, and the Buddhas with 32 Major and 80 Minor characteristics who appear in response to the needs of deluded beings. The way we put it, we each embody all sentient as well as insentient beings such as plants, trees, rocks down to atoms and up to the entire dharmadhatu environment in a way that mind and body, self and environment, and person and reality are "two but not two". Our starting point is the Primordial Buddha's revelation of his body, which we do not presently understand completely, and then progression through investigation to full realization. Provisional Buddha (the Buddha that appears as Buddha) is the awakening function of our Mind.

Because there is no arising and perishing, there is no self and other. Because there is no death and transmigration, there is no permanence and annihilation.

Industrial meat cultivation is certainly bad for the environment.

But we humans put our welfare above that of other creatures, including other humans, all the time. It is the norm, not the exception. Every time we dig in the ground, "relocate" some "pest" we do not like in "our" house and so on, every time we decide to disturb some environment so we can exploit it. For example, we decide we need to irrigate a field —— we give absolutely no thought to the millions, possibly billions of creatures we are drowning. But vegetarians consider rice "less harmful."

The idea that being a vegetarian is less harmful than choosing to consume consciously raised, grass fed beef and pastured pork and chicken is ludicrous.

The fact is that everything we do harms some one or something. We have our vanity of course, but in the end, everyone chooses to ignore the harm they do to some creature either directly or indirectly. At least I don't pretend. I choose my diet based on what is good for the planet as a whole, understanding that all my choices involve harming some creature or another.

By all means spare a thought for the suffering of beings as small as a dust mite, but it seems to me completely impractical to avoid actions that may unintentionally harm them. Such actions of course include washing you own body and clothes. There is inevitably a kind of background noise of suffering we cause that we simply cannot avoid. Presented with this fact (and equating the suffering of microorganisms with that of more highly developed animals), some will rationalize that practicing harmlessness it futile, and disregard the tangible suffering inflicted on the animals that they choose to exploit. Worse still are the crude justifications made for overlooking this suffering. When these justifications are made in the name of the Buddhadharma, the truly compassionate must speak out.

Malcolm wrote:
When you know they are there, you are not "unintentionally" harming them, you are ignoring them.

For example, just as when one drives a car in the spring and summer, thousands of insects wind up smashed in the grill of our cars. We may regret all the thousands of insect lives we take, but we certainly do nothing about them. We keep driving anyway, since our human business is so much more important than theirs, and we are more "highly developed" sentient beings.

The thing is, there no qualitative difference between one creature and another, there is only quantitative difference in terms of sense organ development. This is why we can be reborn as bugs, and they can be reborn as humans.

Ignoring the suffering we cause creatures who live in the ground when we plough fields and calling it "unintentional" when we know full well we are inflicting all kinds of harm on all kinds of creatures, that is a justification. At least I understand that all the food that I eat comes with a price of suffering. I don't pretend that some suffering is excusable and some suffering is not — I certainly do not make a distinction between the suffering of one creature and that of another. I understand that my movement in the world is inevitably harmful whether I intend it or not, and knowing that means that I cannot really claim that I am "unintentionally" harming beings. All I can say is that I did not see a being, and develop the motive to kill it and proceed with that motivation ̦‚ and from the point of view of the Buddha, I am therefore free of the karma of killing. But that also applies to all the meat that I eat.

Arguing that not spending money on meat = saving animals is ludicrous at best.

Actually if you look at the stats: 38 percent of grain products are discarded at point of sale; 50 percent of seafood is discarded at point of sale; 52 percent of fruits and vegetables are discarded at point of sale; 22 percent of meats are discarded at point of sale and 20 percent of dairy are discarded at point of sale. This comes from an estimate made of supermarkets in USA, Canada, Australia and NZ.

What the figures above show is that for every ten pounds of meat we find in the markets, 22 percent of it goes to waste. This means that meat is not being sold into markets based on some precise metric of demand. You may choose not to eat meat, but you are not saving any beings at all by doing so. The supply of meat clearly outpaces demand. The supply of grain, seafood and fruit and vegetables is clearly outpacing demand.

So, especially with regards to fish, your abstaining from eating animals is saving none of the them. Of half the fish in the sea that have vanished in the past 50 years, half of those went to waste, not counting all the other creatures pulled up by nets.

I personally see those things as an intrinsic part of the issue being discussed. The elimination of fossil fuel isn't going to happen tomorrow so in the meantime it's reasonable for one to try to reduce their consumption of them. At least in the US, a vegan uses only 10% of the fossil fuel that a typical omnivore does, with regards to food. Consumption is going to first have to be reduced, in order for them to be eliminated. If one cares about global warming for example, one should be concerned about their own personal carbon footprint that their own lives and choices create IMO. One may not have power over politicians or corporations half a world away, but one does have power over one's own choices.



Malcolm wrote:
No one disagrees that changing industrial agriculture is one of the major keys to climate change — but you are not going to convince "typical omnivores" that they should stop eating meat. You can however convince them to switch to 100% pastured beef. Pigs and chicken will always require grain, which is why, once upon a time, pork and chicken was more expensive than beef, pound for pound.

Very good thread.

Clearly, "mind" is a pretty useless word, almost as bad as "soul" or "consciousness", unless one states from the outset what one means by it. In Buddhism, people have translated, manas, citta ,vijnana, etc. all as "mind", when the terms have completely different meanings. It also obscures the fact that what the English word refers to is a process and not a thing.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, they don't really — Vasubandhu clearly states they are synonyms, distinguished only by time reference, i.e. manas has a past object, vijñāna has a present object, and citta has a future object.

It would be quite interesting and productive if someone with a thorough background in Sanskrit (Vedic as well as Buddhist) could trace these and other Sanskrit mentational words back to their earliest appearances in Indic literature, and then try to discover, using related words in other ancient Indo-European languages, what they originally stemmed from, in the same that the English word "is" ultimately stems from an IE root meaning "breathe".

Malcolm wrote:
This a useful thing to do, but as we know, language is diachronic, it evolves according to need, and there is no reason why we cannot make English terms fit Dharma definitions.

I agree with you. Unfortunately, there is no authority out there that can regulate fishing worldwide. But fisheries management in the US has led to a rebound in fish stocks. The main problem is with developing countries:
In the U.S. this gloomy picture has started to improve, thanks to science-based fisheries management. Thirty-four fish stocks have been declared rebuilt since the year 2000 and more than 90 percent of U.S. fish stocks are not considered overfished. Worldwide, though, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations considers almost 30 percent of fish stocks to be overfished. “The main problem is really in the developing countries where we need more effective institutions for fisheries management,” says Christensen. “We need to get effective management introduced in all countries, or it will have dire consequences.”

“And if, Mahamati, no one ever ate meat, then they wouldn’t kill for that purpose. For most innocent living beings are slaughtered for profit, few for other reasons. It is abominable, Mahamati, that in the over-eagerness of craving for flavor even human flesh is eaten by humans, not to mention the flesh of other living creatures such as animals and birds. Most of this is killed in nets and traps for that purpose, by deluded people afflicted with craving for the taste of meat, as fowlers, herders, fishermen, and so on slaughter innocent creatures of the air, earth, and water in many ways for the sake of profit. And these bitter, cruel-hearted, demoniacal, ruthless people have no concept of living beings as living beings; as they are killing and eating them, they feel no compassion." -- The Lankavatara Sutra

It is only when one has a direct hand in slaughter by either seeing it done, doing it oneself or asking that it be done for you that there is a fault because one is directly party to the suffering of a given creature.

Bacon, ham and sausages rank alongside cigarettes as a major cause of cancer, the World Health Organisation has said, placing cured and processed meats in the same category as asbestos, alcohol, arsenic and tobacco.

The report from the WHO’s cancer arm, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, says there is enough evidence to rank processed meats as group 1 carcinogens, because of a causal link with bowel cancer.

It places red meat in group 2A, as “probably carcinogenic to humans”. Eating red meat is also linked to pancreatic and prostate cancer, the IARC says.

Cows did not evolve to eat corn. So I don't eat corn finished beef.

And yes, the argument about relative quantity of deaths or deaths of insects does hold water:
Although U.S. corn is a highly productive crop, with typical yields between 140 and 160 bushels per acre, the resulting delivery of food by the corn system is far lower. Today’s corn crop is mainly used for biofuels (roughly 40 percent of U.S. corn is used for ethanol) and as animal feed (roughly 36 percent of U.S. corn, plus distillers grains left over from ethanol production, is fed to cattle, pigs and chickens). Much of the rest is exported.  Only a tiny fraction of the national corn crop is directly used for food for Americans, much of that for high-fructose corn syrup.
http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-to-rethink-corn/

This means that the very act of driving vehicles in the US, where there is ethanol in virtually everything involves deaths for just as many creatures as feed for cows.

I've looked at your link to your own quote. It is not clear what you are saying. Are you saying that the Bhavya that is being paraphrased is a Tibetan Bhavya from a period after the 8th century, as opposed to the famous Bhavaviveka also called Bhavya from the 6th century?

I am saying there are two Indian Madhyamaka authors, one who wrote a commentary on the MMK, called Bhavaviveka; another whose works were translated by Atisha, Tarkajvala, Blaze of Dialectics, being one of them.

You say above " I already have shown elsewhere that this is a very inaccurate paraphrase of what Bhavaviveka says" and then in the link you say "It is not a text by Bhavaviveka. Bhavya is a much later master, post Shantarakshita." So is it a paraphrase of Bhavaviveka or isn't it?

Malcolm wrote:
It is a paraphrase of Bhavya, aka Bhavaviveka II

Adamantine said:
And if it is, and you are saying he is later than Śāntarakṣita, how is it that all biographies of Bhavaviveka date him 6th century, while Śāntarakṣita is clearly 8th century?  And while it may be clear to yourself, you have not done a good job of communicating what you think Dudjom Rinpoche's, or Bhavya's, or the Derge canonical edn. of the text: dbu-ma, Vol. Tsha's error is. So, what is it, and who made the original error?

Malcolm wrote:
There are two people referred to by one name. The author of the Madhyamakavrtti is the first, Bhavaviveka I; the author of the text, Tarkajvala, being paraphrased by Dudjom Rinpoche and other gzhan stong pas, is Bhavaviveka II.

While there is no mention of Prasanga or Svatantra in the Tarkajvala, it does mentions a great Madhyamaka. However, that "great Madhyamaka" is defined by how it treats relative truth, i.e. mind only. Coarse outer Madhyamaka treats relative truth in the manner of the Sarvastivadins and so on.

In general, Dudjom Rinpoche repeats an error universally common in Tibetan Buddhism scholastics, and it is by no means confined to him. That is, he cites a version of citation that has been passed down to him in an altered or truncated form without checking the original text to see if it is accurate. This is a big problem with Tibetan treatises in general, not confined to any one school or any one author.

The idea that any diet is less harmful than another, unless you are begging for alms, is the underlying point. Apart from killing animals yourself which is definitely harmful, all diets are equally harmful because they involve someone harming some creature at some time in the production of food.

No, not really. There are of course some parallels, but to say "very, very identical" with Vajrayana Buddhism..." is just exuberant hyperbole and nothing more.

However, it is good that they hold courses on it. People who follow Buddhadharma should learn the tenets of other systems from their exponents in order to be clear about where there are similarities, and more importantly, where there are differences.

It's a shorthand cipher for Sanskrit concepts like "citta" and "vijnana."

I tend not to use the term "mind" to translate Buddhist concepts such as Buddha-nature or Dharmata; there are other shorthand terms for that.

I'm glad you've initiated this thread, because the term "mind" really is a muddle in English-language Buddhist discourse.

Malcolm wrote:
The term "mind" in English is a container metaphor. "What I have in mind...", "The thought arose in my mind..."

Consciousness on the other hand is not a container metaphor, it is a description of the awareness a mind has, dating no earlier than Locke.

In reality, "mind" comes from PIE, *men, leading to Latin mēns:

mind
intellect
reasoning, judgement

The actual word "mind: comes from is Proto-Germanic/gamundiz, leading to old English:

ġemynd:

memory; commemoration:

Sure. But if someone is going to say "it's not appropriate to claim" or something like that. Then you should be behaving in the same way as you advise. Otherwise, you're just being hypocritical. If it's inappropriate to marginalize Tibetan views of eating meat, then it's equally inappropriate to marginalize East Asian views.

Malcolm wrote:
In fact there is a long and strong tradition of vegetarianism in Tibet. But it is not universally maintained, and not merely because "Tibetans can't grow vegetables."

The reality that seems to escape many people who advocate a literal interpretation of the Buddha's teachings on not eating meat, is that being a conventional living being who eats food involves harming other beings no matter what kind of diet one follows. The Buddha never made vegetarianism mandatory, even though Devadattva insisted that he should. What the Buddha made mandatory was that we should not directly participate in taking the life of other beings, if possible, though in Mahāyāna ethics, even this is not absolute. The real point I am trying to make is that the Buddha no where taught that our liberation was dependent on our diet. For example, do you think bodhisattvas who live in rakṣasa dimensions convert them into vegans?

How about the Lankavatara Sutra: “Because it is produced from semen and blood, too, Mahamati, meat should not be eaten by a bodhisattva, out of a desire for purity. And because it causes anxiety in beings, Mahamati, a practicing bodhisattva wishing friendliness of beings should not eat any meat at all."

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, of course there are Mahāyāna sūtras where the Buddha recommends vegetarianism. It is also equally true that Bhavaviveka addresses these issues in his famed Tarkajvala:
If one eats meat after creating suffering for the bodies of creatures, this will possess a fault, but if there is no mind in the creature when the meat is eaten, where can there be a misdeed if no suffering arises? Just as when one uses mother pearl, or the excrescences of fish and elephants, or peacock feathers, yak tails, teeth, bones, skin and so on, there is little or no suffering for the creature, just as when one uses fruit, water and so on there is no harm at all, in the same way, since there is no harm when meat is eaten, there is no fault. If there is a fault, then cremating the dead will be a misdeed.
Even in Mahāyāna, the Buddha never forbids using wool, using feathers, using leather, bone, shell, and many other kinds of animal products. It is inconsistent to claim that the passages where Buddha enjoins us not to eat meat must be taken as definitive teachings.

Bhavaviveka, whose Mahāyāna credentials are impeccable, certain opines that it is not necessary to take these passages literally. He points out that if the suffering of creatures is the problem we want to solve then we must avoid eating rice, sesame oil, and all kinds of other products which involve suffering for creatures.

Instead, we need to understand that this advice is aimed at people who kill animals or have them killed in order to eat them and that is all.

As I previously explained, they will not be liberated, even though they do have the dhātu, just as in the case of the youth who engaged in asceticism. Why is that? Because they are very careless.

“Mañjuśrī, the Tathāgata is in the realm of non-arising. On the other hand, he appears in the world as a reflected image. According to the beliefs of sentient beings he displays diverse appearances and diverse lifespans. He appears among sentient beings who have become fitting receptacles for awakening thanks to their maturation and belief. These sentient beings then hear the Dharma according to their dispositions and beliefs. According to their dispositions they understand the three vehicles, and according to their dispositions they obtain belief."

And

“Mañjuśrī, there is no Tathāgata. However, the designation ‘Tathāgata’ comes about in the world because of the voice of Dharma. It is exclusively due to the maturation of sentient beings’ previous wholesome karma that they perceive the voice of the Tathāgata. That voice emerges in order to produce happiness for all sentient beings and to prompt those who are careless. Mañjuśrī, as those sentient beings hear that sound, they form the concept of a tathāgata, thinking, ‘This is the Tathāgata’s body.’"

Hello,

The following is just one practitioner's opinion from a small corner-non-corner of Buddhism.

It may be that the negative spirits are just the heart-mind. When the heart and mind are at peace, the negative spirits disappear with the breeze. They never were real from the start except for the mind's own making them real.

So, just sit, dropping all thought of spirits and their negativity and ... poof ... a certain Positive Peace may be found instead.

Better, however, to ask your own Teacher in your own Tradition.

The root tantra of the seventeen dzogchen tantras received by Padmasambhava from Shri Singha is called "The Reverberation of Sound tantra" (Dra Talgyur Root Tantra "sgra thal 'gyur gym rgyud") and the practice is described therein. It has not been translated yet, although there is an effort underway in Austria at the direction of Chogyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche

When the commentary is published, I think you will be a little surprised at what this practice actually is. The root tantra itself does not devote more than a few stanzas to describing it. The commentary sets out in detail how one actually enters into the sounds of the four elements. But most importantly, it is a preliminary practice.

These are Chinese martial arts and the Chinese adherents claim this as their tradition. Lama Pai, Tibetan White Crane (not to be confused with Fujian Style White Crane), Lama or Tibetan Kungfu, and Hop Gar, according to tradition, originated in far Western China in the border regions with Tibet and then moved to north China and then down south. An American student of Tibetan White Crane published his research which which indicates a Northern China origin, contrary to received tradition.

BTW, internal and external martial arts adherents also claim the "Indian" (probably Central Asian in origin although as far south as Sri Lanka have been claimed) Bodhidharma as their founder. Is any of this historically true? Possibly, but it would seem more likely that various schools of physical practice borrowed from each other, eventually merged, and then people invented a unified historical origin. It does seem likely that some yoga exercises made their way to China and influenced physical practice there. It is a fascinating topic in intellectual history and diffusion.

alpha said:
I do not think there is a transfer of energy from guru to disciple because during a real direct introduction there isnt any guru that gives or transfers something to the disciple .But some of us take part in a direct introduction with the expectation that we might get something which we dont already have.

Malcolm wrote:
The term direct introduction is a bit misleading. The term is translated from the tibetan, which is rang ngo thog tu phrad, "directly encounter your own state." This direct introduction or encounter is facilitated by a Guru, but as you correctly note, nothing is transferred per se, because the guru is merely showing you your own face [ rang ngo ] or your own state [ rang ngo ] in a direct encounter [ thog tu phrad ]. This is done on the basis of experiences, as the example of Nyoshul Lungtog's encounter with Patrul Rinpoche:
Nyoshul Lungtok, who later became one of the greatest Dzogchen masters of recent times, followed his teacher Patrul Rinpoche for about eighteen years. During all that time, they were almost inseparable. Nyoshul Lungtok studied and practiced extremely diligently, and accumulated a wealth of purification, merit, and practice; he was ready to recognize the Rigpa, but had not yet had the final introduction. Then, one famous evening, Patrul Rinpoche gave him the introduction. It happened when they were staying together in one of the hermitages high up in the mountains above Dzogchen Monastery. It was a very beautiful night. The dark blue sky was clear and the stars shone brilliantly. The sound of their solitude was heightened by the distant barking of a dog from the monastery below. Patrul Rinpoche was lying stretched out on the ground, doing a special Dzogchen practice. He called Nyoshul Lungtok over to him, saying: "Did you say you do not know the essence of the mind?" Nyoshul Lungtok guessed from his tone that this was a special moment and nodded expectantly.

"There's nothing to it really," Patrul Rinpoche said casually, and added, "My son, come and lie down over here: be like your old father." Nyoshul Lungtok stretched out by his side.

Then Patrul Rinpoche asked him, "Do you see the stars up there in the sky?"
"Yes."

"Do you hear the dogs barking in Dzogchen Monastery?"
"Yes."

"Do you hear what I'm saying to you?"
"Yes."

"Well, the nature of Dzogchen is this: simply this."

Nyoshul Lungtok tells us what happened then: "At that instant, I arrived at a certainty of realization from within. I had been liberated from the fetters of 'it is' and 'it is not.' I had realized the primordial wisdom, the naked union of emptiness and intrinsic awareness. I was introduced to this realization by his blessing, as the great Indian master Saraha said: He in whose heart the words of the master have entered, Sees the truth like a treasure in his own palm."
The sad part is that someone will take this literally, think that they should go somewhere, lie on the ground, listen to dogs bark and think this is direct introduction.

As you know, direct introduction is not introducing you to something you don't have. It is introducing you to something you have always had, and misplaced. This is one reason why the Buddhanature metaphor useful in Dzogchen, but here it means something a bit different than in lower yanas [cue, Son of the Buddha].

For one thing, "pointing out", ngo phrod is generally a Mahāmudra term. Direct introduction, " rang ngo thog du phrad, " literally, "directly encountering one's own state" is a Dzogchen term.

In the lineages I have had the good fortune to be part of, this is often not taken as a formal ritual at all, and the actual transmission on this level happens in a different way, in the context of very close teacher-student relationship, one to one, over the course of time. And it is never formal. Although it is a direct introduction it bears no resemblance at all to the DI as given within the Dzogchen Community. It is in fact so different in look, and feel, as if it is a completely different thing. This is why many older Tibetan lamas have such a problem with what Norbu Rinpoche is doing. I myself do not.

So, the Direct Introductions were received through means of a book. There is one question I had about Guru Padmasambhava's "Self-Liberation." I had quoted the Guru where he said four times that the text was a "direct introduction to your intrinsic awareness," but the quotations were rejected as false.

Malcolm wrote:
Steve, what was rejected was your conclusion about what the quotes mean. The text you cited was an oral text written down by someone. They are Guru Padmasabhava's speech, not a book written out by an author. When a guru presents that text, he does so because he has received the lung for that text and knows how to present it. For you, that Guru is the same as Guru Padmasambhava.

steve_bakr said:
The question I wanted to ask was, "Are we to believe Guru Padmasambhava or not?" "Did he tell the truth or not?" If Guru Padmasambhava reiterates that same point four times, is it even permissible to say that he is wrong all four times? Isn't he a venerated source?

Malcolm wrote:
Steve, no one is saying that what Guru Rinpoche said is wrong. Your understanding is wrong.

When he was teaching, he was giving direct introduction through words to a group of students. Which students? Principally a translator named Chogro Lui Gyaltsen, who is renowned as one of the translators of the 17 Tantras. Also Yeshe Tsogyal, she was the direct heir to these teachings. Karma Lingpa was the reincarnation of Chogro and the one appointed to promulgate them. So what you are reading is a record of one of Guru Padmasambhava's teaching sessions. Guru Rinpoche in fact wrote very little, but he taught a lot and those recorded teachings are what we now have as the treasure tradition. But they are all just so many books without proper empowerment, reading transmission and instruction

After Karma Lingpa revealed the text, he gave the empowerments, the lung and the teachings to his sun, Nyida Chojey, who then spread it widely. Ever since then it is a teaching that has been passed down in connection with the empowerment of the peaceful and wratful deities in his tradition. I have this transmission as do many people you are talking to. You can easily get this transmission, it is given rather frequently, and I am sure if you ask someone to teach you the text, respectfully and with a beginners attitude, you will have no problem.

The main reason Reynolds translated it again was to correct Evans Wentz's and Jung's misunderstandings of the text.

I agree with this, as I said before: pointing out instructions are not necessarily given with a label, or warning. Fourth empowerments and rikpa tsel wangs still have a bit of that expectation. There is another approach, which is quite spontaneous, and the disciple will only know it was a pointing out if they "get it". I believe true Dzogchen masters are giving a type of pointing out all of the time, in infinite ways, and if one has the opportunity to spend significant time with one, they should jump at it.

Ivo said:
Very true. One of my closest teachers once told me that his own teacher (a pivotal figure in the recent history of the Nyingma) never gave them this type of direct introduction at all, and only gave them lungs for the various direct introduction traditional texts in order for them to find the experience by themselves. He also never gave commentaries on any Dzogchen texts to his heart disciples, even on the seven treasures and YL, only lungs. And he was the master of masters.

Malcolm wrote:
Ivo, as you very well know, the extremely unelaborate empowerment of the four Nyinthig empowerments is precisely a direct introduction. So what are you talking about?

Of course you have to discover Dzogchen knowledge through your own experience, and of course, having been ripened with the rig pa'i rtsal dbang through whichever of the three ways it can be given — pandita style, secret mantra style or pointing out for old ladies —  then of course one takes whatever practice texts one needs and goes and does Dzogchen practices such as rushen, etc. and eliminates one's doubts. But the effectiveness of Dzogchen practice comes about through one's interaction with a teacher and practices they give one, not from reading books and developing nice fantasies about what Dzogchen might be based on reading Western translations without a proper teacher.

People who only read English translations of these texts without access to a Tibetan teacher who can clarify for them what this and that actually means are like blind people in a cave who have been given flashlight with dead batteries to find their way out.

I have been patiently explaining for many days now, ever since steve showed up. Not only myself, but many other people.

Anyone who has been a student of Norbu Rinpoche for any length of time knows that you really should receive the transmission for any Dzgchen text you wish to study. Dzogchen texts are not meant to be read in absence of proper instruction. Yes, of course, when you know the meaning, then one Dzogchen text is just as good as another, they all have the same meaning more or less, depending on whether we are talking about sems sde, klong sde, or man ngag sde. Still, if you want to really work with a text, then the proper way to do it is to find someone who will teach you the text in a proper way. This was how it was done in Tibet, we are no different today. If you can't find someone to teach you that text, then you find someone who will teach you any text of Dzogchen. The text does not matter, what matters is whether the master has genuine realization of the teachings of Dzogchen.

With this post I am actually quoting a recognized authority, so the disclaimer in my signature does not apply.

Starting around the 15 minute mark in the following link
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGzN4FAFgTs
Alan Wallace talks about the various approaches to Dzogchen. At one end of the spectrum is getting the "pointing out instructions" (D.I. by a different name) in a weekend retreat without any other preparations approach. He affirms that this is a valid approach, what we would call "top down". At the other end of the spectrum is spending 20 years studying the texts and then going off and doing long retreats. He said his teacher didn't teach him either of those two ways but was a third way, just practice based. Plus obviously there is the "bottom up" approach with progressing through the lower 8 yanas.

Around the 17 minute mark he talks about what the pointing out instructions are like. At first he calls them "mind to mind transmission" but then he says it isn't literal. He does say it is "...a resonance, an affinity, a transmission..." where metaphorically the clouds can part for a moment or a minute. It's at the 20 minute mark he says in 24 years his teacher Gyaltrul R. never gave him pointing out instructions.

There is more than one way approach the subject. Our tendency to dismiss or exclude the entire spectrum of approaches here at DW tends to make the discussions somewhat myopic.

Garudavista said:
I believe Alan Wallace may not have needed pointing out instructions because he was practicing Mahamudra and not Dzogchen. Although the base for both is the same, the methods are quite different.

A direct introduction is a context for the "glimpse of rikpa". And a manifestation of a true method for attaining liberation.

No, Ivo. Rig pa is a result of direct introduction, or otherwise working with methods to discover the meaning of that introduction.

While I generally agree with Malcolm that ChNNR's view seems pretty well laid out, this is from his 1989 Forward to Self-Liberation through Seeing with Naked Awareness:
...This is our Primordial State. But in order to recognize it, we first need transmission from a realized master in the form of an introduction (ngo-sprod) to the state of presence and awareness (rig-pa). This introduction, this meeting face-to-face, is precisely the function of the present text, which reports the very words of Guru Padmasambhava introducing his disciples to such presence or awarenesss."

You cannot have it both ways, Ivo. You cannot on the one hand claim that you never said that direction introduction can be gained from a book, and on the other hand claim that it can.

In the hands of a master, any number of texts, hundreds, if not thousands of them are effective means for giving direct introduction — but in reality, a master does not need a book to give direct introduction. But without being received from a master, no text of introduction is effective, no matter how many of them one reads.

And... while I am still in my recreational break, which went far too long today, I may as well state, in full compliance with the DW tradition to put words into our teachers' mouths, that during all the years I have spent trying to find my way in Dzogchen with the help of a number of teachers, I have never met a teacher who would state that a person can not have an authentic rikpa experience by oneself, be it reading books or whatever. Even a total beginner, in fact, it is easier for them. So I can safely say for myself that I know of no Dzogchen teacher who would state that as a fact, including ChNN if asked one to one. This doesn't mean that my teachers would present this as a path or valid option for beginners, or talk about this on public talks, but denying that it might happen is absurd. In my opinion it shows a total lack of understanding of what Dharma is and what the samsaric condition actually is.

Malcolm wrote:
Rig pa, Ivo, is knowledge, as opposed to ma rig pa, ignorance.

You seem to be claiming that ordinary people can have knowledge of their primordial state spontaneously. If this were true, there would never have been any need at all for teachers and teachings.

I have never met one single authentic teacher of Dzogchen who would claim that one could have this experiential knowledge [rig pa] without it having first been introduced to one by a master.

People can experience the nature of the mind [George] without introduction, just as they can see George on a train everyday without knowing [ma rig pa] who George is. When people are introduced to the knowledge of the nature of the their minds, then we can say they have "rig pa".

Rig pa and the nature of the mind aka primordial state aka basis, are not the same thing. The fact that people continually conflate these two is unfortunate. But if you pay attention to ChNN, he says repeatedly, "rig pa is not the nature of the mind, rig pa is knowledge or instant presence in the nature of the mind."

Termas are also part of the oral tradition.

Also tertons, by definition, must be realized Dzogchen masters.

We are talking about a beginner, someone who has never met George. They might see George every day on the subway, but they will never know who George is. However, when they are at last introduced to George by someone who knows George, they will say, "Oh, I see you everyday on the Subway." After that point, they will always recognize George, even if he changes his suit, hat, shoes, etc. But without that introduction, they will never recognize George, and George, being rather disinterested in people, will never walk up and introduce himself, saying, "I am George."

What I am saying is that your argument is explicitly rejected in the Tantras of Dzogchen. The Rig pa Rang shar gives the following account. Follow it closely and you can see that your point of view is explicitly negated. The context of the argument, btw, is to prove that Buddhahood is attained merely through an introduction.
[Opponent]
The opponents reply to that:
all phenomena are nondual.
Therefore, there cannot be duality.
Since there are no sentient beings, there are no buddhas.
Therefore, [nonduality] is freedom from the extremes of dualistic appearances.

[Reply]
Now then, is this stated in the ultimate sense,
or stated for the objects of deluded appearances?
Our reply to that and the demonstration of the proofs:
that this is so in in the ultimate sense,
but there is a dualistic appearance in the objects of deluded appearances.

[Opponent]
The  opponents rebuttal to that:
because there is no duality in the ultimate sense, 
it is not reasonable for there to be duality in objects of deluded appearances. 
Why? Because there is no duality in the ultimate sense. 
In that case it is reasonable that all sentient beings
could be liberated without the need for effort. 
Why? Because duality does not exist in the basis. 

[Reply]
Now then, how is duality asserted? 
The reply to that is:
when there are no buddhas and no sentient beings, 
there is no second or third in the basis. 
Because the potentiality of play arises from that [basis], 
buddhas and sentient beings arise as a duality.

[Opponent]
Now it is asserted that duality exists in the basis.
Because there is no good or bad in the basis,
for what reason is it said to exist as a duality? 
In that case, there cannot be transformation. 
Why? It is reasonable that sentient beings do not attain buddhahood. 
For example, even though coal
is polished, it will never become white. 
In the same way, deluded sentient beings
will never become buddhas through practicing meditation. 

[Reply]
Next, the reply is given like this:
because it exists to be demonstrated, 
the result is attained through the demonstration.
If not demonstrated, how can there be liberation? 

There are no signs in the dharmas of the basis, 
no grasping to the dharmas of the path,
and no attainment of the dharmatā of the result. 
The basis of sentient beings and the basis of buddhahood
is definitely differentiated by a sole difference.
 For what reason is there a sole difference? 
Why is it called “the sole difference”?
The basis of buddhahood is pristine consciousness [ye shes]; 
the basis of sentient beinghood is not pristine consciousness. 
When both the primordial state (ye) and recognition (shes pa) are combined, 
it is the sublime transcendent state of the buddhas.
I really think you need to reconsider your arrogance on this point. There are people here who understand Dzogchen far better than you. You should listen to them. On the Guru, for example, another of the 17 Tantras, the Precious Introduction Tantra, states:
Investigating into the intimate instructions of the Guru, one reaches the extent of effortless self-liberation.
The Rig pa Rang shar, the commentary tantra of Dzogchen, also chimes in the faults of not obtaining empowerments. Now mind you, this does not mean that one necessarily needs some kind of empowerment into an outer mandala and so on, as the Rig pa Rang Shar makes clear. That depends on the faculties of the student. But this tantra makes it absolutely clear that one must receive at least direct introduction from a proper master:
The faults of not obtaining the empowerment are as follows: in the bardo one is alarmed, panicked, exhausted, impeded and one can also lose consciousness. 
“While one has not left the body of traces, migrating beings will not see one as worthy of respect. One’s merit will be small, one’s life short, one’s enjoyments of living will be few, one will be powerless and many obstacles will occur. Nothing will be accomplished. Those are the faults of not obtaining the empowerment for the conduct of Secret Mantra. A yogin of Secret Mantra conduct must first obtain empowerment. If empowerment is not obtained, not even the Buddha will be able to turn the wheel on the stage of a tathāgata. If the wheel cannot be turned, then the nirmanakāya will not be able to benefit migrating beings with compassion. Therefore, the empowerment of the conduct of Secret Mantra must be obtained.
The root tantra of all Dzogchen teachings, the Sgra thal gyur, states:
Serve the guru as equal to a buddha
by pleasing him/her with activities of body and speech.
And:
The Dharma is in accord with the transmission of the Guru.
Finally, since you like the Kun byed rgyal po, then heed what it says:

Without an authentic master, like the scripture of a monkey, 
the basis and path will be erroneous, indeed one will be seized by conceptuality.
Therefore, like applying ferrous sulfate to gold, the precious master
should be paid with a gem of inestimable value.
This is also part of the lung called rtsal chen sprug pa, one of the five lungs brought to Tibet by Vairocana.

The Great Garuda, another one of the five lungs and also part of the Kun byed rgyal po states:
The virtuous mentor is like a precious jewel which produces everything.
Unsupported, not depending on places of transformation,
he fulfills hope through his excellent inner nature.
When examined, nothing; but he has the great excellence of producing a variety for others.
Finally, you should heed Mañjuśrīmitra [Garab Dorje's main disciple], who states in yet another of the five lungs brought by Vairocana, the Meditation of Awakened Mind:
Subtle and difficult to understand, this path of the great seer is beyond nonconceptuality and conceptuality,
difficult to analyze and difficult to explain, free from conventional expressions,
inaccessible through words, while it is not shared with the domain of others and all of the immature,
this meaning can here be seen through those definitive scriptures of the Teacher and the experiential intimate instructions of the gurus.
So, given these definitive statements in original texts of the Dzogchen tradition, you can see why no one agrees with your baseless and harmful assertions. However, you are free to following the three words of Jim Valby:
Introduce yourself to some delusion.
Spread it as widely as possible. 
Continue in that state forever.
Because that is all you are doing, sad to say.

Of course we should stick to tradition and don't become secular buddhist or something strange like that. But especially when using tantric methods, it is very important for them to be connected with the place you are practising. Otherwise they just don't really work that much! Himalayan plants are no more special or more connected with spirits than any other special plants from other areas of the world. So everybody that stated that "you should stick to tradition", please ask yourself, what the real essence of the tradition is.

Malcolm wrote:
Actually, when using these things, you should be very aware of the environmental impact you are having. For example, in Tibetan Medicine, it is held that one should use medicines from one's region, as these will be the most potent for you. Also, the trees from which gugul, sandalwood oil, myrrh, frankincense, aloes [agar] and so on are extracted endangered.

In Mexico, there are over 5,000 plant species useful for medicine, and very little of it has been documented in one place, much less made accessible for non-Indians to understand and use.

As far as Himalayan plants go, however, they have a special potency because of the altitude at which they grow. Alpine instances of a plant are held to be stronger than an instance grown at a lower altitude. Why? Because the distance between flower and root is shorter, and therefore the plant as a whole is held to be more potent.

She was completely unable to distance herself from big money. She refused to say that the big banks should be busted up [they should].

She could not effectively respond to the charge that she changes her opinions based on political expediency.

Her reply to Sanders that US was not Denmark was not an reply, it was lame.

She also does not support free college tuition [boo].

The only place where she gained traction with Sanders was on gun control.

But I happen to agree with Bernie on this point. He voted against the Brady Bill because IT DID NOT SUPPORT INSTANT BACKGROUND CHECKS. It is also true that VT is a rural state with the lowest rates of gun violence in the US, etc. This is why Sanders has the position on guns that he does. People in VT hunt for food. It is a poor state. Gun policies that are good for cities are not necessarily appropriate for rural areas.

Loppon-la,

Can you tell us what the difference is between a mantra and a dharani? In at least one entry from the gZungs 'Dus, the title says it's a dharani, but then in the body of the sutra, it says to recite this "mantra" X number of times. Is there an actual traditional definition of a dharani?

Thank you.

Malcolm wrote:
A dhāraṇī, properly speaking, is a formula for recalling the Dharma and developing wisdom and removing nonvirtues which can cause problems.

Generally, we find a description of three mantras: guhyamantras, vidyāmantras and dhāraṇī-mantras. A text called the Abhisamayavibhaṅga by Atisha statesz:
Because of protecting against mundane thoughts with reality, there are so-called secret mantras. As such, because of giving arise to special knowledge when invoked again and again, there are vidyāmantras. In order generate unfailing recollection of bodhicitta, there are dhāraṇī-mantras.
Further, an interesting text called the sGra sbyor bam po gnyis pa gives the following definitions:
A so-called mantra is mantregupti bhāśaṇe, i.e. because it is a description of the deities of mantra being summoned and secret, it is called "secret mantra." So-called "vidyā" is vidajñāna: it is name of abiding as the form of a deity in order counteract ignorance. So called "dhāraṇi" is artha granṭha dhārayati dhāraṇi: a name for not forgetting the meaning and the words of Mantra Dharma and obtaining a specific stage, thus, "dhāraṇimantra."
Further, we can make four more distinctions:  dhāraṇis that become the cause of a bodhisattvas obtaining patience, Secret Mantra dhāraṇis, dhāraṇi of Dharma and dhāraṇi of meaning. This distinction is found in the commentary on the Prajñāpāramita by Daṃṣṭrasena.

The first kind is a result of attaining patience for emptiness because of meditating with wisdom and mindfulness.

The second is a dhāraṇī mantra that possesses the power of blessings is a dhāraṇī of Secret Mantra because of an aspiration that was made to remove negativities for sentient beings.

Third, the dhāraṇī of Dharma is when bodhisattvas on the stages listen to buddhas and bodhisattvas no matter how many words of Dharma there are held and recalled with wisdom as they were explained, and this ability to not forget them for a long time is called dhāraṇi of Dharma.

Finally, the dhāraṇī of meaning simply remembering the Dharma terms of the paths, perfections, and so on.

So, my understanding is that dhāraṇis that come from sutra do not require transmission. Dhāraṇis that come from tantra, may, depending on the level of tantra. It seems that many dhāraṇis that seem to require transmission in the Tibetan tradition do not require transmission in East Asian traditions.

More research should be done because there are so many dhārṇis that do not have explicit rites of transmissions connected with them.

Hello,

The following is just one possibility, an interpretation, by one practitioner.

I feel that if you could travel back in time to meet the person who was the historical Buddha, before all the legends and hagiographical writings which (perhaps as a possibility) imposed a potentially idealized image on who he was, you would meet a man, a human being. He may have been a very special man, with great gifts, but just a man. If so, there is a good chance that he exhibited more ordinary human emotions than we give him credit for, and might have had some buttons that could be pushed at a certain point like most people.

On the other "one hand clapping" hand, if one is speaking of the "Big B" Buddha which represents emptiness, all reality and then some ... there is no separate you me or the other guy, nothing lacking ... thus no anger is possible.

The historical man who was buddha and ol' "Big B" are not two.

Just one opinion to toss into the stew, and not intended as the final word on Buddhism.

The discourses in the sutra are supposedly spoken explanations. Since Mahamati and the Buddha are talking to each other, it is out of place to say that "apart from spoken explanations". Making an exception of verbal communication is problematic whether the sutra is meant as a spoken discourse or as a written text. If it is a spoken discourse, the whole sutra is an exception, like any other sutra. If it is a written text, it negates everything found there, including the stated exception. So, unlike other versions of the Lankavatara, the Tibetan seems to be in error.

Malcolm wrote:
Actually, what they are discussing, as is very clear from the Tibetan, is the deficiency of text [letters, yi ge, akṣara ] in conveying meaning. The term being translated as "word" in the text is śabda, sound. The text says the fault is that sounds/words can fall down into letters. It then contrasts letters with spoken explanations, and then points out that even spoken explanations are deluded, because they are made in accordance with the inclination of deluded sentient beings. So no, while the Tibetan translating is not inaccurate, the Chinese translations do not manage to convey the real nuances of the passage, sorry to say.

In the first passage you cited, the Buddha is saying that sounds [ śabda ] and meanings are not different, because sounds can lead to understanding. He never says that reading or text can. This is because Buddhadharma is and always will be a oral tradition based on verbal explanations that are heard by students.



Astus said:
Then of course there many, many statements like the following from the Ārya-niṣṭhāgantabhagavajjñānavaipūlya-sūtraratnānanta-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

Malcolm wrote:
There are several statements on the importance of good friends already in the early discourses (e.g. "the whole of the holy life" in the http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.002.than.html ). However, it does not address the difference between written and oral communication. That sutta itself explains that the importance of a good friend is visible in the fact that the Buddha himself taught the noble eightfold path, based on which beings can attain liberation. In another discourse ( http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an08/an08.054.than.html ) the Buddha teaches that lay people should learn virtue, generosity and discernment by associating with good lay friends. But that doesn't mean they could not learn the same qualities by listening to the Buddha and his monastic disciples, since there are quite a few cases where people gain faith and insight from a single teaching. Good friends are also said ( http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an09/an09.001.than.html ) to be a prerequisite for developing the wings to self-awakening, because through them one learns the Dharma. The reason for it being a prerequisite is because one has to learn of the teachings. It does not say that the source is limited to face to face communication using voice.[/quote]

Your objection has nothing to do with the passage at hand. There are so many other passages just like it, it would take days to collect and translate them all. There is absolutely no precedence in the sūtras for the idea that you can learn Buddhadharma by reading books.

No one ever said the three kāyas were separable.

In Dzogchen it is held that from the point of view of the basis, the three kāyas are the dharmakāya; from the point of view of the path, the three kāyas are the sambhogakāya; from the point of view of result, the three kāyas are the nirmanakāya. The three kāyas are always inseparable.

The reason there is a "difference" between them has to do the fact that ordinary sentient beings and bodhisattvas on the lower stages can see only the nirmanakāya; higher bodhisattvas can see the sambhogakāya; only buddhas can see the dharmakāya.

In other words, Samantabhadra, the dharmakāya, always has a sambhogakāya and a nirmanakāya Why? For as long as there are deluded sentient beings, the buddhas appear to teach them.

I agree with Malcolm on the incompleteness of the texts. I've studied with teachers from every vehicle, and the "how to" is never clearly spelled out in the texts I've seen. The Pali suttas are pretty detailed with meditation, but even these aren't really like how meditation is taught by teachers. Especially with Zen, there's no way to know by yourself if you "get" a koan. The best you can do is piece together something like zazen in non-Sutric commentaries, and even then I would bet most people get it wrong. Heck, I got it wrong even under the supervision of a teacher, and I doubt I'm unusual in this aspect. And Dogen, the big promoter of non-koan zazen, says you need to have a teacher. In fact, out of the whole history of zen, you have maybe one or two Chinul like characters out of probably hundreds of thousands of dedicated students. This is liek planning your retirement around winning the lottery. Sure, it could happen, but the chances are so low to be negligible.

Anyone who has meditated in a group knows there is a far different energy at play than when meditating alone. So to say there's nothing transmitted, out of fear for sounding New Age, I think is nonsense. There's an energy at work there, just like there's an energy at work when you play board games live instead of over the internet, or have a face to face conversation over texting.

Then there is a logical problem. Buddhism generally tells us we have a knowledge problem, we start off in ignorance. To think that an ignorant person can guide themselves out of ignorance seems specious at best.

Malcolm wrote:
What I am claiming is that oral communication and teaching is different than reading. For example, our conversation here is dry and logical [at least my side of the conversation is]. If we were talking, or I was listening to you teach Dharma, there is a qualitatively different sort of communication happening.

Astus said:
That is meta-communication, all those other things that go on during a face-to-face conversation. It is not a matter of words being pronounced or written. Then there are two options to maintain that orality is the only way of communicating the Dharma: either that words combined with other signifiers/expressions transmit the whole, or that words are irrelevant and only the other expressions convey the meaning. It also raises the question if anything can be communicated at all through the written form.

One of the advantages of texts is exactly their "dry and logical" nature (although I wouldn't dismiss the literary arts as capable of more than that). Unlike spontaneous verbal communication, writing generally requires some focus and organising of thoughts, except perhaps instant messaging.
The Buddha also addresses this issue later on in the text, beginning on folio 212/a of the Lhasa edition:
That being the case, therefore Mahāmati, apart from spoken explanations, the Buddha and the other bodhisattvas have taught "The Tathāgatas have never explained and will never explain even a single letter." Why? For this reason, because in all Dharmas there are no letters, in absence of the meaning [the Dharma] cannot be explained. There is an explanation through taking hold of concepts. Mahāmati, if Dharma is not explained, the doctrine will perish. If the doctrine perishes, there will be no buddhas, pratyekabuddhas and śravakas.
"For this reason, Mahamati, it is declared in the canonical text by myself and other Buddhas and Bodhisattvas that not a letter is uttered or answered by the Tathagatas. For what reason? Because truths are not dependent on letters. It is not that they never declare what is in conformity with meaning; when they declare anything, it is according to the discrimination [of all beings]. If, Mahamati, the truth is not declared1 [in words] the scriptures containing all truths will disappear, and when the scriptures disappear there will be no Buddhas, Sravakas, Pratyekabuddhas, and Bodhisattvas; and when there is no one [to teach], what is to be taught and to whom?"
(Lankavatara Sutra, 3.76)

There is no mention of an exception for "spoken explanations" in Suzuki's translation. In T670 it says "我等諸佛及諸菩薩，不說一字、不答一字。" (We, all buddhas, and all bodhisattvas, don't say a word, don't respond a word.), in T671 it says "是故我經中說，諸佛如來乃至不說一字不示一名" (It is because I say in the scriptures, all buddha-tathagatas don't go as far as saying a single word or giving a single name.), , and in T672 it says "我經中說，我與諸佛及諸菩薩，不說一字不答一字。" (I say in the scriptures, I, and all buddhas, and all bodhisattvas, don't say a word, don't respond a word). So, neither of the three Chinese Lankavatara translations speak of such an exception.

Malcolm wrote:
The Tibetan text is extremely clear on this point. I don't much care what the Chinese translations or Suzuki's incredibly inaccurate paraphrase state.

Mahāmati, those foolish men say the following, "The meaning is exactly the words. The meaning is not other than the words. Why? For this reason: since there is no substance in the meaning, the meaning is not other than the words. The word itself is the meaning." 

Mahāmati, since the nature of words are not understood, those with uneducated mind cannot understand that how words arise and perish and the meaning does not arise and does not perish. 

Mahāmati, words fall into letters. The meaning does not fall into letters, not arising and lacking substance because of being free from entities and nonentities. 

Mahāmati, because letters are not perceived to either exist or not exist, the Tathāgātas do not teach a Dharma that falls into letters.

Mahāmati, because there are no letters in the Dharma, whoever explains a Dharma that falls into letters, he is twisted up. That being the case, therefore Mahāmati, apart from spoken explanations, the Buddha and the other bodhisattvas have taught "The Tathāgatas have never explained and will never explain even a single letter." Why? For this reason, because in all Dharmas there are no letters, in absence of the meaning [the Dharma] cannot be explained. There is an explanation through taking hold of concepts.

That being the case, therefore Mahāmati, bodhisattva mahāsattvas must not be attached the words of the spoken explanations. 

Mahāmati, since the spoken explanations exist in accordance with the inclinations of sentient beings, they are erroneous. I and all other tathāgata, arhat, samyaksambuddhas teach the Dharma to interested sentient beings in order to reverse their minds, intellects and consciousnesses. All phenomena are nonexistent appearances. Because they are understood as appearances of one's mind, the realization of one's own sublime wisdom can never be reversed by many kinds of false concepts. 

Mahāmati, bodhisattvas mahāsattvas must rely on the meaning, they must not rely on letters. 

Mahāmati, the sons and daughters of good families who rely on letters will be deprived of the meaning, and further, will not understand it. They will not being learned in the characteristics of all the Dharmas and the stages, and they will have as their associates evil intellectuals who do not understand the sentences and the certain words will fall into evil views.

Astus said:
We can certainly come to understand the meaning of the Dharma by studying with a teacher. We can never come to understand the meaning of the Dharma merely by reading books.
Does a teacher gives any Dharma not contained in the sutras? If yes, then his teaching fails to follow the Dharma of the buddhas. If no, then sutras are both valid and beneficial sources of the Dharma.

Prajnaparamita is not obtained from anyone or anything. How could a person today instruct in that better than the Buddha?

"Wherever this sutra is taught, read, recited, copied, or wherever it is to be found, one should build a seven-jeweled stupa of great height and width and richly ornamented. There is no need to put a relic inside. Why is this? Because the Tathāgata is already in it. ... the highest, complete enlightenment of all the bodhisattvas is within this sutra.

In principle offering "fragrant smoke" is the same, if in indian incense form or

With Riwo Sang Cho mother mixes you also have ingredients like the 3 sweets and three whites,
which you also have in tormas, which are based on traditional Indian vegetarian desirable foods
so that's certainly not coming from Bon, but from India..,

Also seems to be a tangible relation between elaborate sang offerings like Riwo Sang Cho with many precious substances in the ingredients and the homa offerings of vedic tradition.

Malcolm wrote:
One characteristic of rituals of Bon origin is that at the beginning of the rite there is a narrative of its origin. Look at ChNN's description of Sang on page 109 of Drung, Deu and Bon.

No one is denying Buddhist appropriation of some native Tibetan rites like Sang, but there is not even one single rite of Sang that was translated from Sanskrit to Tibetan. The Sang offering attributed to Padmasambhava was written in Tibet. Also this Sang offering shows evidence of having been converted from a Bonpo rite because like other Bonpo rites and Sang, it contains a narrative of its origin.

Offering of incense as a object of scent and Sang, which is used for purification, have totally different functions. In ancient Tibetan culture, nomads would have newcomers to their camp pass through Sang smoke to prevent contagious diseases. They mainly used juniper, but also many other aromatic plants as well. The principle of Sang and the principle of smudging in Native American cultures is very similar.

Riwo Sangchod, incidentally, it not a terma, it is a dag snang, a pure vision.

A: "When we discuss what constitutes a precious human birth, having all sense faculties intact is one of the requirements."

This is unclear and confusing. Surely it is not meant that the deaf cannot learn the Dharma because they cannot  hear the Dharma. Would the Dharma be then dependent on sound waves vibrating air which in turn vibrates the inner ear? Is it a requirement that one not be blind or deaf to be considered human?

Malcolm wrote:
You should acquaint yourself with the eight freedoms and ten favorable conditions that constitute a precious human birth, not just any old human birth.

With respect to having complete sense organs intact, if one does not, for example, it makes one unsuitable to be a Vajrayāna practitioner.

With respect to studying common Dharma, in ancient times blind people were less at a disadvantage than the deaf. These days the people with sensory deficits are at less of a disadvantage because of modern technology, but I wager there are very few blind people who participate on the forum.

To answer Dzogchungpa's question, the main criteria is organs of sight and hearing.

To answer Garuda Vista's question, in Dzogchen there are techniques for blind people.

But in general we have to understand that precious human birth has very precise criteria which indicates the ease with which one may meet and study Dharma.

importance of learning the Dharma from a capable teacher.

Astus said:
Who counts as a capable teacher depends on whom one likes. Thus both the best and the worst can gather a large community where both call the other incompetent. How to tell which one is correct? That's when one has to start learning from the Buddha himself by reading his words. And if that's not enough, there are numerous traditionally approved masters, like Nagarjuna, Aryadeva, Asanga and Vasubandhu to consult with. And if even that's not enough, there are quite a few generally reliable works by modern teachers, like the Dalai Lama, Thrangu Rinpoche, Thich Nhat Hanh, Hsing Yun, Sheng Yen, etc.

DGA said:
Buddha Dharma is described as an oral tradition to the present, even with all these texts available.

Astus said:
By whom? There are teachers, true. But hardly any of them could recite even just a few major Mahayana sutras, not to mention the whole canon of the Buddha's words. Buddhism has been a scriptural tradition for over two millennia. It doesn't mean there are no explanations give orally, on the spot. But even the most important commentaries are textual.

Thank you for that clear explanation. I do have two follow-on questions.

If, for some reason, the student was not whole heartedly present, and wasn't able to experience something, is it possible to gain direct experience without receiving another pointing out instruction from the master again at a later date?

Specifically, I'm thinking of practice texts such as Pointing Out the Dharmakaya, Clarifying the Natural State, or The Ocean of Definitive Meaning. One reads those texts, not for conceptual understanding (although that may happen), but as tools for working with experience. In your opinion, is it possible to have a successful pointing out by working with those texts (with the blessing of the guru of course)?

Malcolm wrote:
The principle of these mahāmudra texts is completely different and much more gradual. If you read these books and work with them without a teacher, it is possible you can have a sutra-like experience of śamatha and vipaśyāna, you can even become a first stage bodhisattva, but that does not mean you will have discovered the rig pa that Dzogchen is talking about. Of course, if you work with a realized master it is possible you can have that experience.

They are like fleeting images of the moon in the sky mirrored on the surface of the water held in vessels of varying sizes. The wise men and scholars of the various schools are first of all confused as to [the nature of the Buddhas of] their own school, and more fundamentally, they are ignorant of [the Buddha of] the “Life Span” chapter of the Lotus Sutra.

anjali said:
If one has received the pointing out instructions, but didn't "get it" at the time, is it possible in your opinion to later "get it" while reading a text?

Malcolm wrote:
If one has received direct introduction, it is possible that you may understand something more clearly with such a text, but since direct introduction works with experiences, there is no way one can substitute this conceptual understanding for working with the transmission by means of working with various experiences until one discovers the basis, aka primordial state, for oneself and has stabilizes that knowledge [rig pa].

The reason? Direct introduction works with experiences to show what the foundation that lies below experiences, thoughts and concepts, i.e. the mind essence. This is extremely subtle and cannot be discovered merely through reading books, no matter how holy or profound. The error, quite frankly, is mistaking the fact that we are aware with that awareness being the mind essence itself. The awareness that we experience moment to moment is quite coarse, and is dominated by our "energy," our rlung or vāyu. The mind essence is much more subtle than any awareness we can experience.

Direct introduction, received from a master who knows what it is he is introducing, is indispensable — it sets up the foundation for our later discovery of our own state even if at the time the experience was too subtle for us to register it clearly. Anytime anyone participates in a direct introduction with a realized master in a whole hearted openly collaborative way [rather than passively expecting something to happen], they will in fact experience that moment of knowledge [rig pa] the master intends to introduce. Even if they do not "grasp" it at the time, they will have that experience to carry with them. In the beginning, our concepts are very strong, and our ability to see the mind essence is very weak. Therefore, our moment of rig pa we experience in the direct introduction is something like a small branch caught up in a torrent of a river of concepts — it is very easily swept away. But if we are patient, and we are diligent, we can again have that experience of the mind essence, upon which all future practice depends. Why? Because it was introduced and we had it once. There is nothing at all mystical about the process, it is straightforward and nonmagical.

The process of reading is too conceptual, the mind involved is too coarse, and therefore, it is impossible that we can experience the mind essence from reading a text. However, if we have experienced the mind essence reading books such as the Chos dbying mdzod and so on can reinforce our confidence which we can bring to our practice.

In order to experience the mind essence we have to cut through coarse concepts with various methods to re-experience the mind essence that we were exposed to during the introduction. This is why we have practices such as rushen and semszin, and supremely, Song of the Vajra.

For a Direct Introduction to the Nature of your Mind, please read, "Self-Liberation Through Seeing With Naked Awareness," by Guru Padmasambhava, translated by John Reynolds. It is available on your Kindle or in print.

This not a direct introduction. One cannot receive direct introduction from a book.
I understand what you are saying. But I would not consider ancient texts formerly "Sealed, Sealed, Sealed," to be in the category of books. Many of these are in fact "Direct Oral Instructions" that in fact Dzogchen students of the past had no access to without a lung. And then, perhaps only one of these was read to them, one or a few times.

You have to understand the extraordinary times we live in. I have many secret texts along with explanations given by masters. Instead of hearing just a few of them a limited number of times, I can internalize these sacred texts dependent upon the extent of my devotion. Reading, studying, and internalizing these ancient original formerly secret texts are every bit as effective as hearing them. One can be liberated in this manner. As a lifetime student of religion, I fully appreciate the extraordinary development of having access to material that I would have had to travel to Tibet in hopes of finding when I first began to study religion.

I am not talking about reading books "about Dzogchen" with their conversational descriptions. I am talking about original pith instructions which can put one in the state of Intrinsic Awareness, one's Primordial State, simply by reading them, if one is receptive. You have to have lived long enough to fully understand the extraordinary nature of this development in the history of religion.

Malcolm wrote:
Look, I think we are talking about two entirely different things. Someone who reads Dzogchen texts without having had the benefit of a real transmission and explanation cannot receive transmission even from the most profound writing of ancient upadeshas written on a page. They might find them inspiring, but they won't discover anything and they will just remain in a state of concepts.

This is quite different than finding inspiration in those same instructions that have been communicated to you by a qualified teacher.

steve_bakr said:
I fully endorse having a personal teacher, most definitely. It is the nature of these texts, however, that listening to your teacher does not transmit the complete sentence by sentence density of the line by line liberating pith teachings contained in these secret texts. Much of what teachers present is the background understanding and preparation necessary to understand what is contained in these texts. A teacher will also judge your personal capabilities, and intsruct you accordingly. There are three kinds of students: the superior, the intermediate, and the inferior.

Malcolm wrote:
What the teacher communicates is the essence of those instructions. That living relationship with a master enlivens those instructions because the instructions are then connected with transmission. Without transmission, the instructions have no life.

Students of Buddhadharma in the west may need to be as robust in the discussion of these issues ( the authenticity or otherwise of specific teachers ) as they are vis-a-vis climate change or capitalism, without that being seen as somehow adharmic.


Malcolm wrote:
Generally speaking, the discussion of the validity of teachers is best done without calling people out by name. It is best to describe the positions they hold and identify those as problematical.

On the other hand, when someone makes themselves a celebrity, they are inviting inspection and criticism.

Paul, yes, I genuinely think that this is a bad idea too. I know how controversial this sounds, but it is actually the same karmic situation I outlined and no criticism could be helpful. My capacity for explaining such complex topics is not that high, and seeing how easy my words are misinterpreted here I would not even try to elaborate further. But I think that there is only one thing which is truly helpful in dealing with cult leaders and harmful teachers - presenting a strong example of a genuine path. This is the only way out and the only true help we can give. Everything else will destroy us in the end, no matter how good the initial intentions are. I believe this is also, incidentally, in harmony with the precepts of the Buddadharma.
I have to disagree completely then. Warning someone away from a cult is never a bad thing, as the cult cannot lead to liberation. Certainly when it starts to involve tantra and samaya issues. A group like that, and as I mention there is a rather active and highly negative cult here in the UK, is worse than poison. Poison can only harm you in one life.

I'm honestly not sure that you're saying this, but allowing someone to go down a harmful path because 'it's their karma' in some way is not compassionate.

Malcolm wrote:
People are free, and it is not our job to condition anyone to follow any path at all, whether we think it is a good one or not.

That said, there is nothing wrong with providing facts — for example, Jax's comments on facebook are there for all to see.

Providing info is one thing, strongly conditioning others is another. If someone wants to worship the Gyalpo, this may be a pity, but it is not our job to try and force them or convert them from that path. All we can do is point out what masters such as HHDL, ChNN and so on say about it. If they want to listen, fine, if not, then fine.

I don't think that it is arguable to say there is unanimity of opinion on this.

HHDL " Dzogchen: Heart Essence of the Great Perfection ": Question: Certain Nyingma masters have expounded shentong- emptiness of other-as the view of Dzogchen. Do you agree with them? Why is shentong such a controversial view among Tibetan Buddhist philosophers?

HHDL: If we read the writings of the great scholar Mipham, especially his commentary on the Sublime Continuum, we find that he explicitly mentions the importance of understanding the Dzogchen view, in which one is able to combine the teachings of emptiness, as expounded in the wisdom sütras of the second turning of the wheel of Dharma, with the sütras belonging to the third turning of the wheel of Dharma, particularly the Essence of Buddhahood Sutra. The understanding developed through a combination of the views expounded in both turnings of the wheel of Dharma will enable us to appreciate what in Dzogchen terminology are called: primordial purity, which is the main subject matter of the second turning, and spontaneous presence, which is the main subject matter of the third turning of the wheel of Dharma.

However, this does not mean that the emptiness spoken of in the second turning, that is in the wisdom sütras, is exactly the same as what in Dzogchen terminology is called primordial purity. But one thing which is clear is that without an understanding of emptiness as expounded in the wisdom sutras, and without taking that understanding as a basis, there is no way that you can understand primordial purity in the context of Dzogchen.

As for the question of whether spontaneous presence in Dzogchen is synonymous with what is called the tathagatagarbha- the essence of buddhahood or innate mind of clear light-in the third turning of the wheel of Dharma, especially in the Essence of Buddhahood Sutra, there do seem to be divergent views on that, even among Nyingma meditators and scholars.

Malcolm wrote:
Because you don't understand Dzogchen, you really can't appreciate what HHDL is saying here.

1) There is the question of whether it is really proper to try an understand Dzogchen on the basis of sūtra. I personally question the entire context of HHDL's comments. Dzogchen is not part of the three turnings, not at all.

2) The main controversy HHDL mentions is whether is proper to consider tathāgatagarbha as presented in sūtra to be the same as lhun grub or not.

This is just not the same thing as conflating Yogacara and Dzogchen. Tathāgatagarbha has a very subordinate role in Yogacara. It is almost entirely ignored.

Malcolm wrote:
That's an interesting question. Even if the bliss associated with full awakening is deeper than mere liberation, it is not a great degree of liberation, but rather, a quality associated with the result of the path.

There are basically five paths and ten stages. Paths measure realizations, stages measure qualities. There are also four kinds of realized persons, which are in fact measures of liberation from latent afflictions. The measure of full liberation is an arhat, pratyekabuddha, or an eighth stage bodhisattva, because only arhats, pratyekabuddhas and eighth stage bodhisattvas on up are free from birth in the three realms. However, the difference between the former two and the latter are the qualities cultivated on the path and the depth of realization. Arhats and pratyekabuddhas do not necessarily realize the emptiness of phenomena, and they do not necessarily comprehend the nonarising of phenomena.

In that respect, just as a rishi possesses the five clairvoyances and a pure eye, in the same way bodhisattvas generate bodhicitta, and after they attain patience for the nonarising of phenomena, it is observed that they attain the full perfect buddhahood of unsurpassed perfect complete awakening.
One who does not attain any phenomena, where is nirvana for one such as he? The Tathāgatas introduce them to awakening, and having generated bodhicitta, they do not abide in samsara and they also do not attain nirvana.
Son of a good family, a women who possesses four qualities should take this Saddharmapundarika in hand. If it is asked what four, they are as follows: being blessed by the Buddha Bhagavans, having generated roots of virtue, abiding in the heap of certainties and having generated the thought of unsurpassed perfect full awakening in order to protect all sentient beings.

In achieving this, the buddhas have achieved a nature that is of complete purity. Thus, [to actualize] the suchness that is the unmistaken way things are is to be “the self of great beings.” This self is not the same as the conceived object that is involved when apprehending the twofold self because such a self has no bearing on things as they are.

Nirvana Sutra
Chapter Six: On the Virtue of the Name

V199.   “Then the Tathagata spoke again to Kasyapa: “O good man! You should now uphold all the words, chapters, clauses and all the virtues thereof of this sutra. Any good man or woman who hears the name of this sutra will never get born into the four realms [of hell, hungry ghost, animal, and asura]. Why not? I shall now expound to you all the virtues of this sutra and all that is practised by innumerable boundless Buddhas.”

V200.   Bodhisattva Kasyapa said to the Buddha: “O World-Honoured One! What is this sutra to be called? How should Bodhisattva-mahasattvas uphold this sutra?” The Buddha said to Kasyapa: “The name of this sutra is to be “Mahaparinirvana”. The foremost word betokens “good”, the middle also “good”, and the final “good” too. The signification [of this sutra] is extremely deep, and what is written [in it] is good. The pureness of its arrangement is perfect, its action is pure, and its adamantine treasure-house is all-satisfying. Listen well, listen well! I shall now speak. O good man! The word “maha” betokens “eternal”. This is like all the great rivers draining into the great ocean. The same with this sutra. It crushes out all the bonds of illusion and all the qualities of Mara, and then body and life drain into “Mahaparinirvana”. Hence we say “Mahaparinirvana.” O good man! This is like a doctor who has a secret treatment embracing all medical treatments for disease. O good man! It is the same with the Tathagata. V201.   All the various wonderful doctrines taught and all the secret(esoteric) depths of meaning find their way into this Mahaparinirvana. That is why we say Mahaparinirvana. O good man! It is like a farmer who sows seed in spring. He entertains a rare wish. When he has finished the harvesting, all his longing is at an end. O good man! The same is the case with all beings. If we study other sutras, we always long for beautiful tastes. When one once hears this Mahaparinirvana, [however], one long ceases to covet the beautiful tastes mentioned in other sutras. This great Nirvana well enables all beings to cross the sea of all existences. O good man! Of all footprints, that of the elephant is the best. The same with this sutra. Of all the samadhis of the sutras, that of this sutra is the best. O good man! Of all the tillings of the field, that done in autumn is best.
V202.   The same with this sutra. It is the best of all sutras. It is like sarpirmanda, which is the best of all medicines. It thoroughly cures the feverish worries and madding minds of beings. This Great Nirvana is the foremost of all. O good man! It is like sweet butter which contains the eight tastes. The same also applies to this sutra. It contains the eight tastes. What are the eight? These are: 1) it is eternal, 2) it always is, 3) it is peaceful, 4) it is pure and cool, 5) it does not grow old, 6) it does not die, 7) it is taintless, and 8) it is pleasing and happy. These are the eight tastes. It possesses these eight tastes. This is why we say “Mahaparinirvana”. Now, all Bodhisattva-mahasattvas peacefully abide in this and manifest Nirvana in all places. That is why we say “Mahaparinirvna”. O Kasyapa! All good men and women who desire to enter Nirvana by this Mahaparinirvana must study well the fact that the Tathagata is eternal and that the Dharma and Sangha are eternal.”

V203.   Bodhisattva Kasyapa said to the Buddha: “All is wonderful, O World-Honoured One! We cannot conceive of the Tathagata’s depths of virtue. The same is the case with the virtues of Dharma and Sangha. This Mahaparinirvana is also inconceivable. One who studies this sutra will gain the right eye of Dharma and become a good doctor. Anybody who has not studied this sutra, we should know, is [like] a blind person, not possessing the eye of Wisdom and overshadowed by ignorance.”

Okay but the text literally says that their extinction (of their afflictions) is not real; it doesn't say that what they really need is omniscience. Imho your refusal to admit of any ambiguity anywhere can be a hindrance. Or are you saying that the thousands and thousands of words of Buddhadharma are inerrant, like the bible?

Anyway I won't argue the point. For me it's a distinction without a difference, since no one is disputing what the actual differences between a shravaka and Buddha are.

Stacks up? So you're standing in judgement? But I'm sure you must not mean that.

But really Malcolm you know I've been an open book on this, indiscriminately disclosing in numerous places, verbosely, to the annoyance of not a few!

So I would toss this question back to others, who have not been forthcoming on what liberation means to them, though asked to on occasion.

For your part, I accept your recent dzogchen pointers, which as you know I had no particular objection to.

But look, when it comes to giving brief conventional pointers to what liberation means in one's particular case, the easiest shorthand is to find a reference point in the broad tradition, as you have done.

So to repeat briefly what I've already disclosed elsewhere my view can be summed up in that hoary old Ch'an adage, which goes something like: in the beginning mountains are mountains and rivers are rivers, then mountains are not mountains and rivers are not rivers, finally mountains are mountains and rivers are rivers. Of course this is merely the figurative version of the grammar of the Diamond Sutra: is, is not and therefore is.

So again as I've said elsewhere liberation for me can only be a liberation into the no-place of what's here, a letting go, a relinquishment into the only place possible. Now how that is realized or thought about, as sudden or gradual, innate or constructed, through rigorous training or shouting at the moon, through the dancing angels of logical disputation or the sudden plosh! of a duck landing on a pond, through visualizing herukas or other celestial beings or astral traveling - I'll leave for other worthies and dharma warriors to battle over.

But you others, you silent ones! What does liberation mean to you? Speak!

Malcolm wrote:
In Buddhadharma, liberation means only one thing and nothing more no matter whether we are talking about Hinayāna, Mahāyāna or Vajrayāna, including Dzogchen — liberation means freedom from afflictions that cause rebirth in the three realms and that is all.

When the quote says the perfected nature does not exist, it clarifies that statement by saying that it does not exists IN THE SAME WAY of the forders understanding  which is the existence imputed upon the phenomena and persons(known as the 2 selves of the forders), so all you quote is actally saying is that it doesn't exist in ONE manner, BUT it exists in ANOTHER manner hence: " It is also not a nonentity, because at that time suchness, the characteristic of the perfected exists", of course the very terms Existence and Non Existence are words used to describe an Samsaric understanding and Suchness is beyond samasaric understanding. hence the non duality teachings (freedom from existence and nonexistence)

Malcolm wrote:
It is saying two things, it does not exist as a nature [svabhāva], but it exists as a svalakśana, a characteristic. For example, space does not exist as a nature [since there is no entity of space], but it does exist as a characteristic [since the characteristic of space is absence of obstruction.


Son of Buddha said:
It does exist however as a characteristic, and what is that characteristics, emptiness a.k.a suchness,

Vasubandhu also said:

Vasubandhu on the Sutralamkara 9:23, Thurman translation:
23. In pure voidness buddhas achieve the supreme self of selflessness, and realize the spiritual greatness of the self by discovering the pure self.

Yes, and here,


As you can see the Buddha and other Buddhist masters distinguished different types of Atman, rejecting most form's but accepting their own interpretation of the term Atman.

Malcolm wrote:
Again, this is intentional language and is not to be taken literally. For example, in the comment on this passage {which is by Maitreya and not Vasubandhu], Sthiramati's Sūtrālaṃkāravṛttibhāṣya provides useful clarification here:
The term "self" in this context means "essence" [svabhāvatā], i.e., since the buddhas are are said to obtain the supreme self because of being the selfless essence. Since that is pure, the buddhas attain the pure supreme selfless self.
He continues in this vein:
The Buddha is the dharmakāya. Since the dharmakāya is emptiness, because there are not only no imputable personal entities in emptiness, there are also no imputable phenomenal entities, there are therefore no entities at all.
Now, someone may wish to counter "Sure, the imputed nature does not exist, but the perfect nature does exist," but Sthiramati responds to this:
The nature of the perfected does not exist. Since it does not exist in the same way the horn the hare of the imputed phenomena and persons, at that it is not defined as existent. It is also not a nonentity, because at that time suchness, the characteristic of the perfected exists.
This means that the perfected is not a substantial entity. It does exist however as a characteristic, and what is that characteristics, emptiness a.k.a suchness, which is not a self in any sense in which the word is used as an identifier, unless of course one wishes to claim, "The supreme identity is no identity" or "The supreme self is no self." This is precisely the meaning here. What this means is that this "self" is merely a designation and does not indicate anything real, any more than conventionally calling the stream of the aggregates a self does not indicate anything real.


Now, Sthiramati was a direct disciple of Vasubandhu, and I am quite sure he understands this text perfectly.


Son of Buddha said:
Consistent with this remark by Vasubandhu we see the Buddha using the term atman to refer to himself, and so on as a mere designation, etc. He never uses it to refer to a real entity, not even in the much vaunted Nirvana Sūtra.
In the very much vaunted Nirvana Sutra the Buddha does describe the Atman as real, he literally tells you the meaning of the term of Atman and says that it is real.

Malcolm wrote:
No, in the Nirvana Sutra, the Buddha is using intentional language that cannot be taken literally.

What you are promoting is called the 4 perversions of the dharma, to think full enlightenment is not self is the 3rd perversion.


The Self’ signifies the Buddha; ‘the Eternal’ signifies the Dharmakaya; ‘Bliss’ signifies Nirvana, and ‘the Pure’ signifies Dharma. Bhiksus, why is it said that one who has the idea of a Self is arrogant and haughty, traversing round Samsara? Bhiksus, although you might say, ‘We also cultivate impermanence, suffering, and non-Self, these three kinds of cultivation have no real value/ meaning. I shall now explain the excellent three ways of cultivating Dharma. To think of suffering as Bliss and to think of Bliss as suffering, is perverse Dharma; to think of the impermanent as the Eternal and to think of the Eternal as impermanent is perverse Dharma; to think of the non-Self [anatman]as the Self [atman] and to think of the Self [atman] as non-Self [anatman] is perverse Dharma; t o think of the impure as the Pure and to think of the Pure as impure is perverse Dharma. Whoever has these four kinds of perversion, that person does not know the correct cultivation of dharmas.
V119.   These are called perversions/ inversions. Because of these perversions/ inversions, mundane people know the letters but not the meaning [referents]. What is the meaning/referent? Non-Self is Samsara, the Self is the Tathagata; impermanence is the sravakas and pratyekabuddhas, the Eternal is the Tathagata’s Dharmakaya; suffering is all tirthikas, Bliss is Nirvana; the impure is all compounded [samskrta] dharmas , the Pure is the true Dharma that the Buddha and Bodhisattvas have. This is called non-perversion/ non-inversion. By not being inverted [in one’s views], one will know [both] the letter and the meaning. If one desires to be freed from the four perverse/ inverted [views – catur-viparita-drsti], one should know the Eternal, Blissful, the Self and the Pure in this manner.”

Multiply the four varieties of self by their three modes, and you have twelve types of theories about the self. All of these theories the Buddha rejects. He doesn't agree with any of them, because they all involve clinging, which is something you have to comprehend and let go. This means that his not-self teaching is not just negating specific types of self — such as a cosmic self, a permanent self, or an ordinary individual self. It negates every imaginable way of defining the self.

All Buddhas and all creatures are nothing but one citta. Besides this citta. nothing exsist. The citta which has no beginning does not appear and can not be destroyed. It is not something green or yellow. It has no shape nor appearances. It is not included in the existence or the none existence. It cannot be considered new or old, long or short, big or small because it is beyond all limitation measurement, nomination trace and comparison.

My understanding is that when in a state of wisdom with regards to the nature of the basis, all phenomena are of 'one taste'. Why then does the energy of the basis manifest as compassion when it is aware of its own nature?

The basis manifests as compassion, i.e., nirmanakāya buddhas, when a sentient being does not recognize the basis for what it is, his, her or its own nature.

Man, brutal. You just insulted someone that was widely considered an Arahant in Thailand based on your interpretation of a Sutta. The Citta as described in the Thai forest tradition is not a consciousness, therefore this sutta is rendered useless in an argument against it. Ajahn Martin specifically says consciousness is a part of the khandas and not eternal. The eternal Citta is independent of the khandas

From Ajahn Pannavaddhos biography uncommon wisdom - Consciousness is necessary to experience the duality of subject
and object, but it is completely extraneous and unnecessary to the
original citta. So from the point of view of the reality of the knowingness
which is the true citta, consciousness is superfluous because the
true knowing is always present in the citta, even after all the physical
and mental aggregates have disappeared.

So here you see he is referring to consciousness and the citta as two different things. Further proof the sutta is irrelevant to it. Ajahn Maha Bua was a scholar before he became a hardcore meditator under Ajahn Mun. Don't you think he knows what the pali canon says? And Ajahn Thanissaro is a follower of Ajahn Maha Bua's eternal citta. And Ajahn Thanissaro is responsible for a lot of the suttas translations into english, maybe even including the one you sent me!
Luangta Maha Bua called the citta the eternal tourist who goes from life to life. In this case, it is the conventional citta. It would not be wrong to call it a soul or to speak of souls.

As for the Madhyamaka view you're referencing here it's a wholly separate issue, but I would say that an analysis that dissolves the difference between cause and effect seems to me to be at the very least the beginnings of establishing a view from the ultimate side.

But untangling the two truths at any given moment is a delicate thing and easily leads to needless debate. I would favor us both taking the charitable view and assume the correctness of what the other is saying, in the context in which he is saying it.

Malcolm wrote:
Nāgārjuna begins the MMK with this famous verse:
At no time and no where 
does anything arise
from itself, from other, 
from both or without a cause.
Nāgārjuna's presentation does not dissolve the difference between cause and effect, it states that one cannot coherently designate causes and effects as being either the same or different without the following flaws.

For example, the Samkhya school maintains that effects are present in their causes, violating Nāgārjuna first maxim, "no arising from itself"; the Vaiśeṣika school maintains that causes and results are utterly distinct, violating Nāgārjuna;s second maxim, "no arising from other." The third maxim, "no arising from both" is present merely for formal completeness — I know of no Indian school that proposes both.

The consequence of the first assertion is that arising is unnecessary and there is can only be homogenous reproduction of the series[ thus proposing that existents arise from existents].  The consequence of the second assertion is that there is arising of an existent result from a cause that has already temporally perished, [thus proposing that existents arise from nonexistents.] The consequence of the third assertion involves the faults of the first two assertions.

Nāgārjuna, and all subsequent Madhyamikas, maintain conventionally that causes are neither the same nor different form their effects in order to account for causal continuity without invoking either identity or discontinuity, thus Nāgārjuna's fourth maxim, "There is no arising without a cause," is never violated at any time.

Of course, later, Nāgārjuna shows that ultimately arising is impossible:
An existent does not arise from existent, 
an existent does not arise from a nonexistent, 
an nonexistent does not arise from an existent,
a nonexistent does not arise from a nonexistent —
where then is there arising?

MalaBeads said:
Although i dont know how chan/zen was taught or practiced in Hashang's time, i would definitely say this is true today. I remember reading ChNN's small book called "Dzogchen and Zen" and thinking that it did not correspond at all to how the practice was done at SFZC. Then, many years later, I heard ChNN speak of Suzuki-roshi as a vajrayana teacher.

I never met Suzuki-roshi so I don't know how he taught but I have heard some of his students say that Suzuki-roshi himself described his teaching as "Hinayana teaching with Mahayana spirit". Certainly, the precision of the forms was very Hinayana-like. And perhaps the Mahayana aspect goes without saying.

Then, a few years ago, one of Suzuki-roshi main lineage holders, Mel Weitzman, said that Suzuki-roshi had not taught them some of the more advanced practices in the lineage (at least thats how I understood what I heard him say). So there does seem to be an evolution of sorts happening in zen teaching in america. And of course, I am speaking of only one lineage in a vast and complicated school.

Honestly, I don't concern myself too much with what I consider to be ancient history (although I know that for some it is important and indeed can be a life's work). Nevertheless, I very much value what zen taught me, especially the form aspect.

Malcolm wrote:
The kind of Chan ChNN is talking about is the kind of Chan that once existed in Tibet and no longer does. It was discussed at length by Nubchen.

ChNN said that modern Chan/Zen is very influenced by Vajrayāna. There is someone who posts here occasionally, Matilda, who comes from a traditional Soto Temple family. According to her, the senior Soto Priests in Japan preserve a set of empowerments and practices in which they alone engage. It seems that the Soto school has not shared everything of their tradition with westerners so far.

In Dzogchen, the term bdag nyid chen po and bdag nyid accompanies the terms ngang and rang bzhin. This true in both Buddhist and Bon texts.

For example, in the Zhang Zhung sNyan rGyud, we find:
State [ngang], nature [rang bzhin] and identity [bdag nyid] are a trio.
The state is the total clarity of rig pa. 
The nature is the total emptiness of rig pa. 
The identity is the nonduality of clarity and emptiness.
Everything is understood as pure consummate mind [byang chub sems]
through the axiom of total identity [bdag nyid chen po].
I have many similar examples from Buddhist texts. So here, I would prefer to render this term as "total identity."

Malcolm wrote:
As I said, Dudjom, Kongtrul and I do not disagree. We understand these texts. But you do not, and so you are perpetually confused as to what they mean because you just read the words without understanding the meaning and so you imagine contradictions where in fact none exist.

And you keep on attributing a dimension of time to a state where there is no time. Dzogchen texts talk about the fourth time. That is the time of the basis, i.e. no past, present, future. Hence use of the terms like original, primordial, and so on. The basis is one's own unfabricated mind —— it is not a buddha, it is not a sentient being, it is beyond time, beyond extremes, beyond expression, it has never been liberated because it has never experienced a state of bondage and so on. Accumulating merit and wisdom will not liberate it; engaging in the five heinous misdeeds [harming a buddha, killing an arhat, etc.] will not place it in bondage. There is nothing you can to improve it, nothing you can do will harm it. It is empty, clear and inseparable. Relatively, when it is not recognized, it is called "the basis appears as the universe." At the time it is recognized, it is called "The universe arises as the basis." The basis is the basis, it is the path and it is the result. There is no buddhahood to find outside of the basis, likewise, there is no buddhahood to find outside of one's own unfabricated mind. One'w unfabricated mind is buddhahood. There is no other buddhahood to realize. Everything is complete within that unfabricated mind, all of samsara and nirvana is complete there. And there are also no phenomena of either samsara or nirvana at all present in the basis.



So obviously Kongtrul has a different take on it. You may disagree, as is your right, but if you push it you're basically calling him a tirthika.[/quote]

No, actually it is specifically and deliberately being presented as a "ground of being". "Myriad Worlds" is about the various cosmologies, starting with Mr Meru and such.

Excluding the presence of either buddhas or sentient beings makes that clear.

Hey, you don't have to buy it. Plenty of people have become enlightened that find such ideas heresy. But plenty of people, such as Kongtrul himself presumably, have become enlightened while holding those types of ideas. So either way is fine. It is a matter of preference.

No, SMCJ, the term in Tibetan is simple gzhi, basis. There is no connotation of being presented by use of the term gzhi. In fact the gzhi, the basis is devoid of any extreme of existence, nonexistence and so on. The basis is ka dag, originally pure, i.e. empty, as Master Vimalamitra states:
The basis, the state of initial original purity, is liberated
because its essence is not established at all.
"Ground of being" is a term coined by the theologian Paul Tillich to describe God. The basis is not a creative force like God. It does not generate anything. Nothing arises from the basis, and nothing returns to the basis. The Six Dimension offers some clarity:
Dharmatā free from proliferation is originally pure;
it is the basis of an intrinsically pure nature;
it is free from words and syllables;
it cannot be confirmed through expression;
it is free from all conventional reification;
it is without concepts of apprehended objects and apprehending
subjects;
it is without buddhas and without sentient beings;
it is without phenomena and without perception of phenomena;
no one, no thing, nothing at all.
When the essence of such nonexistence
is confirmed with some words:
the essence is original purity
and the nature is natural perfection.

The living experience of reality is joy beyond joy, limitless love, all-embracing compassion, intrinsic awareness, and omniscience.

Malcolm wrote:
The 12th century Tibetan Great Perfection master Rongzom anticipates this:
To determine the greatness of the total non-existence of buddhahood, if buddhahood and non-buddhahood [108/a] are nondual, why is one seeking? Determine there is nothing to seek. The yogins in whom such a meaning is present effortlessly abide on the undifferentiated stage of Samantabhadra. The undifferentiated stage of Samantabhadra is universal stage of all Buddhas. Whatever the meaning of the Great Perfection might be, that is it.

“Joining my palms together in deepest respect, I appeal to you to consider that if there were no absolute reality, there could be no relative world. If there were no permanent, fully illumined state, consciousness could not exist at all. This is the state of the primordial Buddha, the Buddha who has always existed even before our human buddhas were born. This state is always fully present in each of us, but it is not available to those who argue philosophically; it is only available to the yoga practitioners who cleanse their minds in order to experience it directly.

Malcolm wrote:
Again, Mañjuśrimitra states:
Therefore, because awakening and non-awakening are the same in terms of absence of characteristics, there is nothing to accept or reject.
In accordance with the meaning of that, all those explanations 
of the nominal ultimate, the absence of arising and ceasing, sameness, 
nonduality, beyond thought, emptiness, the dharmadhātu, 
freedom from expression and convention, and so on are not ultimate and also are not relative.
If it is said, “This is the path in accordance with the ultimate,” that is relative.
Do not abandon or dwell in any Dharma at all, with or without doubt. 
Because the meditator and the dharmadhātu do not exist, there is nothing to doubt and there is no nothing to see as ultimate.

Hi Malcolm. Yes, understood, from the ultimate level.

But at issue with the Ajahn was his account of rebirth from what I would consider the conventional level, and my point was that his kind of reasoning was overly simple for the kind of learners he's likely to be confronted with. Lacking the resources of the Mahayana, let alone the Madhyamaka, it would seem to me better to at least be consistent with the notion of identity, and even better to bracket the whole area of the conventional self for which he can give no satisfactory answers.

Malcolm wrote:
The absence of identity and difference between cause and effect is on the conventional level, that is whole point. From an ultimate point of view, there is no sense in discussing the identity or difference of causes and results.

Son of Buddha said:
(1) by his definition the Buddha was an eternalist because the Buddha taught the 4 virtues of Nirvana(permanence,bliss,self,purity) in the Buddha Nature Sutra's.

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddha also taught that nirvana was not permanent and not impermanent and so on in other sūtras, still in others he taught nirvana was cessation, etc.

The point is that one cannot always take what the Buddha says in the sūtras literally.

One has to discern what is definitive and what is provisional. As far as the Tathāgatagarbha sutras go, there are two ways to understand them: a provisional way which causes one to be a kind of eternalist; and a definitive way which is free from the fault of the provisional approach and has no taint of attachment to dualities such as permanent, impermanent and so on.

Of course you will respond with the three turnings of the wheel interpretive scheme, but I have already shown elsewhere in detail that the Tibetan use of this schema finds no support at all in Indian literature, especially not with Maitreyanatha, Asanga, etc., and is in fact is the system of a Korean master who commented at length on the Samdhinirmocana-sūtra, whose commentary exists in the Tibetan canon and was very influential.

Vimalakirti432 said:
As an example let's look at a talk on rebirth by Ajahn Brahmali, which is available on YouTube. This is not to rag on the Ajahn, who overall gave a good presentation for learners. But in his attempt to cut off clinging to self he used the identity argument in such a way as to illustrate what I've been saying.

In short, he argued for the absolute discontinuity of consciousness, from one thought moment to the next, and so the incoherence of a continuous identity. Of course this just begged the question(s). As one young woman in the room asked, What thought moment is it that is cognizing this absolute discontinuity? His answer was evasive and weak, suggesting some kind of inference.

And even a moment's reflection reveals that yes I'm not the same as I was a moment ago, but I'm also not different. (And isn't this very same point made in the Surangama sutra, if memory serves?) But there's a more serious objection yet.

The doctrine of rebirth depends for its coherence on some notion of identity, as Bhikku Bodhi points out without controversy I think in his article on rebirth (again available online). So we have this peculiar consequence that we poor benighted sentient beings are only granted identity at the point of rebirth but not in our actual lives!

Malcolm wrote:
The Madhyamaka point of view is that causes and effects are neither the same nor are they different, thus avoiding all contradictions between absence of identity and continuity. Therefore, there is no need for the doctrine of rebirth to hinge on any kind of identity proposition in order for someone to maintain continuity in a series.

seeker242 said:
The Lankavatara Sutra, a very popular zen sutra, talks a lot about this sort of thing. But you really don't ever get a "completely forthright" description of it. But that's not a failure of the teachings, it's a failure of the nature of words and concepts to begin with.
Then Mahamati said: Again, Bhagavan, are words themselves the
highest reality? or is what is expressed in words the highest reality?

The Bhagavan replied: Mahamati, words are not the highest reality, nor
is what is expressed in words the highest reality. Why? Because the
highest reality is an exalted state of bliss, and as it cannot be entered
into by mere statements regarding it, words are not the highest reality.
Mahamati, the highest reality is to be attained by the inner realization of
noble wisdom; it is not a state of word-discrimination; therefore,
discrimination does not express the highest reality. And then, Mahamati,
words are subject to birth and destruction; they are unsteady, mutually
conditioning, and are produced by the law of causation. And again,
Mahamati, what is mutually conditioning and produced by the law of
causation cannot express the highest reality, because the indications
[pointing to the distinction between] self and not-self are non-existent.
Mahamati, words are these indications and do not express [the highest
reality].
One's true self is "unconditioned" and therefore cannot be accurately described by the conditioned.
That which is unconditioned goes beyond all idle reasonings. That which goes beyond
all idle reasonings, that is the Tathagata. Mahamati, this is the essence of
perfect enlightenment, this is the self-nature of Buddhahood which is
removed from all senses and measurements. So it is said:

79. That which is released from senses and measurements is neither an
effect nor a cause; it has nothing to do with knowledge and that which is
to be known; it is free from predicated and predicating.

80. There is something which is nowhere to be seen by anybody as the
Skandhas, causation, enlightenment; of that which is nowhere to be seen
by anybody, what description can we make?

81. It is not something made nor unmade, it is neither an effect nor a
cause, it is neither the Skandhas nor not-Skandhas, nor is it other than
the combination.

82. There is something that is not to be seen by the discrimination of its
being, nor is it to be known as nonexistent; such is the self-essence of all
things.
The Lankavatara Sutra is one of my favorites. Although, not exactly "completely forthright" in a sense. Although, depending on how you look at it, one could say it's about as completely forthright as you can get!

Do you think confusion about this arises due to the fact that "rig pa" as a Tibetan term can also mean plain old, everyday "knowing"?

In the case of stillness [gnas pa], occurrence [gyu ba] and noticing [rig pa], the word rigpa is used for noticing. Self-existing awareness [rang byung rig pa] is also called rigpa. The word is the same but the meaning is different. The difference between these two practices is as vast as the distance between sky and earth.

a result to accomplished is sought from a cause. 
Without a cause in the mind there has never been a result

Having used an example for worldly arising phenomena, 
perishing after arising cannot be termed production.
Since the self-originated beyond cause and result cannot be examined,

It's the four thoughts that turn the mind; it's the accumulations of prostrations and so on; and then there are specific practices associated with certain Dzogchen transmissions that are also called "ngondro."  If the subsequent teachings are in 2016, is there some expectation of one doing a lot of accumulation before parts two and three, or...?

I also don't know what Nyoshi means.

I'm sorry if all this is obvious in context; I'm an ignorant lout asking out of interest in Dzogchen but lacking in context or much knowledge at all about Bon.  Thanks.

Malcolm wrote:
It just means that in some of his A khrid teachings, you should have attended section one. Here, no need since it is the preliminary section.

Here Ngondro means Ngondro, as in refuge, bodhicitta, etc. The first five or so sections involve some Ngondro teachings up to guru yoga among meditation instructions as well.

I just had a good experience at Serenity Ridge in Virginia (they allow participants to camp it if they want, which is great--I slept in my truck).

I'm curious how these teachings are divided up into segments.  What does "part one" of the A-Khrid involve?  how many parts are there?

thanks

Malcolm wrote:
It is probably the A Khrid in fifteen sections — about 36 western pages. There are other instructions, the fifteen section A khrid in the version I have amounts to about 165 pages of instructions. There is also another earlier manual divided into eight or ten sections. It is about 135 pages all totaled.

I imagine, though I could not tell you for sure, that is is three sections divided by five sections. It has the usual subjects like confidence in the guru, bodhicitta, refuge and confession, mandala, supplication to the guru, etc.

So I imagine that first retreat focuses mainly on Ngondro, the second and third retreats focus mainly nature of mind, etc.

There is a kind of literature called sa dpyad, literally, "site analysis" that gives various indications and sometimes even diagrams like the following: mountain_types.jpg (15.07 KiB) Viewed 4052 times
This illustration, from left to right, shows mountains according to elemental typology: wood [ཤིང], fire [མེ], metal [ལྕགས] and water [ཆུ].

It is generally held that the science of sa dbyad comes from China. The above illustration is from a text from is called The Treasury of Jewels, Chinese Site Analysis [rgya nag dpyad nor bu'i gter mdzod]. There are also site examination texts from India, having to do with mandala construction, as well as the subject of Vastu śastra.

The dual influences of Chinese and Indian culture on these issues is demonstrated by Karma Chagme's short text on this subject. We can see here too Tibetan pre-Buddhist ideas about ancestors and so on in the way the term bla is used in this specific context. The first chapter of Karma Chagme's text states:
The accurate result of the relative site:
in general, all of the outer universe and inhabitants
have the nature of the five elements. 
India, China, Mongolia and Tibet
are based on the way earth element has formed. 

The chronicle of happiness, suffering, 
increase and decrease, wealth and poverty
is clarified in the site examination texts of Kīlaya. 
Therefore, this location of the living, 
such as location of the house and so on, is important. 

Life [srog], the soul [bla] and consciousness [rnam shes] are a trio. 
Life is taken by the ghostly butcher.
Consciousness is the slave of karma.
Having taken the form of the past life, the soul
exists in the tomb site.  
If the tomb site is good, that soul prospers,
will protect and guard the living,
and is called "being guarded by the souls of the paternal ancestors."
If the tomb site is bad, that soul flounders,
and since it seeks protection in the living, 
the misfortune of unbearable illnesses arise. 
Therefore, the site of the tomb is important. 
It was said by Ārya Mañjusȓī
in the Tantras of the Divinatory Sciences of China,
"If the corpse is carried to a badly analyzed site,
even animals will be crushed into dust."
The text continues in the following chapter by listing various titles of Chinese and India site examination texts. Chapter three gives the general technique. Chapter four gives the techniques for picking a tomb site. Chapter five gives the specifics for picking a house site. Chapter six gives the specifics for selecting a site for practicing Chod.

FYI, the above text is a section of Karma Chagme's Mountain Dharma.

Much of this information about directions, shapes of the land and so on is to be found in elemental calculation, which is also part of the "Divinatory Sciences of China."

When you begin to delve into higher Buddhist tenets, the metaphor of space becomes more important, since emptiness is linked to it.

Introduction is a path. Once you have received introduction from a qualified person, then you apply it yourself. The only qualification one needs is interest.

In Dzogchen, it is sufficient to have an inferential understanding of emptiness, for example, derived from the eight examples of illusion.

The path itself does not necessarily involve any analytical vipaśyāna at all. It involves working with the experience of the introduction itself.

Dzogchen is not a path based on causes and results, as difficult as that is for many people to accept.

In the sūtrayāna path of dialectics the method of lung rig [scripture and reasoning* MS] is employed; that is, using the scriptural authority of the teaching of Buddha and the great masters, and through logic and reasoning, arriving at the realization of the view.

According to the common approach of Secret Mantrayāna, by means of the wisdom of example in the third empowerment, one is introduced to the real, ultimate wisdom in the fourth empowerment. 

Here, according to the special approach of the great masters of the practice lineage, the nature of mind, the face of rigpa, is introduced in and upon the very dissolution of conceptual mind.
Neither of the two latter methods require analysis, as I said, "Anyway, such analysis is not necessary in Dzogchen practice, not in any sense at all."
The crucial point here is that rigpa, which abides as the ground of dharmakāya, is the primordial purity of the path of the yogins, the absolute view of freedom from all elaboration. Until you recognize this one point, then whatever meditation or practice you do, you can never get beyond a fabricated mind-made view and meditation. The difference between this and the approach of the natural Dzogpachenpo is greater than that between earth and sky, as it does not possess the essential point—the unceasing flow of clear light, which is non-meditation. So it is most important, first of all, to recognize this and this alone, and: “Recognize this as the pure awareness of dharmakāya”.
I don't know why you bother citing Patrul Rinpoche, as he merely illustrates my point.

Astus said:
And the preceding sentence says: "as long as one does not directly experience the suchness (tattvam) of the selflessness of the personality and of dharmas, (there is) only a very intense zeal"

However, as shown in my previous collection of clarifying quotes, meditation is about direct perception, and through vipasyana  that is what is achieved. The zealous stage is about aspiring to that direct experience, it is the time of practice on the basis of the instructions, required before realisation is attained.

The text continues in the section on zealous conduct:

"But when one would ascertain the non-dual knowledge which is devoid of the forms of the object and subject, then this is the degree of penetration designated "The best (worldly) condition" (agradharma). And this is called "The samadhi without interval" because, in fact, immediately following it one enters into suchness."

Malcolm wrote:
The point is that you kept denying there was a conceptual meditation on suchness and thus, were quoting passages not in accordance with their meaning.

According to HHDL's commentary (p 141) it doesn't refer to some image but it's a synonym:

"Then once more continue your meditation on the union of special insight and calm abiding, which is also known as focusing on the reflection both conceptually and non-conceptually."

"Thus, through this progress, a yogi should meditate on suchness for an hour, or half a session in the night, or one full session, or for as long as is comfortable. This is the meditative stabilization thoroughly discerning the ultimate, as taught in the Descent into Lanka Sutra."

It is on suchness, not some image of suchness. And that's what is in the text in every place, directly seeing suchness, not simply an image or concept of it.

The quote provided in my previous post states: "apprehends the selfless nature of all phenomena", and that's the very result of the vipasyana. It would be quite pointless to achieve simply a generic concept, since for that there is no need to perform any meditation.

To wit: Instead of a single excluded middle between yes and no, we get the following middle grounds, most of which are chronically excluded and never mentioned:

Between yes and no
Between yes and (both yes and no)
Between yes and (neither yes nor no)

Kamalashila http://www.preciousteaching.org/sutra/kamalasilas-bhavana-krama-the-middle-meditation-stage/:

"What properly examines suchness from within a state of calm-abiding meditation is penetrative insight."

"When suchness is properly meditated upon with wisdom, purified transcendent wisdom is realised. Since wisdom alone can realise suchness and can effectively eradicate the obscurations, I shall therefore search for suchness through wisdom while engaging in calm-abiding meditation. And I shall not remain content with calm-abiding meditation alone.
What is suchness like? It is the nature of all phenomena that ultimately they are empty of the self of person and the self of phenomena. This is understood by the perfection of wisdom and not otherwise."

"What is thoroughly realised by the mind too is realised as being empty. By realising that, the very identity which is established as the aspect of the mind, like the identity of physical form, etc., is also not ultimately perceived. In this way, when a person does not ultimately see the identity of all phenomena through wisdom he would not analyse whether physical form is permanent or impermanent, empty or not empty, contaminated or non-contaminated, produced or non-produced and existent or non-existent.
Just as physical form is not examined, similarly feeling, recognition, compositional factors and consciousness are not examined. When the object does not exist, its particularities also cannot exist. So how can they be examined? In this way when the person does not firmly grasp on to the entity of a thing as ultimately existing, having investigated with wisdom, then the practitioner engages in a non-conceptual single-pointed concentration. And thus identitylessness of a11 phenomena is also realised."

"In this way one who has entered in the suchness of the selflessness of person and phenomena is free from concept and analysis because there is nothing to be thoroughly examined and observed. One is free from expression and with one-pointed mental engagement one automatically enters in meditation without manifest discrimination. Thus one very clearly meditates on suchness and abides in it."

"If and when the mind is spontaneously engaging in meditative equipoise on suchness free of sinking and mental agitation, at that time it should be left naturally and the efforts relaxed."

Malcolm wrote:
First Kamashila sets forth his objective. Then he describes the means he wants to use to get there.

This suchness is a generic image of suchness, it is not real suchness.

How so? That something is only a conventionally agreed name means that it has no basis beyond the concept.
That is not merely what conventional means. For example, according to one famous presentation of Madhyamaka, things are not non-existent in the relative. The term vyavahāra has come to mean a mere designation in some Buddhist circles, but even here, there are levels of vyavahāra, holding that this or that is vyavahāra does not mean that one is not also a realist. For example, "water" is vyavahāra, but its qualities of limpidity and wetness are parāmartha dharmas according to Sautrantikas. For example, according to one famous presentation of Madhyamaka, we cannot say a car is nonexistent, even though it is conventional, we can only say that there is no inherent car in a car, not that there is no car in that which is conventionally termed "a car" because such a thing has been designated on the basis of its parts. Why? Because that which is conventionally designated a car functions as a car, and hence it is car. According to this specific brand of Madhyamaka, a car has a basis beyond its concept, its parts. One cannot designate a bunch of sticks and leaves a car and expect to drive anywhere.

Well not all of them, not everywhere, but those Sherpas certainly are if you happen to find yourself climbing above 25,000 feet.

Recent genetic studies are looking at the mutations that allow Sherpas and other Tibetans to tolerate altitude easily, The weird part is one of the mutations causes Sherpas to make FEWER red blood cells. When a Westerner without the mutation is progressively exposed to higher altitudes, we make more blood cells to compensate. This process gets more and more extreme the higher we go, until in the death zone, we run into problems with blood viscosity which lead to High Altitude Pulmonary Edema and High Altitude Cerebral Edema, both life-threatening conditions.

Now the Sherpas don't do that. They make a pretty normal number of blood cells and avoid many problems, thanks to a mutation that seems to be less than 10,000 years old.

Another mutation looks like it is involved with oxygen metabolism. Maybe they don't pile up lactic acid via anaerobic metabolism to the extent we do. Maybe they can scavenge oxygen out of the blood stream better. No one knows yet but its an area of active research. This one is an older mutation.


There are quite a number of mutations that occur with roughly a 90% frequency among Tibetans, and some of them run as low a 1% frequency among Han Chinese. I find it really intriguing that we are so close to understanding the hows and whys of it all. A significant possibility is that it may be possible to develop an injection that will turn you into a Sherpa for a while.

How effective are these mutations? A few years back there was a massive problem on K2 and people were dropping like flies. If you enter the death zone, normally you have about 48 hours to get down before you become nonfunctional. That's a death sentence at altitude. A fellow name Pemba Gyalje Sherpa (sp?) began rescue operations, and by the time he was done he had spent 90 continuous hours in the death zone. Basket case right? Nope, when he was done he just hiked off the mountain. He was fine.

Of course it might be entirely due to Buddhist mental discipline and the help of Tara but somehow I don't think so...

I don't see why? You can experience something permanent but not always be in the right frame of mind to experience it. It is like perceiving background noise, you actually hear it only if you pay sufficient attention to it.

Astus said:
Permanence excludes causality. Being recognised is a change in conditions. Also, if it is one's permanent self, the self is the one that should recognise itself, and since it is permanent, it either always knows itself or never.

I guess this philosophy really isn't for me then... to me, whether you open or close your window to let the sunlight come in, won't change anything about the sun itself... but ok, doesn't matter, each to his own

Now while I do have a strong streak of rationalism - as do you, my new dharma buddy, the Venerable Malcolm - that's not my fundamental mental disposition - which is more properly labeled "pantheistic". For as long as I can remember I have had that well-attested sense of the aliveness of things, of trees and rocks as well as sentient beings, and no not just on sunny days. Of course this kind of feeling is tucked into or appropriated by most religious traditions where one can find its warrant. In the Gospel of Thomas, for example, where we find Jesus saying, "The kingdom of God is spread upon the Earth but men do not see it", and of course in many Zen sayings and Zen inspired poetry.

Now someone with this disposition may point to this and call it God or Brahmin and, while not necessarily being in error, may be adding a head to the one that's already there. That's why I've always been drawn to Buddhist dependent origination and the middle way as perhaps a more accurate and direct approach.

Of course I only speak for myself, but one with this disposition may experience, by moments at least, objects and beings, including one's own person, as a kind of transparency, as being particular instances of one energy, but a single energy that cannot be reified into some kind of literal "one".

Now just to be precise, I'm not calling myself a "pantheist"; I'm only copping to that disposition, and like all mental dispositions it's only the beginning to much that needs to be worked out and developed.

I could babble on of course, and  you know already what a terrible blabbermouth I am, but all this is to explain why I find it so weird to be called a "materialist", just because I find no evidence for or need to believe in particular theories about the nature of consciousness.

So you see I may well be an idiot, and maybe just as annoying as any other, but I thought it was of use to at least point out precisely what kind of idiot I am.

However, the knowledge obscuration is abandoned at the very end, at buddhahood, because it is more fundamental than the afflictive obscuration. Thus there is an non-afflictive ignorance that is the ignorance of which produces self-grasping, which even tenth stage bodhisattvas retain, and the afflictive ignorance which is the basis of taking birth in the three realms, abandoned on the seventh stage.

And again, the mind of analysis is a very coarse mind. That itself is a block for realization. For example, with our ordinary eyes we cannot see very subtle things. Likewise, with our ordinary conceptual minds we cannot realize what which is subtle and hard to realize. The best we can do is generate a coarse conceptual simulacrum. Then, in order to generate the subtle mind necessary for realizing the true nature of things, well, it takes a long time through sūtrayāna methods, many eons, just to even realize the first bhumi.

Astus said:
What defines coarse and subtle mind for you? No simulacrum is mentioned in the Bhavanakrama or other texts I'm aware of.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course there is, it is the conceptual emptiness meditated/cultivated during heat on the path of application.

Astus said:
Sure.
And what is reliable? Something one can grasp and hang on to?
Yes, just like people have convincing experiences of ropes as snakes.
Nobody sees snakes all the time, they at best think there is a permanent substance behind/within what they can experience in the six senses.

Malcolm wrote:
An experience of permanence is going to a place and seeing the same rock there, year in year out. Does not mean the rock is permanent, but it is the kind of thing that provides common people with their notion of permanence and durability.

Astus said:
Again, here is your claim that you have to begin with a position, only to abandon it later. This is like believing that in order to walk barefoot, one must first put on shoes and then take them off.
As noted before, people are already in the state of assuming positions and it is not adding another to point out the error.

Malcolm wrote:
No, actually they are not. A lot of Buddhist training involves planting ideas in people's heads that actually they don't hold.

Astus said:
And yet, again and again, so-called Madhyamikas make strenuous efforts to defend what they know is not true. This is the problem with Madhyamaka, again identified by Rongzom:
So, there are three things not understood: homogeneity (unity of the two truths), non-duality (unity not conceived as 1+1) and non-arising (lack of substance to come or go).

Malcolm wrote:
No, Madhyamikas understand nonarising [It is Yogacaras who do not], their problem is clinging to true relative truth.

Astus said:
Unless this is merely a critique of style and not content, but in that case it is an aesthetic question.

Malcolm wrote:
it is a critique of grasping in different systems, as already explained above.

to be more precise, knowledge obscurations arise from having had afflictive ignorance since beginingless time. like the smell of garlic in a wooden box, the smell has its origin with the garlic but persists after the garlic has been removed.

Malcolm wrote:
No, this is not the case. The knowledge obscuration precedes the afflictive obscuration, in other words, the latter arises from the former.


cloudburst said:
can you prove that? Im interested.

Patrul Rinpoche's The Vision of Clear Light is a practice text, not a classic? The Four Dharmas of Longchenpa?

Malcolm wrote:
Again, these books are commentaries by Rinpoche on specific texts, connected with ChNN's transmission for his students.

But Longchenpa's text of the four Dharmas has been openly published for decades now.
