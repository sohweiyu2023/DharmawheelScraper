All masters will tell you that the reality of Mahamudra and Dzogchen are identical. What is the difference between Mahamudra without a base of tantra and Dzogchen?

Method: mahamudra without tantra is just perfection of wisdom.

Method, ultimately, is the most important difference between sutra and tantra.

If you argue that the difference between mahāmudra and perfection of wisdom is guruyoga, I will just respond that guruyoga is a unique method of Annutarayoga tantra.

So it all boils down to method. Likewise, the difference between Dzogchen and Mahamudra is method. There are also differences in the way the basis is explained and so on, but mostly, the difference is in method. If you are not using Dzogchen methods, you are not practicing Dzogchen. For example, in Kalacakra one works with visions, but it is not the same as thogal, as Dudjom Rinpoche clearly points out in his book.

Are you familiar with Moksaragupta or are you speculating? Because the Doha and commentary are not about path of channels and winds. It's about the innate. And Saraha and commentators all trounce the path of means.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, I am familiar with Moksakaragupta. It is as I said the signs I mentioned are the signs being referred to.

Sahaja is the result, among other things. As the Hevajra Tantra says "The innate is said to be awakening".

Completion stages are the means to realize that.

I don't believe that Saraha really slighted creation and completion stage. If he did, why would he have bothered to pass on Guhyasamaja, Cakrasamvara and so on?

Also Virupa, for example says:

Some are completely tortured with empowerment rites,
some always count their rosary saying hūm phat,
some consume shit, piss, blood, semen and meat,
some meditate the yoga of nadi and vāyu, but all are deluded.

But we know quite well that Virupa attained realization with a karmamudra. So there must be another meaning. It is as Tilopa says

If one relies on a karmamudrā, the wisdom of bliss and emptiness arises, 
...
if one has no desire the wisdom of wisdom of bliss and emptiness will not blaze.

He also says:

Practitioners of mantra, of the perfections, 
of discipline, and of the sutras and so on
do not see the luminosity of mahāmudra,
with their own texts and theories;
luminosity is not seen, obscured with such wishful thinking.

All of these warnings are in place so that practitioner does not lose the main point in getting attached to various experiences that arise in creation and completion stage. They are not informing people to abandon the practice of the two stages.

Now then, the whole concept of "other-power" in Jodo shin shu is really based on this simple principle. A person of shinjin is someone who implicitly trusts Amitabha's aspiration and says his  name once. This is the basis of the debate between "once-calling" and "many-calling".

I am not in the habit of accepting things merely because some person with a high worldly position [and yes, by that I mean all the high lamas in Tibetan Buddhism] says it. I keep my own counsel with regards to these things, keeping Tibetan cultural institutions like tulku recognitions separate from the Dharma.

Regarding the terminology used.."story".

Perhaps this is unintended but the way this is being used infers some differing tale.
Past lives being perceived by one may indeed, as most here know, be a progressive thing for some.
With more spiritual understanding  comes more recollection.
On occasion a circumstance may also presents in which the elicitation of a memory of past lives ensues.
A past spiritual life of attainment is perhaps replicated in this life. As that replication occurs prior capacity may also occur.

So I would say it is quite normal for one to have them not one day and have them the next.

Just to clarify that as the term seemed or could be taken to infer a story was being told.

Buddhas have perfect recall of their past lives. In fact, any highly realized bodhisattva on the stages will.

Tenzin1 said:
The origins of the Tibetan people are much more complex than simply migrations from the east. Current scholarship also postulates a migration from the north or north-east as well.  Genetic analysis shows that Tibetan nomads have Altaic ancestry as well as Iranian or Indo-European, while sedentary Tibetans have mainly Sinitic ancestry. And linguistic analysis confirms this north Asian/South Asian ethnic split; the vocabulary is largely Sinitic, while the grammar has Altaic features.

Malcolm wrote:
Tibetan Nomads and the people of the Yarlung Dynasty are two distinct peoples, we agree. Tibetan nomads adopted Tibetan language, but in areas where they are stronger, places such as Golog, their language has more variance from standard Tibetan. We also know that people from Kham do not consider themselves "Bod pa", Tibetans.

But this is precisely my point, pots are not people. We are not going to learn very much about the roots of Tibetan culture and so on by looking at Zhang Zhung archaeology. We will probably not even learn very much about Bon.

Bon however is a religion that calls itself "The original pre-Buddhsit religion of Tibet" and therefore, since it sites itself in Zhang Zhung, the motive for doing archaeology in that region is, at this point, inextricably bound up with the question of Bon in Tibetan culture.

It seems to me though that if we are not at a certain stage of realization, we have to approach "emptiness" conceptually, at least so we can know what it is not. Though understanding via concept and definition are not finally prajna, we still may need them as signposts.

There's a difference between understanding emptiness and realizing emptiness. The former by nature implies concept and even the idea of self. (There has to be someone who "stands under" it).

Concept, though, necessarily involves distance -- to conceive of something means you are regarding it (from outside). So it follows that a person who "conceives" emptiness cannot be realizing it fully.

Not meaning to be pushy, but might anyone here have a take on my question above?
Can we posit emptiness simply as a subtractive process -- i.e. as the result of abandoning all wrong views?

Update:

Have been working on an interesting text by Sakya Pandita on the history of Cakrasamvara.

According to this history, the first human being to receive Cakrasamvara was Saraha I, the teacher of the tantric siddha, Nāgārjuna. In terms of when Saraha lived, he does not really say, apart from asserting that Saraha is present at Shri Parvata (Sri Sailam in modern India) in Andhra Pradesha as a sambhogakāya.

Luhipa was the disciple of Saraha II aka Shavaripa. Sapan definitely situates him during the reign of the famed Buddhist king of Bengal, Shri Dharmapala, whose reign extended circa 775 to 810 CE.

Luihipa was a scribe in the court of Dharmapāla until he met Savaripa. We do not know when Luhipa was active during this 35 year period, but since his retreat was 9-12 years, and since legend holds that Dharmapāla became a disciple of Luhipa, we assume a later date for Luhipa and put his encounter with Dharmapāla around 810. Supposedly Dharmapāla left his kingdom and took a job as a pounder of rice in what is now known as Orrisa becoming known as the siddha Demgipa.

From Demgipa on, a significant feature of Cakrasamvara practice is the requirement that high cast practitioners take low caste occupations under low cast woman.

In any event, we have a fairly firm range to date the Cakrasamvara tantra from -- given this we can presume that the Cakrasamvara must date to the early 8th century CE. Since it mentions the Guhyasamaja and a number of other tantras, we can date those, as well as Saraha I, the first Siddha, to the late 7th century CE.

Also Situ Panchen asserts that Lohipa revealed the Yoginisamcarya tantra, which details the process of the sadhana practice.

This has a happy consequence for the Mahamudra text in the Vima Nyinthig which mentions Saraha by name.

I notice that the texts are written in Tibetan, not the Zhang Zhung script.  Do you know if the Zhang Zhung language was pre-Tibetan, and if so, to what language family it belonged?  Is there linguistic information available on the Zhang Zhung language?

The film comes to the conclusion that ancient Bon did include "ultimate teachings". But the texts are said to date only to approx. 1400 AD, which is quite late in Zhang Zhung history.   This is hardly proof that early Bon contained teachings about liberation.  More research needs to be done.  In any case, why should Bon practitioners feel that they need to somehow measure up to Buddhism?  The shamanic tradition is worthy of respect in its own right.

The Karmapa's website used to have information on Zhang Zhung that said it had been a matriarchal society. Even though the tradition now appears to be controlled by monks, could that have been a later, Tibetan-influenced phenomenon?  Practitioners of the older, shamanic traditions, according to film footage I have of  Ladakhi "oracles" practicing their craft, are women.

From what I've read and studied, it seems to me that his family felt the same way.  Do you think Sakyamuni's wife and child called him "Cowardly?"

Sorry Namdrol but you are

Can you or anyone address the REAL LIFE ACTIONS of the Buddha.

Malcolm wrote:
I did. Buddha had twelve deeds. So did Tonpa Shenrab. But they are different twelve deeds, because they are different emanations who lived at different times and served different cultures.

For example, the past Buddha Sikhin did not form a monastic Sangha. So none of his followers were monastic. He was not a monastic.

Whether one has a family or not has nothing to do with whether one is a fully awakened buddha.

In this case, you are barking up the wrong tree. Sakyamuni Buddha was fully awakened because he was a _nirmanakāya_. His specific manifestation, being born as a Kṣatriya, leaving home, was all part of his display relevant to Indian culture in 5th century BCE.

Shakyamuni Buddha was an emanation. He emanated a type of Nirmanakāya suitable for that particular culture.

Your Bonpo friend is does not seem to understand the principle of emanations, or he is conveniently forgetting it for the purpose of polemics.

According to Mahāyāna accounts, Śākyamuni Buddha did not "achieve" awakening. He was awakened many countless eons ago.

Kamtsang Kagyu practice is based on Luipa and Krishnacharya, though it's a unique transmission stemming from Marpa and subsequent masters.


Malcolm wrote:
The Sakya school has three separate transmissions of Cakrasamvara, and three separate traditions of Vajrayogini.

All of the Cakrasamvara transmissions come through Naropa. They are Luyipa, Ghantapada and Krishnacarya. Of these, the Luyipa and Krishnacarya traditions are more widely practiced. And of these two, the Krishnacarya tradition is the most popular. It also has the largest number of commentaries.

The Ghantapada tradition is more emphasized in the Gelug school, this tradition nevertheless comes from Sakya.

As far as the completion stage practice of Luyipa goes, Luyipa did not write a completion stage text. There are only five or six texts attributed to him in the Tengyur. This does not mean he did not have completion stage instructions -- it just means he did write them down. Luyipa's disciple was Darikpa, and Darikpa's disciple was Ghantapada.

You are correct, Tsongkhapa did write a commentary on completion stage of this system.

All of this happened while the Fifth was a child and a young man. He was born in 1617. He had very little to do with the suppression of the Kagyu school.

Enochian said:
Only later did this tantra come to be interpreted through creative commentary as being about tummo.

From what I can tell, tummo as practiced today has no textual justification save for a couplet from the Hevajra tantra.

Not that it matters, since these things were taught by omniscient Mahasiddhas.

Malcolm wrote:
As I mentioned, the tummo in the new tantra schools for the most part depend on Krishnacarya's instruction. However, tummo also shows up in the Sahajasiddhi of Dombhi Heruka.

It seems that indeed Tummo was adapted to Cakrasamvara from the Hevajra system, perhaps because the Samputa tantra is a common commentary to both. The Tummo instructions which are given a verse in Hevajra are elaborated in the Samputa tantra in a section called the Vasantatilaka (which is also a meter in Sanskrit poetics),"the ornament of spring" which may be found in the sixth kalpa of the Samputa (the Samputa is divided into ten kalpas, each having four sub-sections, for a total of roughly forty chapters).

The earliest completion stage manual we have on Cakrasamvara is Ghantapada's five stages (not to be confused with Nagarjuna's five stages connected with Guhyasamaja). Caṇḍalī yoga (gtum mo) is distinctly absent from that text. However, in the outer five deity sadhana written by Chogyal Phagpa, the completion stage given for that sadhana is directly based on subsection two of the sixth section of the Samputa. Perhaps it is because this tradition comes from Mardo Lotawa who also translated Krishancarya's Vasantatilaka.

The completion stage manuals of Krishnacarya all center around the concept of the Vasantatilaka, and one of them is explicitly named as such. Krishnacarya writes that vasanta, spring, means "when the wind ceases, after the breath of the right and the left goes into the nostrils".  This Vasantatilaka was also translated by Mardo.

As a testament to the enduring popularity of the Vasantatilaka system, Vanaratna, the last Indian Mahasidda to visit Tibet (15th century) wrote a commentary on Krishnacarya's text some 40 folios in length which is also preserved in the Tengyur.

It is in the commentaries by Sachen on the Krishnacarya corpus that we find the clearest indication of the process of attaining rainbow about according to the Cakrasamvara system in the Sakya school.

Well, there are traces of post-Indian adaptation nadi theory in the Vima Nyinthig material.

The problem with this is that kun 'dar ma is the Tibetan translation of avadhūti.

The point I was making was that Buddhist Yogis in India adapted Hindu yogic terms to Buddhism. Then, in Tibet, Nyingma Yogis adapted newer tantric materials [i.e. mother tantra] being brought into Tibet after 950 and used this material as the basis for reformulating their yogic traditions, including Dzogchen.

But you are saying it's hard to know when these truly appeared, because they don't appear until Chetsun Wangchuk 10th Cen, and there are uncanny similarities between practices in Nyingthig tradition and Kalachakra which arrives also around 10th Cen and thrived in a nearby or same region as Nyingthig?

Malcolm wrote:
The seventeen tantras do talk about the three channels, four cakras, and so on. But as we known, Chetsun was mid 11th -- early 12th century. As I mentioned to you, he met with Zhangton Tashi Dorje in 1123 and passed away (i.e. rainbowed) shortly thereafter.

Cakras and so on do not figure much into Guhyasamaja practice at all. So while Guhyasamaja practice entered Tibet very early, during the eighth century, its completion stage practices were not well developed until ninth century in India (i.e. the Pañcakrama,etc.).

Three channels and four cakras is, in Indian Buddhist tantra, apparently a mother tantra sort of thing. Seems to show up first in Hevajra (Cakrasamvara root tantra is arguably older than the Hevajra), then in other Cakrasamvara commentary tantras and so on.

Kalacakra arrives in Tibet in 1027 CE i.e. early 11th century. 1027 is the first year of the sixty year cycle of the Tibetan calendar. One of the reasons dates before this time are so sketchy is that well, 1027 CE is the first totally reliable date we have in Tibetan history and everything is calculated from that date. Tibetans themselves are quite unclear about dates, and for many dates in the Imperial period we have had to rely on external documents from Chinese records to date events in Tibet History. Western scholars too did not invent this system. This approach to fixing Tibetan dates by using Chinese annals is also used in the Blue Annals by the 15th century Kagyu historian Go Lotsawa Zhonnu Pal. A good book about early Tibetan history is The Tibetan Empire in Central Asia by Beckwith.

But limitation of the text critical approach is that you cannot measure the age of an idea, only the age of the first text in which an idea appears. As we know, the ideas of channels and so on is much older in Hindu literature. For example, the Candogya Upanishad discusses nadis including a nadi than seems to resemble the central channel.

http://www.ashtangayoga.info/philosophy/upanishads/chadogya-upanishad/ " onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;

There are many ideas in the Buddhist tantras that make their first textual appearance in the pre-Buddhist Upanishads.

But in terms of when these ideas first appear in Buddhist texts, they seem to appear extremely late in Buddhist history.

Malcolm wrote:
That is an interesting question. We actually have complaints by Nyingma authors from the tenth century expressing concern about new-fangeled, new-age clap trap yoga practices using cakras, and so on, borrowed from Hindus and being imported from India. It suggests that tummo was adapted from the mother tantras when they came to Tibet.

However, it is very hard to be certain because Tummo and so on are mentioned in various Nyingma tantras which are hard to date.

Interestingly, Guru Chowang has a terma of the six yogas of Naropa which is in the Rinchen Terzö.

The opinion of several western scholars is that Nyingmapas borrowed many practices from the mother tantras, such as body mandalas and so on forth after the 11th century. Or for another example, the notion of the twenty four pithas is entirely based on the Cakrasamvara/Hevajra tradition. While it is possible that this idea was introduced to Tibet with Padmasambava (these two tantras were certainly extant in India during the eighth century), or later in the ninth century or tenth century (because we have Cakrasamvara completion stage documents at Tunhuang that may date to the mid tenth-century) we don't really see this idea expressed, so far as I know, in the the classical set of Nyingma tantras. However, the caveat is that the 40 or so volumes of Nyingma tantras have been largely unexplored.

Only later did this tantra come to be interpreted through creative commentary as being about tummo.

From what I can tell, tummo as practiced today has no textual justification save for a couplet from the Hevajra tantra.

Not that it matters, since these things were taught by omniscient Mahasiddhas.


Malcolm wrote:
well, this is not exactly true -- for example, in Yoga Tantra they practice an "inner fire puja" and the chapter on the fire puja in Cakrasamvara is understood to indicate tummo practice.

The common source of tummo in Kagyu, Sakya and Gelug is the tummo instruction from Krishnacarya. This is the origin of tummo in the six yogas of Naropa, and is preserved as an Independent instruction in Lamdre.

Title: Sakya POV on the origin of the Cakrasamvara Tantras
Content:
Malcolm wrote:
This is what Indian scholars say about the identity of the teacher who taught the Cakrasamvara Tantras, according to extensive history of Cakrasamvara written by the great Sakya Polymath and 28th throne holder of Sakya, Ngawang Kunga Sonam (1597-1659/1660, http://tbrc.org/link?RID=P7900 " onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;).

He writes:
Unknown said:
"Bhavabhata and Bhavyakirit both hold that "This teacher (i.e. Śakyamuni) having attained buddhahood in the beginningless past taught the Cakrasamvara tantras, but later, after becoming the son of Śuddodana, did not teach it. Their reasoning holds that since Cakrasamvara is continually practiced by the heros and yoginis of the twenty four countries, even when eon forms and perished (the twenty four countries) do not form and perish so [the Cakrasamvara] does not disappear. Even though other dharmas may have also been taught in the beginning, since they are destroyed by the formation and perishing of the eon, since they disappear during the interval, they must be taught again by Śākyamuni.

The commentary on the root tantra by Indrabhuti II gives a citation:

"Having tamed the maras, which shows the manner of awakening, 
having seen the strength of the activity of the Sugatas,
in the place called Mt. Dhanyakata
the source of the dharma that exhausts passion,
in the mandala circle the hero well taught 
the great secret to a countless assembly
eight hundred million yoginis and more…" etc.

Guided by this, first, the Cakrasamvara tantra is taught without interruption in the Akaniṣṭa, the location of the buddhas (as opposed to the god realm Akaniṣṭa); in middle, having emanated on the peak of Sumeru, and later, having manifested the twelve deeds in Jambudvipa after turning the three wheels of Dhrma, for the benefit of fortunate disiples the Bhagavan entered into the samadhi of Śrī Cakarasamvara on the mountain of Śrī Dhanyakataka, emanated the mandala circle and taught the Cakrasamvara tantras to eight hundred million yoginis. Having also demonstrated the method of taming Rudra-Bhairava with his retinue, he [Indrabhuti II] holds that once again it was recited and taught by Śākyamuni

The Ḍākārṇava Tantra (one of the commentary tantras of Cakrasamvara) states:
In the kali yuga this will
be taught by countless bhagavans. 
The tantra taught by Śākyasimha 
carry one to the other shore of yoga.

The Commentary on the Ḍākārṇava tantra [by Padmavajra] states, "Again, in the kali yuga, three million, six hundred thousand major tantras were taught by Śākyasimha."

Therefore, after having first been explained by the heruka of the cause, the sambhogakāya, it explained that it was repeated again and taught.

The commentary by Master Vajra states, "During the Dvāparayuga, Rudra Maheśvara was tamed. Though it [the root tantra] was taught at that time, here, the one to tame, Iśvara also arose at the beginning of the Kaliyuga. After they were tamed by Heruka with his retinue, the tantra was taught as it was stated in the Ḍākārṇava tantra.

Now the reason for teaching [the root tantra] in the Kaliyuga is stated in The Vajrapātāla Tantra:

Time is divided into four ages
the tantra division is divided into four sections.

The four tantra divisions are taught intending disciples of the four ages. Also the reason the anuttarayoga is taught in Kaliyuga is that the disciples of that age are very afflicted, it is intended for those with coarse three poisons to take the path or root of awakening, as it is stated in the Herukābhyudaya Tantra:

Having been cared for by Śrī Heruka,
there will be success in the degenerate age.

Therefore, in terms of the [perfect] time, when it was time to tame Rudra with his retinue in Jambudvipa, inside the mandala emanated in Mt. Meru, Bhagavan along with his retinue were arranged in the mandala wheel. According the explanatory tantras, after Śrī Vajrapani offered a ganacakra, since he requested that the root tantra be explained, in the perfect place, the peak of Mt. Meru, the nature of the teacher's body, speech and mind, the result Heruka, Cakrasamvara, placed the tamed retinue, Rudra Bhairava with retinue into the mandala. And he taught the perfect Dhama the trio of extensive, medium and concise root tantras of Cakrasamvara to the deities of the five wheels, and moreover, the buddhas and bodhisattvas equal with the atoms in Mt. Meru, the fortune gods and humans, the retinue, the petitioner and the collator, Vārāhī, and so.

However, Vajrapani's [i.e. the tenth stage bodhisattva] Commentary on the Upper Section explains the petitioner for that mandala demonstrated above was Vajravārāhi and also she was the teacher of the Cakrasamvara tantras. Vajrapani's Commentary on the Upper Section states:
In this time of the five degenerations,
in order to attain the result of merit and wisdom,
Vārāhi made a supplication, and the one with the vajra 
clarified this concise tantra.

And the Herukābhyudaya Tantra states:
After that, after all the heros stood
the hero Vajrapani and so on,
and made a request to the lady of the mandala.

Having called on the mother to intercede, it is explained that she was requested to teach the tantra.

Though it may be so that someone explains she taught the Vārāhī tantra, and Vajradhara is the petitioner,  Buton Rinpoche explains there is no contradiction because of the vision of the individual person to be tamed.

Therefore, Bhavyakirti and so on’s explanation that this tantra was not repeated again by our teacher (Śakyamuni) as it was shown above and the citation from The Ḍākārṇava Tantra i.e. “In the kali yuga this will be taught by countless bhagavans” may seem to be in conflict but in reality they are not in conflict. The former positions intends that this teacher (Śakyamuni) did not again recite and teach the tantra after having performed the twelve deeds in Jambudvipa. The latter citation intends a time in the Kali Yuga prior to performing the twelve deeds. When it is explained that the tantra was taught after [Sakyamuni] performed the twelve deeds, though Śakyamuni himself taught many tantras of secret mantra to the uncommon disciples and the some like Guhyasamaja were by taught by other emanations of the powerful Muni, the Tattvasaṃgraha and the Cakrasamvara tantras were not taught at that time as it is explained by Loppon Sonam Tsemo, “Other than his general activities, he did not recite or teach later on. Having taught the Tattvasamgraha in the beginning, after completing that tantra he arrived in human lands....” and so on.

Likewise, "...he performed the deeds of arriving in Jambudvipa, etc., but he did not recite or teach the Śrī Cakrasamvara Tantra later on” is the position of master Bhavyakirti. Since his commentary on the root tantra starting from “The category of Dharma has a continuity of beginningless time, taught by the Bhagavan Śakyamuni in the past....” to the end of that citation “...like it is explained”, the position of Bhavyakirti is made our position. Having summarized the meaning of those, also the The Clear Ornament of The Three Modes states “...not including the Tattvasamgraha and Cakrasamvara”.

Malcolm wrote:
So there you have it, according to the Sakya school, the Cakrasamvara Tantra (and the Tattvasamgraha) was not taught this time around by Śakyamuni Buddha.

Malcolm wrote:
TIlopa received the Cakrasamvara empowerments from a siddha named Kuśalana. He certainly also received the transmission directly, just as Naropa received the transmission for Vajrayogini directly from Vajrayogini, etc. Why do we know this? Beause Sakya has detailed lineage lists and histories of the masters of Cakrasamvara.

And with all due respect to your teacher, Vajradhara is a sambhogakāya embodiment of the dharmakāya. The dharmakāya is called Samantabhadra, as I mentioned now several times, in Yoga tantra as well as Guhyasamaja.

And Shakyamuni is an emanation of Vajradhara, as is Garab Dorje, etc. All nirmanakāyas are emanations of the Sambhogakāya. Likewise, Shri Heruka is a nirmanakāya emanation of the Sambhogakāya.

In short, you are merely reciting an opinion usually found in Kagyu and Gelug than in Nyingma and Sakya. In Nyingma for example, they hold that Shakyamuni never taught tantra above kriya tantra, and that it was Padmasambhava who spread the tantras in Jambudvipa.

There are conflicting accounts of the genesis of the Hevajra tantra.

So it is better to leave these histories (often mutually conflicting) at the level of legend and not presume they refer to historical facts.

And as someone who was trained in Sakya, I prefer the Sakya account -- a) Sambhogakāya is the author and source of all Vajrayāna teachings, when it says thus have I head, it means it was spoken by the Sambhogakāya and heard by Vajrapani, not by Ananda. B) "The single vajra word is heard differently by those of different capacity". This means a) we do not need to be worried about whether Sakyamuni had anything to with the tantras, or Mahāyāna, since Manjushri is the one who heard Mahayāna, according to this understanding b) it allows for the evolution of dharma according to the needs of people and their capacity.

Namdrol said:
Authorship is who wrote it down. Who knows who finally wrote down an oral transmission or saw a vision of a transmission? By the time someone writes it down it's passed through several ears and mouths anyway. The question is did the Buddha Shakyamuni transform his body and speak words about dakinis and sex for someone to hear. That is strictly a faith question, and no evidence will ever come out to say otherwise.

That might be your interpretation re yanas. That view is not shared by Kagyu. I mentioned Garab Dorje in my passage is the Nirmanakaya who brought Dzogchen here. You skimmed. According to the Chakrasamvara Shakyamuni is transformed into Heruka to subjugate Mahadeva and Kalaratri. It is his connection that makes the tantra a possible continuum.

Malcolm wrote:
No, this not so and not one single Indian commentary maintains this (out of thirteen commentaries on the root tantra alone). This is just later Tibetans freaked out the heterodox nature of the tantras, trying to whitewash all of this to fit their preconceived notions. Moreover, Cakrasamvara does not even begin with evam māyam srutam.

And then what about the tantras that begin "This at one time did I teach..." like guhyasamaja which are all set in Akanistha Gandavyhua.

Also Hevajra explicitly begins, "thus I heard," indicating Shakayamuni will speak according to the tradition of nidana

This does not prove that Shakyamuni Buddha taught the text. But hey, your faith is yours. You keep it. If you want to be snowed by literary conventions -- that is your business.

There are suttas in the Pali Canon that explicitly date from after Buddha's parinirvana that begin with evam māyam srutam. There is one such text in the Majjihma Nikāya. Not every text that begins with evam maya srutam issued from the mouth of Sakyamuni -- for example, all of the Dzogchen tantras -- not a single one was ever taught by our pal Gotama Buddha.

It is an inference based partly on the appearance of sutras in translation into Chinese, the noted evolution of these sutras in Chinese translation, comparisons with their late and in many cases final forms in Tibetan translation; the clear evolution of Indian tantras in Sanskrit, and in Tibetan translation, differing versions of the same text between new and older recensions, etc. The gradual evolution of tantra, uttaratantras, etc. The evolution of commentaries on these tantras, when they first appear, etc., intertextuality with non-buddhist tantras, and so on. The mutual rise of Buddhist and non-Buddhsit tantra, etc.

There are very many excellent reasons to assume that both Mahāyāna literature and Vajrayāna primary literature evolved in a manner that is simply absent in Nikāya/Agama sources. There is no evidence whatever to suggest that any Mahāyāna texts ever were communicated through an oral lineage like the Nikāya/Agamas. Even the so called gatha portion of these texts it turns out are generally _later_ in composition than the prose portions they summarize.

adinatha said:
This assumes that what was found is all there is to find, that what was written encompasses what was said, or that what was written was written at the time it was said.

Malcolm wrote:
Not at all, it merely assumes that we have what we have, and we can examine what we have, study what we have, and limit our knowledge to what real evidence we do have.

It does not presume "new" tantras cannot be written (they can and are).

But there are obvious flaws in your view, not present in the view of those who regard Mahāyāna abd Vajrayāna texts as results of (inspired) literary production -- one, your view cannot explain the definite use of literary artifice and style in Mahāyāna sutras, cannot explain the codification and stylization completely absent in the NIkayas/Agamas; cannot explain the explict addressing of sectarian points by Mahāyāna sutras to Abhidharma concepts which are definitely found only in texts that post date the Buddha by many centuries.

For example, the Hevajra Tantra mentions Vaibhashika, Sautrantika, Yogachara and Madhyamaka. One might suppose that in Buddha's omniscience he predicted these schools; or occams razor style, one might just understand that the Hevajra tantra was composed after the catursiddhanta system was finalized sometime in the mid sixth century with Madhyamaka at the top. Even further, there is no evidence that categories such as "kriya, carya, and Yoga" tantra existed prior to the ninth century, since such categories are completely absence in tantric taxonomical commentaries written in the eighth century, and only really appear with Vajramālā tantr (the main commentary tantra on the Guhysamaja) which was not composed prior to the beginning of the ninth century based on its own appearance in Tibetan translation as well as its commentary. And we have a lot of information about the primitive i.e. pre-Vajramālā Guhyasamaja tradition.

For me it does not matter at all whether it was "revealed" or composed. It is a very interesting text that introduces most of doctrine we have about the ten vāyus, the notion of "bindu" and so on forth. My personal assumption is that it was composed by a yogi/yogis.

I could care less who it was supposedly taught by.

One of the things that shows a shift about tantric mis en scene among Indians is the relocation of the scene of the teachings from Nirmanakāya locations that we find in lower tantras up to Yoga tantra to Sambhogakāya dimensions like the "bhaga of the mother" and so on in Hevajra and other tantras, or Akanishtha Gandavyuha in Guhygarbha, etc. (which is very influential on Tibetan composition Dzogchen tantra mis en scene).

I have translated a lot of Indian Tantric Material and Nyingma tantric material. There stark stylistic differences between tantras composed in India and tantras composed in Tibet. Most Nyingma(but not all) tantras were definitely composed in Tibet by Tibetans.

So again, I restate my POV. Authorship does not matter. This is a worry for fundamentalists, not scholars, and not yogis.

In this I prefer to follow the Sakya school's point of view, i.e., the definitive rūpakāya is Sambhogakāya. And in reality, there is only one teacher, the Dharmakāya Samantabhadra, since dharmakāya is the mind of all buddhas.

If you impose the condition that the teacher must be present for the transmission to take place, then what you are essentially saying is that "thing Y" is something that can only be transmitted personally by the teacher.  If so, then what is this "thing Y" that is being "transmitted" in an empowerment?  Certainly not the words of the vajra master during an empowerment because words can be transmitted via a recorder too.  If you say it is to establish a "connection", then reasons should be provided as to why the "connection" cannot be established via a third object like a recorder.

Shin Buddhism entrusts in the “Other Power” of Amida Buddha’s Wisdom and Compassion and does not rely upon our self-centered attempts to attain Enlightenment. The Historic Buddha, Sakyamuni Buddha, is recognized as a human manifestation of Amida Buddha who appeared to share the Nembutsu Dharma or Teachings of the Nembutsu. In Shin Buddhist Temples, Amida Buddha is the Object of Reverence.

I'm only pointing out some interesting parallels between Judeo-Christian practices and Indo-Tibetan.  Egypt surely knew about the Kundalini, as practices to raise the Kundalini for healing purposes go back eons in Africa, and there's some speculation that Jesus went to Alexandria during his youth and young adulthood (the "lost years"), where there was also a Buddhist community.

I've read that the text in Ladakh was a copy of one in Lhasa, but the supposed original has never been found, so idk.  However, by the time Jesus arrived in India, Pali was heavily Sanskritized and was no longer a spoken language.  Scholars say that North India recorded events in their own dialects, and that would have been true of Kashmir, certainly. Or Sanskrit could have been used. We don't know the language of the original recording of the events of Jesus' live in the East.  I don't see how Pali is relevant to this question.

I've read the denunciations of Notovich, I'm not going to comment on him.  However, if you don't believe that the Roerichs, who are highly reputable, found and translated the text, and published news of their finding in US newspapers, call the Roerich Museum.

A little understood point of the difference between an affirming negation and a non-affirming negation is that the former is used to defend one's own position while the later is used to reject an opponents position. Since a Madhyamaka has no opinions, only non-affirming negations are utilized in Madhyamaka.

[Minds (plural) don't need a material substrate. They are not, from a common Buddhist point of view dependent on matter -- for this reason in Abhidharma through anuttarayoga tantra formless realm beings have no location and are really without material attributes of any kind.

adinatha said:
The formless realms are what a yogi errantly enters; they depend on a yogi. This is going to get me into something we have discussed before, that the material is not what it appears. Physical and mental have no discrete boundaries. The formless realm beings do have attributes of attachment, an attraction to and grasping of the formless realm state and are thus temporal-spatial and impermanent. Space has no location, so all sentient beings fall into the category of no location. Abhidharma says many useful things, but I don't think it is always authoritative.

Malcolm wrote:
It it is not authoritative, but it is foundational. It provides the basic definitions that inform many assumptions that inform all the so called higher yānas.

To the extent the Abhidharma sought to show that atoms have no inherent existence it is on the right track. But its error in facts shows that it did not originate in an omniscient mind.


Malcolm wrote:
Nevertheless, there are assumptions present in Abhidharma texts which are present even in Dzogchen texts, things like the structure of atoms, Sumeru cosmology, etc.

Further to what Namdrol said, we have a sort of linguistic issue here. Unlike in Tibet, where there is one translation of the word upadesha as "menga" in English there is not yet an agreed protocol to follow in translation so often familiar words become unfamiliar when used by a different translator.

Even in TIbetan there are so many closely related words. For example Upadesha some times comes out as a rather vague "Oral transmission" which strictly is closer to ka-gyud or "line by mouth", "nyen-gyud" or “whispered line” amongst others.

The problem is (i) humans are imperfect (ii) tend to be imprecise and and moreover like like to do things their own way.

The earliest English language reference that Jesus was anywhere near the Himalayas is Isis Unveiled, published in 1877.

Based on this, one Nicolas Notovitch concocted the La vie inconnue de Jesus Christ, published in English in 1890 as The Unknown Life of Christ.

Then finally, this book was composed, The Aquarian Age Gospel of Jesus, the Christ of the Piscean Age, written by Levi H. Dowling (May 18, 1844 - August 13, 1911) and first published in 1908.

Why intimate? - Maybe because they are to be transmitted to very few people at a time - like three or two or one - hence intimate.

There are two kinds of brahmin, nirguna (without qualities) and saguna (with qualities). The former refers to brahmin as pure being, consciousness, and bliss. The latter refers to the personification of Brahmin as a godhead for those in the state of illusion (maya).

In Mahāyāna Buddhism, even ultimate reality is unreal.

Doxology would be the study/word (logos, λόγος) of how one praises, honours, or glorifies (doxo, δόξα).  This would include liturgies and hymns but also icons, literature, sculpture, architecture and even forms of theology.

If one is practicing according to the instructions of Naro Khachod, for example, no consort is necessary for realizing mahāmudra.

As for the second point, the practice of the third empowerment has been translated from Lamdre. There is not much variation over all in the consort practice instruction in different schools. In general, consort practice is a feature of mother tantra, and not so much a feature of father tantra.

[If I read the 5 precepts and keep them is not the same if I hear and then keep them - no reason why.

Malcolm wrote:
Do you think that you can just decide to a be bhiḳsu, shave your head, put on robes, and that is sufficient. Do you think you can be a monk or a nun without being ordained?

You have to receive them (precepts) from someone who holds those precepts. You cannot take them on your own. Keeping the five precepts does not have the force of the vows unless they are received according to the rite of either an upasaka, shramanera or bhikṣu.

Why is so? It is so because the Buddha set the system up. It is true that the ordination of monks evolved from a simple declaration "Now you are bhikṣus" to an elaborate rite of bestowing the vows with a quorum of monks and so on during the Buddha's lifetime. Differences in vinayas arose because monks were being ordained by senior Arhats hundreds of miles from where the Buddha was living and differences crept into the ritual for bestowing vows. But the key point is that one must receive the vows from someone who holds them. You cannot receive pratimoksha vows from a video, not can you take them on your own. All vows come from the Buddha. If you want vows, you must take them from a Buddhist who holds them.

The exception to this is bodhisattva vows (in the madhyamaka system). In the Madhyamaka system, if there is no preceptor available to grant bodhisattva vows, one may take them through a visualization.

Otherwise, all Pratimoksha vows and Vajrayāna vows must be received from a preceptor or guru, each according to its own proper rite.

Vajrayāna teachings may only be given to people who hold Vajrayāna vows. This is why the first portion of any empowerment is conferral of the basic Vajrayāna vows; with more vows being conferred with each successive level of empowerment. In this context, it is like preparing a field before you plant.

Transmission is a living thing, not something one can receive from relic.

Sherab criticized the seal and impression. But he/she does not understand a critical point -- thinking that one can receive transmission from a recording is like imagining that a rubbing done of a an impression is equivalent to act of stamping an impression with a seal. In this case, the problem is that there is no transmission since there is only one person involved i.e. the person playing the recording. Transmission requires two people, a person giving transmission and a person receiving transmission. They must somehow be related to each other through the act of delivering the substance of transmission which is act of communication by a speaker to a hearer via sounds, words and symbols at minimum. In Vajrayāna there is are further experiential transmissions which come about when the teacher deliberately induces specific experiences in a student. But again, it is through sound, words, and symbols. Taste, sight, touch, etc., these experiences are symbols.

So in summary, Astus, transmissions is nothing mystical, but it does require two parties who are engaged in an the act of transmission, one giving, the other receiving,at the same time. Without this, there is no transmission.

Transmission means direct communication from one person who has some knowledge (in this case, creation and completion stage, dzogchen, etc) to someone who wants to develop that knowledge themselves. There are different methods for giving transmission. But they all share one thing in common -- a realized teacher communicates using words and similes and a student listens and understands at the same time. This is really not so fricking hard to understand. So I don't see why you are wasting people's time with this inane question anymore.

]Don't forget that you are in the Kagyu forum Dechen and that each tradition has its own "version" and approach to ngondro and that they are not really interchangable.

Malcolm wrote:
The real meaning of "ngondro" is Guru yoga. First it is guru yoga to a guru in front of you; then on top of your head; then in front you to whom you make offerings; then in front of you from whom you receive empworments.

As long as it is understood that ngondro is guru yoga in the beginning, in the middle, and in the end, then this should remove obstacles to practice.

There is no practice more profound than Guru Yoga, it is the defining practice of Vajrayāna which is not present in Mahayāna or lower tantras.

Group karma is similar results from similar causes. Each individual has its own continuum, suffering alone. It is like a mirroring effect. The nature of awareness is mirror-like. If I hold up a mirror, and you hold up a mirror while standing nearby one another, we will reflect one another. And so it goes on down the line through space and time. The master/disciple dynamic is just this with regard to body, speech and mind of Buddha.

Astus said:
The nature of awareness being mirror-like doesn't mean that we keep reflecting everything we see. Reflecting to whom, anyway? But this is just a metaphor and it may not necessarily be about the reflective attributes of mirrors. If I sit in front of a person that person's body won't appear as my body, nor will that happen with speech or mind. Where is the mirroring effect then?

Malcolm wrote:
Obustus, I have already explained this to you a hundred times: transmission means a teacher speaks, in words and similes according to his realization. You actively listen and understand. That is transmission. This why, for example, at the end of transmitting vows, the officiating upadhyaya asks you "Are you happy"? This means, "did you really participate in this ritual of transmitting the precepts?"

This is all there is to transmission. It cannot be gained from a book. It must be gained from another living, breathing human being.

Just a thought: in all the sutric accounts of the Buddha's parinirvana, he said the sangha is free to remove the minor rules if they so wish after his death.

Malcolm wrote:

So what you are basically suggesting is that we scrap Mulasarvastivada and Dharmaguptaka. But if you do that, you will scrap the nuns vows in Dharmaguptaka, since they died out in the other two orders (and the reason for their dying out is a gender issue). If you want nuns vows in Thervavada and Tibetan Buddhism, either Theravada and Mulasarvastivada needs to be scrapped, or, things remain at the status quo i.e. nuns who want a valid ordination get that from the Dharmaguptaka lineage.

Someone mentioned that monks form Tibetan Buddhism and Theravada were present at these nuns ordinations -- yes, they were, but not as members of the required quorum. They were present as guests and observers.

Then there is the additional gender issue of the 80 odd extra vows nuns must keep in addition to the monks vows. This is unfair. But will these be scrapped? No. Should they be scrapped, no.

Are all monastic sanghas going to collapse in the next 500 years? Definitely.

Should we be sad? No.

Will there still be Buddhist practice even though the monastic sangha is no more? Yes.

It is simple, if you are poor, you get a poor persons membership ($85.00 per annum) which gives you a %50 discount on retreats.  If you are not a member of the DC, well, what can I say? If you want teachings from ChNN you can always attend _free_ webcasts, as many as you like, you just might have to lose a little sleep. In reality, it is expensive to put on retreats, and every community is independent financially from the others. So, if you can't pay, stay home and watch webcast. If you can pay, go to retreat and enjoy.

But isn't obvious he's taken controversial approaches to the teachings and broken with tradition?

Malcolm wrote:
Nope, it is not obvious at all. I have been his student for 19 years. He is actually a pretty conservative teacher. His attitude toward Bon is no different than the attitude of Guru Chowang, the immediate incarnation of Nyangral, and the terton who revealed the seven line prayer. Guru Chowang wrote in his "Great Origin of Treasures:

"First: the two the supreme of all beneficial qualities, [5/a] the treasure of the true words of Bon emanations: the way the compassionate body came from the pure dimension of the ultimate nature [bon nyid i.e. chos nyid] and the after the treasure of body, speech and mind arose, the way the teaching was spread, i.e. the way a treasure descends from a treasure.

First: the pure dimension of the ultimate nature completely free from falling into any parts or divisions was singular and unique, the treasure of the hidden Bon dharmakāya [bon chos sku] which has nothing to give up, appeared from pure activity to tame beings as the sambhogakāya Shenlha Wodkar [gshen lha 'od dkar]. The way his compassion was moved is that in general he thought of all migrating beings. Specifically, he thought of beings in Jambudvīpa.

Second: after the treasure of the body, speech and mind was produced, the teachings were widely spread. The way the treasure descends from a treasure is that in order to tame the the confusion of ignorance, the root of samsara,at Wolmo Lungring in the land of Zhang Zhung the hidden treasure of compassion arrived in the form of Shenrab Miwoche [gshen rab mi bo che, i.e. the supreme one of the Shen clan, the greatest of men]. The hidden treasure was concealed in a single intention by all the Tathāgatas in the mind of Shenrab, and he taught the nine vehicles of Bon. 

Afterwards, Shenrab's words were collected by the fortune Bonpos and placed in a catalogue. The cause Bon tamed ordinary beings, and result Bon tamed intelligent beings. 

The teachings were spread in Tokharistan, where people wear silk turbans, the land India and the border lands and also spread in dPur rGyal in Tibet and Bon was disseminated in the beginning.

The King was given the name as the Elder Brother of Bon because he made sure the teaching did not decline, and also he concealed the Bon treasures of cause and result in Zhang Zhung the temple of Shampo Lhatse. Furthermore,  as they were spread in the mountain of white peaks in Oddiyana, the Chinese mountain Dru Dzin [5/b] and in southern and northern Tibet, having concealed treasures which descended from treasures, the Bon texts were not destroyed, and the Bonpos became renowned. 

Also I, Chowang, say that the profound teaching of Bon is uninterrupted."

If ChNN is to be faulted for respecting Bon Dzogchen, how much more so the master who originally revealed the seven line prayer? Obviously, Nyingmapas who do not respect Bon also do not respect their own lineage masters.

In reality, the only novel thing ChNN does is not pay lip service to the gradual approach of the gsar ma schools. And even this is not novel, but rather a return to the old Nyingma way of doing things, rather than this neo-Nyingma gradualism.

In reality, what ChNN did was free Dzogchen from Tibetan politics and money games. And for that, some worldly tibetans and westerners wearing robes, who bilk their students of their wealth and rob them of their precious human birth,  who bear the title of this and that rinpoche hate ChNN. Well, f76k them.

In the Theravada vinaya, there must be at least 5 monks present who do not have the parajika offense for the ordination to be valid (Mahavagga, chapter 9, vs 4.1–4.4).

Again, realistically, some where along the line, it has been broken, if you take a literal view.

It is much more likely that in fact, there were several ordinations performed by monks who were later discovered to have committed a parajika offense entailing defeat from the Sanha. Thereby, making all future ordinations in that line broken, according to a literal interpretation.


Malcolm wrote:
Not so, even if there is a unknown parajika among the quorum that was later revealed, all that matters is that the majority of of the monks had fully intact vows. This idea about one parajika was a novelty introduced by Sangharakshita. It is a false assertion.

In your opinion.

In my opinion, the women who took the Theravada ordinations are Theravada bhikkhunis and the women who took the Tibetan vows and vinaya are Tibetan nuns. They follow their respective traditions. The outward form of the rite, ritual, and ceremony is not important. What matters is their devotion and acceptance of the vinaya of their respective traditions.

But even that outward ritual and ceremony included monastics from their own traditions and acceptance from their monk preceptors of their traditions.


Malcolm wrote:
You don't understand. In Tibetan Buddhism, those woman who became bhikṣunis took the Dharmaguptaka ordination since it did not survive in Mulasarvastivada. Those woman in Thailand have a broken ordination. I understand the reasons behind it, but it is not a proper ordination if they did not ordain with Dharmaguptaka nuns.

This is my position. If the male monastic ordination died out, it would be inappropriate to "revive" it. Why, because the direct transmission from the Buddha would have been broken.

It is not about gender, it is about transmission.

There is no term or concept in Dzogchen as being "re-enlightened". Does not exist and does not make sense.

Astus said:
Nevertheless, the above authors did use it with the same meaning in a Dzogchen context. If it is not a traditional term it might be a new one.

Tulku Urgyen's "Repeating the Words of the Buddha" has a whole chapter entitled "Re-enlightenment".

At the second movement, the delusions are dispelled and the (perfection) of primordial wisdom develops. That is the development of the basis (itself) as the result (of enlightenment). It is called the re-enlightenment (or self-liberation) through the realization of the essence, the primordial Buddhahood.
(Longchen Rabjam: The Practice of Dzogchen, p. 207)

Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche said, "The confusion that arose in ... the path can be cleared away. When we remove the temporary stains from primordially awakened rigpa, we become re-enlightened instead of primordially enlightened. This is accomplished by following the oral instructions of a fully qualified master."
(Nyoshul Khenpo: Natural Great Perfection, p. 71)

We should train in the state of rigpa that is originally pure. Although the essence is primordially enlightened, the yogi has to be re-enlightened. We have fallen into delusion. Attaining stability in non-delusion is called re-enlightenment.
(Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche: As It Is, vol. 2, p. 67)

Malcolm wrote:
First of all, Tulku Urgyen never spoke English in his life.

When translators translate things in this way, they cause decades of confusion.

There is no such thing as "re-enlightenment", not in Dzogchen, and not in any other Buddhist school.

1. Reinstate vows based on the example of Buddha, that is some realised monk will simply give the vows to the bikshuni apsirant the same way Buddha gave them to the first bikshunis.

2.Some realised shikshamana would receive this vows in a vision.

Of course there is a problem with that how such ordinations would be accepted by both ordained and lay public.

Earlier you mentioned that the vinayadharas could consolidate the lineages. In this case, could the re-established bhikshunis decide to "consolidate" their lineages to exactly fit those of the lineage they want affiliation with? For example, the Dharmagupta nuns in the Theravadin countries - could the most senior amongst them decide to "consolidate" or fold themselves into the same Bhikkhuni vows that the old Theravadin nuns kept? Since the Vinayadharas appear to have the ability to change the vows according to consensus, would this be a viable method? In any case, isn't this how the various sects grew out of each other? They just changed their ordination procedures to their liking.

There are few who have been willing to study with everyone, whether exhalted or lowly, and there is little real knowledge of the dharma. Especially in these later times there are a great many who, while they themselves are not perfectly upright and do not have a spiritual outlook, talk like arrogant bullies about whether a particular teaching tradition is any good or whether a lineage is pure.

The meditation in Dzogchen is to be in the Natural State, which is united with Thodgal. That is the base to experience the first Lamp with its related Visions.
I guess that would be the right following order of Trekchod and Thodgal. I know that some schools teach Trekchod and Thodgal as separate, but i did learn this as united in the Bon Dzogchen. This means that within the abiding of the Natural State the Visions are self emanated and are in that way inter related.

One reason it is considered "like" the path of seeing, etc. is that when one is engaging in the first two visions, one's course obscurations dissolve. In common mahayana and vajrayana this only happens after one realizes the actual path of seeing. This is a special feature of togal.

Ok fine. Nonetheless there must have been a moment when the pickup truck came into existence. That first moment of existence must have had a cause. By the law of similar causes, the cause in question must have been a pickup truck, not a daffodil. Therefore the pickup truck had a prior existence, a previous life.

Malcolm wrote:
In reality "pickup truck is, like "catmoon", a designation. Pickup truck designates as an assemblage of parts. Those parts are all based on serial process and continuity. The steel in a pickup truck cannot come from plastic, etc.

The difference between a pickup truck and a mind is that a mind is a single substance (dravya). You can assembly a pickup truck out of parts where there was no pickup truck before, only parts. Minds however, are not like that, they are naturally arising entities, not constructed entities. When we talk about "namdrol" or "catmoon" we tend to be referring to all five aggregates, not just the mind that we possess.

Our mental aggregate does not arise from our material aggregate because there is a difference of kind in terms of substance. A pickup truck will never give rise to a mind stream. WIthout our interference in metals and plastics, there would never be a pickup truck.

No one however created our mind, at least, not as far as anyone can tell. we can rule god out, evil demons ala Descartes, chance (since then a mind could arise from a pickup truck and daffodils from cobras), etc. Since our mind is not a fabricated entity (unlike a truck, but like a metal ore) it's causation and result is a pure result of its own natural processes. Since it has no beginning, so far as anyone can tell, it's past cause must be a moment of mind.

Now, you might feel that mind arises because of neural activity of the brain and nervous system. You can believe that if you like, but there is no proof for this. If you do not accept that mind has material causes, then it must have a mental cause.

According to the Buddhist logical model, a person who does not accept a material cause for the mind (and in ancient India there were many people who asserted physicalism) must accept that mind has a mental cause. Since another mind cannot be the cause of our own mind (for all kinds of reasons) the only possible remaining alternative is that a previous moment of mind lead to this moment of mind in a serial continuity which has no beginning.

I do not find this at all convincing, because the same line of reasoning can be applied to a pickup truck, ie

Buddhists reject that the truck has a mental cause, and assert that it has a material cause, i.e. a previous moment of truck

The first moment of the truck's existence must be dependent on a previous truck-existence

Ergo, it is proven through inference that rebirth of pickup trucks is a valid teaching.

It is based on the logical notion of homogeneity between causes and effects.

So yes, this instance of a pickup truck is based on a previous instance of a pickup truck and not a honda or a mind.

The first moment of mind in this life therefore must be dependent on a previous moment of mind from the last life.

Nature of Mind to nature of Mind… There is reflection. Reflection means instantaneous sparks of awareness. It might last. It might not last. Mind to Mind transmission means that the nature of the teacher’s mind and the nature of the student’s mind are identical in that moment.[1] The noise produces the shock that creates the space in the mind for transmission to occur.

So someone said before that space is not a concern, but time is an issue and for that reason you can't learn from a recording. This is a mind-to-mind transmission, right? So, what if we compare it to telepathy (for kicks). If you accept the idea that someone can mentally "speak" to you, would you expect also that they could put that on tape for you to listen to later?

I know this isn't a brilliant point and has nothing to do with the three kayas and how transmission actually occurs, but if you think of it this way, it's not very hard to understand, imo.

[1] I got this from Aro website, which may or may not be suspect (I don't know), but this made sense to me.

Political causes and conditions?

If that is the case, then your argument should not be against Islam or Christianity as religions, but the historical-material-political forces which produce violence.

That would be a wise position: for example, the current instability in the Middle East therefore related to colonialism, the west's addiction to oil.......realist politics. Islam thus playing merely a rhetorical role in all of this. In which case, why are you attacking it, and not colonialism, American consumption and geo-political stategies?


Malcolm wrote:
Christianity and Islam are both based on an historical interpretation of the role of God in human history and lay claim to a unique and privileged position vis a vie divine sanction. Much of their respective theologies is organized around justifying their respective claims to empire based on a specific reading of history that stems from the divinely sanctioned ethnic cleansing found in the old testament.

Islam and Christianity both attempt to seal their dominance by declaring an end to divine revelation, thus securing themselves the position of final authority in all matters both religious and mundane.

Both C and I are reactions and accommodations to the Hellenization of the Ancient World.

As for your last point, I have and do attack "...colonialism, American consumption and geo-political stategies".

However, '...colonialism, American consumption and geo-political stategies" is just an outgrowth of the Western Spirit, and thus the endgame of Christian empire politics. The religious impulse driving these politics is not longer relevant, but the ethics and the precedents driving them are still in force because of protestant values that drove the rise of capitalism to begin with. Like monotheism, capitalism and communism are both hegemonic economic systems driven by economic imperatives which derive from the same religious psychology that drives their predecessors, Christianity and Islam.

The impulse to both religious and mundane empire is present in the Koran.

At least Christianity has been neutered by secularism. That was my point in the beginning. I still stand by that point. Why do you think Christian fundamentalists in the US are trying to put Christian theology back into the school system as "creationism" etc.? Fundamentalist Christians know their balls have been cut off by science. So they are trying to destroy science. Next step: The Theocratic States of America.

In Islam, širk (Arabic: شرك‎) is the sin of idolatry or polytheism. It refers to the deification of anyone or anything other than the singular God.[18] Shirk is also associating partners with him, giving his characteristics to others beside him, or not believing in his characteristics.[18][19]

Within Islam, širk is an unforgivable crime; God may forgive any sin except for committing širk.[18][20] It is the vice that is opposed to the virtue of tawhid, literally "declaring [that which is] one", often translated into the English term monotheism.[18][19]
As in the other Abrahamic religions, in practice the term has been greatly extended and may be used very widely within Islam to describe behaviour that is deprecated, including the use of images in a way that is seen as un-Islamic, but does not literally constitute worship.

For example, terming the Buddha omniscient is an example of "shirk".

So now a) can't leave Islam. Islam is a prison sentence for anyone born in a Muslim country. B) Buddhists and Hindus are all going to hell. Not even God can forgive us. Nice religion. Perfect control structure. if you can control people with their beliefs, you don't need external power structures.

Well, to be clear I'm not saying that rebirth is an optional part of the teaching.
I'm simply saying making it a bar to people being Buddhists is wrongheaded. As long as it remains part of the teachings, they will have to learn to live with it. In other words it's up to them and their practice. I have just never known a teacher being happy ever to come in and demand belief is all.[/quote]

Telling people that reject rebirth they are not really Buddhists is ok. But one cannot force anyone to believe anything. People believe whatever they want.

Because I'm afraid that I otherwise can't change my mind so easily since in the Precious Vase kun 'dus yid bzhin nor bu is mentioned in two places. Ironically (since you say I'm confusing GY with refuge), one is in the section on Mahayoga Guru yoga (p223) and there the note says to look in the section on refuge (p103). And there it doesn't say what you're saying at all, there is no mention of anything not related to Buddhadharma.

Next to that, Norbu Rinpoche said this many times, yes, but never have I heard him say to unify teachers not related to transmission. In fact I heard the opposite, that we don't have to unify for example our carpenter teacher.

The extension of that thinking may be found in the book zen at war which I think is still in  print.

A minority certainly. But Buddhists of lineage did support that thing.

Malcolm wrote:
I don't think they used the jataka tales to support their POV. Brian Victoria's book pretty clearly lays out how they perverted Buddhist teachings with a nihilist interpretation of Zen. This aberration has far more to do with Meiji restoration cultural instability than Buddhism per se. A better example for your thesis would have been the monastic wars of the 12th and 13th century in Japan.

In any event, such occurrences are notable exceptions.

For example, you earlier brought up Chinese Maitreya millennialism; again, this type of aberration is a huge exception and had more to do with Chinese culture than Buddhism.

Certainly Buddhist have engaged in waging wars, but I cannot think of a single historical example of Buddhist waging a religious war against non-Buddhists. Can you?

Qur'an
The Qur'an states that God (in Arabic, Allah) despises apostasy, with severe punishment to be imposed in the hereafter, but not mentioning explicitly any earthly penalty for apostates. Except 16:106-109, the verses that discuss apostasy all appear in surahs identified as Madinan, that is, they belong to the period when the Islamic state had been established, whereas traditional Islamic scholars have proposed that the prophet needed more time and/or power to legislate death as the penalty for apostasy.[citation needed]
The Qur'an contains verses from which it can be inferred that apostasy is not a capital offence.[33]
[edit]Sunni hadith
Examples of Sunni Hadiths that sanction the death penalty for apostasy include passages in the Sahih al-Bukhari include Sahih al-Bukhari, 9:83:17, Sahih al-Bukhari, 4:52:260, Sahih al-Bukhari, 9:84:57, Sahih al-Bukhari, 9:84:58 and Sahih al-Bukhari, 9:89:271.
The two most popular Hadiths usually cited by orthodox Islamic clerics to support the death penalty for apostates are:
"Allah's Apostle said, "The blood of a Muslim who confesses that none has the right to be worshipped but Allah and that I am His Apostle, cannot be shed except in three cases: In Qisas for murder, a married person who commits illegal sexual intercourse and the one who reverts from Islam (apostate) and leaves the Muslims."Sahih al-Bukhari, []
"Whoever changed his (Islamic) religion, then kill him" Sahih al-Bukhari, 9:84:57
[edit]Shia hadith
Some Shia Hadiths also sanction the death penalty for apostasy. For example, one of the shia Imams has been asked about a Muslim who has converted to Christianity, he answered "he should be killed not called to repent", and when asked about a Christian converting to Islam then converting back to Christianity, he answered "he should be given the chance to repent, otherwise killed" (Al-Kafi 7:257 | 10), (Men la Yahthuruh Al-Faqeeh (Whom an Islamic Cleric is not attending) 3:91 | 341), and (Tahtheeb Al-Ahkam (Rectification of the Rules) 10:140 | 554).[34]

I got these Tibetan medicine pills called Agar-35 and "Happiness of Mind." They are supposed to help balance everything out and put one in a calm state which is conducive to meditation, basically. They work gradually over time and it's not like you pop a pill to chill out. It balances pitta and whatever (I'm no doctor).

Check out these instructions: There are specific guidelines given in preparation for taking the idfferent Tibetan pill formulas and specifically the Precious Pills. Among these are that this pill should not be exposed to direct sunlight or bright artificial light, it should be taken on days with no extreme output of energy for three days prior to beginning and four days following taking the precious pill. Refrain from sex & excessive exercise, coffe or black/green tea or alcohol, red meat, eggs, shell fish, raw fruits or vegetables, fried, pungent or sour foods, smoking extreme hot or cold baths or showers. Mild intake of food, avoiding garlic, onion and black olive.

Prepare a room by blocking the windows and doors so that direct light cannot enter. A candle may be used for light when necessary. The night before, remove and crush the Precious pill or pills and then place in boiled water in a clean unchipped glass and cover with a white cloth and place it at your bedside allowing it to soak over night. On this evening it is particularly important to dress warmly and be warm during sleep. Early the next morning one should drink the mixture after stirring it thoroughly with the clean ring finger while reciting the Medicine Buddha Mantra. This should then be followed by drinking a cup of warm, boiled water. All the while not leaving the darkened room for twenty four hours. Bathroom should be darkened (candle is ok) when needed.

Reciting the Mantra of Medicine Buddha is suggested while opening and taking the medicine. The mantra is: Om Bekanzi  Bekanzi Maha Bekanzi Bekanzi Radza Samu Gate Soha! (phonetically  ~ OM beyconzee beyconzee Mawhaw Beyconzee Beyconzee Rawdza Sawmoo Gawtay Sohaw). Reciting this mantra 108 times in a series of seven times 7x108 is also recommended during this 24 hour period. A mala would be needed for this to help you count and keep track of the mantra count.

Remember when taking this precious pill it should be a time of deep rest and gentle meditative contemplation ~ this attitude will assist in the alchemy of healing involved.
I am supposed to take 2 pills a day of each over a long period of time, like a few months. Based on these instructions, that is something that could only possibly be achieved by people with no job or who are on a long vacation like a 3-month retreat (and hopefully it's a Medicine Buddha retreat).

Additionally, it seems the got the Medicine Buddha Mantra wrong, didn't they?
Here's the one I'm familiar with: Tayata Om Bekandze Bekandze Maha Bekandze Radza Samudgate Soha.
Here's there's: Om Bekanzi  Bekanzi Maha Bekanzi Bekanzi Radza Samu Gate Soha
I have bolded the differences. Google turns up no results at all for their version of the mantra.

My question for the doctors is: is this a bit extreme overkill here?
Agar-35 can be bought a few different places, so I assume some Tibetan Doctors are familiar with it, if there are any doctors here. I can't imagine a regular medicine such as this requires you to block a week off your calendar and 24 hours in a dark room every time you take a pill which you are supposed to take consecutively for a few months.

You cannot say the same of most Buddhist highest yoga tantric texts i.e. they are coded, not be taken literally, etc. Now, we can argue about whether they once were meant to be taken literally -- but it seems unlikely.

So, there is miles of difference between the false critiques of the trimondis and cherry picking statements out of the Koran and hadith that encourage violence against kaffirs like we Buddhists.

rig pa does have something to do with dran pa, actually.

For example, in this passage from the dgongs pa zang thal explanatory tantra:

For both of that, first, because memory (dran pa) arose, there no terror through panic or fear. Since vidyā (rig pa) recognized itself (rang ngo shes), there was no grasping to clarity. Since wisdom arose to vidyā, [12/a] it naturally formed as the dharmakāya. Since the energy of that wisdom arose in the ten directions, the sambhogakāya arose...

But this is not based on karma.

Further, clear memory arises through being moved by wind that rises in the basis that is not established as any sort of entity.  Vidya arises without being lifted by the vāyu of conceit. Since it is not moved by the wind that causes movement, objects and mind are not divided into two. Since it is not moved by the karmic vāyu, samsara does not develop.

There is a clear progression in the snying thig texts that describes first memory (dran pa), then rig pa, and in this case, this memory and knowledge is not involved in samsara in any way.

Just a quick question:

I sent an email last week to my local DC chapter about membership and the precious vase, but haven't received an answer yet. Does DC membership go through the local communities or do I have to send an email to an other higher gar?
I can't order the book until I am a member.

Thanks,

The problem is that you and mudra do not fully understand what term "awareness" really means in English. So therefore, you are stuck on an obsolete translation.

So, there is no point in further discussion.

As long as you understand what rig pa means for yourself, you can call rig pa "george".

Tashi delek,   

- If Awareness of the Natural State is seen, with  a non-egocentric mind, then this does belong to Fruition Rigpa. Fruition Rigpa is Awareness that has had a direct and stable experience of Emptiness.

- The mind of karma has an ego-centric mind, this does belong to path Rigpa. Path Rigpa has a mind which has intellectually understood emptiness and here does Rigpa mean, Inteligence.

Here is for me clear that Rigpa can be understood with the inteligence and the related knowledge OR be experienced which mean to be Aware of the Natural State.
Aware of that Natural State is not seeing that State as done with object and subject.

One special thing of the Natural State is that the Wisdom is self-emanating and is not caused like we know with an object and subject.
Emptiness is like we should know a not born case. So it is always without interruption there, but how do we experience that Awareness which is Yermed  with Emptiness. Is it intelectual Rigpa or Awareness Rigpa?

I can imagin myself that intelectual Rigpa can never be Aware or experience the lights of the 4 Lamps..........

Such a narrative requires a bizarre view of causality which demonstrates that all political actions (empires rising and falling etc) stem from texts, and not from an unbelievably complex and infinite chain of events (of which, ideas are only one element).


Malcolm wrote:
All it requires is an understanding that texts are products of cultures which then reinforce and support cultural norms. In a world where the there was only Islam, everyone would get along just fine.

No one is pretending that there were not interesting philosophers, physicians, historians and poets produced by Islamic high culture. Genocidal Hebrews also wrote the Song of Solomon.

Human cultures contain contradictions.

Some of those contradictions are deadly to cultures around them.

Rigpa on it; knowledge for schoolstudents. There are many Rigpa's and combinations.
In 'naked awareness' I see clear as emptiness and awareness.  Pure awareness as Rigpa here.
Maybe self-"arising" (already is) gnosis= empty awareness.

Ma Rigpa = state sentient being. (not knowing)
I think the linguistic meaning is less important. Also nature is not in text revealing.

Ah.

HI Muni:

One of the problems you will face if you insist on translating rigpa as a awareness, is that you will be able to differentiate Dzogchen, etc. from the hindus who are always waffling on about "pure awareness". In reality, "awareness" is a word in english which requires an object.

"Awareness is the state or ability to perceive, to feel, or to be conscious of events, objects or sensory patterns. In this level of consciousness, sense data can be confirmed by an observer without necessarily implying understanding. More broadly, it is the state or quality of being aware of something. In biological psychology, awareness is defined as a human's or an animal's perception and cognitive reaction to a condition or event."

I know you are not a native English speaker, and so you may not be tuned into usage of English terms. Awareness is always an awareness of something. The basis is not a something. If you are aware of the basis as a something, then you immediately fall into samsara. This is the problem with using the term awareness for rig pa.

Knowledge in the other hand is more ambiguous word in English which actually involves real philosophical issues hence the discipline of epistemology i.e. the study of knowledge qua knowledge.

Rig pa in every sense of the word as it is used in opposition to ma rig pa has to do with knowing as opposed to ignorance. Some have described as the intersection between belief and truth, or "a justified true belief."

In this case, rig pa is justified, because it is based on a personal experience, true, because that experience can be verified by anyone, and a belief because in this case personal experience has lead us to a state personal verification of something that before hand be merely believed.

Anyway, people are free to believe what they wish, justified or not. It is my belief, one I think justified and true, that the English word awareness is not an adequate translation of rig pa almost every case.

Ye shes is normally translated as wisdom or primordial wisdom, but some people these days, following John Pettite and Richad Baron are liking primordial awareness for this.

To me, "wisdom" was always very ambiguous, primordial awareness is much clearer.
