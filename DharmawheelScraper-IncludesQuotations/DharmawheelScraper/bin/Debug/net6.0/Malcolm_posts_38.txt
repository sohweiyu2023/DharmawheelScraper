The key words are "should one choose to inquire". Sadly, the more common condition is external inquiry into the external world for answers only, where the inner world is ignored,  is it not. Thus outer, inner, and non-dual realization is implied in realizing the nature of mind; while ignorance (marigpa) is the semi-static condition where the inquiry has failed. For example, meditation.

Malcolm wrote:
People do not even know they should inquire.

Many people seek inwardly for answers too, but not recognizing the right questions to ask, they come up with many incorrect answers.

If you want to know the secret guru, first you must discover the inner guru; and to discover that inner guru, a realized outer guru is indispensable.

People have a very huge misconception about gurus, particularly in Dzogchen teachings. No guru is going to hand you awakening in their hand, or pick out the perfect yidam for you to practice, or give you a tailor made path to buddhahood. But they can transmit their own knowledge of the teachings, and help you encounter your own state directly. A realized guru is indispensable in this case. In Dzogchen and Mahāmūdra, an unrealized guru, however, is a serial killer of disciples. An unrealized guru can set one back many lifetimes. An unrealized guru breaks their own samaya the minute they open their mouths.

There is no living tradition of the sTon mun (Chan) tradition which has survived in Tibet, though perhaps there is a vestigal remnant of it in the Kagyu Mahāmudra tradition.

However, the clearest explanation of these traditions as they existed in Tibet may be found in the The Lamp of the Eye of Dhyāna by Nubchen Sangye Yeshe. Here it is clearly explained with respect to sūtrayāna systems, the Chan tradition's view and practice is much superior to the Indian system of view and practice brought to Tibet as presented to the Tibetans by Kamalashila. Without this background, I am afraid Tibetan Zen will be rather obtuse.

As evidenced by the preservation of a debate in an 11th century text by Mañjusȓīkirti, there was a serious debate in the mid 8th century between Indian exponents of the tradition we now term "The Great Perfection" (Śrī Singha being mentioned by name) and a more gradualist style of Vajrayāna which came to be the normative position. However, echoes of the earlier Indian nongradual tradition may be found in some of the Mahāmudra dohas, especially those of Saraha. Klaus Dieter Mathis has done some remarkable work in this area.

Unfortunately, like the swastika, it is too late to rehabilitate socialism. As Orton writes in his essay above (italics mine):

No, socialism is too bound up with class hierarchy to even approach anarchism. Socialism is also a product of patriarchy, and bears the faults of it as well.

Again, depends on how you construe the label. Orton was right, in his time, to distance himself from the neoliberal atrocity that was then trying to pass for the socialist alternative.
I don't really agree with this assessment. Orton distanced himself from socialism for this reason, among others:
It seems to me that “socialism” or “ecosocialism”, as a description of a future deep ecology-inspired and socially just post-capitalist society, is not adequate or inspirational. The type of future ecocentric and socially just social formations is up for discussion. There are no worked out social models that can be simply adopted. Socialism is in many ways an expression of the industrial proletariat, and while its legacy of social justice remains valid, and indeed needed for a future ecocentric society, it is not correct to say that “ecosocialism” will describe the future post-industrial ecocentric society. The features of such a society are a work in progress for all of us to engage with.

There are few sets of eco-friendly political platforms in the West which might help foster a genuinely left movement that is also really and truly biocentric.

What eco-socialists and the Bookchinites fail to grasp and constantly criticize is the diversity of level 1 principles that can lead to a deep ecological perspective. Sarkar, Bookchin, and other materialist thinkers in the ecology movement devote/waste an enormous amount of time criticizing the spiritual and philosophical underpinnings of the deep ecological view, because of traditional left wing dogmatism and intellectual rigidity that continues to infect the materialist left to this day. They completely miss the point that how one arrives at one's ecological view is far less important than the fact that one has arrived at it, and thus they persistently act and behave in ways counterproductive to the ecological movement as a whole — it is for this reason and this reason alone the Green Parties are so ineffective.

And:
To determine the greatness of the total non-existence of buddhahood, if buddhahood and non-buddhahood are non-dual, why is one seeking? Determine there is nothing to seek. The yogins in whom such a meaning is present effortlessly abide on the undifferentiated stage of Samantabhadra. The undifferentiated stage of Samantabhadra is universal stage of all Buddhas.

Of course the opposite can also occur, but not under a capitalist economic system.

Anyway, if we are going to talk about advances in ecologically (more) sound power production, then the example par excellence is China, not Burlington Va.  China, of course, is socialist and quite clearly China has not moved in this direction due to a sudden upsurge in ecological consciousness, but merely because:  1.  Solar energy is now the cheapest energy.  2.  It has gotten to the point, in China, where nobody living in an urban environment (rich or poor, powerful or powerless) can breath.

It is an extremely important practice in the Sakya School, one which I did for many years. If you do this practice seriously, you will realize the actual meaning of Mahāmudra.

It also has a supplement, a pure vision of Dilgo Khyentse's where the sbags sgrub serves as the outer sadhana, as well as an inner and secret sadhana as well. This is included in Dilgo Khyentse's collected works.

Deep Ecology fizzled socially/politically after a short burst mainly because of it's inability to speak to human suffering directly, given it's main audience was humans, it failed to convince.

Malcolm wrote:
Greg, you are a little isolated on the island of yours.

Deep Ecology is not dead, not even slightly. There is Bill McKibben and the https://350.org/2016-annual-report/ in the US. If you think they are not a significant force, they have emerged as much more effective than the monkey wrenchers following Edward Abbey's vision. When you read pro-oil blogs and books, they constantly freak out at deep ecologists like McKibben, not social ecologists like Bookchin. Since Bookchin passed, the social ecology movement has faltered. Nevertheless, despite the deep misunderstanding of deep ecology by the socialist left, it is actually THE principle ecological voice today.

Grigoris said:
Social Ecology died in the ass too (especially) after the failed Green Party experiment in Germany and some other parts of the Western world.

Malcolm wrote:
The Green Parties have largely failed in because in the end party politics are, as Bharo, pointed out, blackholes that destroy life. Liberation Municipalism, Bookchin's most valuable contribution, has actually taken off in many (liberal) parts of the US. The fact that Burlington, VT runs on 100% renewable
electricity, for example, is a result of Vermonters taking Bookchin's ideas seriously and applying them to a small city.

Grigoris said:
I might add: unfortunately, as they were the only two visions that would have stopped (or slowed) humanity burning itself to death in a hellish fireball.

Malcolm wrote:
Personally, I think what is needed is a broad merging of Deep Ecology and Social Ecology/Libertarian Municipalism. Deep ecology, or rather Naess' ecosophy model specifically, provides the necessary philosophical framework needed for sustaining a broad, intellectually diverse, radical ecology movement; Bookchin's writings show a way out of the patriarchal social systems that have landed us in this mess to begin with.

The difficulty with Naess's writing is that they are not obviously systematic, and really require a lot of thought. If I fault Bookchin for anything, it is his insistence that we first must create a nonhierarchical society, and then deal with the issue of the environment — if only we had so much time! However, I think we can create nonhierarchical communities in an effort to meet his challenge. At the same time however, we must support Al Gore, McKibben, David Graber, and so on. At this point I am a bit loathe to lend my support the Green Party in the US, because they run a top down ship, and there is virtually no room for new leadership. Jill Stein also began to sound like crazy person during the election, repeating Russian agitprop taken from pro-Russian "anti-Atlantacist" right wing nutjobs like Richard Spencer and other Alt-right lunatics.

Orton's piece was written a few years ago, and it seems to me that he is familiar mostly with the American scene. Also, he uses a very narrow definition of ecosocialism.

Lots and lots of people within European socialist movements of various stripes have been becoming more and more enthusiastic about degrowth. What might have initially seemed like a momentary "deviation" has turned out to be a steady and lasting tendency. In France for example it is already pretty much part of the mainstream left:

https://www.thenation.com/article/could-leftist-jean-luc-melenchon-win-the-french-presidency/

Malcolm wrote:
Mélenchon is just an old school leftist. The old left is precisely what Orton is criticizing. Even Bookchin departed from his old left roots in the formation of his libertarian municipalism (with which I am sympathetic, but think it is too anthropocentric), despite his trenchant materialism. Frankly, I have not seen an ecosocialist analysis that goes beyond Saral Sarkar's ecological dictatorship of the proletariat.

Greg brought up the issue of not romanticizing First Nations. This is a very good point. But he also misses something in the sturm and drung of people freaking out over the Deep Ecological observation that our planet has exceeded our carrying capacity. 1) Wild animal populations plummeted 58% between 1970 and 2002. Only 15% percent of the land mass of the planet has been set aside for reserves.

At population levels circa 1780, human beings still largely lived within nature. This is not to argue that the impact of human being has never been felt before in history. Obviously the desertification of North Africa, the Middle East, up into the Gobi Desert in Central Asia, and so on are a direct impact of human social and economic activity. It is speculated that the epidemics that wiped out indigenous people in the Americas led to a period of global cooling, because there was a marked decrease in slash and burn agriculture. But the point is that we were no where near exceeding the carrying capacity of the planet.

We should also take into consideration that humans have managed our environment for countless millennia. Is any of this inconsistent with Deep Ecology? Of course not. The most distressing fable I hear from its detractors is that ecological management is incompatible with the goals of Deep Ecology (by which I mean the discipline put forth by Arne Naess, and not the Primitivism mentioned by Greg— these two are frequently confused).

The fundamental expression of Naess's thought is the idea that ecological thinking fosters self-realization:

treehuggingoctopus said:
Self-preservation, or in our terminology, self-realization, cannot develop far without sharing joys and sorrows with others or, more fundamentally, without the development of the narrow ego of the small child into the comprehensive structure of a Self that comprises all human beings. The ecological movement—like many earlier philosophical movements—goes a step further and asks for a deep identification of individuals with all life.

Malcolm wrote:
Naess, Arne (2009-05-01). The Ecology of Wisdom: Writings by Arne Naess (pp. 172-173). Counterpoint. Kindle Edition.

Here, Naess is asking us to extend the boundaries of our self-identification from human beings, or our nation, or our state, neighborhood, or tribe, to all of life in all its diversity. This kind of thinking is completely absent from ecosocialist thought, indeed, Sarkar makes a sustained argument for anthropocentrism.

Bookchin's point of view is much better, he writes:

treehuggingoctopus said:
Thus, unlike most deep ecologists, social ecologists understand that until we undertake the project of liberating human beings from domination and hierarchy — not only economic exploitation and class rule, as orthodox socialists would have it — our chances of saving the wild areas of the planet and wildlife are remote at best.

Malcolm wrote:
http://climateandcapitalism.com/2012/02/15/anthropocentrism-versus-biocentrism-notes-on-a-false-dichotomy/

Nevertheless, Bookchin unfairly characterizes deep ecologists. Naess writes:

treehuggingoctopus said:
At the end of this century we see a convergence of three areas of self-destructiveness: the self-destructiveness of war, the self- destructiveness of exploitation and suppression among humans, the self-destructiveness of suppression of non-human beings, and of degradation of life conditions in general. The two first gave rise to the global peace movement and the global social justice movement, the third gave rise to the much younger global movement, that of deep ecology.

Malcolm wrote:
http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/view/431/706

We see that Naess explictly acknowledges Bookchin's point:

treehuggingoctopus said:
So far as I can understand, all-round maturity of humans facilitates acts of identification with every kind of living being. This again facilitates negative attitudes towards wanton limitation of the fulfilment of life potentialities of such beings. When manifest exploitation and suppression are performed a reason is demanded: are they necessary for the satisfaction of vital needs of humans? The deepening and widening of the human ecological self results in increasingly limiting its own realization, when exploitation and suppression are applied. Potentialities of self-realization are destroyed. In this sense the third movement seeks to reduce the self-destructiveness of present globally relevant human behavior.

Malcolm wrote:
http://trumpeter.athabascau.ca/index.php/trumpet/article/view/431/706

In this speech, Naess clearly acknowledges the need for social justice, and the elimination of dominance and hierarchy within human populations. He does not consider this to be to be main thrust of the radical ecology movement. But he considers the three movements he mentions— the anti-war movement, the social justice movement, and the radical ecology movement — to be moving in the same direction, ultimately with the same goal. He continues:

treehuggingoctopus said:
The self-destructiveness of present policies seems clear to a great many, and it has been adequately formulated,but 'to turn the tide' seems politically overwhelmingly difficult. The self- destructiveness of wars has been announced clearly since the atomic bomb changed 'everything'. The long range self- destructiveness of large scale exploitation and suppression based on race, sex, or dominant economy are by now gradually seen to undermine the exploiters or suppressors themselves. (The false masculinity has crippled the male sex.)

Malcolm wrote:
In short, I argue ecosocialists such as Sarkar have in no way transcended their Marxist roots, that they insist on an economic dictatorships which in the end will only escalate into the kind of situation we had in Soviet Union, where, as McLaughlin writes, "Ecology was also seen as reactionary because it cast doubt on the view that socialism could and should transform nature." (pg. 52, Regarding Nature).

Anotehr problem is that most people, like Greg for example, take Deep Ecology as interpreted by David Forman to truly representative of Deep Ecology in toto. It is not.

Malcolm, after a night's rest, here is my response going back to the OP, that in essence, there is no difference in result.

Wholeheartedly recognizing and being absorbed into our innate buddhanature, the nature of mind, mind’s essence, or ultimate bodhicitta, etc, is essentially the same, in essence.

Ultimate reality (no-thingness) is incomplete if viewed as *apart from* phenomena in the non-dual context of interdependence by definition. Svabhavikakaya is all inclusive where subsummation heals all apparent rends. Yes, it is through breaking through the veil of illusion that the noble truths are read.

Rainbow Light bodies, wisdom bodies, sambhogakayas, yidams, yogic illusory bodies, cannot manifest independent from Dharmakaya (Dharmabody), just as phenomena are not to be separated from Dharmadhatu (Dharmata) -- such act as buddha’s self-radiant vehicles.

It may be worthwhile to contemplate what Vairochana studied in Shang Shung and Khotan, why he was exiled to the region of the “great Chinese mountain”, and the lives of Sri Singha, Manjushrimitra, and Vimalamitra in this regard, or not. Perhaps, it seems that you have already done this work? Breaking apart and breaking through, my tea is waiting.

It seems to this ignorant reader that much of history is unclear and that the Dunhuang excavations have brought forward an undiluted syncretism that has been ignored or forgotten in traditional circles. Of course, I may be wrong to speculate.

“O son of good family
If you wish to see the continuity
Of naked awareness
Then focus on absolute awareness as the object
Press the points of the body
Close the way of going and coming
Focus on the target
Rely on the unmoving
And grasp the vast expanse.”

The Tibetan naga literature comes from a variety of sources, there is a mass of lore, and there is no Naga Encyclopedia that has all the answers in a consistent way. Furthermore, naga mythology from India, etc. was overlaid onto the pre-existing Tibetan concepts of the klu (lu), which usually referred to ill-defined subterranean powers, not necessarily serpents. The two cannot be seen as simply the same, although they have been running in harness for so long it is difficult to separate the concepts derived from the two sources.

Malcolm wrote:
There is at least one encyclopedic source in Tibetan: the klu 'bum dkar nag khra gsum. Granted, these volumes, which belong to the Bon school, show considerable evidence of Indian overlay, but they also contain tons of native Tibetan lore.

According to Bon text, the klu 'bum dkar po (White Volume of the Nāgās), the nāgas are the offspring of the union of the king of the Gnyan, Gnyan spar ba Dung mgo g.yu’i thor tshugs (The gNyan Flying Conch Head with Turquoise Topknot) with the Sa bdag bstan ma, Gser mdog gser gyi bum pa can (The Golden One with a Vase of Gold).

You refer to such a "guru" as a "master". What has such a "guru" truly mastered in regards to embodying the dharma if he acts in such a manner?

Malcolm wrote:
The term "master" has two connotations: 1) one who has mastered a subject or a body of knowledge and 2) someone who has been given or taken authority of some portion of another person's life choices.

In equipoise on emptiness, there is no separate mind to find that is different from its emptiness at all. According to you, emptiness is something other than the mind. This is a very mistaken idea.

Ungern finally achieved his goal of power over Mongolia–but only briefly. After a long and complicated series of wars against various Chinese and Russian armies, he restored the Bogd Khan to the throne of Mongolia on February 22, 1921, but he was just a figurehead ruler. Ungern held power from March 13 until August 20. His short reign was pretty brutal. Ungern hated Jews and had what few Jews he could find in Mongolia rounded up and executed. ...Ungern’s number was up when the Reds counterattacked in summer 1921. As it turned out he wasn’t as brilliant a military commander as Genghis Khan. An ill-advised foray across the Russian border sapped Ungern’s forces, and under the pressure of another Bolshevik attack a revolt by his own men ultimately caused the collapse of his fragile dictatorship. The “Mad Baron” was captured by Soviet forces, interrogated, given the courtesy of a trial that lasted all of six hours, and then faced a firing squad on September 15, 1921.

A nonaffirming negation is the direct negation of something that does not exist at all, in this case, essences. When we negate essence, we are not affirming the existence of anything else.

Negative actions are wholly attended by the six afflictive mental factors that all beings in the desire realm who have afflictive minds possess. This is not a "projection."

The unconditioned cannot be a direct object of the mind. It can only be inferred by the mind. Unconditioned space is an absence of obstruction. It cannot be directly perceived. Cessation is the absence of a cause. It also cannot be perceived directly. Likewise, emptiness— the absence of inherent existenc in your preferred parlance— cannot be directly perceived. All three of these types of unconditioned phenomena (there are no others in Buddhadharma) can only be inferred.

Therefore, the emptiness meditated upon below the path of seeing is merely a conceptual stand in for actual emptiness. The emptiness meditated above the path of seeing is not an object of the mind, since it is actual emptiness. That meditation is a nonmeditation because it is completely free from all objectification.

As to the first point, there is clearly a power differential — an "abbot" holds a position of power. That power can be abused. In cases where an abbot preys on celibate(!) female students for his own pleasures, it is clearly a violation of ecclesiastical authority.

As to the second point, since the power differential is real, it compromises these women's freedom to consent.

As to the third point, sexual abuse, whether womanizing or human trafficking, is not culturally relative. It is part of a continuum of abusive patriarchal relations and power structures that renders women in this world second class citizens in most of the world, and vulnerable to predation by men. This is no less true in the West than it is in the East. It needs to be said that patriarchy injures men too, and is the fundamental set of social relations which has brought the climate to its knees under capitalism.

Frankly, the status of women is still very low in Tibetan Buddhism. Tibetan teachers, on the whole, are still very sexist and patriarchal.

I suggest you look into the work of Karma Lekshey Tsomo, etc. One of the main terms in Tibetan for women is skyes dman, lower birth. This view is so endemic that the chapters on women's health in the medicine tantras begin:
Because of inferior merit, one obtains the body of a women... female illness in the end become fourteen extra [diseases] for woman because their birth is lower.

I don't doubt it, and neither do I condone it.  I said that a teacher coming from this cultural mileu will have very different standards to those encountered in some Western countries and this inevitably will lead to conflict.  I fail to see what is so controversial about that.[/quote]

When in Rome, do as the Romans. The onus is on Tibetan teachers to discover what kind of culture they intend to spread Dharma in. If they are not up to changing their views, adapting their teachings to the situation they find in the West, they should just stay home. Most people do not realize that nunneries in India and Tibet are major refuges for women fleeing human trafficking and the sex trade. These women take up vows because they are tired of being sexually exploited. You need to read up on the very real inequality Tibetan and Himalayan women face under Buddhism (among other nations like Thailand).

When Lamas come to the West, and then begin having sexual relationships with women in their Sanghas, womanizing, getting them pregnant, forcing them to have abortions on the pain of self-exile back to India, refusing to speak with them after they have decided to end the affair, and so on, this is completely wrong and we should not stand for it.

I personally have no problem with Tibetan Lamas meeting a female student and then having a serious relationship with them where they are accorded personal respect as befits them as human beings. There are some good examples of such partnerships. But women are becoming increasingly suspicious of Tibetan Lamas, rightly so, and this is a problem for the flourishing of the Dharma in the West.

As to your oft repeated cultural relativism: Tibetan women do not enjoy and they do not like the sexism in their culture.

Tibetans in general do not like it when Lamas womanize. They consider it vulgar and unseemly. Such lamas do not attract large followings in Tibetan culture in general. The fact that some lamas come to the west and get away with this behavior has more to do with the fact that they were able to get away with it here where they could not possibly get away with this in the tight knit communities in Tibet and the Himalayas, as well as exile communities. Drukpa Kunley's are few in Tibetan culture. Most people cannot be Drukpa Kunley.

But this still does not resolve the dilemma of whether emptiness is conditioned or unconditioned.

Malcolm wrote:
Emptiness is the unconditioned nature of things. There are no appearances that are not conditioned and dependently arisen, therefore, there is no need to bracket appearance/emptiness as something distinct from dependent origination/emptiness, they are the same thing.

Why do we say emptiness is unconditioned? No one made emptiness, no one can increase emptiness, no one can decrease emptiness, no one can destroy emptiness. You might argue, well, what is the emptiness of a thing that has ceased to exist? Does that emptiness exist or not? If the emptiness of a given thing is conditioned, one should be able to describe how it arose. Merely stating that a thing's emptiness arose with the arising of thing itself is not adequate. When a thing perishes there is no need to discuss the nature of a nonexistent. When we examine the meaning of emptiness, we find that emptiness refers to the absence of four extremes of being in phenomena. Since all phenomena are free from four extremes, emptiness is therefore unconditioned.

But my point was different, and still stands: our gurus need to be realistic about who we are as well. And we are, most or at least great many of us, deeply troubled persons. We are not Tibetans, and we do not fit the profile of who becomes a good Dharma practitioner in Tibet or India -- those who go into Buddhadharma there would probably strive to be good Christians here. Most of us "Western" Buddhists are broken people who are ill at home in our culture, very often in our family, and pretty much always with ourselves.

Now take the leader and put him in a Western nunnery.  The girls there are not young and naieve, most of them are adults with life experience.  They are not reliant on their practice in order to live.  They do not have the social pressure to remain.  They have been brought up in a culture where not only is sexual abuse not acceptable, but it is illegal. Etc...

Sounds like a recipe for disaster, right?  A ticking bomb waiting to go off.

But this idea that somehow there is this massive power imbalance (like there is in the first example), well, quite clearly there is not.  If it were a university or a school and one's future survival depended on getting through, getting high grades, etc...  Well, yes, then there is some tangible pressure.

Most American women I have discussed this with consider this a real problem, and all have been inappropriately approached on one occasion or another by lamas, monastic and and nonmonastic.

If you hold all three sets of vows, the higher vows trump the lower ones if they appear to conflict. According to the Bodhisattva yana the crucial aspect of an action is the motivation. By responding to the suffering of others with compassionate action stemming from pure motivation, that does not indicate any failure of refuge vows, because it's keeping one's Bodhisattva vows. To imply otherwise will lead others astray on a Mahayana forum.
Even 10th level Bodhisattvas take Refuge from their own unawareness. if you hold all three sets of vows, the higher vows trump the lower ones if they appear to conflict.

How do klesavarana and jneyavarana work in Dzogchen? If Dzogchen is a single state, is it innately free from both, such that one is entirely free of all obscuration so long as one is in rigpa? If so, then how is there any state of being free of klesavarana but not yet jneyavarana? If not, then how does it work?

Malcolm wrote:
Dzogchen is a uniform state. When it is recognized that is vidyā, rigpa; when it is not, that is avidyā, ma rig pa. The two obscurations exist when we are in a state of ma rig pa, ignorance.

Ma rig pa itself is the basis knowledge obscuration from which the obscuration of afflictions arises.

There is actually a difference in the object: sūtra emptiness is the coarse emptiness, realized by a coarse, analytical mind. Vajrayāna emptiness is a subtle emptiness, realized by a subtle, nonanalytical mind.

There is no difference in the object, what is different is the mind that is realising emptiness. The meaning of emptiness is the same whether it is being realised by a gross mind or by the mind of clear light.

Sherab said:
It is possible to talk sensibly of emptiness as an object for a subject?  If so, what are we to make of the inseparability of clarity and emptiness?

Clarity and emptiness are isolates of the mind: when we experience the clarity of the mind, we seal it with emptiness; when we experience emptiness, we seal it with clarity.

There is the possibility of infinite voids even if this refers to a way of classifying phenomena. I do not know if it is written somewhere in the Mahayana sutras, but comparing the lists of prajnaparamita, yogachara and Patisambhidamagga, such a conclusion seems plausible. The practice of looking into the sky, by the way, is partly from the Prajnaparamita sutras.

CHRISTOPHER HATCHEIL Naked Seeing  said:
Then, Sakra, the lord of the gods, asked the venerable
Subhuti: “Noble Subhuti! When one practices yoga in this Perfection
of Wisdom, on what does one practice yoga?”
Subhuti replied: “Kausika! When one practices yoga in this
Perfection of Wisdom, one practices yoga in space.  Kaurika!
Someone wishing to train and practice yoga in this Perfection of
Wisdom should practice yoga in [a place] without cover.”

But if the experience of an object is dependent on the mind experiencing it, doesn't that make the object conditioned?

Malcolm wrote:
Emptiness is not really an object, it is the state of things. In sutra, emptiness is arrived at inferentially. The so called "direct perception of emptiness" is in every respect the absence of the perception of substantiality in/of things. This absence of perception is in fact an inference below the path of seeing in sūtra as well as Dzogchen, Mahāmudra, and so on.

The difference lies in whether or not the nature of the mind is directly pointed out. In sūtra it is not, and in Vajrayāna it is — gradually, in the case of Mahāmudra, or all at once, as in the case of Dzogchen.

I'll go by the eight senior signatories who composed the letter to Sogyal outlining the harm and abuse. I am going to trust their account, as they are the closest to him and have seen and witnessed his actions and the results of his actions. They are also long-term Dharma practitioners and are best placed to make a judgement.

Here is what they said to Sogyal in their reply to him. I've already quoted this, but it's worth quoting again. They actually deal directly with this point:

Grigoris said:
Like I said:  "I think our vision is too obscured to be able to make the necessary judgments without falling prey to aversion and attraction."

I am not going to deny that it SEEMS that there is abuse.

TRC said:
Ours might be, but not the eight senior signatories of the letter, or for that matter those who have been abused. They might actually know if they have suffered actual harm.


Malcolm wrote:
"Harm" is subjective, that's why we have courts. If Sogyal was a monk, the standard would be more clear. He isn't, he is a layperson, and since this is a religious organization rather than the professional one, professional standards that apply to physicians, etc., may not apply. Then there is the issue of EU law. This is why I council that the Rigpa students need to take matters into their own hands, ala Kripalu.

TRC said:
n 1994, revelations surfaced of sexual relationships between Desai and several female ashram residents. When these and other alleged abuses of power were confirmed, Kripalu’s Board of Trustees called for Desai’s immediate resignation. Since 1994, and continuing today, there is no formal relationship between Kripalu and Desai.

The mind that apprehends emptiness is held to be more subtle in Vajrayāna -- at least this is how the Gelugpas explain the difference.

Does this mean we shouldn't talk about it of course not but we should all practice noble speech and stress repeatedly that there are excellent teachers.

I can't even imagine how horrible it would be if we didn't have teachers like Ajaan Thanissaro, Bhikkhu Bodhi, Bhikkhu Analayo, Ajahn Amaro, Shōhaku Okumura Roshi, Shoryu Bradley, Mahasi Sayadaw & Sayadaw U Pandita, or Luang Por Chah!

Without these heavy weights that have been supported solely by lay people and have been able to deeply explore, draw out content, develop teaching and practices, and help guide many of us in different situations the Dhamma may be very hard in some senses to develop and or get started on.

Though these teachers are also pretty amazing examples.  Usually live incredibly modestly (Some robes and a bowl) and in the Zen masters I mentioned one lives off the grid.

If it is just a matter of seeking sexual partners, everyone involved presumably is a consenting adult. Whether it is liberating activity or just sex is not something we actually have the capacity to perceive with our limited samsaric vision. If Sogyal was forcing his women student to have abortions after he impregnated them, for example, then this would be entirely different, of course.  Therefore, this is none of our business, in absence of other information.

Physical assualt is a criminal act, either a misdemeanor or a felony depending on how severe the resulting harm. A punch in the stomach is likely a misdemeanor unless there is some damage to an organ.  However, the proper forum adjudicating this is the courts, not DW. Hence my observation that Sogyal has become the OJ of Tibetan Buddhism.

This is not a court of law. You are free to choose not to speak out about the bad behaviour of your coreligionists. It is not the moral high ground you are presenting it as, however. I have first hand experience of the obstacles this kind of depravity can put in the way of new and potential Buddhists. While you choose not to speak of it, you have had the same experience with friends of yours (as you have shared). There have already been several out-of-court settlements for large sums of money made by Sogyal/Rigpa to his accusers. This is not mere rumour. or gossip.

After consideration and reflection I will continue to speak out about what I see as wrong. At least the conversation here is not devolving to talking about lizard creatures and Big Pharma poisoning the water and our food supply, or opining that the reason people have a problem with this fiasco is that they don't like Asian men sleeping with white women like that other Vajrayana forum.

Malcolm wrote:
I am not claiming any moral high ground at all. I am simple observing that no one here is in possession of facts. All we have is allegations of misconduct and one or more settlements out of court (which are not admissions of guilt). I would also observe that truly unethical teachers are rarely, if ever, "brought down" by "outing" them. I have no opposition to his students releasing their letter. However, the perseveration, speculations, moral indignation, and pointless gossip present in this thread serves no one.

No one can put obstacles in front of new Buddhists (are there any in truth?), including a bad teacher. If we make a connection with a bad teacher, that is on us. That is our karma. We learn from that experience and move on. We all have lived many lifetimes, and have done many worse things in our past lives than Sogyal's accusers allege against him. When criticizing others it is useful to maintain a multi-life perspective about oneself. And of course there is Angulimala.

The tone of this thread is rather WASPy, and not very Buddhist at all. I am not defending Sogyal, incidentally. My point is completely different. And if in the end Sogyal is actually guilty of all these alleged misdeeds, he will suffer the result of his own karma. Karma is unerring.

With all due respect, if this fat, abusive Sogyal prick was a Mormon we would all be going on about how degenerate the Mormon religion is and not hemming and hawing about whether he "has realization".

I am sorry, but all of the equivocation on this is not good for Tibetan Buddhism in the West. The ridiculous level of sexism and misogyny in Tibetan culture has to stop, if not in Tibet and the diaspora, then certainly among western practitioners. This is not a case of he said/she said. There are years of reports from some of his closest students that substantiate Sogyal's abusive, predatory behaviour.

If we can't draw clear lines against behaviour like that, it is no wonder that western sanghas with a few exceptions are the domain of aging hippies and GenX'ers. Even if this alleged tulku has the realization to carry on like this without harm to himself, he is clearly harming others. I mean, Jesus H. Christ have we learned nothing from the Osel Tenzin fiasco? This is not a difficult topic.

What would we say about abusive Catholic priests molesting young boys? That it was OK because it brought the boys closer to God? Give me a break.

Whether you are Sogyal Lhakar, Younge Khachab or Osel Tenzin if you can't keep your pants on, don't call yourself a Dharma teacher.

Statements like these mean nothing. Only buddha can see realization of others.

kirtu said:
Only a Buddha can accurately or possibly directly know the realization of others.  But Shantideva clearly says "where there is smoke, there is fire (in a positive way).  Although we are personally afflicted we can examine the good qualities of others and infer some level of realization (or not).  Secondly there are other guidelines and these were apparently used in the mid 1800's by Jamgon Kongtrul and Janmyang Khyentse Wangpo to evaluate each other's levels of realization (probably initiated on the part of JKW).

Could someone with some knowledge on the topic of Samaya (Malcolm?) please be so kind and say a few words to clear up the following?

1) We're harming Samaya by exposing our Guru after we've have been sexually or physically abused by him

Malcolm wrote:
It is a delicate subject and should be treated with care. Simply finding that you do not like a guru after all, and feel he or she is not being super nice to oneself and meeting one's expectations is not a grounds for "outing" a guru. In our culture we are overly sensitive about being respected. If you wanted to sleep with your guru, and then found out they have other partners, that is your problem. If on the other hand you or someone you know are physically damaged by a teacher, sexually assaulted/raped, or subjected to clear psychological abuse, this may be sufficient grounds for exposing a teacher.

A lot of so called "guru abuse" is a co-created problem where students lose their perspective and feed a guru's ego, the latter in turn begin to feel invincible, and there is kind of snowball effect of ego inflation: the student feels their master is enlightened, the master begins to believe student mythology, and then the master loses perspective. In this case, students really need to reflect on their own role in their own "abuse" in terms of how much they were involved in inflating their master's ego in order to inflate their own. In short, it may be a practice to view our guru as enlightened, but we really should not keep telling them that over and over again. If our guru is truly realized, it will be evident when they die. Until then, it is best to maintain a balanced perspective and keep good boundaries.

If our guru is a truly harmful being, it is they who are breaking samaya and not we. They cannot repair samaya they break with their students. We can always repair our samaya with respect to all our teachers.

It is very perilous to be a guru. It is a great responsibility. And, it is the case that sometimes flawed gurus generate a great deal of benefit for the majority of their students, at the expense of a few.

With respect to the Sogyal affair, I have no personal opinion about the matter which I choose to share, apart from my comment about his letter. I was not there, I did not see what happened, and in this country, America, accusations are not sufficient proof to convict, despite movies, testimonies, and so on. I am afraid that Sogyal is now something like the OJ Simpson of Tibetan Buddhism, his letter is the white bronco, and one's opinion of his guilt or innocence depending on which side of the ethnic/traditionalist divide you stand.

One thing to bear in mind is that Sogyal has had a huge hand in introducing thousands of western students to luminaries like Dilgo Khyentse and so on, whom they otherwise may have never met or would have had great difficulty receiving teachings from. His book, whether personally authored or ghostwritten, has been a major introduction to Tibetan Buddhism for hundreds of thousands of people. Like any person living in a democracy, he deserves the right to a fair trial, not the incessant sniping on the internet to which he has been subjected for decades. If someone has a criminal or civil complaint, they should file it in the French Courts. Otherwise, this is all hearsay, and hearsay bears no legal weight whatsoever. If he is not doing anything for which he may held criminally or civilly liable, one may find his lifestyle and choices distasteful and disturbing, but it is also none of one's business. One is not obligated to participate in his Sangha.

Hi all,

I have only been reading about Dzogchen for the last 6 weeks and with the transmission coming up, i have doubts whether or not i'm ready to receive it.

I am nearly through the GuruYoga book and have the worldwide transmission dvd to practice with, but with such little time to develop the practice, i'm stuck wondering whether or not i should participate in the event.

As for understanding Dzogchen ( the basics ) i'm still very much in my infancy and for me i kind of feel like i should be focusing more on developing both the guru practice ( to receive correctly not to develop it in the same way as after the transmission ) and gain a little deeper into my understanding of the structure and basic theory of it.

Whats your thoughts on this, should i keep studying non restricted content and develop the mantras and movements of GuruYoga or do i go ahead with the upcoming transmission with very little understanding of it's structure and little practice of the event itself?

The reason why i ask is that im getting mixed signals on the topic, some people are saying get it done because his health is getting worse and from what im getting from the books iv read is, the student understands the theory of it and practices the event in order to be able to have the capacity to receive it.

Thank you

The path of a bodhisattva is not defined by one or more of the expedient means that bodhisattva employs but:

Wisdom is the bodhisattva's mother,
expedient means his father;
of those who guide and teach all beings,
there are none not born of these.

"
Here, Sariputra, a Bodhisattva, a great being, having stood in the perfection of wisdom, by way of not taking his stand on it, should perfect the perfection of giving, by way of seeing that no renunciation has taken place, since gift, giver, and recipient have not been apprehended.  He should perfect himself in the perfection of morality, through not transgressing into either offence or non-offence.    He should perfect the perfection of patience and remain imperturbable.  He should perfect the perfection of vigour, and remain indefatigable in his physical and mental vigour.  He should perfect the perfection of meditation, and derive no enjoyment (from transic meditation).  He should perfect the perfection of wisdom, on account of the fact that he apprehends neither wisdom nor stupidity.
"
From Chapter 2 THE THOUGHT OF ENLIGHTENMENT of The Large Sutra on Perfect Wisdom

"
Subhuti : If, O Lord, form should be seen as empty of form, etc. to: enlightenment as empty of enlightenment, how can of a Bodhisattva who courses in perfect wisdom the coursing take place?
The Lord : A noncoursing is the bodhisattva’s coursing in perfect wisdom.
Subhuti : For what reason?
The Lord : Because no perfect wisdom can be apprehended, no Bodhisattva, no coursing, no one who courses, nor that whereby or wherein he courses.  It is thus that a Bodhisattva’s coursing in perfect wisdom is a noncoursing in which all these discoursings are not apprehended.

When I took my formal refuge ceremony, at Nan Tien Temple, in 2005, one of the points I particularly noticed in the vows, was to avoid 'reliance on rites and rituals.' It struck me as a little incongruent, as what I was engaged in was indeed 'a rite', namely, the rite of taking refuge. I read this again the other day while studying a Dharma text - that the bodhisattva is to avoid reliance on rites and rituals. But Buddhism has its rituals  - even a daily meditation is a ritual, or so it seems to me. And as I understand it, life in many Buddhist monasteries is a constant succession of recitations which I would have thought were 'rites'?

So, what do I make of this apparent discrepancy between principle and practice, if indeed it is? Is there a difference between chanting the Buddhist precepts, and what is considered a rite or ritual?

Lopon Tenzin Namdak: From Bonpo Dzogchen Teachings,

Both the Buddhist and the Bonpo teachings are divided into Sutra, Tantra, and Dzogchen. Each of these three systems has a different Base, a different Path, and thus they lead to a different Fruit or result. The method proper to the Sutra system is the path of renunciation (spong lam), the method proper to the Tantra system is the path of transformation, (sgyur lam), and the method proper to Dzogchen is the path of self-liberation, (grol lam).

I would argue that the lack of insight on the emptiness of all phenomena is what enable a grasping at a self.  If there is insight on emptiness, there will be no grasping at a self.

Malcolm wrote:
It is called connate ignorance in other teachings than Dzogchen because sentient beings do not recognize the nature of their own minds, inseparable clarity and emptiness. The way the Sakypas frame this, for example, is because the emptiness of the mind is not recognized, this causes nirvana. Because the clarity of the mind is not recognized, this causes samsara. Because their inseparability is not recognized, this is the source of the misperception of self. So, it is not simply a matter of lacking insight into emptiness alone. It is a matter of not recognizing the nature of the mind in its totality. The Dzogchen account, given above, is very different. The Sakya theory has another interesting twist— they identify tathāgatagarbha as the inseparability aspect of inseparable clarity and emptiness because clarity and emptiness are themselves extremes to be avoided.

Sherab said:
It looks as if you use "connate" here to mean "inherent" or inborn.  Whereas when you use "connate" in relation to Dzogchen, you appear to mean "co-emergent" or "arising simultaneously".  Am I understanding you correctly?

When one talks of extremes, one normally talks of polar opposite.  Therefore I find it strange that Sakya theory considers clarity and emptiness as polar opposites.  A combination of polar opposites i.e. extremes, if at all possible, simply gives rise to a third extreme.

Malcolm wrote:
Connate means connate, not innate.

It is not the case that clarity and emptiness are polar opposites, they are inseparable, but as I said, "the emptiness of the mind is not recognized, this causes nirvana. Because the clarity of the mind is not recognized, this causes samsara. Because their inseparability is not recognized, this is the source of the misperception of self."

These are three aspects to the nature of the mind, also termed the all-basis. You can consult any  text on Lamdre.

And of course, I have no idea if any present day Longde practitioners are going to attain rainbow body either, even though ChNN's revival of Longde in Longsal is a very important development. All we can expect, as practitioners of recent terma cycles, is that the samayas in these lineages are pure and thus the teachings will be very, very effective for their practitioners.

Grasping at a self is the fundamental perceptual error plaguing sentient beings. It is connate. It has always been there.

Sherab said:
I would argue that the lack of insight on the emptiness of all phenomena is what enable a grasping at a self.  If there is insight on emptiness, there will be no grasping at a self.

Malcolm wrote:
It is called connate ignorance in other teachings than Dzogchen because sentient beings do not recognize the nature of their own minds, inseparable clarity and emptiness. The way the Sakypas frame this, for example, is because the emptiness of the mind is not recognized, this causes nirvana. Because the clarity of the mind is not recognized, this causes samsara. Because their inseparability is not recognized, this is the source of the misperception of self. So, it is not simply a matter of lacking insight into emptiness alone. It is a matter of not recognizing the nature of the mind in its totality. The Dzogchen account, given above, is very different. The Sakya theory has another interesting twist— they identify tathāgatagarbha as the inseparability aspect of inseparable clarity and emptiness because clarity and emptiness are themselves extremes to be avoided.

What is short answer for grasping at a self in Dzogchen teachings?

Malcolm wrote:
In Dzogchen teachings, when the potential of consciousness manifests as its own display, if that display is not recognized as its own state, this is called "the connate ignorance." It is called connate (lhan gcig skyes) because it arises in the presence of a similitude of subject and object perception, i.e. it is the the ignorance that arises with the display. Even Samantabhadra experiences this ignorance.

When the perceived display is reified as other, self-grasping ensues immediately. This reification following nonrecognition is called "the imputing ignorance." Following this the twelve limbs of dependent origination begin and there is a bifurcation between samsara and nirvana, often described as "samsara and nirvana turning their backs on one another."

There is a third ignorance, which exists prior to these two, called "the ignorance identical with the cause." This simply means that prior to the potential of consciousness arising as a display, consciousness is unaware of itself.

However, the relative manifestation of teachings on, say, the different realms, or teachings on the nature of nirvana, etc could be conceived of as distinct from that of DO, which has it's own relative manifestation.

Ultimately, as I said in the quote from the Avatamsaka Sutra, I think enlightened knowledge is unfragmented. But its relative manifestations are myriad. All of those relative manifestations fit under the 4 NT, conceptually.

Seeker12 said:
Is that not included in the 4NT?

In the Khenjuk, and I think likewise in the Abhidharmasamuccaya, within the 4th NT of the "Path" it says basically that "as a remedy for delusion, 'contemplation of interdependence' establishes the fact that all outer and inner phenomena originate in dependent connection, and thus arise free from eternalism or nihilism..." This quote is from the Khenjuk, and the AS says, basically the same: "For those whose character is dominated by delusion (bhuyomohacarita) the object is meditation on conditioned origination (pratityasamutpada) which concerns conditioned nature (idam pratyayata)..."

It seems to me that dependent origination is sort of a subset of the 4NT, in other words, and is included in the 4th NT (and perhaps in the 2nd as well in an explanatory role). Generally all knowledge of samsara would be included in the 1st, all knowledge of the cause of samsara would be included in the 2nd, all knowledge of the end of samara would be included in the 3rd, and all knowledge of the means to that end - including understanding DO - would be included in the 4th. This can absolutely be understood from a Mahayana point of view.

Malcolm wrote:
You are missing the point: all religions recognize that suffering exists, that is has a cause, and it can cease. They merely disagree about the means. In that case then, what is unique about Buddha's teachings? Certainly not the first three truths. Moreover, every religion has their idea of right view, etc. So the eightfold path, arguably, is not so unique either. So we are left with the question: what doctrine is absolutely unique to Buddhadharma? That, I would argue, and have for many years, is dependent origination and its corollary, emptiness free from extremes. Moreover, the Buddha did not invent this idea. This has been the consistent teaching of all the Buddhas of past, is the teaching of the Buddha of the presence, and will be the teaching of all Buddhas of the future.

This diagnostic idea is common to all religions: there is a problem, the problem has a cause, the problem can be resolved because there is a method to solve that problem. There is no need to enshrine common sense as a religious dogma.

There are more important principles deserving of consideration in Buddhadharma, notably, dependent origination. As the Buddha said, "Whoever sees dependent origination sees the Dharma. Whoever sees the Dharma sees me." When Nāgārjuna set out to correct Hinayāna deviations from the Buddha's true message, he did not focus on the 4NT, his refrain again and again was that one needed to understand what "arising from conditions" really meant and how understanding the Buddha's actual message undermined all substantialist misunderstandings of what the Buddha taught. Elevating the 4NT bears the error of promoting a prescriptive understanding of Buddhadharma when there are more important principles to understand.

Though 16 moments with respect to the four truths are mentioned in the Abhisamayālaṃkara, they are completely different and have to do with recognizing, for example, that there is no truth in the truth of suffering at all, i.e. the truth of the suffering is the fact that suffering is not established, that suffering has the nature of the dharmadhātu, and so on. Moreover, the Abhisamayālaṃkara that for Mahāyanis the truth of the path is the six perfections and not the 8FP. The one thing that Hinayāna and common Mahāyāna do share however is that they are both paths of renunciation.

If you read carefully, you will understand that the Buddha (Gautama) states very clearly that when he was under the bodhitree, he rediscovered the principle of dependent origination through recalling all of his past lives, which necessarily means he recalled teachings he had received from previous buddhas.

Wayfarer said:
I have never encountered that interpretation before. Does it say this explicitly that the Buddha learned the truth of dependent origination, in previous lives, from other Buddhas? The brief description of his recollection of earlier lives that I am familiar with is this one:
When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, & attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past lives. I recollected my manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two... five, ten... fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand, many eons of cosmic contraction, many eons of cosmic expansion, many eons of cosmic contraction & expansion: 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure & pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure & pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes & details.
— MN 36

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, "Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes & details..." How can one imagine he did not recall teachings he had received from the many buddhas he attended in the past? It is not thinkable.





Wayfarer said:
The canonical declaration of the Buddha as 'self-enlightened' is this:
I have heard that on one occasion, when the Blessed One was newly Self-awakened, he was staying at Uruvela on the bank of the Nerañjara River, at the foot of the Goatherd's Banyan Tree. Then, while he was alone and in seclusion, this line of thinking arose in his awareness: "One suffers if dwelling without reverence or deference. Now on what brahman or contemplative can I dwell in dependence, honoring and respecting him?"

Then the thought occurred to him: "It would be for the sake of perfecting an unperfected aggregate of virtue that I would dwell in dependence on another brahman or contemplative, honoring and respecting him. However, in this world with its devas, Maras, & Brahmas, in this generation with its brahmans and contemplatives, its royalty and common-folk, I do not see another brahman or contemplative more consummate in virtue than I, on whom I could dwell in dependence, honoring and respecting him.

"self-awakened" is a translation gloss. It is not accurate. It is a result of interpretive license.

So even if we use your view of past buddhas for determining the original Dharma (and not just Gautama's Dispensation), there is still this which you have quoted yourself and goes to show that buddhas review their myriad past lives, recall dependent origination and attain buddhahood. Using your own words, there is still an original Dharma there that is taught by all buddhas. This is the Dharma Gautama rediscovered and taught, the Path.
Avoid all evil, Cultivate the good, Purify your mind; this is the teaching of the Buddhas.
Dhammapada 183
This is an original Dharma too, taught by all buddhas.
" So too, monks, I saw the ancient path, the ancient road traveled by the Perfectly Enlightened Ones of the past. And what is that ancient path, that ancient road? It is just this Noble Eightfold Path; that is, right view, right intention, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration. I followed that path and by doing so I have directly known aging-and-death, its origin, its cessation, and the way leading to its cessation. I have directly known birth ... existence ... clinging ... craving ... feeling ... contact... the six sense bases ... name-and-form ... consciousness ... volitional formations, their origin, their cessation, and the way leading to their cessation. Having directly known them, I have explained them to the monks, the nuns, the male lay followers, and the female lay followers. This spiritual life, monks, has become successful and prosperous, extended, popular, widespread, well proclaimed among devas and humans. "

The great Garchen Rinpoche, at a series of empowerments in L.A. a couple of years ago, also discussed this issue. He talked about the commitments and the dangers inherent in failing t keep those commitments. He said He had thought a lot about whether it is good to give empowerments to all-comers. At the end, He decided that the potential benefits out-weighed the potential dangers -- meaning Enlightenment in this, the next, within eight, or within a maximum of 16 lifetimes. However, at least one Lama I have studied with said that "guarantee" depended on at least the bare minimum of keeping samaya.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct, if you do not maintain samaya, the max 16 lifetime promise is a no go.

As a corollary of this, somewhere on line I once read something by a Lama who said that, if all people wanted was a no-strings-attached blessing, then that's what they should ask for, not an empowerment. Sorry I don't remember what Lama said that and where it is on line.

Malcolm wrote:
This is a comment made frequently by ChNN. He maintains there is no such thing as an empowerment "given as a blessing." All empowerments, he maintains, come with commitments.

With respect to this, Kunzang Dorje (1130-?), the author of the Vajra Bridge Longed commentary, was relating the fact that his teacher, Dzeng Dharmabodhi (1052-1168) was a direct disciple of Phadampa Sanggye. Dzeng met Phadampa when he was eighteen, and spent a year and a half with him. With respect to the surprising amount of material in Zhi byed, Kunzang Dorje stated it was impossible for Padampa to have actually said that much since he primarily taught with symbols and did not chatter very much with people, or give teachings with many words. With respect to that, Kunzang Dorje states. "All Dharmas are weakened through popularity," meaning the more popular a teaching is and the more widespread it becomes, the weaker its benefit. Such observations should temper our evangelical zeal, especially with respect to Vajrayāna cycles.

1) Do syllables stand for certain words or roots (Sanskrit, Gandhari, Tibetan )? For example, the first "'A" is for anutpada, aprapancha\avikalpa, vaisAradya. The second "A" is for anabhoga, "Sha" is for ksetra for example... I am familiar with Sanskrit at the level of "saw" in the brackets, unfortunately. I would be very happy if someone responds according to the texts or commentaries.

2) How to write them correctly and in what language? Can I make two rows of three letters for an amulet? Something like the image in the picture, but from clay? I want to replace my Phra Somdej. It split at the corners when I was in the hospital and accidentally dropped it )))

Because the mind essence will not be discovered by ordinary people trapped in the thicket of concepts and views without the aid of a guru. For example, if someone does not understand the difference between pyrite and gold, they can be deceived because of a similarity in color if they do not have instruction in how to test them. Likewise, without having a way to test the difference between the mind essence and the mind, one can be easily deceived thinking that one is the other because their "color" is similar. Only a qualified guru can help one distinguish mind from the mind essence, just as only a skilled gemologist can help one distinguish between a fake diamond and a real one.

That is a reason or why your statement would be true, based on theory and tradition, but I don't see how it is a logical proof.

Malcolm wrote:
One cannot see one's own face without a mirror. Likewise, can cannot see the mind essence without a guru.


climb-up said:
You said that the proof that something couldn't happen was that it didn't happen all the time, so I asked why that would prove anything.

Malcolm wrote:
You are suggesting that people can attain realization without a cause. This is rejected in Dzogchen teachings in general. If people could attain realization of their mind essence without a cause, it would just happen randomly. But it does not. That is the point.

Using the example of a crowd, if I tell you to go find John Doe in a large crowd, whom you have never met nor seen a picture of, it is unlikely you find him. Even if you meet a person claiming to be John Doe, you will still have a find someone who knows the John Doe for whom you are searching to confirm you have met the right John Doe. However, once you have met John Doe, and it is confirmed to be the correct John Doe, you will always been able to recognize him on your own. So it is with the mind essence.

climb-up said:
Still, I think that makes my point. Since we all (fully enlightened Buddhas excepted of course) act out of affliction, even those who have discovered the nature of their mind, then we can't look from the outside and consider out judgments of others afflicted actions as being proof of their not having discovered anything.

Malcolm wrote:
It is not the case that all apart from Buddhas act out of affliction. Where did you get this idea? It is not true. Even ordinary persons who have achieved patience on the Mahāyāna path of application no longer act out of affliction.

If the proof that people don't find the nature of mind on their own is that they act out of affliction; firstly, in regards to the above, are you saying that you know the actions of EVERYONE? That would be quite impressive.

Malcolm wrote:
The actions of all sentient beings who are not on a path are afflicted. The actions of sentient beings on the path are also afflicted, though they are likely to be more mindful of afflictions as they arise and thus act with more restraint.

Secondly, that would mean that everyone who has discovered the nature of mind does not act out of affliction. That would be similarly impressive.

People who are in true possession of the knowledge of their own state are less likely to act out of affliction.

Original buddhism refers to this path; 4NT and 8FP.

I doubt you will find that all Buddhas teach 4NT and 8FP.

For example, there is a verse in the Vinaya that is more likely to be the core teaching of all Buddhas:
Abandon non-virtue. 
Cultivate virtue. 
Observe one's mind.
This is the teaching of the Buddhas.
I still would not call this the original Buddhism. Buddhas do not teach according to some plan. Buddhas teach according to the needs of sentient beings. For example, the first buddha of this eon taught Dzogchen, not the 4NT and 8FP. But somehow, I do not think you are likely to accept this. Based on the latter fact, claiming there is some original Buddhism is basically just a faith-based claim, not grounded in facts.

Perhaps Vasubandhu's comments (Thurman's version) will make clear, what does not seem so unclear.  First the root verse 60 of Maitreya, then Vasubandhu.  Verse 61 is skipped:
60. You have achieved the ultimate!
You have transcended all the stages!
You have become the chief of all beings!
You are the liberator of all beings!

The buddha character is explained here under headings: nature, cause,
result, activity...
The ultimate achieved is pure suchness, which is the natural reality body
of the buddhas. The transcending through all the bodhisattva stages is the cause.
The achievement of supremacy over all beings is the result. The liberation of all beings
is the activity.
Whether one puts the emphasis on the paramita practices during the 10 stages, or the notion of 'transcending through' which DZ folk may prefer, it seems clear enough.

The cause of such enlightenment is the emerging definitively and perfectly beyond all of the grounds, and its effect is a forever unfailing supremacy among all sentient beings.

I make it very clear in the introduction to my translation that people really ought to receive the appropriate level of teachings in order to read my translation. This is why I have made an effort to arrange a transmission for the text by a qualified teacher. Even so, this is not enough. One needs to receive proper transmission of a school in order to understand its literature. For example, I rarely opine about Chan/Zen or Theravada (apart from reciting Sarvastivada doxology, or discussing the various opinions of Tibetan scholars on Chan). Why? Because I have no transmission in those schools at all.

As mentioned before, there were several Nāgārjunas. The first was the founder of the Madhyamaka school. He did not assert that emptiness was a substratum.

Without hearing the Dharma, there is no possibility of reflection; without reflecting on the Dharma, there is no possibility it can be meditated upon.

With respect to the latter, the term "basis" refers to something one has not realized. It does not refer to an entity as such. The thog ma gzhi, the original basis, the mind-essence, is the basis of the recognition or nonrecognition of the nature of one's consciousness. If one reifies this as a substratum, one winds up in Advaita land.

A: I understand the Primordial Buddha, also known as Buddha Samantabhadra, to be the ultimate reality, the realm of the Dharmakaya-- the space of emptiness--where all phenomena, pure and impure, are dissolved. This is the explanation taught by the Sutras and Tantras. However, in the context of your question, the tantric tradition is the only one which explains the Dharmakaya in terms of Inherent clear light, the essential nature of the mind; this would seem imply that all phenomena, samsara and nirvana, arise from this clear and luminous source. Even the New School of Translation came to the conclusion that the "state of rest" of a practitioner of the Great Yoga--Great Yoga implies here the state of the practitioner who has reached a stage in meditation where the most subtle experience of clear light has been realized--that for as long as the practitioner remains in this ultimate sphere he or she remains totally free of any sort of veil obscuring the mind, and is immersed in a state of great bliss.

We can say, therefore, that this ultimate source, clear light, is close to the notion of a Creator, since all phenomena, whether they belong to samsara or nirvana, originate therein. But we must be careful in speaking of this source, we must not be led into error. I do not mean chat there exists somewhere, there, a sort of collective clear light, analogous to the non-Buddhist concept of Brahma as a substratum. We must not be inclined to deify this luminous space. We must understand that when we speak of ultimate or inherent clear light, we are speaking on an individual level.

monktastic said:
http://hhdl.dharmakara.net/hhdlquotes22.html

I do not understand this. All phenomena in "my" world -- including the colorful splotches I describe as "other beings" -- originate from "my" Samantabhadra. What sense does it make to speak of "other" worlds (or beings with their own Samantabhadras), if, by definition, I can never encounter them in any way?

If everything I could ever call "world" came from "my" Samantabhadra, then I still have no way of distinguishing this concept from "god."

Edit: Except, of course, that I should look for it "inside" and not "outside."

Malcolm wrote:
It is commonly misunderstood that when one says "all the dharmas of samsara and nirvana" this refers to entities out there in the world. It does not. It refers to one's own aggregates, sense bases, and elements. "All phenomena" means the one aggregate, the material aggregate with its external objects made of the four elements; one sense base refers to the sense base of the mind; and elements refers to the dharmadhātu which contains all the mental factors and unconditioned phenomena.

Thus, when one does not recognize the basis for what it is, one reifies the five lights of one's own pristine consciousness as the five elements; at the same time oneself is doing this, so are infinite myriads of other sentient beings. Shabkar for example, uses the example of how a women who meditated on herself as a tigress terrified a small village in order to show that our own mental projections can generate appearances for others and vice versa:
When a devaputra asked the Buddha:
"Who made Meru, the sun and the moon, and so on?"
The Buddha said:
"There is no other creator here.
The attachment of the traces of one’s conceptuality
imputes them, grasps them and then they appear in that way.
Everything is created by one’s mind."
When the devaputra asked the Buddha again:
"How can the attachment of my concepts
make the hardness and stability of
Meru, the sun and moon, and so on?"
The Buddha said:
"In Varanasi, an old woman
meditated her own body as a tiger.
Since the villagers saw her
as a tiger, they evacuated the village.
If one is able to appear like that for a little while,
if one cultivates mental traces for beginningless lifetimes,
one will be able to appear like this for a year."
Therefore, everything is created by the mind.

The Rig pa rang shar states:
If someone does not dwell in words and does not dwell in names,
that is Prajñāpāramitā,
the transcendent state of buddhahood itself.
And:
Migrating beings are led with the noose of the method
through concrete objects to wisdom. 
Therefore it is the Prajñāpāramita. 
The vast dhātu of Samantabhadra
arises in the dharmatā of unceasing play. 
The dhātu of wisdom, the transcendent state, 
lacks attachment, the nature of grasping. 
Since it is nonconceptual, it is beyond speech and thought.
For example, like a magic display in the sky,
it is said to be free from the Dharma of expression.
Thus we can see that Prajñāpāramita and Great Perfection have equivalent meanings.

The Union of the Sun and Moon Tantra, source of Song of the Vajra, states:
Someone who has not settled into concentration
will settle naturally with this. 
When the yogin is lethargic,
when revitalized by this, samadhi is good;
it seals one’s mind with bliss,
joined with the state of mahāmudra;
one can enter into all of the guru’s intimate instructions;
emptiness is also supported on the continuum;
Perceptions are liberated in their own place;
mental entities are purified. 
Therefore, sing the song of the vajra
and always do the vajra dance.
Therefore, one can understand that Mahāmudra is nothing other than the state of Dzogchen.

Before we get to the experience of abiding etc. we have to have that belief, I assert, or we wouldn't attend. Having done so, if the experience is transformative, we gain a belief that it is effective and may conclude therefore that further steps on the path are worthwhile.

I don't think anyone is challenging the position that belief without experience is pretty useless, but even if we base our path on the experiences of ChNN and engage in Dzogchen in order to have our own experiences, it is not wholly useless, surely.

Malcolm wrote:
Belief is useless. For example, I am ill. Whether I believe a medicine will help me or not is irrelevant. If the correct medicine is given for the illness it will be cured. It does not matter whether I believe it or not.

For example, if you do some practice believing in some effect it is supposed to have, and you do not have that experience, you may lose confidence.

If you approach practices without any belief in them one way or another, then you are more likely to discover the point of that practice.

Belief is thinking something is true without knowing whether it is true. This is not the standard we apply in Dzogchen teachings. We apply a higher standard. You do not believe what you know. The main term in Dzogchen is " rig pa," "to know."

He could just as easily have said discussion is useless.

The context of the remark was one in which ChNN was contrasting "belief" against "direct experience." Hence his statement, "You can believe in anything." Beliefs are just concepts. They shift and change. One day you believe doing this practice is the best, the next day, you believe another is better. One day you believe America is a great place, the next day, you believe it sucks.

What Tibetan word is being translated as "faith" in the passage below? From Rongzom's Entering the Way of the Great Vehicle:

Rongzom said:
When this Great Perfection approach to the path is taught in a condensed manner, it is said that the bases of all phenomena are included simply within mind and mental appearance; the nature of the mind (citta) itself is awakening (bodhi) and thus referred to as the mind of awakening (bodhicitta). There is nothing to be taught other than this. People with faith in the Great Perfection approach realize and penetrate it through being shown this alone.

tomamundsen said:
Is the phrase "belief is useless" compatible with the above?


Malcolm wrote:
The word Rongzom uses is "faith," dad pa or śraddhā. But we have to point out what śraddhā actually means. According to Vasubandhu, faith is the mental factor that brings clarity to the mind. So, "faith" is not belief, per se. In fact, it is one of the five faculties, which are part of the thirty-seven adjuncts to awakening.

When we look at what the word means in Tibetan, the first definition is confidence ( yid ches pa ) (the second definition is joy ( dga' ba ) or attachment( chags pa )). Thus, the passage would be more accurately translated, "People with confidence in the Great Perfection approach realize and penetrate it through being shown this alone." Norbu Rinpoche tends to translate this term as "interest," thus the passage could also be rendered, "People interested in the Great Perfection approach realize and penetrate it through being shown this alone."

Dominic (a nice guy, very smart) also translated "tshul" as "approach," where as I would prefer here to say "principle", thus "People interested/confident in the principles of the Great Perfection realize and penetrate it through being shown this alone."

So yes, the phrase "belief is useless" is absolutely compatible with the above.

Well, the belief that belief is useless may be useful in some circumstances. Perhaps if there is an assumption that belief is like 'blind faith' and a conclusion rather than a motivation.

Are we all are clear about when belief ends and faith begins, I wonder?  I'm not.

We may posit that enlightenment is possible, and use that belief as motivation for our path, without any experience of enlightenment itself, nor any evidence that what others have experienced, including our Gurus, is actually taking them there.

So without belief, where is motivation, path and fruit?

First DI?  No, first a motivation, so a belief that DI is something worth having before we have any experience of it.

I'd say the process is iterative - we have enough belief to embark on the path, to experience, to reinforce.  But there is no conclusive belief unless we cease to gain new experiences; hence we my need many lives to attain the enlightenment we believe to be possible, and in doing so may regard our earlier beliefs as incomplete or even totally wrong.

Could it be that belief alone is useless?

It seems to me that belief cannot truly be useless. We have to believe that it is worthwhile to continue our sadhana for example.
Even if we have experienced contemplation, if we are not fully enlightened Buddhas we have to believe that continuing on without doubt will, at the very least, improve our condition. 
Also, even if it isn't 100% necessary, I would imagine that for those who have an unwavering belief in the stories of Buddha, Guru Rinpoche, et al. and in the claims of the tantras, this would be a very useful belief for continuing on in times of doubt.

Right?

For the life of me, I don't understand how this question trips people up the way it does.

Can you watch a movie and understand it's being performed by actors, and that the narrative is not real? If so, this concept is not so difficult, certainly there is an ex[experience of a conventional self.

Lazy_eye said:
Ok, so let me make sure I get this. The answer is that it is a self-concept, but it's the conventional self. And the Two Truths doctrine explains why there is a conventional self. Correct?

As to how the question trips people up the way it does, I obviously can't speak for everyone who has stumbled over it. But it's well known (I think) that Buddhists across the traditions have grappled with some ambiguities and apparent contradictions between different things said in different scriptures, going all the way back to the early texts.

For example, in http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.046.than.html, the Buddha explicitly rejects the view that "the one who acts is the one who experiences."

On the other hand, according to http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an05/an05.057.than.html, "I am the owner of my actions, heir to my actions, born of my actions, related through my actions, and have my actions as my arbitrator." The statements in these two suttas don't quite align with each other.

It's not always clear how to resolve the seeming contradiction. I understand that a great deal of later Abhidharma and Mayahana doctrinal elaboration, including the Two Truths as well as alaya-vijnana, grew precisely out of the effort to explain this.

Of course I can watch a movie, but I have a functioning memory that allows me to follow the narrative and believe that the same experiencer is sitting in the movie theater from beginning to end. Transmigration across lifetimes is more like watching a movie and having your memory erased halfway through, so you don't remember anything that came before or who you were when you entered the theater.

Anonymous X said:
Staying with the Two Truths doctrine, you only get part of the Totality. Now, for the Three Truths:

From Zongmi on Chan: “The nature axiom has three truths: nature (voidness); characteristics (origination by dependence); and self substance (true mind). The self substance is neither voidness nor form, etc.; it is the potentiality to be both. This corresponds to a mirror’s specific images, the voidness of those images, and the brightness or reflectivity of the mirror itself.
The difference between them concerning the two truths and the three truths. All scholars know that the voidness axiom says that all dharmas, both mundane and supramundane, do not go beyond the two truths. There is no need for quotations to elucidate this. The nature axiom, however, gathers up nature, characteristics, and the self substance [xing xiang ji ziti], and considers them together as the three truths. It takes all dharmas that originate by dependence, such as forms, etc., as the worldly truth and takes [the truth that] conditions lack a self nature and [hence] all dharmas are void as the real truth. (This much is no different in terms of principle from the two truths of the voidness axiom and the characteristics axiom.) That the one true mind substance is neither voidness nor form [but] has the potentiality to be void and the potentiality to be form is the truth of the highest meaning of the middle path.”

For me, without the inclusion of the Tathagatagarbha doctrine, Mahayana and Madhyamaka teachings don't point directly to the heart of the matter.

Since buddhas have no confused perception, and are inseparable from the dharmakaya then the benefit for beings to be guided is ensured through the rupakayas/compassion  and the ability of ordinary beings to perceive these emanations.


If this is so then buddhas see rupakayas as clearly apparent but not truly existing arising in response to other beings. And since there is no confused perception from the perspective of buddhabood, a Buddha perceives what arises for others and can be of benefit through omniscience.

But sentient beings only perceive these emanations depends on the purity of the karma of that individual?

Since this is a recurring area of confusion, perhaps you would be willing to take a moment and explain the difference between a "self" and an "individual mindstream"?  What is the the answer to the charge that "individual mindstream" is just a semantic ploy intended to allow a self-concept back into the Dharma?

One could argue also that the distinction being made is between two different kinds of self-concept -- a static one (maybe a pre-Buddhist "atman"), and a dynamic one that allows for change and impermanence. But as long as it's an "individual" mindstream, there is still this troublesome attribute of "individuality," which sounds like a synonym for selfhood.

Saṃkhya ideas also show up explicitly in other Indian Buddhist Tantras, such as the Samputa. It is very likely they penetrated Budddhist texts via Ayurveda.

Perhaps the earliest text treatment of Samkhya we have is presented in the Carakra Saṃhita, when Caraka provides proofs for rebirth by positing an atman, and then outlining the Saṃkhya system.

The other main place where Buddhism and Samkhya are mismatched, is that in Buddhism in general, the five elements are regarded as primary, from which everything springs, whereas in the Samkhya system the five elements are the grossest aspect of tamas and are the last things to evolve.

And this is something that is readily acknowledged in EBT studies, in my experience, but only selectively so.

Proponents of EBTs and related scholastic ventures are very ready to point out that "schisms" in "Early Buddhism" do not follow the common mould the West expects from its Christian heritage: schisms over points of doctrine and doctrinal interpretation.

For context: almost all schisms in early Christian history are doctrinal schisms over the correct way to conceptualize the divine and human aspects of Jesus Christ. It began first with dehumanizing tendencies (Docetism,
 Eutychianism) which rejected Jesus Christ's humanity, and later heresies were produced from the opposite extreme:
 doubting the divinity of Jesus Christ and framing him as an "ascended master" or just a regular monotheistic prophet (Arianism, Psilanthropism, etc). These are all "conceptual" schisms, or schisms over Christology/Theology.

Instead we have schisms over Vinaya-adaption, monastic practice, and preservation of vinaya observance. It seems that having an "orthodoxy" ("one true teaching") was simply less of a concern. Serious wrong views, we can rest assure, would have been dealt with, but schisms in "Early Buddhism" do not occur over points of doctrine or even points of interpretation of doctrine until a much later period.

Why then do we assume that there was indeed "one true teaching" that served as the ur-teaching for all Buddhisms, and why do we assume the Buddhisms produced by the alleged ur-teaching are necessarily inferior?

It seem the notion of an early Buddhism that does not "schism" over points of doctrine and an early Buddhism that has "one true teaching" are not readily compatible with one-another, unless one wants to argue that Buddhism stayed unschismed with "one teaching" for an extremely unlikely long time (which would contradict much historical evidence for sectarianism).

At a recent translators conference, Jan Nattier gave an excellent talk about the fact that everything we have, Pali canon included, is a translation and that this process of translation began during the Buddha's time. There are no original texts, everything we have is a translation from another language.

Coëmgenu said:
Indeed, all earliest extant Buddhist literature, Buddhavacana included, comes from transmissions of Buddhavacana preserved along sectarian lines with particular interpretations and orthodoxies in mind.

That being said, there is also a smaller body of literature (sūtrāṇi & āgamāḥ) from within the "sectarian literature" (as Buddhist history in EBT studies, it seems, for better for worse, is marked by the notion of a older theoretical "Great Unified Teaching" stage of Buddhadharma-history, which becomes hidden under sectarian misinterpretations over time) which does display a certain amount of convergence that is not as apparent certain other bodies of literature (such as different schools' Abhidharmāḥ).

I was discussing a similar matter to this, that is: how exactly we go about treating this body of apparent "EBTs", on SuttaCentral a while ago, and I hope I am not violating any forum policy of DharmaWheels by quoting something from over there that deals with some of the complicated "fuzzy edges" reconstructed EBT-based Dharma-orthodoxies may well have, contrary to public narratives about EBTs and "Early Buddhism": The EA actually preserves some āgamāḥ which clearly expound Mahāyāna teachings, from EA 27.5:
聞如是： 一時，佛在舍衛國祇樹給孤獨 園。
Heard thus truly: one time, Buddha dwelt [at] Śrāvastī [in] Jetavana.

爾時，彌勒菩薩至如來所，頭面禮足，在 一面坐。
At that-time, Maitreya Bodhisattva came [to the] Tathāgata's location, head facing [downward] bowing [from the] foot [i.e. prostrating or hiding his feet], [then] beside [the Buddha] [to] one side sat.

爾時，彌勒菩薩白世尊言：
At that-time, Maitreya Bodhisattva addressed [the] Bhagavān saying:

「菩薩摩訶薩成就幾法，而行檀波羅蜜，
"[Do] Bodhisattvāḥ Mahāsattvāḥ accomplish myriad dharmāḥ, and perform dānapāramitā,

具足六 波羅蜜，疾成無上正真之道？」
possess [the] path [of] six pāramitāḥ, swiftly accomplish nothing higher correctly [and] truly[,] [the] path?

[The passage in question then goes on to explore the other five pāramitāḥ and have the Buddha agree with Maitreya Bodhisattva's questioning of if the Buddha approves of practice of the six pāramitāḥ (dāna, śīla, kṣānti, vīrya, dhyāna, & prajñāpāramitā) as a path to awakening.]
If we take āgamāḥ like this at face value, it implies that Mahāyāna and Bodhisattvayāna are far older than believed to be. However, there is essentially unanimous consensus among those informed concerning Buddhist textual criticism that āgamāḥ like the one I just quoted above (although there are other more problematic and less clear-cut cases, such as the āgama-parallel of the Paccayasutta ) are Mahāyāna accruals, not original literature from the same layer as the rest of the āgama-material.

Because of this, there is a small deal of controversy within the EBT subcommunity of Buddhist textual criticism, as to if the āgamāḥ and nikāyā together constitute a coherent body of literature or if they are ultimately incoherent (i.e. sectarian) and cannot be used to reliably reconstruct a common Ur-tradition of "Early Buddhism".

A proponent of the alleged (partial, I am phrasing this far stronger than he would ever) incoherence between the āgamāḥ and the nikāyā is Ven Thích Minh Châu, his text The Chinese Madhyama Āgama and the Pāli Majjhima Nikāya is a good text for exploring this presented perspective.

This perspective is disagreed with by proponent of what we could call "EBT coherency", namely our own Ven Sujato and Ven Brahmali, whose text I will now quote, namely, The Authenticity of Early Buddhist Texts, from page 84:
4.3.5 Claiims of incoherence

Scholarship has not succeeded in finding consequential contradictions within the EBTs.

An important challenge to our contention that the EBTs are coherent comes from those who have argued that Buddhism contains fundamental teachings that are hard to reconcile. Probably the most important of these arguments is the claim that Buddhism, specifically the Buddhism of the Pali sources, gives contradictory accounts of the goal of the Buddhist practice, including contradictory accounts of the path of meditation that leads to these goals.

This is not the place to assess these claims in detail, but a few general remarks seem called for. A major problem with these claims, here exemplified by those of Griffiths, is that they often do not distinguish between EBT and non-EBT material. Griffiths says, “The canonical and commentarial literature will be treated here as a unity … because the thrust of this paper is structural and philosophical rather than historical, and for such purposes differentiation between canon and commentary is of small importance.”

This is assuming a point that needs to be proved. In the absence of such proof, it is not possible to ascertain the coherence of the EBTs, or the lack thereof, by relying on non-EBTs. The EBTs need to be considered on their own merits.

Another problem with Griffith’s proposition is his reliance on a very limited number of texts from the EBTs. His main reference is to the Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta. However, in establishing any point about the EBTs one needs to consider the literature as a whole. It is our contention that the problems identified by Griffiths and others fall away once this is done.
This addresses an academic named Griffiths, whose work I cannot access, and does not specifically address Ven Thích Minh Châu's work.

Another proponent EBT coherency, Ven Ānalayo, has however specifically addressed Ven Thích Minh Châu's work from a perspective informed by EBT coherency. His paper, in response to Ven Thích Minh Châu, is available freely online if one googles "The Chinese Madhyama-ågama and the Påli Majjhima-Nikåya – In the Footsteps of Thich Minh Chau Ānalayo".

Like I said earlier though, this essay is addressed to a prodominantly non-Mahāyāna audience, so there will be some redundancies that wouldn't need mentioning to someone interested in and informed about what is reconstructable about the history of early Mahāyāna. I thought it might just interesting to have it here though anyways and as well, because I find that EBT-studies is so often used to point out anything not found in the Pāli Canon as "not an EBT", and any time that EBTs disagree, the Pāli or what "agrees most" with the Pāli is almost always given precedence (as evidenced by the SF hypothesis being used to edit Sarvāstivāda texts to conform with an "EBT orthodoxy"). This essay is mostly to challenge that tendency and to expose one particular misconception: that the dharmakāya is a Mahāyāna "innovation".

Female circumcision in the USA

Clitoridectomy and other circumcision-like operation on girls and women had a longer career in United States, where doctors deplored Baker Brown’s disgrace and The Medical Record defended him with the question "What now will be the chance for recovery for the poor epileptic female with a clitoris?" [11] There was also a vigorous attempt to apply the theories of Lewis Sayre – that many nervous diseases were caused by a tight or non-retractable foreskin – to women, and a number of doctors urged that girls also should have their clitoral hoods excised if there was any suspicion of adhesions of the accumulation of "secretions". In 1892 another defender of Brown (he was "almost on the right track"), Dr Robert Morris, went so far as to suggest that, since 80 per cent of American women suffered from preputial adhesions, all schoolgirls should be inspected to ensure that proper separation between prepuce and clitoris had occurred. He was apparently confident that most of the girls would require surgery, and added: "The separation of adhesive prepuces in young unmarried women should be done by female physicians anyway, and such physicians can be abundantly occupied with this sort of work". [12] It was a valiant effort to expand the market for medical services, and he must have been disappointed that his suggestions were not more widely taken up.

Unknown said:
The history of FGM is not well known but the practice dated back at least 2000 years. It is not known when or where the tradition of Female Genital Mutilation originated from. It was believed that it was practised in ancient Egypt as a sign of distinction amongst the aristocracy. Some believe it started during the slave trade when black slave women entered ancient Arab societies. Some believe FGM began with the arrival of Islam in some parts of sub-Saharan Africa. Some believe the practice developed independently among certain ethnic groups in sub-Saharan Africa as part of puberty rites. Overall, in the history, it was believed that FGM would ensure women’s virginity and reduction in the female desire.

Many commentators believe that the practice evolved from earliest times in primitive communities that wished to establish control over the sexual behaviour of women. The Romans performed a technique involving slipping of rings through the labia majora of female slaves to prevent them from becoming pregnant and the Scoptsi sect in Russia performed FGM to ensure virginity.

The practice is supported by traditional beliefs, values and attitudes. In some communities it is valued as a rite of passage to womanhood. (for example in Kenya and Sierra Leone) Others value it as a means of preserving a girl’s virginity until marriage, (for example in Sudan, Egypt, and Somalia) In most of these countries FGM is a pre-requisite to marriage and marriage is vital to a woman’s social and economic survival. It is believed by some African women that if their daughters are not circumcised would not get husband. This (FGM) harmful tradition has been guided by taboos from generation by generation.

FGM is rooted in culture and some believe it is done for religious reasons, but it has not been confined to a particular culture or religion. FGM has neither been mentioned in the Quran nor Sunnah.

It has been highlighted that FGM was practised in the United Kingdom and United States by the Gynaecologists to cure women of so-called “female weakness” The practice of FGM continues within some communities in various form and even in the 20th century girls and women are still subjected to this harmful tradition.

4. It is perfectly possible—and increasingly necessary—to speak about the ideological roots of Islamism and jihadism, and even about the unique need for reform within mainstream Islam itself, without lapsing into bigotry or disregarding the suffering of refugees. Indeed, when one understands the problem for what it is, one realizes that secular Muslims, liberal Muslims, and former Muslims are among the most desirable allies to have in the West—and, indeed, such people are the primary victims of Islamist intolerance and jihadist terror in Muslim-majority countries.
Muslims became radicalized when Western powers started attacking Muslims. Muslims did not start attacking the West.

He continues to talk about "reform within mainstream Islam itself," while having zero expertise in Islam, being completely ignorant of its history, tradition, language, and doctrines.

He then says:
6. The next acts of jihadist terrorism to take place on American soil will most likely be met with terrifyingly blunt (and even illegal) countermeasures by the Trump administration. If all that liberals can do in response is continue to lie about the causes of terrorism and lock arms with Islamists, we have some very rough times ahead.

Oh, for the Namdrol of old.

I suspect it is extremely aggravating for people (such as Sam Harris) to have their words proof-texted. But, well, c'est la vie, once that mud starts flying, things tend to spiral out of control. Hell, before you know it, you're living in some place called Moscow in 1934 and there's no court of appeal and that court officer with the jackboots and revolver is making you nervous.

But I forget myself. One man's bigotry is another man's subtle postmodernist critique. As we all know. Since we are all enlightened post-enlightenment whatever-we-ares-based-upon-our-present-whim. Indeed, one man's bigotry may be another man's championing of the downtrodden and the oppressed, who all, I have no doubt, would unhesitatingly appreciate all of his sentiments without question. And if they did question these sentiments, well, no need to take the noble savages at their word. They are oppressed, therefore delusional, so our words can be safely uttered in order to liberate them, after all. As long as you are preaching to the correct choir. Or talking about the perfectly appropriate topic, "power differential", as opposed to, I dunno, cultures, or books, or ideologies, or belief-systems or ... well whatever topic it is that makes your points valid and the other man's invalid.

Malcolm wrote:
Different day, different point. You will note that I do not spare Christianity nor Judaism from the charge that they are religions essentially founded on the basis of culture wars and ethnic cleansing.

What we are witnessing now is a fundamentally Christian exercise of power over the Muslim world. Terrorism against Western populations is a direct consequence of US wars of aggression the Middle East, and the failure of an anti-Commiunist foreign policy that made crucial policy errors in the 50's, not limited to the CIA's replacement of Mosedeq with the Pahlavi family in Iran.

I fully understand the anxiety of Europeans who are fearful. I also think that the Harris response, i.e., to try and blame Muslim terrorist behavior on books absurd.

The difference between what I am saying and what Harris says is that I am saying is that monotheism itself is the problem, not any of its particular expressions.

I am not apologizing for Islam, I saying that Harris is a bigot who has problems with Muslims based on their belonging to a religion. For example he claims:

"While the other major world religions have been fertile sources of intolerance, it is clear that the doctrine of Islam poses unique problems for the emergence of a global civilization...The only future devout Muslims can envisage—as Muslims—is one in which all infidels have been converted to Islam, politically subjugated, or killed."

This statement is such absolute bullshit coming from a person who lives among Fundie Christians in the US. His laughable defense of the Second Iraq war is equally pathetic.

He summarizes, "It is not at all clear how we should proceed in our dialogue with the Muslim world." Yes, it is not at all clear when one engages in dehumanizing and humiliating others based on what you imagine they believe.

More specifically, the article agrees with Afflek's characterization of Harris's views of regarding Muslims as "racist." I didn't know Muslims were a race. Learn something new everyday.


Malcolm wrote:
Hatred for Muslims is often racist in character, since what people are reacting to is ethnicity, not religion. Muslims are, by and large, not white people. Religion is just used as an excuse. For example,look at the way Catholics were treated in the US. Irish, Germans, and Italians were all represented with characteristics that were at best subhuman in the press of the day. Most of the so called "anarchists" who were tried in US courts were from Catholic countries, Saco and Vanzetti being just one famous example of Catholics being tried and convicted of crimes in which they had no involvement.

However, perhaps "racist" is the wrong word for Harris. I would settle for "bigot."

They are not mutually exclusive.  One can achieve the signs within the numbers or time.  Sometimes signs may not manifest during the specific practice though, do you believe maintaining the practice is a good idea in that case or would it be better to move on and (possibly) gain the signs later, possibly during another practice?

Was it Maitripa that got sick of accumulating without experiencing signs, and so threw his mala into the latrine in frustration and then...?

Malcolm wrote:
Virupa. However, Virupa had many signs, but since he never received the intimate instructions connected with Vajrayogini from his gurus, he did not properly understand the signs he was having, and interpreted them as bad omens and signs of failure. Thus he became despondent, tossed his mala in the toilet, which led to his dream of Nairatmya, and his subsequent meeting with her in human form. She then sorted him out, and he achieved six bhumis in six days as a result of her teachings.

Personal experience indicates to me that signs are better, and that they often come before one has done a complete number or time. For me the worst practice was mandala, and it was the practice in which I had the best signs. Then the rest of my retreat was a breeze.

The Sakya approach to Ngondro has always been much less number oriented anyway — classically it was based on time periods, one month of this, then that, etc.. The number trip is a rather modern thing for Sakyapas. I did follow it, actually, but in retrospect, I would have done things a little differently. In any case, no matter, I finished my retreat. Another thing, the signs I had from mandala I did not recognize at the time as being specific to mandala, etc. But later on, some years later, I read a commentary that specified the signs of each of the ngondro practices and I can report that I had those experiences.

In Nyingma they have many practices related to Guru Rinpoche. For example, in Dudjom Tersar it is common to practice Drollo as the Guru, Kilaya as the Yidam, and Troma as the Dakini, for blessings, siddhis, and activities respectively.

In Konchok Chidu, we have the outer, inner, and secret guru, Pema Obar, Guru Dragpo, and Simhamukha as guru deva and dakini.

But in the end, it is the practice of guru yoga that is most important in all schools.  All a Nyingma practitioner really needs is Shower of Blessings by Mipham, or something similar.

The long Dudjom Tersar Ngondro states that it itself is enough, and that there is no need to do other creation or completion stage practices. Taking this as a basis, then one is given teachings on the three spaces and the text on rushan, and thogal.

But since people's karma is different, there are many practices of the three roots for people of various dispositions and karmas.

But I reply because, although it is quite a few years since I read any significant amount of Guenther's work, I recall that one of the great difficulties was that he threw terminology from the phenomenological/existentialist tradition exemplified by Heidegger into his translations without explanation, almost as if to imply that the terminology had a clear, obvious, and usable meaning, or as if to  imply that it was necessary to have studied that continental philosophical thinking before being able to engage properly with Buddhism. Perhaps, in this case, he did explain it, but I would be surprised.

Malcolm wrote:
Guenther's works cannot be taken seriously as studies of Dzogchen texts. Despite his obvious kindness to the tradition and number of people like Steve Goodman and Jim Valby whom he encouraged to study it, his books are not about Dzogchen. They are about mapping Western philosophy onto an non-Western tradition. I predict Guenther studies will become a thing someday.

The fact that all teachers give preliminary practices/exercises, of one type or another, is rather more telling than the opinions of internet experts.

To me, if anything, it underlines the extreme need for the guru yoga practice (which is normally part of the preliminaries for any serious Vajrayana practice).

Guru yoga isn't a preliminary. It is the main practice, far more important than any deity yoga.

So to my mind part of the issue is the assumption that ngondro is something everyone should be doing in the first place, not just in how it's done. I mean ultimately we listen to our teachers of course...

Malcolm wrote:
There are ngondros and then there are ngondros, for example, in Dzogchen, the Dzogchen preliminaries are indispensable. But prostrations, recitations of refuge verses and bodhicitta verses, etc., these are all dispensable in Dzogchen.

That said, I did a full ngondro, and it didn't hurt me none.

We all experience moments of unfabricated consciousness at all times, but those moments are contaminated by cognitions. This is what is known in Dzogchen parlance as "unripened rigpa."

Unless our experience is confirmed by an experienced teacher, we, on our own, have no way of validating whether what we think we are experiencing is conceptual blather or moments of unfabricated consciousness.

As far as other lineages go, I don't practice them and I cannot comment on people's experience.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but it would stand to reason that the actual experience of instant presence would be apparent to anyone who has had it. The problem might arise if that person described it in a way to someone else who used a different word or phrase to describe the same thing. Add a third person using yet another word or phrase and it becomes confusing to a listener who has not had it and it could be perplexing to someone who has had it, too.

You make good points about the words. I would think that among the Tibetans, they would arrive at a word or phrase that most teachers could agree describes a term like rigpa.

Malcolm wrote:
Actually, these definitions are quite clearly made in Tibetan texts.

All that remains is for Westerners to stop conditioning Tibetan Lamas with mistranslations from their own naive misunderstandings of Dzogchen texts so that we can have good reliable translations of them based on native definitions of words. For example, with respect to the term dhātu, the actual Tibetan explanation is that a dhātu (dbyings) is a ' byung gnas," a source, hearkening back to the original Sanskrit meaning of dhātu as a "mine."

We must keep in mind that some of the most influential Dzogchen translations where made at a time when not only did the translators not understand Tibetan very well, let alone Dzogchen, but that the Tibetan Lamas involved knew almost no English.

This is not to fault anyone, but merely to point out that Dzogchen translation is still in its infancy. But when one talks about translations, people get all mad because they invest a lot in what they thought they understood through translations they like.

What is ChNN's choice of translation now?

Malcolm wrote:
He gives two glosses, depending on context. One is "instant presence." This is more in reference to the state discovered in direct introduction.

The second is "knowledge of your primordial state [ ye thog gzhi ]." This is more global use of the term, when the term rigpa is used for the actual essence of Dzogchen.

His translators just generally phoneticize the term as rigpa these days, or use instant presence with rigpa in brackets. And his translators also understand that rang rig is not "self-knowing," but rather "one's knowledge."

Malcolm, which Longchenpa translations float your boat?

Malcolm wrote:
They are all transitional, first attempts to translate a difficult subject by a difficult writer into English. Longchenpa' prose style is considered very elegant in Tibetan, but in English it has been generally rendered very turgidly so far. His verse translates into English somewhat more elegantly, but without considerable intellectual contrivance on the part of the translator, his verse, like most Tibetan verse, winds up being rendered very prosaically.

But as with all first attempts, there can be errors, sometimes important ones, like the calque for dharmadhātu, "basic space of phenomena;" or the use of "ineffability" for nonexistence (med pa), which was the result of a translator/editorial team imposing a top down interpretation on a text, rather than reading the text itself, and more importantly, the tradition as a whole. Sometimes inertia just sets in, where people just follow what people before them did out of lack of certainty, clear research, or laziness.

Hi,

First: great forums, really impressed.

I have a question: I've been a practicing Buddhist for decades. Got some personal instruction and also direct introduction to the nature of the mind, and studied. My Teacher passed away, and I recently begun strongly wanting to deepen my practice again but where I live now there are absolutely no centers, no Lamas to talk to face to face. I guess a Tibetan might call the place where I live a barbaric land... sigh, anyway, I have no means of travel so that's that.

Do you maybe know qualified Lamas who would be willing to give instruction by skype or any way that's not face to face, but from afar?

Not ideal, not as good as meeting in person, but also not as bad as not having the karma to get any instruction at all. So I'm looking.

Thanks
