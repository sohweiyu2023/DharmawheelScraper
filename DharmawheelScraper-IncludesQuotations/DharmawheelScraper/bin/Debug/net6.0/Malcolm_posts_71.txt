Renunciation doesn't mean departing from worthwhile friends (kalyāṇa-mitra), though generally speaking mundane affairs and a lot of social engagements take people away from spiritual cultivation and practice. The Buddha himself was keen on the value of likeminded friends, though he cautioned everyone about mundane attachments and strong social ties and duties. This is what I have in mind at the moment.

Human beings are meant to be in communities with one another. This is why the Buddha said that friendship is the whole of the so called "spritual life". The idea that we are somehow better off in isolation is a fundamental error that comes about from not understanding who we are.

HH the Dalai Lama Dharamsala Lam Rim Commentary 1998

Therefore Kagyupas must know the Mahamudra teaching in Sakya. The Sakyapas must know Dzogchen, they must know Kagyu. The Gelugpas must know Dzogchen, they must know Sakya and Kagyu. Such knowledge should not be learned merely for scholarship but for the sake of one's practice.

For the sake of one's practice one should receive important empowerments, get important transmissions and in this way on the one hand you will get some idea and knowledge, and at the same time be able to gain more understanding.

In my own experience, with regards to understanding the meaning of clear light as explained in the Guyyasamaja, I was able to get much inspiration from my study and understanding of Dzogchen. Likewise, certain teachings in the Gelugpa tradition, such as the explanation of the three voidnesses, such kind of understanding will be very helpful in understanding the Dzogchen or Nyingma tradition.

Tonpa Shenrab lived much earlier than Vasubandhu and the Buddha. There are some passages in the mDzod phug that are shared with the Kosha, but not very many, actually. But the Meru Cosmology etc., is basically the same. Therefore, the Bonpos claim the Mdzod phug influenced Buddhist cosmology.

Most modern scholars believe that the Mdzod Phug was partially influenced by the Kosha. However, the Mdzod Phug has a great deal of material in it that indicates it was also highly influenced by Dzogchen and so on. The materials in it are rich and have not been studiedvery much.

It is said that environment is stronger than will.  I am deeply involoved with my practice but I am very isolated from my teachers and sangha.  I work as a cook in busy restaurants where drug and alcohol use is rampant.  In one sense this provides me with oppurtunites for postmeditation practices, but I have always fallen prey to the influence of those around me.  I do pretty good, but man it certaintly is not easy!  I feel like I am living a double life, most people don't know that I am a practicioner, even though its been a huge part of my life for nearly ten years.  I would really like to say that I will never relapse again, but like I said, its not easy, espicially when drugs are literally in my face.  This is where a lot of the doubt comes from, becaue I have failed so many times in the past.  Drugs really screwed me up, I still feel their effects years later and I am sure that I have yet to pay the full price of my mistakes.

I think figures like Ajahn Brahm are worth considering. He's definitely an adept and highly attained yogi.

However, the lot of us sit on our arses worrying about our financial future and careers, so we're not really willing to give it all up for liberation. Perhaps doubt prevents many of us from doing it.

Thanks for the correction, Malcolm.  In Tibetan Astrology is the full moon considered a time when things (projects, ideas, and so forth) come to a certain culmination? (I know it is in Vedic and Western)  If so, as a Menpa would you think that is a way to mark time (so to speak), in a way, of when doshas are effected on a more minute level than on a seasonal level (even though of course it is a gradual process, happening moment to moment)?   I would just like your thoughts on this, please.

A calander year contains either three or four seasons, depending on how the seasons are split up or reckoned.  Whether it is reckoned as three or four seasons, a calander year still consist of twelve complete lunations or moon cycles.  Sometimes (every 2 - 3 years), there is an additional moon cycle in a calander year, because the length of lunations varies depending on how close the moon is to the earth at any given time at which it cycles, as well as other reasons.

I know that advice is given in Tibetan Medicine for diet and lifestyle by season.  The reason being that certain elements are dominant during certain seasons and this can disturb humours, effect digestion, etc.-- we accumulate certain things more at certain times.  However, I also know that ancient people marked time by lunar phases.  Specifically, the full moon (the end of a lunation) is the time where things come to completion.  So, I was wondering if there is any extant advice for diet, behavior, cleanses etc., taught by lunations, that is to say for each of the individual 12 moon cycles in a calander year (whether over 3 or 4 seasons).

Thanks,

Kevin

How important and widespread is the use of psychedelics such as datura in order to have visions of Vajrayoginis, Dakinis, Taras etc. amongst Vajrayana masters and practitioners? Are these visions to be seen as genuine spiritual experiences or just mere hallucinations of the mind on drugs? I would love to hear your opinions on this matter.


Malcolm wrote:
In general there is no use of hallucinogens in Varjayāna. Even in the case of certain exceptions, these usages are no longer current i.e. they are not part of the living tradition. Where they were used, hallucinogens served only to demonstrate that the mind was not a fixed substance.

People who have used hallucinogens can understand their experiences with this in this respect. Garab Dorje clearly states in one commentary that hallucinogens merely generate worldly visions. So from a Vajrayāna perspective, hallucinogens do not have much, if any, spiritual value.

That being said, this is not to deny the value of the spritual traditions of Huichol Indians, or Ayahuasca shamans who commune with plant spirits, etc.

You need to learn the distinction between gender orientation and sexual activity.

According to the traditional teachings anal or oral sex (ears, etc., are also included here under the general connotation of wrong orifice) is sexual misconduct whether done with a man or a woman.

Masturbation, for lay people, is not included in sexual misconduct.

Important note by SSI about this book:
The Practice and Action Mantras of Dark Garuda is reserved for those who have received the direct transmission of these mantras from Chögyal Namkhai Norbu and were thus physically present at the Dark Garuda retreat at Merigar West on the days when the mantras were transmitted or at a later retreat on this Dark Garuda practice.

To be eligible to do this practice and read the book, you must have been present at Merigar West on the day when the mantras were transmitted during the August 2011 retreat or listening to the webcast from Kunsangar North on July 27, 2012.

Last year's transmission of Khyung Nag could not be given as a donwang -- Rinpoche mentioned this during the Moscow retreat a couple of days ago. However, he was able to give Takhyung as a donwang. In any case, the medicine tantra has a homage to Takhyung in the very introduction, so the Takhyung practice is more closely related with the transmission in the Srog sman tantra he gave last year in Moscow than the Khyung nag practice he gave in Merigar last year.

As others have also pointed out, ChNN is giving direct introduction ridiculously often... I can only think of one webcast in the last year when he didn't give it, and it was announced beforehand that it was a general public teaching and not a transmission. WWT is only as special as all of Rinpoche's other webcasts and vice versa.



Malcolm wrote:
A bit of history is in order:

Originally, we practiced the Guru Yoga of White A on Garab Dorje's anniversary at the same time, around the world, on the hour of Garab Dorje's birth. We also did the same Padmasambhava guru yoga of medium thun for Padmasambhava and Adzom Drugpa's anniversary. We did this because if the importance of these three holidays for practitioners in the DC.

Then, in the late 90's, Rinpoche instituted the WWT with videos, using a video to synchronize practitioners so he could give DI, stating that introduction is beyond the limits of distance -- i.e. just as long as practitioners where present following the tape, and he was following the tape, direction introduction was occuring. The reason was that he was trying to make it possible for interested newcomers to receive transmission even if they could not immediately attend a retreat.

With the advent of the webcasts, he was able to switch live broadcasts of the WWT on these three important anniversay days.

Ultimately, the import of WWT is to do Guru Yoga at these special times with the whole community around the world, and not just to receive DI.

I was questioning whether it is healthy to cultivate aversion, considering the emphasis Buddhism places on its being unhealthy. The consensus seems to be that for some cultivating aversion to samsara is more helpful than it is unhealthy, and I will go along with that.

Sometimes, when we understand the context ourselves, we forget how it appears to newcomers.

Malcolm wrote:
The term is sbrum which has two meanings 1) A pregnant woman 2) A lustful woman.

The term refers to the second sense. Since tigeresses are only lustful when they are in heat, and since in many sadhanas the tigress is termed gzhon nu i.e. young, hence the oral communication indicates that the tigress in question is experiencing her first heat and is in a fit of crazed lust. If you have ever seen a cat go through her first heat, then you will understand better.

Jikan said:
I agree that ideology (defined in the sense of false consciousness) and identification are certainly problematic in either case, but I don't think both Islam and Fascism (or rather being-a-Muslim and being-a-Fascist) are reducible to ideology.  It's possible to be born Muslim, for instance, and hence to have an Islamic identity projected onto you; the current American president inherited some of this with his middle name (and hence the conviction among the wingnut-o-sphere that Barry Obama from Hawaii is clearly a Muslim and ipso-facto a "Terrist").  It's not possible to become a Fascist without having made a choice.  And unlike a traditional religious identity, which is essentially a social marker, you can choose to stop identifying as a Fascist, to stop doing or promoting Fascism, and you're done.  Try no longer being a Muslim or a Jew for that matter; it would mean a change in your life on the magnitude of joining the witness protection program (new name, new family, new hometown, all that).

That's the distinction I'm getting at.  I don't disagree with your premise that we really need to stop identifying and taking this stuff at face value as real (that's the "demystification" of ideology as false consciousness, which basically means coming to grips with your situation broadly speaking, not the make-believe world of us as good and them as bad).  I disagree there's a significant and important human difference between Islam and Fascism that needs to be recognized, or else one risks minimizing one or the other.

Islam's a religion.  Fascism is a political program.  Different functions, different conditions, different consequences, some of which may overlap.

Malcolm wrote:
Are you saying that once born a Muslim, you cannot cease being a Muslim? Are you saying one necessarily chooses to be a republican? Because I certainly know Christians who have become Buddhists, etc. I know many people who are excorciated for changing their political beliefs, and know of some who have even been killed for it.

I think it is glib to propose that political idenities cannot be projected as easily as religious ones -- communist, facist, etc.

I don't think you are making very convincing arguments for privelging religious ideologies over political ones -- they are both equally malleable and susceptible to being cuturally embedded -- for example, Socialism in Tuscany. Try being a Facist in Tuscany!

Just because all ngondro contain the same elements doesn't mean that you can mix and match those elements as you choose.

Malcolm wrote:
You are not addressing a point that anyone has suggested. The OP wanted to know if they could change their ngondro practice, for example, and do a different one instead of the one they started with.

It is the opinion of some people this creates "traces" about not finishing this or that practice. It is the opinion of others that there is no fault at all. If you are interested in some other practice more than the one you are doing, then you can change. For example, if you are doing Sakya ngondro, but the decide you would rather do Longchen Nyinthig, then in my opinion, fine. If you have finished refuge/bodhicitta for example, and want to begin this new ngondro at Vajrasattva, then fine.

Refuge is Refuge. Why? Because if you are doing refuge correctly, not only do you imagine the gurus of the lineage specific that to that lineage, but you are always enjoined to understand the gurus and lineages of all teachings you have are present there as well. This is a universal instruction in every ngondro tradition. Therefore, for example if you are doing refuge in the Dudjom tersar ngondro, but have received Ngondro for something else like Sakya, Kagyu, etc., you are automatically including all those lineages. If you are doing a Nyingma ngondro, and it is dragging along, but become inspired by Karma Kagyu, and then you can approach this practice enthusiastically because you have a good connnection with that teacher, for example, then it is better for you to change your ngondro and not be stuck in conceptual limits.

If you go to a teacher, and you want mahāmudra teachings, and they decide to begin with the 18 hells (as happened to ChNN), then since you asked for their teachings, you respect that teacher and listen to their teaching, even if you know the subject perfectly. Why? Because you asked. You don't decide to reject that teacher's teachings because it is not conforming to your perfect wish.

However, if you have received teachings, respectfully, then you make sure in your own practice that you are focusing the essentials of whatever practice you have received, and you do the practice/s that are really working well for you. You should not be passive and always expect this or that lama to know what is best for you. You should take responsibility for yourself because we are not children that need to be taught step by step how to tie our shoes.

If anything, what western practitioners lack is balance -- on the one hand, some practitioners simply will not follow any guidance at all. On the other hand, some practitioners refuse to think for themselves and become completely passive. Niether of these approaches is good. Practitioners need to consult with their teachers on essential points, and also need to take responsibiliuty for their own practice and decide what is working, and what is not.

If you have the fortune of feeling that your teacher is an awakened person, like I do, then as username mentions, you should not be looking for any advice from anyone else but that person. If you do not have that feeling, then it is better not to invent it, and it is also better to take responsibility for your own practice and try to understand the essentials.

However, the vast majority of Nyingma, Sakya, and Kagyu Ngondros are basically the same with small variations in order, and differ only in the actual words, but do not differ at all in the essence.

And all ngondros all have exactly the same point, as you will readily agree, i.e. Guru Yoga.

Malcolm wrote:
Termas are always connected with Kama -- for example, Shitro is connected with Guhyagarbha, but also with the mandala of peaceful and wrathful deities that are found directly in Dzogchen tantras such as the Rigpa Rangshar.

In this case, the klong gsal teachings are connected with the Nirmanakāya Dakini Gomadeva, the Sambhogakāya ḍākinī Guhyajñāna, etc. In terma there are many cycles of Guhyajñāna teachings. Guhyajñāna is the source of Simhamukha, Mamo Ekajati, etc., as well.

In general, with Gomadevi, there is nothing to refresh, it is unique. I do not know of any practice cycles previously that are connected with her. However, she however is a fully realized Dzogchen master, and you can read about her in The Great Image -- she is the ninth master in the lineage of Sems sde.

Mandarava practice on the other hand is a more recent practice of Mandarava.

Lama Khandro Thugthig has three series, outer, inner and secret. The outer practice concerns Guru Rinpoche and Jñānaḍākinī.

The klong sde cycle of klong gsal is based on the Vajra Bridge instructions of Vairocana, etc. So of course, for all of ChNN's klong gsal series there is a kama basis. If there was no Kama basis, it would not be a valid teaching.

So if someone has an open mind, and is interested, then they can learn the teachings of klong gsal and apply them. Otherwise, if you do not apply them, they are of no benefit at all.

They are not traditional terma teachings revealed in the traditional manner i.e. he received an index, etc., and then went and took them out of the ground, etc.

My remark about new termas comes from my master, the late Kunzang Dechen Lingpa, who considered ChNN to be an incomparable master of Dzogchen (his words, not mine). KDL said that since there is no samaya breakage with new termas, they have stronger blessings. And to practice the termas of a master while he is still alive carries the greatest blessings of all.

The main point is that we have to respect each other. That does not mean we have to agree about everything.

As far as DC topics go, we need to respect that closed webcasts are closed for a reason. People should not be having disagreements about what ChNN says in forums like this. If you have doubt, make an effort to purchase the mp3's.

People in the DC need to respect other people's POV. This does not mean that we have to agree, or admit they are right. We only need to pay attention to our own practice without attempting to condition others.

For example, many people think you need to be a Buddhist in order to be a Dzogchen practitioners. I don't agree, but I respect the opinion of those people who think so. Their approach is not wrong. But neither is mine.

ChNN is an unusual teacher. He is not presenting Dzogchen as part of the Nyingma or Bon traditions. We who are his students do not necessarily consider ourselves Nyingma or Bon. Some may, but most of us do not. This can cause some misunderstanding.

So, non-DC people need to understand that attitude of DC people is not typical of Tibetan Buddhists in other traditions, including Bon. DC people need to respect that Buddhists have a very specific POV around Dzogchen. If this is kept in mind, and we communicate with respect, then this will eliminate most problems.

In many Indo-European religions we find reference to a mountain being at the center of a culture's cosmological vision. For example, Olympus (Greek), Asgard (Norse), Harā Bərəzaitī (Persian) and Mount Meru (Indic).

Clearly the fact these diverse cultures share the same mythological element speaks of a common source.

So what are we to make of it? This is a controversial issue in modern times because it has been discovered that our planet is not made up of four continents with Meru at the center.

However, Mount Meru is said to be the abode of various deities up to a certain point, which would indicate it is not physical, but something beyond our ordinary physical realm.

The Vedic proponent Richard Thompson in his work Vedic Cosmography and Astronomy suggested that Mount Meru is part of a transcendental cosmological map. He demonstrated that the ancient Indians had scientific astronomical knowledge, but given the divine nature of the knowledge it extended beyond the physical realm, hence beyond what we can ordinarily perceive.

Or are we just talking about ancient cosmology that failed to pass the test of modern cosmology and hence can be set aside without further ado?

Incidentally, in the tantras, they use the definition of the cittamatra school since ālayavijñāna is relative consciounsess that is a function of the body.

I resolved these discrepancies. Take another look at my analysis. What you said might be the formulaic subscriptions given by certain teachers from certain lineages at certain times, but there is no reason to think these should remain so fixed.

Malcolm wrote:
I go by the definitions provided in the man ngag sde tantras where the definition of the ālaya is well defined. It is of little use to reconcile different terminologies apart from noting that they refer to different things.

In Mahāmudra and Lamdre, ālaya refers to the nature of the mind i.e. inseperable clarity and emptiness. In Dzogchen ālaya refers to ignorance. It is very simple. Not even worth a discussion, really.

deepbluehum said:
I tend to differ with Jnana's quoted material for the following reasons. The source is myself and my experience with oral transmission in the Vajrayana lineages.

The first Five Consciousnesses (Vijnana) correspond to each of the Five Sense Media (eye, nose, ear, tongue and body). The Sixth Consciousness (Manovijnana), postulating external “objects”, corresponds to the Five Sense Bases or “sense objects.” The Seventh Consciousness (Manas) is the afflicted consciousness that postulates a truly existent subject or “I.” Alayavijnana is the eighth of the Eight Consciousnesses which is the nature of mind, Emptiness, Prajnaparamita, Mahamudra, etc. The sense-Vijnanas, the Manovijnana and the Manas are mutually conditioned by the Three Poisons (ignorances, attachment and aversion), and, together, these constitute the basis (alaya with a little “a”) for samsara. The prime mover is the Manovijnana-Manas dynamic. Thus, the Alaya is not afflicted.

Malcolm wrote:
The ālayavijñāna is afflicted since it stores the bijas of affliction.


deepbluehum said:
Thus, the Alaya is neither perceived by the ignorant, apprehended, nor obscured. All the apprehension and obscuration is occurring from the seventh consciousness and below.

Malcolm wrote:
Once all the traces have been eradicated, the ālayavijñāna disappears.

There is a difference between the ālaya discussed in Mahāmudra teachings and the ālayavijñāna. However in Dzogchen teachings, the ālaya is also considered afflicted. In Dzogchen ālaya = avidyā.

It cannot be stoppped. Without animals, agriculture is not possible. For example, all commercial organic agiculture uses millons of ton of feather meal, bone meal and blood meal.

All farming results in millions of rodent, bird, and insect deaths.

So even when you eat your rice cake, you still have to do so with mindfulness of all the animals that died to bring that good to your table. So when you understand things in this way, then you understand that the arguments against eating meat are essentially silly and vain.

The only positive argument against eating meat is health. The way we consume meat in Western Industrial Soceiety is not healthy. But the idea that eschewing meat stops the process of death is deluded.

When we eat meat (or anything else) mindfully, we create a connection with all those animals through our shared rtsal energy. That gives them a connection to meet the teachings through us.

Completely. He is saying that the animal is already dead and refusing to purchase meat based on some fantasy that this will prevent the future slaughter of animals is therefore a fantasy-based decision. Worse, it means that from a Dzogchen POV, you are abandoning animals to limitless suffering. He says, and said last night that buying meats like sausage is even better since it is made from many animals and not just one. When you use this meat in a ganapuja, you create possibilities for that animal to be reborn as your student, etc.

Listen to his webcast from last night where he clearly addressed all of this, including criticisms directed at Dzogchen pracitioners who advocate meat-eating as a compassionate thing.

With all that I said before, in my previous post....I have a sort of bone to pick.
Before I say anything though let me preface it with this:
ChNN is amazing!!  His teaching is amazing (method and introduction).

The community though, in my very weak and humble opinion, could use some work.  I came out here to Pasadena, CA, from SLC, UT (there are NO other D.C. members in SLC that I know of), alone for this retreat...and I guess I shouldn't complain, because I did come out to meet ChNN and receive teachings in person.  However, the community has been quite oddly 'distant' overall.  People have been kind, polite, and genuinely 'nice', but have remained at a distance from me (and I assume from other loners at this event).  I have remained a loner the entire time at this retreat.  I have attempted several times to try to start conversations to get to know people and start to 'experience' the Dzogchen Community.  I have been a member since 2008 and this is the first time I have had the chance to interact and relate with other members of the community in person.  I don't feel like I am socially inadequate or awkward.  Maybe a bit shy at times, but I tend to be able to make 'friends' fairly easily and am able to carry a conversation.  I feel like I somehow, somewhere, missed some 'boat' though.  The longest conversation I had was about 2 minutes and everybody seemed interested in ending our little chat as quickly as possible.  It just struck me as odd.

Perhaps, the issue is one of expectation that should be dropped....A close friend of mine, I talked to via the internet tonight about this topic told me, "it's a great time to experience working with your own condition"...TRUE!  But I can't help but feeling a bit disappointed.  This is suppose to be a community, it's very name is such, the Dzogchen Community.  In my opinion, it doesn't feel much like a community, but more of a 'fend for yourself' 'feel/mentality'.  Perhaps it's just the mixture of people at this particular area/retreat?  I don't want this post to come across as harsh....I love ChNN, the teaching, and the Community (at least with my limited digital contact) and was hoping that the experience would be reciprocal from the community.  Apparently, this is an issue that exists in my mind as it is a judgement, a part of dualistic vision, and should be dropped.

So, what am I going to do, besides be aware of the judgement, emotion etc... and let it self liberate?  Well, if I am ever fortunate enough to be at a D.C. event again, retreat, teachings, practice, etc.... I will make it a point to find that loner or 'newb' and welcome him/her and try to help them get their bearings, answer questions, get to know them, even invite them out for a lunch or dinner (if appropriate for the situation) and be as much like a 'community' member as possible, because I don't want another to have the experience that I have had with something that is so dear to me.  I would challenge all D.C. members to do the same.

Much Love, Light, and Bows....

I am a bit shocked but I guess I have not been following your postings of closely enough of late.
So in fact you see all those many years of learning Tibetan, studying the Sakya systems, translating those texts
and investigating the abhidharmakosha etc. as a waste of time. You think you would have been better off
just resting in your natural state.
OR Did it take that much to get to this point?

It is a bit discouraging to hear, somehow. For me personally, I couldn't imagine jumping into these formless
meditations without a sort of gradual progression. I guess according to the Dzogchen presentation I am a
dull faculty disciple. If I did think all the rest was unncessary, I wouldn't have busted
my butt these last few years learning Tibetan and translation. I really feel what Geshe la teaches me now
is what will allow these formless things to make sense in the future.

Malcolm wrote:
Oh, don't get me wrong, I still enjoy reading texts like the Kosha and so on, but I am not longer under the il/delusion that liberation lies in that direction. Studying medieval philsophy, while entertaining, is a hobby.

As I said elsewhere, for Dzogchen all you really need to understand is the five poisons, the five elements, body, voice and mind, as well as the eight examples of illusion. That is about the extent of "abidharma" and madhyamaka you need to understand. You do not even need to understand the five aggregates, etc.

This dawned on me in April when I was teaching a course on Tibetan Medicine (which is all about the five elements and how they create, maintain and destroy the body) and realized that in all the thousands of pages of Tibetan texts I have translated and read of original Dzogchen material, apart from the five poisons, the vast portion of other topics in Abhidharma, the complex pirouettes of Abhisamaya, the scheme of the two truths and so on, is more or less completely absent in Dzogchen tantras apart from when they are criticizing these schemes or presenting the views of the different yānas.

Of course the Dzogchen tantras themselves deal with the doctrines of other yānas, mostly critically. And of course to be a translator of Dzogchen texts etc., yes, you need to study everything from the three vows all the way up the ladder -- especially if you want to become enmeshed in the texts of Longchenpa. So in answer to your other question, I am not sorry for having studied anything. All study can be taken with you into your next life. I am a "knowledge friendly anti-intellectual" these days.

To practice Dzogchen, you need to study very little. You just need to receive transmission from a qualified master (cannot underestimate the importance of that) and then go practice. If you think you need to study many things to understand Dzogchen then you are wasting your time. Why can I say this? Because many simple, uneducated people have acheived total liberation through Dzogchen teachings. Butchers, hunters, farmers, stone carvers, laborers of all kinds, people who did not spend years in retreat learning complicated practices and doctrines.

Dzogchen boils down to rigpa and marigpa i.e. knowledge or ignorance of the real condition of your body speech and mind which is created out of the five elements [yes mind too is a created out of the five elements].

Malcolm this actually brings up an interesting point.  I tried looking at some dzogchen tantras in the Nyingma Gyudbum, and they were handwritten -- difficult to read and containing a lot of scribal mistakes.  Many criticize the bible for being so rife with scribal errors compounded one upon the other that it could hardly reflect the early documents it purports to represent... and perhaps intentionally distorted in places.

Malcolm wrote:
The Adzom Chogar edition of the seveteen tantras is the best; it is based on the Derge edition and provides all the alternate readings. For example, there were at least three manuscript traditions of the Rangshar -- the one in the Tingskye/Tsham brag edition is has differences in certain respects from the Adzom Chogar and is based on only one manuscript tradition.

Yudron said:
Now, I don't know why you look at the Dzogchen tantras from a religious view when you are eschewing religion

Malcolm wrote:
I don't "beleive" in the Dzogchen tantras, I have personal experience of what they are discussing (no this does not mean I am a realized person). So I don't look at them from a religious point of view -- they are experiential manuals.

Yudron said:
but clearly you believe, as I do, that they are not Tibetan inventions.

Malcolm wrote:
There are features of the Man ngag sde tantras that can only exist in native Tibetan compositions.

My view of the Dzogchen tantras is that they are human compositions, relative, and so confined in space and time to this epoch. For example, the Rangshar  was taught by the primordial master Zhonnu Pawo Tobdan. But it also mentions Shankaracaraya and Kumarila who are both from the 7th-8th century. So when it was set down or recounted, in the enumeration of views, Vimalamitra or someone else, if it is really a translation, mentioned these Hindu masters who were of recent fame. So I think that the Dzogchen tantras have multiple layers and multiple authors. And this also does not mean that they do not have an oral origin in a guy named  Garab Dorje -- we simply do not know.

But faith in the historicity of Garab Dorje, or the veracity of the traditional lineage account is unecessary for the pratice Dzogchen. Even if Dzogchen were invented yesterday by Eckhart Tolle, it would still be a verifiable personal experience one can have.

For example, the Rangshar's colophon holds that Vimalamitra translated the text using copies in three languages, that of Sanskrit, Oḍḍiyānese, and rgya nag, which at the time, probably meant Central Asia(according to Hansen-Barber), but usually is understood as China by modern Tibetans. This is strange and interesting.

Yudron said:
So, we believe...they are not just 1,000 years old, but 2,000 or more years old.

Malcolm wrote:
I am not sure of that. All we know for sure is that around this literature emerged in the tenth century. We have no text datable prior to the tenth century apart from the Guhyagarbha tantra -- this is because Samyas burned down. Even so, the 17 tantras were supposedly confined to a single edition discovered by Dangma Lhungyal and given to Chetsun. Chetsun gave them to Zhangton in 1128 along with the Vima Nyinthig. He also gave them to Chegom who revealed some other interesting tantras (which are in NGB) that show up in slightly different recensions Gongpa Zangthal. At that time, Terma revelations were not so codified the way they are now. The colophons of the texts in the zangs yig can for example recommend that the pratitioner himself conceal the texts for later times if he cannot find a suitable disciple.

Yudron said:
With each edition there have been scribal errors and edits by well-intentioned lamas trying to figure out what needs correcting--probably dozens of editions.  Whomever Garab Dorje was, living in whatever era he did, what we have now as Dzogchen tantras clearly are not what he received from Vajrasattva.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct, these texts have been subject to emendation and addition. One thing, Garab Dorje was a nirmanakāya -- his speech is Vajrasattva and his mind is Samanabhadra. The three kāyas are inseperable -- so the Samantabhadra --> Vajrasattva --> Garab Dorje lineage thing is just a literary device, and not meant to be taken literally, IMO.

Yudron said:
Did I read somewhere that Jim Valby inputted a critical edition of the main 17 tantras?

In any event, while very interested in the current redaction of these ancient documents, I place my faith in the personal menngak from current Buddhas who have accomplished the path in the present.

Malcolm wrote:
All the 17 tantras have been put on line in wylie, Valby's edition. They are a not a critical edition. For some tantras, he input parallel copies, which is better than "critical editions".

My present understanding of Dzogchen is entirely due primarily to the kindness of Chogyal Namkhai Norbu and Kunzang Dechen Lingpa, which is not to discount the kindness of othe teachers.

My remark concerned Dalton, not Nubchen.

Anyway, the nine yānas are not a problem, since they include the tirthika vehicles as well, following the scheme laid out in the sgra thal gyur (first yāna, yāna of gods and humans).

The nine yānas are not reflective of the hostility Dzogchen recevied in Tibet, nor the continuing hostility Dzogchen has been subjected to in various Buddhist quarters, Sakya, Kagyu as well as Kadampa/Gelug.

The Bonpos, contrary to the post 10th century mythology of the imperial period, were never hostile to Dzogchen despite the fact that they definitely pushed back against in the three way political contest between Chinese influence, Indian influence, and native traditions.

It is funny you know: in the colophon of the Rigpa Rangshar tantra, when Trisrong Detsen is presenting the Rigpa Rangshar to Nyanbang he says “This [tantra] is evil mantra (ngan sngags) that will ruin Tibet. If Tibet comes to ruin, you should move this outside of it.”

What is hilarious about this of course is that the Rigpa Rangshar barely contains any mantras, has no methods of liberation or union, etc., and discusses the four empowerments of man ngag sde in only the barest of terms. But the message is Dzogchen is that anyone can understand it and practice it (providing they have transmission of course). This is threatening to Indian/Kadampa style gradualism that has come to dominate all schools of Tibetan Buddhism including modern Nyingma and Bon.

But I don't think that termas are necessarily reflective of some conventional historical factual event.

Of course the evolutuon of the terma tradition is poorly understood, even by Tibetans. However, if we look at the first account of the terma tradition, i.e. the one written by Guru Chowang, this can give us some clarity. Also looking at the colophons of the Vima Nyinthig and the 17 tantras, etc, will bring clarity, as well as looking at the Bonpo termas tradition which is arguably earlier than the Buddhist one.

Dzogchen is not a school or sect, or a religious system. It is simply a state of knowledge which masters have transmitted beyond any limits of sect or monastic tradition.
Chogyal Namkhai Norbu. Dzogchen: The Self-Perfected State (Kindle Locations 171-172). Kindle Edition.
A monk, without giving up his vows, can perfectly well practice Dzogchen, as can a Catholic priest, a clerk, a workman, and so on, without having to abandon their role in society, because Dzogchen does not change people from the outside.
Chogyal Namkhai Norbu. Dzogchen: The Self-Perfected State (Kindle Locations 183-184). Kindle Edition.
Every religion, every spiritual teaching, has its basic philosophical principles, its characteristic way of seeing things. Within the philosophy of Buddhism alone, for example, there have arisen different systems and traditions, often disagreeing with each other only over subtleties of interpretation of the fundamental principles. In Tibet these philosophical controversies have lasted up until the present day, and the resulting polemical writings now form a whole body of literature in itself. But in Dzogchen no importance at all is attached to philosophical opinions and convictions. The way of seeing in Dzogchen is not based on intellectual knowledge, but on an awareness of the individual's own true condition.
Chogyal Namkhai Norbu. Dzogchen: The Self-Perfected State (Kindle Locations 185-189). Kindle Edition.
All our concepts and beliefs, no matter how profound they may seem, are like nets which trap us in dualism. When we discover our limits we have to try to overcome them, untying ourselves from whatever type of religious, political, or social conviction may condition us.
Chogyal Namkhai Norbu. Dzogchen: The Self-Perfected State (Kindle Locations 193-195). Kindle Edition.
For example, those who already have a certain familiarity with Tibetan culture might think that to practice Dzogchen you have to convert to either Buddhism or Bon, because Dzogchen has been spread through these two religious traditions. This shows how limited our way of thinking is.

"Buddha Shakyamuni did not directly teach Dzogchen. Not only  Buddha Sakyamuni, but some of the other twelve teachers did not directly give Dzogchen teachings. They communicated indirectly because the essence of their teaching is Dzogchen."

Avoiding both these extremes, the Tathagata (the Perfect One) has realized the Middle Path; it gives vision, gives knowledge, and leads to calm, to insight, to enlightenment and to Nibbana. And what is that Middle Path realized by the Tathagata...? It is the Noble Eightfold path, and nothing else, namely: right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness and right concentration

So a Dharmic Swedish culture of sorts.  And we change culture worldwide over a several century period to reflect this Dharmic culture.  This is not imposed on top of local culture per se but aspects of local culture are diminished that would lead to negative action and aspects of local culture that promote peace and kindness are enhanced.  So over time, all cultures become bodhisattvic in their own way.

heart,

I'll quote Malcom as this reply of his fits your comments about using the traditional ngöndro to get rid of doubt.

More, SMS base level is not particularly related to Garab Dorje's second statement.

heart said:
So it is connected with his first statement? Seem so you didn't get my point, what practice you do don't necessary correspond with any of the the three statements so I think when ChNNR says that Garab Dorje didn't say "first do the Ngondro" that is just a joke because for sure he didn't say "first do Guru Yoga with a white Ah" either nor did he say "first do lodjongs, semdzins and rushan" or "first do Semde" or any other method at all. It is between you and your Guru what you do and when.

No, he said "direct introduction". Why? Beause in Dzogchen Buddhahood exists to be demonstrated. If it is not demonstrated, there is no liberation, even though it is present from the beginning.

So, there is a path to discovering this knowledge, but it is not really gradual in the sense of gathering the two accumulations and so on as in sutra and tantra.
The understanding is not gradual, nobody said so. But it takes an entire life to become so familiar with the dynamic nature of the state to reach its ultimate expression. So it's gradual. Those who went from the 1st to the 4th vision are more than quite rare in the entire history of Dzogchen. For the 99,99 per cent remaining, including giganticly advanced masters, there is a path to follow. This Path is explained in the entire Dzogchen literature and it's its purpose. Any Path is gradual, even terribly abrupt ones. This is why Trekcho is a View and Thogel a Meditation (or a Path depending on authors).

Malcolm wrote:
Anyone can have the first vision. Most people manage the second vision with relative ease. Many, though less, even manage the third.

For example, the Rigpa Rangshar has a detailed presentation of the 21 capacities. Only the best of the best acheive the body of light in this lifetime. Most of the rest acheive buddhahood in the bardo after varying length of time after death. The rest take rebirth in the pure nirmanakāya buddhafields.

The energy of the wisdom of rigpa neither increases nor does it decrease regardless of the four visions.

The "path" in Dzogchen is not like "path" in other systems, where you start out from point a and wind up at point b. The "path" of Dzogchen is simple removing the jaundice of ignorance so you see what is there all along from the begining. It is not about acquiring something new you did have before.

It could only be gradual if you consider sems sde gradual (it isn't). Instead, it is scheme outlining the intention of the three series in very broad strokes.

Dzogchen is a kind of knowledge: you either have it or you don't. To the extent that there is a path in Dzogchen, that path consists of discovering what you have not discovered. This is the reason for the special preliminaries as I am sure you will agree.

Garab Dorje's Testament is strictly an Upadesha, as can be seen in the commentaries by Dza Patrul and others. This is not a text dealing with Semde or Longde. Only ChNN Rinpoche interprets it as a gradual approach to Dzogchen. THis is not the case with any other master alive or in the past. I don't mean it's wrong, it's just simply not the case. His gradual approach to the Testament of Garab Dorje is not the traditional one.


Malcolm wrote:
That is correct, ChNN clearly states that his equation of the three statements with sems sde, klong sde, and man ngag sde is based on his dreams and is not an explanation one will find in any other master's teachings.

However, it is not a gradual approach. Nothing in Dzogchen is gradual. If it is gradual, it is not Dzogchen, even if it is useful.

While what you say is true, in general Dzogchen is not "secret"; ChNN also regularly reminds people that Dzogchen practices are not to be shared with people who do not have the proper transmission. "Secret" and samaya are different. "Secret" means that no one should know. Samaya means that you can discuss with people who have same transmission. "rgya rgya rgya" means that you should maintain the samaya of body, of speech, and of mind with regard to the teachings. It just means to take care to not share them with people who are not interested, to not think to do so, speak about them, or show them with your body.

I was not criticizing you -- I was trying to bring some clarity to the issue of "secret" as opposed to what is appropriate to share. I think in general people in Dzogchen confuse the idea with "secret" with samaya. There is very little in Dzogchgen that is "secret" unlike tantric practices. There are many things in Vajrayāna that are secret in a concrete way. But it is not like that in Dzogchen. So we are in broad agreement. I just wanted to clarify that while Dzogchen is not secret, we still have samaya not to share things with people who are not interested.

[EDIT: mutsuk's off topic comments removed] As Malcolm have told you before, JLA's description of the traditional Dzogchen curriculum (in his book on Khenpo Gangshar) is the same as that of SMS. JLA is not forwarding his own program as you claim everywhere but the traditional program. Period. Or you have to concede that Yongdzin Rinpoche and many other masters are not qualified, serious, etc., in your own view. But hey, how long have you been into Dzogchen and still not distinguish the state and the individual ?


Malcolm wrote:
While it is true that in SMS there is a gradual way proceeding in the base and the first level, it is hyper-abbreviated compared to the traditional approach, the emphasis being on gaining experience in each of the topics. The practice amounts recommended are just recommendations, with a minimum of a week for somethings, and a day for other things.

But the important thing to remember is that SMS is not mandatory, and everything that ChNN teaches in SMS he also teaches in other contexts. SMS was originally designed for teacher training -- and is a comprehensive approach to the various systems found in Dzogchen.

Also, his longsal cycle is a completely different -- and is not connected with SMS at all.

Yes. Like the Four Tantra's (in which respect is paid to Bonpos in terms of which tradition to which one should resort when doing rites to dipell provocations), the Aṣṭangahridaya Samhita is a text, which while authored by a follower of Buddhadharma, pays respect to Brahmins and others in terms of the customs a patient might use as their spiritual support.

All translators, like all writers, have judgments and views which they can not stop coming across. Also every translation, or any writing, affects each reader uniquely.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, that is true. I just try to translate the text as accurately as I can, taking the meaning into account first. Thus, when I see a term like sang rgyas I just translate it as Buddha, buddhahood, etc. without making too much judgment unless there is a play on words in the text.

Actually for all the recent sturm and drung about this and that "view" of mine, I really try very hard to be as transparent in my translations as possible. Of course, you are right, I have to make choices, but I hope that my choices based on my 23 years as a Dharma practitioner are informed primarily by my practice of these teachings. To be honest, the greatest single thing that changed the way I linguistically looked at Dzogchen texts in particular was studying Tibetan Medicine. Dzogchen language, like the language of medicine is not static, it is dynamic, process-oriented, where as the language of Madhyamaka, Abhidharma, etc., is very static.

One thing people forget is that there is a close connection with Dzogchen and Tibetan doctors. Even Chetsun Senge Wangchuk was a doctor, and many great tertons, like Rigdzin Godem, Rigzin Jatson Nyingpo, Kongtrul, Khyentse, etc., were skilled physicians.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, this is all great, but in Vajrayāna students are disempowered in all kinds of direct and indirect fashions which makes examining teachers for proper qualities damn near impossible. Students are put in the catch-22 of comitting to lamas they do not know or missing out entirely because they do not trust the situation. For the most part, the cultural hierarchies that Tibetan Buddhism is embedded within make it virtually impossible to for students, especially beginning students to have a clear picture of their teachers. These memes and hierarchies are also exploited by western teachers. And this is not merely a problem in Vajrayāna, this is also a problem in Zen. (In Theravada it is a little more clear since lay teachers are compartively rare and monastic precepts are highly valued.) The of course there is the taboo again criticizing any lama from whom one has received transmission no matter how egregious their behavior has been. This taboo is actually more enforced by students than lamas. So there is enormous peer pressure within dysfunctional groups to regard the pathological behavior of Dipshit Rinpoche, etc., as "awakened activity".

So frankly, while I can appreciate the caveat emptor approach, we are too quick to divorce gurus from their own personal responsibilty to their students when we insist it is all on the student.

Not really xylem-- the motive is really quite different. In Sutrayāna teachings, desire for example is regarded as poison, etc. Dzogchen is not a path of renunciation, as you know.

If they were able to see the arisal of lust or anger as the adornment of wisdom and really rest in that then there would be no problem.  But most people can't do that.

In what way do you think plants have perception, as described canonically in my post?  Blue, yellow, hot, cold, smooth, sharp, rough, etc.  Do you think that the perceptions take place being expressed through this theoretical plant-brain network?  How does a plant designate, or label what is yellow or green, what is smooth or hard, how does it mark an experience and retain recognition of that experience?  I'm not saying I "know" they don't perceive, but, there's no evidence for perception, need for it, and the scientific observations actually oppose perception.  What's more, the canonical resources never insinuate a need for perceptual, karmic, plant sentience.

Against Perception:
Trees experience strong wind or weak wind, but what in the tree designates, "this is strong and this is weak?"  It does not make a mark, "these are the designations of wind that I have experienced."  It responds to the wind chemically over and over.  The rosemary bush, when having a leaf plucked, does not designate that sense in any way, "the leaf was plucked," and mark it for later recognition, so that when another leaf is cut, it refers to that same mark of designation.  One leaf is cut, then another leaf is cut, and another and another and so forth, but the plant just reacts according to the experience and doesn't empirically memorize the suggestion of losing leaves.  It doesn't need to, because the leaves are lost in Fall, and leaves regrow in Spring.  It just happens, inherently.  Therefore there is no volition, which means there is no pretense of volition, no karma, and therefore cannot be previous life nor rebirth, and no stream of karmic consciousness, reproductive consciousness.

These living beings are thus "primitive sentient," or, "proto-sentient, sub-sentient."  There is substratum consciousness, but it lacks the obscuring consciousness and there is no karmic tainting that displays storehouse consciousnesses.  In other words, they have empty storehouse consciousness, and the only reason they're able to be sentient living beings at all, is because the primordial substratum consciousness provides contact between "sense base" and "sense object."  So they lake perceiving and mental formation, and there's no presence of continual consciousness, only "projected."

In order for a plant to have consciousness "of its own, storehouse consciousness," volitions or mental formation must give rise to that.  They don't intend and obsess over objects, they don't "form volition" in the mind, there is no coloring of the mind derived from sensations.  They do not apprehend the quality of sense-objects, and color their own mind in that way.  They simply react to it naturally, there is no coloring or intention and obsessions over the objects, it's an impersonal experience.  So, personal sentient consciousness can't arise here, dependent on mental formations.

Malcolm wrote:
As befits their modular structure and the ability to grow from each of their modules,
unlike animals, plants have no use for a centralized brain and/or nervous
system. Instead of centralized brain tissue, a newly emerging field of plant science,
dubbed “plant neurobiology,” is suggesting that plants may actually have
thousands of brain-like entities that are involved in the emergence of intelligent
behavior. These entities are a type of tissue known as meristems. Current theories
suggest that the meristematic tissue, located at the tips of roots and shoots, combined
with the vascular strands capable of complex molecular and electrical signalling,
may well comprise the plant equivalent of the nervous/neuronal
system.54 In a groundbreaking text Communication in Plants, Baluška et al. echo
the pioneering work of Darwin:
Each root apex is proposed to harbour brain-like units of the nervous
system of plants. The number of root apices in the plant body is high,
and all “brain units” are interconnected via vascular strands (plant neurons)
with their polarly-transported auxin (plant neurotransmitter), to
form a serial (parallel) neuronal system of plants.55
Rather than following Darwin’s judgement that this plant nervous system is inferior
to that found in animals, plant neurobiology researchers regard this decentralized
assessment and response system to be the most effective for maximizing
plant fitness.56 Such a system is thought to enable decentralized behavior (i.e.,
growth), which allows plants to thrive in complex and everchanging rhizospheric
environments.
It has been proposed that in the plant the meristematic “brains” may exert
influence on the rest of the plant tissue by the transmission of signalling molecules
such as the hormone auxin. Auxins are manufactured at the root and shoot
apices, and it is thought that their movement is one method for allowing the
transfer of information throughout the individual. It has been proposed that the
end poles (cross walls of cells) are analogous to the synapse in animals.57 At so
called “plant synapses,” vesicular transport of auxin moves this signalling molecule
from cell to cell. Although the exact processes have yet to be uncovered, it
has been proposed that this extracellular transport of auxin “exerts rapid electrical
responses” across the plant synapse and “initiates the electrical responses of
plant cells.”58 Whatever the pathway within the plant, communication can occur
over long-distances, with information on the environmental and developmental
state of the roots being transferred to the shoots—as in the case of stomatal closure
during water stress. As well as auxin and electrical signals, plants produce
and use a variety of neurotransmitter molecules to communicate from cell to
cell. Dopamine, acetylcholine, glutamate, histamine, and glycine are all touted as
potential signalling chemicals between cells.59 Other complex communication
molecules include protein kinases, minerals, lipids, sugars, gases, and nucleic
acids. Trewavas has drawn attention to this complexity and notes that “from the
current rate of progess, it looks as though communication is likely to be as complex
as that within a [animal] brain.”60
In response to some of the assertions of plant neurobiologists, Alpi et al.
have suggested that the existence of plasmodesmata (microscopic channels, which
traverse plant cell walls and enable transport and communication between cells)
contradicts the idea of plant synapses and of auxin as a neurotransmitter, as their
existence facilitates extensive electrical coupling, precluding the need for any
cell-cell transmission of a neurotransmitter-like compound.61 However, this criticism
has been refuted by Brenner et al., who assert that although the exact pathways
are still to be discovered, auxin is known to be transported from cell-cell
and active, communicative plant behavior does take place.62 Along with the
exact mechanisms of electrical cell-cell coupling, they assert that investigating
these transfers represents an exciting field of study for understanding plant signalling
and behavior.
With thousands of meristems, a plant has potentially thousands of “brain
units.” It is proposed by advocates of plant neurobiology that plants integrate
sensory information and make decisions based upon communication between a
multitude of plant tissues such as the root meristems, interior meristems, and the
vascular tissues. Barlow has pointed toward the involvement of the vascular
tissue (xylem and phloem) in conveying APs from zones of special sensitivity to
other regions of the plant—an “informational channel” involved in organismal
organization.63 Trewavas has proposed that the meristematic tissue, which runs
throughout the plant, could be an integrative assessment and computational
tissue, acting with sensory input from local meristems.64 With active debate on
this topic, it is still to be uncovered whether this internal communication systems
are centralized, decentralized, or somewhere in between.65
The structural complexity of these communication networks within plants is
of great interest for an understanding of the intelligent behavior that plants display.
The eminent animal physiologist Denis Noble has recently argued that networkstyle
interactions (like those found in plants), actually organize and direct the
activity of all living beings. In The Music of Life, he disputes the view that a unitary,
external mind or self controls and directs the activity of living organisms.66
Against this Cartesian notion, Noble argues that it is decentralized communicative
networks that heterarchically self-organize and direct living activity.
In Noble’s view of systems biology, “there is no single controller.” no single
Cartesian mind substance, which is the director of living systems.67 Instead,
from a systems viewpoint, mental properties such as intelligence, reasoning, and
choice are thought to emerge from the interactions of physiological networks of
signalling and communication. As Evan Thompson puts it, the “emergent
process is one that results from collective self-organisation.”68 These principles of
heterarchical organization and the emergence of higher level properties are fundamental
principles of systems biology, which are elegantly summed up by
Fritjof Capra: According to the systems view, the essential properties of an organism,
or living system, are properties of the whole, which none of the parts
have. They arise from the interactions and relationships between the
parts. These properties are destroyed when the system is dissected,
either physically or theoretically, into isolated elements.69
Although the exact pathways are still being investigated, we can state that from a
systems perspective, the interconnecting, heterarchical network of plant tissues
(including meristems) enables intelligent plant behavior, rather than the Cartesian
consciousness or free will alluded to by Struik et al.70

If you look back over the past 7 pages you will find that I have been involved in a discussion on the sentience of plants and not an ideological war on the righteousness of Buddhism and the Buddhist view.  This only occured after you threw out the "heresy watch" accusation.  So can we put it to rest now and get on with the point at hand please?  ie "Are plants sentient?"

Malcolm wrote:
There is nothing intrinsically non-Buddhist about the idea of plant sentience. However the scholastic tradition made it clear that it was uncomfortable with the idea precisely for the same reason you are: what about the karma of eating and killing plants? Thus, the resulting judgment that plants are insentient is truly just a utilitarian claim meant to ease the consciousness of Buddhist scholastics. Because it is certain that common people in India continued to regard plants as sentient, and do so up to the present.

Since you have a background in biology, Matthew Hall suggests that the problem in adressing plant sentience is a function of entrenched zoocentrism in cognitive modeling which begins with Aristotle. When the question gets brought up, the immediate response is "where is the nervous system, where is the brain, etc." It does not occur to people to ask "If plants are sentient, how might plant neurobiology differ from zoomorphic neurobiology?" In particular, in Hall's book on page 147 he discusses the issues of plant brains.

The conceptual problem, as I see it, is that in Buddhism we have substituted "consciousness" for a soul, or a living being (jiva). But Buddhism no more moves away from a decentralized notion of sentience that does Aristotle. Truthfully, there really is not much difference between the idea of a transmigrating consciousness as the irreducible fact of a sentient being and a soul (despite the chorus of protests this will raise). A transmigrating consciousness transmigrates precisely because of the delusion of selfhood. We take rebirth because we are deluded about I-ness. The only difference between the early Buddhist anatman and the Hindu atman is what is taken as identity. The Hindus understand all persons and phenomena as lacking identity, but suppose that underneath all these illusory appearances, there is a permanent sat-cit-ananda, whose definition is very much like the Mahāyāna definition of tathagatagarbha i.e. permanent, self, blissful, and pure.

The issue, as I see it, is that the substance dualism implicit in the way scholastic Buddhists treat namarūpa make a systems theory of consciousness impossible. This is not an issue in Dzogchen (and to a lesser extent, in Vajrayāna), because consciousness itself is a product of systems interactions i.e. the interactions of the five elements in the body and so on.

What I propose is that the language of plant devas in Buddhist literature is used as a device to ameliorate karmic responsibility for using plants as food. Certainly, in animist traditions where plant spirits are considered, it is not like that. We consult with the spirit of the plant before using it, just as we consult with the spirits of animals we hunt. When we kill a plant, we do not necessarily kill its spirit, just as when we hunt we do not necessarily kill the spirit of the animal we are hunting. This model is still grounded in a naive substance dualism, but it has the benefit of making us recognize that all our actions of eating involve taking life and the life of one living being is not held to be more important than that of another.

Of course in the East Asian Traditions of Buddhism, plant sentience is also accepted in some quarters. The Shingon views of Kukai are very close to my understanding predicated on Dzogchen teachings:
If plants and trees are devoid of Buddhahood, 
Waves would then be without humidity.
As people may or may not know, I am comitted to the principles of deep ecology/biocentrism, and the denial of plant sentience not in keeping with those principles. If we deny plant sentience, as we do merely on the basis of zoomorphic orthodoxy, we deny the intrinsic value of the great preponderance of biomass on our world and reduce it, in bibical terms, as something merely for our use, biological automata, without sense, without feeling, without intelligence. For many centuries, we regarded animals as mere automata too. Now we understand better. In time, I am certain, we will understand this kind of thinking is a mistake when we consider anything that lives.

Malcolm wrote:
No, because Bodhgaya is part of an impure realm.

What Mipham was saying in fact that as a Dzogchen practitioner he was going to take rebirth in the pure nirmanakāya buddhafields, but not here, on this planet or in this world system.

gregkavarnos said:
Aha!  So what you are saying is not that the three statements are contradictory but that they are complementary.  Yes, I can see that.  So you are saying that the statement:  "...seek me in the northern lands of distant Uttarakuru, and elsewhere, east, west, north and south." is figurative and not literal?


Malcolm wrote:
Uttarakuru, as Mipham surely conceived it, is not this planet.

From the Dzogchen perspective, everything, including consciousness, is a merely a display of the basis' energetic radiance.
I don't find that statement "easier."  I'm not even sure what "easier" means.  But really it's not that critical.  In that frame of speaking, sentience doesn't even come into question, and saying any being is sentient or not sentient is unfounded.

Malcolm wrote:
The point is that all life is a function of rtsal. Since everything is a display of rtsal, the notion of sentient vs. non-sentient is not just an ultimate mistake, but a conventional one as well.

You should examine Plants as People by Hall. Much of this conversation is colored by a trenchant post-Aristotelain zoocentrism.

Plants are sentient, we might just have to revise our understanding of what sentience is.

In this respect Buddhist dogmatics is of no use and should be discarded the same way we have discarded Meru Cosmology.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, in general (but not always) animals used in such ritual sacrifices are then consumed. It is the same actually in Dakshinkali in Katmandhu. From my point of view, blood sacrifices are based on a mistaken concept. But I think anyone from one of this religions where blood sacrifice is common who comes to practice Dzogchen teachings will understand that and eventually cease. However, pleasedo bear in mind that the Lhasa Gvt. hired non-Buddhist priests to sacrifice bulls yearly to satiate the bloodthirsty gods and demons of Tibet prior to 1959.

As for gyalpos, not all gyalpos are "bad". ChNN makes that point frequently.

As I said, any person from any religion, who is interested to study and practice Dzogchen may do so without having to convert to Buddhism.

Anyway, I not going to lend any further dignity to this thread because it was clearly conceived polemically, with religious hostility, and I am not interested persuing this thread any further.

According to Hodge there are two disctinct sections. It seems you are citing from parts that are not regarded as core portions, but rather later interpolations meant to bring the MPNS in line with a more standard "Buddhist read:


However, Dharmakṣema's translation of the Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra extends for a further thirty juan beyond the accepted core text of this sutra. The provenance and authenticity of the Sanskrit text, if such existed, underlying this part of his translation has been debated amongst scholars for decades, with many doubting that it is a text of Indian origin. The chief reasons for this skepticism are these: no traces of a extended Sanskrit text has ever been found, while Sanskrit manuscript fragments of twenty four separate pages distributed right across the core portion of the Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra have been found over the past hundred years in various parts of Asia; no quotations are known from this latter portion in any Indian commentaries or sutra anthologies; and no other translator in China or Tibet ever found Sanskrit copies of this portion.[12]:12-13 The Chinese monk-translator Yijing travelled widely through India and parts South East Asia over a twenty-five year period. In his account of "Eminent Monks who Went West in Search of the Dharma" (大唐西域求法高僧傳 T2066), he mentions that he searched for a copy of the enlarged Mahaparinirvāṇa-sūtra through all that time, but only found manuscripts corresponding to the core portion of this work.[5] For these reasons, textual scholars generally regard the authenticity of the latter portion as dubious: they surmise it may have been a local Central Asian composition at best or else written by Dharmakṣema himself who had both the ability and the motive for doing so.[5]:124-5[14] As a consequence, specialist scholars accept that this latter portion of the Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra translated by Dharmakṣema has no value for the history of the tathāgata-garbha concept and related doctrines during their development in India.[12][6]:163-4

Son of Buddha said:
emptiness isnt considered dharmadhatu  in tathagatagarbha,(the nirvana sutra/Lotus sutra) states it was teachings to help one end tainted individual self(false self) not the actual goal.

Astus said:
Consider these passages from the Nirvana Sutra. Page number is according to the common PDF edition.

"The Truth is the Tathagata. The Tathagata is the True; the True is the Void; the Void is the True; the True is the Buddha-Nature; the Buddha-Nature is the True."
(p. 159)

"O good man! All that is made is not eternal. The Void is not anything made. So, it is eternal. The Buddha-Nature is not what is made. So, it is eternal. "The Void is the Buddha-Nature; the Buddha-Nature is the Tathagata; the Tathagata is not what has been made. What has not been made is Eternal."
(p. 162)

"How does the Bodhisattva meditate on the Void of nature ["prakrti-shunyata" - Emptiness of primordial matter]? This Bodhisattva-mahasattva sees that the original nature of all elements is all void. These are the five skandhas, the 18 realms, the 12 spheres, the Eternal, the non-Eternal, suffering, Bliss, the Pure, the impure, Self, and non-Self. In all such things, he sees no nature of their own. This is how the Bodhisattva-mahasattva meditates on the Void of nature."
(p. 194)

"When the Bodhisattva-mahasattva practises Great Nirvana, he knows and sees the universe and he realises that the real state is all-void and that there is nothing that one possesses, and that there is nothing that has any mode of harmonisation or perception. And what he gains is such a phase [state of realisation] as the unleakable [i.e. undefiled], non-doing, the phantomic, the burning flame of the hot season, and the all-empty phase of a gandharvan castle."
(p. 257)

"He practises "Paramartha-satya" [Ultimate Reality] and the Ultimate Void. Why? Because all Bodhisattvas always thoroughly practise the natures and characteristics of the Void. By practising the Void, he can now know what he did not know in the past. What does he know? He knows that there is no self and what one possesses. All beings have the Buddha-Nature. He knows that by reason of the Buddha-Nature, even the icchantika, when he abandons the mind that he possesses, can indeed attain unsurpassed Enlightenment. Such is not what sravakas and pratyekabuddhas can know."
(p. 282)

"Now, hearing Dharma relates to the 11 shunyatas. Due to these voids, we see no form in anything. Now, hearing Dharma begins with the first aspiration and proceeds up to the ultimate unsurpassed Bodhi Mind. By gaining the first aspiration, one gains Great Nirvana. Through hearing, one does not gain Great Nirvana; by practising, one attains Great Nirvana."
(p. 293)

"What is the True? One knows well the phases of Nirvana, the Buddha-Nature, the Tathagata, Dharma, the priest, the Real State, and the Void. This is what is True."
(p. 296)

"The Buddha-Nature is none other than the All-Void of "Paramartha-satya" [Ultimate Truth]. The All-Void of "Paramartha-satya" is Wisdom. We say "All-Void"."
(p. 318)

"The Middle Path is the Buddha-Nature. For this reason, the Buddha-Nature is Eternal and there is no change. As ignorance overspreads [them], all beings are unable to see. The sravaka and pratyekabuddha see the All-Void of all things. But they do not see the non-Void. Or they see the non-Self of all things, but they do not see the Self. Because of this, they are unable to gain the All-Void of "Paramartha-satya". Since they fail to gain the All-Void of "Paramartha-satya", they fail to enact the Middle Path. Since there is no Middle Path, there is no seeing of the Buddha- Nature."
(p. 319)

"The samadhi resultant from right thinking is right meditation. One abiding in right meditation sees all things as Void. This is right Wisdom. One perfect in right Wisdom segregates his self from all the bonds of defilement. This is Emancipation. "The person who has gained Emancipation praises it to all beings and says that this Emancipation is Eternal and Unchanging. This is the correct praising of Emancipation. This is unsurpassed Mahaparinirvana."
(p. 327)

"The Buddha-Nature of beings is not-one and not-two. The equality spoken of regarding all Buddhas is like the Void. All beings possess it. Anybody who indeed practises the Noble Eightfold Path gains - one should know - a bright view."
(p. 352)

"The Eternal of the Tathagata is the Self. The Dharmakaya "[Dharma-Body]" of the Tathagata is unboundedness, unobstructedness, birthlessness, undyingness, and the eight unmolestednesses. This is the Self. The beings, truth to tell, do not have such a Self and what the Self possesses. Only because of the fact that a person absolutely attains the absoute Void of "Paramartha-satya" do we say the Buddha-Nature."
(p. 389)

"The Buddha-Nature of the being is like the Void. The Void is not past, not future, and not present. it is not in, nor out; it is not within the boundaries of colour, sound, taste, and touch. It is the same with the Buddha-Nature."
(p. 414)

"If there is nothing, this is the Void. The same is the case with the Buddha-Nature, too. O good man! As the Void is empty, it does not fall into the category of the Three Times. As the Buddha-Nature is Eternal, it is not within the category of the Three Times."

In scholastic Buddhism this debate came about because Buddha's teachings were more or less silent on the issue, and there are a couple of passages where the Buddha clearly included plant life as a kind of birth.

This raised a question, and because Jains and Hindus already supported the notion of plant sentience, arch-contrarians that they are, Buddhist scholastics rejected this point of view.

You can for example, rationalize that there are devas that inhabit plants as houses (standard Indo-Tibetan view), but as far as I am concerned this is merely a way of articulating the sentience of plants. It may be the case that plants acheive sentience only in communities, just like our body is not wholly sentient -- to use your example of a branch which can be propagated, also cells from our body may be propagated etc., and we certainly would not necessarily call either sentient in a conventional way.

Likewise, we do not have sentience apart from our embodiment, the community of organisms that make up our body. I think the Buddhist basic view -- the sutrayāna view -- is that we are embodied because we are sentient. Underlying the whole Buddhist rejection of plant sentience is a hard substance dualism.

Dzogchen rejects this substance dualism.

Malcom,

There are many practices and levels of depth the Buddha taught.
However, they do not conflict with each other. We can't compare the teachings.

There are contradiction when we compare teachings and lineages because of depth.
That is why the buddha said to contemplate a teaching and discard teachings one does not understand.
The higher teachings are not meant to be understood intellectually, they must be experienced.

Malcolm wrote:
It is not a question of higher and lower.

But the fact remains is that the two truths and the two stages are not the system of Dzogchen and are irrelevant in Dzogchen.

heart said:
The obvious question is then why ChNNR would teach on the two stages if it is irrelevant in Dzogchen? Not a long time ago you said that it is possible to integrate any religion or belief with the practice of Dzogchen, if I understood you correctly. The two stages and the two truths should then be easy to integrate with Dzogchen, right?
Then you told me yourself that the twos stages are mentioned as practices in the 17 Tantras. The Kunjed Gyalpo is full of references to the two stages even if it is as a way to define the difference between Mahayoga/Anuyoga and Dzogchen I don't think that the word "irrelevant" is at all appropriate.

This is the best thing.

Otherwise, the best thing I can say is: that direct experience is based on direct introduction by a qualified teacher (These days most Dzogchen teachers will be very interested in having you sign on as a Buddhist, but not ChNN). Having received direct introduction, then there are many methods to come to be free of doubt about one's primordial state. Once one is free of doubt, one ceases to worry about buddhahood that is a result of practice and effort, since it does not exist.

It's hard to get across to anyone just what this is, because people want to know instead what it "means." It doesn't mean anything. It's just waking up to the glory of This. If it were a religious issue -- a personal possession, an attainment of "holiness" -- we could argue about who has it and who doesn't.

This is actually basic to the cult stalking I experienced. The cultists were enraged that I said I'd had kensho. Enraged.

There's no way to convince anybody of what they refuse to accept, but if there's someone who claims they know the difference between a person who's had satori and who hasn't, let's hear it!

In that experience, I can say that no it is not.  As a shamanist I can say that it's not at odds with this view.  In fact, according to myself and other shamanists I've interacted with, this completely validates these aspects of shamanism from a Buddhist mentality.  Maybe if you explained what's on your mind?

Malcolm wrote:
There are a lot of different kinds of shamanism -- but specifically, plants have their own energetic resonance. Since we moderns have a deeply ingrained substance dualism, when we see terms like "plant spirits" we assume this means somehow just like a mind appropriates a body, spirits appropriate a given set of plants -- but in my view as a Dzogchen practitioner, it is not like that. So how is it? Humans are living beings, and our consciousness is an expression of how energy is instantiated in our forms. Plants are living beings, and the way energy is instantiated in their forms is not the same as ours, so too with animals, devas, etc. But this energy, call it rtsal, permeates and gives rise to all displays of life in a samsaric context, and buddhas in a nirvanic context. You can set them out them on a band if you like, for example, as some hindus do, tamasic to sattvic with plant inhabiting the tamasic end of the consciousness scale, and liberated beings at the ultimate sattvic end.

To think like a tree can take centuries -- Garab Dorje says "The color of rtsal is green". Without rtsal there is no growth, no flourishing of anything. Rtsal is the root of consciousness. Tree thoughts are not like human thoughts. For most of us, we are closed off. We cannot perceive how a tree thinks, or a mountain, a planet, a solar system, galaxy or universe.

All universes are supposed to be included inside of the body of the mahāsambhogakāya Vairocana Himasagara. Our world system is supposed to be in a billion world system that is part of another system which is in the palm of his hand. Are we truly sentient in that respect? Or are we just neurons, synapses in a massive cosmos spanning Buddha?

I am not advocating substance dualism at all. That is a Buddhist trip. I am saying that plant sentience is articulated through the language of plant "spirits" in the jatakas. And that there is a very clear relationship between the body of the plant and the life of the plant "spirit" in question. Harm one, harm the other.

Likewise, when your body is harmed, also your mind experiences harm.

My point of view is not informed by the early Buddhist tradition -- it is merely that in this period there was no hard and fast doctrinal position about it and even the Abhidharmika Samghabhadra recognizes that in the earliest sources there is no firm opinion to back up the Buddhist rejection of non-Buddhist assertions about plant sentience.

So therefore, when Buddhists such as yourself claim "Plants are not sentient" -- it is actually far more ambiguous than is comfortable for you.

As for my position, everything is made of five elements, and that is permeated with wisdom. Therefore, plant sentience, etc., is perfectly reasonable from my perspective and I don't agree with the scholastic arguments against it.

At a more fundamental level though, it does seem to imply that spirits can embody a vessel in similar fashion to the way we 'embody' a car and move around in it, the step out when we're done with it. I can imagine a similar principle could be applied to spirits and plants.

Which is why I originally asked why the Buddha did not include plants as a seventh realm of samsaric existence if they were considered sentient by him...

Buddha includes "grass and trees" among "birth" i.e. jati.
Know first the grass and trees:
Though they lack self-awareness, 
Their birth is their distinctive mark;
For many are the kinds of birth.
-- Middle Length Discourses of the Buddha, pg. 800

Here, Buddha clearly includes plants among the "born". He continues next with moths up to ants, and so on. But if you read this without bias, he says later, on pg. 806:
Who knows his manifold past lives, 
And sees the heavens and states of woe, 
Who has reached the destruction of birth, 
He is the one I call a bhramin.
Since plants are included among birth here, I see no reason not to understand that they are possible rebirths though lacking self-knowing (na cāpi paṭijānare), also so called formless realm beings lack self-knowing.

Malcom, yes Myceliun Running is a great book full of information. I also consider the fungi world entirely different from any other realm. Having studied and being certified in professional mushroom cultivation by Stamets, I'd have to say the fungi would have more characteristic tendencies of sentience than plants. Also in response to pulling the weeds being displacing the insects home. One is not makeing an area bare, there are other plants and root systems for them to reside in. Which most likely, they "visit" anyway.

I was reflecting this morning sentience is not a function of individual members anyway. It is a function of the interaction of communities, just as our body is a member of a sentient community. It is the interactions of the five elements we can our body through all of its sense organs and so forth than gives rise to our consciousness.

This is why such notions as autopoesis (lhun grub) are critical for going beyond archaic and alienating notions inherent in the mind/matter dichtomy.

Trees communicating and benefiting one another is a cute idea, for sure. Unfortunately it all sounds like speculation, not science. What I find interesting is the idea that trees could communicate through their roots with the help of fungi, but no evidence is presented that they actually do.

Come to think of it, I wouldn't be surprised if this video turned out to be a hoax. But well worth watching.

But Malcolm - this is the kind of indirectness and abandonment of logical thought that is a real problem in discussions.  My point on health care is that the US does not have a health care system (not a universal health care system).  So while President Obama's system is also not a universal health care system, Single Payer is certainly not a legitimate option, other than for powerful or greedy people who simply want to exploit others.  It's this kind of thinking that we should reduce and not encourage.  The US has not always taken an extreme "you are on your own" approach but it seems that it has been moving towards that extreme view since at least the 1st Great Depression (because homeless people and poor people were significnatly maltreated in that period).

In response to Xabir, the idea that plants have "spirits" inhabiting them is as silly as the idea we are a mind inhabiting a body. This is merely a perpetuation of the mind/matter dichtomy, the intractable substance dualism that has infected scholastic Buddhist discourse, with which modern Buddhists authors such as Alan Wallace jump through hoops to vainly defend.

Instead, I prefer to think that matter is intrinsically imbued with intelligence, and that all forms of matter may naturally manifest their intrisic intelligence given proper causes and conditions. In other words, I think the concepts "sentient" vs. "non-sentient" is just an abstraction. The intelligence of matter is a function of self-organization or autopoesis. It used to be the case that we beleived animals to be mere automata. Now we have revised that view, and we consider that while animals demonstrate will, communication, etc., we feel that plants are mere automata -- but this view is also slowly changing.

My present feeling is that we inhabit a living world, and it too has a consciousness that envelops us. In order to make it comprehensible we render it in archtypes like an Earth Goddess, Pritvi, etc. But the world is impermanent, and thus it too is subject to birth, aging, illness and death.

Why would the intelligence of a mountain, a planet, a solar system, a galaxy, a universe resemble that of a human being?

No, because Bodhgaya is part of an impure realm.

What Mipham was saying in fact that as a Dzogchen practitioner he was going to take rebirth in the pure nirmanakāya buddhafields, but not here, on this planet or in this world system.

Cultures arose historically mostly from little groups with mutual language comprehensibility or religious cohesion interacting. This is all embeded in a samsaric context and Tibetan culture is no different at lest on the secular level.

Why do we need to preserve cultures? The majority of cultures that have ever existed on the planet are gone as distinct, labelable entities. Cultures are identities that people attach to. Do cultures serve any real purpose for humans?
