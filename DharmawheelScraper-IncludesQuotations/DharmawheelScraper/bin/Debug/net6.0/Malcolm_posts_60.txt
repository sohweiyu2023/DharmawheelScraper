There is no "ground of being" described in any Buddhist text. The term is not appropriate in Buddhist discourse, and was imported into Dharma by mistake.

The term is a Christian theological term coined by Paul Tillich.

I wrote elsewhere on this site:

Unknown said:
In terms of the origins of the term, it was indeed coined by Tillich to show that "God must be called the infinite power of being which resists the threat of nonbeing." [Systematic Theology, Vol. pg. 64] You can see why such borrowing is tempting, "The ground of being has the character of self-manifestation; it has logos character" [Systematic Theology, Vol.1 pg. 158]

A large problem for people who are approaching Dzogchen is that they fall back into classical western philosophical categories. Indeed, Günther wrote once that Dzogchen essentially is not different than Parmenides's theory that whatever was contingent as non-being and whatever is permanent is being. Tillich writes:

"The Orphics, the Pythagoreans, Anaximander, Heraclitus, and Parmenides were driven to their philosophy by the awareness that the world they encountered lack ultimate reality. But only in Plato does the contrast between existential and the essential being become an ontological and ethical problem. Existence for Plato is the realm of mere opinion, error, and evil. It lacks true reality. True being is essential being and is present in the realm of eternal ideas, i.e., in essences. In order to reach essential being, man must rise above existence. He must return to the essential realm from which he fell into existence, In this way man's existence, is standing out of potentiality, is judged as a fall from what he essentially is. The potential is the essential, and to exist, i.e., to stand out of potentiality, is the lost of true essentiuality...In God there is no difference between essential and existential being. This implies the split is not ultimately valid and that is has no relevance for the ground of being itself. God is eternally what he is. [Systematic Theology, Vol.2 ppg. 21-22]

Examining this kind of presentation that the term "ground of being" arose out of, it is easy to see why those who are not trained in Indo-Tibetan scholastics as well as Western Philosophy will be very attracted to terms like "ground of being" in relationship to the term "basis" or gzhi.

As for the second point, no, the Gelugp's didn't change that. One still should never display the form of Caturmukha Mahākala.

Samayas don't change just because the teachings are brought from one culture to another — for example, the samayas did not change their character because Tibetans imported Vajrayāna from India. Therefore, we should not expect them to be mutable just because we live in the West.

Samayas are something taught in the tantras. Regardless of what others may do, I encourage people to follow them according to how they have been understood.

After the pain went away,  I felt myself little weak for a couple of minutes. But after that i started to feel that I am returning to "normal" state. This may not be entirely related, but Alexander Brezin says in his web archive that if one disparages ones teacher or breaks up with him/her in a negative way (negative way: not keeping polite distance, but just running away with remorse) then it can cause autoimmunological diseases,mental and physical suffering.

This transcends the extreme of provisional insubstantiality-differentiated from the substantial existence of self in terms of the mere non-existence of self-and in so doing, utterly quells all such conceptual complexities.

This great identity is the wisdom body of space-like equality, which exercises mastery over all phenomena.

Son of Buddha said:
Oh your right my bad I posted the wrong thing......


Queen Srimala Sutra
13. Intrinsic Purity of the Mind

"Lord, samsára is based on the Tathágata-garbha. It was with reference to the Tathágata-garbha that the Lord pointed out and explained, '[It is] without limit in the past.' Since there is the Tathágata-garbha, there is reason for speaking of 'cyclical flow' (samsára).

Therefore the Tathágata-garbha is the support, the holder, the base of constructed [Buddha natures] that are non-discrete, not dissociated, and knowing as liberated from the stores [of defilement]; and furthermore is the support, the holder, the base of external constructed natures that are discrete, dissociated, and knowing as not liberated.

Malcolm wrote:
Samsara does not equal conditioned phenomena. Why? Because if it did, there could be no pure conditioned phenomena such as path dharmas. People frequently confuse these two things much to their detriment. In other words, all conditioned phenomena are impermanent, but not all conditioned phenomena are impure.

Furthermore, indeed all conditioned phenomena are intrinsically pure, and it is just this intrinsic purity of the mind that sutras refer to as tathagātatagarbha. It is this purity which is the basis for all buddhaqualities. Translating "atma" as "self" in this context is a misfortunate error when in fact the term simply means "nature" in this context as numerous usages prove. Tagathāgarbha is indeed pure, permanent, blissful, and a nature, but it is not a thing per se., it it also not a "self" and using that term and applying too tathāgatagarbha is just confusing. Further, claiming it is source of impure conditioned phenomena is also a category error. On the other hand, rhetorically samsara can be "based" on tathāgatagarbha since the non-recognition of one's real state does result on wandering in samsara.

The term "ground" (gzhi, sthana) is much misunderstood.

Could you clarify its meaning for us?

Malcolm wrote:
From a version of introduction to my forthcoming book:

dzogchungpa said:
...the generic basis [spyi gzhi], which is initially defined by Vimalamitra in the section on the nidānas as “one’s own unfabricated mind” [rang sems ma bcos pa]. This crucial point made in the text should not be ignored, for it would appear that Vimala’s stance contradicts the modern tendency to interpret the generic basis as a transpersonal entity of some kind, leading to the proposition that “the universe is an intelligent entity” and so on.

Malcolm wrote:
And:

dzogchungpa said:
...what is intended by the term “original basis” [ye gzhi] is a pristine empty cognizance or nous. By the use of the term ye shes as a key descriptor for the basis, Dzogchen texts are referring to a noetic potentiality of consciousness which is innate even when defined as “originally pure” or empty, for otherwise it would become very difficult to account for the arising of buddhas and sentient beings in the second topic, the arising of delusion.

Malcolm wrote:
And:

dzogchungpa said:
The third hard question is the issue of the temporality of the basis. Since time does not apply to the original basis, we must regard the use of terms such as “original,” “primordial” and so on as indicating a state in which time is irrelevant, rather than an actual conventional historical epoch or starting point existing countless infinities of eons ago. From such a perspective the placing of the original basis on a temporal spectrum is therefore a didactic myth. The net effect of this understanding is that the basis is the state of phenomena as they appear, in that all phenomena, both external and internal, appear out of an empty noetic potential.

Malcolm wrote:
And

dzogchungpa said:
Having defined the basis, what is being described is a description of reality just as it is. Buddhas are those who unerringly recognize this, and specifically, the idealized buddha known as Samantabhadra recognizes this not only in absence of a teacher, but without ever becoming a sentient being.

Malcolm wrote:
And:

dzogchungpa said:
The third topic defines sugatagarbha as no other than the basis present in sentient beings. In other words, the sugatagarbha defines how the basis is instantiated in sentient beings, and how vidyā exists in the body.

Malcolm wrote:
And:

dzogchungpa said:
Only the seventh position is considered to be flawless, in that the basis is defined as “great originally purity” (ka dag chen po):
Dharmatā, original purity, is free from all proliferation. Since it is unaffected by ignorance, it is free from all obscurations.

Malcolm wrote:
In reality, the basis really just refers to the union of the two truths:

The Mahāyānapathakrama by Subhagavajra states:
dzogchungpa said:
So called “tantras” are tantras because of connection, and further, because they connected the basis, the method and the result. When divided, there are two kinds— tantras of words and tantras of meaning. Words are sounds. There are three in meaning— the tantra of the basis, the tantra of method and the tantra of the result. Now then, the tantra of the basis is the nature of the two truths; the method is the two stages; and the result is the two kaȳas, the dharmakāya and rūpakāya. Therefore, since the result is obtained when the method is cultivated in dependence on the basis, a tantra is so called because it connects.

Yes it is.  If the academics get something egregiously wrong it is in fact the job of translators and Dharma teachers to correct the issue.  You could publish a paper in something like the Journal of Buddhist Ethics along with a few other translators/Western Dharma teachers. Or you could write an article concerning the misinterpretation and publish it in a magazine like Tricycle.  But this kind of misinterpretation needs to be addressed.

Sorry Kirt, but no. Here is why -- I spent years correcting Dogyal advocates and so no — did I convince anyone of anything? No.

Further, in order to correct someone like the writer of the op-ed, I would have to explain too many details, many of which are bound by samaya (for exampe, how to explain to an outsider the ritual language of extreme violence found in so many protector petitions?).

And as far as correcting Sperling goes, that also is just a waste of time since he won't listen.

Hi,

i got a jenang for an Six armed Mahakala from Rinchen Terdzo (ThukChen Pema GyuTrul Drawa Cycle, not Shangpa Chagdrupa) and thought this should be an Mahayoga/Anuttarayoga empowerment.
On Himalayanart.com there is mentioned that Six armed Mahakala is a Kriyayogatantra practice, which would mean that there a very different commitments for practicing/reciting the Mantra.

Can you help me with some info? Do i need to be vegetarian for reciting the Mantra? Or are there no commitments with jenang?

Most of oil in Iraq is controlled by Kurds or Shiites, that is all there is to it.

The actual refined product never touches shiite hands..........even the crude oil never touches shiite hands cause it goes down the pipeline to the Sunnis.
Which is why the largest oil refinery in Iraq is the Bajji oil refinery in Sunni control.

I think it would be very inappropriate to talk about the teachings of emptiness with someone who doesn't have the correct background to understand it correctly.

I think that explaining emptiness in terms of prajnapti is the best way to lay it out for a beginner because it allows you to lay out the meaning of different teachings in a very explicit way, and it is easy to use prajnapti to describe emptiness in a way that is clearly distinct from both absolutism and nihilism, even to a beginner.

It seemed that those people to whom he had not positive relation they suffered from jealous, hatred, anger with him. How could that be the skillful means? Many people at the time of Sakyamuni Buddha became envious with his fame and because of that they tried to defame him. Even tried to hurt him physically. How could it be the skillful means?

Of course, if the US had offered air support and anti-tank weapons to the only secular force in the region (apart from Assad): the Kurds of Kobane,
We did, do and will do — the main problem in Kobane is the Turks refusing to allow Kurds into Syria to fight ISIS, as far as I understand. Airstrikes are out of the question now because ISIS is in the town.
But, obviously, the US wouldn't want to be seen supporting democratically minded, autonomous, secular forces, would they?  That would be completely out of character.

The main problem is that the Turks want Assad deposed, etc., and refuse to get involved without such assurances. In short, it is a political clusterf, not really a military problem.

It was never the point to pay for the war with oil.  Why do that when you can simply tax the middle class and/or print money? They weren't looking to steal the reserves outright.  They wanted a non-OPEC oil producer with sufficient reserves to keep the taps on and smooth out oil shocks. When you measure cost, it is a zero sum game.  If the US gov't is out USD $1.1 trillion then someone else has it on their balance sheet.  So who is this?  It's a simple matter of cui bono to understand the war rationale. As the 'Rebuilding America's Defenses" paper lays out, 9/11 provided the pretext for a muscular expansion of hard power into a region important for access to petroleum.

It's obviously relevant. Why? Because Suttas have discussions about luminosity wo discussions about all sorts of stages or accumulations. So does Dzogchen, a Mahayana thing. So from a method standpoint, all this Mahayana bluster about bhumis and accumulations is dispensable. If Dzogchen points out luminosity as innate and away from two accumulations and so do Suttas, then buddhas qualities are accounted for not via accumulations but via the innate. Thus, Moggallana and Sariputta's having fallen short of Buddha's level is nothing to do with Mahayana and only to do with their failure to grasp the import of luminosity. In fact, Mahayana also fails to understand this import which is why Dzogchen goes higher in bhumis. This is the most important area for a Buddhist to scrutinize. It's the deepest topic in Buddhism.

Malcolm wrote:
The clarity of the mind is certainly important, but don't mistake the clarity of the mind discussed in the suttas for the luminosity of Mahāyāna.

All the suttas say about luminosity is that the clarity of the mind is not affected by afflictions, nothing more and nothing less.

Even the suttas however maintain that Buddha qualities arise as a result of the merit of length of eons of the Buddha's career as a bodhisattva.

All you have done here is support the fact that Mahāyāna has a more profound analysis of emptiness as well the luminous nature of the mind, none of which are required for stream entry — the only requirement for which is the understanding and realization of the selflessness of the person, not even an understanding of the selflessness of phenomena is required for stream entry in Hināyāna, whereas for Mahāyāna stream entrants, aka first stage bodhisattvas, it is indispensable to realize two-fold emptiness. Even if a hināyāna stream entrant realizes twofold emptiness, this still does not equate with a bodhisattva's realization of the same because a hināyāna stream entrant by definition lacks bodhicitta.

In short, CW, you are confusing and conflating many things, and are creating a kind of goulash out of the teachings.

The corresponding texts could have been recorded by different disciples hearing a discourse by the Buddha; further more, disciples can even hear completely different discourses being spoken by the Buddha at the same time with the same tongue.

Bakmoon said:
I'm willing to accept the possibility of corresponding texts being independent recollections of the same event. I've been open to it since the beginning which is why I prefer to use the term common source rather than proto-text, to leave the door open to such a scenario.

My major point is this: Even in this case, there is still a common source between these two corresponding texts, and that common source is the Buddha himself rather than a proto-text.

If the corresponding texts are the result of a proto-text dating prior to sectarian division then one can conclude that the proto-text dates back prior to the split, but if the corresponding texts are independent compositions referring to a single event then one can make the much stronger and more solid conclusion that the texts actually date from the time when the Buddha was still in living memory. In both of these cases ,that of independent texts and that of descent from a proto-text, the final conclusion is that the source of these texts, whether it be a proto-text or the Buddha himself, can be conclusively dated prior to the splitting between the sects.

Comparative methodology uses the split between the sects as the boundary of the absolute latest the common source between texts must date to, leaving the possibility of them being composed well before that, which in any case, allows one to date a large portion of common material in the Nikayas/Agamas to significantly prior to 100 BCE.

Buddha could emanate a hundred different emanations and teach a hundred different people a hundred different things at the same time.

The notion that two similar texts in the nikayas which clear differences necessarily begin in a single historical event is hugely speculative.

The corresponding texts could have been recorded by different disciples hearing a discourse by the Buddha; further more, disciples can even hear completely different discourses being spoken by the Buddha at the same time with the same tongue.

Isn't the awakening of an Arhat congruent with one of the Bodhisattva stages anyway?

Malcolm wrote:
Only in terms of the elimination of the klesha-avarana. No accumulation of merit is required for the awakening of stream entrants — arhats. Gathering merit in Hinayāna is primarily a job of lay people to attain higher rebirth in samsara. There is no sense one accumulates merit to attain awakening, but the attainment of stream entry itself is considered in Theravada to be the highest merit.

In Mahāyāna merit is accumulated in order to attain the rūpakāya of a buddha. Wisdom is accumulated in order to realize the dharmakāya of a buddha.

Further, while arhats and seventh stage bodhisattvas are equal in terms of elimination of kleśas, they are not equivalent in merit; a seventh stage bodhisattva not only surpasses an arhat in merit, but also in realization. However, even someone who newly has entered Mahāyāna surpasses an arhat in merit, merely for having the actual wish to attain complete buddhahood in order to liberate all sentient beings.

Moreover, there are clear differences in the content of awakening of the Hinayāna path of the seeing and the Mahāyāna path of seeing — this in fact is the subject of the Abhisamaya-alāṃkara, which details the hidden intent of the Prajñāpāramita sūtras.

Sherab Dorje said:
So who here can say, based on experience, that the Sravakayana is not just another stage on the Mahayana path anyway?

Malcolm wrote:
If you want to contextualize the Hinayāna path in relation to the Mahāyāna path, that is fine with me, but I don't think that sits well with Theravadins who generally argue that the awakening in Theravada is every bit as profound and deep as awakening in Mahāyāna. Mahāyānists of course, disagree.

Sherab Dorje said:
I guess that's why the Vajrayana talks about not denigrating followers of the Shravaka and Pratyekabuddha Yana.  Right?

Malcolm wrote:
[/quote][/quote]

The sixth root samaya, not to criticize the yānas means that one should not engage in criticizing any of the yānas with hostility, even non-Buddhist teachings. It basically means saying "this or that yāna is not Dharma," this or that is not the teaching of the Teacher, this is not Vinaya, this is not the word of the Buddha, etc. It means that Vajrayānists must accept all of the Hinayāna, Mahāyāna and Secret Mantra canon as our own [it also means that those who have taken Vajrayāna samaya and nevertheless maintain that Mahāyāna sūtra and tantras are not actually the teaching of the Buddha have completely broken their samaya]. It does not however mean that we are forbidden from distinguishing higher paths from lower paths and so on. Even here, however, when this fault is committed if one criticizes Vajrayāna with hostility the fault is great; if one criticizes Mahāyāna with hostility the fault is medium; if one criticizes the śravakayā, the fault is minor. And of course, any Vajrayāna practitioner should recite Vajrasattva daily in case she or he makes some mistake without realizing it.

As long as we never make the claim that Hinayāna is not capable of liberating a person, we are free from samaya fault of criticizing Hinayāna, even if the term itself means "inferior" vehicle. But if someone says to someone "You will not be able to become liberated through following a Hinayāna school such as Theravada, etc." this indeed is samaya downfall.

I don’t know of any Theravadin who would say that the Buddha did not teach compassion and wisdom. It’s absolutely fundamental. If they are Theravadins, then they have not been within a mile of the Pali discourses. They simply could not form this view if they had. Are you sure that this is not a misunderstood view from the Mahayana that you are projecting onto Theravada practitioners? I have seen similar comments before from Mahayana quarters, which could only be described as ill-informed.

Malcolm wrote:
Indeed, Buddha universally teaches love and compassion.

TRC said:
I think there is another myth that should be dispelled pronto too: Mahayana practitioners do not have a monopoly on motivation for the liberation of other beings (Dan74 has already alluded to this). I know all the rhetoric that gets plastered around about the superior motivation of Mahayana, but it has absolutely no bearing to the reality on the ground. It is just not borne out on a day to day basis, and this is really  the ultimate test. Quite simply the proof is in the pudding, and I see no evidence of this. If anyone has actual evidence, in the here and now, of the results of the superior motivation of Mahayana practitioners over and above those who are being referred to as Hinayana practitioners, please present it. If you can’t, then it just remains in the rhetoric and sectarian posturing basket IMHO.

Malcolm wrote:
The difference lies in the understanding of the motivation for practice, and the consequences which follow the achievement of final nirvana. In short, it is generally held in the Hinayāna schools that once someone enters parinirvana, their stream ceases. They simply are not there.

There is the second issue, already raised, that if someone attains stream entry, within seven lifetimes they will achieve nirvana, permanent cessation.

TRC said:
So to tie this back into the discussion, the term/label Hinayana (toward Theravada) is simply incorrect. And because it is incorrect it is therefore a pejorative term. This is where the offense is because it does not apply to the Theravada tradition.

Malcolm wrote:
No, it is not incorrect because the aspiration to the path of arhatship or pratyekabuddhahood satisfies all of the criteria by which a given path is labeled hinayāna. In short, if your goal is to become an arhat, you are a hinayāna pracitioner.
TRC said:
The words of a mature Vajrayana practitioner support this view:
“…  ‘Hīnayāna’ refers to a critical but strictly limited set of views, practices, and results. The pre-Mahāyāna historical traditions such as the Theravāda are far richer, more complex, and more profound than the definition of ‘Hīnayāna’ would allow. ...The term ‘Hīnayāna’ is thus a stereotype that is useful in talking about a particular stage on the Tibetan Buddhist path, but it is really not appropriate to assume that the Tibetan definition of Hīnayāna identifies a venerable living tradition as the Theravāda or any other historical school …"

Ray, Reginald A (2000) Indestructible Truth: The Living Spirituality of Tibetan Buddhism, p.240

Malcolm wrote:
Ray is quite simply wrong — no ifs, ands or buts. All "eighteen" śravaka schools are routinely termed "hinayāna in Indian Mahāyāna texts. These descriptions have very little to do with criteria established by Tibetans (unlike, for example, the distinction between so called prasanga and svatantra, gzhan stong/rang stong, etc. in Madhyamaka). Tibetans are merely following Indian Mahayānistas in their taxonomies.

Even the presentation of the bodhisattva path amongst the śravaka schools is presented from a hinayāna perspective, with a goal to discourage people from forming that aspiration, with a view that the path of the arhat is more practical, more attainable, and involves less suffering for the practitioner.

To put it plainly, all Tibetan Buddhists belong to a hinayāna, or śravakayāna school, Mulasarvastivada. If their practice is based solely on Vinaya, or Abhidharmakośa, etc., and their goal is to become an arhat or a pratyekabuddha, they are hinayāna practitioners.

To make it even more plain — it is the aspiration or bodhicitta to become an arhat or a pratyekabuddha which is labeled "hinayāna," that and and various schools which present that as the ideal path. It is considered especially negative for bodhisattvas to abandon Mahāyāna bodhicitta out of depression or defeatism and turn towards the bodhicitta of arhats or a pratyekabuddhas.  But it does happen, as in the case of people who take bodhisattva vows, but then give up Mahāyāna for this reason or that and enter Theravada.

The day that someone can show me that the primary aspiration of Theravada and most Thervadins is to become a fully awakened buddhas with thirty major and eighty minor marks, with all the ten powers, four fearlessnesses and the eighteen unique qualities of a Buddha, then at that time I will cease to consider Theravada a hinayāna school like the Mulasarvastivadins, Dharmaguptakas, and such extinct schools as the Mahasamghikas, and so on.

But thus far, no one has ever demonstrated to me that Mahāyāna bodhicitta exists in Theravada in general. The issue is not really about love and compassion — we understand that Arhats have limitless love and compassion for sentient beings for as long as they are not in a state of cessation. But when they enter cessation, they abandon sentient beings and that is their primary flaw, among other flaws well described even by such authors as Vasubandhu in the Kośa, such as the possession of non-afflictive ignorance and so on.

They're both bad terms because in reality, there are very few of us who even live perfectly up to the ideal of Buddha's teaching that is shared in common between Theravada, Mahayana, or Vajrayana. Moreover, neither term is true. So belittling any other school via giving it a derisive label really has no place anywhere but sectarian rivalry.


Malcolm wrote:
Unfortunately, when asked the question why it is preferable to desire to be a buddha over an arhat or a pratyekabuddha, the answer is that the awakening of an arhat or a pratyekabuddha is inferior to that of a buddha and so is their path. Likewise, when answering the question of why one would choose Vajrayāna over Mahāyāna even though the result and motivation is the same, again the answer is that the Mahāyāna path is inferior to the Vajrayāna path.

And from the perspective of Dzogchen, all the eight lower yānas are inferior, mostly in terms of lack of directness in the time it takes a beginner to realize complete buddhahood.

So there you have it.

Yes, I think so. For example, commentary tantra of the Guhyasamaja, the Sandhivyākaraṇa states:

Bodhicitta becomes vāyu, 
its form exists in space, 
it is the life of all sentient beings,
it is the nature of the five with ten names,
renowned as the twelve links, 
its nature becomes three, 
the bodhicitta called “vāyu”
this is the chief of consciousness.

Further, another commentary tantra, the Vajramālā, makes it very clear that even between the births, the all-basis consciousness is also inseparable with the mahāprāṇavāyu.

In other words, Vajrayāna texts treat our consciousness in terms of its embodiment in a manner very distinct from lower tantra and sutra.

It means that the classic dualism of namarūpa does not mean that nama and rūpa are inherently different, as philosopher's like Dharmakirti would have it, but rather than there is no state in mind is dissociated from matter. In this respect, Vajrayāna is monistic, though of course in practical discussion, the substance dualism of sūtra dominates even Vajrayāna discussion, obscuring this point for the most part. But when you read texts like the Khandro Nyinthig, or the rdo rje lus sbas bshad by Yanggongpa, it becomes clear that the dualistic approach to mind/body in sūtra and abhidharma is abandoned by Vajrayāna in so far as it explains all of samsara and nirvana are present in the body.

One can't understand what is happening there by thinking that the American oligarchs have the best interests of the American people at heart. The war economy is a way of transferring wealth from the middle class to the wealthy.  The US doesn't need to export to accomplish this.  They simply need to use all the weaponry they have been producing and replace what they have expended.

You misunderstand then — "becoming a buddha to benefit all sentient beings" means becoming a buddha in order to show all sentient beings the way to buddhahood.

No, what I mean is that in order to attain buddhahood, one must remove two obscurations, the kleśa-avarana and the jneya-avarana, respectively, the obscuration of affliction and the obscuration of knowledge.

Therefore I must defer judgement. However; I personally doubt that this "central channel" can be cleansed via mind-only learning alone. I think the whole-body-including-brain must be in a healthy condition for real progress to occur. I therefore view any experience of non-duality - which does not take into account the whole being of a person - as much a head trick for all the good striving for it would do.

I sincerely believe that cleaning the floor is as decent a meditation, on the road of progress towards "non-duality", as cleaning out ones karma.

Not a red herring, it is actually very much to the point — the point being is the division of teachings into Hinayāna and Mahāyāna is very much a mainstream part of how Buddhism is explained in Mahāyāna, where the aspiration to awaken without including the aspiration to achieve full Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings is considered inferior [hina]. There is really no way around it. We can say "śravakayāna" and "pratyekabuddhayāna", but in this case what is the difference? In śravakayāna and pratyekabuddhayāna there is no motivation to awaken beyond considering only one's own benefit. When we compare the two, the śravakayāna and pratyekabuddhayāna motivations are inferior to the motivation of the bodhisattvayāna, hence śravakayāna and pratyekabuddhayāna constitute the hinayāna, and that is all there really is to it. One try and explain it all away with speculations about textual history, but in reality, those of us with commitment to Mahāyāna understand things in this way.

A tactless term with pejorative connotations that those who know better shouldn't use publicly, unless their goal is to increase sectarianism and division between people.

Wikipedia said:
The word Hīnayāna is formed of hīna (हीन):[5] "little," "poor," "inferior," "abandoned," "deficient," "defective;" and yāna (यान):[6] "vehicle", where "vehicle" means "a way of going to enlightenment". The Pali Text Society's Pali-English Dictionary (1921–25) defines hīna in even stronger terms, with a semantic field that includes "poor, miserable; vile, base, abject, contemptible," and "despicable."

...

According to Jan Nattier, it is most likely that the term Hīnayāna post-dates the term Mahāyāna, and was only added at a later date due to antagonism and conflict between bodhisattvas and śrāvakas. The sequence of terms then began with Bodhisattvayāna, which was given the epithet Mahāyāna ("Great Vehicle"). It was only later, after attitudes toward the bodhisattvas and their teachings had become more critical, that the term Hīnayāna was created as a back-formation, contrasting with the already-established term Mahāyāna.[11] The earliest Mahāyāna texts often use the term Mahāyāna as an epithet and synonym for Bodhisattvayāna, but the term Hīnayāna is comparatively rare in early texts, and is usually not found at all in the earliest translations. Therefore, the often-perceived symmetry between Mahāyāna and Hīnayāna can be deceptive, as the terms were not actually coined in relation to one another in the same era.[12]

According to Paul Williams, "the deep-rooted misconception concerning an unfailing, ubiquitous fierce criticism of the Lesser Vehicle by the [Mahāyāna] is not supported by our texts."[13] Williams states that while evidence of conflict is present in some cases, there is also substantial evidence demonstrating peaceful coexistence between the two traditions.[13]

Mkoll said:
I like Mr. Williams' idea of "peaceful coexistence." Using the term "hinayana" in public does not move towards that end.

Malcolm wrote:
This all presumes that these speculations by Nattier have any merit.

The term hinayāna is used over and over again in the Mahāyāna canon to describe pejoratively the goals, motivations and practices of those who aspire to the awakening of śravakas and pratyekabuddhas. It occurs in the PP Sutra in 8000 lines, repeatedly in the Ratnakuta collection, in the general sutra section of the bka' 'gyur, as well as many tantras.

Contrary to popular PC sentiment, the term is used over and over again in Indian Mahāyāna commentarial literature.

In order to understand Indian Mahāyāna you have to understand the use of the term hinayāna and how it is universally used.

If you are a not a Mahāyāna practitioner, you don't need to pay the term any heed. If someone is interested to read Mahāyāna, they are simply going to have to deal with the presence of this term in our canon.

Malcolm wrote:
Mahāyāna describes a motivation behind one's wish for awakening. Simply put, if your actual motivation for awakening does not included the desire to become a Buddha for the benefit of all sentient beings, that motivation is hina, inferior. Not only this, it also describes a view of emptiness, an attitude towards śila that prioritizes the benefit of others over concern for the "purity" of one's discipline, and so on.

Now, just as a Mulasarvastivadin (like all Tibetan Buddhist, upasakas to bhikṣus) can be a Mahāyānista, so can a Theravadin.

But Theravada proper is still a Hinayāna school, as is Mulasarvastivada, because one cannot obtain buddhahood through that school's teachings and because the bodhicitta to become a buddha does not exist in its canon. Yes, it is true that there is an extracanonical approach to the Bodhisattva path borrowed from Mahāyāna, but even here it is constrained by a variety of concepts such as the idea that one can only be a bodhisattva if one is predicted by a Buddha and so on.

The US with the 1st largest nominal economy and close to unconstrained markets (certainly the worship of that) failed in November 2007 resulting in a substantial loss of wealth, millions of people lost everything as a result (including me) and the de facto slave class in American, a class with virtually no economic opportunity, swelled.  I personally will be voting with my feet when I recover.

While Marxism did fail, the Marxist criticism of capitalism is basically valid.  Capitalism can only lead to cycles of boom and bust *a fact acknowledged by all economists I know).  The difference is that capitalist economists since the Keynes Revolution have articulated a philosophy and method to contain that damage and manage the cycles.  This was overturned by Chicago School fanatics who are essentially running the economy of the US at the behest of Ayn Randian fanatics in Congress and in the Fed.  More recently Nassim Nicholas Taleb has demonstrated the weakness of impotence of statically driven economics under the condition of an unusual event.  Taleb is a student of Mandelbrot (who was also one of the teacher's of many of the Chicago School and who was certainly associated with the Chicago School through the 60's) and was a very successful mathematical financier who focuses on unusual or Black-Swan events in his speculation.

You could respond that modern finance has used (Taleb would say overused) statistics to minimize risk but they have used other mathematical models as well (causing the infamous Black-Scholes collapse in the 90's).  While professors Merton and  Scholes rightly won the Nobel Prize for their achievement in pricing, most people using their tools and other tools in financial mathematics don't known what they are doing and are just turning a crank (called sausage machine mathematics).  Market economies are also open to collapses which is one reason that social democracies keep it under control.

If something seems to be a later addition into the Pali Canon as demonstrated by comparative analysis with the other early Canons then I personally don't regard it as being Buddhavacana. Similarly I do not automatically reject things only found in the Sutras from the Agamas. Since you brought up the convenient example of the antarabhāva, I might as well mention my take on it.

I have no problem with an antarabhāva. I think that a lot of these kind of distinctions are just about how you write up your definitions, so what one group might call the antarabhāva another might classify as just being part of the life it comes after. A lot of it is semantics. I personally think there is something like an antarabhāva whatever way you want to classify it or call it just from how rebirth is described, near death experiences, etc... I honestly don't know if the Agamas have anything to say on it, but if they do and there is evidence to indicate that it is of sufficient antiquity, then I would be willing to treat the antarabhāva as being buddhavacana.


Malcolm wrote:
When it comes to the Śravaka canons, my main point that we have very little reason to reject this part of the canon in favor of that part of the canon [as does daverupa for example] on the basis of some supposed antiquity that we can only conjecture about.

These texts are rooted in oral transmission, as you mention, they were recited by professionals who selected portions of sutra, abidharma and vinaya to recite. They were written down. We do not have any proof or evidence of when the Agamas were written down Sanskrit for example, but it was definitely post-Ashoka. The unique conditions of the Pali canon meant that is was preserved to modern times in a more or less complete way, and we can clearly identify those parts that were committed to writing in the first century BCE and those parts that were added later. Because of the desolation of Indian Buddhism first by Turks, later by Hindus and Muslims, we have a much less complete record of the canon as it stood, also hampered by the fact that Tibetan Imperial policy decreed that there was little point in further translating Hinayāna texts beyond those sutras that had been translated already --thus the vast majority of Hinayāna material in Sanskrit that was translated into Tibetan is the Mulasarvastivadin Vinaya. China lucked out inso far as much that was translated into Chinese was translated fifth century and earlier, when India was still largely dominated by Buddhists politically.

For example, the Sarvastivadins considered the Abhidharmapitika was something embedded with the Sutra pitika, being the focus of advanced discussions of the Dharma by the Buddha. In this respect, then, Abhidharma was something to extracted, a basked with a basket, there are other organization schemes as well. It's expression was the treatises attributed to Arhats concerning various topics. In other words, for whatever reason, different sets of vinaya lineages preserved different traditions about the origin, content and authorship of Abhidharma traditions. We have very little evidence apart from similar and dissimilar texts, and we cannot now understand the precise conditions that lead to the various discrepancies we find in origination legends and so on.

People imagine they can nail down Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna too, but this is equally fraught. I have been studying Buddhist texts, both in the western academic tradition for nearly thirty years and as a practitioner of Vajrayāna for 25. I have decided for myself, based on reading many thousands of books and articles that at this point, that the academic tradition in the west about Buddhism (the burgeoning hermeneutic around that so influential on people like daverupa) largely consists of western academics who spout opinions as unfounded certainties, when in fact their work largely consists of conjectural reconstructions which cannot be grounded in anything anyone truly can regard as factual.

If you look at the Pali Nikayas and the Chinese Agamas, the similarities are literally undeniable.

The titles are literally translations of each other.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, of course, but this does not mean that every single text spoken by the Buddha was preserved at the first council.

No, what I mean to tell you is that it is entirely conjectural to imagine that the Sutta Nipatta is "early" and that various suttas in the Digha Nikaya are "late", and so on.

Of course, we one can try to conjecture which suttas were taught early in the Buddha's career, and which were taught later in his life, but this is also a difficult thing. A lot of suttas have no location given, and we only have a general idea of where Buddha went and at what time in his career.

Also a matter to consider is to see how the material in the texts matches up with what we know archaeologically from the period. The Nikayas/Agamas give a clear depiction of what life was like back then. It depicts India as being a collection of various states vying for power with one another,a barter economy, and many other such things. Remember that the Buddha passed into Parinirvana at a transitional time in the history of India when things were undergoing great social change. The fact that the texts aren't filled with anachronistic portrayals of daily life also can be used to establish validity. Just because we don't have absolute certainty about absolutely everything we say doesn't mean that the entire thing is baseless speculation. There is such a thing as reasonable inference.

I gave a carefully presented argument with premises and conclusions as why the Abhidhamma doesn't date back to the time of the Buddha himself, and instead of criticizing the initial premises or finding a flaw in the deduction from them, the response is "Your argument comes from materialism."
The fundamental principle upon which you base your argument is material texts, none of which materially date earlier than the first century BCE, and were all written down at the same time, so you have nothing more and a series of conjectures you have formed which stands in contradiction to the traditionally asserted origin of the texts themselves.

The Theravada tradition puts the Abhidhamma back to the time of the Buddha, but I think the Sarvastivadin tradition says it was composed by latter disciples, not the Buddha himself. If your approach is to simply follow a chronology passed down by tradition the issue becomes "Do we follow the Sarvastivadin account, the Theravada account, the Dharmaguptaka account, etc..."

Malcolm wrote:

The Abhidharma and the Abhidhamma Pitika cannot be equated. They are separate traditions coming from separate schools.

If you are a Theravadin, you follow the Theravadin account of the origin of Abhidhamma, if not then not. It is really quite straight forward and involves no conjecture at all.

You are making a fundamental error that most people grounded in TEXT make, i.e, assuming that we can analyze what were orally transmitted teachings that were organized before they were written down into bodies of knowledge as if they were TEXTS.

Bakmoon said:
First of all, just because something is transmitted orally doesn't mean that it is not a text. It's just an oral text rather than a written text. It's a strange use of terminology for most people, but especially in India which has a long tradition oral memorized transmission they work very much like written texts.

Can you back up your claim that orally transmitted texts cannot be analyzed? The principles of textual analysis are rather basic postulates such as "If two textual transmissions have material in common, it is most likely derived either from a common source" or "If text A is commenting on text B, then B is older and A is younger". Sure, they are used most often in written texts, but can you demonstrate that there is a fundamental difference between oral texts and written texts that renders this inapplicable? You have asserted this claim and done nothing to back it up.

Malcolm wrote:
You are missing my general point, there is really no effective way to layer date oral transmissions. We have an event in Buddhist history (as far as the Pali canon is concerned), i.e. it was committed to writing in the first century BCE. We can speculate many things about the written texts we find there, but it is all speculative conjecture. It is not "history".

Bakmoon said:
The underlined part doesn't make sense to me. It is true that the Vibhanga and its analogues is based on the Suttas taught by the Buddha combined with explanations and definitions, but that just means that the Vibhanga and its analogues is based on what the Buddha said. It doesn't mean that the Vibhanga and its analogues were spoken by the Buddha, much less the entire Abhidhamma pitika.

Malcolm wrote:
Your assumption is based on a materialist approach to text criticism. Other [i.e. traditional] historical approaches fully accept that Buddha taught the Vibhanga and so on in toto.

That's an argument from silence.

No, it is clearly described in the canon that there are three pitikas, not merely two. But according to the modern approach, the third pitika does not exist.

Malcolm wrote:
Let me ask you, do you think Abhidhamma was taught by the Buddha. If not, why?

Bakmoon said:
Do I believe that the Abhidhamma Pitika was spoken by the Buddha? No. The clearest reason for this lies in comparative analysis of the different early canons. There are large differences in content in the canonical Abhidharmic literature of the various early schools. If you look to the portions that actually do match up with one another you find that much of the material in the Vibhanga and its analogues is held in common between the different traditions, and that material is simply a collection of several of the more comprehensive suttas from the Nikayas and Agamas fleshed out with more stock passages, lists of synonyms, and definitions.

As you get further away from this common core material in Abhidharmic literature, the level of textual differences increase between the different versions in different canons. The common sense explanation for this is that the Vibhanga and its analogues are earlier than the other material in the Abhidhamma. And also, if the earliest material is simply a modification of already existing Suttas, it stands to reason that it was composed after these Suttas. From plain common sense, it seems that the Abhidarmic literature developed over time as a systematization and a refinement of earlier material, so no, I don't think it goes back to the Buddha himself.

Malcolm wrote:
You are making a fundamental error that most people grounded in TEXT make, i.e, assuming that we can analyze what were orally transmitted teachings that were organized before they were written down into bodies of knowledge as if they were TEXTS.

The second thing that is telling is that you reject the account of the origin of ABHIDHAMMA because its origin legend (i.e. Buddha taught to the devas and summarized it for Śaruputra) is not shared with Saravastivadins and so on, who have a very different Abhidharma tradition. This rejection is grounded on a tradition of materialist text criticism that originates with Barcuh Spinoza, more or less, which generally rejects all so called "supernatural" accounts.

Moreover, you contradict yourself here:  "if the earliest material is simply a modification of already existing Suttas" and "I don't think it goes back to the Buddha himself".

Even if Abhidhamma is a compendium of passages from sutta,an interpretive scheme, if you hold those suttas were taught by the Buddha, then Abhidhamma goes back to the Buddha. And further, there is no reason to imagine that Buddha did not himself indicate what sort of interpretive scheme should be applied since we have a clear tradition that Buddha taught three pitikas, not merely two.

It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases. Well-planned vegetarian diets are appropriate for individuals during all stages of the life cycle, including pregnancy, lactation, infancy, childhood, and adolescence, and for athletes. A vegetarian diet is defined as one that does not include meat (including fowl) or seafood, or products containing those foods. This article reviews the current data related to key nutrients for vegetarians including protein, n-3 fatty acids, iron, zinc, iodine, calcium, and vitamins D and B-12. A vegetarian diet can meet current recommendations for all of these nutrients. In some cases, supplements or fortified foods can provide useful amounts of important nutrients. An evidence- based review showed that vegetarian diets can be nutritionally adequate in pregnancy and result in positive maternal and infant health outcomes. The results of an evidence-based review showed that a vegetarian diet is associated with a lower risk of death from ischemic heart disease. Vegetarians also appear to have lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, and lower rates of hypertension and type 2 diabetes than nonvegetarians. Furthermore, vegetarians tend to have a lower body mass index and lower overall cancer rates. Features of a vegetarian diet that may reduce risk of chronic disease include lower intakes of saturated fat and cholesterol and higher intakes of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, soy products, fiber, and phytochemicals. The variability of dietary practices among vegetarians makes individual assessment of dietary adequacy essential. In addition to assessing dietary adequacy, food and nutrition professionals can also play key roles in educating vegetarians about sources of specific nutrients, food purchase and preparation, and dietary modifications to meet their needs.

Trungpa used any method he could to reach people who were hard to reach. He also used these to create situations so that people could go beyond their limitations, which after all is the job of a real teacher of Dzogchen and Mahamudra.

For example, sometimes he would randomly have his driver pull into a stranger's driveway, and have the student get out and knock on the door, he did many things like this all the time. He would burst into people's rooms in the middle of the night at his seminaries, and if you were sleeping alone, without a partner, he would demand to know why and then fix you up with someone.

In any case, it hardly matters now what he did. He has passed on, and a teacher like him will not be seen again for a long while.

Wayne Verrill said:
I apologize for the long delay in responding to the last post under this topic, but the matter has just come to my attention.  The actual title of Sonam Tsemo's book appears on Volume 3, page 146, line 3 in the Sa-skya bKa'-'bum edition and on Volume 1, page 574, line 3 of the Lam-'bras Tshogs-bshad edition.  The translation of this section is in the Epilogue on page 531.  The actual Tibetan term is rnal-'byor mig, which literally translates as Yoga Eye.  The fact that this is the title is confirmed by many commentators who refer to the root text by this name.  Since Yoga Eye is a bit awkward in English, I took the liberty of changing it to Yogini's Eye, justified on the basis of the Hevajra Tantra being identified as a Yogini Tantra (see pages 290-297 in the translation).  This issue was actually referred to on page 5 of the Translator's Introduction.     .

Malcolm wrote:
It's "eye of yoga" as the Tibetan bears out, and it is not the common title of the text, rgyud sde spyi rnam is the common title. The full title of course is rgyud sde spyi'i rnam par gzhag pa bzhugs so.

The line in question says "rgyud sde spyi'i rnam par gzhag pa rnal 'byor mig", i.e. " The General Presentation of the Divisions of Tantra is the eye of yoga...", etc.

So I have to disagree with your contention that "Eye of Yoga" is the title in that line, rather, it is a descriptive of what the text is supposed to do, i.e. provide an eye on yoga.

Further, Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen refers to this text simply by the name rgyud sde spyi'i rnam par gzhag pa in the the rgyud sde spyi'i rnam par gzhag pa dang rgyud kyi mngon par rtogs pa'i stong thun sa bcad.

The Hevajra Tantra is not merely an Yogini Tantra, it is also a yogatantra, for this reason Loppon Rinpoche explains that Hevajra is non-dual tantra based on this passage from Vajrapañjara:
The Hevajra yogatantra
was explained by the Victor first.
Later the yoginītantra
similarly is for the conversion of women.
Loppon Rinpoche adds:
True, it may be called “ḍākinītantra”. That does not contradict a nondual method and discriminating wisdom tantra because discriminating wisdom tantra is necessary in nondual tantra.
When Lowo Khenchen [rgyud sde spyi rnam gsal byed sogs, pg. 18], defines the reason for the name rgyud sde spyi'i rnam par gzhag pa, he states, " Loppon Sonam Tsemo's composition has four synonyms: 1) The tantra division 2) the general presentation 3) an introduction to all tantras 4) the eye of yoga."

However, that does not justify "the yogini's eye" as a title. In fact, the formal title given in the colophon is actually, The General Presentation of the Tantra Divisions, an Introduction to all
Tantras.

If you were to retitle the book, The Eye of Yoga would be a better choice, in my opinion.

Rongzompa:

Now then, in the sravaka system, phenomena do not have the nature of a self. Since is also asserted there is no identity existing in any phenomena, all phenomena are established to be empty and without self, but nevertheless since [all phenomena] are asserted as the nature of subject and object, the category “natureless” is not understood.

Since in the yogacāra system the nature of subject and object are not asserted, the natureless is established; at that time there is no difference between naturelessness and emptiness and selflesness. Nevetheless, since they assert the dependent, arising from cause and conditions, the category of “established as non-arising” is not understood.

Since in the madhyamaka system the ultimate is understood as free from proliferation, non-arising is established. At that time there is no difference between non-arising, naturelessness, [67/b] emptiness and selflessness. Nevertheless, since they assert a true relative truth, the category of “established as homogenous” is not understood.

Since in the system of secret mantra asserts the two truths to be inseparable, homogeneity is established. At that time there is no difference between homogeneity, non-arising, naturelessness, emptiness and selflessness. Nevertheless, due to anxiety about not being able to practice uniform behavior and not being able to remove that anxiety quickly, for that purpose they undertake ascetic hardships. Therefore, the category “all phenomena are established to be non-dual” is not understood.

Because the system of dzogchen understands four things for all phenomena— understanding what is to be abandoned; understanding what is to be taken up; understanding what can be left in equanimity; and understanding what can never be actualized, it establishes all phenomena as non-dual. At that time there is no difference between non-duality, homogeneity, [68/a] non-arising, naturelessness, emptiness and selflessness. Since that is so, because this establishment of all phenomena as non-dual is the heart of all intimate instructions, therefore, [dzogchen] is “the heart of all intimate instructions”

In all these arguments people continually forget about the influence of current karma in order to justify the status quo (ie samsara).  karmic outcomes are not fixed, they can be changed, otherwise our view of karma does not differ from the largely fatalistic "Hindu" view.

Malcolm wrote:
It depends on what kind of outcome, i.e., ripened results we are talking about. For example, we cannot fix the outcomes of some dominant results, i.e., being born in a place frequently afflicted by famine. We cannot alter our lifespan, we have limited control over our health (we all age, sicken and die). If we are born with defective sense organs, there is nothing we can do about this. If we are born as an animal, hell being or a preta, there is nothing to be done about it until we have exhausted that karma.

If one is a born as a deva or an asura, there is little motive to practice virtue.

If you are a human being, you can do something about the circumstances of your life, up to a point.

But most humans , ignorant of the force of karma, just continue to spiral into lower realms. So, it may not be the case that karmic outcomes are "fixed", but they might as well be considering the very little that people do to change such results by practicing virtue in this lifetime.

BTW, even hearing the name Bhaisajyaguru Buddha comes about as a result of past karma...

To clarify, the earliest evidence for monasteries we have is late.  Schopen:
The earliest “monasteries” that are known in India – and none of these are pre-Aśokan – are not “monasteries” at all. They are either only barely improved, unorganized, natural caverns or caves, or poorly constructed and ill-organized shelters built of rubble and other cheap materials. Communities living in these environments could not have produced our elaborate vinayas, nor would they have had any use for them. Since such communities had no steam rooms (jentāka), for example, how could they possibly have generated elaborate rules governing their construction and use?
Gregory Schopen, “The Good Monk and His Money in Monasticism of 'the Mahāyāna Period'” in Indian Monastic Buddhism Collected Papers on Textual, Inscriptional and Archaelogical Evidence (New Delhi, India: Motilal Banarsidass Publishers Private Limited), 1-2.

Malcolm wrote:
Again, this is entirely speculative. For example, the Vinaya-kṣudraka-vastu clarifies that jentākas [bsro khang] are to be built by lay people for monks. Jentākas are not hard to construct. They are round. They are built by lay people. They do not need to be permanent structures. They are part of Indian health culture. They are mentioned in Ayurvedic texts such as the Caraka Samhita, the Jivasūtra, and so on. So I put it to you that when he claims the early Sangha had no access to jentākas he is full of it, and is ignoring the evidence in front of his face. A stream bath does not have to be built of marble to be effective.



Indrajala said:
Look, when it is reported in Vinaya that monks can use leather shoes if they travel to the Himalayan regions, we do not need to have a sample of carbon-dated leather shoes found in Magadha or somewhere else to understand that some monks wore leather sandals even during the time of the Buddha.
That's not what scholars are really looking for. They're wondering about the monastic steam rooms and legal financial contracts as outlined in Vinaya literature when there is no evidence monks, in the Buddha's time at least, had such bathing facilities or the Magadha economy was mature and literate enough to merit the use of ecclesiastical financial contracts.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course monks has access to bathing facilities. They bathed, just like other human beings. Honestly, this kind of thing really lacks common sense.

As I'm sure you understand, the concern is really that the literature as we have it seems to reflect a post-Buddha time period, especially with respect to financial transactions, literacy, complex monastic facilities (steam rooms, etc.) and so forth. We might speculate that some of it really goes back to the Buddha's time, but who knows.

Given that we do not really have much archaeological evidence at all from the post-Harrappan, pre-stone working era of Indian civilization [roughly 1500 BCE to around 250 BCE, it is little facile to claim what primitive Viharas were like and what facilities were provided by their lay hosts.

But Schopen's perspective is really nonsensical since there is plenty of evidence in Sutra as well as Vinaya to paint a portrait of what life was like during the time of the Buddha. There simply is no good and valid reason to discount it.

Allow me to give you an example — the first collection of Appalachian old world ballads compiled in the 1920's. It turns out that the orally transmitted Appalachian versions of many ballads are in fact earlier than the versions of the same ballads as recorded by Sir Walter Scott, published in 1803.

Thanks Jeff, I have understood the "evidence" based approaches to Buddhist history for many years. I understand all the arguments and so on.

It is precisely this "contested by some" that reinforces my conviction that Buddhology just a collection of conflicting opinions.

Malcolm wrote:
It's not a problem at all. Further, attempts at forming a chronology for this or that text are completely speculative.

We only know this as a historical fact: some three hundreds years after the Buddha's parinirvana, his teachings were written down. This included both Mahāyāna and Hinayāna scriptures.

The reason they were written down, according to all traditional accounts, is that there was some fear that future generations would be unable to maintain them as oral transmissions and so they were committed to text.

It's entirely natural for narratives to be edited and otherwise subjected to some kind of organization, but that organizational activity tells us almost nothing about the contents of the information being organized or how old it might be.

When it comes to such things as the four or seven Buddhas prior to Śakyamuni, while it is true in the MN of Ñaṇamoli/Bodhi, isisattamassa is read as "best of seers" at M i.386, it cannot be denied that DN 14 presents a coherent account of the seven past Buddhas.

That can be true. However, perhaps what you call "imperfect" may often have less to do with the technical skill of the translator and more to do with their colored interpretation. The only way around it is to learn the source language for oneself. Nonetheless, it is still useful to have other translations and perspectives for comparison.

See - this is what I'm talking about.  These are all primarily English language cultural obsessions.  Even the French and Germans don't have quite the same obsessions.  Even the Dutch present this stuff differently.  They just don't have the same focus (and you would expect the French to come pretty close in fact).   Power structures, resources - you have reduced the sangha to a cargo cult.

It would be one thing if you came from a 2nd or 3rd world culture with definite scarcity  and extreme secularism (Americans born and raised in the US will never see this about themselves although 3rd culture Americans raise these issues almost whenever we meet one another - and America is at the top of the heap of the unfortunate societies burdened by actual economic scarcity and occasional life-threatening uncertainty) but you come from a very mild social democracy where true scarcity hasn't been an issue since the great Tommy Douglas began the transition of Canada to a modern nation.  Perhaps these issues really reflect your intense focus on the common issues discussed in English speaking academia?  This is not a personal attack.  Each of our fundamental orientations need to be examined in the light of Buddhadharma because they are all relative truth at best (until we can transform our minds into true wisdom).

If your religious authority is founded on false premises (like the Vinaya being the historical decrees of the Buddha), and modern scholars have demonstrated such premises to in fact be false, then the academy is ignored at one's own peril.

Malcolm wrote:
It has not been demonstrated by anyone that the pratimokṣa was not actually taught by the Buddha. The most one can say is that various different schools present slightly different versions of it.

What one can say is that specific procedures of ordination were not necessarily established by the Buddha directly since they in fact vary from sect to sect — but this fact does not require modern scholarship to recognize since this has been recognized for a long, long time within the tradition by people well studied in the traditional histories of Buddhist schools.

No he didn't. The only place in sutra where a "third turning" is mentioned is the Samdhinirmocana sūtra, which has no mention of such an unconditioned self — the idea that Buddha taught such a self just Hinduism in drag.

The three turnings of the wheel are also mentioned by Maitreya in the Sūtrālamkara, but he asserts they were all turned at the same time, not on here, then one there, then another one later on.

Though many generations of scholars in Tibet have concluded that the tathagatagarbha sūtras are part of the "third turning" there is certainly no evidence in the Indian canon that this is so at all. There are actually very, very few references to "a third turning".

Some Tibetan lamas like that kind of logic. If you have in mind the teachings on interdependence, this etymological logic makes some sense.

Malcolm wrote:
It is complete nonsense. It cannot be defended in any way. The way most Tibetans etymologize "sangs rgyas" is that "sangs" means to cleanse or purify, additionally "sangs" also means to wake up; and rgyas means "to expand" or "fully". So it means to remove or cleanse afflictions and to expand wisdom, or more simply, "fully awaken".

Budh simply means to awaken; dha means that possessor of that, hence Buddha simply means "the one who has awakened".

In my perception, Yogacara is a psychological view of the teachings of Prajnaparamita, together with the teachings of Maitreya. It is not a contradiction of the teachings of Nagarjuna.
Yogacara is a realist school. Their position forces them to assert that jñāna is real.
The qualities of wisdom are also mere perception. Some people cling to that experience believing they are real, but they are like illusion also.
It has to do with the question of how the dependent nature shifts from being conditioned to being unconditioned [i.e. the absence of the imagined in the dependent is the perfected:see Mahāyānasaṃgraha by Asanga]. In short, there is an unresolved inner contradiction in the way the Yogacara three natures is presented that forces them to be a realist school.
In fact, you misunderstand what I said, let me explain more clearly: I said that the logical method used by Madhyamikas are not ​​compatible with Dzogchen; but depending on how you interpret the different schools, they vision may or may not be compatible with Dzogchen.
It is not the method they are referring to; they are referring the conclusion.
The method of Dzogchen is the direct introduction to mind, one example is how Patrul Rinpoche was introduced by Do Khyentse Yeshe Dorje to the nature of his mind. And it language is similar to Yogacara. In same way, Mahamudra language is similar to Madhyamaka.
Mahāmudra and Dzogchen both make equal use of terminology from Yogacara. Your distinction is dubious at best.

People like to make a big deal out of some superficial "volte faces" I have shared with you all, but in reality the core of what I understand to be unique about Buddhadharma has not changed in 20 years and will not change since it arises out of my experience of the teachings, as an examination of my posts will show.

Mahāparinibbana sutta.

The Buddha repeated this statement many times in earlier sutras.
Right view proceeding from yogi pratyaksha can inform any approach.
How are you defining yogic pratyakṣa?
As I have said repeatedly, Buddhist dharma is more explicit and has more methods than any other system I have seen/practiced. However, not everyone has a karmic connection to it. If we can use the traces of sentient beings to hook them into their own awakening, we should. This is the point of infusing other systems with the energy of practice and realization.

Malcolm wrote:

Does this mean we should stop teaching Yoga Sutras, etc.? No, of course not. But after a certain point it has to become clear to any practitioner where they have confidence and faith. If someone is really a Shaivaite, Vaishnava or even a follower of Franklin Jones, what need would they have to follow Buddhadharma? They've chosen their refuge. It is not our job to change that. But we should not, in a rush to ecumenicism, erase the distinction between Buddhadharma and Sanatanadharma. They do not point to the same reality, they do not have the same assumptions about karma, rebirth and liberation, and so on.

The Dharmapalas can not be made to act on behalf of selfish intentions, but they will respond to someone with pure samaya who has legitimate concerns, even if this practitioner is still a samsaric being (and thus have a mixed motivation). If that was not the case, then only Buddhas would have ben able to invoke them (absurd), and there would have been no point in any dharmapala practices, actually. The motivation of a practitioner on the path is always flawed, since there is still samsaric vision. But the intention to subdue gross violence through wrathful means is a legitimate one in Vajrayana, especially when we are requesting the Dharmapalas for help and not trying to liberate beings ourselves without the proper capacity or qualifications.

Malcolm is right that Dza Rahula should be invoked by all means necessary. As for wrathful yidam practices, these will work only if those doing them are qualified. I have my doubts that requesting a monastery to do that could be effective. At this point in time there are not many such practitioners, H.H. Sakya Trisin is certainly one of them, Chatral Rinpoche most definitely. Making a formal request to Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche about this however is the easiest option, IMHO, although I am pretty sure that he is already doing something about it. A real master performing Kilaya lower activity or something similar can do more than a thousand monastics mumbling mantras and waiting for the tea break.

My personal opinion is that ISIS is a very valid threat to the Dharma, in every possible sense. However this should not be an "us vs. them" situation, although I admit that it can very easily become just that. That's why there is a lot of merit in Greg's posts too.

In my perception, Yogacara is a psychological view of the teachings of Prajnaparamita, together with the teachings of Maitreya. It is not a contradiction of the teachings of Nagarjuna.

Malcolm wrote:
You are not really understanding what it is about "Prasanga" that Longchenpa, for example, claims to be consistent with Dzogchen. It is not that the means of analysis that is the same, it is the conclusion, i.e., freedom from extremes.


Vajrasvapna said:
Some writers, like Namkhai Norbu, say Manjusrimitra was a scholar of Yogacara and so he used the terminology of this school to explain Dzogchen. I found no Manjusrimitra's biography, except this one:http://www.dharmafellowship.org/biographies/historicalsaints/manjusrimitra.htm. It says he was not a scholar of Yogacara, but an anti-Yogacara: "The Mahapandit Manjusrimitra represented the classical, scholastic tradition of Madhyamaka. He was the uncontested head of the great monastic University of Nalanda, and thus representative of a long historical scholarly line that considered itself the pinnacle of orthodoxy. He viewed anything to do with Yogacara as a false doctrine". If true, then it makes nosense to say that he was just using the term from a school that he advocated earlier.

Transmission may be necessary, but the cult of the guru is sorely mistaken in assuming that their preferred methodology is the only viable mode of transmission for attaining the Way, or Great Perfection.


Malcolm wrote:
The Dzogchen tradition itself asserts a Guru is necessary:
The virtuous mentor is like a precious jewel which produces everything.
— Soaring Great Garuda
Without an authentic master, like the scripture of a monkey, 
the basis and path will be erroneous, indeed one will be seized by conceptuality. 

Therefore, like applying ferrous sulfate to gold, the precious master
should be paid with a gem of inestimable value.
— The Inner Potentiality

The commentary to this runs:
For example, like applying ferrous sulfate to gold, a guru obtains the empowerment and agamas of the authentic lineage. The guru moistened by the experience of realization and who is diligent in the meaning possesses the qualities that are praised in in the collections of the teachings. If one should meet a guru who is devoted to compassion and is diligent with teaching, he should be seen as teacher who is a great treasure. Make a request that corresponds with the collection of the teachings and please him with a positive attitude. Request the teachings, and thoroughly ascertain the view. One must understand the deviations and obscurations from beginning to end, and one must comprehend what is the point of the meaning.
It is thus axiomatic that in order to practice Dzogchen, one must find a qualified guru and follow that person until one has realized the goals of the path. There is really nothing to discuss with regard to this. People who express opinions contrary to what is stated in the tantras and agamas of Dzogchen about the absolute necessity of following a qualified master are merely expressing their ignorance. By persisting in such opinions, they merely widen the gulf between themselves and the possibility of finding such a qualified master.

This kind of non-conceptual samadhi, the samadhi of cessation merely creates causes for rebirth in this or that loka, like all mundane samadhis and dhyanas unless one has attained the path of seeing.

I think one needs to receive the Mahavakyas from a lineage teacher and practice them to realization before one can comment on their topography relative to Buddhist dharma. I don't think that treating advaita strictly as an intellectual position is of much use.

No, but the realms of the non-physical are chock full of bad entities that delight in impersonating Sages and great Gurus.  An 'ordinary' human guru has a lineage and disciples that can attest to his qualifications, in addition to your own impressions.  The non-physical 'guide' has only your unenlightened self and the assertions from it to help you appraise him.

Dzogchen is something very specific and very precise and the instructions to realize its path is not found in other schools. It is not a question of whether the Buddhahood in Dzogchen is the same or different than Buddhahood realized in sutra or tantra, it isn't. But the path is quite different.

It is not really possible to explore this in a simple post.

In lower schools, things like the three kāyas and so on are exteriorized, but in the highest tantric systems they are understood to be implicit in the very structure of the body itself. The way the body is understood in Hindu systems is really not the same, so no, I do not think one can say that aspects of yoga as understood by Hindus were adopted by Buddhists.

So let me get this straight -  a Buddhist who is inspired by stories about Jesus's life and some teachings which help him cultivate kindness, forbearance and compassion, is wasting his time and getting further away from liberation?

I see plenty of potential for people to be inspired by all sorts of stories, teachings, day-to-day occurrences. There is Dharma in all sorts of places if one knows how to see.

Malcolm wrote:
Dan, what is the topic of the thread? "Mixing Buddhist and non-Buddhist Practices", right?

So, essentially, we are not talking about whether Jesus is an inspiring character for someone, our warm feelings about St,. Francis of Assisi and so on.

We are talking about a technical issues, e.g, for example, whether one ought to sincerely attend a Catholic Mass, looking for redemption, as a Buddhist. In other words, we are discussing the appropriateness of someone who claims to follow Buddhadharma who also asserts that Jesus Christ is their lord and savior.

Someone who has taken refuge in the Three Jewels cannot at the same time take Jesus Christ as their lord and savior. They may imagine that they can, but all they succeed in doing is ignorantly destroying their refuge in the Three Jewels.

This is also the case with teachings such as emptiness and dependent origination. For example, I heard HH Dalai Lama, that bastion of ecumenicalism, state in 2005 in Tucson, AZ, that emptiness was not the business of Christians and that he generally felt that Christians ought to mind their own business. Emptiness, he said, was the business of followers of Buddhadharma, and that is was inappropriate for Christians to be interested in it. Why? Because Christians believe in ex nihilo creation, souls, and so on. Ex nihilo creation and dependent origination are mutually incompatible. One does not need to be a Buddhist to see this, as Lucretius said, ex nihilo nihil fit, "nothing comes from nothing" (but we leave all similarity with epicurean materialism here).

It's a little different with Hinduism and Buddhadharma. There are many mundane rites Buddhists can avail themselves of from Hinduism, and have done so for millennia. Even so, it is inappropriate for those who have taken refuge in the Three Jewels to take refuge in Brahma, Shiva or Vishnu and so on because the latter are mundane gods who have not realized the nature of reality and are themselves trapped in samsara, like Jesus, Allah, Jehovah, etc.

We cannot allow our warm and fuzzy feelings obscure the fact that Buddhadharma is something very precise and specific. It is not a method of "becoming a better person", nor is it a method of "resolving our unresolved issues", nor is it a practice of "mindfulness", nor is it a method of "becoming more compassionate", and so on. All of these things reduce Buddhadharma to the level of pop self-help manuals.

If someone from outside the Dharma wants to enter the Dharma he or she must leave their previous refuge behind. You cannot have two feet in two boats (try it, it is really, really difficult), you cannot serve two masters, etc.

Malcolm,

It has validity because in practice many of us are contaminated by spiritual materialism, lack of patience and perseverance. It is a false dichotomy because it doesn't always apply.

As for worldly dharmas, have you transcended worldly Dharmas, Malcolm? Are you sorted, free of neuroses, joyful, resourceful, disciplined, reliable, kind and forgiving, humble, hard-working and undemanding? These are just a few qualities I've observed in some followers of other religions that I could do well to improve in.

Of course we have the Paramitas and wonderful teachings on them. But for some people other teachings may actually resonate better, work better, because of their karma, their strong affinity with another wisdom tradition. I don't think you or I can honestly say that this is wrong, that this cannot be productive and conducive to liberation.

Malcolm wrote:
"Are you sorted, free of neuroses, joyful, resourceful, disciplined, reliable, kind and forgiving, humble, hard-working and undemanding."

Yes, for the most part. Though like any ordinary person I have my strongly afflicted moments.

Those "some people" are not followers of Buddhadharma. They follow other paths.

I can say that other paths are not conducive to the "liberation" we practitioners of Buddhadharma hold to be liberation since this liberation is very clearly defined by the Buddha. Liberation or freedom means being free from afflictive emotions which cause rebirth in samsara. That freedom cannot arise through other paths which encourage a view of soul or a self, or through philosophies which negate the truth of rebirth and karma.

It is true that people have their karmic propensities and are more attracted to this or that religion — it is not our job to interfere with their lives; but the sorrow of samsara is that sentient beings are confused about what will bring them ultimate happiness.

I would suggest strongly that anyone who feels that liberation, as defined in Buddhadharma, can be attained by any other means than realizing the nature of dependent origination and emptiness has not really understood the meaning of the Buddha's teachings on any level.

In other words Dan, other "wisdom" traditions are mundane paths that are not conducive to liberation. They are paths of samsara.

At the end of the day, whatever inspires us and guides us to relinquish all that is unwholesome and to cultivate all that is wholesome, to grow in clarity and wisdom is Dharma, regardless what label it comes with.

Malcolm wrote:
Some Dharma is the Dharma of gods and humans, it isn't liberating, but it certainly can cause people to take higher rebirth in samsara because in general it encourages people to avoid the ten non-virtues.

Unfortunately, non-Buddhist Dharmas (and here we really are only talking about religions in which rebirth is accepted) also are contaminated with incorrect views, so whatever wisdom they lead to will only be mundane and contaminated. As the Buddha pointed out, there is no liberation outside of his Dharma and Vinaya. Someone might point out that there so called independent Buddhas (pratyekabuddhas) but it is held that they do not teach, remaining silent about their realization, hence the Buddha's statement, repeated by him in many sūtras through out his life remains true.

In terms of mixing practices, there is not much point. Someone might respond that Tibetan Buddhism is a mixture of Buddhism and Bon, but this is really a huge overstatement, while it is true that Buddhists adapted some worldly rituals into a Buddhist framwork, such as smoke offerings, and various mundane rites to appease spirits and so on, by no means do they form an essential core of Tibetan Buddhism, since they are palliative rites designed to relieve temporary problems. Buddhism has never had a problem with people continuing to use such practices within the framework of Dharma — we can see this when Buddha instructs Ānanda to rely on brahmins to conduct the Buddha's funerary rites. However, just as you cannot be a citizen of two countries, you cannot have two refuges. One cannot, for example, take refuge in Buddha and Jesus. In other words, there is no reason for a Buddhist who is a former Catholic to take communion since a Buddhist understands that a) there is no such thing as original sin and b) that sins in general cannot be eliminated by washing with water, eating a wafer, etc.

*appeal to science and/or clinical psychology

Ok, you are shifting the argument, Malcolm. So you accept that Islam has made fundamental contributions including algebra? Yes, the Jains had mathematics but the Islamic mathematicians didn't 'steal' Jain work, but developed and advanced their own.

Malcolm wrote:
But they did so on the basis of the numerical system, etc., developed in India. So called "arabic numerals" come from India. Further, most of the contributions of Islamic culture, apart from their own poetry, music and so on, lay in the area of transmitting the knowledge of the Hellenistic world to Europe. Even the Islamic system of medicine is called Unani, which is a corruption of Yavana, i.e. Ionian — Greek.

Dan74 said:
As for killing the apostate, it was a rule much more honoured in the breach, if you check Islamic jurisprudence. Medieval Islamic literature and poetry was indeed much more rich and free than its European counterpart perhaps because apostasy and heresy laws were not applied anywhere near as zealously as the Church and its Inquisition applied theirs.

Malcolm wrote:
That really depends on where you were in the Islamic hegemony, and at what period of history. Georges Bataille has a good analysis of the economic biases that drove the Islamic expansion. In fact they are very nearly the same biases which drove the spread of Christianity and later, corporate capitalism. And your assertion is fallacious — the Zoroastrians were driven from Persia where they were not slain:

Dan74 said:
Until the Jihad, in the mid 7th century Persia (modern-day Iran) was a politically independent state, spanning from the Aegean Sea to the Indus River[3] and dominated by a Zoroastrian majority.

People should remember the vanished Zoroastrian civilization of Persia before claiming that Islam "treated" non-Muslims better than Christians treated pagans.

In fact, all three Abrahamic religions are fundamentally pernicious which is why the site of their origin is such a total mess and has been for millennia, ever since one band, the Hebrews exterminated another band, the Canaanites.

As far as I am concerned, if Islam and its "contributions" were lost to history like the Zoroastrians, it would be no great loss for humanity.

Good morning everyone! Had a quick question:

I'm taking a break from reading up on teachings and am exploring the history of different Buddhist traditions. Each tradition is equally beautiful in its own accord and completely fascinating to me. I've been practicing now for over 10 years and it's been nice just objectively reading about each form and tradition. But I've come to the Tibetan form to ask this specific question because I know someone will know the answer.

I've discovered that the first appearance of Avalokiteśvara is in the Lotus Sutra. I questioned this, and did some digging and haven't found otherwise. I assumed the Lotus Sutra was written way after the Tibetan tradition, but this isn't the case. Supposedly the sutra was finished by 200 AD. How did this sutra not make it into TIbetan Buddhism? Is it studied at all within the tradition? You'll have to explain this to me like I'm 5 years old because I really am ignorant of most of Buddhist history, outside of the story of Shakyamuni.

Thanks!

“Tibetan Buddhism designed by the CCP”
By Woeser

Not long ago, several important incidents took place in succession: 1) Because of a minor explosion at the end of October 2011, of the originally over 300 monks only 6 are now left in Karma Monastery in Chamdo County, Kham, TAR. 2) At the end of 2012, Drongna Monastery in Driru County, Nagchu Prefecture, TAR was closed down, all monk residences were sealed and many monks arrested; subsequently, the Tarmoe and Rabten monasteries of Driru County were also closed down. 3) In December 2013, an official government notice was issued to the famous Labrang Monastery in Sangchu County, Gannan Autonomous Prefecture, Gansu Province, requesting to expel all non-local monks studying at the monastery within a three months period.

At the end of 2008, I wrote several essays: “‘Patriotic Education’ in Tibet”, “Another Cultural Revolution is Quietly Sweeping across Tibet’s Monasteries”, “Behind the Curtain of ‘Legal Education’”, “The Intentions Behind Transforming Monasteries into Tourist Attractions”, “The ‘Clean Up’ of Lhasa that is Hidden from the Outside World”. It is evident that the encircling and annihilation of Tibet’s monasteries is continuously moving forward, becoming more and more far-reaching. Just as I wrote at the end of 2008, “the local Party authorities are currently launching the cruelest and most bitter clean up of Tibetan monasteries since the Cultural Revolution. In the Chinese media, none of these “black box operations” are ever mentioned. Another Cultural Revolution is currently sweeping across Tibet. In 1966, Buddhist temples and statues were smashed and monks and nuns expelled, leaving behind a forlorn field of ruins. Now this second Cultural Revolution will completely eradicate any genuine monks and nuns, leaving behind nothing but the shell of monasteries and monks and nuns who are bound to lose their courage and conscience.”

If we have not already forgotten, we must remember how on October 4, 2008, the three main monasteries in Lhasa – Drepung monastery, Sera monastery and Ganden monastery – were attacked by military police in the middle of the night, monks – almost entirely students of Buddhism coming from Gansu, Qinghai, Sichuan, or Yunnan provinces (officially called “the four Tibetan provinces”) – were arrested at their residences. They were sent to Gormo military prison and repatriated to their hometowns after the Beijing Olympics; none of them were allowed to ever return to the monasteries.

It has always been true that more than half of the monks in Lhasa’s three main monasteries were not locals. This is a 500-year-old tradition, existing ever since the establishment of these three main monasteries, and it is the tradition of 2000 years of Buddhism. This, indeed, also includes monasteries of Chinese Buddhism that have always been inhabited by monks from all across the country. Today, Chinese monasteries have remained the same, monks from different counties and provinces reside there to study, but the monks of Lhasa’s three main monasteries have been expelled and imprisoned by military force. This has hardly ever happened in the history of Tibetan Buddhism, it only started occurring frequently in modern times under the rule of the CCP.

If we have not already forgotten, we must remember the official Tibetan document that appeared on the website of the local authorities at the end of 2008; it was a decision issued by the head of the Kardze Autonomous Prefecture targeting all 18 counties of Kardze Prefecture, stating that the local authorities will carry out the following steps against 10-30% of the monasteries whose nuns and monks participated in the protests: any religious events will be forbidden, the movement and actions of nuns and monks will be strictly controlled; all nuns and monks inside monasteries must once again “officially enrol”, all monks and nuns who do not pass the “patriotic education” examination will be expelled, all monks residences will be demolished. As for those who participated in the protests, in minor cases they will be sent back to their hometowns, in severe cases they will be imprisoned.

Starting from 2011, work groups have been stationed inside over 1700 monasteries in the TAR, employing over 7000 members of staff. Altogether, the official number of registered monks and nuns is 46,000; does this mean that each official stationed in a monastery is responsible for 6-7 monks? The problem is that in Karma Monastery, the birthplace of the Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism, for example, officials currently outnumber monks. So does this mean that the goal of this movement, launched by Chen Quanguo and now already experiencing the third change of shifts, is to step-by-step decrease the amount of monks and eventually close down all monasteries?

Meanwhile, the authorities of “the four Tibetan provinces” are equally encircling and attacking the over 150,000 monks and their monasteries. It is impossible that all these local cadres are simply imitating what officials in the TAR do; no, these are clearly the hard-liner policies coming from the highest level. In fact, it is the continuation and implementation of Mao Zedong’s “Tibet Policies”. Mao once said: “We must also reform all monasteries. After successful reform, there will be a time when the number of lamas is greatly reduced… how should we reform monasteries, you should think of a solution.” (May 7, 1959, Guidelines After Putting Down Tibet’s Revolt). This so-called solution seems to be the model that we can observe in today’s Karma and Drongna monasteries and also in Lhasa’s three main monasteries, it is a model of Tibetan Buddhism designed by the CCP.

Perhaps there's other meanings to this also. It's not uncommon for tantric rules and teachings to have multiple levels of meaning.
Personally I see the empowerment lama, the teaching, the deity, the Buddha, the vows, the views, the effort I make, etc. all being aspects of the same karmas or on a deeper level the potential of all beings to become a Buddha.  I like my current view of things because it allows me to retain my independent thinking so if it turns out I joined a bad cult I can back out without feeling I've broken my relationship to the Triple Gem.

As far as I know, I have received no HYT empowerments (two Chenrezig initiations), and yet at least one of my practices has guru yoga as preliminary practice as part of the sadhana..additionally, unless i'm mistaken in what I was told, guru yoga is supposed to be a part of  deity sadhana practice period it was there in the initiations themselves...unless I'm not understanding what "guru yoga" actually is, but I think I am. If this is inappropriate to answer publicly, no problem.

Malcolm wrote:
If you are practicing Avalokiteśvara and Mahāmudra indeed, the sadhana has a kind of guru yoga worked in it. If you are practicing Tsembupa Avaokiteśvara, this is actually an HYT practice and presumes that prior to receiving the instruction you have received both a major empowerment of some kind as well as at least a jenang into Avalokiteśvara. The King's tradition Avalokieśvara major empowerment is often used by HH Sakya Trizen for giving this instruction.

I never said one could not do this. I wouldn't bother since there is no need to add anything to our lineage. If someone wants to be celibate, they can simply take the full upāsaka ordination with the intention to follow brahmacarya. If they wish to wear robes or follow the vows of a dge tshul, they may. If they later change their minds about being celibate, they also may, without needing to change anything. If you become a dge tshul however, it is a different matter, and deciding to become non-celibate requires relinquishing one's status as part of the ordained sangha.

It can't. We do not have that ordination. We cannot rewrite Vinaya to include it.

There are basically eight kinds of ordained people in Mulasarvastivada: lay men and women, lay fast day participants (male and female), male and female novices, and male and female fully ordained persons. However, since there was never any fully ordained bhikṣunis to ordain women with the special probationary vows in Tibet, the Mulasarvastivadin bhikṣuni ordination was never introduced to Tibet and this is why there are no fully ordained Mulasarvastivadin bhikṣunis today, nor has there been any for a thousand years.

Of course, if someone wishes to take the Gomin ordination in Theravada, there is nothing to stop them. But they cannot receive it in Tibetan Buddhism, they must go to Theravada.

Title: Re: Mind, Clear Light and the Five Aggregates

whitetiger said:
Greetings,

I hope I"m posting this question to the proper forum.  I have a question about what's often translated as "Clear Light," "Radiant Light" or "Inner Radiance" in Tibetan Buddhism, particularly in the Bardo Thodol.  The Clear Light is the subtlest level of mind and purest awareness, and the "meeting of mother and child lights" results in Buddhahood.  Correct?  But is the Clear Light distinct from and beyond the five aggregates, or is it part of them?  If it's distinct from the five aggregates, does this mean it never incarnates and only new aggregates are born in each life (with the Clear Light untouched by any of it)?  If that is the case, does that explain why the idea of "reincarnation" (as in, same self born again and again) is a fallacy and yet there is a pure awareness that is nevertheless present?

Finally, is the Clear Light the same as "universal mind" which is indivisible and one with all (i.e. no "your clear light," "my clear light," etc. I know it's crude but I don't know how else to put it)?  Does it appear to be divided only when obscured by or tied to an individual consciousness (e.g. an individual person, a Bodhisattva, immortal, god, Buddha, etc.)?

Hope someone can help me understand.

First of all, you must understand that all four schools, Sakya, Kagyu, Nyingma and Gelug treat the notion of "clear light" rather differently.

So for example, Atiśa was an avid enthusiast of Candrakīrti, and within 70 years of Atisha's death in 1052, everything that was attributed to Candrakirti, whether sūtra or tantra, was translated into Tibetan.

As to your question, since the six perfections included pretty much everything meaningful there is to practice and cultivate as a Dharma person, yes.

Your statement presumes there is some objective external historical reality out there waiting to be verified by scholars.

You mean the sūtras, śastras and Dharma histories are not sufficient evidence of this?

Can we believe that these dynasties with their legendary riches, and the remarkable intellectual and cultural life of India in the time of the Buddha and Mahâvîra, existed in a totally illiterate sphere?

...Even given the very different cultural role of writing in India as compared to many other ancient civilizations, it is hard to conceive that practical affairs such as the keeping of records and accounts in a fabulously wealthy empire like that of the Nandas could have been kept in order without any form of writing at all, or at least without some alternative system of memory-aids like the Inca quipu . Thus one is tempted to think along the lines of William Bright (cited by Falk, p.290) of some type of writing that was "perhaps used for commercial purposes, but not for religious or legal texts."

As I understand, he is saying that in Cittamatra, the dharmadhatu of the meditator's own continuums, i.e., the pole of experience that is luminous and aware, is taken as a the support for meditation (dmigs rten), so whan that continuum is severed, as in the case of nirvana without remainder, there is no more gotra. But bodhisattvas never sever their continuums; they transform (or gradually reveal) the gotra as the dharmakaya.

In Madhyamaka, on the other hand, it is asserted that an arhat's contimuum at the time of nirvana without remainder is not severed. Although the delusional obscurations (nyon bsgrib) have been eliminated, some (or all) knowledge obscurations remain embedded in the alaya.

Reasonable interpretation? Or am I all screwed up?

I guess it makes sense, given that the natural gotra is held to be the special feature of the six ayatanas. If there are no more ayatanas, then there can no longer be a natural gotra.

Am I right in thinking that only False Aspectarian Cittamatrins assert that all beings possess buddha-essence, which is the truly existent natural purity of the mind?
If so, what do True Aspectarians assert is the buddha-essence? Obviously (?) it cannot be something that is possessed by all beings.

Thanks, Malcolm, for your input.

I think it is better to put it in terms of classical Yogacara. For example, Dharmamitra states in his Prasphuṭapadā commentary on the Abhisamayālaṃkara:
This one the Mahāyāna Madhyamikas describes as difficult to have realization, but the Yogacarin assertion that the icchanthika (rigs chad pa) 'burns the seed' slanders tathagātagarbha.
If you run a search on the term rigs med pa, rather than rigs chad pa, you will find very ample discussion of the concept in the Yogacarin section on the Tengyur.

For example, Municandra's Sūtrālaṁkāravṛttibhāṣya states:

If one lacking gotra generates [bodhi]citta, the seed will not "take".


But it is important to keep in mind that the concept of agotra and icchantika comes from the Tathagatagarbha and Yogacarin stream of sutra, specifically the Lanka and the Nirvana. They are a little different from each other. But they are both rejected by Madhyamaka.

Schopen, and Jeff, make one of the most basic faults described in archaeology — to whit — pots are not people. Moreover, in a climate like India's, wood structures do not survive much less kutis. The whole argument that there was no organized monastic Sangha prior to Ashoka must be laughed at, since we clearly have evidence in the Vinaya.

For example, as to the charge of anachronism, let it be pointed out that the Illiad contains many, many anachronisms. Nevertheless, it also contains a record of a war that was actually fought in the place where the text says the war at Troy was fought.

It is well known everywhere, and in all traditions, that Buddha's teachings were not written down until a very late date.

You are suggesting for example, by invoking scientists like Stevenson and Sheldrake that "Science" is the arbiter of truth for Buddhists.

This, in my opinion, is the wrong way to go about it.

For example, one might conclude from archaeology that Indians had no temples prior to meeting the Greeks. But in fact we know that they did because 1) such structures get mentioned 2) when Indians first tried to work stone ( perhaps under Greek influence) with engineering principles based on wood construction, with obvious limitations on heights and sizes of structures. But this shows of course that Indians were quite used to building large wooden structures.

As for Schopen's contention that monastic communities are all post-Ashoka, he hasn't a shred of proof for this. We know that by the time of Ashoka there were so many people representing themselves as Buddhist monks that he felt compelled to disrobe many many thousands of mendicants. Moving camps do not leave much trace. It is like asserting that there are no communities on the high plains of Tibet because the nomads there live in tents. But in fact there is a sophisticated culture there, complete with economic standards, trade, large mobile monasteries and so on.

There is no reason to assume that Ananda, for example, never experienced frostbite in the Himalayas and that this story is necessarily a fabrication. The world was colder then. India was cooler and wetter at that time than it is now, especially after five centuries of increasing deforestation.

I don't think you are a heretic, but I don't think there is any wisdom or truth in your quest for secular "historical" knowledge.

I think that the scholars like Schopen could really care less if Dharma survives as a living tradition or not. In my view, this negates the value of their contributions completely.

You really do need to read Spinoza's Tractatus. In it you will find the root of your present enterprise, and you will understand it has nothing to with the survival of Dharma.

Historical is in written with the intention of constituting accounts of events that actually took place.

My view of history is likewise secular, simply because the evidence based approach works best in the study of history. It doesn't explain everything, but produces a solid working model upon which you can build on. Mystical experiences and magic, which I don't actually deny, are difficult to fit into an evidence based approach to history as they're too subjective.

Malcolm wrote:
One has to understand that Dharma history and secular history do not have the same aims. The point of the latter to explain the sources of living lineages; the point of the latter is strictly forensic analysis, like examining a corpse.

They are indeed historical documents. For example, you can read many conflicting accounts of the Second World War, does this mean that those documents are not "historical"?

If you wish to be a disciple of Spinoza, that is fine with me, but it is not Buddhadharma.

In other words, Sujato's point, one I fully agree with, is that it is hasty to make assumptions about a body of literature one has not thoroughly examined.

Indrajala said:
You can extract what you need from it to prove your point: like the development of banking protocols by the sangha administration, etc.

If you're going to attack Schopen, actually cite his work and something you disagree with.

Malcolm wrote:
As to your first point — like economics, much of what passes for fact in the Academy follows from the kinds of assumptions one makes. In the case of Shopen, his assumptions largely stem from a materialist view of history.

There is no need — qualms about Shopen's approach to Buddhist history have frequently been voiced by his colleagues in the Academy, largely due to his limiting insistence that everything must be tied to some archaeological find.

I don't have Schopen's work as I left it behind due to flight weight but if I did I'd check the Bibliography and body of work to see if he quotes Kunkyen Tsonawa's Vinaya commentary "Rays of the Sun".

Indrajala said:
Schopen's point is to reconstruct the chronological development of Vinaya literature in India, not propound the practical and useful qualities of the monastic system as understood by Tibetans.

Do you realize how enormous the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya literature is?

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, I look at it frequently in my job a as scholar and translator of Tibetan texts. It is very difficult and has lots of obscure terms.

In other words, Sujato's point, one I fully agree with, is that it is hasty to make assumptions about a body of literature one has not thoroughly examined.
