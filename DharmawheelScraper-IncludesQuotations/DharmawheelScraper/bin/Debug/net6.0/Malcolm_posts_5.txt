A couple of quick notes:

Astus, My point about the links prior to ‘birth’ is that, as you noted, they can’t be changed. Since ‘ignorance’ (and all the links to ‘becoming’) are prior to ‘birth', nothing can be done to prevent birth.
Regarding labels, I agree, but then all dharmas, including the Twelve Links and the Dharma, are labels. EOD.

Malcolm, If “bhāva = karma”, then why would the Buddha have said bhava instead of karma? Or used them interchangeably in other suttas?

And how would you explain it without words?


P.S: The Vibhanga is no help. It’s more words and mostly the same explanations which really don’t explain.

For example, now “becoming” is “action-becoming” and “resultant-becoming”, and some how (whatever “becoming” means) this gives rise to birth (of a being which ages and dies).

Malcolm wrote:
The term  bhava means "to come into existence," in this case, craving and attachment lead to existence.

For example, in the Nidana sutta it says:

" 'From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. If there were no becoming at all, in any way, of anything anywhere — i.e., sensual becoming, form becoming, or formless becoming — in the utter absence of becoming, from the cessation of becoming, would birth be discerned?"

"No, lord."

"Thus this is a cause, this is a reason, this is an origination, this is a requisite condition for birth, i.e., becoming.

Becoming
"'From clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming.' Thus it has been said. And this is the way to understand how from clinging as a requisite condition comes becoming. If there were no clinging at all, in any way, of anything anywhere — i.e., clinging to sensuality, clinging to precepts and practices, clinging to views, or clinging to doctrines of the self — in the utter absence of clinging, from the cessation of clinging, would becoming be discerned?"

I’m back to asking what is the meaning of “becoming”? And how is it a requisite condition of birth (of a being which ages and dies)?

And in reading the Maha-nidana Sutta ( https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.15.0.than.html ) there’s this: "If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for name-and-form?' one should answer, 'There is.’

"If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does name-and-form come?' one should say, 'Name-and-form comes from consciousness as its requisite condition.’

"If one is asked, 'Is there a demonstrable requisite condition for consciousness?' one should answer, 'There is.’

"If one is asked, 'From what requisite condition does consciousness come?' one should say, 'Consciousness comes from name-and-form as its requisite condition.'
Huh?! It seems each is dependent on the other as a requisite condition. How does that work? According to the sutta, it seems to depend on consciousness “descending into the womb,” but then consciousness requires “a foothold in name-and-form”.

As he was sitting there he said to the Blessed One: "It's amazing, lord, it's astounding, how deep this dependent co-arising is, and how deep its appearance, and yet to me it seems as clear as clear can be."

[The Buddha:] "Don't say that, Ananda. Don't say that. Deep is this dependent co-arising, and deep its appearance. It's because of not understanding and not penetrating this Dhamma that this generation is like a tangled skein, a knotted ball of string, like matted rushes and reeds, and does not go beyond transmigration, beyond the planes of deprivation, woe, and bad destinations.

I was always taught that Rigpa is knowing the basis, ones natural state.  The basis of course the underlying natural condition as described in things such as Samantabhadras prayer and elsewhere. So when Berzin uses "Basis Rigpa" and says "the working basis we all have" and then ".....normally do not recognize it." Then what does not recognizing it have to do with rigpa?

This is Rangjung Yeshes definition of Basis Rigpa - གཞིའི་རིག་པ་: The fundamental awareness.

Maybe Berzins backgound gets in the way?

Malcolm wrote:
(1)The conscious aspect of the basis does not recognize or not recognize it’s own state, hence it is prior to buddhahood or sentient beinghood— this is called “ignorance identical with the cause.”

(2) When the basis first appears there is a moment of duality, this is called “the connate ignorance.”Liberation and delusion are only possible when the basis appears (gzhi snang) from the basis. Because there is a distinction between the basis and the conscious (shes pa) aspect of the basis, liberation or delusion is possible. The conscious aspect either recognizes the appearance of the basis as its own state and becomes wisdom (shes rab) and is liberated as “Samantabhadra” or (3) it does not recognize the appearance of the basis and enters delusion as a sentient being because of the imputing ignorance.

To understand this precisely one needs to understand the triune pristine consciousness of the basis as well as the triune ignorance which can obscure the conscious aspect of basis. This is all explained pretty clearly in Buddhahood in This Life in topic 1 and 2. I detail the precise progression of the usage of terms in the text, which begins with defining one’s unmodified consciousness as the basis. The distinction between the basis and its conscious aspect may be found briefly described on pp 94-95 of Tantra Without Syllables.

In the now locked thread, Malcolm mentioned that rigpa is actually subcategorized by trekcho and thogal and that the inseparability of kadak and lhundrub actually corresponds to thogal.

What does trekcho correspond to in this case? It's interesting since trekcho instructions also contain numerous introductions to this inseparability and sustaining of its recognition via the Four Chogzhags or the Nine sets of Three relaxations so it seemed like both had the same rigpa and result.

Kadag and lhundrup are inseparable in both cases. The distinction is whether one is resting for a moment directly in the radiance (mdangs) of rigpa in the context of impure appearances without the famous postures and gazes or pure appearances with them.

The four chogzhags are practiced in both. Simply put, the distinction between the two is impure or pure appearances as the path, leading to slightly different results (dematerialization or great transference).

This idea of “cutting solidity” etc., is how some people explain this term. However, there is an alternate explanation from ChNN, which can also be found in various cycles.

The word “khregs” means “bundle,” “chod” is an intransitive verb which means here unravel or undone—the image Padmasambhava uses is a sheaf of wheat that has fallen apart of its own accord. There is no one to cut anything since the verb is intransitive, meaning the verb has no direct object, thus there is no cutting. ChNN generally translated the meaning of this as “releasing  tension,” in other words, to cease grasping thoughts and concepts as they arise.

.....The Atiyoga teachings came after Mahßyoga and are arguably influenced by Chinese thought. In seeking to promote their new philosophy, the
proponents of Atiyoga developed stories demonstrating its superiority. One way to do thiswas to adopt the existing hagiographies of saints so that they came to glorify Atiyoga.....
...The reason the two Vimalamitras were conflated, or that one aspect of his story was a fictional interpolation, is again the issue of authenticity. After the debate at Samyé, India became for many adherents of the New Schools the only valid source for Buddhist teachings,and after the advent of the New Schools, the earliest Indian figures became the most authoritative sources of knowledge. A teaching which had connections with China and
appeared at the end of Relpachen’s reign would have met with resistance on both fronts. However, such doubts were resolved by conflating the two Vimalamitras and thereby connecting the Innermost Spirituality teachings with the original Vimalamitra, who certainly came from India....
I found them highly questionable as he didn't demonstrate in details how Atiyoga are influenced by Chinese thoughts from Taoism.

And he didn't demonstrate how Sri Singha was living in "China" at that time. In fact, quite a number of scholars thought that Sri Singha was more of a central Asian than Chinese.

The above two key points is his main reasoning behind the theory of two Vimalamitra.

I provided two TUR quotes to the contrary, which definitely accord with my understanding.

The other issue which has come up is the meaning of “self liberation” which IME is not particularly related to lack of or liberation of  a conventional ‘self’ in the Sravakayana or Mahayana sense sense, but more refers to the fact that in the Dzogchen view all phenomena of samsara and nirvana are primordially  liberated, so practice does not require any sort of effortful contrivance to liberate them in the first place, beyond the preliminary stages.

Lankavatara sutra and/or Cittamatra doesn't say that there are no external beings or external objects that are produced from their own causes. It only says that we do not see them, what we see are imaginary objects (parikalpita svabhava).

"The Alaya-ocean is constantly stirred by the winds of objectivity", Lankavatara sutra, Chapter two, IX, verse 100.

Tsongkhapa and later gelugpas have produced advanced explanations of the Chittamatra view too, at least this is what Alex Berzin tells us:

Agree.

In fact, Yogacara has the "dependent nature" (see The three natures) which implies something (apart from mind) to depend on...

This is an early translation of byang chub sems, not rig pa. The former is the basis, the latter is knowledge of the basis, according to ChNN.

Dzogchen practice, for him, meant discovering that knowledge so one lacks doubt, and continuing in that state regardless of appearances, concepts, and so on. For example, once the real meaning is discovered and confidence gained, one should be able to practice trekcho in the middle of all activities, and in the middle of a profusion of concepts. Trekcho is not a mind-based activity, but mind based activities cannot interfere with it.

Personally I take the past lives material as upaya.   I'm in the camp which doesn't much like the term "enlightenment", as misleading and prone to cause grasping.

I don't know what bodhi, as Supreme Knowledge, is (to take the dictionary definition).   Anything I can think or say is deluded to some extent, the more eloquently and nuanced I make it the more subtly deluded.   Hopefully that is being reduced through practice and realization.   I'm happy with that, personally.    My goal is to attain realization about grasping and suffering and as a consequence relinquish the suffering that I'm able to and perhaps help others to also, and that keeps me busy enough.

Malcolm wrote:
The term bodhi simply means to be awake. Awake to what? Awake to how affliction causes suffering through dependent origination, predicated on an incorrect view of reality. The Buddha explained pretty clearly the epistemological basis of awakening in the sutras. They don’t have anything to do with meditation. They have to do with seeing things as they are (yathabhuta).

If some assert mind is an emergent property of matter, this is the annihilationist view for the simple fact that when that material basis ceases, that mind is annihilated. Likewise a permanent consciousness is utterly divorced from a material basis, since matter is obviously impermanent, and this is the eternalist view. They are not seeing how things are.

Though in dependent origination mind is given primacy, the continuation of the interdependent relationship between mind and matter avoids both these extremes, but it also bears the consequence that there is no beginning to the process of the interaction between a given consciousness and matter, hence, the logical necessity of accepting beginningless rebirth in order to fully grasp the meaning of the Buddha’s teaching, as well as emptiness, nirvana, and so on. This is “seeing how things are.”

You may, or may not, also be aware that ChNN used to use the word "George" to refer to the recognition of the nature of mind, at least that is what I was told.

Malcolm wrote:
You've either misremembered what you were told or were misinformed.

"George" was a reference to the primordial state, aka the basis (ye gzhi). Rinpoche called it "George" because in the audience of that teaching was a man by the name of George Blaha. I know this to be a fact since I was there. It was a joke. But the point of the joke was that terms do not matter much as long as everyone understands what the signifier is signifying.

Rinpoche used the term rig pa in two ways: 1) resting in a moment of unfabricated consciousness (instant presence) and 2) the recognition of the basis (primordial state), depending on context. He always made a hard distinction between the basis (the primordial state) and rig pa, the recognition of the primordial state.

So one has George, whom one either does not know (ma rig pa) or whom one knows (rig pa). Once one knows George, one will always know George, no matter what and despite the presence of a multitude of concepts. If this were not the case, ordinary people could not have the experience of either instant presence or recognition of the  basis.

There is nothing here to add,
nothing to remove.

How wonderful Malcolm. So none of the teachings given to Westerners by masters such such as Chokyi Nyima Rinpoche, Garchen Rinpoche, HH Dalai Lama etc, have any value unless one can speak Tibetan. Unless I have misunderstood, you seem to be saying that anything that is not translated by you is meaningless. The arrogance is astounding.

Malcolm wrote:
Westerners are often mislead by their own assumptions of what English words mean, since they have no access to the original language.

Take for example the term ye shes: there are two kinds, mundane and transcendent. So how do you translate lokajnana, ‘jig rten pa’i ye shes?  Mundane wakefulness? There are a whole history of issues here with people tossing around citations they didn’t translate, and frankly, do not correctly understand.

I know quite well what the Tibetan is for “thought free wakefulness” because it is just EPK’s signifier for nirvikalpajnana, mi rtog pa’i ye shes; I also know how it is used over a broad range of textual traditions— it does not mean the same thing from system to system.

It’s actually irresponsible for people who are not educated in textual systems to debate dzogchen in fora such as these. All they do is introduce themselves to error, cause doubt, and continue in that state forever.

That’s why we are not in a debate. I know much better than most people what these texts mean. If I say that concepts are not a problem for Dzogchenpas, it’s because i know this to be a fact, based on 30 years of concentrated study and practice of these teachings in their original language.

Similarly Buton and 3rd Karmapa, both eminent scholars and contemporaries of Longchenpa, were totally quiet on the issue at least in their major works.

If you think that concepts are something other than this "natural state," you have missed a key point. If you think a concept is the natural state, you have missed a key point.

The point here is grasping/holding. To be "nonconceptual" is to be free from grasping concepts in Dzogchen. One also does not reject or block concepts, anymore than the sky blocks clouds. The sky does not hold clouds, it does not block them, or try to find a gap between clouds. Clouds just arise from the sky and vanish back into it. This is why concepts are not a problem for a Dzogchen practitioner.  If there is movement, fine; if not, fine.

There is this verse from the Space of Vajrasattva:

Pristine consciousness (ye shes) arises from conceptuality.

Shri Simha expands it's meaning as follows:

A citation states:

Asserting nonconceptuality is a major concept. 

Claiming that the cause, nonconceptuality, can give rise to the result, pristine consciousness, is an error. Why is that so? [the notion] that the result of omniscient pristine consciousness can arise from a concentration of the cessation of all concepts is a misconception concerning cause and result...the automatic cessation of thoughts and concepts has a samsāric result. Since the root of the three poisons is ignorance, one will be born either as a long-lived deva or as an animal.

Similarly, Sakya Pandita has stated:

Those who meditate mahāmudrā incorrectly
will be reborn either as an unconscious deva or as an animal.

Shri Simha continues:

Suppose cause and result are nondeceptive. If this is true, all phenomena of samsāra and nirvāṇa will be erroneous, and become become false and will contradict outer and inner direct perception. A citation states:

People of little faith
who assert a nonconceptuality that lacks concepts
have a major concept. 
The lethargy of the cessation of six senses
cannot possibly give rise to omniscience.
If it arose, it would be impossible, as cause and result are erroneous. 

And:

Nonconceptual meditation is a huge misdeed, 
[taking one] nowhere than the three realms.

Again, the question here is the meaning of “nonconceptual.” According to ChNN, it does not mean there are no concepts, simply that one does not chase or follow them; gnosis, because one has recognized the nature of the mind directly.

Since neither self nor other are conceived, 
the nonconceptual, uniform transcendent state is shown.
When all sentient beings of the three realms realize that,
they are the same as all buddhas.

These are the three valid cognitions we accept in Buddhadharma: testimony of a reliable witness, direct perception of undamaged senses, and inference. These three valid cognitions are also accepted by the world.

Hi
I was looking at the Medicine Buddha practice by Karma Chagme in Lotsawa House. In the colophon, it says:
If you recite this mantra according to the severity of the disease, whether a hundred, a thousand, or as many times as you can, you should have no doubt that all illness (other than that due to the ripening of past karma) will be pacified. This is clearly stated in both the long and short medicine sūtras.

Where it says "other than that due to the ripening of past karma", isn't ALL sickness due to the ripening of past karma?

Malcolm wrote:
Of the 404 kinds of illness, 101 are karmic illnesses which cannot be addressed by medical means. There are another 101 minor illnesses which require no treatment, 101 illness which require treatment, and 101 demonic illness which require ritual methods to overcome.

Also, one should be aware that the ultimate cause of all illness is grasping at a self; the indirect cause of all illness is the three afflictions, desire. hatred, and confusion; and the direct cause of all illness is the three doṣas, vata, pitta, and kapha. Karma, action, is caused by the three afflictions. So ultimately, sickness can be a karma-vipaka, but karma is not the cause of illness, it's a condition for illness.

Rebirth occurs because of the habit of I-making. When that habit is eradicated, then one has control over birth. It may not be "provable" to those commoners with ordinary, contaminated, undeveloped sense organs, but it is verifiable by those who make the effort to cultivate samadhi and the deva eye, etc. That community has found rebirth empirically validated amongst themselves.

I disagree. One thing that certainly survives the death of the body are our actions. Our ability to help beings certainly can survive the death of the body. Through your children, those you influenced for the good, maybe through books you wrote or charitable giving you made. Our karma ripples out long after we are gone.

Malcolm wrote:
One's karma does not ripple out or ripen on anyone else. This is a common misunderstanding of karma in the West. As the Buddha says:

"'I am the owner of my actions (kamma), heir to my actions, born of my actions, related through my actions, and have my actions as my arbitrator. Whatever I do, for good or for evil, to that will I fall heir."

One cannot be an heir of one's actions, if, at death, one's continuum utterly ceases.

One's acts on the other hand may and can affect others. Action (karma) and deeds/acts (kāra) are two separate words in Sanskrit, with different meanings. In English this distinction is not as precise, since "actions" and "deeds" are synonymous. It is mostly a translation issue.

Karma is intention and intentional physical and verbal acts. The vipaka or ripening of such intentions and intentional acts is what most people mean when they say, colloquially, that was my karma. But in fact while our acts or deeds can affect others, their ripening, positive or negative, ripens only on ourselves.

It renders the bodhisattva vow meaningless, and so on. Since the Buddha clearly taught rebirth as crucial to his model of liberation, without which it is pointless, one is better off practicing some secular discipline since one cannot really say that one actually has confidence in the Buddha's teachings, since one rejects his own observation that rejecting rebirth is wrong view. It's like being a Catholic and rejecting the seven sacraments of the church. But this topic (rebirth is tired).

Just sharing something from Jigme Lingpa that is relevant to the discussions at hand:
Individuals who have already familiarized themselves with the two accumulations to a great extent and have attained great strength in terms of
their knowledge and meditative absorption may traverse these paths in a more direct fashion. Such individuals are carried instantaneously from the
path of joining through the paths of seeing and cultivation. Through this, they proceed to the ultimate path. There are also some with exceedingly
powerful minds who move straight from the path of joining to the state of buddhahood. A tantra states:

Some perfect the five true kāyas in sixteen,
From the class of mastery itself,
While others progress from the state of the great seal
To the unexcelled state of Samantabhadra.

With this in mind, one might begin to wonder whether or not the second buddha, master Padmasambhava, attained realization gradually, as the examples above seem to indicate. That, however, would be a misunderstanding. As texts such as the Enlightenment of Vairocana and the Secret Sphere of the Moon point out:
In the joyful realm known as Akaniṣṭha
Buddhas become fully enlightened
And then manifest enlightenment here.

This was also the case with Buddha Śākyamuni. Although he became enlightened and perfected his own abandonment and realization an incalculable number of ages ago, he nevertheless manifested the twelve deeds in this realm.

Malcolm wrote:
The Vajra Bridge commentary contains Vairocana's last testament:

"After an illusory person
illusorily practices
illusory Dharmas
they attain illusory full buddhahood. 

Through the space-like practice
with the space-like mind essence,
space-like full buddhahood is attained.

The yoga is like the heart of the sun,
the meaning of the nonduality of A ha ho ‘i cannot be made clear or obscured."

Ācārya Vairocana spread his arms wide, and just as a the tip of a rainbow vanishes into space, he vanished into light and departed without physical remains.

Malcolm wrote:
Correction, this is how some teachers these days present things, but not all teachers. Not all teachers are teachers of Dzogchen, even in Nyingma.

But teachers of Dzogchen teach two things very consistently. Guru yoga is the main entry for Dzogchen practice. The main point of common ngondro is guru yoga. One does not need a fancy ngondro with lots of beautiful Dzogchen words. It is sufficient to just recite, for example, Lama la khyab su chi'o. Da la byin gyi lab tu sol. (།བླ་མ་ལ་ཁྱབས་སུ་མཆོའོ། །བདག་ལ་བྱིན་གྱིས་རླབས་ཏུ་གསོལ།): Guru, I go to you for refuge. Please empower me.

Other kinds of deity practices involving the two stages are not necessary. And even when it comes to the two stages, the approach is not like the approach in Geluk and Sakya, where you have to spend years developing visualizations in a very precise and detailed way. Merely thinking one is the deity, is, as Padmasambhava states in the Khandro Nyinthik, quite sufficient.

It is good to develop experience in the two stages, especially the completion stage, because Dzogchen has a similar body-based approach to awakening, where there is a clear connection between concepts and vāyu and so forth in the body.

But it is never the principle of Dzogchen teachings to construct an conceptual mandala in your mind to cut clinging to concepts about impure appearances, and dissolve this conceptual mandala in order to cut clinging to concepts about pure appearances.

However, like anything in the Dharma, it is good training and that is why people do it.

But Dzogchen practitioners do not take this as their path. This is why the Kun byed rgyal po says, for example:

The mandala of the five families of victors
is accomplished through the three samadhis and the five abhisambodhis.
Engaging in the mental effort of the samadhis and abhisambodhis
contradicts nonconceptual, effortless natural perfection.

All Lamas who have studied Longchenpa well know these things. Whether they choose to teach these things to their students is another matter. That's up to them and the karmic fortune of their students.

Malcolm wrote:
Who said applying methods was a distraction? Dzogchen has it's own set of methods, set out very clearly in the original tantras of Dzogchen. For example, no one (but Sakyapas) freaks out if one states the simple fact that Sahaja Mahāudra is grol lam, the path of self-liberation, and does not involve the two stages, as opposed to the Six Dharmas of Naropa, which is thabs lam, and does involve the two stages.

But for some reason, when someone says that the two stages are not part of Dzogchen practice proper, everyone has a Chernobyl-level meltdown.

Dzogchen is not a gradual path. Just accept it and move on.

From these polemics comes the discussion of self-power and other-power.

Malcolm wrote:
No. this is not a discussion of self vs. other power.

This term, dngos po nus pa, is very common in Tibetan literature, particularly in commentaries of the pramāṇasamuccaya, etc. There no way that this term can be translated as "other power."

For example, in a commentary on the Hevara Tantra, the term dngos po'i nus pa (or dngos po'i stobs, which Mipham uses interchangeably in this text), vastubala, is defined as don byed, arthakriya, which Monier-Williams defines as "an action performed with a special purpose," and which we commonly translate as "effective" or "efficient," i.e. capable of producing a result.

For example, in the text under discussion, Mipham states that "Furthermore, when carefully examined by accomplishing mantra, the coarse body is purified, and based upon the attainment of the vidyādhara level of the desire realm, one is taken into the care of the excellent deity, and one is able (nus pa) to attain the complete result of [the paths of] training and no further training and also as it is said that the path of the Secret Mantra Vajrayāna will accomplish the result in union in the short lifetimes of the degenerate age, it should be known to be truly amazing, rendering the very important meaning easily obtainable through the power of [Secret Mantra Vajrayāna's] inconceivable effectiveness (dngos po'i nus pa)."

So, the actual discussion Mipham makes concerns the effectiveness of hearing the name of Amitābha, etc. He goes on to say that aspiration to be born in Sukhavati in Bhadracāryapranidhana is a supreme, easy method, etc.

In summary, in no way does Mipham make this term dngos po'i nus pa the centerpiece of his argument for the effectiveness of Pure Land practice. Nor is it in fact an argument for some kind of other power. Instead he contrasts the amazing effectiveness of Vajrayāna—understandable because he is a Dzogchen practitioner— with the effectiveness of Pure Land practice, and rebuts some people who argue that it is inappropriate to have doubts concerning the power of the aspiration of Amitabha and his gnosis. He also makes the point, just before the passage I cited above, " Therefore, from the power of the mutual connection between the fortunate sentient being and the gnosis of the Buddha, even the difficult path of totally purifying karma is accomplished with little difficulty."

The closest to an other power reading Mipham is this, " Such great qualities accomplished with little difficulty are to be seen as the power of the aspiration and gnosis of the Buddha, and do not only arise from the ripening of the power of each sentient being." But even here, the clause "not only" is crucial, because it means, as above, that Mipham sees birth in Sukhavati as one of mutual interaction between the faith of the sentient being on the one hand, and the power of the gnosis and aspiration of the Buddha. How so? He says, " Because of the immeasurable fortune and capacity of the person and the immeasurable emanations of the Buddha, by hearing the name of the Buddha one will be born in Sukhavati as soon as one departs this life. "

Cooke makes a serious error of translation here, "Mi pham admits, “[T]he strength of inconceivable other-power (dngos po’i nus pa) is something truly fantastical (ngo mtshar che).” As we can see above the passage is referring the effectiveness of the Vajrayāna path, not the Pure Land path.

So, really, once again, I have to reject the Halkias/Cooke argument that Mipham's text represents an example of the other power doctrine in Tibetan Buddhism. It is simply not present in the text. Just because someone writes an undergraduate paper claiming something is the case does not make it the case. People should use discretion when reviewing the works of Western scholars in Buddhist Academia. Part of their stock in trade is to make and then defend novel claims in order to publish.

In a variety of Buddhist texts I've read, there seems to be an apparent failure to distinguish between the different faculties of mind.

Right now I'm reading a translation of A Precious Garland of the Supreme Path by Gampopa, with the commentary of Khenpo Karthar Rinpoche. Here is an example passage-


In this passage Khenpo Karthar claims that mind itself is the dharmakaya. Yet other Buddhist passages simply call the mind an organ of perception, the sixth specifically, following sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste.

My educational background is primarily Samkhya, in which the internal organs dubbed as a whole "antakarana" are divided into four categories- citti (consciousness), manas (grabber and arranger of sensory data, creating thoughts), ahamkara (the organ that produces egos/identities) and buddhi (faculty of discrimination).

It sounds like Buddhists are simply translating both pure consciousness itself (citta) and the small petty mind that creates thoughts both as "mind". Is my perception here accurate? If so, why are two different things translated with the same ambiguous word? It really seems like they're just trying to dumb this stuff down and they're muddling it up in the process.

They are completely different systems with different assumptions. To fully understand the buddhist model, you would have to read Abhidharma.

Here, when mind is referred to as dharmakātya, it is not mind, citta, the dharmin, but rather the mind essence, cittatā or citta dharmatā.

This kind of English rhetoric has unfortunately been adopted by many who marginally understand English and also don't know history or understand logic and this can cause a huge problem (which is why I usually try to speak to people in their own language if I can communicate in it - but really the problem is more that people who are less prone to manipulate others using false speech, untruthful speech are in the minority and English has only opened a door for the intentional dishonesty and manipulation to shine through - it's almost like a drug that makes everyone adopt the narrow view and rhetoric of a tiny village dweller and abandon critical speech and critical thinking).

For example, much of the initiatives Biden has passed, albeit, as half measures, were ideas that Sanders introduced into our discourse. He knows how things work, so he managed get his ideas voted into,policy.

Sometimes I think you mistake Anarchism, which is based on consensus decision making by committee, for democracy, which is based on voting for representatives at the state and federal level, and direct democracy at the town level, at least in New England towns. For example, for historical reasons, people living towns and cities in Virginia have far less of a role in passing ordinances, and so on, than do citizens of New England towns, where ordinances are voted on by the citizens of the town.

As  I pointed out to you before, our experience of democracy in the US is  strongly colored by where we were llive. New England has had a tradition of direct democracy since the Mayflower Compact. It’s isn’t paradise here, but New England has the strongest tradition of democracy in the US, and has always been a leader in progressive politics.

Yes, it’s called democracy. Change comes because people understand their civic duties, or they don’t. Democracy is not a centrally organized command and control system with clearly defined goals and objectives. It’s messy, uncertain, and it’s still the best thing we’ve got. The blue states are wealthy because we are liberal and progressive. We carry the weight for the red states, who all take more than they return to the Feds in taxes.

There are all kinds of ideas we can toss around, but the only thing that really matters, as Liz Cheney showed, that in a democracy, despite our disagreements, we are all committed to the peaceful transfer of power so that our votes actually matter. It is also,crucial,that liberal democracies team up. And some times this means we fight wars when our way of life is threatened. Mazzini, the first liberal internationalist, understood thus point. Liberal hegemony is “imperialistic” much in the same way that Rome was, defensively so. Liberal states do not necessarily live up to their internal ideals on the international stage, but on the other hand, the international stage is chaotic, and all state actors on that stage are acting out of self interest, and often erroneously, and clumsily. Liberal states also have to negotiate their way through myriad unfree states and autocracies. Trump proved that it is fatal to American interests to be seen to be withdrawing from our historic role as guarantors of the security of the liberal order. The fact that “more advanced” democracies are even able to survive in the EU is because the USA guarantees their security. Nothing proves this point more cogently than Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in 2014. The USA is the guarantor of the EU’s democracy. While the older EU states seem to have forgotten this point, the newer ones, like Estonia, Poland, and so on, are acutely aware of this fact. However imperfect our democracy may be, compared with fledgling democracies of the EU block, we back them up, and support their socioeconomic security. Without the US, Europe would have long ago descended into factional warfare and anarchy again. That’s just a bare fact.

Some countries may choose, like many European countries, to have coordinated market economies, favoring stability over growth. Others, like the US, Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand, choose to have liberal market economies which favor growth over stability.

When it comes to issues like healthcare, such things should not be in the free market, because average citizens cannot make good choices concerning their health care. The same goes for education. These things should be subsidized by the government. Subsidized housing, especially for the growing population of internally displaced people in the United State, is smart economically, because it reduces a huge amount of overhead. Utah, for example, provides such housing to homeless people and has saved millions.

It's interesting to read Woodrow Wilson's reflections on Democracy in American, largely considered the architect modern liberal order, penned in 1901: https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1901/03/democracy-and-efficiency/520041/. Much what he writes here remains true today, concerning our failure to completely live up to our ideals of justice, and so on, our insularity and self-centerdness as a nation, etc. However, the main point he is stressing here is the following:

kirtu said:
Democracy is a principle with us, not a mere form of government. What we have blundered at is its new applications and details, its successful combination with efficiency and purity in governmental action. We tell ourselves that our partial failure in these things has been due to our absorption in the tasks of material growth; that our practical genius has spent itself upon wealth and the organization of industry. But it is to be suspected that there are other elements in the singular fact. We have supposed that there could be one way of efficiency for democratic governments, and another for monarchical. We have declined to provide ourselves with a professional civil service, because we deemed it undemocratic; we have made shift to do without a trained diplomatic and consular service, because we thought the training given by other governments to their foreign agents unnecessary in the case of affairs so simple and unsophisticated as the foreign relations of a democracy in politics and trade, transactions so frank, so open, so straightforward, interests so free from all touch of chicane or indirection; we have hesitated to put our presidents or governors or mayors into direct and responsible relations of leadership with our legislatures and councils in the making of laws and ordinances, because such a connection between lawmakers and executive officers seemed inconsistent with the theory of checks and balances whose realization in practice we understood Montesquieu to have proved essential to the maintenance of a free government. Our theory, in short, has paid as little heed to efficiency as our practice. It has been a theory of non-professionalism in public affairs; and in many great matters of public action non-professionalism is non-efficiency.


Malcolm wrote:
The reason I point this out, is that the GOP has, since Reagan, systematically dismantled the civil service, setting us back a century. We constantly hear now of how people campaign on the promise they are not "professional" politicians, that their ignorance of how our government works is a virtue for which we should laud them, and indeed, is often their sole credential for running for office, along with their fetish for guns.

You don't understand what this means since you are not a Dzogchen practitioner: From the Konchog Chidu cycle's Sumeru Commentary:

if one does not possess the meaning that is beyond mind, 
one will enter samsara from the vehicles.


And:

The Ornamental Appearance of Pristine Consciousness Tantra states:

Although gradual entry is shown, 
it is taught as a method for the confused. 
How can this naturally perfected dharma
be entered gradually?

Generation and completion stage practices are part of the path of transformaation. Dzogchen is not part of the path of transformation. As Vimalamitra points out in the Tantra Without Syllables commentary:

There is no connate cause in vidyā. Since it has always self-appeared without being created by a cause, there is no need in the present to generate that appearance. Since it has always been intrinsically complete, where can there be a generation-stage
seed syllable? Since that is not understood, outer and inner mantra are deviations, from Mahāyoga on down...

Since there is no effort of emanating and gathering the assembly of syllables in my self-liberated appearance, there is no need for a generation stage, like [there is no need for] the syllables...
Since Mahāyoga Tantra asserts that the outer universe is the celestial mansion and the inhabitants are deities in the utterly pure relative based on words, it deviates from the transcendent state of the self-liberation of the appearances of the six relaxed senses.

So you know, maybe you should stay in your lane, where you actually know what you are talking about, i.e. Geluk systems.

kirtu said:
Liberal internationalism can be understood as a tradition of order building that emerged with the rise and spread of liberal states, and its ideas and agendas have been shaped and reshaped as these countries have grappled with the great forces of modernity. The essential goals of liberal order building have not changed: creating an environment—a sort of cooperative ecosystem—in which liberal democracies can operate by providing tools and capacities for their governments to manage economic and security interdependence, balance their often conflicting values and principles, and secure rights and protections for their societies. Liberal internationalism aims to foster international order in a way that protects and facilitates the security, welfare, and progress of liberal democracy. It is best understood as an ongoing project to make the world safe for democracy...If liberal internationalism is to remain relevant in the twenty-first century, it must return to its roots. It must define itself less as a grand vision of a global march toward an ideal society, and more as a pragmatic, reform-oriented approach to making liberal democracies safe. This reformist view sets liberal internationalism apart from other internationalist traditions.

I agree with what you are saying, since direct perception of one's own nature is a given after birth in Sukhāvatī. One small correction is that the nirmaṇakāya buddha field is the transformed land.

Malcolm wrote:
No, a natural nirmāṇakāya buddhafield is not a transformed buddhafield, that's why it is called "natural." Its a terminological difference you won't encounter outside of Dzogchen teachings.

And the experience of direct perception is not something which requires effort beyond being introduced to it.

Yes, and I have my scriptures which point out that at the end of the this eon, when life spans are ten years, the only means of liberation available before the Dharma vanishes will be Dzogchen teachings. The definitive of the lower is the provisional of the higher.  In any case, all this Mappo business is very sketchy, and Dogen rejected it completely. I am with Dogen on this one.

And you forgot, in Dzogchen, it is stated that there is no liberation outside the six realms, just as there are no buddhas outside sentient beings.

That is not the case. I am objecting to some of Zhan Li's interpretations of the Pure Land  Doctrine, what it means in relation to how he is interpreting things, especially in light of his acceptance of the idea of original liberation.

Personally, I quite enjoyed reading Honen and Shinran, though in the latter's case, I think he is a little pessimistic. As far as Pure land masters go, Ippen has a special place in my heart. One passage by Honen always struck me was his observation that he could never visualize a leaf in Sukhavati that was as perfect as the one he held in his hand on Hiei-zan. This is a profound statement on the difference between concepts and direct perceptions. And too, my favorite Amitabha image is at Eikando, which I visited in 1986:

Malcolm wrote:

In fact, Dzogchen teachings argue that even for people who cannot practice Dzogchen teachings very much, birth in a natural nirmanakāya buddhafield (what you are calling a fulfilled land) is guaranteed, provided they have the experience of direct perception of their own nature or at least do some of the Dzogchen preliminary practices as they are able.

And the experience of direct perception is not something which requires effort beyond being introduced to it. Once you see it, you cannot unsee it. The main difference is that one attains full buddhahood in these buddhafields within five hundred human years, not the millions of years one is normally assigned to spend in a given pure buddhafield. Otherwise, most Dzogchen practitioners attain buddhahood in the bardo of dharmatā, which comes between the bardo of death and the bardo of rebirth.


Zhen Li said:
While if one were to attain buddhahood here and now one would not be separate from Sukhāvatī, focusing on attaining birth through Nembutsu or after receiving Shinjin does not necessarily result in such a realisation—at least intellectually.

Malcolm wrote:
You've defined shinjin above as dharmakāya. One cannot receive something which is innate, unless you were exaggerating, and wish to retract that statement. Dharmakāya is not something that can be given, it is not substantial.

Zhen Li said:
One reason why a traditional Buddhist might be skeptical of Dzogchen is that it comes across a lot like secular Buddhism or modernism. They both have many people who claim to have attained the goal of the path without any of the marks or signs of buddhahood, and dismissing all material that seems provisional as useless or a distraction.

Malcolm wrote:
There is no goal in Dzogchen, there is no where to go. The state of liberation is one's primordial state, it is one's start point. One simple has to recognize this and cultivate that. All one needs to do is be directly introduced to it, and develop confidence in that. There is an allegory in the Dzogchen tantras about the gem Amṛta, which one only recognizes one has lost when it has been found:

This precious gem, Amṛta,
which has been my gem,
has been lost since beginningless time.
Because of that, there was aimless wandering in suffering.
That great gem, Amṛta,
cannot be found through searching,
but is realized to be the vidyā self-originating
from oneself.

The precious gem, Amṛta,
is not noticed when lost; it is noticed when found.
There is no substantial sign when it is lost;
when it is found, radiant joy is possessed.
Since it is realized to be the same state,
there is no difference between when it is found and when it
is lost.

If one has some condition such as illness, etc., which makes developing your knowledge and understanding of the teachings difficult, Dzogchen has many methods for addressing these issues.

Now, Dzogchen is traditional Buddhism. So a traditional buddhist should not be skeptical of it. Why? Because it is fruit of all that one could wish for. As for the notion that buddahood is defined by external signs such as a retractable penis and so forth, we know very well that the Chan tradition rejects this, and the Dzogchen tradition also rejects this. Why? Because this is rejected by the Vajracchedika, which is the common source both traditions use to reject this idea. Unlike the Chan tradition however, the Dzogchen tradition maintains that the signs are manifest from their potential internally, and that at the time of death, when attaining liberation after the confines of the body have been broken, one manifests them all, just a garuda hatches with all abilities fully present, or a lion cub is born with the same. Since there is no occasion for rebirth after rebirth where such external signs can manifest, their potential is developed without being externally visible due to the a) the rapidity of the path and b) the fact that these signs are a naturally perfected potential as kāyas and gnoses in our primordial state form the beginning. They only require secondary conditions to manifest, just as a crystal produces a band of color when exposed to sunbeams but otherwise seems colorless and clear. Our body is that crystal, and these kāyas and gnoses already exist in our body as a potential. This is why tantras like Hevajra state, "Great gnosis exists in the body, but is not of the body." Also the potential for all of samsara and nirvana exist in our body as well, including the potential for all buddhafields, pure and impure alike. If we did not have the potential for Sukhavati as a part of our basis, our continuum, we could never take rebirth there, shinjin or not.

Zhen Li said:
Admittedly, from the ultimate perspective, we can dismiss all else as useless. However, a Buddha knows the inclinations of beings and so manifests according to the karmic inclinations of the sentient being. Upāya is the compassionate working of the Buddha, and I would like to know why Dzogchen dismisses it.

Malcolm wrote:
Dzogchen does not dismiss them. You forgot, above, I mentioned there is a direct approach and an indirect approach in Dzogchen teachings.

The advantage of Pure Land, as I see it, is the embracing of upāya. This is why Hōnen dismissed the typical objection (which you also raised) that the intellectual should not debase himself by practicing Pure Land

Malcolm wrote:
There is no problem practicing Pure Land Buddhism, it is not an obstacle to practicing Dzogchen teachings. In fact, practicing Dzogchen teachings will make Pure Land practice more effective, just as it makes Vajrayāna practice more effective or even simple śamatha and vipaśyanā. One does not have to wait to see buddhafields at death, or in the next life. One can have a direct glimpse of them in this life, since a buddhafield is nothing other than the potential of gnoses that already exists within oneself. The obstacle here is indulging in the erroneous rhetoric that beings of this age are so benighted as to be unable to do any other than hope for a birth in Sukhavati. Again, the Buddha states:

“The purity of his buddhafield reflects the purity of living beings; the purity of the living beings reflects the purity of his gnosis; the purity of his gnosis reflects the purity of his doctrine; the purity of his doctrine reflects the purity of his transcendental practice; and the purity of his transcendental practice reflects the purity of his own mind."

The appearances of Sukhavati are pure only in so far as the person's vision is pure. Since a person's mind is innately pure, the realization of that original purity is sufficient for entering all buddhafields at the same time everywhere without impediment.

Zhen Li said:
—rather, it is a method for the attainment of buddhahood by all.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course it isn't. Like all dharma paths, one has to cultivate roots of merit in the past to even meet the śrāvaka dharma let alone Mahāyāna, so slogans like "it is the path for everyone" are at base hollow. "Soteriological" realism suggests that only Buddhists, who of their own accord, have entered Mahāyāna are going to meet Pure Land, Dzogchen, Chan, Vajrayāna, etc. In general, Buddhadharma only only for the karmically fortunate, hence the importance of reflecting on the preciousness of a human birth with eight freedoms and ten endowments.

Zhen Li said:
Despite this, people of different karma cannot be made to see things the same way, which is why I post this in the Pure Land forum.

Malcolm wrote:
I am not talking to all people, I am talking to you. You are a learned scholar, but, and I don't mean this to be disrespectful, you have built a conceptual box for yourself.

You've shared that you didn't feel your ten years of Soto practice was fruitful. I am not saying this to use this against you, but with sympathy. I also don't quite believe you. Dogen's writings are among the closest expression in Japanese thought to Dzogchen teachings.

You claim Pure Land practice is for simple people without capacity, but in Dzogchen teachings we say, "One hundred butchers will attain liberation faster than a learned scholar" because of this point of direct perception. Shabkar states in his famed text, The Soaring Garuda (not the same as the text I previously quoted):

If this [Great Perfection] is practiced, all [fortunate ones] will be liberated;
there is no distinction between sharp and dull capacity.
If one practices, even a cowherd will be liberated.
If one understands the significance of the luminosity of one’s mind through a direct perception,
the rhetoric of scholars is not necessary here;
just as when one eats sugar,
there  is no need for an explanation of the taste of sugar.
Without understanding this, even a paṇḍita will be deluded.
Even if one is skilled in all the explanations of the nine vehicles,
it is like telling a story of a distant place one has not seen;
one is even further from the stage of buddhahood than heaven is from the earth.

We like books, we think they provide a firm foundation, but reality, relying overly much on textual authority is like sailing a boat on a river, ignorant of where the sand banks are.

Anyway, enough. Good luck.

Yeah, looks like in ZZNG, tsal = rolpa according to Nyingma although I'm still not sure if in both schools, the meaning of "nature/clarity" differs. If you don't mind me asking, you have received ZZNG before right? Is the meaning different?
There is a serious amount of confusion about this point among western translators, who unintentionally conflate sarma terminology with Nyingma terminology. However, there is a text called Eighty Axioms which clearly describes the distinction between gsal and rig.
I practice both streams of Dzogchen and it would be very helpful if it was more obvious whether a lama in Bon was referring to the same thing as that Nyingma lama said or whether you have to forget what each of them said when you are following the other's teachings. Unfortunately, it looks like even the Bon terminology differs in meaning from that of the 17 Tantras even if words are the same

Most sentient beings at present do not not have the karmic fortune to meet Buddhadharma, let alone Dzogchen teachings.

Liberation only comes about through recognizing one's primordial state, even in Sukhavati. Why wait?

Malcolm wrote:
Liberation requires recognition that one's mind is already dharmatā, and that everything has always been in a state of uniformity. The Soaring Garuda states:

The nature of primordial buddhahood exists as direct perception,
but like the example of the form of a shadow, conceptuality about that arises.

There is only one means to liberation, everything else is a deviation:

The bliss of perfection free of activities is accepted because there is no desire.

The commentary continues:

Since the undeceived method is free from activities through the topics of the perfections and does not accept anything, not wishing to attain freedom because suffering is not perceived is the sublime method of attaining freedom.

The wish of someone, who is already liberated, for liberation is itself a deviation. Liberation is not an attainment, it is a recognition. Obscurations are not substantial. As it is said by Nāgārjuna and others:

Here, there is nothing to add, 
nor is there something to remove. 
Correctly see the real. 
Seeing the real is liberation.

Advertising to sentient beings that they must put off their liberation for birth in a pure land is a disservice to sentient beings. You wrap yourself in numerous contradictions by claiming on the one hand, that on the one hand mysterious blessings of Amitabha transcend time, but that sentient beings have to be open to his grace and on the other hand that buddhas and bodhisattvas are inactive. Vajrasattva states:

The three times are single, undifferentiated, 
not arisen from the beginning, without earlier and later, 
due to being single because of being pervaded by dharmakāya, 
the primordial nature of greatness abides because of the greatness.

The Soaring Garuda states:

There are no phenomena to add because one kāya pervades all.


Although you assert original buddhahood, you insist there are ordinary sentient beings; you make erroneous distinctions between the two truths and so on.  You do not actually accept original liberation, because if you did, you would automatically accept that Amitabha and sentients beings are nondual and that there is no Sukhavati that is some other dimension than these three realms. The Soaring Garuda again:

Since there is no object to attain, there is nothing other than the three realms.

Because the three realms themselves have attained buddhahood already in the essence of natural perfection, it is ascertained that a result generated by a cause is not a separate object to be attained. 

Even relying on the tenth bhumi is an obstruction to awakening. 

The seeking that relies on the path method of the tenth bhumi of the causal bodhisattvas and the wish to attain by relying on the tenth stage of outer, inner and secret secret mantra does not see the place that is free from being traversed. 

The extremely rapid wisdom is free from all thoughts.

That being the case, because the self-originated wisdom, the basis of everything, is free from gradual progression, it is more rapid because of emphasizing nonprogression through mere seeing. Since that is free from all goal-oriented apprehension of objects and apprehending subjects, it is very special because there is no obscuration to purify.

In your shinjin, there is still a goal to attain, even though this is clearly a deviation. Your baseline assumption is that there is a subject who is obscured and an obscuration to purify; someone to take birth, and a place to take birth, thus your view is contaminated by holding the three spheres to be existent. Likewise, with your view of merit transfer from Amitabha, there is someone transferring merit, merit, and a recipient of merit. But in reality this not so, as the Vajracchedika points out.

This does not apply only to you, this applies to all paths of cause and result. People don't need to do anything other than relax and allow their obscurations to vanish, just as turbid water becomes clear when the particulate settles out. And obscurations are no different than dharmatā, they emerge from dharmatā and vanish into dharmatā just as clouds emerge from the sky and vanish into the sky or waves in the ocean, without coming or going anywhere, they have no substantial nature.

Honestly, you resemble the guy who carries the oar, even though you left the boat at the bank. And since there is no other shore in reality, you don't even need a boat. All you need to do is discover your own nature and then help others see their own.

If one accepts original liberation, encouraging people to enter paths of cause and result is like telling someone who is holding an apple that they still need to go pick an apple in order to be able to eat the one they are already holding.

In this degenerate age, the only effective path is the path of direct perception. We do not have time to mess around with theories of sūtra and mantra, accumulation and purification, birth, cause and result, etc. These are all just proliferation.

It is precisely because we live in a degenerate age that the best path for sentient beings is the path where they recognize there is no difference between afflictions and gnosis, that there is no "better place" than the three realms, etc. This is exactly the message the Buddha gives in the Vimalakīrti Sūtra 's first chapter. Amitabha's pure land is exactly the same as this billion world realm.

It may make us feel more secure to pray to a powerful being, accept what we infer as their blessings, etc. But in reality, we are already complete with nothing more to add, neither samsara nor nirvana exist, we just need to meet teachers who have this knowledge and then we can realize this ourselves without any effort at all in this life, or at worse, in the bardo or the next life, without ever having to be concerned about returning to samsara.

As for your claim that your tenet is equivalent to ati yoga, no, since you keep insisting on a hard demarcation between buddhas and commoners, based on your "liberative realism." Since there are no saviors in Buddhism we really ought to avoid the term "soteriological."

Atiyoga offers another kind of liberative realism, one is already liberated, one simply needs to get out of one's own way to discover this. The Inner Potential again:

Nondual great bliss is the continuous practice of sentient beings,
though demonstrated as a mistaken path by the deluded.
Since there is no duality in the great path demonstrated above,
the one who understand sameness is the lord of all buddhas.

Mañjśrīmitra writes:

Therefore, because awakening and nonawakening are the same in terms of absence of characteristics, there is nothing to accept or reject.
In accordance with that meaning, all those explanations

nonduality, beyond thought, emptiness, the dharmadhātu,

Zhen Li said:
This is simply a question of soteriological realism. In the Pure Land tradition it is admitted that Buddhahood is impossible by the power of the ordinary being, the conventional level. Awakening is always on the side of Buddha Nature. This is the gist of the Nirvāṇa Sūtra.

Their appearance of action and cultivation is what happens when their activity comes in contact with our limited minds.

So, from the side of awakening, it is realised very much that in fact the curtains are actually opened by the Buddha. The appearance of needing to open is only something manifest to our unawakened cognition.

This power to open the curtains is illustrated in narrative form by Dharmākara's ten aeons of cultivation, and the wholesome roots which he dedicates to us for our birth. On the other hand, Amitāyus' life is infinite and he is the primordial Dharmakāya. Conventional and ultimate interacting.

Buddhahood does not exist, apart from delusion, as Mañjuśrīmitra writes:

...

Deluded by the immature, because one is been placed on a path of conceptual Dharma practice
it is not the path to traverse, at no time will one becomes realized. 
How can dharmatā be found by seeking Dharma?

Thus, there is no basis for your claim which distinguishes buddhas and commoners. That distinction is false and cannot be established.

Malcolm wrote:
The value of what I wrote is that it can be understood by anyone.

Furthermore, since our obscurations are not caused by some other being, likewise our liberation can not be caused by some other beings, nor can some other being act as a condition for our liberation. Liberation can only be self-liberation, whether that occurs in this life, the bardo, or a buddhafield. And that self-liberation will never be a result of effort, or causes and result. As Vajrasattva says:

Liberation is self-originated, not from another.

And the Soaring Garuda states:

The nature of primordial buddhahood exists as a direct perception.

The commentary states:

Since the all migrating beings of the three houses are embraced within wisdom that lacks a center or periphery from the beginning, there is no one else to designate a buddha, buddhahood exist as a direct perception of one’s vidyā.

Therefore, no distinction needs to be made between buddhas and ordinary beings, since direct perceptions are not dependent on words and concepts, and buddhahood is immediately attainable in this life without effort.

I only mention this because you keep insisting that beings of this age are so benighted that they cannot understand anything. This is not true, and Atiyoga has an opposite narrative.

Right now, there is push by moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans to create a third, centrist party, because the Republican Party has been completely taken over by fascists at the top, and a lot of people on the right, who are not fascists are freaked out by progressives in the Democratic party and disgusted by the fascist takeover of the GOP.

In reality, there are four factions in the US party politics: social and fiscal conservative Republicans; socially liberal, fiscally conservative Republicans; right-leaning Democrats, and Progressive Democrats. Joe Manchin and Sinema are right-leaning Dems. The fascists who now control the GOP are a small minority, but they have a lot of money.

The problem with our system is 1) the amount of money in our politics, not the two party system; 2) lack of civic education about how our government is actually supposed to work; and 3) the willingness of a portion of our electorate to raise up a tyrant due to that ignorance.

Correct, there is no contradiction between those two statements.

"There is no such thing as an "ordinary being," just buddhas with temporary obscurations."[/quote]

Correct, their two stores are complete, but they are temporally obscured; their stores of merit are latent.

You assert these originally liberated beings need an infusion of merit from the Buddha to take birth. There is no contradiction in my position, but there remains one in yours.

A Buddha cannot will a being into awakening, but he can transfer merit to allow us to be born in Sukhāvatī if we are willing to accept it.

Malcolm wrote:
I would say that it is from the deluded perspective (ours) that we consider buddhahood to be attained upon birth. But upon attaining buddhahood, this temporal duality drops away.
This says nothing more than Haribhadra's observation that that when buddhahood is realized, one realizes one was never not a buddha.

So you are basically claiming, from a deluded perspective, things like merit transfer and so on are necessary to take birth, and that merit transfer depends on a kind of prasannacitta, but that in reality it is all illusion. Why bother with nembutus or shinjin at all, when understanding that there is nothing apart from dharmatā is sufficient for buddhahood in this life, since that is illusory too?

Second, this perception of a mistaken field of experience by the six kinds of migrating beings with misconceptions is the correct path which is not traversed, the meaning of primordial buddhahood just as it is since self-originated pristine consciousness that is unfabricated and unsullied self-appears. As it is said:

Also the appearances of the six destinies
must be understood as the first path

If that is realized, because of just that, one arrives without having traversed [a path].

What is the path free of effort?

"That being the case, through there is a meditator, he does not engage in mentation about the object, dharmatā, not even using the word “meditation”. Since the mind essence is whatever dharmatā is, intrinsically never stirring from intrinsic clarity is called “meditation” conventionally, but it is ascertained to be objectless. Just like space, intrinsically never stirring because there is no inside or  outside, the mind neither extends or withdraws, there is nothing to negate or prove, there is no arising and entering, there is no hope and fear, there is no gain or loss, there is nothing clear or unclear, there is no activity of concentration to perform.

Correct. It does not even actually transfer (if it did, it would be compounded, impermanent). If it did, all sentient beings would have a full store of merit at all times, because out of their compassion, all buddhas would always transfers their infinite merit to everyone, and if this were effective as claimed, all sentient beings long ago would have have attained buddhahood already. Primodial buddhahood is useless if one's afflictions are still in play.

Pure Land descriptions abound in Buddhist literature, and from a literary history perspective, they are clearly a Mahāyāna development and went onto influence garden literature in later Sanskrit works.

There really isn't a clear non-Buddhist precedent for this and the Sukhāvatīvyūha and Aṣṭasahasrika manuscripts come out with these descriptions at about the same time.

Even Migtsema can be a Dzogchen practice, if one understands the principle of the three vajras and their relationship to the three family protectors. After all, the very first text, after his namthar, in the Lhasa edition of Tsongkhapa's collected works is a Dzogchen text.

cloudburst said:
The Dzogchen text you reference here also states that it is "essential to meditate on the mystic deity (yidam)"

Malcolm wrote:
Some people need to rely on an indirect method to realize the meaning of Dzogchen. Mipham comments on this indirect method discussed in Mañjuśrīmitra's Cultivation of Bodhicitta:

2.8 The explanation of the method for realizing the definitive meaning with the indirect method:

Furthermore, since the teacher has declared that awakening can be correctly grasped with a symbol,
in that case, this is the basis of the meditation that generates awakened mind. 
After the three samadhis are stable and after binding the three symbolic mudras, 
generate the mind as the great dharmamudra and meditate the recitation of the essence [mantra].

If it is asked, “What is the method for realizing the definitive meaning through the indirect method?,” since nonactivity is illustrated with the activity of fabricated efforts, like pointing at the moon with a finger, also awakened mind correctly grasped through a symbol will accomplish awakening because the Bhagavan Buddha, the teacher of devas and humans, has declared that it is “great awakening.” Any unfortunate one who conceptualizes entities should make efforts in the indirect method of realization. 

In that case, this which is to be explained is the basis or cause of the meditation that generates ultimate awakened mind itself. If it is asked what that is, it is samadhi and mudra. 

Now then, through the power of cultivating the three samadhis of suchness, universal illumination and the cause, [14/a] one will be stable, and not carried away by negative conditions. After the meditation of binding the three symbolic mudras of buddhahood— the body (mahāmudra), the mind (samaya mudra), and the activities (karmamudra)—generate the mind as the great dharmamudra (the symbol of speech). One should then meditate the recitation of the essence mantra.

If one meditates generating the thought that the samadhis and the mudras are dharmatā and therefore are not different, the ultimate awakened mind will arise. If one actualizes the meditation, one realizes that all phenomena do not exist apart from one’s mind. The accumulations are gathered and obscurations are purified because of that meditation. One becomes realized because one’s continuum is blessed by the deity of pristine consciousness.

This is more or less the approach of the elaborate Chime Phakma Nyinthig. There is also, in the root text, and indication of an Anuyoga approach, as well as topics more directly proper to Dzogchen specifically.

So what is the direct approach? Again Mipham comments:

2.7.2.1

Nothing is to be abandoned with regard to the emergent or the non-emergent. A foundation of mind is not erected. There is nothing to realize.
Even the slightest movement which is not Mañjuśrī is [Mañjuśrī]; there is no abiding there. 
Because a ground on which to meditate is not attained, nothing is attained by meditating. 
Those consciousnesses that are the domain of the mind are the dharmatā of phenomena. 
Meditate on this supreme path that is free from aspects and also free of best or worst. 

Nothing is to be abandoned with regard to the emergent. A foundation of the mind is not erected for the non-emergent. There is nothing to realize through the perception of a result or a true meaning. 

If it is asked why nothing is abandoned, since there is no pain in dharmatā, it is gentle [‘jam, mañju]. Since it is glorious, if that [dharmatā] is realized, it is “glorious [dpal, śrī].” If the movement or existence of the slightest subtle fault of sign or concept which is not that dharmatā is seen, since that is the ultimate pristine consciousness of dharmatā or Mañjuśrī, it is not to be abandoned. If it is asked where there is abiding in that dharmatā or Mañjuśrī, since there is no basis in which to abide because the nature of [dharmatā or Mañjuśrī] is not established at all, there is no abiding there. 

Because a ground on which to meditate cannot be attained, who will attain a result by meditating on something? [12/b] Dharmatā is the phenomenon of any of the mental concepts (of any appearance of an aspect) that arise from that consciousness (which is the domain of the mind). Since all domains are not apart from dharmatā, anything whatsoever appearing here is faultless. 

If it is asked, “If there are no faults, for what reason are there sentient beings?,” it is because they grasp various signs as true. In order to explain that there is no samsara if there is freedom from the aspect of clinging to true signs, because all phenomena are free from all aspects of signs, there is no grasping to any phenomena. Meditating without the aspect of accepting and rejecting, for example “This is the best and this is the worst,” is the supreme path. Meditate continually on the path like this.

The actual path of Dzogchen, which has nothing to do with the two stages, is just as stated above.

The point in Pure Land is that its power is manifested through Dharmākara's vows and brings people to a point where they can realise it themselves. Buddhānubhāvena (by the Buddha's power) is how many people achieve all sorts of things in the sūtra literature—the realisation, however, is for themselves alone and not forced upon them by the Buddha.

In that case why wouldn't Sukhavati be a so called 'training ground'? It provides an optimal state of existence for beings to attain awakening.
To overcome reliance on self power is to directly see one's true nature.

PS.

Rinpoche had, obviously, his family. He also has his students, whom he himself encouraged, in a traditional fashion, to regard each other (and him) as family. Some people have tried to do it, but Rinpoche's family in the first sense of the word wants now to define the limits here, effectively establishing in what sense, to what extent, etc. Rinpoche's students are his/their family in the second sense. Understandable, of course. But if those who are now told not to share the photos/videos of their beloved master the way they share the photos/videos of their loved ones feel bewildered and possibly hurt, it should not come as any surprise either.

I still cannot understand who is caused pain when people share lovely, funny or charming photos of a person they all deeply cared for. Myself, I will eagerly comply, of course, with the wish of the family. In all my life I shared the sum total of some three photos of Rinpoche's online and I am perfectly OK with stopping at this point. Still, cui bono?

And perhaps he is not implying that the Cakras actually move like the planets, but is just showing it as an example as to how their energies if you will (or vayus rather) are interrelated within the Chakra system.

11. Which are in Asia signifies to those who are in the light of
truth from the Word. Since by all the names of persons and places
in the Word the things of heaven and the church are meant, as was
said before; thus also they are meant by “Asia” and by the names of
the seven churches therein, as will appear from what follows. The
reason why they who are in the light of truth from the Word are
meant by “Asia” is because the most ancient church and after it the
ancient and then the Israelitish church were in Asia; also because
the ancient Word and afterwards the Israelitish were with them;
and all the light of truth is from the Word. There were ancient
churches in the Asiatic world and they had a Word which was
afterwards lost. Lastly, there was the Word which is extant at this
day. This may be seen in Doctrine of the New Jerusalem concerning
the Sacred Scripture (n. 101–103). On this account it is that by
“Asia” is here signified all who are in the light of truth from the
Word.

[2] Concerning this ancient Word, which was in Asia before the
Israelitish Word, it is fitting to relate this news: That it is still
reserved there among the people who are in Great Tartary; I have
spoken with spirits and angels in the spiritual world who came
thence, who said that they possess a Word, and have possessed it
from ancient times; and that their Divine worship is performed
according to this Word; and that it consists of mere
correspondences. They said that it also contains the book of Jasher,
which is mentioned in Joshua (10:12, 13), and 2 Sam. (1:17, 18),
and also, that with them are the books mentioned by Moses, as the
Wars of Jehovah and the Propheticals (Num. 21:14, 15, and
27–30); and when I read to them the words quoted thence by
Moses, they examined whether they were extant there, and found
them. From these things it was manifest to me that the ancient
Word is still with them. While speaking with them they said that
they worship Jehovah, some as an invisible, and some as a visible
God. Moreover they related that they do not suffer foreigners to
come among them, except the Chinese, with whom they cultivate
peace, because the emperor of China is from their country. And
further, that they are so populous, that they do not believe any
region in the whole world to be more populous; which is very
credible from the wall so many miles long, which the Chinese
formerly constructed as a safeguard against invasion from them.
Seek for it in China, and peradventure you will find it there among
the Tartars.

But as the very philosophy of Masonry teaches us that there can be no death without a resurrection,--no decay without a subsequent restoration,--on the same principle it follows that the loss of the Word must suppose its eventual recovery.

Now, this it is, precisely, that constitutes the myth of the Lost Word and the search for it.

The central argument in citizens United was that since corporations are associations of people, they should also enjoy freedom of speech as do natural people; and since spending money to distribute one’s message is an integral part of speech, then corporations should be able to do that too.

Up to that point, it’s hard to argue with.  The argument completely ignores that we regularly put limits on individuals’ ability to contribute money to political causes and that we also impose transparency requirements on political spending for individuals, while under Citizens Utd it is possible for non-natural persons to be subject to no spending limits and no real transparency requirements.

Gunman Tried to Breach Cincinnati F.B.I. Office, Officials Say: Live Updates

Man suspected of trying to breach the F.B.I.’s Cincinnati office may have Jan. 6 ties.

Investigators are looking into whether the man who tried to breach the F.B.I.’s field office in Cincinnati on Thursday had ties to extremist groups, including one that participated in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, according to two law enforcement officials familiar with the matter.

The suspect, identified by the officials as Ricky Shiffer, 42, seems to have appeared in a video posted on Facebook on Jan. 5, 2021, showing him attending a pro-Trump rally at Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington the night before the Capitol was stormed.

In May, a Twitter user named Ricky Shiffer replied to a photograph of rioters scaling the walls of the Capitol on Jan. 6 with a message that claimed he was present at the building and seemed to place the blame for the attack on people other than supporters of former President Donald J. Trump.

“I was there,” the message read. “We watched as your goons did that.”

Mr. Shiffer was not charged with any crimes in connection with the Jan. 6 attack.

In another Twitter post, the same user wrote about the far-right nationalist group the Proud Boys.

“Save ammunition, get in touch with the Proud Boys and learn how they did it in the Revolutionary War, because submitting to tyranny while lawfully protesting was never the American way,” the message read.

A representative for the F.B.I. declined to comment.

Not really. Freedom means being free from afflictions. This is same in Hinayāna and Mahāyāna, the insight that burns away the afflictions is fundamentally the same, and the same fetters are relinquished at the path of seeing of both vehicles. The real difference is whether the practitioner aspires to full buddhahood or not. The latter is typically is said to require eons of practice gathering the two accumulations in order to gain (a limited species of) omniscience as well as freedom. This is the reason why sudden awakening is contentious in Mahāyāna schools, with some like Chan/Zen, Dzogchen, and Mahāmudra, accepting the concept, where as other schools, generally Indian-based general Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna reject the idea. In the case of the latter, they merely theorize that the special methods of Vajrayāna allow one to gather the two accumulations required for buddhahood in a single lifetime.

The NBER says the "traditional definition" of a recession is "a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months."

Employment is a part of the group's calculus, and the labor market has continued to show signs of strength. In June, the unemployment rate held steady at 3.6%, which is near its pre-pandemic low, and the economy added 372,000 jobs.

"I don't think the NBER would look at the data right now and say the economy is in a recession," says Michael Gapen, the chief U.S. economist at Bank of America Securities.

But it's unclear how much Americans will care about whether the current economy satisfies a specific, highly-technical definition, or it doesn't.

Actually, NDE researchers have done all that--- but within the narrow band "near" death but obviously prior to irrevocable death. But yes, it is not actual death, which is why they are called "near death" experiences. But the point is not that they are in fact actual representations of what happens when we pass the point of irreversible death, rather the point is that with diminished brain function, there is an incredible experience some have that is unlike other experiences (dreams, hallucinations, etc.). It is merely one part of a growing challenge to the physicalist notion that consciousness is produced by the brain (example include terminal lucidity, hydrocephaly where people with 5% of the their brain function normally; etc.).

Of course, a more relevant discussion might be had by digging into what Dr. Greyson's DOPS colleague Dr. Jim Tucker has recorded with respect to past life memories of young children, including intermission memories from death to rebirth.

A dream by Buddhists definition is not the same as a dream by western science definition. You assert these things are not dreams based on a physicalist paradigm.

Aṣoka was hardly a virtuous king. After he converted to Buddhadharma, he had 18,000 Jains executed on the basis of a cartoon. He placed a price on the heads of Jain mendicants, until his own brother was killed by a farmer and his wife for the bounty. They mistook Ashoka's brother for a Jain mendicant, and brought his head to Ashoka for payment.

The divine right of kings as well as absolute monarchy is rejected by Aryadeva. He points out kings rule only by the consent of the governed, thus rejecting absolute monarchy. The Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas, p. 118, states:

Society's servant, paid with a sixth part, 
why have you become so arrogant?
Your becoming the agent of actions
depends on being placed in control.

The above passage also is relevant to the tulku system and so on.

The rest of the chapter demolishes the idea advanced in this rather late Mahāyāna sūtra:

Konchog1 said:
Blessed by divine kings they enter into their mother’s womb; being first blessed by gods, afterwards, they enter her womb.
Once born in the human world, they become kings of humans. From gods they are born; thus they are called ‘divine son.’

Malcolm wrote:
On this point, Aryadeva rejects the divine right of kings, p. 127:

When all power and wealth
are produced by merit, 
it cannot be said that this one
will be not a basis for power and wealth.

In other words, it is the accumulation of merit alone that determines wealth and power, not some divine benediction from worldly devas. And further, everyone can gather merit. So everyone is equal.

Thus, I regard the sūtra passage above to be completely provisional, culturally determined,  and something which can be safely ignored in the modern context. Its general message about wicked rulers, etc. is totally fine.

This was acutely demonstrable during the Hoover Administration, and later, during the Trump administration.

Democracy, the nonviolent transfer of power, is an extraordinarily delicate form of government. This is why liberal democracies formed alliances with each other in the early twentieth century, surviving both fascism and communism. These alliances need to continue to foster liberal democracy, as Ukraine so clearly shows. It's a matter of our survival. Recall that the first impeachment was over Trump's attempt to undermine Ukrainian democracy by blackmailing them with weapons in order to try and get dirt on Biden.

Dzongsar fails to understand this as he spends all his time listening to old fools like Chomsky (so far left his positions are now rightwing) and Mearsheimer (appeasement).

Well, you do have veridical OBEs, in which a person reports leaving their physical body and observing the external environment--- at the time of a flatline in some cases, or the expected flatline (i.e. 15-20 seconds after cardiac arrest). We can then check their observations against witnesses who weren't undergoing OBEs (doctors, medical staff etc.). We can then compare their reports against people who did not have OBEs but who have undergone the procedures, and compare the accuracy. In addition, NDErs may report highly idiosyncratic behavior (such as a surgeon flapping his hands like a chicken). This can assist in correlating the timing.

Malcolm wrote:

It's all still completely anecdotal at this point.

The problem with the whole Buddhist NDE thing is that it mixing systems, science on the one hand, with its definition of death; with Buddhism, especially Tibetan Buddhism, with its much more elaborate definition of death.

From the western Medical POV, flatlined patients will not survive more than five minutes.

Matt J said:
Most of these resurgences in heart activity occurred between 1 or 2 minutes after the heart had stopped. They were usually only  a single heartbeat long, or less than 5 seconds in duration.

The study suggests that protocols around organ donation should stick to the 5-minute convention, given that no one's heart restarted again after a gap longer than 4 minutes and 20 seconds, Dhanani said. Transplant teams should be prepared for the possibility that they might have to adjust their timing if a patient's heart does restart. Ultimately, he said, the research should help standardize organ donation processes internationally.

Referenced article:

This means that all these NDE's and OBE's are occurring within a five minute period, and this means that consciousness has not left the body, etc. There are occasional outliers, like the woman in Spain whose heart started beating again after six hours, because she went into hypothermia:

Matt J said:
Hypothermia had protected her body and brain from deteriorating while unconscious, Mr Argudo said, despite also bringing her to the brink of death.

In a race against time, doctors treating Mrs Schoeman turned to a specialised machine capable of removing blood, infusing it with oxygen and reintroducing it to the patient.

Once her body temperature had reached 30C, they used a defibrillator to jump-start her heart some six hours after emergency services were contacted.

Mrs Schoeman was released from hospital 12 days later, with only some lingering issues with the mobility and sensitivity of her hands due to the hypothermia.

He added: "If she had been in cardiac arrest for this long at a normal body temperature, she would be dead."

I keep repeating my claim: Yes, there IS something very specific about Vajrayana that directly plays into continuation of abusive teacher/student relationships. It is the practice of guru yoga in the widest sense, including seeing the guru with pure perception. This does not exist as a practice in any other Buddhist tradition in the same sense, at least not that I'm aware of, and it is both one of the core practices in Vajrayana that can have a tremendous growth effect - yet also one of the core contributing factors to cover up any sort of bad conduct on the guru's side. Stating that Vajrayana is just like any other religion with regards to abuse is avoiding this one point. It's not, and that is both its beauty and its ugliness.

What is NOT exclusive to Vajrayana is the claim that any teacher/holy person has some sort of transcendental, intangible, elusive magic sauce that nobody can really judge except if s/he himself has the same sauce. This claim exists in various forms in nearly every religion, be it christianity (e.g. pope who is somehow closer to god), shamanism (the shaman has a direct connection to an other-world that can neither be proven nor disproven), various schools of hinduism, and so on. In some religions it is that the magic sauce is some inspiration from god, in others it is a special knowledge that supposedly takes years and years of studies, in others yet it is rather to be born in a lineage of special people and so on. In any case, the belief that someone else has access to that secret magic sauce and one has not and therefore is capable of having deeper understanding than oneself including situations of cause and effects of abuse, this same belief equally supports the upkeeping of abusive teacher student situation.

Vajrayana has both problems to deal with, other religions have only one of them to deal with.

Malcolm wrote:

In the 1970's, there were a lot of 13 year girls running around getting involved in relationships with older men. It's mostly bad parenting, and while illegal, no one did anything about it if the parents said nothing. Trungpa himself married a 16 year old, whom he had met when she was fifteen. People in the 1970's were not particularly conscious of the fact that it was necessarily wrong to sleep with underage women. For example, the former headmaster of my private school began a relationship with the a 14 year old (to whom he remains married to this day actually) in 1979. People's attitudes were simply different. A lot of things that people find abusive or cringy, etc., were accepted. Now, of course, these things are not very accepted at all. But then? If the parents didn't mind, well, then there was no problem.  Note, I am not defending it, this was just how it was when I was an adolescent in the 1970's. I remember camp counselors striking up relationships with some of the 14 year girls at my camp, pretty openly. circa 1974-5. If you were an underage girl, and you were sexually active, everyone considered you pretty much fair game.

Parenting had a lot to do with. Hippie parents often would not interfere with their kids. Partly because they did not want to place the sexually repressive values they suffered from in their adolescence on their own kids. Things are far more uptight now.

Depends on the experience and depends on who you ask. Despite protestations to the contrary, TB teachers often refer to NDEs (their own or others) as related to the Bardo process (Tulku Thondop and Mingyur Rinpoche, for example).

Malcolm wrote:
NDE's are usually a result of traumatic shock that will result in an untimely death without intervention. But since the process of dissolution is interrupted, they don't count "death" experiences since the consciousness never actually separates from the body.

Indeed, there is a method of temporarily reviving a person who is dying, so that instructions concerning bardo of dharmatā can be imparted, but actual death in a Buddhist context does not happen until the inner breath stops, and consciousness leaves the body. Since the process of dying and sleep are related, it is pretty clear that NDE's are akin to dreams when the patient is being revived. So, if they are bardo related, it is the dream bardo, not the death bardo, to which they are related, in my opinion.

No they are not contradictory. You are continuing again to twist my words here. I never claimed that "legally somehow there could not be consent in voluntary relationships between a teacher and student".

I clearly stated in my original post that I was talking about sexual misconduct. That includes harassments, assault, etc. When it comes to spiritual teachers and students this is usually coerced through the abuse of power differential. There is no consent here. Again, I will re-post for the 3rd time, from the sexual assault attorney:

Malcolm wrote:
Your original post framed in the issue in such a way that any relationship that involved a power differential could not possibly be consensual. Either you think all teacher/student relationships that involve such power differential render consent impossible, causing all such relationships to be instances of misconduct, or you don't. It's binary.

If you think some teacher student relationships are not misconduct, then you are also admitting that power differentials are not a fact that defines misconduct, there must be some other facts in play.

In my view it's about time that we understand spiritual teachers to be none other than coaches, essentially. There is no magic sauce here, just because we are dealing with things like "enlightenment" and the like. A teacher is not only supposed to be a good teacher, but s/he is supposed to have some elusive realization that nobody except a fully realized buddha can judge, and of course nobody knows who a fully realized buddha is.

Malcolm wrote:
One's guru can be a coach from their own perspective, but from one's own perspective it is better to understand they are a fully realized buddha. And since we have impure vision, when we practice Guru yoga, etc., we rarely visualize them in their own form, but rather in the form of Vajradhara, etc.

fckw said:
So, by this very logic a teacher's authority is established not by qualities such as learning and qualities in teaching but first and foremost by some transcendental, elusive realization that nobody has ever seen or touched, and that we all must believe is there, because, well, because <reason>.

Malcolm wrote:
The teacher's authority is established through one accepting someone as one's guru, fully understanding the parameters of the relationship. Sadly, many people jump into such relationships, both teachers and students, without proper examination. It is a little harder from the teacher's side, because of course we want everyone to connect with whatever teachers we offer, not for personal gain (hopefully), but because we believe in the teachings we have to give. The students have an easier time, because they can observe a given teacher for a long while and make sure a relationship with them will be fruitful before entering into a samaya relationship.

When vidyā manifests its own primal nature, the mental consciousness manifests as self-originated wisdom, and then the pure basis of the mental consciousness (free from the root of apprehending subject and apprehended objects) bring samsara to an end.

It looks like that idea was what is the underlying Tibetan term translated as Pure Perfect Presence because between the various modern English translators, they seem to maybe translate different words by the same English term, e.g., in different place both rigpa and bodhicitta seem to end up as "presence", which is somewhat confusing.  I think the idea was to determine if here it was rigpa or bodhicitta being called "presence", and it would appear that it is the latter.

Malcolm wrote:
The term being translated as "presence" is sems, citta. There is no subject or object in byang chub sems because byang chub sems in the "mind series" term for emptiness free from four extremes.

Longchenpa describes this as follows:

"Bodhicitta, which is not established in any way, becomes the basis for everything, like space. It's potential (rtsal) has an unceasing mode of arising. like a mirror. Play is the phenomena arising as the diversity, like the eight examples of illusion. These three, from the perspective of emptiness, are nondual because they are not established in anyway. From the perspective of appearance, from the moment cognizance (rig pa), sleep, and dreams arise one after another, they have the nature of being without any basis, appearing as  bodhicitta, potential, and play. These, from the perspective of their essence, are beyond singular and diverse phenonena, from the perspective of appearance, they are conventionally described as three. When having defined their essence, when defined conventionally, since it is invalid to for play and bodhicitta to be the same, from this perspective, play is divided into appearances and apparent objects. Though there is neither inside nor outside, thorugh understanding the eight examples of illusion, though phenomena and their characteristics, and so on, are designated, it is the position of the system of the Great Perfection that they are a great, nonexistent, clear appearance."

Yes. It is not our path.

And when they finally meet the Dzogchen path, they usually give up practicing the two stages, other than for prophylactic reasons such as long life practice, sang offerings, protectors, etc., practices that deal with our adventitious karma conditions.

100% pecent sure. Rig pa arises from ma rig pa at the time the appearance (the five lights) of the basis arose from basis (one's unfabricated consciousness), which was taken as an object, and was recognized to be one's own state. Because of this, for example, Samantabhadra attained buddhahood without entering into delusion and without engaging in a single virtue, and we entered samsara's delusion without engaging in a single misdeed. Rather than recognize the appearances of the basis as being our own state, we imputed self and other on to them, etc. This is all really very clearly explained in many places. If there were no appearance, potential (rtsal), for ma rig pa to mistake for being "other," there would be no means by which rig pa could recognizes the appearances of the basis as its own state. Even the term "recognize" implies, conventionally, something which recognizes and something which is recognized.

If you want to quibble over whether rtsal is an object or not, go ahead. Just be aware that while ka dag can never be a basis of delusion, both lhun grub and thugs rje are the basis for delusion, and this would not be possible if they did not present as objects. Thus is why I am 100% sure.

In this respect, the volcanologist, who was also a member of the UK government’s Natural Hazard Working Group, takes an extreme position. Most other climate experts still maintain we have time left, although not very much, to bring about meaningful reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. A rapid drive to net zero and the halting of global warming is still within our grasp, they say.

Such claims are dismissed by McGuire. “I know a lot of people working in climate science who say one thing in public but a very different thing in private. In confidence, they are all much more scared about the future we face, but they won’t admit that in public. I call this climate appeasement and I believe it only makes things worse. The world needs to know how bad things are going to get before we can hope to start to tackle the crisis.”

McGuire finished writing Hothouse Earth at the end of 2021. He includes many of the record high temperatures that had just afflicted the planet, including extremes that had struck the UK. A few months after he completed his manuscript, and as publication loomed, he found that many of those records had already been broken. “That is the trouble with writing a book about climate breakdown,” says McGuire. “By the time it is published it is already out of date. That is how fast things are moving.”

Likewise, the result is inalienable.

That all compounded things are suffering does not rule out compassion or ethical behavior. The path consists of the accumulations of merit and wisdom. These are carried on for many lifetimes and many kalpas. Compassion for the suffering of sentient beings is an integral part of the path. Health, wealth, food, clothing, shelter, body, education and property  are impermanent and subject to change, but nevertheless giving them to beings is an integral part of three paths, it is not only the bodhisattva path.

Chapter 3.    "Penetrating the Characteristics of What is to be Known" - discusses the path to awakening (mārga),
Chapter 4.    "The Causes and Results of this Penetration", discusses the six perfections (ṣaṭpāramitā),
Chapter 5.    "The Divisions of Cultivating These Causes and Results" discusses the ten stages of a bodhisattva (daśabhūmi).
Chapter 6.    "Training in Superior Discipline" (śīla),
Chapter  7.   "Training in Superior Samādhi"
Chapter  8.   "Training in Superior Prajñā"
(Result)
Chapter  9.   "The Relinquishment That is the Result of This training", discusses the “transformation of the basis” (āśrayaparāvṛtti)
Chapter 10. "The Wisdom That Is the Result of This Training", discusses Buddhahood, the Dharmakāya.
So, I think that "basis, path and result" is a perfect way to organize this digest and it is not just a tantric thing but its a way of organizing the dharma that can be found in non-tantric mahayana.

There are specific Dzogchen preliminaries, which are indispensable, but I guess what you asking is how many people who practice Dzogchen do so without having done the common and uncommon preliminaries. It's kind of a misstated question. Most Dzogchen teachers introduce Dzogchen teachings immediately, and then assist their students in helping them find the appropriate secondary practices, which might be ngondro, or some yidam, etc. The main practice of a Dzogchen practitioner is guru yoga, and that is included in any ngondro. Even Migtsema can be a Dzogchen practice, if one understands the principle of the three vajras and their relationship to the three family protectors. After all, the very first text, after his namthar, in the Lhasa edition of Tsongkhapa's collected works is a Dzogchen text.

It may be that they never really understood the Bodhisattva vow anyway. A lot of people think it means that you have to love everybody all the time blah blah blah. The buddhist path is a long process, like a tree growing. Maybe a bodhi tree. A few years is just scratching the surface.

Malcolm is correct in that this fits the definition, technically, by way of what is written in the sutras. But you know the person better than anyone on this forum. You should your best judgement. The purpose of abandoning bad company is that they interfere with your dharma progress. If this person is keeping you from practice or causing a lot of confusion for you, then yeah, limiting interaction is the best advice. But if hanging out with this person isn’t really a problem for you, and this is a friend, then use your best judgement. Being honest with yourself is also a very important part of dharma practice, because You are always your companion in the journey.

Malcolm wrote:
Shantideva recommends that while we greet childish people with pleasant demeanor, we avoid intimacy with them.

From a Vajrayana point of view, a person who has abandoned bodhicitta has committed one of the 14 root downfalls. It’s one thing if they regret their decision, but if they don’t, one should strictly avoid them. Knowingly associating with such people itself is a branch downfall.

Malcolm wrote:
Tibetan Medicine is basically Ayurveda imported to Tibet. Classical Ayurveda does not have concepts for things like gluten-sensitivity either. The Ayurvedic ideal is that one should be able to eat anything, and if one cannot, it is due to impaired digestive heat, which has three components, kapha, pitta, and vata, in descending order. Inability to digest proteins is likely an issue with kledaka kapha (myag byed bad kan) and pacaka pitta ('ju byed mkhris pa) not being able to break down gluten protein, which results in a feeling of bloating, indigestion, etc., This nutriment can't be properly separated by the samana-vata (me myams rlung), resulting in maldigested nutriment being sent to the liver, where it becomes stressed, overheated, and then there are resulting symptoms of food sensitivity in terms of rashes, and other pitta symptom. So the treatment here would be to strengthen the digestive heat with a combination of conduct, diet, herbs, and certain therapies. and of course the details all depend on what kind of prakṛti (rang bzhin), or constitution one has—vatta, pitta, kapha, vata-pitta, vata-kapha, pitta-kapha, or tridoṣic—and what kind of vitiated (vikṛti, rnam par 'gyur ba) doṣa (nyes pa) one has at the time

You will also be incontact with the Bodhisattvas and Buddhas of the three times, Protectors and Deities that are mentioned in the sutra. They are the real source of meaning of the sutra. (Even in Theravada the higher paths are taught telepathically, -says Dipama.)

Shunyatagarbha said:
Perhaps there's something in what you say but isn't this sutra saying that the Perfection of Wisdom sutras, even though they teach the definitive meaning, are similar to unseasoned meals, elixirs and medicinal powders without a key ingredient, an unadorned space, or a blank canvas waiting to be completed with the grand design of the so called Third Turning sutras that supply all those final definitive dharmas, and thus the so called Second Turning is in that regard only here called provisional and unsatisfying meaning that will lead to dispute without the so called Third Turning?

Malcolm wrote:
There are differences of opinions among different scholars. For example, Longchenpa holds the tathāgatagarbha sutras to be definitive, but Sapan maintains the second turning as a whole is definitive, but the third turning contains both definitive sutras, like the Samādhirāja, and provisional sutras, like the Mahānirvana.

In terms of what goes where, there will be inevitable overlap. And that is ok. The Avatamsaka, for example, defines itself as the definitive sūtra for practice, thus most of its contents would be included in the union of method and wisdom. For example, the wonderful chapter on faith, which begins, "The mother of all qualities is faith," etc. A sutra like the Bodhisattvapiṭaka will be in the path section as well, like the pure land sūtras, and your addition of a laukika section the path is good. Generally speaking, readings from sūtras can be placed in different places. Readings from the ārya-subāhu-paripṛcchā-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra on the five aggregates, etc., from the  Śālistamba-sūtra nice for the basis because the concerns dependent origination of samsara, aggregates and so on, the basis of purification of the path, etc. Passages detail the nature of affliction, karma, etc.

Passages from the Samdhnirmocana can be included in all three, as can passages from many sutras.

Here's a quick statistic that tells you why the Dem party does not represent working people:
In 2018, according to ProximityOne, a website that analyzes the demographics of congressional districts, Democratic members of Congress represented 74 of the 100 most affluent districts, including 24 of the top 25. Conversely, Republican members of Congress represented 54 of the 100 districts with the lowest household income. The median household income in districts represented by Democrats was $66,829, which is $10,324 more than the median for districts represented by Republicans, at $56,505.

The 2018 data stands in contrast to the income pattern a half-century ago. In 1973, Republicans held 63 of the 100 highest-income districts and Democrats held 73 of the 100 lowest-income districts.

Ah statistics...keep in mind that it wasn't really until Regan that all the Southern Democrats has fled the Democratic party, and many northern Republicans were shifting to the left, and joined the Democratic Party. What you are looking at is not working class vs. upper middle class (well, in a way), what you are seeing is a split between the North and the South along the Mason-Dixon line. The North is and always has been wealthier than the South apart from a brief period between 1830 and 1860.

Furthermore, the formula "thus I heard at one time" is evidence that someone related something the Buddha was purported to have said after the Buddha passed into Nirvana.

It has been unusually dry, however, because of the heat in the rest of the country. Where I live is 1300+, so it is always 5 to 10 degrees cooler than in the valley or on the coast, places like Boston. We had three days of intense heat, but that has now passed. This is quite normal weather for New England. The worst impact of climate change for us, so far, is decreasing snow packs, and more intense tropical storms.  Biggest issue? Humidity. People who live in deserts will find the humidity of the PNW and the NE daunting.

Sure, it's a natural concern. That doesn't mean that it aligns at all well with the basics of the Buddhist path - you know, things like compassion for all living beings.

Sure, we can look after ourselves and our loved ones, but extending that to the whole world becomes a matter of acting on behalf of the community, in the community. And we can define 'acting' and 'community' as narrowly or broadly as we like, just so long as we do get out there and act.

When it comes to the provenance of texts, there has been as much dispute among Tibetans over the validity of this or that sūtra or tantra as there has been among Western scholars.

And if Tibetan masters like that quoting from a presumably apocryphal text don't lend it any authenticity as an Indian text then the lack of such citations of the Shuramgama Sutra is irrelevant to the argument for or against its subcontinental provenance since the logic here has it that such citations don't mean anything either way.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct, provenance is irrelevant to content. You should read. Buswell’s treatment of the text. There is no way it isn’t apocryphal.

Malcolm wrote:
His views are explicitly partisan, since he claims to represent “orthodox Buddhism,” in contrast to Tibetan Buddhism, which he regarded as corrupt. He also has strange views concerning rebirth and so on, so, frankly, not a reliable authority.

No, and the text is entirely lacking a colophon describing who translated it into Tibetan and it has no Sanskrit title.

However the fact that it was included in the Ldan dkar catalogue certainly bolstered its support in certain quarters. However, Buswell's case that it is a Korean composition is pretty impenetrable.

Now that Tibetan teachers today are speaking in the same way about the Shuramgama Sutra, perhaps they are both authentic sutras spoken by the Buddha himself.

One does not need Buddhism to practice meditation, ethics, compassion and so on, thats my point. Buddhism offers very little in these regards which one cannot already find in secular philosophy and ethics. Hume, for example, negated an integral self, etc., asserting "a self" did not exist as such. And indeed, western ethics are much more sophisticated and clearly articulated than the simplistic, catechistic ethics taught in Buddhism.

Buddhism offers a very precise solution to a very precise question. The problem is that most people do not understand Buddha's question, which is how to put an end to rebirth, which is suffering. This is the reason the Buddha and arhats in general declare upon their awakening that they will not undergo further birth.

I am not telling you what to believe. Whether you believe in rebirth or not is irrelevant. The Buddha taught rebirth, and it is in this context that all his teachings are to be understood.

Definition[1]	：
般剌密諦

He was one of the great translators in China. Paramiti in Sanskrit means 'Extreme Amount' (極量), indicating that his talent and his wisdom were both extremely ample and full. Śramaṇa Paramiti smuggled The Śūrangama Sūtra (楞嚴經) from India to China in the Tang Dynasty. He accomplished his works very quickly so that he could get back to India on time without punishment. After he finished his translation, he went back to India and confessed to the King, and asked to receive whatever punishment the offense incurred.

As the Director of Translation, he stood at the head of more than five hundred Dharma masters who had assembled to work on the translation. The work was done with over 200 scholars and monks at the Chih Chih Monastery (制止寺), a large monastery in the City of Guangzhou.

Start of the text itself: Chinese Rendering by Master Paramiti of Central North India at Chih Chih Monastery, Canton, China, Ad 705

It’s good that you raise this Malcom.

It is an interesting fact that you say that, while Eric Pema Kunsang, a renowned translator of Tibetan texts, holds it in the highest regard, as someone else in this thread already mentioned. Thus your statement is false on its utterance.

Malcolm wrote:
Actually, it is more interesting that you engage in such a vitriolic response to a simple statement of fact, there is no evidence for an Indian original for this text. This is just not even a matter of dispute. Whether text is held in high esteem by such and such a person is irrelevant to the verification of its provenance. For example, many people esteem the Tārā Tantra, but Ngorchen claims it is a Tibetan forgery.

I merely repeated what is well known to everyone: thus far not one person has shown that even a single citation of this text can be found outside of Chinese-based sources, even in the few places among Tibetan writing where it is mentioned. It isn't found in either of the two extant imperial catalogues.

The text gets a mention by Buton, but he does not state from which language it is translated, so even this is not certain. For example, Gampopa cites the Vajrasamadhi Sūtra, which actually exists in the Kenjur, but it is well established that this sūtra was written in Korea.

Moving away from the issue of provenance, I never said the dharma taught in the Śurangama Sūtra was invalid. I just said there is no evidence for an Indian original. It's up to you to provide evidence for such an original, not based on the touted authority of tulkus and khenpos, but based on evidence. Thus far, there is none, other than a single mentioned by Buton. That isn't sufficient. Buton accepted many texts into the Kenjur and Tenjur disputed by later scholars such as Tsongkhapa and Ngorchen.

Exactly how karma works, I do not know.

PadmaVonSamba said:
Well, karma doesn’t actually “work” or “not work”, because it isn’t really a “thing” like gravity. It’s not some kind of cosmic force.

Simply put, all phenomena (appearances, ultimately) arise from conditions. And everything that arises or occurs becomes some of the conditions for other phenomena to arise. This is where karma becomes inseparable from sunyata (emptiness) and dependent arising.

Rennigeb said:
So what's the role of karma on emptiness and dependent arising? Why is it inseparable from emptiness on the arising of appearences?

Malcolm wrote:
There is a progression from causes and conditions (both outer and inner phenomena) --> dependent origination (causes and conditions of sentient beings) --> karma and its ripening (the causes and conditions of virtuous, nonvirtuous, and neutral volitions, their physical and verbal expressions, and the consequences of those expressions).

Karma paints the canvas of emptiness and appearance with happiness and suffering.

The main point of Buddhism is to eliminate the three afflictions—confusion, hatred, and desire—which are the cause of actions which inevitably result in suffering. Awakening has no other purpose for oneself than this.

This idea of definitive and provisional comes about from guys trying to classify sutras after the third turning. The third turning was called definitive because it is resolving questions about Buddhahood that are left open in the first and second, namely what is buddhahood exactly and whether emptiness is all there is to it, that emptiness relates with what is to be negated, appearances and self and when obscurations are taken out of the equation what remains is not impermanent. Nothing there implies existence. The Mahaparinirvana Sutra does say if you think Buddhahood is just emptiness you are like a moth falling into a flame.

Malcolm wrote:
There are a variety of problems here. 1) there is only one passage in all of the sutras that define three turnings, the Samdhinirmocana. 2) The Indians completely ignored this division of sūtras, which I have show elsewhere. 3) Tibetan interpretations of this are so varied as to render the doctrine virtually meaningless. 4) Not all of the so-called third turning sūtras can be accepted as definitive. 5) Mādhyamikas use a different sūtra to ascertain the distinction between definitive and provisional, the Akṣayamatinirdeśa:

What are the sūtras of definitive meaning and the sūtras of implicit meaning? The sūtras that are taught in order to help one enter the way are called implicit, while the sūtras that are taught in order to help one reach the fruit of the way are called definitive. The sūtras that are taught in order to demonstrate the relative truth are called implicit, while the sūtras that are taught in order to demonstrate the ultimate truth are called definitive. The sūtras that are taught in order to help one engage in actions and duties are called implicit, while the sūtras that are taught for the sake of the cessation of actions and afflictions are called definitive. The sūtras that are taught in order to explain affliction are called implicit, while the sūtras that are taught in order to explain purification are called definitive. The sūtras that are taught in order to produce disgust for existence are called implicit, while the sūtras that are taught in order to help one enter the nonduality of nirvāṇa and existence are called definitive. The sūtras that are taught with various words and syllables are called implicit, while the sūtras that teach that which is deep, hard to see, and hard to understand are called definitive. The sūtras with many words and syllables that are taught in order to please the thoughts of living beings are called implicit, [F.150.b] while the sūtras with few words and syllables that are taught in order to produce mental introspection in living beings are called definitive. The sūtras that, with various words, proclaim a self, a being, a life principle, a life-sustaining principle, a spirit, a personality, a human being, a man, a subject that acts, and a subject that feels and those that teach that there is a ruler where there is no ruler are called implicit. The sūtras that teach emptiness, the absence of distinguishing marks, the absence of anything to long for, the unconditioned, the unborn, the unoriginated, the nonexistent, the absence of self, the absence of being, the absence of soul, the absence of person, the absence of spirit, the absence of ruler, and the gates of liberation are called definitive. This is called the reliance on the sūtras of definitive meaning, not on the sūtras of implicit meaning.

“The non-dual tantra of glorious Hevajra is the ultimate perfection of all classes of tantra. It is the profound, unsurpassed and quintessential yoga. In the noble land of India, Naropa, Maitripa, Krishnacharya, Samayavajra, Virupa and his disciples Padma Vajra, Shantibam and many other lineage holders have appeared. In Tibet, Marpa Lotsawa, Lotsawa Drogmi and Go Lotsawa have transmitted the lineage.


This particular empowerment ritual stems from the transmission lineage of the great accomplished master Shantipa, the lineage gurus of the innate Hevajra with consort, according to the transmission lineage of Lord Drikungpa, and his disciples is as follows: Buton Rinchen transmitted the lineage to his heart’s son Rinchen Namgyal then it was transmitted through the scholar, Chandrakirti, the master Yeshe Gyamtso, the venerable Khyenrab Chojin, Lama Rinchen Gyelpo, the mahasiddha Pema Garwang, the master, Mangto Namgyel (?), Acharya Sonam Chomphel, Shamar Garwang, Chokyi Wangchug and the master Chokyi Dragpa.”
Regarding the lineage, I received this empowerment for the first time when I was a very young child and I hardly remember it. Then again I received it from Lamchen Rinpoche and the empowerment comes from the four co-emergent deities, which is a very precious empowerment text, there are four empowerment texts in there. So this is the empowerment I’m giving now and so that’s my personal lineage. In general, it is important to hear the names of the lineage masters.”
