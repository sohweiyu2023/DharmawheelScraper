"He or she therefore studies the tantras and their commentaries."

The word in red is not "studies." It is "mnyan pa," to hear. In other words, one is encouraged to go and hear about the general meaning of "tantra" in order have confidence. For example, like the words of encouragement at the end of the Lam rim, etc., which encourages faith in Vajrayāna and briefly explains its superiority to common Mahāyāna, but it certainly does not mean studying tantras and commentaries without guidance. Moreover, it can be read that what is being encouraged here is to study with meaning of the word "tantra" itself. There is no mention of "rgyud rnams," tantras in plural, but rather "rgyud" alone. So, I think you've misunderstood this point. It is certainly fine to study what the word "tantra" means and have confidence in this vehicle. But it is passingly strange to encourage people to study tantras and commentaries, and contradicts what Kongtrul says about the need for secrecy in Buddhist Ethics (TOK, book 5, pp. 261): "(7) To disclose secrets to immature persons means to reveal the secrets of profound bliss...to someone who has not been ripened by initiation..."

Now in fairness, Kongtrul assumes this means that one should not disclose Vajrayāna methods to people interested in practicing as a śrāvaka and so on. But other masters, such as Sakya Paṇḍita, have a very different idea. Sapan remarks that this seventh root downfall includes showing one's vajra and bell, etc. or performing ganacakras, etc. explaining secret mantra, etc. to anyone who does not possess empowerment.

smcj said:
There’s always a back-and-forth between samsaric awareness and enlightened awareness. In fact one of the many definitions of “Dharma” is the connotation of enlightenment with unenlightened awareness.

For its part samsaric awareness usually has to work from outer to inner, from crude to subtle, confined to free, from blindness to seeing, etc. This can be seen in the 9 Yanas paradigm.

Enlightened awareness works from a position where it sees the Path in its entirety. It sees what the last step is for a being before awakening. It sees what is to be done 10 steps before awakening. And it sees what needs to be done lifetimes before awakening.

So when I read your citation, I understand it to mean “first” not in the chronological sense, but in the sense of the closest step to full awakening. The further away from full awakening a Teaching is you could call “later”.

Is that what you mean?

I am not claiming that one should cease to study sūtrayāna material. I am claiming however, that to deprive people of access to Vajrayāna methods is simply a gross misunderstanding. Why? Because Vajrayāna is self-sufficient method of realizing the paths and stages to buddhahood, and moreover,  it is a much more rapid path than any path sūtrayāna has to offer. My understanding of sūtra material is a result of practicing Vajrayāna, not the other way around.

I disagree. It depends greatly on the karma of the student. The Dagpo Kagyu has plenty of room for analytical Madhyamaka to help establish the correct view of ground Mahamudra. If one can realise this ground directly right away, great. But generally this is rare, and studying Madhyamaka is prescribed because if taught correctly it does not remain purely on the level of the intellect. i.e. it induces meditative experience and then realisation, in the context of vipashayana.

Malcolm wrote:
The realization of mahāmudra depends on direct introduction, not analysis. Otherwise, your mahāmudra is just perfection of wisdom meditation dressed up in dohas.

tobes said:
Moreover, Kagyu Mahamudra does not privilege non-conceptuality over conceptuality: core Kagyu Mahamudra texts such as Moonbeams are very explicit about this; discursive thought and intellect are also not distinct from ground Mahamudra.

Malcolm wrote:
"Ground" mahāmudra simply refers to something one has not yet realized, i.e., the nature of the mind. Concepts are not separate from the mind, so of course they are included.


tobes said:
So, I think this aversion to analysis is contrary to the Kagyu presentation of Mahamudra. However, it makes more sense in relation to the Indian tradition; Saraha, Maitripa etc.

Malcolm wrote:
The aversion to analysis is different than aversion to concepts. Someone who has never received any kind of introduction must depend on analysis. But this person is also not practicing mahāmudra. The fundamental distinction between mahāmudra practice and sūtrayāna practice must be introduction at the time of empowerment, otherwise the word, mahāmudra, is quite meaningless.

Recent examples include: mad cow disease, SARS outbreak, swine flu, chicken avian flu... etc. Maybe that is a big hint / Karma forces at play here?
I just watched netflix documentary s02e04 The Next Pandemic, and would personally recommend it.
Regarding the coronavirus outbreak this time, it probably started with people consuming the so-called "bush-meat," e.g., bats, snakes. However, the main cause was that the municipal and provincial governments intentionally withheld information from the public and the central authorities to the extent that once the outsiders discovered the truth, it has already been too late to contain the spread of the disease.
Quarantining a city of 11 million people is unprecedented. But at this moment, this measure will not be enough. The peak of outbreaks is expected to be late Feb to early Mar.

Malcolm wrote:
Apparently, like SARS, this came from eating civits, which in turn eat bats. Not snakes. This virus needs a warm-blooded host to survive.

Generally, three, actually. Thirteen bhumis. In Dzogchen, sometimes, 16 bhumis are discussed. And in some anuyoga presentations, there are 21 bhumis. However, in general, there are only thirteen  bhumis in Vajrayāna, generally speaking.

In terms of vehicles, in common Mahāyāna there are only śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, and bodhisattva vehicles, no fourth or fifth.

I no longer wear my Buddhist beads — Juzu blessed by a Nichiren Shu priest — in public lest I be accused of “cultural appropriation” (I actually got dirty looks from an Asian woman for my beads), and the dirty/hostile look I got from a Hawaiian woman at an SGI meeting (when she saw that I have gongyo memorized, with correct accent to boot; she was trembling with rage) was the straw that broke the camel’s back.

Making the dharma sound as pallatable and medicinal as possible rather than focussing on the obscurations of any new seeker.( that can come later, once they're suffused enough by the Dharma they already appreciate). A vast library to be explored that will unravel our assumptions gradually and over time.

Early impressions and interactions count a lot for some people and I just wonder to what degree and consequence ( if any) we move a bit too fast and heavy when speaking to new members.

(Bit of a meta-duscussion in this post but hopefully it contributes something)

A person asked a question about their experience viz, "realization," and discovered their realization does not fall within the range of right view in Buddhadharma. What's the problem?

It's just obvious there is no room in Buddhadharma for the concept that there is one universal consciousness, just as there is no room in Buddhadharma for the concept of a creator god.  What are we supposed to do? Coddle people's misconceptions in hope that if we are sufficiently gentle they will somehow wake up from their misonconceptions. No. It is better to be honest and direct with people from the start. We don't need people to become Buddhists. We need them to understand what Dharma is and what Dharma is not. Then they can make an informed choice about what path to follow.

In the constantly shifting sands of different charges over the past three years, I'm looking forward to seeing how this drama plays out in an actual trial.

There are criteria for establishing the validity of such experiences which are described in the intimate instructions of Vajrayāna.

Howver, the dream experience of ordinary people is not to be trusted.

Shiva said:
Clinging to written doctrines and concepts is as illusory as clinging to anything else, even if those doctrines claim to lead towards some spiritual realization. Realization is mainly experiential and the ultimate awareness comes as an actual empirical recognition no through rational analysis.

Malcolm wrote:
All teachings must be subject to rational analysis, as the Buddha said, one must examine teachings, including his,  in the same way a goldsmith evaluates the purity of gold: by weighing, cutting, and burning.

BTW, "empirical recognition" means that such a teaching is evaluated through the consensus of people without special knowledge or special faculties, who verify this or that fact through rational analysis. I think perhaps you mean "direct perception," such as that involved in tasting sugar, which cannot be described to someone who has never tasted anything sweet. Saying "sugar is sweet" means nothing to such a person.

However, even realization may be gauged through the kinds of experiences one has, which is why in Vajrayāna teachings, and even in sūtra, the criteria set out for what a realized person experiences is very carefully mapped in order that people who are practicing the path can distinguish between valid experience and delusion.

As for the law, the answer claims, in the most cursory fashion, that the “abuse of power” charge, at least as alleged here, "fails to state an impeachable offense.” It asserts that the abuse of power article “alleges no crimes at all, let alone ‘high Crimes and Misdemeanors,’ as required by the Constitution.” Trump’s brief gets even more explicit: An impeachable offense must involve a “violation of established law” — specifically, “criminal law.”

That’s bogus. Legal scholars and historians agree no statutory crime is required by the Constitution for impeachment and that abuse of power is in fact the essence of impeachability: The English parliamentary history upon which the Framers adopted impeachment makes clear that a public official’s breach of duty to put the public interest first constitutes an impeachable, removable offense.

Even if a statutory crime were required, the House’s charge that Trump tried to solicit a personal benefit (Ukraine’s announcement of an investigation) in exchange for an official act (releasing the security aid) constitutes bribery, both as understood in the Framers’ time and under the federal criminal code today.

Dzogchen realization is non-dual awareness; there is no difference. Anyhow, If you disagree with what I am saying that is fine for me as I do not tend to enter on arguments or debates on Dzogchen. Anyhow my suggestion to @SuddenRealization stands, he find it useful or not.

Malcolm wrote:
No, Dzogchen realization is not a "nondual awareness,"  since "awareness" is a mistranslation of the term vidyā/rig pa. Vidyā, in Dzogchen texts, refers to knowledge of one's essence (snying po, garbha). For example, the commentary of the Tantra Without Syllables, the main upadesha tantra of the view, states:

Vidyā (rig pa) is (1) the knowledge of names designated by words; (2) the five sciences (rig pa gnas lnga) such as helpful worldly knowledge like healing, arts and crafts, the treatises, and so on; (3) knowledge (rig pa) as a factor of consciousness, such as sharp and dull worldly knowledge and so on; and (4) the knowledge of the essence (snying po) that permeates all, which is free from ignorance (avidyā), unobscured by the obscurations of ignorance, and so on.

If you carefully read Longchenpa, you find out that in the view of Dzogchen, nonduality is a description of the state of all things that is free from any ontic extremes such as being, nonbeing, and so on. But it is certainly is not the state of Paramshiva described in Trika texts, which regard everything as an expression of Shiva, and thus existent and real. In Dzogchen, even Samantabhadra possessed ignorance at the time of the basis.

When one carefully studies Dzogchen teachings under the direction of a qualified person, one discovers that the promiscuous overuse of the term "nondual" anything in Dzogchen is very misleading. I am not denying that the term "nondual" is used in Dzogchen, because of course it is, but it does not mean the same thing as the nondual state discussed in Advaita and Trika. It just isn't. The Dzogchen usage is grounded in Yogacara language, in this respect, and indeed it is the Yogacarins who prove that mindstreams are independent, unique, and differentiated, while at the same time denying external objects.

On the other hand, Dzogchen does not deny external objects, which is why Longchenpa laughs at the idea that they do not exist, and provides an account in the Treasury of Citations about the relationship and difference  between outer objects (rol pa), bodhicitta ()byang chub sems) or the basis (gzhi), and the potential (rtsal) of bodhicitta, which of course is just one's personal state. If you study this carefully, you will understand that calling Dzogchen a nondual system similar to Advaita and Trika is really a huge error. You can understand that again and again, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu explains that the basis, the primordial state is personal, not universal.

In Buddhadharma, every consciousness is individual, unique, and differentiated. Otherwise, karma, rebirth, and liberation cannot function. In other words, if we are all one consciousness, then we all have the same karma, we all have the same rebirth, and we all have the same liberation all at the same time.

Shiva said:
Your affirmation sounds actually more like the Atman affirmation in Hinduism rather than to the Anatman approach of Buddhism. I understand that the question that @SuddenRealization brings is actually more similar to the idea of Shiva in Kashmir Shaivism but that same approach is non-different from a Dzogchen Realization if not because the symbolic language particular to that Indian tradition which embraces Shiva as a symbol of Dzogchen Trikaya.

Malcolm wrote:
The notion that Dzogchen and Trika are commensurate is a complete error. Dzogchen does not propose an absolute nonduality of any kind. If you think so, you are deeply mistaken and you need to study more, or better yet, study with a qualified teacher who can remove the cataract of your ignorance.

And in general, since every mind stream arises based on its own unique set of causes and conditions, mind streams in Buddhadharma are considered individual, unique, and differentiated. There are reams of Mahāyāna arguments which prove this. These individual, unique, and differentiated do not possess any svabhāva, they are free from extremes, and therefore, the fault of attributing identity to them does not exist.

1. what is the purpose of dzogchen's tsa-lung/trulkhor practices then? are they really different from 6 yogas in their goals? or Longchenpa criticises all such practices, dzogchen one included, not just sarma ones?

Johnny Dangerous said:
My understanding (via ChNN's teachings, but this accords with other Dzogchen teachers also) is that in Dzogchen Tsa Lung, Pranayamas etc. are simply part of the large collection of practices for one to become familiar with the natural state, and not the more graduated and exacting process found in the six Yogas. So, you do not need to neccessarily develop along the same lines as you do in the Six Yogas, you can just utilize such practices with less ...structure and restriction I guess.

While what you said is true, as pointed out above, that is not what we are talking about. We are talking about bodhichitta motivation. Specifically, we are talking about actions that appear negative but are in fact done for the purpose of the enlightenment of all sentient beings even though they have negative aspects. We are discussing whether an action with the negative appearance labeled "rape" could ever be done with said bodhichitta motivation or if it is a type of action that can only be done with a negative motivation such as the one you described.

pema tsultrim said:
What about the part of my post that you did not highlight? The part where by definition, rape and other forms of sexual violence are unwanted, non-consentual, forced, coerced, or done while the victim is helpless or too young to know better, and harm the victim emotionally and/or physically (I added on some, but still true)... Does the experience of the object of an action not matter? So if someone believes themselves to doing all the above with a bodhicitta motivation, but the direct recipient is demonstrably harmed and no one else benefits, then that is certainly the most unskillful means imaginable, and the agent is deluding themselves. No bodhicitta there. So I think that point was addressed, if only implicitly.


TrimePema said:
Why did you say "no one else benefits"? You need to re-read my example and then look at these passages again.
Additionally, we are not talking about someone (an actor) "believing themselves to be doing all the above with a bodhichitta motivation" we are talking about someone who absolutely IS doing the above with a bodhichitta motivation.

The discussion is whether or not that's possible and on what grounds it would be or wouldn't be.

Nine Considerations
Here are the relevant passages again:

2. Consideration of the status of beings
If something would benefit lower beings such as animals but harm higher ones such as humans, do not act for the benefit of the lower. Even if an action would harm some animals, if it would benefit humans and the like, then act for the humans’ benefit. The same principle applies with regard to ordinary people and practitioners of Dharma, and among practitioners, with regard to shravakas and bodhisattvas.

3. Consideration of the number of beings
If many beings would be helped and few harmed, you should act to benefit the many. But if many would be harmed and few helped, do not act. If the numbers and the help and harm would be equal, by relying on teachings of skillful methods of protection from harm, you will succeed in helping.

4. Consideration of this and future lives
If it would benefit others in both this life and those to come, you should act to benefit them, by all means. Whenever it would benefit neither life, you should not act. If it would help in this life but harm in future ones, do not act. Even if it would harm in this life, if it would help in the next, being skillful with methods to protect this life from harm you should act to benefit the next.

Actually, five: male, female, intersexed people (this is modern name for hermaphrodites); people with same sex orientation, and congenitally-sterile people.

Most transgendered women would be considered eunuchs, from a classical Buddhist point of view. Since all of these gender definitions are defined because of criteria for entering the Sangha, women are left out of it, hence included in same sex orientation in general. However, we could consider transgendered men eunuchs as well. The other two kinds of paṇḍakas, voyeurs and people who are only sexual active with the phases of the moon are not in consideration here.

Both. There are no "lay vows" in Buddhadharma. This idea is a misconception borrowed from Christianity. From an Abhidharma point of view, and Vinaya, you can certainly be refuge holder, but you cannot receive the vows, even if you undergo the pratimokṣa vow ceremony, other than as an aspiration.

There is no such thing as an "otherwise straight" child. Generally speaking, gender differentiation, in Tibetan Medicine and Ayurveda, occurs about three weeks after conception, though it can be changed in the third week of pregnancy.

If you are gay, you were born that way, according to Tibetan Medicine. So, nothing to really get bothered about. People who issue moral judgements about gender preferences, including the desire to change genders, simply have no idea what the facts are beneath such wishes and seem to have this idea that if you are a miserable in a male body, you should not seek to change this.

In Tibetan Medicine it is considered to be primarily the conduct of the mother, but also whether the amount of reproductive fluid is even. In other words:

"More semen, a boy will be born; more menstrum, a girl will be born. Equal amounts, apart from the divisions of ambiguous gender, cause the birth of twins; incompatible birth location; physical deformity, these are births caused by harmful impurities.

At the time of conception when the father’s sperm, the mother’s egg and the bardo consciousness are together, if there is more semen of the father, there will be birth as a boy; if there is more menstrum, i.e. the red element, a girl will be born a girl. If the semen and menstrum are even, a neuter, a hermaphrodite, or someone who changes gender will be born and at the time of the mer mer po stage of the mixing of semen and the red element twins will be born from a division into two or three sections because of being divided by wind. Also each section will have a some greater, lesser, or an equivalent amount of semen and menstrum,  producing births as above. "

Here ambiguous gender is a translation of the term paṇḍaka, and there are several types of paṇḍaka, with hermaphrodites and gay people included in this category.


In Abhidharma, excess affliction in general is the primary cause of a paṇḍaka. No cause is speculated upon in terms of conduct in past lives, it is simply stated that because of excess afflictions of both sexes (anger for lesbians), such people are incapable of holding pratimokṣa vows. But there is no sort of moral judgments about these people since there are many kinds of beings of ambiguous gender, like nāgas and so on.

I feel that as a community committed to creating an enlightened society, we deserve something better than business as usual.

Hopefully, it’s not too late to reverse this trend.  For instance, the Board could be proactive and invite a few small groups of people with differing views to propose ideas for how we can go forward – ways that include everyone in the community and that provide accountability for all that has happened.  If the Board could then make it their priority for 2020 to start to implement some of these plans … that, in my opinion, would be very wise.”

I guess over the years I've become pretty conservative on some social issues. But US Conservatives is something else entirely. For me, classical conservative vs progressive is simply that -  emphasis on preserving what is traditional, established vs emphasis on changing, reforming and throwing away. Any thinking person needs to look at matters on a case-by-case basis, but there is still bound to be an a priori bias towards conserving or changing.

Malcolm wrote:
This is ridiculously simplistic. The short and fast version is the conservatives want conserve their class privilege, which are the means by which they have attained wealth and power. This attitude begins right with person considered the founder of the modern conservatism, Burke. While lounging (or playing golf) in saccharine paternalism which pretends to a concern for others, conservatives in general simply want to make sure that they get to keep the benefits of their class privileges, which they did not earn for themselves, but came into on the backs of others.

Progressives seek to make sure that in a society were there is an enormous disparity between people in terms of class and privilege, those who have an outsized amount of power due to their wealth and power do not deprive those who lack wealth and privilege (most of us) of our basic rights, and seek policies to make sure that no one secures wealth and privilege through exploiting others. This may involve wealth redistribution from rich to the poor; whereas conservative policies seek to redistribute wealth from the poor to the rich.

In modern times, in so called first world countries, this is most crucially felt at the environmental level, where the those who have wealth and power live in regions that are relatively unpolluted, whereas the poor and powerless are forced to live in toxic environments.

At this phase of the game, progressives want to save the environment, whereas, over the last 20 years or so, conservatives have abandoned all sense and gone full tilt climate denialism, not because they really believe there is no problem, but because it is inconvenient for their accumulation of wealth and power.

Whatever form it takes, it's a toss-up whether it is better to have people as titular rulers who are there because of past  generations of warmongering and corruption, and those who are there because of current warmongering and corruption.

Suggestion 1:
Maybe we could persuade Netflix to buy the Windsor franchise and turn the whole shebang into a hybrid form of reality tv series:

'I''m a Royalty, Get me Out of Big Brother's Island' ?

Suggestion 2:
As this lot are Germans, we could arrange a rota system of royals from different nationalities to have a bash at it for a decade or so.

Suggestion 3:
Let descendants of previous relevant monarchs loose in an annual Royal 'It's a Knockout' series and give each winner a year.
At the moment, I'd put money on the Athelstan clan, even though they did fail to claim back Long Island recently.

It may. It might also help to allow for a number of diverging stories, which, diverge though they do, nevertheless all hit the crucial spot -- it may be simpler to achieve since it does not call for a need to agree upon what is fact and what is not.

These conflicts will probably subside "on their own" as religious traditions begin to really understand that the biggest threat is not another group of religious freaks in the town, but the increasingly prevalent hedonism and materialism.

In general, from the perspective of Dzogchen teachings, there are two kinds of persons: people who are inclined towards perceptual objects, and people who are inclined towards the self-appearance of vidyā. Teachings like semzins, tummo, chulen, etc., are oriented towards the former, and trekcho and thogal are oriented towards the latter.

In the section I mentioned, the progression is recognition, trust, and decisiveness. The Sound Tantra relates:

The recognition of one's own state is encountered with trust, 
Decisiveness establishes one in confidence.

This is just a very concise summary of the basic principles of Dzogchen teachings that are reinforced by the Three Phrases and so on.

These days, practicing śamatha accompanied with Dzogchen view is sometimes referred to as trekcho, but it is not really trekcho. Trekcho cannot arise out of śamatha. As The Tantra Without Syllables states:

Though the nature of vidyā pervades all,
the dharmakāya is encountered in the intimate instructions.

While it is certainly the case that practicing śamatha or mantra recitation (they are equivalent) with a Dzogchen view is beneficial, it is not the actual path of Dzogchen.

You'll be interested in hearing Alan Wallace's perspective on this. He also explores the roles of the dhyanis and the levels of shamatha practice.

It's not that the dhyanis are absent, it's that the yogic direct cognitions' perceptions taught in Tibetan Buddhism need not rely on perfect dhyani absorbtion as a prerequisite. The nature of mind including but *beyond* the vipassana topics off sutra is pointed out and so one can have those direct valid cognitions,  with or without the stability of stable dhyani or shamatha. (Although it will obviously help)

Alan Wallace will do a much better job at explaining this than my attempt above

Johnny Dangerous said:
He seems to be a big advocate of achieving Shamatha/the first Jhana, or coming close at least -including in a Dzogchen context. That's my understanding at least, mainly because it makes so many other things possible. The gist I got is that because achieving Shamatha makes for stable and clear vipaysana, and vipaysana is what guards one's practice of contemplation/nonmeditation from "backsliding". So according to my understanding of what he's teaching, you can - and people do - cut through to pristine awareness without achieving shamatha, but maintaining ad familiiarizing is far more likely with stable shamatha.

Malcolm wrote:
In dzogchen teachings one is using many different methods to discover natural concentration. Discovering shamatha is relatively simple when you use the approaches taught in the dzogchen tantras, rather than relying on the gradual method introduced by Kamalshila.

Rigpa is knowledge of your own state, when you have it, you never lose it, even if you are distracted.

One point where I really disagree with Wallace is his idea that trekcho is Dzogchen shamatha. I really dispute this notion.

The fact remains that in the contemporary Bönpo canon can be found some of the most important Buddhist texts, albeit with different titles, and even the iconography of Shenrab Miwoche emulates that of Buddha Śakyamuni. There may originally have been valid reasons for this work of transformation and adaptation of Buddhist elements, perhaps for the very preservation of authentic Bön teachings, but this principle was soon forgotten and the importance of the original traditions was neglected in favour of the philosophical teachings derived from Buddhism. It was probably at this juncture that the original Bön was classified as "Bön of Cause," that is as inferior to or preliminary to the "Bön of Fruit," and the authentic principles of the ancient Bön culture were misconstrued and almost excised by the protagonists of official Bön."

If people structured their thinking to slot parts of narratives into these different categories, then this would go a along way towards eliminating sectarian conflicts.

shagrath said:
That is great thought. I agree with you 100%. Just like historicity of e.g. christianity or judaism. Faithful can say outrageous things from Bible, and then comes historian  Bart Ehrman and slaps them with facts.

Two things come in mind:
1. Do you think that learning history is detrimental for dzogchen practice? Does one can go further into practice not caring about it?
2. What authors would you recommend for scientific approach to history of bön, dzogchen, nyingma, mahamudra, tibetan culture, etc?

Malcolm wrote:
I think the myths and legends found in Buddhism and Bon are important. They lend a sense of place and tradition. But when it comes to making truth claims on the basis of these myths and legends, this is where the trouble begins. For example, Virupa lived in the late 9th century. It is claimed he stopped the sun for three days while he and his two companions were on a drinking spree. You'd think that such a major astronomical event would be recorded somewhere in the world...but it isn't. Ergo, legend.

But when we find evidence in Indian treatises refuting Śṛī Simha by name, we have to conclude  Śṛī Simha was at the head of a genuine movement within Indian Buddhism in the mid-8th century called in Tibet, "rdzogs chen," and that whether one wants to accept the traditional accounts as facts or not, no one can deny the existence of Śṛī Simha nor can they deny he was the teacher of Vairocana. One can certainly debate what Dzogchen might have constituted at this early period, but we cannot deny that what took shape in Tibet as "rdzogs chen" is grounded in Indian Vajrayāna of the mid-8th century.  The contemporary record of Bonpo documents from the same period (eighth century) however, do not reveal any teachings even remotely resembling Buddhism, let alone rdzogs chen. The conclusion most students of history will then draw is that the Bonpos borrowed and adapted much Buddhist material to their own set of  cultural narratives, much as Taoists in China borrowed and adapted much Buddhism to their own cultural narratives.

This does not mean that Buddhists did not borrow Bonpo innovations in Dzogchen. As I point out in the intro to my forth-coming translation of the Blazing Lamp Tantra and its commentary, the scheme of six lamps is utterly absent from any Nyingma tantras in the Nyingma rgyud 'bum (for example, the term dkar 'jam rtsa is absent, etc.). On the Buddhist side of things, the six lamps seem first to appear in Longchenpa's Lama Yang thig and Zab mo yang thig in a set of texts called snyan brgyud. Since we know that there was interaction between Buddhists and Bonpos, especially between Nyingmapas and Bonpos, and since we know that Zhang Zhung Snyan Brgyud was written down after the seventeen tantras were revealed, but before Longchenpa, and given that the six lamps form a major part of that ZZNG textual cycle, the appearance of a similar list (though not precisely identical in all details) in Longchenpa's oeuvre bearing the title "snyan brgyud" leads one to speculate that Buddhists borrowed the scheme of six lamps from ZZNG and modified it to suit themselves. However, it is notable that in the Seven Treasures, there is no presentation at all of six lamps, only four. At present, the schemes of four and six lamps are very standard in various Buddhist Dzogchen curriculums. The scheme of six lamps earned its Buddhist canonicity from Longchenpa and also from the 15th century Zhitro cycle of Karma Lingpa.

If so then does this mean that the teacher-student emphasis in Tibetan Buddhism is losing is rightful purpose in the Buddhist world, where it would be a safer approach for Tibetan Buddhists to develop some degree of self-reliance on their own learning from texts in addition to relying on teachers when it comes to the Sutrayana component of Tibetan Buddhism?

Generally, the same thing as in Hināyāna, defined by place, time, partner, and orifice (the latter seems to be basically an issue of hygiene).

Monastics are forbidden all sexual conduct in any place, at any time, with any partner, or any orifice; lay people are forbidden sexual conduct with the spouses of others, minors, those under guardianship, etc., fellatio, cunnilingus, and sodomy are general forbidden.

Time means sexual conduct is generally forbidden during the day; place means in public or in shrines, etc.

Yes, this is his idea. I don't really share his opinion. When you compare them to say Vairocana's translations of the five early lungs -- the former betray a smoothness of composition that one really does not find in orally transmitted texts.

Regardless of origin, I think that many Bon teachings are valid Buddhadharma, even if I do not buy their historical narrative, but then, I don't necessarilyu buy all Buddhist historical narrative, like the Kālacakra dates for Buddha's lifetime. The study of Bon literature is absolutely vital to understanding Tibetan culture. There are so many useful and interesting things that Bon texts have to share.

I am sympathetic with their story, and am happy to admit they have long suffered oppression in the hands of Buddhists.

Well, frankly, you need to read the Old Tibetan documents and read what they have to say about Shenrab, actual rituals that address Shenrab and so on.

Their conclusions including Samten Karmay's, are pretty much the same as mine.

It is quite clear that, Shenrab has been subject to extensive reshaping from shaman to cosmic world teacher at the hands of the creative writing of Bonpos, beginning with Shenchen Luga. It is not an exaggeration to say that Bon as we know it today is largely his invention.

Of course, Sṛī Siṃha, etc., have also been subject to creative story-telling at the hands of Tibetans. It is simply that we have real third-party evidence of all these Indian figures, Garab Dorje included, and really none at all for these Bonpo figures.

In his second birth he was born in a northern buddhafield called “Movement of the Wind” as the son of a householder named Excellent Generosity and his wife, Generosity of Supreme Virtue. The town was named Ox-tailed. The son’s name was Rosary of Gems. When he reached 25 years of age, he went to a cave on the eastern side of that continent called Gathering of the Ḍākinīs and sat in the presence of a perfect buddha called Wheel of Excellent Conduct. Having offered a silk scarf and prostrations, he listened carefully to the Dharma. He then passed away.

Again, in place called “Island that Intoxicates with Bliss,” he was born to a man named Light of Lightening and a women named Beauty. The town was called “Holding the Sky” and his name was Generous Hand. At that time, for five years he heard the Dharma from a teacher called Virtuous Wisdom.

In order to tame the the confusion of ignorance, the root of samsara, at Wolmo Lungring in the land of Zhang Zhung the hidden treasure of compassion arrived in the form of Shenrab Miwoche [gshen rab mi bo che, i.e. the supreme one of the Shen clan, the greatest of men]. The hidden treasure was concealed in a single intention by all the Tathāgatas in the mind of Shenrab, and he taught the nine vehicles of Bon.

Malcolm wrote:
So he also does not really accept the idea that Shenrab was born outside the region of the Himalayas.

According to whom I wonder. Certainly there are zero contemporary records that can support this claim. And how would this happen, since ZZNG was a single lineage teaching, according to the claims of ZZNG itself until quite late, and the rest of Bon Dzogchen are all termas dating from the 11th century onward. Certainly Bonpos claim Vairocana as one of their own, but it does not really make much sense, honestly.

Malcolm wrote:
Tonpa Shenrab mostly certainly was imagined to have visited the region we presently refer to as Tibet, regardless of what it was called in the past. Of course, Namkhai Norbu RInpoche presents significant evidence that Shenrab was in fact not a foreign teacher at all, but was from a native clan located in what was once termed Zhang Zhung, and now is referred to as Western Tibet.

Moreover, clan histories such as that of Lce clan in Mangyul, point to a cultural origin in "Tazig" as well. The Khon very likely were a part of this eastern movement of Iranian-speaking people into Tibet as well, since their clan history and the clan history of the Lce resemble each other strongly, but differ on certain points as well. It is possible that that the six brothers who mentioned in the origin of the lCe clan and the three brothers mentioned in the origin of the Khon clan are based on the notion of the Amesha Spenta emanations of Ahura Mazda.

You seem to be joking here.
Someone with your amount of expertise should know that the origins of Dzogchen were non-scriptual, transmitted at the beginning with mind-to-mind only transmissions, and later on by oral transmission.
Just as even the later teachings of Shakyamuni were note written down (but memorized) for hundreds of years.
Writing down began much-much-much later down the line (ie. lineage)
So scriptural evidence has exactly zero evidence regarding the origins of Dzogchen.

Malcolm wrote:
The so called rgyal dgongs rgyud is not a mind to mind transmission. Garab Dorje was a Buddha, therefore he had all three kāyas: Samantabhadra is a name for his mind, just as Vajrasattva is a name for his speech. As for the 6.4 million slokas of Dzogchen tantras, these were written down by Mañjuśṛīmitra and divided into the three series, according to the lo rgyus chen mo, and then divided into the four cycles by Sṛī Simha, which were then given to Jñānasūtra and Vimalamitra, etc. The transmission for these texts however was given in symbols, rather than extensive discourses, hence the symbolic vidyādhara lineage. Finally, Vimalamitra, according the lo rgyus chen mo, translated these texts and gave them to  Tingzin Zangpo (who hid them in Zhva Gonpa), initiating the so called aural lineage of esteemed persons. However, this aural lineage was accompanied by texts from the beginning, since according to tradition, Vimalamitra translated many Dzogchen tantras into Tibetan, some where hidden as treasures, and others, like the thirteen later lungs, were part of the bka' ma tradition. Naturally, the historical accounts given in the so called sems sde histories and klong sde histories are represent an earlier tradition of Dzogchen teachings than the lo rgyus chen mo, and are significantly different form the lo rgyus chen mo in terms of the details they present. We have independent confirmation of the existence of Sṛī Simha, etc., in the form of an Indian polemical treatise, which dates from the late 10th century and was authored by Mañjuśṛīkīrti, that refutes the views of Sṛī Simha by name and the movement he presented. So one thing we can be quite confident about is that there was a guy name Sṛī Simha, he was a student of Mañjuśṛīmitra, he taught a radical doctrine whereby he asserted only the completion stage was necessary. Finally, we can also be certain that there was a Tibetan named Bagor Vairocana, who was the first person to translated Dzogchen texts in Tibetan, and we can also be certain that Sṛī Simha was a contemporary of Trisong Detsen. Before this period, it is extremely unlikely there was anything remotely like the teaching of the Great Perfection in Tibet. Dzogchen is wholly an Indian-inspired Vajrayāna movement. There is really no evidence that suggests otherwise.

The Bon forum was suspended because members of the board began to complain to the staff about claims certain Bonpos were making about Śākyamuni Buddha, as well as the origins of the Great Perfection, and it was decided at the time by the staff that the competing historical narratives of Buddhadharma and Bon did not fit well together. Also people could not understand why a nonBuddhist religion was being allowed space on a Buddhist board. Therefore, the forum was suspended.

There were a lot of issues at E-Sangha -- competing narratives about the nature of Buddhadharma led to three way split-- Theravadins went their own way with Dhammawheel, David provided this space for Mahāyānis here, and the Zen folks went their separate way. Because Bon is a naturalized Tibetan form of Mahāyāna Buddhism (like all the other Tibetan Buddhist schools), whether they want to admit this or not, I guess David decided that they deserved a place here too.

As there are few Theravadins here, and few Zen people to complain about Bon, the Bon forum has persisted largely in the form of one person making frequent posts, as well as a couple of other folks with Bonpo connections who post infrequently.

Incidentally, the information this article provides for Norbu Rinpoche's dates for the birth of Tonpa Shenrab are wrong. The correct date is 1917 BCE (see page 158, Drung, Deu and Bon ), not 3927 BCE. Norbu marks this date as the beginning of Tibetan history, and it has been widely adopted by Tibetan nationalists. Norbu's Rinpoche's work in this area, by his own admission, was driven by nationalist sentiment and a desire to provide Tibetans with an ancient history on equal footing with Persia, India, and China.

Some of his theories, such as the one that writing existed in Tibet prior to the 7th century, for example, lack convincing evidence. All Tibetan scripts descend from Gupta era scripts, including Zhang zhung dmar, and while Tonmi Sambhota himself may be a legendary personage, it is pretty clear there was no official writing system in Tibet prior to the 7th century.

The myths of the twelve Teachers of Dzogchen are inspiring, but it is mythology, and quite late, textually speaking, originating from the treasure cache of Zhangton Tashi Dorje, which was revealed circa 1118, and are quite specific to Dzogchen man ngag sde. The detailed account of these twelve teachers are found in the lo rgyus chen mo, composed by Zhangton. He explains too why the twelve teachers are the twelve teachers, and why Śākyamuni is included among them, even though the latter never actually taught Dzogchen directly in this world. The reason is as follows. The conventional account of a Buddha's life is that they perform twelve deeds. All Buddhas do this. But the twelve teachers are unique in that they perform 108 deeds: thirty-six for the body, speech, and mind of the dharmakāya; thirty-six for the body, speech, and mind of the sambhogakāya, and thirty-six for the body, speech, and mind of the nirmanakāya. So these twelve teachers are considered unique by virtue of their 108 deeds, and are unlike all other buddhas for this reason. The inner meaning of this is pretty clear: 12 deeds X nine yānas.

At this time, any delegation sent to Iraq would be dedicated to discussing how to best recommit to our strategic partnership—not to discuss troop withdrawal, but our right, appropriate force posture in the Middle East. Today, a NATO delegation is at the State Department to discuss increasing NATO’s role in Iraq, in line with the President’s desire for burden sharing in all of our collective defense efforts.

Malcolm wrote:
No, that is not the controversy. Most Buddhist gurus are ordinary people, who have expertise in certain ritual systems and the conferral of certain kinds of teachings.

Fundamental to this system is pure vision. Pure vision is from our side. We are supposed to understand that the guru from whom we receive empowerment is same as the buddhas of the three times. If we do not have this idea, it is held, than we cannot benefit from their teaching. As practitioners on the path, we are supposed to understand the universe and all the beings in it as members of the same mandala, sublime deities, buddhas; not hell beings, pretas, etc. We exercise our pure perception by practicing deity yoga and guru yoga. When we realize that everything has never been different than the state of buddhahood, and that everything has always been the state of buddhahood from the very beginning, this realization is called mahāmudra, the great symbol; or mahāsandhi, the great perfection.

The controversy exists because there are teachings which indicate that prospective students need to be vetted on the basis of their intelligence, devotion, and lack of concepts. Likewise, gurus are vetted on the basis of their education, expertise, and personal qualities, but not their ultimate realization—how can any normal person perceive that?

Plainly put, sometimes qualified gurus pick unqualified students, and this causes problems. Likewise, qualified students sometimes pick unqualified gurus. Thus, some in the Sogyal scandal think Sogyal was an unqualified guru. Others think that Sogyal chose unqualified students, or students who broke their samaya. Frankly, from a traditional point of view, there is no way one can argue that those letter-writing students did not injure their samaya when they composed their letter, since they all received empowerments from and with Sogyal. The whole point of samaya vows is to maintain the integrity of the Vajrayāna Sangha. The very first samaya vow is that one should not harshly criticize one's guru. This is even worse than criticizing the Buddha himself. The second one is that one should not cause conflict with vajra siblings.

Vajrayāna disciples are expected to regard everything their guru does as sacred, unless it directly violates Dharma ethics. Hitting a disciple with the intention to benefit them is well within that range. It is not acceptable in our culture, but it is quite acceptable in Tibetan culture. Having multiple sexual partners (if unmarried) is fine, so is being a sybarite.

What is not acceptable is taking life, taking what is not given, speaking with intent to deceive, and sexual misconduct, the four basis of training. Of course, excluding sex crimes, these four can also be given a pass if performed with bodhicitta motivation.

Anyone can leave the company of a given guru with or without cause, but if someone has taken samaya vows with someone who is qualified to give them, then one should never harshly criticize that person.

When it comes to Dharma ethics, we in the West tend to treat these as legal frameworks, but they are not. If anything, the Rigpa affair points to the deficit in corporate-style Buddhism; where feeder programs are created in order to introduce people into the path; who are in turn vetted for their actual interest in higher teachings and so on. Most of the people in Rigpa are not Vajrayāna students, just as most of the people in Shambhala Centers are not Vajrayāna students. So if these people think that Sogyal and Mukpo suck, there is no problem. But it becomes a problem when one enters into a samaya relationship.

The whole system of Vajrayāna is based on the unassailable authority of the guru. So, caveat emptor.

Well, when there is smoke on a hill, there is generally fire. I am not defending Sogyal's temperament, I am defending his student's right to regard him however they wish. Also, I have had time and opportunity to speak with people who both have left Sogyal in tremendous disappointment, and people who never experienced anything from him other than kindness, and people in between, whose experience of him was mixed. I have also seen that certain people have sought to use the Sogyal affair to smear Vajrayāna in general, namely a certain people who know nothing about our tradition. This bugs me.

I am not going to criticize those who felt they had to bring him down, not even Mary Finnegan, but neither am I going to participate in outright condemnation of Sogyal either. He was not my teacher, I never met him, and apart from criticisms of him in the press, I have no personal knowledge of the goings on in Rigpa; other than having heard some of the other side of the story which up till now, has been met with derision and accusations of cult brainwashing.

I have no problem with people who have no devotion towards Sogyal. I also have no problem with those who remain devoted to him. It just isn't any of my business.

Tibet was not like that, as you know. Tibet had no legal system to speak of. No courts, no jails, just aristocrats with their soldiers meting out punishments based on local custom and personal capriciousness. The Tibetan establishment is still based on this idea.

If Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodo says Y is the tulku of X, that is it. There is no council that recognizes tulkus. It is all based on the word of a man.

For example, Dilgo Khyentse's family was the wealthiest family in the Derge region. Of course, this does not reflect poorly on Dilgo Khyentse, but since his family was the number 1 sponsor of Khyentse Wangpo, they had a significant say in the disposition of the Khyentse Ladrang's estate after his death. This is one of the reasons why there was significant tension between adherents of Loter Wangpo's Khyentse tulku, and the adherents of Chokyi Lodo, etc., who preferred him for various reasons, probably because Loter Wangpo was not from Kham, but rather, Tsang, and ceding the Khyentse Ladrang would have been ceding enormous wealth to someone who has not a Khampa.

I think the situation on the ground is considerably more complicated than this idea that Buddha taught in Prakrit, and then this was translated later into Sanskrit. Clearly no one was concerned to preserve the Buddha's actual words in the dialect in which the Buddha actually taught, since there are too many dialects in which he taught in various places in Central India.

If only the Democrats had adapted to the changing economic circumstances to address the tsunami that was hitting labor back in the 70s and 80s

Malcolm wrote:
The Democrats lost precisely because they were backing the unions, which were wholly undermined by GOP "right to work" laws aimed at undermining unions. This was deliberate, since the GOP understood that unions were the main constituency of the Democrats:

"By weakening the relationship between Democrats and unions, we anticipate that RTW laws will drive state policy—including, but not restricted to labor policies—in a rightward direction. We hypothesize that this will be a product of the direct electoral effects of RTW laws: by favoring the election of GOP candidates to state legislatures and governorships, states with RTW laws in place will be more likely to have partially or fully Republican- controlled governments. But RTW laws should also move policy to the right even when states are fully or partially controlled by Democrats. With labor unions a less central member of the Democratic party coalition, we expect that Democrats will have less reason to pursue the left-leaning economic policies favored by labor unions (e.g. Bawn et al. (2012)). And to the extent that RTW laws make it harder for working class state legislative candidates to win office, that should also move state policy to the right."

And:


"The anti-tax political activist Grover Norquist recently declared that while President Trump may be historically unpopular, the GOP could still “win big” in 2020. The secret to the Republican party’s long-term success, Norquist argued, involved state-level initiatives to weaken the power of labor unions. As Norquist explained it, if union reforms cutting the power of labor unions to recruit and retain members—like RTW laws—“are enacted in a dozen more states, the modern Democratic Party will cease to be a competitive power in American politics.” A weaker labor movement, Norquist reasoned, would not just have economic consequences. It would also have significant political repercussions, meaning that Democrats would have substantially less of a grassroots presence on the ground during elections and less money to invest in politics."

And:

"Working class candidates—politicians most likely to be backed by the labor movement—are less likely to hold office in states fol- lowing the passage of RTW laws. State policy as a whole, moreover, moved sharply to the ideological right in RTW states following the passage of those laws."


https://businessinnovation.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/rtw-laws-manuscript_oct2017.pdf

Ergo, what we need in the USA is a broad, renewed labor movement, and Bernie Sanders is the only person who can lead this movement. The reason the voice of the working class in America has been muted has everything to do with GOP successes in state legislatures, and nothing at all to do with some imagined abandonment of the working class by left-wing intelligentsia.

Tantras do not equal texts. There are of course textual artifacts that are called "tantras," but that is not really what a tantra is in the Vajrayāna tradition.

What we are referring to as a "tantra" when we are talking about a text artifact is a practice manual. But that is a very limited scope.

Regardless of what you and others may think, Khenchen Namdrol is one of the best and brightest teachers of his generation. He is a real bodhisattva.

It somewhat depends on what you mean by "tantric," an imprecise term at best. The earliest texts that we have which involve conferring empowerments and advocating mantra recitation, fire offerings, and so on as paths to buddhahood seem to have emerged in early 7th century in South India, near Nagārjunakota, and other places, such as the Swat Valley, and were first promulgated outside of India to Khotan in Central Asia, Java, etc., and China. By 800 CE, all the formative material which characterizes later Vajrayāna teachings were firmly established traditions in India and elsewhere, and had been adopted into the Monastic Universities. The Siddha tradition also seems to have emerged in the mid 8th century, circa 750 CE. However, most of what we know about the origin of Vajrayāna is in second-hand sources, due to the destruction of great monasteries and their libraries at end of the 12th century.

"It is now clear that none of the existing Buddhist collections of early Indian scriptures—not the Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese, nor even the Gandhari—“can be privileged as the most authentic or original words of the Buddha.”

And:

"Pali tradition reports that Buddhist monks in the Theravada tradition started writing down texts in about the first century B.C.E. The manuscript record in Pali, however, doesn’t begin until about 800 C.E. But the Gandhari manuscripts date from as early as the first century B.C.E. If monks were writing in one part of India, they could likely have been writing in other parts of India as well—so this would seem to add credence to the Pali claims."

I believe it was the Sutra in 42 Sections.
In the year of 67 C.E., at the special invitation by Emperor Ming of the
Later Han Dynasty, two Indian Buddhist masters from India,
Kashyapa-matanga and Gobharana, arrived at Luoyang (洛陽), China.
Five years before their arrival, in 62 C.E., Emperor Ming had dreamed
that a golden man flew into his palace. The next day he consulted his
advisor who told the emperor that must be the sage Buddha. In 64 C.E.
a delegation was sent to India to seek the Buddhadharma.

Kashyapa-matanga and Gobharana came with white horses, bearing
precious sutras, Buddha statues, and relics. The emperor built them a
monastery - the very first Buddhist monastery in all of China, aptly
named The White Horse Monastery (白馬寺). There they undertook the
great task of translating The Sutra of Forty-Two Chapters - the first
Buddhist text translated into the Chinese language.

In the Sutra there are aspects of Theravada and Mahayana; expedient
means and ultimate reality; gradual cultivation and sudden
enlightenment. Even more importantly, all of the various teachings in
the Sutra of Forty-Two Chapters are ultimately one single vehicle
pointing to one single goal – enlightenment.

Entities appear, and are then given conventional designations. We also do not create sentience. From the point of view of Buddhadharma, a given stream of consciousness has no start point, no creator. I also stated that corporations were merely legal persons; but as legal persons they are given rights, have agency, and so on.

For example one of the Four Phurbas in Vajrakilaya is the primordial wisdom phurba which, as I understand, is the state of Dzogchen. So how is one supposed to actually practise such a sadhana if the empowerment for that practice does not include direct introduction? I mean, the empowerment is the foundation for any practice no?

Malcolm wrote:
The fourth empowerment common to gsar ma and snying ma is a kind of introduction, but it is not sufficient for practicing Dzogchen, so to answer your question directly, the empowerment is not foundation for any practice. One also needs to also have further introductions and liberating instructions. And there are further introductions one will need beyond that. For example, the Meteoric Razor (gnam lcags spu gri) Vajrakilaya tradition of Dudjom Lingpa, even after one has received the empowerment in a proper way, it is assumed one will have practiced in some detail the preliminaries, creation and completion stage, then the special Dzogchen preliminaries. Nevertheless, one needs specific further introductions in order to practice the main practices of Dzogchen.

Likewise, in the Jonang tradition, merely receiving the outer four empowerments is not sufficient for practicing the six limb yoga; or in Lamdre, merely receiving the cause empowerment, which has all four empowerments, is not sufficient for practicing the pratices associated with the three inner empowerments, one needs also the path empowerment and the blessing empowerment of Vajrayogini/Nairatma.

Nicholas Weeks said:
Thus conservatives in temperament have a more realistic, even grim view of human potential.

Malcolm wrote:
Conservative ideologies are not consistent with transcendent dharma, since they take selfishness as the a priori state of sentient beings. As John Kenneth Galbraith puts it, "The modern conservative is engaged in one of man's oldest exercises in moral philosophy; that is, the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness."

But Buddhadharma does not assert that an afflicted state is the original state of sentient beings; quit the contrary, Buddhadharma holds, unlike conservatism, that afflictions are not innate. Conservatism holds generally that human beings are not perfectible. Buddhadharma on the other hand maintains that human beings are inherently perfectible, this is the consquence of holding that human beings are not inherently afflicted. Buddhadharma has never expressed skepticism of state-sponsored welfare enterprises, as a quick read of Nāgārjuna's Ratnavali reveals, nor does it hold kingship in particularly high esteem, as Āryadeva's satirical presentation of royal paternity shows. Unlike Kirk, who maintains that class comes from natural order and inequality is necessary; Buddha himself directly negated the burgeoning caste system in India, while at the same time pointing out that class, beauty, health, fame, and other mundane desiderata were a function of one's positive or negative karma. However, the Buddha also negated that birth into this or that station in life was in any way a meaningful indicator of the moral and social worth of a person. Modern conservatives, echoing the old Calvinist doctrine, measure moral worth in terms of wealth, power, and status, and encourage the fable that ability to achieve wealth, power, and status results from a person's intrinsic ability, rather than a set of social conditions and luck, over which none of us have much, if any control.

There is no case that can be advanced that Buddhadharma can be reconciled with conservatism, whether of Burkean kind or the modern conservative trend. Conservatism is not egalitarian; it concerns itself principally with the preservation of established orders, no matter that they are founded on inequality and oppression. It is a species of self-interested moral fatalism. As such, it is utterly incompatible with Buddhadharma. We can see this within Buddhadharma itself —— conservative movements in Buddha inevitably fail because conservatism is fundamentally at odds with the radical and transformational nature of Buddhadharma's vision of a perfectible humanity. In a conservative Buddhadharma, one cannot have a Guru Rinpoche or a Dudjom Lingpa, neither a Bodhidharma nor a Huineng. A conservative Buddhadharma is just a kind of phariseeism, the establishment of a political class in religious garb, with goals divorced from the very principles those robes are supposed to represent. From the point of view of Buddhadharma, there no daylight between conservatives, the pharisees, and the brahmins.

The conservative view of human potential is utterly at odds with Buddhadharma, in toto.

There’s no relationship with any particular religion. Even without religion, even as nonbelievers, we have the capacity to promote these things." Not only is it the case that the US Govt. is the first national Govt. in human history where the transfer of power from one leader to another was not occasioned by death or violence, it is the first purely secular state. We ought to keep it that way.

Until 1956, the official motto of the United States was "E pluribus unum;" however, since 1956, it has been "In God we trust." The latter is a clear violation of the establishment clause, should be removed, and our old motto reinstated.

As to the argument that we are a Christian nation, the Treaty of Tripoli stipulates that, "As the Government of the United States of America is not, in any sense, founded on the Christian religion; as it has in itself no character of enmity against the laws, religion, or tranquility, of Mussulmen (Muslims); and as the said States never entered into any war or act of hostility against any Mahometan (Mohammedan) nation, it is declared by the parties that no pretext arising from religious opinions shall ever produce an interruption of the harmony existing between the two countries."

Russel Kirk's point of view is grounded not only in the conservatism of Adams and Hamilton, it is also grounded in the pernicious proto-liberatarianism of the slaveholder and political theorist, John C. Calhoun. Indeed, Kirk's arguments against federalism are grounded in the same principles through which Calhoun defended slavery, and spend his life trying to weaken the sphere of power of the federal government (when it suited his interests to do so, much as modern day Republicans are quite happy to use regulatory capture when it suits them, but complain bitterly about it nevertheless).

Kirk's notions that we must believe in a transcendent order is nonsense; his belief that society requires classes to emphasize natural distinctions is fundamentally racist. He writes, "For the preservation of a healthy diversity in any civilization, there must survive orders and classes, differences in material condition, and many sorts of inequality." In the USA, race is class. White people on top; black and latin people below them, with native people at the bottom. His argument is an argument for permanent ghettoes and slums, absent a social safety net.

Why American conservatism failed
Fareed Zakaria
Jul 4, 2019

Today’s crisis of conservatism has produced surprisingly few books that try to understand what exactly has happened to the venerable creed. For decades, conservatism was a dominant ideology in the Western world, championed by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. Now, it has quietly collapsed. President Trump’s populism has taken over the Republican Party, and Brexit fever has consumed Britain’s Conservative leaders.

Into this muddle comes George F. Will’s “The Conservative Sensibility.” I have long admired Will, who embodies the ideal of thoughtful, learned conservatism. When I was in college, he was already a fixture of U.S. political and intellectual life — a columnist for The Post, a regular commentator on Sunday morning television and the author of several books. As the editor of an undergraduate publication, I summoned the courage to write to Will asking for an interview, to which he agreed. That was 35 years ago, and since then my admiration and respect have remained undimmed. Thus, I picked up “The Conservative Sensibility” with great anticipation.

The book, as one might expect, is deeply erudite, filled with examples from history and illuminating quotations from politicians and poets. Will has attempted to outline the basic features of his creed. American conservatism, Will announces, has almost nothing to do with European conservatism, “which is descended from, and often is still tainted by, throne-and-altar, blood-and-soil nostalgia, irrationality, and tribalism.” He paraphrases Thatcher in observing that “European nations were made by history, the United States was made by philosophy.” American conservatism, then, is a project that seeks to defend the original philosophy of the Founding Fathers: classical liberalism, which promotes limited government and the veneration of individual liberty.

The counterpoint to this tradition, Will argues, is progressivism, the philosophy articulated by Woodrow Wilson and most capably enacted by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Born during the industrialization of the country after the Civil War, progressivism sees society as requiring collective action undertaken by government, which can best enable individuals to flourish economically, politically and morally. This tradition, for Will, has eroded the ideals of the American founding, enervated the spirit of America and created a country that is less free, less self-reliant and poised for economic stagnation.

But the problem for Will and for modern conservatism is that, as progressivism rose in the 20th century, the United States became the most powerful, productive and dynamic nation in the world. Indeed, after the New Deal came the astonishing American boom of the 1950s and 1960s. After the Great Society came the information revolution, which the United States has dominated more than any other nation. The fact remains that in 2019, the United States is one of the most free, dynamic and innovative countries on the planet. If that is the result of a century of progressive policies, maybe we need more?

The fundamental flaw of modern conservatism is that it is unsure whether America today is a fallen republic or an astonishing success story. This confusion has produced a political crisis among conservatives, which might help explain the rise of Trump.

Ever since the 1930s, conservatives have been promising their flock the rollback of the progressive agenda. They have warned about the dangers of leaving the welfare state intact and pilloried conservative leaders for failing in this crucial task. Yet, despite the Reagan revolution, the Newt Gingrich revolution and the tea party revolution, the welfare state is still standing as strong as ever. Republicans dominate almost every arena of U.S. politics — and the state is bigger than ever. Should we chalk this up to incompetence? More likely, conservatives know that the public actually wants the welfare state and that a modern country could not function today under some libertarian fantasy experiment. Of course, they will never admit this.
In any case, the result is that conservative leaders left their base permanently aggrieved, feeling betrayed and distrustful of any new campaign promises. In recent years, as the fever grew, conservative voters became desperate for someone who had not played this game of bait-and-switch with them. And into this rage walked Trump, who easily toppled the old conservative establishment and rode the frustration with elites all the way to the White House.

Will has written a fascinating book. But at its heart is the same saga of a lost utopia that has crippled modern conservatism and damaged U.S. politics. Will describes himself as “an amiable, low-voltage atheist.” Well, then he surely knows that there never really was a Garden of Eden.

So if your army is one hundred people, and you all approve of an act of killing, the karmic result for you is multiplied by 100 times. See Pruden, Abidharmakośabhaṣyaṃ, pg. 649.

For example, while I indeed voted for Obama 2008, I did not approve of any of his military policies, etc., and thus, I did not vote for him in 2012. But unlike many other liberals in the US, I was never convinced that Obama was all that. But at least he is intelligent, well-educated, polite, and not a malignantly narcissistic, ignorant, womanizing, sexually-abusive racist (and very likely, a rapist as well), like the present occupant of the White House.

There are many such descriptions one can read in various places.

The basic idea is that every action has a result which must be experienced providing its cause has not been cut off either through rebirth into a realm where such negative results cannot come to fruition or the elimination of the karmic obscuration.

Theravadins have a diffent idea in so far as they understand some things to merely be a manifestation of conditions, such as plane crashes, etc., not necessarily tied to a specific act on one's part.

According to Sarvastivadin Abhidharma, no. Since both Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna are largely grounded in this system, the answer you will generally receive is that any and all results one experiences, including the creation and dissolution of the universe are all results of individual karma.

It's just a rude way to put it, from a Tibetan Buddhist point of view. It implies one's relationship with that guru has ceased. One's guru does not die, one's guru dissolves his or her continuum into the dharmadhātu, demonstrates parinirvana, and so on. But they never simply "die."  Now, as far as Ram Dass goes, I am sure he could care less what people call his death.

Queequeg said:
Is this rooted in Tibetan language or idioms? Would one refrain from saying any person died or just eminent people like one's guru? Is this directed at English speakers in particular whose ideas of "died" is culturally informed by a materialist view?

Malcolm wrote:
The words, "kill," "slay," "death," and so on, are all culturally inauspicious words in Tibetan. In particular, the word for death in Tibetan, 'chi ba, means "to be destroyed." Likewise, the word for body, "lus," means "left over." So we never refer to our guru's body as "lus," we refer to it as "sku," the honorific for body. This has nothing to do with Buddhism, since the word for lus and sku in Sanskrit is kāya. For example, we never call the body of our guru a corpse (phung po or ro). We call it a sku gdung, which means, literally, "body and bones," gdung being the honorific for bones, as sku is the honorific for body. All of this likely comes from pre-Buddhist usages for dealing with the remains of kings.

This is not aimed at speakers of other language groups.

When referring to enemies, animals, and so on, these words are not so fraught; but with family members, important people, one's gurus, etc., it is considered impolite to refer directly to their deaths as "death." So Tibetans use euphemisms. Likewise, if a member of a family dies, or one's guru, one observes a period of mourning which precludes the next new year's celebration, generally a celebration of good fortune. So for example, after ChNN passed away, I did not celebrate the Tibetan new year at all, etc. Tibetan concepts around death are complicated, combining Tibetan cultural assumptions with Buddhist assumptions. But they have very little to do with trying to forestall physicalist interpretations of the death process.

Brings up a question .... what about Europe?

I just know that HH. Chetsang Rinpoche discovered some Vajradakini cave in the USA and founded a nunnery near the place. The cave was and still is a holy grounds for native americans around there. But not sure if my info is correct, but more can be found in his biography.

Sonam Wangchug said:
He had quite a bit of obstacles in discovering the cave (someone slammed his hand in the car door) and had to descend dangerously down a rope with his injured hand. He said it was Local spirit/s making obstacles.

I believe there was also Sindhura found in that cave.

I also heard that the late Kunzang Dechen Lingpa described an important cave shaped like a Phurba? In VT I think he saw it in his dream.



Malcolm wrote:
The so called Vajrayoginī cave in the Wild River, in Bristol, VT. is right here: https://goo.gl/maps/Cve4gvc8mMw6UBFc8. It is a very popular swimming spot frequented by thousands of people every year in the summer.The bank from the road down to the river is quite steep, and the cave can only be entered by wading through the manmade pool in front of its entrance. I have been in this cave, which is located behind the waterfall in the picture, many times, and yes, this is the cave that HH Chetsang Rinpoche allegedly identified as a source of sindhura. The original source of this story is David Arndt. When asked about it, Kunzang Dechen Lingpa did not agree, and thought it was just an ordinary place with ordinary clay, not sindhura at all. David was very disappointed to hear this, and chooses still to advertise this location as a Vajrayogini place. For him and the Drigung faithful, it is such a place. For others, not so much.

As for the "cave" on Deer Leap Rock ( http://obscurevermont.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/dsc_0159_pe1.jpg ), KDL did not have a dream about it, he just thought there was a cave up there, and when Pema Wangdi and David went up to investigate, sure enough there was a rock overhang that might serve as a cave with some improvements. I was in Lincoln the day they reported discovering a cave up there, though did not walk up there myself, as I was busy attending KDL. KDL thought that if there was a cave up there, as he suspected, it would be a good place to do retreat, having spent many years as a wandering mendicant before finally settling down in Rangapara, Assam. Also, I was in the car with KDL when he first noticed the rock face and opined it might have a cave. It was a result of his yogi's eye, and not a dream, that led to the discovery of that cave. He never mentioned anything about phurpas in relationship to that cave in my hearing. But I was not with him 24/7/365.

As far as Lincoln, VT. itself goes, however, it is the first place in the US where Kalu Rinpoche had a place, and has hosted many lamas over the years, principally Kagyu and Nyingma Lamas. It is a very special town, one of the most impressive towns in VT, from the point of view of its views and location. Some places one can look right down the valley and see Lake Champlain. The mountain range behind  it has the appearance of a women lying on her side in repose, and Mt. Abe has the distinct shape of a breast. On eastern side of these mountains are a number of ski resorts, like Mad River Glen, etc. I am actually looking at Mt. Abe as I write this to you. So, sindhura or not, Lincoln VT. is a special place, where I have received many wonderful teachings from fantastic gurus, and that is really the main point.

For consistency, then, object of cognition in Malcolm statement has to be a mental representation.  But if that is the case, then what is understood ultimately cannot be accurate and cannot be a basis for explaining how Siddhas can have the ability to affect their physical objects such as leaving footprints on rocks.

Malcolm wrote:
No, the object of cognition is not "representation only," (vijñāptimatra) for it it were, there would be no difference between Cittamātra and general Madhyamaka.

I get a little tired of repeating myself, but here it goes again:

Because all entities can be perceived veridically,
it is found that all entities can be apprehended with two natures.
When some object that is perceived veridically, that is true. 
All [objects] perceived falsely are said to be relative truths.

Candra continues:

"The buddhas that know with correct wisdom the intrinsic nature of the two truths have taught that all external entities such as formations, sprouts, and so on, have two intrinsic natures. These [natures] are relative and ultimate.

This excludes your contention that what is being referred to are mental representations.

He continues:

The ultimate is the acquisition of the essential identity of the specific object of the wisdom (jñāna) that sees the truth, but is not established through its own nature. This is the first nature. The other is all the mental eyes of ordinary people that are obscured with opthalmia and cataracts, which find an existent self from the power of false perception. Whatever becomes the object of the perception of children,  such a nature is not intrinsically established. Therefore, the nature of all entities are apprehended in these two ways.

Frankly, the frustrating thing about you is that you don't do your homework, and don't seem to bother to educate yourself about these things. This is the main reason why I have no interest in your exercises in logic. It is a waste of time, for me, because your logic is not grounded in citation. Time and again, in order to even have a discussion, I define terms, which you consistently ignore, based on some personal criteria which is opaque at best. We have wasted the better part of thread supposedly devoted to Dzogchen to just running on the same hamster wheel. So am I out.

If you bother to try to answer my question directly instead of evading, you will notice that the object of cognition for a relative truth and an ultimate truth for a table can never be the same object until you drill down to the final parts that made up the object.

For the same reason, you will also notice that the object of cognition necessarily has to be a mental image rather than the object itself for a relative truth until you come to the final parts that made up the object.
I am using the concepts of sets.

One set is the set of all objects that are eternal, namely permanent and unchanging.  The other is the set of all objects that cannot be a continuum because they are annihilated.  The set that avoid the two extremes is merely that set for any object that don't fall into either of the two other sets.

Malcolm wrote:
As I said, it does not matter whether you use this noun or that noun. Your proposed set is just another extreme: neither existent and nonexistent.

Gomadevi, like Mandarava and Yeshe Tsogyal, is a realized historical personage. In her case, she is a realized Dzogchen master who attained the highest realization. Therefore, there can be no questioning the validity of her practice, especially given her association with Guhyajñāna.

Achi Chokyi Drolma, Sakya Pandita, Lonchenpa, Marpa, Mila, Gampopa, Karma Pakshi, etc. are realized historical personages, they all have guru sadhanas, etc.. There is no tantra, per se, that recommends Śakyamuni Buddha as a yidam or Bhaisajyaguru as a Yidam, but indeed, we have kriya tantra practices of these figures, which can be practiced as self-generations by those who have received HYT initiations. The procedures for this are very clearly explained in the tantras.

For all of these practices, precedent can be found in the tantras for the elaboration of their practices.  For those practices like Krodhakālī, one, she is a form of Vajravārāhi, whose practice is fully explained in mother tantras; 2) her sadhana was received from a ḍākinī in Oddiyāna by Mahāsiddha Virupa and transmitted to Tibet by Padampa Sangye, and so on.

But there are no practices involving mundane protectors like Indra, Vaiśravana, and so on, as yidams. And we know what HH Dalai Lama says about relying on mundane protectors as enlightened. He could not have been more clear.

Apart from moving, how could there be a mover?

Wayfarer said:
I can see the logic, but in everyday experience it is not hard to envisage an object that is at rest, that has been moving. A stone is thrown through the window, evidence of movement is provided by the breakage of the glass and the presence of the stone, which, although now at rest, was previously in motion. But then I suppose the question arises as to the sense in which the stone is an agent, because whatever action it performs is a consequence of some external force imparted to it. So the stone is not an originating actor, and perhaps not 'an agent' in that sense.

Another reference I think ought to be mentioned is the https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an06/an06.038.niza.html#fn-1, 'no self-doer, no other-doer'. This seems to argue strongly for the existence of agents, or 'self-doers'.  The commentary on this sutta says
Although the Buddha taught that there is no permanent, eternal, immutable, independently-existing core “self” (attā), he also taught that there is “action” or “doing”, and that it is therefore meaningful to speak of one who intends, initiates, sustains and completes actions and deeds, and who is therefore an ethically responsible and culpable being.
I do have some trouble reconciling that argument with the MMK, or the way it is often interpreted, anyway.

Malcolm wrote:
Hi Wayfarer:

The key to understanding everything is the term "dependent designation." We don't question the statement "I am going to town." In this there are three appearances, for convenience's sake, a person, a road, and a destination.

A person is designated on the basis of the aggregates, but there is no person in the aggregates, in one of the aggregates, or separate from the aggregates. Agreed? A road is designated in dependence on its parts, agreed? A town s designated upon its parts. Agreed?

If you agree to this, then you should have no problem with the following teaching of the Buddha in the Vimalakīrtinirdeśa Sūtra:

This body arises from various conditions, but lacks a self. This body is like the earth, lacking an agent. This body is like water, lacking a self. This body is like fire, lacking a living being. This body is like the wind, lacking a person. This body is like space, lacking a nature. This body is the place of the four elements, but is not real. This body that is not a self nor pertains to a self is empty.

In other words, when it comes to the conventional use of language, Buddha never rejected statements like "When I was a so and so in a past life, I did so and so, and served such and such a Buddha." Etc. But when it comes to what one can discern on analysis, if there is no person, no self, etc., that exists as more than a mere designation, the fact that agents cannot be discerned on analysis should cause no one any concern. It is merely a question of distinguishing between conventional use of language versus the insight into the nature of phenomena that results from ultimate analysis.

Malcolm wrote:
It is best if you consult the investigation into movement in the MMK, chapter two. This is where it is shown that agents are mere conventions. If one claims there is agent with agency, one is claiming the agent and the agency are separate. But if you claim that agency is merely a characteristic of an agent, when agent does not exercise agency, it isn't an agent since an agent that is not exercising agency is in fact a non-agent. Therefore, rather than agency being dependent on an agent, an agent is predicated upon exercising agency. For example, take movement. If there is an agent there has to be a moving mover. But there is no mover when there is no moving. Apart from moving, how could there be a mover? But when there is moving, there isn't a mover which is separate from moving. Even movement itself cannot be ascertained until there has been a movement. When there is no movement, there is no agent of movement. When there is moving, there is no agent of moving that can be ascertained to be separate from the moving. And since even moving cannot be ascertained without there either having been movement or not, moving itself cannot be established. Since moving cannot be established, a moving mover cannot be established. If a moving mover cannot be established, an agent cannot be established.

Any given object has two natures, according to Candrakīrti possesses two natures: one ultimate, one relative. If you are not happy with this, take it up with Candrakīrti.

Sherab said:
I am using the concepts of sets.

One set is the set of all objects that are eternal, namely permanent and unchanging.  The other is the set of all objects that cannot be a continuum because they are annihilated.  The set that avoid the two extremes is merely that set for any object that don't fall into either of the two other sets.

Malcolm wrote:
As I said, it does not matter whether you use this noun or that noun. Your proposed set is just another extreme: neither existent and nonexistent. This is just the fault of the fourth extreme, which is why it also needs to be negated. It is not enough to negate two extremes. You must negate all four.

Malcolm wrote:
How can there be something, no matter what noun you want to use, that avoids the two extremes? If there is something that avoids the two extremes, it is an extreme.

Your use here is an affirming negation. But freedom from extremes is by design a nonaffirming negation. In other words, when one negates existence, nonexistence is not being confirmed. When one negates nonexistence, existence is not being confirmed, and likewise, the same applies to the remaining two extremes. This is the reason why all four extremes are to be negated, not just the first two, otherwise, the fault of being an affirming negation also applies.

Regardless, the point still stands; if Hindu tantra is wrong how did Minapa attain Buddhahood if his guru was Shiva and he presumably would have practiced Saiva tantra?


Malcolm wrote:
The Tibetan text of Mīnapa's story begins by stating that his caste was fisherfolk, his guru was Mahādeva, and his siddhis were mundane siddhis. When you read the story carefully, though it is said he eventually traversed the paths and stages, it does not say that he does so with respect to the instructions he received from Mahādeva. The story is basically charming in its elements. A fisherman gets pulled into the water by a huge fish, and swallowed. Meanwhile, Umadevi is requesting a Dharma teaching from Mahādeva (who as we know, is by now a Buddhist, having been converted by Avalokiteśvara in the Karandavyuha Sūtra, etc. and tamed by Cakrasamvara). Mahādeva says he has a very secret teaching, but it should taught under the ocean, so no on can hear. They repair to their house in the depths of ocean, meanwhile, the fish that has swallowed the fisherman has come to rest below this house, and therefor, the fisherman can hear all that Mahādeva is teaching to Umadevi, who unfortunately falls asleep during the teaching. When Mahādeva realizes that Umadevi was sleeping through the teaching, he looks with the clairvoyance and understands that in the belly of the fish below his house, there is a man. He confers empowerment upon the fish [to empower the man inside it], and the man practices for 12 years in the belly of the fish. The fish is eventually caught, the fisherman is released, and everyone is amazed. The name of the teaching is not mentioned. It is stated Mīnapa, aka Vajrapāda, aka Acinta, works for the benefit of beings for five hundred years.

In the empowerment text composed by one of the Drukchen's on the basis of the empowerment text by Tārānātha, when Mīnapa, aka Acinta, teaches Gorakṣanātha, the name of a text is mentioned, and it is the text Amṛtasiddhi, which was composed by Brahmin Virupa, who in turn is a disciple of Lakṣminkara. According to Mallinson, Amṛtasiddhi is the Buddhist source text upon which all Hathayoga manuals depend.

So, all we really can know, from the earliest text we have on the 84 mahāsiddhas, is that Mīnapa achieved mundane siddhis under the tutelage of Mahādeva, and he eventually attained the state of Khecari, and that according to Tārānātha, the text he taught Gorakṣa is the Buddhist ancestor of Hathayoga.

I should add, there are other instances of Buddhist Vajrayāna traditions that are attributed to Shiva, in Lamdre, for example, where it is clarified that Mahādeva is a disciple of Vajradhara in one specific instructional cycle.

It has been thirty-two years since that book was published, and that we have much better informational resources available to us now than we did in 1986, in all areas of historical research on India and Tibet. Dowman's book, in light of modern scholarship, suffers from some anachronisms. It is not a completely reliable guide and one would be wise not to base hard and fast conclusions about the nature of the Mahāsiddhas and their religious affiliations viz. embracing Buddhism and Hinduism together upon his book. Mallinson, as I mentioned, is someone who has spent decades in India studying and practicing yoga, is expert in Sanskrit, and has researched the historical roots of the Naths based on primary material, with reference to the 84 siddhas, and so on.

For example, in his article, The Original Gorakṣaśataka, he notes that there is no use of the term "Nath" to refer to an order of yogis prior to the 18th century. Thus, there are serious problems with the claim that the mahāsiddhas you mention are "naths."

Indian Nonbuddhist religion fares little better in this respect. After all, the bible of Hinduism, the Bhagavad Gita, is a religious dialogue set in the midst of a brutal internecine between relatives. Then, of course, there is the racism of the varna system.

Dzogpa Chenpo is always there to be realized isn't it?  So why is there a difference?

Malcolm wrote:
When Dzogchen is not realized, it is the basis.

Sherab said:
So ultimate phenomena is the phenomena at the limit of analysis?  What is this limit?

Malcolm wrote:
When you find it, report back to us.

Sherab said:
Let me guess: the limit of analysis is that there is nothing to be found.  Therefore the statement that Dzogchen is the single state of relative and ultimate phenomena means that at the limit of analysis there is nothing that can be found.

In other words, at the limit of analysis nothing is found.  The ultimate phenomena is therefore nothing.  Since the ultimate is nothing, the relative phenomena is also nothing.

Since both relative and ultimate phenomena is nothing, they can only be illusions.  They are not even illusion-like as the Gelugpas tended to argue.

Malcolm wrote:
I would not say that such phenomena are nothing, since they appear. They cannot be found on analysis, but since their existence cannot be found, also their nonexistence cannot be found either.

You must have seen that I have introduced elsewhere Rongzom's assertion that only in Dzogchen are the full implications of illusion spelled out: with the consequence that everything, including buddhahood, is absolutely equivalent with an illusion.

Sherab said:
If the argument is correct, then natural follow-on question would be how do illusions arise when there is nothing for any senses to perceive?

Malcolm wrote:
Illusory senses of illusory sentient beings perceive illusory appearances, which arise just like phantasms in the sky, and so on. This is the meaning of arising from conditions.

That's what I thought, and seems to be really a pretty basic mistake if I'm understanding correctly, because any phenomenon whatsoever arises via dependent origination. It's not about finding something 'outside' of this process, but rather realizing the nature of the process itself. Do you know how the gzhan stong view like this got started - who started it, based on what, etc? Was it a reaction against a sort of nihilistic interpretation of Madhyamaka?

If you don't know offhand certainly don't look it up - I could do that - but if you know I'd be curious. And for any feedback otherwise.

Malcolm wrote:
It arose out of the experience of an early 11th century Tibetan named Tsen Kawoche, who was a disciple of a Kashmiri master, Sajjana, who taught the five treatises of Maitreya to a group of Tibetans, of which Tsen was a part. Unfortunately, it is recorded that Tsen did not understand Sanskrit well. Nevertheless, when he returned to Tibet, he began a school of exegesis on the five treatises. These days some gzhan stong pas claim his school is the experiential transmission of the Uttaratantra, as opposed to Ngog Lotsawa's school of exegetical transmission (Ngog is the translator of the five treatises and was present during these same teachings).

The next person of import is an 11-12th century fellow named Yumo Mikyo Dorje, a master in the Bro lineage of Kalacakra. He is the one who is considered to have elaborated a so called "tantric gzhan stong." In fact, Yumo asserts both forms of Madhyamaka as well as Dzogchen advance a nihilistic emptiness. This is funny if one considers that some Nyingmapas, perhaps unaware of the intellectual history of gzhan stong, have embraced it.

Dolbuwa combined both of these masters views into a comprehensive system labeled gzhan stong.

Also, it is an error to assert that east Asian Buddhists are "Yogacārins." Yogācāra is a well understood school in East Asian Buddhism, thanks to Hsuan Tsang, and no one really follows his school. Yogacāra is definitely not considered a definitive position by native Huayen scholars, Tientai scholars, Chan scholars, and so on.

Interestingly enough, the idea that East Asian Buddhism is unduly influenced by Yogacāra is basically a Gelgupa idea advanced by Thuken and taken up by some western scholars.

This is sometimes called "nonabiding nirvana." The difference is not in content, i.e., the nirvana is the same; the difference is in whether or not the ārya in question abides or does not abide in that cessation. Arhats and pratyekabuddhas do abide in that cessation, buddhas and bodhisattvas do not.

BTW, just for the record, these days I personally am gravitating away from Shentong and towards what I think Situ R. calls "rongtong ma yin gag"(?). From what I could make of his explanation, it is basically Madhyamaka with the positive qualities of Buddha Nature naturally occurring. That way emptiness can be presented as the tetra lemma, but also having spontaneous positive qualities, without the whole problem of positing an unmanifest sub-stratum, etc. It splits the difference.

Malcolm wrote:
In other words, you are leaning towards a true Madhyamaka understanding of the buddhanature doctrine, more like Longchenpa and less like Dolbupa.

This is a good thing. Tathāgatagarbha is not necessarily in conflict with the view of Nāgārjuna and Candrakīrti, thought it still remains a provisional doctrine that requires some interpretation.

I think it important to acknowledge how epic Malcolm's accomplishment is in that boast. Khenpo Tsultrim would be loathe to admit that his personal view was equivalent to a tirthika heresy. Khenpo Tsultrim doesn't speak English, so Malcolm had to best him in Tibetan. And Khenpo Tsultrim is one of the top Kagyu Khenpos. That's freaking amazing. And I believe Malcolm. I have confidence he is capable of such a thing. I do not believe he just make that up.

With no disrespect meant to either Malcolm or KTG, I would need a bit more context on the nature of the similarity/difference before concluding that Shentong was monistic

Malcolm wrote:
There are structural similarities in the way gzhan stong and Advaita articulate the distinction between ultimate and relative. According to gzhan stong, the ultimate (parinispanna) is empty of all relative phenomena (paratantra and parikalpita), and is utterly distinct from it. Likewise, nirguna brahmin is devoid of māya. In this respect they are structurally similar. KTG admitted this structural similarity, and protested, that nevertheless, there is no buddhahood in Advaita. This conversation was conducted with his translator, Jim Scott, it happened in 1992, so I doubt Scott would remember.

However, this does not make gzhan stong monistic. My point was quite different.

But I now realise that Buddhists traditionally saw the Hindu sages as heretics and adversaries, to be defeated in debate and generally viewed with disdain. I was a bit shocked when I first encountered that.   Now that I understand the historical context a little better, I can understand it, kind of. But the world is a global village, and a very different context for the discussion. I remember the cross-cultural Christian Advaitin, Bede Griffith, remarking once that the real adversary of any spiritual philosophy today is the scientific materialism which rules the secular west, which sees all consciousness as a mere adaption, and that devotees of all traditions would do well to remember it.

Malcolm wrote:
I would much rather live in a world where scientific materialism rules the secular west, than a world in which the west becomes taken over by the batshit crazy evangelical Christians, who are in fact no different in their thinking that ISIS, the Taliban, etc. At least, scientific materialism operates from an evidence-based perspective, even if it is not complete picture. Candrakīrti observes that Buddhists in reality are very similar to Caravakas, ancient Indian materialists, with the exception that Buddhists accept the dependent origination of individual consciousness, whereas Carvakas asserted that "things just happen."

The issue at hand is the incompatibility of Theism in any of its forms, with Buddhism. Even Advaita is, in the end, a substantialist metaphysical system. Only Buddhism can claim to be free of substantialist metaphysics. What substantialist ideas there are in Buddhism in the Nikāya schools are arguably the result of the influence of Western ideas that came to India through the conquest of Bactria by Alexander. But where they are present in lower schools, they are negated in Mahāyāna.

Jeff H said:
Could someone clarify for me why I find the phrase "from the beginning" so often in Dzogchen? In context it seems to mean that such and such has never not been the case. But the word "beginning" seems to imply a first cause and first event. Instead of "[it] has been pure from the beginning", why does not say, "[it] has always been pure"? What's the real meaning of "beginning" here?

Malcolm wrote:
In some Dzogchen texts, "beginning" refers to putative state prior to the separation of samsara and nirvana. But it is not to be taken too literally. The term ye nas generally forms part of a compound past participle phrase of whatever verb is being used in the sentence. Sometimes it needs to be translated as "primordially," when an adjectival use is indicated.

Some phrases, like ka nas dag pa, for example, are also compound past participle phrases. In general, we can understand such compound past participle phrases as indicating that something is innate. In sutras, one does not find ka nas dag pa, but one does find very frequently gzod ma nas dag pa, which is identical in meaning. This "pure from the beginning" just means "innately pure."

Malcolm wrote:
I pretty well aware of the historical context. Shankara went to great lengths to prophylactically reject the ideas that his POV was derived from Mahāyāna, as anyone who has actually read Shankara will know.

The main claim for Buddhist influence on Shankara comes from the fact that his paramaguru was a guy named Gaudapāda, the fourth chapter of whose Agamaśastra seems to borrow heavily from Madhyamaka and Yogacāra arguments, somewhat indiscriminately, to refute Samkhya and Vaiśesika scholars, and to propose ajativāda. However, given that Shankara does in fact go to great lengths to forestall the criticism of being a crypto-Buddhist, this should perhaps lead us to conclude that he wasn't a crypto-Buddhist,, and that his opponents such as Vijñāna Bhikṣu, Ramanuja, and so on, were all just a bit lazy in their thinking.

Contaminated merit is exhausted as soon as its ripens, therefore, it cannot be accumulated, per se.  It's like cash under your bed. Once you've spent it, its gone.

Uncontaminated merit is inexhaustible, in that it continues to ripen as positive results. Hence, it can be accumulated. It's like cash in an interest bearing account, it continues to produce value and increase on its own, even though it is being stored away.

Uncontaminated merit comes about from dedicating one's virtuous actions for the benefit of sentient beings, while simultaneously being cognizant there are are no sentient beings to whom merit is being dedicated, there is no merit to dedicate, and no one dedicating such merit.

Contaminated merit is exhausted as soon as its ripens, therefore, it cannot be accumulated, per se.  It's like cash under your bed. Once you've spent it, its gone.

Uncontaminated merit is inexhaustible, in that it continues to ripen as positive results. Hence, it can be accumulated. It's like cash in an interest bearing account, it continues to produce value and increase on its own, even though it is being stored away.

Uncontaminated merit comes about from dedicating one's virtuous actions for the benefit of sentient beings, while simultaneously being cognizant there are are no sentient beings to whom merit is being dedicated, there is no merit to dedicate, and no one dedicating such merit.

This brief moment of altruism is held to be the seed that allowed the Buddha to eventually cease being reborn in hell, and eventually, take birth in higher realms, and so on, meet the Buddhist path, etc.

As far as Buddhists go, if they do not dedicate their merit properly, it is also part of contaminated, expendable merit. If they dedicate that merit properly it becomes part of the merit accumulation and is never expended or exhausted, and becomes the basis for rebirth in the three higher realms, and specifically, the human realm, and more specifically, human birth with the eighteen freedoms and endowments.

If a good Christian meets the Dharma, this is a sign a) they have met the Dharma in the past and b) that they have abandoned refuge in Jesus and taken refuge in the Buddha, exchanging a wrong path for a right path. If they go on to become a Mahayānist, then they have exchanged a lower path for a higher path. If they then enter secret mantra, they have exchanged a slow path for a quick path. If they enter Dzoghen teachings, they have exchanged a path with effort for a path with no effort.

Some show various practices of wrong livelihood,
Practicing incorrect principles as supreme;
Some manifest the postures of brahmin ascetics,

Some practice cults imitating animal sounds,
Some put on filthy clothing and worship fire:
In order to transform such cultists, they become their teachers.

Some make a show of visiting various shrines of various deities,
Some make a show of entering the water of the Ganges River,
Some eat roots and fruits, all making a show of these practices,
While always contemplating the truth that transcends them.

Some show themselves kneeling or standing on one foot,
Some lie on thorns or in dust and dirt,
Some lie on pounding stones, seeking release,
And become teachers and leaders of such groups.

Of such followers of heretical paths
They observe the minds and understandings, and they do the same things;
The ascetic practices they demonstrate, worldlings cannot bear:
They cause them to be tamed after seeing them.

Sentient beings are deluded and accept false teachings;
Sticking to wrong views, they suffer many pains:
For them are expediently taught the wonderful principles
To cause them to understand the genuine truth.

The four truths may be explained in local magical language,
Or the four truths may be told in skillful esoteric language,
Or the four truths my be spoken in direct human speech,
Or the four truths may be told in the language of divine mystery;
The four truths are explained through analysis of words,
The four truths are explained through aacertainment of principles,
The four truths are explained skillfully refuting others,
The four truths are explained undisturbed by outsiders;
The four truths may be explained in several languages,
Or they may be explained in all languages.
In whatever languages beings understand
The four truths are explained for them, to liberate them,
All the teachings of all Buddhas
Are thus explained exhaustively,
Knowing the realm of language is inconceivable:
This is called the power of concentration of expounding the truth

I am extremely grateful to you, Malcolm, for helping usher me into Dzogchen. At the same time, I've argued a number of times on DW that without my sutrayana preparations, I don't think I would have been able to accept what you offered.

Malcolm wrote:
Sūtrayāna is part of the Dharma. It has the right view, it just not have the most efficacious means.

Jeff H said:
As a staunch believer in rebirth, I also take this back to all the lives that have preceded this one in which something must have been going on to generate the karma I'm enjoying now. What Dan calls "liberative insight" seems to me to be necessary precondition to discovering buddhadharma.

Malcolm wrote:
In the past, you met the Dharma, specifically you met Dzogchen teachings. This is the cause and condition that allowed you to meet the Dharma again, and specifically, Dzogchen teachings.

There is a need for band-aids until one is capable of a cure. Just because someone is not on the final path at this time doesn't mean they aren't heading in that direction.

Malcolm wrote:
All samsaric beings without the Dharma are wandering around in the darkness of the ocean of samsara. They are like the proverbial turtle who rises to the surface (human birth) of the ocean (the three lower realms) every one hundred years. It is exceedingly rare that they surface within the golden yoke (the Dharma) floating on the ocean.

Human beings who do not meet the Dharma in this life have no guarantee that they will attain a human birth in the next. Even if they do meet the Dharma in this life, unless they attain at least the level of patience on the path of application (prayogamarga), there is still no guarantee they will take rebirth as human beings in the next life, and not in one of the three lower realms.

Even if the practice of Christian/Muslim/Jewish/Hindu, etc., virtue does lead to birth in various deva realms, so what? Once that merit is exhausted, such beings will fall immediately into lower realms.

When I see people vigorously defending non-buddhist institutions as beneficial and liberative, I think people need to review the four common foundations a bit more, in particular, the faults of samsara and the eighteen freedoms and endowments, not to mention impermanence and death, as well as karma and its result.

This is separate from ecumenical concerns, which have to do with living in diverse human communities where there are people of differing religious orientations. But this is a Buddhist board, so we needn't be concerned with such niceties here.

The problem, Dan, is that it does not root out the problem. It merely puts off the problem to another life. There are all kinds of secular and religious systems that proffer solutions to such existential problems, but they all fail to address the root of the problem in its entirety, with the sole exception of Buddhadharma. Thus, their solutions are merely bandaids that do not really solve anything.

Grigoris said:
So for you a rough, impetuous and unkind Buddhist is in a better position than a gentle, thoughtful and kind Christian?

Malcolm wrote:
Most definitely. The former has met the Dharma, the latter has not. Even worse, the latter has embarked upon a path in which there is no liberation from samsara at all.

Grigoris said:
Is the accumulation of merit a bandaid now?

Malcolm wrote:
Merit can only be accumulated if it is dedicated in such a way that the dedication is free from the three spheres: an object of dedication, the act of dedication, and a dedicating subject. All other merit is exhaustible and does not form part of the merit accumulation.

It is a historical issue whether Mahayana was taught by Shakyamuni or not.

Malcolm wrote:
That very much depends on what one means by "history." All the history books available to me in Tibetan, for example, assert very strongly Mahāyāna was taught by the Buddha. The only history books that dispute this claim are by western academics, who have no real practical interest in Buddhadharma anyway. For them, it is an intellectual game.

There are also sectarian Theravadins, who have seized the western academic point of view, which is not surprising at all, since Theravada is nearly a wholly reconstructed tradition that owes everything to the Pali Text society and Western colonialism that was given new legs by Protestant scholars searching for an "original Buddhism."

This is what I call 'a liberative insight'. It is not awakening, but it is in the right direction, IMO, and for you who proudly believes in rebirth, transmigration, etc. this will surely add to better karma and a better rebirth than continuing to grasp firmly at the self and causing suffering to others.

Evidence is in the eye of the beholder, aka confirmation bias. I see plenty of evidence, including from my immediate family. My own father after accepting Jesus experienced a profound transformation, which all around him saw. A difficult man prone to criticising others and anger outbursts, over a relatively short time became a gentle soul and a thoughtful and kind individual.

Malcolm wrote:
Nice, but not liberative. Accepting Jesus into one's life is not going to end rebirth in the samsara, at all, not even a little bit.


Dan74 said:
These radical changes happen because of liberative insights.

Malcolm wrote:
I guess we have different ideas of what "liberative" entails. Becoming a nicer person does not equal liberation. Such a person has not eradicated the very forces that keep them being reborn in samsara over and over again, i.e., the three afflictions. They may be able to suppress them, refrain from acting them out, but without eliminating them from the root, these very afflictions cause actions which result in suffering, if not in the rest of this life, then in future lives, since they have not been utterly eliminated.

Your suggested insight can be likened to giving a patient with a severe infection a weak antibiotic, which causes the acute symptoms of the infection to vanish, but does not eliminate the disease completely, allowing it to reappear when conditions ripen.

Dan74 said:
How we describe them, the conceptual frameworks, vary, but the deep effect on us is the same. You appear to take the prisciptions [sic] a bit too literally - there is only one way. Not sure about complete liberation - may well be that there is only one way, but before the summit, the ground is wider and many paths abound.

Malcolm wrote:
As far as becoming free of samsaric birth is concerned, there is only one way. All other paths are dead ends.

But perhaps you are one of those Zen dudes who does not accept rebirth, transmigration, etc. If this is the case, then I can easily see why you find it hard to differentiate Buddhist insight from the insight of Christianity and so on. I have often opined that if someone does not accept rebirth, they are better off in some other path.

A genuine insight is one that removes (some) ignorance and delusion. Are you saying that this is impossible outside formal Buddhist practice?

Malcolm wrote:
Of course there is such thing as mundane insight, for example, insight into the workings of a bee colony, the psyche of human beings, etc.

But what we are discussing here is liberative insight, which puts an end to birth in samsara. That does [not] exist outside the pale of Budddhadharma.

Dan74 said:
Seems that pesky unconscious got the better of you, Malcolm. Ah well, another thing that you hold not to exist, along the insight outside the Budddhadharma. Never mind, back to the regular broadcast.

Malcolm wrote:
Dan, don't be daft. Typos happen and they are not indications of concession.

As I said, there are mundane insights outside of Buddhadharma. But there is NO liberative insight outside Buddhadharma. And yes, there is no such thing as the "unconscious mind."

The problem with your point of view—that there can be insight equivalent to Buddhist insight—is that there is absolutely no evidence of it, anywhere.

Thought you would say that, as you can only advocate from the perspective of differentiating Buddhism from every other school, philosophy and tradition. However the perspective I'm trying to draw on, is that of comparative religion and philosophy. Like you, I recognise that Buddhism is the superior vehicle, but unlike you, I don't therefore conclude that all other philosophies are hopelessly deluded or wrong-headed. After all we're dealing here with claims about universal truths.

Malcolm wrote:
No, we are dealing with the question, "What ends rebirth, and what does not." There is no other school, apart from Buddhadharma, that deals with this question adequately, or frankly, even asks the question at all.

Wayfarer said:
To chart these ideas as they are expressed in various cultural milieux is not at all to say they're all simply the same, or all saying the same thing. But it can help frame the subject against a broader background.

Malcolm wrote:
Unlike you, I don't believe in universal truths, since I don't hold that there are ultimate positions that can be held to be true for every religion and philosophy. I think there are common ideas amongst the eternalist religions, but those ideas do not apply to Buddhadharma, since Buddhadharma rejects first causes, etc.
