The terms for Sanskrit and Tibetan respectively are rūpa and gzugs. It is become a common thing for translators to translate rūpaskandha as the "form aggregate", but it is not accurate and does not correspond with the definition of form in English "configuration, formation, structure, construction, arrangement, appearance, exterior, outline, format, layout, design." What does correspond is "matter", i.e. "constituent, raw material, element, component."

When we are taking about the rūpāyatana, the sense base of form, however, the object of the eye, then form is perfect, i.e., "configuration, formation, structure, construction, arrangement, appearance, exterior, outline, format, layout, design."

Words are relative, but they important in that they shape our understanding. If the terms we use are not accurate, how can our understanding be accurate? Geshe Dhargye never thought about these things in English. He did not know English. The fault lies with his translators.

Arctic sea ice extent for May 2015 averaged 12.65 million square kilometers (4.88 million square miles), the third lowest May ice extent in the satellite record. This is 730,000 square kilometers (282,000 square miles) below the 1981 to 2010 long-term average of 13.38 million square kilometers (5.17 million square miles) and 70,000 square kilometers (27,000 square miles) above the record low for the month, observed in 2004.

Malcolm wrote:

WeiHan said:
Sea ice in the Arctic Ocean is at its lowest May level since records began in the 1980s.
Ice coverage around the North Pole is currently just 11.32m sq km, compared with a 30 year average of 12.5m sq km.
This figure is even lower than the 11.89m sq km of 2012, when sea ice coverage reached its lowest summer time level. Ice extent generally reaches its lowest level in mid September. In 2012 there were just 3.2m sq km of sea ice in the Arctic.
Arctic sea ice decreased at a rate of around four percent per decade between 1978 and 1996, according to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
The IPCC expects the extent of sea ice to decrease by 20 percent by 2050, with some ice-free summers by the same time.
Melting sea ice does not affect sea levels but it does affect the amount of heat that is absorbed. Typically sea ice reflects between 50 and 70 percent of incoming solar radiation, compared with just seven to 10 percent by ocean water.
This is likely to result in accelerating warming in the Arctic, which in turn, raises the likelihood of accelerating ice loss – a negative feedback.
A loss of sea ice reduces the protection afforded to coastal regions and is expected to result in higher waves and an increase in storm surges, inundation and coastal erosion.
The loss of sea ice does have some benefits; previously inaccessible shipping routes will become open to commercial traffic.
For example, voyage times between Rotterdam, Netherlands and Yokohama, Japan, would be reduced by 40 percent using this Northern Sea Route compared with the conventional route through the Suez Canal.
It is uncertain whether this year’s rapid decrease in coverage will be maintained, but warm air over Canada and Alaska is expected to move across the North Pole in the coming week.
The melting of surface ice sets up melt ponds which absorb heat and make the acceleration of ice loss much more likely.

Your perception of a snake, and reacting to it viscerally is still 2 and 3. 2 and 3 are mental factors also, but because they have such a strong role in samsara, they are treated as separate aggregates.

See.

Data released showed that "global warming" stopped 16 years ago. The graphs even show that it is cyclical.

http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2217286/Global-warming-stopped-16-years-ago-reveals-Met-Office-report-quietly-released--chart-prove-it.html
So their model is predicting a continuous increase of surface temperature but yet temperature has stalled for 16 years and they have to come up with a cycle theory to patch up an explanation. What does it says? Bottom line, even for a novice that didn't read up their explanation, you should be able to conclude that the model that they have been relying on is inaccurate.
The linear trend from August 1997 (in the middle of an exceptionally strong El Nino) to August 2012 (coming at the tail end of a double-dip La Nina) is about 0.03°C/decade, amounting to a temperature increase of 0.05°C over that period, but equally we could calculate the linear trend from 1999, during the subsequent La Nina, and show a more substantial warming.
As we’ve stressed before, choosing a starting or end point on short-term scales can be very misleading. Climate change can only be detected from multi-decadal timescales due to the inherent variability in the climate system. If you use a longer period from HadCRUT4 the trend looks very different. For example, 1979 to 2011 shows 0.16°C/decade (or 0.15°C/decade in the NCDC dataset, 0.16°C/decade in GISS). Looking at successive decades over this period, each decade was warmer than the previous – so the 1990s were warmer than the 1980s, and the 2000s were warmer than both. Eight of the top ten warmest years have occurred in the last decade.

Hi Malcolm and Johnny,

The problem is that since I've started practicing, these afflictive states have been stronger, more and prolonged. Before, there was not much tension/swinging emotions/delusions, maybe it's because I am trying to observe and not let anything manifest in my mind (and/or) letting it manifest but not reacting to it.

I guess I am afraid of creating future suffering through my afflictive states because once I have thought something bad, I am already creating bad karma. The biggest hindrance to this is my self-deception, ego, and self-centeredness. How can I be more honest and sincere in accepting my mistakes and faults?

Thank you Malcolm for answering my post.  I'm still confused as to how it is "miserable compassion" to not engage in meat eating.  I've never heard him specify that it's okay for practitioners of the lower tantras to be vegetarians.  In fact, at the teaching in LA he became red faced and angry and it appeared to me that he slammed his fist down in denouncing vegetarians, he didn't specify as to which practitioners could still be vegetarians. He never mentioned any scriptural reference or commentarial reference to back up this statement. Do you know of any?  I have no doubt that Norbu is an enlightened being, it's just that his statements run counter to statements by Chatral Rinpoche and other Dzogchen masters. I thought as Buddhists we were supposed to do no harm.  I'm just a blue collar guy in rural Northern California and this really has my head spinning.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, the famous one that ChNN always quotes from the Hevajra Tantra (though you won't find it in the extant two chapter version)
Those with compassion eat meat;
those with samaya drink alcohol.
The Hevajra also observes that one should not distinguish between pure foods (i.e. acceptable to Brahmins) and impure foods.

Then in a treasure of Kunzang Dechen Lingpa connected with six dimensions of Samantabhadra mantra (འ་ཨ་ཧ་ཤ་ས་མ), it is said:
If yogins who possess great compassion cannot help but accept meat and blood, that should be considered to be the flesh and blood is a sentient being that is actually present...Yogins who have created bodhicitta, there is nothing more profound than this to benefit migrating beings! For example, there isn’t anyway to guide sentient beings who have no connections. As in the aforementioned example, likewise after flesh and blood is enjoyed in a feast, their minds are purified and sent up [into the dharmadhātu].  All my lineage of followers should practice this in earnest, bringing benefit both to themselves and others.

In Tibetan Buddhism, as anywhere else, success is rewarded with accolade and failure is rewarded with obscurity, and it really has very little to do with puritan notions of authenticity, as much as we may wish it to be otherwise.
"Authenticity" is actually something to be valued, if the lineages are not to decline, long-term. This is not to say that the Tibetans had their act together on this matter all the time.

Malcolm wrote:
You are completely missing my point. My first point is that no one's qualifications to be a teacher has ever been established or refuted on a board such as Dharmawheel, and so on. My second point is that as long as someone can get some Tibetan to vouch for them, it is very difficult to make an argument that someone is an "inauthentic" teacher.

Those of us who have studied the actual history of Tibetan Buddhism, such as yourself, should understand that charges of charlatanism are quite wide spread among all four schools. We should also understand that charges of charlatanism have never ever prevented anyone from gathering students, building monasteries, funding stupas, statues, pujas, shedras and so on. The Shugden affair should prove that much to everyone. Do most of us here regard Shugden as inauthentic? Yes? Do most of us here regard teachers who promulgate this practice as inauthentic? Yes. Does that stop Shugdenpas in the slightest? No! The same thing applies to Michael Roach, and other "controversial" teachers.

Truly, the people who loose the most in this game of authenticity are the self-appointed purveyors of imagined authenticity. In order to question the authenticity of another teacher, first one must prove that one is in fact an arbiter of such authenticity. None of us here can do this. Because of this, accusing this women of being a fraud or a charlatan is a losing game. It is also unfair, and even sexist.

Honestly, the best practice is that when someone you know personally approaches you in private about this or that teachers credentials, then you can give your opinion — but making a public spectacle out of someone who is regarded as a teacher by others is simple bad form. I know, because I have been involved in this practice in the past and now regard it as folly.

You will recall that even Chogyur Lingpa in the beginning was derided as a charlatan. It was mainly due to his association with Khyentse Wangpo that his revelations were found acceptable.

But now, it's as if I have forgotten everything and the earlier renunciation seems to have faded, and I don't sense much urgency like before.

What can I do if I relapse with my practice? I feel so guilty, ashamed, and can't shake out the self-hate and self-blaming when I wasn't practicing mentally very well throughout the day. My anger and aggression keeps coming up and it completely overwhelms me that I end up mentally thinking bad things about others, hating them, blaming them and then I regret it and keep going round and round in circles. When I get angry at my friends and family, since I've harmed them, I can't shake out the anger, guilt, blame, and hate towards myself. Also, the most saddest thing is my self-deception, "oh it's ok, I can try even harder and purify next time even if I have gotten angry at someone..."

Skill means is of four kinds: the skill in ripening sentient beings is the four means of conversion; [sentient beings] are placed in the virtues because of having been gathered by those [four means]

Queequeg said:
Please correct me if I'm mistaken.

My understanding of skillful means is that the being led by skillful means does not know that they are being led by skillful means. They may have no idea that they are being drawn onto the path. Its only in retrospect that they might realize they were being led.

I don't think this is at odds with the commentaries you cited.

In other words, we do not tell people oh, Jesus taught Buddhahood. We can say to Christians who show an interest in Dharma, however, "Jesus and Buddha are alike in that they both taught compassion", and then explain why the compassion taught by the Buddha is more profound than that taught by Jesus, etc.

Thanks for the clarification.  I hear what you're saying and appreciate it.

For me, I don't see the difference between the ritual sacrifice of Eid al-Adha and ritual sacrifice of dabihah (making halal meat).  I don't think a Buddhist should be present at either, or partake of the meat of either.

Malcolm wrote:
So then in that case you, as a Vajrayāna practitioner, are condemning that animal to further samsara by refusing to partake of its meat at all. It is one thing to refuse lobster mistakenly killed for you by a host. The purpose of this is to make it clear that it is not an honor to slaughter animals for guests in order to prevent the idea that Buddhist monks in particular will be partial to those who kill their best animals in return for prayers and so on. It is quite another thing, if one is a meat eater, to refuse a kosher frank on the grounds that is was slaughtered according to a religious custom in which one played no part and refuse to consume it according to criteria laid out for the beneficial consumption of meat by lamas like ChNN and Kunzang Dechen Lingpa. Ironically, virtually all of the meat eaten by Tibetans in Lhasa in the past, and these days in, India is Halal. There have been some very blatantly racist attempts by Tibetans in Tibet to get Tibetans to stop eating in Muslim resturants (such as the story that they gather the lice that feed on country people, the resulting human blood from which makes their food more tasty, or that they use the foot washing water of Imams to somehow magically convert people to Islam), but nevertheless, Tibetans continue to frequent Muslim restaurants and eat halal meat everywhere they are.

It is an incoherent argument to suggest that Buddhists should not attend Eid al-Adha (agreed) but that Buddhists eating halal or koshet meat is fine.  If you look at it closely, dabihah, ritual slaughter of animals for halal meat, is effectively ritual sacrifice as Allah's name must be evoked, the animal's head turn to the qibla, the direction of prayer, towards Mecca, the Qaaba, and so on.

The other aspect is that halal slaughter maximizes the suffering of the animal, so it is no different than Eid al-Adha.  The animals are not stunned before theyir throats are slit.

Even if a Buddhist eats meat through the three purities and so on, unless halal is given as alms or as a gift fron a host, I would think a Buddhist would avoid halal like contagion.

But that's just me.

No, I did not say one should avoid either. Once the animal is dead, it is dead and there is no further suffering one is causing by going to a Middle Eastern Restaurant, for example, run by Muslims and ordering the lamb kabob. Same with a Kosher frank.

The problem lies in supporting a religious activity predicated on ignorance, not in eating meat itself.

The question of meat eating is separate.

Most people are not going to run into Halal meat in the US. In the rare instance they do, they probably won't know it. If you go to a Muslim country, most of the meat will be of that variety.

Eating food slaughtered with a prayer is not the same thing as attending a religious festival predicated on the ritual slaughter of millions of animals. I can see why some people think they are commensurate, but I do not. In the former case, you, as a practitioner, have a chance to benefit the animal with a mantra, no matter how it was slaughtered; in the latter case you are lending support to something which is done out of ignorance.

Frankly, I have noted a process, repeated often in western organizations, where after building a student base (even if considered charlatans), said organizers are then granted full legitimacy by some Tibetan, sometimes famous, sometimes obscure.

The process runs as follows; build students, present them to a lineage teacher (with donations to favored charities of course), have the lineage teacher recognize you as the teacher of said group of students, eventually gain recognition as a reincarnation or an emanation (or failing that, just be titled Lama So and So) — boom, you have arrived. Now you can confidently get articles published in Buddhadharma, Shambhala Sun, Tricycle, and land that Harper-Collins book deal you have been craving so that you can crack into the "Barnes & Nobles" Buddhist scene.

In Tibetan Buddhism, as anywhere else, success is rewarded with accolade and failure is rewarded with obscurity, and it really has very little to do with puritan notions of authenticity, as much as we may wish it to be otherwise.

Not remotely qualified either but IMHO the kind response from Garchen Institute is not quite the whole story. Apologies all round if I am incorrect, but Rinpoche has made his own statement on this. I can't remember exactly where I read it, but it is out there somewhere. It was a carefully qualified statement.

Boomerang said:
His qualifications were that you need faith and the recording should be be necessity, not a convenience. You should only rely on recorded empowerments if you are unable to get them live. The whole reason he started doing this was that he felt bad for people who traveled long distances for empowerments. He also said that the power of the video comes from your faith and devotion to the dharma, so if you have no faith an empowerment won't work even if you are there live.

Malcolm wrote:
The reasoning is the same as the following "If one has sufficient faith in some tantra one wants to practice, one can receive the empowerment from the book." This reasoning is condemned by the Buddha in the tantras themselves. The Buddha teaches in the Mahāmudratilaka Tantra:
Without empowerment there is no siddhi,
just as pressing sand yields no oil. 
If someone reveals the tantras and agamas with pride
to those who lack empowerment,
as soon as [both] master and disciple die
they go to hell even if they obtained siddhi.
The commentary to this tantra, the Śrīguhyārthaprakāśamahādbhūta-nāma, states:
...the disciple upon whom the empowerment is correctly bestowed becomes a suitable vessel for the topics of the profound intimate instructions of the body and so on. Without that however, if the meaning of the tantras is revealed to one who lacks empowerment, it is said the master and the disciple have a root downfall.
One should be very aware of the faults of not receiving empowerment. For example, The Mind Mirror of Vajrasattva Tantra states:
Where will accomplishment be without relying on the empowerments of secret mantra? For example, like a boatman without a paddle, how will one be able to cross to the other side?
The Self-arisen Vidyā Tantra states:
The faults of not obtaining the empowerment are as follows: in the bardo one is alarmed, panicked, exhausted, impeded, and also one can lose consciousness. 
While one has not left the body of traces, migrating beings will not see one as worthy of respect. One’s merit will be small, one’s life short, one’s enjoyments of living will be few, one will be powerless and many obstacles will occur. Nothing will be accomplished. Those are the faults of not obtaining the empowerment for the practice of Secret Mantra.
So people who are interested in Vajrayāna should think very carefully about what is valid and what is not valid, one's path depends on it. In this respective, a conservative approach will never harm one.

People of such a tradition see animal sacrifice, including Eid al-Adha, as haram, not hallal.

Actually, it might if there is something in the complexity of advanced physical systems that ignites awareness. But this is to bring 'mind' into "matter", which is known as animism

Herbie said:
From my perspective using the word "mind" and associating "animism" is just the effect of not knowing yet what science still has to find out about what I called "conscious events". The issue here is that language which is based on subject-object-dualism is "applied to something" (again language!) which actually is not "something" but the ideating subject expressing itself which is without that dualism. But there is no way out.
"A bulb is emitting light."
"A reaction of material chemicals is emitting heat or radioactive rays."
"A specific organisational structure of organic material is emitting conscious events."
Issue here is that the latter expression must fall short of linguistically expressing the transformation from subject-object to "non-dual subject" perspective. It always is fixed in linguistic subject-object-dualism merely through the fact that the expression has to be read (expression as object) and an idea synthesized which again mirrors subject-object-dualism of language. Therefore the meaning of "A specific organisational structure of organic material is emitting conscious events." rarely is understood appropriately. The same holds true with "every conscious event is just a representation of neuronal processes."

Malcolm,
Changchub Dorje had a terma for the construction of 108 special stupas to avert the Chinese invasion of Tibet, and these were never built. But could they be built outside of Tibet, and have a similar effect (on negativities)? Or do we need entirely new termas for this purpose, or are there specific stupas already existing that would be built according to how each location is (qualifications, properties, etc.)?

And while we're on the topic of stupas, how much does a stupa with its construction cost? I know it depends on size, type of stupa, how it's made, and so on, but does anybody have an estimate price from at least the lowest price possible while still having a fully qualified and effective stupa that fulfills its purpose, like for example the stupas of Changchub Dorje's stupa terma.


Malcolm wrote:
It was a time sensitive terma.

A proper stupa would cost at least $50,000. So one would need $5,400,000, not including the land, at minimum. That does not include zoning, permits, etc.

I like this piece of advice from ChNN's "Dzogchen: The Self-Perfected State": The Dzogchen teachings advise one never to force the condition of one's energy, but always to be aware of its limits in all the various circumstances one encounters. If at times one does not feel like sitting down to practice then one should avoid setting up a struggle against oneself. It could be that there is some problem of our energy that we don't know about behind our feeling like this. In such situations it is important to know how to relax, and how to give  oneself space, in order not to block the progress of one's practice. Problems of loneliness, of depression, of mental confusion and so on, also often derive from an unbalanced condition of our energy.

Jikan said:
I was hoping to go back to Malcolm's important posts on Rawls and subsequent libertarian thought.  What differentiates Rawls from thinkers like Nozick, Friedman, Hayek, von Mises, or G Becker, and hacks like Ayn Rand, is a theory of justice--of freedom articulated as justice, and not just as brand preference or the will to power.  Here's a useful summary:
All social primary goods - liberty and opportunity, income and wealth, and the bases of self-respect - are to be distributed equally unless an unequal distribution of any or all of these goods is to the advantage of the least favored.
much more here:

http://www.ohio.edu/people/piccard/entropy/rawls.html

Does this assume some means to guarantee the equal distribution of social goods to all?   Yes.  And interestingly enough, that is what differentiates conservatism (think Edmund Burke) and leftist thought on one side from liberal / neoliberal / libertarian thought on the other.  I mean to say that there are elements on the left and the right that agree on the fundamental problems with libertarian doctrine and practice, which goes right back to the poll that started this thread.  Speaking personally, I find it a lot easier to enjoy a conversation with a reader of William Buckley than a reader of Milton Friedman or a consumer of Atlas Shrugged.

Finally, on Nozick:  G.A. Cohen's persistent critiques of Nozick and other libertarian thinkers remain relevant, even twenty years later, because they haven't yet been adequately rebutted.  Start here if you're interested.

http://www.cambridge.org/US/academic/subjects/politics-international-relations/political-theory/self-ownership-freedom-and-equality

Malcolm wrote:
I think that characterizing Nozick, and for the matter Hayek, as "libertarians" is short-sighted. Certainly libertarians who have misread these two guys have held them up as influences.

Hayek's main bugaboo is the planned economy, and his main observation is that a planned economy cannot fairly predict all needs, and therefore, it becomes defacto unethical favoritism; whereas in an unplanned economy, the chips fall where they may lay. However, it is not the case that Hayek was completely opposed to regulation, social programs and so on.

Nozick, it seems, was not very interested in defending his book on any level. Rawls and he were good friends, and I suspect that in Nozick's case, ASU was an intellectual exercise rather than a intellectual commitment. One interesting outcome of his book however, is that he asserts in ASU that we do not have the right to slaughter animals, and he apparently was himself a vegetarian.

Jikan said:
I'd like to flesh out that previous post a bit further, because now that I read it, I see that it's written in academese and I don't want to cause confusion.

Here's a useful blog post by a capable thinker on some of the problems with how the concept of "freedom" is articulated in contemporary libertarian discourse vis a vis the state.

https://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.com/2012/07/fundamental-contradiction-of.html
As is well known, the core idea of libertarian philosophy is the preservation of the maximum amount of freedom possible. Though the concept seems, in practice, to be limited to the freedom of employers, we will give the libertarian the benefit of the doubt and assume he really does mean freedom for all; which is what immediately generates the fundamental and, as far as I can see, inescapable contradiction of the libertarian doctrine.

The crucial problem is that one simply cannot have freedom without limiting freedom. I know, it sounds like an oxymoron, but in fact libertarians themselves acknowledge its truth. Libertarians are not anarchists, and they understand that individual freedom is maximized only by the presence of a government that regulates the rules of engagement among people (otherwise we are back to a Hobbesian war of all against all). So, for instance, no libertarian would argue that the possibility of charges of murder are an impediment to your freedom to kill me. That’s because if you do kill me, my freedom is going to be (terminally, as it were) limited.

The same goes for your freedom to steel from me, obviously. So we already have two fundamental rights — to life and property — that do require government regulation, or our existence is going to be nasty, brutish, short and all the rest. Curiously, these also happen to be the only two kinds of freedom that libertarians acknowledge. But why? Our society recognizes additional freedoms that libertarians would find hard to object to in principle, and indeed, they strenuously defend when they perceive them to be threatened by government  action. Freedom of speech and of action (e.g., how, when and with whom to have sex), to name just a couple.

And that’s where the problem becomes obvious. Why, exactly, is it objectionable for the government to infringe on these liberties, but not for a private employer? In case you doubt — or, like most Americans, are simply unaware of — the fact that employers routinely do infringe in an entirely arbitrary manner on our personal freedom...
The rest of the post is very much worth reading.  For now, it suffices to point out that freedom is not equally distributed to all--far from it--and the state is not the reason why.  My employer articulates his freedom precisely by limiting and delimiting mine.  When a mayor or governor or Senator does that, I can mobilize the vote to get him or her out.  This is not typically possible in the workplace.  (and a kneejerk "get another job bozo!" is no counterargument to this.)

Put differently, "freedom" as defined by libertarians is often freedom's opposite.

I would like to know from our libertarian friends here at DW what they think freedom means in this context.  Again:  freedom for whom, and to do what?

it might also be worthwhile to explore the assumptions about the self in liberal / neoliberal / libertarian economic theory, and compare/contrast those with Buddhism 101.

To paraphrase someone who worked on it, "If you want a great action movie, go see it. If you want anything more - like a good story, for instance - forget it."


Malcolm wrote:
The fundamental story is the overthrow of a mercantilist patriarchal triumvirate, setting the stage for the rise of a matriarchal seed-saving society in the Wasteland.

Foremost, it is quest movie. Second of all, it is a chase movie. Third of all, it is an action film. Overall, it is another chapter in Miller's stunning post-apocalyptic vision. While nothing could ever recapture the sheer purity of the Road Warrior, this movie stands on its own in every way.

While there was no script, there was a story. The movie itself was composed in over 3000 story boards, making a huge graphic novel. Not only is there a story for every actor, a back story, which each actor was filled in on; every car, truck, town and so on was given a backstory upon which set was constructed and upon which the actors improvised their dialogue, as minimal as dialogue is in this film. If you know anything of theater history, you will remember Antonine Artaud's "Theatre of Cruelty" with it's emphasis on mise en scène.

Also, Miller very cleverly divided up the three things that characterize modern economics; oil, weapons and agriculture into three communities, i.e. Gastown, the Bullet Farm and the Citadel. As someone concerned with the environment, Kim, you should understand this movie is very much about environmentalism and the consequences of not treating our planet well.

The actual movie itself — a quest to find The Green Place, Furiosa's home, from which she was kidnapped — is only a very small part of a much bigger story.

Furiosa escapes with Immortal Joe's wives to find the green place. There is a tremendous chase, but Max and Furiosa (having become allies) succeed in escaping Immortal Joe and his allies by losing them in a swamp, called the Place of Crows. After discovering some old biker women, the Vulvalini, who had turned to banditry in the Waste Land to survive, they inform Furiosa that the Green Place of her childhood had become tainted and vanished, turning into the place where they had lost Immortal Joe and his army, the Place of Crows. You should understand that Furiosa and her mother had been kidnapped from the Vulvalini and the Green Place when she was a small child by Immortal Joe. The Vulvalini had saved seeds, their most precious possession. Furiosa and the Vulvalini decide to try and cross the salt flats to find a new green place, but with Max's encouragement, they realize that they have no idea what they will find 160 miles across the salt flats, so they turn around to take on Immortal Joe and his minions, eventually taking over the citadel itself.

That is the story.

Thank you, Dzogchungpa; I've read the article. By the way, it calls to mind a difference in point of view between CNNR and Trungpa Rinpoche: The former insisted that sgra bla was the proper Tibetan spelling of "drala", and ties it in with the principle of sound (in "Drung, De'u and Bon"). CTR, after Mipham, says it's dgra bla, meaning "above the enemy".

Most Bonpo books agree with CNNR, while in most Buddhist sources, its spelled a third way: dgra lha.

Anyway, if you want to believe that most Gesar bards were Dzogchenpas, feel free. I just introduced the idea so that people could know there is more than one school of thought about the hand-to-the-ear gesture.

I myself read the text in question, but unfortunately, I cannot pull up the page number now from google books. However, in The Role of Divine Grace in the Soteriology of Śaṃkarācārya, on page two my assertion is confirmed. Moreover, Ingalls notes:

Unknown said:
The dates A.D. 788-820, which have been widely accepted for `Sa^mkara in the past, must be pushed back. A detailed and scholarly treatment of the subject will be found in the first volume of Hajime Nakamura's Japanese work Shooki no Vedaanta Tetsugaku (Tokyo: Iwanami Shoten, 1950), pp 63-121. The early limit for `Sa^mkara is the date of Dharmakiirti, whom `Sa^mkara quotes in the Upade`sa-saahasrii, K.r.s.na `Saastrii Navare, ed. (Bombay: Jagadishvara Press, 1886), XVIII.142. Dharmakiirti rose to fame between the visits to India of Hsuan Tsang and I Ching, that is, between A.D. 634 and 673. The later limit is given by two sets of facts. (A) `Sa^mkara's pupil Sure`svara is quoted by Vidyaananda, who must have lived slightly before A.D. 800. See Pathak in "Bhart.rhari and Kumaarila," Journal of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, XVIII (1894), 225-229. (B) There must be at least two generations between `Sa^mkara and Vaacaspati Mi`sra, who wrote the Nyaaya-suucii-nibandha in A.D. 841. The generations, on Nakamura's showing (op. cit., p. 89 and p. 98, note 12), are: `Sa^mkara, `Sriivatsaa^nka. Bhaaskara, Vaacaspati. Nakamura bases this at least in part on Yamuna's Siddhi-traya. Chowkhamba Snaskrit Series Work No. 10(Benares: Chowkhamba Sanskrit Book Depot, 1900), p. 6. One can prove the same result perhaps more surely by taking the following sequence: `Sa^mkara, Padmapaada, and Sure`svara, Bhaaskara, Vaacaspati. For evidence that Bhaaskara is later than `Sa^mkara's pupils Padmapaada and Sure`svara, see note 4 below.

So, I gotta to stick to my guns. We know for a fact that Śāntarakṣita was present in Tibet by 773, Frauwallner gives Śāntarakṣita's dates as 725-788, and we know he spent the last fifteen years of his life in Tibet. Kamalaśīla (fl. 740–795) accompanied him. It is extremely likely then that the Tattvasamgraha commentary was composed in Tibet, if not the original text.


David Reigle said:
Śāntarakṣita devoted verses 171-327 of his Tattva-saṃgraha to a critique of a permanent, personal ātman held by five different Indian schools, typically an ātman that is a kartṛ, “doer,” and/or a bhoktṛ, “experiencer.” When he arrived at the Advaita [Vedānta] idea of the universal or non-dual ātman, his comments were few (verses 328-335), and respectful. Even there, the ātman that he refuted was the jñāna/vijñāna-ātman, a cognizer that is permanent, not the parama-ātman that Śaṅkarācārya would later teach. .

Malcolm wrote:
H. Nakamura holds that Śaṅkarācārya is earlier than Śāntarakṣita, that is, prior to 750 CE.

As far as your other statement goes, 1) Kamashila specifically identifies this as the position of the Advaitans [གཉིས་མེད་པར་ལྟ་བ], followers of the Upanishads [གསང་བ་པ་རྣམས], i.e. Vedantins.

There is no substantial difference with what is presented here and Śaṅkarā's thought:
Dakshinamurti-Stotra-With-Manasollasa.tiff
15. Consciousness is of two kinds: Nirvikalpaka or the
undifferentiated consciousness illumines the Thing itself,
while Savikalpa or the differentiated consciousness is
manifold as illumining the designations, etc.
http://sacred-texts.com/hin/dast/index.htm

Therefore, when Śāntarakṣita says their error is slight, he actually is saying their error is huge for proposing that consciousness, something impermanent, is permanent.

One can hardly read this text as any thing other than  refutation of the parama-ātma postulated by Śaṅkarā.

David Reigle said:

I do not want to seem like an ungrateful guest to his hosts, or to seem like I am arguing. At the same time, I feel a certain responsibility to Hajime Nakamura. So I will merely make the following statement and bow out, hoping that it will not be inappropriate here.

Hajime Nakamura regarded Śāntarakṣita as prior to Śaṅkarācārya. In his book, A History of Early Vedānta Philosophy, in the section on The Vedanta Philosophy Reported by Śāntarakṣita and Kamalaśīla, pp. 221-257, he gives considerable evidence showing this.

I know much of this history is shrouded in mystery, and may be laden with sectarian commitments, but I'm putting the question forward anyway with the hope that everyone may benefit from it.

What do we know of the historical relation of Dzogchen and Mahamudra before, say, the time of Milarepa?  I've heard conflicting claims on Milarepa specifically--that he was simultaneously a Mahamudra practitioner and a Dzogchenpa, or that he practiced Mahamudra but that Mahamudra itself has its origins in Dzogchen Semde, or that the Milarepa's realization of Mahamudra simply makes sense to Dzogchenpas while having nothing concrete to do with Dzogchen as such.  (These are not authoritative positions, merely things I've heard in conversation over the years.)

I assume Milarepa is a significant figure in his own right, of course, but also that these conflicting claims are representative of broader claims and convictions on the historical relation of Mahamudra and Dzogchen.

DharmaWheel, please help me make sense of this.  Thank you.

As far as Longde goes, well, Dzeng Dharmabodhi lived in Lhodrak and had close connections with Kagyus living in that region. In terms of the famous posture of Milarepa, it could either be a Longde posture or the position used in the practice called "vajra waves."

Just as someone claims "a gem made of metal resembles a precious gem", though it's surface is polished, that cannot withstand burning, scratching, grinding and so on. Since they are completely different, whoever is skilled in recognizing precious gems will generate the perception of which is precious. In the same way, since [the tīrthika position of] self, permanence, all pervasivness and oneness contradict their opposite, [the Buddhist position of] no-self, impermanence, non-pervasiveness and multiplicity, they are completely different; the one who is skilled in recognizing reality generates the perception of which is reality. Therefore, it is like showing the tail of the deer to sell horse meat.
In other words, what Bhavaviveka is saying that the Advaitans fraudulently misrepresent the teaching of the Buddha, and worse, cast it to mean the opposite of what it actually means, using the example of a merchant who displays something of high value to pass off something of no value.

David Reigle said:
Thanks, Malcolm, for posting this criticism of Vedānta made by Bhavya. These criticisms are frequent in his text, and it is important for us to see an example of one. Just as Bhavya is straightforward in his criticisms of the Vedānta of his time, so he is fair in seeing what is good in it. A few verses after the ones I referred to in his Vedānta chapter, he writes, addressing the Vedāntins (verse 95, Lindtner Sanskrit edition): “If an ātman of such kind is also intended by you, sirs, there is no fault, because of the many similarities of name, etc. It is logically acceptable.” Bhavya is here referring to an ātman that is beyond thought and speech. Then, a few verses later, he says that an ātman is not tenable, because ātman and anātman are opposites (verses 100-101). Here, however, he specifies the ātman as a doer and an experiencer. So we have to be aware of what ātman he is referring to in any given statement. He does not make a blanket denial of the ātman.

Malcolm wrote:
This is not a statement of acceptability. He is taunting the tīrthikas for being afraid. He says in the commentary:
Just as whatever is shown by the term "nonarising" (including its reasoning) will be free from fault, also if you assert [such] a self, the dispute will about a mere name. What conflict will there be with your so called "supreme self" and our "nonarising?"
But he immediately says:
Those terrified of selflessness still dwell in it even though they are terrified;
just as those who are terrified of space have no other place to dwell.
You can see very clearly he really thinks these tīrthikas are idiots for he says in the commentary:
Just as some fools are terrified of and frightened by space, they dwell in that space since no other place is seen [in which to dwell]. In the same way, also those terrified by selflessness, are supported on and dwell in that selflessness because there is no support other than that.
Honestly, it is really too much to believe that Bhavaviveka has a positive attitude towards these people. He thinks they are both frauds and fools.

He is basically saying, contrary to your perspective, that by adopting the two truths and adopting the terminology of nonarising, Advaitans are merely arguing themselves into a ridiculous corner where they have no choice but to abandon their concept of para atman. It is not we who are adopting their self, it is they who are adopting our reasoning about the two truths. This is why he earlier castigates them for stealing the teachings of the Tathāgatas and claiming it for themselves.

Śāntarakṣita devoted verses 171-327 of his Tattva-saṃgraha to a critique of a permanent, personal ātman held by five different Indian schools, typically an ātman that is a kartṛ, “doer,” and/or a bhoktṛ, “experiencer.” When he arrived at the Advaita [Vedānta] idea of the universal or non-dual ātman, his comments were few (verses 328-335), and respectful. Even there, the ātman that he refuted was the jñāna/vijñāna-ātman, a cognizer that is permanent, not the parama-ātman that Śaṅkarācārya would later teach. .

Malcolm wrote:
H. Nakamura holds that Śaṅkarācārya is earlier than Śāntarakṣita, that is, prior to 750 CE.

As far as your other statement goes, 1) Kamashila specifically identifies this as the position of the Advaitans [གཉིས་མེད་པར་ལྟ་བ], followers of the Upanishads [གསང་བ་པ་རྣམས], i.e. Vedantins.

There is no substantial difference with what is presented here and Śaṅkarā's thought:
Dakshinamurti-Stotra-With-Manasollasa.tiff (66.63 KiB) Viewed 3662 times
15. Consciousness is of two kinds: Nirvikalpaka or the
undifferentiated consciousness illumines the Thing itself,
while Savikalpa or the differentiated consciousness is
manifold as illumining the designations, etc.
http://sacred-texts.com/hin/dast/index.htm

Therefore, when Śāntarakṣita says their error is slight, he actually is saying their error is huge for proposing that consciousness, something impermanent, is permanent.

One can hardly read this text as any thing other than  refutation of the parama-ātma postulated by Śaṅkarā.

There are a bunch of images and mantras and sutras that say you will be free of the lower realms forever just because you've seen or heard them. Does this really mean that if you hear Medicine Buddha's name or look at one of those little red and gold cards, you could become a serial killer and still never be reborn in the lower realms? If these things are really so powerful, you would think that everyone who has so much as heard HH The Dalai Lama's name or the mani mantra will never be reborn in the lower realms—a very large percentage of the Earth's population.

Is it really that easy to never be reborn in the lower realms? If it is, it would follow that every teaching about the lower realms is just a skillful means for generating compassion toward beings not of this world. You could chant the Akshobhya mantra to somebody, murder them, and rest assured that neither of you will suffer in the lower realms and always move toward Buddhahood.

Urgyen Dorje said:
The phenomenon of nazism, in itself, really illustrates how tired and limited this right-left dicotomy is.

If you read Mein Kampf, Hitler simultaneously attacks both right wing and left wing political ideologies. He asserts that capitalism has run its course, and holds that capitalism damages nationalism because of international finances and the egotism inherent in capitalism.  The national socialism created to support this was also anti-communist, as Marxist communism was not only seen as a Jewish creation, but because it threatened the middle class and eliminated prive property.

The economics of Nazism falls off the right-left capitalism-communism continuua, because it's rooted in different values.  It aimed to create an alternative to both freemarket capitalism and Marixst communism through something akin to a proleteriat revolution, the revolution of the Volksgemeinschaft, the people's commuity, which had a racial and nationalistic identity. But it was also against the concept of class struggle, which has an inherent value of class equality.  So in many ways it' is very socialist in feel.

On the flip side, the anticapitalist vibe of this national socialism alienated industrialists who were central to the nationalist project of war in Europe, so Hitler made any number of quid pro quo's with them.  While Hitler's Nazism theoretically was pro-merchantile while being anti-multinational corp, companies such as Krups, VW, Siemens, were left unmolested as long as they supported the party and the war.

So sure, we can put a pin in a chart and identify Hitler as far right, but on other continuua, we could identify him as right, left, middle, or N/A and off the continuum.

In my mid it's important to put him off these right-left capitalist-communism continuua because of the value systems involved.  Here is an economic system that is, at least nominally, based on values other than the production and distribution of capital.  There is a hiddeous and grotesque nationalistic and racial project at hand as well.

I think this is important to look at that, as other economic models based on more than just capital are thus possible.  Instead of grotesque nationalistic and racist interests, there could be environmental interests or what not.

Actually, sometimes "kyi" does not function as a genitive in the sense that we understand it in Latinate grammatical terminology. Here it does not, it sets off a clause.

Anyway, here 'od gsal is not a gloss for clarity anymore than bde chen is a gloss for bde ba.

It is a play on words.

The normal sequence is bde ba, gsal ba, mi rtog pa, not bde chen, 'od 'gsal, mi rtog pa.

Bde chen, great bliss, is something at the ulimate level, just like 'od gsal, not the level of transient experience like simple bde ba. And mi rtog pa can be either.

From the above link.


This work is a three-dimensional mandala, or cosmic diagram, of Hevajra, who is the chief deity of the Tantric (Vajrayana) Buddhist path to enlightenment. Unlike Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism, the Tantric school believed that, with serious application and the guidance of a religious teacher, an initiate could achieve enlightenment in this life. The main exercise was meditation. While meditating, the practitioner focused all his mental energy on a deity, in this case Hevajra, thereby transferring to himself the characteristics of the deity. The cult of Hevajra flourished in Cambodia between the tenth and thirteenth centuries. Here Hevajra stands in the centre on an eight-petalled lotus surrounded by dakhinis, minor female divinities in Tantric Buddhism, and one unidentified other figure.

Malcolm wrote:
The first has no underlying Sanskrit term. But in simple terms it means the imputation of something as real, a fact, and so on, a conventionality because in our everyday perception world this or that seems to function properly. As Madhyamakas, we accept what people say about the world as long as that is not analyzed. We define relative truth fundamentally as a the object of a pre-analytic perception. Ultimate truth, at least the nominal ultimate, is an object of a post-analytic perception, in other words, whatever remains in our perception after analysis is taken to be true, real, irreducible and ultimate.

Dependent or extrinsic existence (parabhāva) is defined by Nāgārjuna as a species of svabhāva, a deferred svabhāva. Nāgārjuna is observing that there no existence (bhāva) not included in either svabh̄ava or parabhāva. That being the case, when inherent existence is not established, neither is existence and nonexistence.

One cannot find they are 'real' in the sense implicit in the debate in Indian philosophy. That isn't 'cultural relativism': it is an observation about the background of the debate, the broader 'theory of meaning' that underlies the question itself. But in the modern context, the many discoveries about the nature of matter (like for instance discovery of the periodic table) are discoveries about things and principles that exist. I can't see the point in denying that.
These are no less conventions than the atoms perceived by ancient yogis in their meditation.


Unknown said:
But then, I agree in the sense that material phenomena have been shown to have no irreducible component or basis.  That is why the search for the 'atom' has developed into speculation on parallel worlds and the like. So I understand how phenomena are not ultimately real, i.e. empty of own-being, groundless, dependent. I think I get that. But I think you can recognize the emptiness of phenomena without saying they are utterly unreal.

Malcolm wrote:
If phenomena are not ultimately real, they are not real. There are no gradations of real, unreal, somewhat real, more real than not real, and so on. Things are either real or they are not. The only kind of reality things may be said to have is a reality dependent on conventional designation, and that is all, and when those conventional designations are examined they are found to be baseless, and therefore, the reality of that which they designate evaporates like dew hit by sunlight.

No one has said that we are confronted with the unreality of phenomena at the get go. No one says that we should be content to merely say "Everything is unreal" and leave it at the level of concept. One must discover the unreality of phenomena. I would suggest that in your case, you have not extended your analysis far enough.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, there is really no such thing as an immortal nirmanakayā because the rūpakāya always arises out of the dharmakāya, and therefore, the issue of mortal/immortal never arises for a buddha. If you can achieve buddhahood by a given path, then you realize dharmakāya, and if you realize dharmakāya, you can always generate rūpakāya, which you do so in response to the needs of sentient beings.

Tenso said:
When the body transforms into the five wisdom lights aka rainbow body, you are saying that it is the dharmakaya that is generating a rupakaya? I've read somewhere that the rainbow body is already present in each and every sentient being so would using the word "generate" be an incorrect word to use?  How do you "generate" something that is already there?

An existing thing does not arise, nor does a nonexisting thing, nor does something both existing and nonexisting.
There is no arising from self, nor from other; without both how can there be arising?
It is reasonable for an existent to exist, but it is not reasonable for it to perish. 
Since it is reasonable that a nonexistent does not exist, it will never perish. 
It is not reasonable that there is a result from some perished cause,
and there is [no result] from [a cause] that has not perished, therefore, you [the Buddha] have asserted that arising is like a dream.

There is the acquisition of the solace of "I abide in the knowledge of the middle way inseparable with extremes. I will also place others in the knowledge of middle way inseparable with the extremes. In that regard, the middle way inseparable with extremes is that which is the nature of the extremes because there is no other middle way apart from the nature of the extremes.

I will also place others in the knowledge of space inseparable with the nonbeing of space. In that regard, space inseparable with the nonbeing of space is that which is the nature of the nonbeing of space.

Since there is no space apart from the nature of the nonbeing of space, the nature of the nonbeing of space itself is space. Since one knows space of the nature of nonbeing of space, all phenomena are like space."

There is the acquisition of the solace of "I abide in the knowledge of the child of a barren woman inseparable with the nonbeing of the child of a barren women. I will also place others in the knowledge of the child of a barren woman inseparable with the nonbeing of the child of a barren women. In that regard, the child of a barren woman inseparable with the nonbeing of the child of a barren women is that which is the nature of the nonbeing of child of a barren women.

There is the acquisition of the solace of "I abide in the knowledge of a mirage inseparable with the nonbeing of the mirage.

You can say that things are "conventionally real", but this does not help you. Why? Because once again, "conventionally real" amounts to nothing more than the assertion that something is "real" because two sentient beings beings agree on the identity of a shared appearance. And that also does not match now the term is used in English. "Real" in the OED means, "...actually existing as a thing or occurring in fact; not imagined or supposed" or as it is used in Philosophy, "...relating to something as it is, not merely as it may be described or distinguished."

In reality, a thing that is a conventional truth is true only in so far as it is functional. For, there is no "car" in a car. We use a number of parts, assemble them and create something we call a "car", using those parts to perform a function. But when we analyze those parts, we can find no car in them, nor separate from them. The "car" as such does not exist apart from our imputation of a car upon some parts, just as there is no person in the aggregates or separate from them. "Car" and "Malcolm" are imputations of an on a collection of parts and have no reality other than as an imputation. This means that the reality of cars and malcolm's is strictly conventional.

This why conventional truths are relative truths, "concealer truths" if we follow the etymology of samvṛtti, because their real nature is concealed by our deluded perceptions of things.

Malcolm wrote:
To a suffering being - that's all of us, to all intents - you can't simply say 'look here, your suffering is really the result of deluded cognitions'.
But that is precisely the point of the Buddha's teaching, in toto: i.e., one's suffering is a result of deluded cognitions.

Unknown said:
Now, it might actually be the result of deluded cognition - but to overcome this state of delusion is the point of the entire Buddhist teaching. That is why there is a path in the first place, so to deny that there is suffering, comes perilously close to denying the first truth of Buddhism.

Malcolm wrote:
I no more deny there is suffering than there is an appearance of illusion. I merely pointed out that neither are real.

So I object that to say 'something is real' is to say it is has ultimate or inherent existence, or, in other words, that only the ultimate is real and that phenomena are unreal.

Malcolm wrote:
But that is precisely the point of Nāgārjuna's statement that existents must be included in either inherent exisence or dependent existence. If inherent existence is established, then existents are established.

Every phenomenon can be understood as a result of causes and conditions, and in that sense, it has no inherent reality; that is the ground of the identity of Śūnyatā and dependent origination.  But it is real in an empirical sense, even if not an ultimate sense.

Malcolm wrote:
It is meaningless to say something is real in anything other than an ultimate sense.

Unknown said:
It is the reality of the existence for us unenlightened beings.

But that doesn't say they're non-existent, and to say that they are non-existent is nihilistic.

Malcolm wrote:
Madhyamaka indeed removes claims that existents exist. It is not annihilationist because Madhyamaka does not propose the existence of something to become non-existent. Your assertion of nihilism is unwarranted and out of place. I could care less what old fascist philosophers like Heidegger have to say about anything.

As far as 'deluded cognition' is concerned, an apple is still an apple, whether for the sage or for the ordinary worldly being.

I don't think so. For example, take the example of a liquid in the six realms, it is water for a human is molten iron for a hell being, pus and blood for a preta, nectar for a deva, etc. For a human being the perception of water is conventionally true, perception of molten iron, and so on are conventionally false . It is equally so in the rest of the six realms, for example, a hell being's perception of molten iron is conventionally true in the hell realms, but the perception of water in that realm conventionally would be delusion.

Right, I am employing those arguments within the context of a tradition to which I am an actual heir, having been trained in those arguments in the traditional manner.

I'm actually interested in philosophy, Buddhist and otherwise, as a practical skill, and that has to accept the fact that suffering, objects of cognition, and the rest, do exist, even whilst they're ultimately empty.

Relatives truths are objects of false cognitions. They are identified as such so that one will known how to discern ultimate truth, the understanding and realization of which leads to nirvana.

srivijaya said:
Hi Malcolm,
I see that you place emphasis on the deluded cognition here, rather than the object. Still, Wayfarer has a valid point. The Mahayana proposition rests on the revelation that such deluded cognitions perceive objects as existing inherently, whereas they are in fact empty (Two Truths). Direct experience of this is essential for liberation. If you remove this, then the whole premise is undermined wouldn't you say?

Malcolm wrote:
Truths are cognitions of objects, so yes, the emphasis is on the cognition, nevertheless, the definition is incomplete without including the object.

For example, a mirage is the object of a deluded cognition of the presence of water in the distance. The perceived object does not exist, and yet it still appears; when that appearance of investigated, no water is found which corresponds to that appearance.

"...such deluded cognitions perceive objects as existing inherently, whereas they are in fact empty..."

Such a distinction is not made by a worldly person. Worldly people do not think in terms of "inherent existence."

The problem with Wayfarer's perspective is that he believes that there is something in phenomena that can survive analysis, which he calls "mere existence." In reality, nothing can survive ultimate analysis, not even buddhahood.

Relatives truths are by definition cognitions of objects which have not been subjected to ultimate analysis. The cognition of any object which can survive ultimate analysis is an ultimate truth.

The real point is that whatever arises from causes and conditions is cannot survive ultimate analysis. For example, in the Hinayāna presentation of two truths the cognition of a vase is relative truth; when this is shattered with a hammer, the cognition of the shards and so on are ultimate truths. Likewise, the cognition of water is a relative truth; but the cognition of coolness, wetness and limpidity are ultimate truths.

When this is brought to the level of Madhyamaka, we can see that all things that arise from cause and conditions are equivalent with mirages, dreams, illusions and so on. Just as in a puppet show a bunch of rocks, sticks and paper is made to appear as elephants, warriors and so on through the "mantra" of the illusionist (meaning his narrative), likewise are phenomena appearing through causes and conditions. So too when the it is understood that the illusion is a mere spell cast through skilled manipulation of bits and pieces of rocks, wood, string and so on, one understands that the illusion are unreal, and phenomena are also like this. When the basis of the illusions are investigated, they too are found to arise from causes and conditions and therefore are essentially unreal. There is no end to such analysis because there is no end to deceptive appearances.

I can't continue since I have to go out of town for a day or so, but I will leave you with this: whatever arises from causes and conditions does not exist in those causes and conditions nor separate from them, just as a self does not exist in the aggregates nor separate from them. Nevertheless, just as things are designated dependent on causes and conditions without really being there, selves are designated dependent on the aggregates without really being there.

Gorampa for example, critiques in detail the subtle nihilism present in the Gelugpa view that you follow, as does Mipham. You should read them both.

I think the argument is that since all negations are nominal whether affirming or non-affirming it is just as legitimate to nominally affirm the ultimate as it is to negate.

Otherwise we are just stuck on the first of Nagarjuna's extreme's, i.e. not-x. I think smcj is just arguing the second extreme, i.e. not not-x.

Malcolm wrote:
I am not stuck on the first extreme, I am not asserting non-existence is the ultimate. The point is that absence of the four extremes, which is ultimate, is not arrived at through a mere assertion, it is arrived at through examination. It is a conclusion, a result of analysis, not a hypothesis about the ultimate (unlike smcj's perspective, which is just a proposition, an proffered theory). It is not an idea you hold in your mind, "Oh the ultimate is free from four extremes." Why? Because when you turn your analysis to the ultimate, no ultimate can be found which is itself free from the four extremes. At the point, your proliferations should cease. As Sapan famously quips, "If there is something beyond the freedom from extremes, that is an extreme."

Karma Dondrup Tashi said:
If you argue that there is nothing established to either affirm or negate in the first place then that argues both ways - you may as well state that nominally the negation is affirming as non-affirming.

Otherwise the whole strategy of the four extremes falls down, since all of them are negations. Since the four extremes are negations there has to - at least nominally - be something to negate. If that isn't the case, Nagarjuna's whole argument goes out the window and you are left with pure nihilism.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, there is nominally something to negate, appearances. Nāgārjuna's arguments run in three phases: first, self-arising is negated; then, arising from others is negated; and finally causeless negation is negated. Of these three types of arising, the second is what we conventionally term "arising."

This is why, at the conclusion of the first chapter, Buddhapalita notes:
Because results, conditions, and nonconditions do not exist, descriptions for arising are merely conventional.

Suchness is not established. The Ārya-varmavyūhanirdeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

Since there is no place to abandon,
it is unmoving.
The suchness of the dharmadhātu,
it's natural purity, does not exist.
In the same vein, the Mahāsiddha Virupa concludes his Doha:
...the two truths don’t exist in the dharmadhātu, the dharmadhātu does not exist.
Indeed, the Ārya-ghanavyūha-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra says:
The suchness of all phenomena
arises through power of mutual relation,
the yogins seeing in that way
clearly see it as suchness. 
The perfected nature 
is the dharmatā of phenomena;
all phenomena do not arise
as the substantial entities of the imputed:
empty, insubstantial,
beyond the the extremes of existence and nonexistence, 
similar with illusions and dreams,
like fairy castles,
like opthalmia and like mirages.
In other words, suchness, here described as the perfected nature, the dharmatā of dharmas, cannot be established apart from those very dharmas. If those very dharmas are not established, how can their suchness be established? When the relative is not found, what ultimate can be said to be established? The two truths are only established from the perspective of we ignorant fools.

This tendency to reify the ultimate is very pernicious. For this reason, Nāgārjuna clear states in the Sixty Verses of Reasoning:
This pair, samsara and nirvana, does not exist.
Thorough knowledge of samsara is said to be nirvana.

When it comes to the use of the term "real," it is not possible to say that the real can become unreal — these are contradictions in terms. On the other hand, it is perfectly acceptable in common language to say "That which existed then no longer exists now."

As I said, many claim that Buddhism is nihilistic. Do you think it is? If it isn't, how isn't it?

Malcolm wrote:
I already stated this before: when one does not propose something as existent, one cannot be accused of being an annihilationist. I have not proposed any claims of non-existent, I have merely removed claims for existing existents, as Buddhapalita remarks in his comments on chapter 5 of the MMK
We do not claim aggregates, sense bases and elements are nonexistent, but we do eliminate the claim that existents exists.
He also remarks at the end of chapter five:
In order to prove an unknown topic with a known topic: most worldly people say that space does not exist in any way. Thus, partisans claim "All of those proliferations are like space." The intent of such as statement is "All of those are nothing at all." For that reason, it is proven that space is emptiness in order to elucidate the example, "The remaining five elements [dhātus] are equivalent with space."
In other words, in MMK:5 (the analysis of the dhātus), of the six dhātus — earth, water, fire, air, space and consciousness — only space is actually subject to analysis. Why? Since Nāgārjuna shows:
Therefor space is not existent,
it is not non-existent, is not the characterized,
is not a characteristic.
The remaining five elements [dhātus] are equivalent with space
Buddhapalita discusses this passage:
Why is that so? When investigated, the characterized and the characteristic does not exist, and also there is no other existent not included in the characterized and the characteristic. If the existent does not exist, also the non-existent does not exist. Therefor, although space is not existent, it is also not non-existent, although the characterized does not exist, also the characteristic does not exist. Thus, if even a subtle thing called ‘space’ came to be, when counting whether anything in those four [alternatives] is valid, because those four [alternatives] are not [valid], therefor space does not exist.
For this reason, characterizing the Madhyamaka position that "there is no reality" as annihilationist is inappropriate.

Malcolm wrote:
In order to the statement "no reality" to be annihilationist, it would be necessary to propose that there was something that was real. For example, Nāgārjuna states very clearly:
If were anything all that was not empty, there would something to be empty;
but since there is nothing at all that is not empty, where is there something to be empty?

Wayfarer said:
My view is, I think there is 'an ultimate', but that this is not something that can properly be named or designated as such. So as soon as you assert 'an ultimate' and get into a debate about it, it's already a lost argument, because you're trying to talk about or gesture towards something that is over the horizon of discursive reasoning. But I don't accept the interpretation of Śūnyatā as meaning that 'things really don't exist', tout courte. Things are empty of own-being, meaning that no determinate entity contains its own origin or cause, and in fact nothing in the phenonenal realm does. That is demonstrably true, even in scientific terms. But it *doesn't* mean, 'nothing is real'.

Malcolm wrote:
You have just shunted off inherent existence onto something else, a so called dependent existence, which is refuted quite handily by Nāgārjuna in the chapter 15 of the MMK.

In other words, your view holds that things are real. But how? In what way can things exist? You propose things are not self-sufficient, but when examined, even this dependency cannot be found. Why? Causes do not exist at the same time as their effects, but they also cannot exist apart from the time of their effects. As Nāgārjuna states:
Existents do not arise from existents, 
existents do not arise from non-existents;
nonexistents do not arise from existents,
nonexistents do not arise from nonexistents:
where then is there arising?
In the end, so called "mere existence" is just a convention, and is not real since such conventions will not bear analysis. If you imagine that there are some existents that can bear analysis, you have not really understood the Buddha's intention.

Since the Shentong position is that the ultimate is beyond conceptuality, and therefore not subject to such criticisms, I have absolutely no qualms about it being incoherent. This approach to emptiness is not supposed to be accessible by the intellect, but is approached instead by faith.

Malcolm wrote:
The point is, that one cannot say anything about the ultimate that is free from extremes, much less assert that it is immune to Madhyamaka analysis. The moment you make a proposition about the ultimate, you have fallen into an extreme. If you claim the ultimate is atman, that is an extreme; if you claim the ultimate is a nonaffirming negation, that is an extreme; if you claim the ultimate is an affirming negation, that is an extreme.

When you understand that the ultimate is free from all extremes, then you understand that it is not only beyond mind, it is also inexpressible. The problem with the gzhan stong pas as well as the Gelugpas is that they sound like a couple of kids bickering, "Is so!", "Is not!", ad nauseam.

Since nothing can be found to exist by any of the four extremes in the relative, nothing can be ascertained in the ultimate according to any of the four extremes, and that is inexpressible.

Gzhan stong is a Tibetan attempt, of several, to try and reconcile the Yogacara treatises of Maitreyanatha with Nāgārjuna's Madhyamaka.

It is not the case that this type of reconciliation was not attempted by Indians, it was, notably in Ratnakārashanti's Madhamaka-alaṃkara.

The problem is how the Tibetans in the gzhan stong school went about it, not that they tried it. Ratnakārashanti, Dharmapāla before him, also tried to reconcile the two approaches, but they did not do so by overwriting the Yogacara treatises themselves. They did so within the constraints of the classical Yogacara system. What I specifically find fault with in the gzhan stong system is the incorrect way they apply the three natures to the two truths, that is really the essence of my disagreement with their tenet system and what causes them all the problems they face with other Tibetan scholars. Longchenpa does not do this, and this is why his treatment of tathāgatagarbha is generally considered more acceptable overall, as is Rangjung Dorje's.

1) taught an unborn, undying knower

Malcolm wrote:
Like Kapila, Buddha was a pluralist, accepting that "knowers" were unique and separate. Unlike Kapila, he did not that teach that there was a purusha separate from the aggregates; further he rejected the idea that phenomena were transformations of a single substance (prakriti), and likewise rejected the idea that there was one universal knower.

or alayavijnana or bhavanga citta, which is very similar to the Advaita atman?
How is the ālayavijñā, the bearer of karmic imprints (vasanas, bijas), something conditioned and contaminated, similar to the Advaita atman, something unconditioned and uncontaminated?

So the Buddha did not refute the transcendental Atman-Brahman, only the caricatured thumb sized, reified Atman spoken of by some but not all the Upanishads, and certainly not as later developed by Gaudapada and Shankara. So for example, the Chandyoga Chapter 14:
2—3. He who consists of the mind, whose body is subtle, whose form is light, whose thoughts are true, whose nature is like the akasa, whose creation in this universe, who cherishes all righteous desires, who contains all pleasant odours, who is endowed with all tastes, who embraces all this, who never speaks and who is without longing— He is my Self within the heart, smaller than a grain of rice, smaller than a grain of barley, smaller than a mustard seed, smaller than a grain of millet; He is my Self within the heart, greater than the earth, greater than the mid—region, greater than heaven, greater than all these worlds.

Conceptually, this is not different than, for example, the role that the heart plays in togal teachings in dzogchen:
Unknown said:
Although rigpa is not actually localized, many practitioners can most easily recognize it through a connection to the heart center. The Six Lamps specifically discusses this in terms of the space inside the physical heart. Westerners often find this strange, but it's similar to what we mean when we say that "in" each being is the nature of mind. The nature of mind is not individual and not localized. It is truer to say that we exist in the nature of mind than to say the nature of mind is in us. But in our experience it is easier to recognize the nature of mind if we go "in" to the deepest place in ourselves, the heart. This is why we say that the rigpa resides in the heart, and why the heart is the center of the life-force prana and why love is always connected to the heart. Thus we talk about the "light of the heart".

Malcolm wrote:
This thumb-sized self is refuted in the Dzogchen tantras as well.

With regard to TW's concepts around so called "khyab rig", this has been extensively refuted by John Luc Achard.

True. Kamaleswar Bhattacharya’s thesis has two parts: (1) that the Buddha did not deny the universal ātman; (2) that in denying the ātman in a person the Buddha thereby indirectly affirmed the universal ātman. The first part is, I think, demonstrable. Pali scholars agree that the Buddha does not specifically deny the existence of the attā anywhere in the Pāli canon, nor do the Sanskrit Buddhist texts deny the non-dual universal ātman. The second part is not demonstrable, on the basis of the great majority of Buddhist texts. It is so only if we accept the tathāgata-garbha sūtras that teach the perfection of ātman (ātma-pāramitā), and accept that these represent the Buddha’s final teachings, as the Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra represents itself to be.

Malcolm wrote:
No, this is not certain. Again, you would be projecting backward, asserting that intention of the Buddha in the  Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra is commensurate with Śaṅkarācārya's intention 1200 years later, or 700 years later if you assume the sūtra was composed in the first century CE.

I don't think that Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra teaches a universal atman of the type Śaṅkarācārya advocates. I think it is impossible to demonstrate that it does.

Sure, it is necessary for understanding much of Vajrayāna thinking around these issues. It is perhaps one of the most important theoretical commentaries on Vajrayāna, and its influence is much more widespread than the Arya tradition of Guhyasamaja.

It is not actually a very common term in the sūtras, occurring in only three sūtras in the bka' 'gyur.

For example the term occurs only once in the whole the Prajñāpāramitā corpus, in the Ārya-candragarbha-prajñāpāramitā-mahāyāna-sūtra:
Son of a good family, in that respect, the inexhaustible perfection of discerning wisdom is the nonconceptual wisdom of the of path of seeing. Because that wisdom is free from all concepts, it is therefore nonconceptual.
It also occurs in the Ārya-avikalpa-praveśa-nāma-dhāraṇī and the Ārya-gośṛṅgavyākaraṇa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra.

By contrast, it occurs in six tantras. Anyway, this is a besides the point. The real point is that the wisdom of bodhisattvas for example, cannot perceive tathāgatagarbha, even tenth stage bodhisattvas perceive only a generic approximation of it. The difference between the nonconceptual wisdom of bodhisattvas of one stage and another, as well as buddhas, is the degree to which they have developed sarvakārajñāna.

When it comes to the difference between minds in sūtra and tantra, there are no means taught in the sūtras to quell coarse minds. For example, Caryāmelāpakapradīpa points out:
As such, the Mahāyāna sūtras explain that the nature of consciousness that is without color, signs or shape is self-knowing wisdom. On the other hand, without entering the mahāyoga tantras of Vajrayāna, such as Guhyasamaja and so on, one will not be able to understand one's mind just as it truly for all the eons equal with the sands of the Ganges river and will not see relative truth. Therefore, one may know just how the three consciousness truly are from the kindness of the guru through following the Śrī Jñānavajrasammucaya tantra.
If you wish to understand more about the distinction between the coarse mind taught in sūtra, and the subtle mind taught in the tantras, you should study Āryadeva's Lamp that Integrates the Practices, Wedemeyer, Columbia, 2007.

This, incidentally, is among the reasons sūtrayāna takes so damn long, i.e., outside of Vajrayāna, there are no methods access the most subtle mind and use it in practice. That at least is the point of view of Vajrayāna.

“Mañjuśrī, how does a bodhisattva practice within the conduct of a bodhisattva? [F.298.b] Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva does not think of destruction, arising, non-destruction, non-arising, and the utter destruction of destruction; nor is he disturbed by utter non-arising. It is in this way, Mañjuśrī, that he practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva. Furthermore, Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva does not practice by thinking, ‘The past mind is destroyed;’ he does not practice by thinking, ‘The future mind has yet to be obtained;’ he does not practice by thinking, ‘The present mind abides.’ He is not stuck in the past, future, or present mind. As he practices in this way, Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva. [136]

“Mañjuśrī, giving, awakening, and sentient beings and, on the other hand, the Tathāgata: these are non-dual, they are not divided into two.41 Practicing in this way, a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva. Mañjuśrī, discipline, awakening, and sentient beings and, on the other hand, the Tathāgata: these are non-dual, they are not divided into two. Practicing in this way, a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva.
“It is the same way with forbearance, awakening, and sentient beings, and, on the other hand, the Tathāgata; diligence, awakening, and sentient beings, and, on the other hand, the Tathāgata; concentration, awakening, and sentient beings, and, on the other hand, the Tathāgata; and similarly, wisdom, awakening, and sentient beings, and, on the other hand, the Tathāgata. These are non-dual, they are not divided into two. Practicing in this way, a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva.

“Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva may practice thinking that ‘form is not empty’ and also ‘not non-empty.’ Practicing in this way, Mañjuśrī, that bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva. And why? He thinks, ‘Form itself is empty of the essence of form. In the same way, [F.299.a] feeling, notion, co-producing factors, and consciousness are empty.’ He practices thinking in this way and also thinking that ‘they are not non-empty.’ Practicing in this way, Mañjuśrī, a bodhisattva practices within the conduct of a bodhisattva. And why? Because mind, mentality, and consciousness are not perceived.

Just like those schools have their own classification systems. For instance, from a Huayan perspective Vajrayana would fall into the category of Final Mahayana, that is above Madhyamaka and Yogacara but below the Sudden Enlightenment teaching. And from the Chan view Tantra is still a gradual path based on temporary skilful means.

Malcolm wrote:
These historical interpretations of the Buddha's career have no relevance at all to Vajrayāna. The idea of dividing up the career of the Buddha into distinct epochs is a uniquely Chinese historiographical idea. The Indian Mahāyānis certainly didn't care about such interpretations and never made them, in fact they rejected them.

As to the Chan point of view, this is addressed by Nubchen Sangye Yeshe. Chan lacks the direct introduction found exclusively in Vajrayāna, this is why he ranks Chan below Mahāyoga.

As far as I am concerned, Chan sudden enlightenment is mere rhetoric and cannot be taken seriously. But I am sure if I were a Chan or a Zen practitioner, I would feel differently about it.

For example, when it is says that bodhisattvas can attain full buddhahood in seven lifetimes, this is not referring to bodhisattva on the path of accumulation, it is referring to bodhisattvas on the eighth bhumi, etc.

If those who have heard this profound prajñā-pāramitā are not shocked, not terrified, not baffled, and not regretful, but believe, accept, appreciate, and listen tirelessly, they have in effect achieved dāna-pāramitā, śīla-pāramitā, kṣānti-pāramitā, vīrya-pāramitā, dhyāna-pāramitā, and prajñā-pāramitā.

All the different types of sentient beings, whether they be born from eggs, born from a womb, born from moisture or born spontaneously; whether or not they have form; whether they abide in perceptions or no perceptions; or without either perceptions or non-perceptions, I save them by causing them to enter nirvana without remainder. And when these immeasurable, countless, infinite number of sentient beings have been liberated, in actuality, no sentient being has attained liberation. Why is this so?

The Tibetan and Sanskrit make it more clear, the above refers to a thought that bodhisattva has, not an actual fact of his or her saving anyone.
Subhuti, here, the one who has correctly entered into the bodhisattvayāna thinks in this way, "However many sentient beings there are, included in egg-birth, womb-birth, heat and moisture-birth and apparitional birth, with form, without form, with perception, without perception or without perception and non-perception, as many sentient beings as are designated sentient beings, all of them I will free through total nirvana in the state [dhātu] of nirvana without remaining aggregates. As such, though limitless sentient beings have been freed through total nirvana, no sentient beings will have been freed through parinivana." Thus that one should generate this thought.

Direct, non-conceptual experience of emptiness occurs in equipoise, but lower-level Bodhisattvas have (conceptual) mind and subject/object dualism in post-meditation.
A couple verses in translation, this time from Geshe Tenzin Zopa of Sera Je Monastery:

And another version of verse 2:

Relative and absolute,
These the two truths are declared to be.
The absolute is not within the reach of intellect,
For intellect is grounded in the relative.

TsongKhapaFan, you can see that even a Gelukpa Geshe's translation is more in line with the actual words.  You should compare this to your version.

Tsongkhapafan said:
This translation is very poor. There are no absolute things because there is nothing that does not depend and nothing that is not relative. Ultimate truth is not absolute.

Even though it is a bad translation, the meaning is in line with my understanding - a direct realisation of emptiness, that is, a non-conceptual realisation, is not possible with a conceptual mind (badly rendered as 'intellect' here). This is Shantideva's intention. It is absurd to assert that the mind cannot know emptiness because the mind is a conventional truth, which was Malcolm's original and incorrect assertion. It is only the mind that knows anything, and if the mind doesn't know it, how else is it possible to perceive and realise emptiness?

Your intepretation is clearly not what Shantideva is saying at all, but you're free to believe whatever you want.

Malcolm wrote:
One, you are not qualified to judge any translations, since you a) do not know Tibetan b) do not know Sanskrit.

David Reigle said:
I have now finished reading Bhavya’s Vedānta chapter and other chapters of his Madhyamaka-hṛdaya. I found it interesting that even in this chapter, like in his refutations of the ātman in previous chapters, the ātman he refutes is a kartṛ, “doer” or “agent,” and a bhoktṛ, “enjoyer” or “experiencer.” This confirms Kamaleswar Bhattacharya’s thesis that the ātman refuted in Buddhism was not the universal ātman. Bhavya, like Vasubandhu before him, and like Śāntarakṣita after him, understood the ātman that Buddhists refute to be a permanent personal ātman that can act and experience. It was not until a couple centuries after Bhavya that Śaṅkarācārya formulated the Advaita Vedānta view of the ātman, on the basis of passages found in the Upaniṣads, and promulgated it widely. This idea of a non-dual universal ātman that, as such, cannot be an agent or an experiencer, has dominated Indian thought ever since. But this was not the idea of the ātman that Buddhists refuted, as their texts show, and it is incorrect to project this idea backwards onto the ātman that they refuted.

Malcolm wrote:
All that you have stated is that the concept of a universal atman is specifically Śaṅkarācārya's point of view. It is also equally incorrect therefore to project this idea backward and infer that this universal atman is one that is implicitly affirmed by the Buddha.

Looking through the original Chinese article, there are a series of photos of the lama who is said to be the father of the child. There is a screenshot of an instagram page with the lama's picture and a caption describing the relationship. The lama pictured is clearly NOT Dzongsar Jamyang Khyentse Rinpoche. While the instagram account sh3rylk is no longer there, one of the screenshots names the lama as Zuri Rinpoche from Bhutan. Somehow, the authors of the more recent article in the OP must have thought there was only one Bhutanese tulku in existence, or did not bother to look up pictures of Khyentse Rinpoche.

Another problem with this kind of article is that it does not make explicit in Chinese that lamas like Ponlop Rinpoche and Khyentse Rinpoche are not ordained monks. In the eyes of the Chinese, they are monks, leading to a great number of misunderstandings, as evidenced by the comments section in the Chinese article.

Ordinary sentient beings are on the path of accumulation and preparation while noble beings are on the paths of seeing, cultivation and no more training.

In Mahāyāna the path requires at minimum three incalculable eons. In Vajrayāna, the path can be reduced to one, three, seven or at most sixteen lifetimes. The paths and stages however are the same.

They are not free of all traces of affliction and have no path to realize complete freedom from all traces of affliction because they do not possess sarvakārajñāna, knowledge of all aspects. And, according to AA, they "take a stand" in nirvana, believing it to be real.

Nirvana, incidentally, is not part of the aggregates, since it is unconditioned. It is part of the dharmadhātu, however.

Thus there is the contradiction in your thinking that I mentioned before. Arhats abandon ten fetters, but as the view of self is the one of the three lower fetters, it is abandoned only once, at stream entry, and at that time, it is abandoned totally.

Astus said:
Knowing that there is no self, that is, obtaining correct view, and abandoning all clinging to the aggregates are not the same. A stream-enterer is convinced of the four noble truths, an arhat has completely realised the four noble truths. See also: http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn48/sn48.053.than.html.

"In the same way, friends, it's not that I say 'I am form,' nor do I say 'I am other than form.' It's not that I say, 'I am feeling... perception... fabrications... consciousness,' nor do I say, 'I am something other than consciousness.' With regard to these five clinging-aggregates, 'I am' has not been overcome, although I don't assume that 'I am this.'

"Friends, even though a noble disciple has abandoned the five lower fetters, he still has with regard to the five clinging-aggregates a lingering residual 'I am' conceit, an 'I am' desire, an 'I am' obsession. But at a later time he keeps focusing on the phenomena of arising & passing away with regard to the five clinging-aggregates: 'Such is form, such its origin, such its disappearance. Such is feeling... Such is perception... Such are fabrications... Such is consciousness, such its origin, such its disappearance.' As he keeps focusing on the arising & passing away of these five clinging-aggregates, the lingering residual 'I am' conceit, 'I am' desire, 'I am' obsession is fully obliterated.
( http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn22/sn22.089.than.html )

"My friend, although I have seen properly with right discernment, as it actually is present, that 'The cessation of becoming is Unbinding,' still I am not an arahant whose fermentations are ended. It's as if there were a well along a road in a desert, with neither rope nor water bucket. A man would come along overcome by heat, oppressed by the heat, exhausted, dehydrated, & thirsty. He would look into the well and would have knowledge of 'water,' but he would not dwell touching it with his body. In the same way, although I have seen properly with right discernment, as it actually is present, that 'The cessation of becoming is Unbinding,' still I am not an arahant whose fermentations are ended."
( http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.068.than.html )

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, and the point is that, according to the Buddha in Mahāyāna sūtras, arhats have not abandoned "a lingering residuum", i.e. the traces I mentioned in a previous post. Also here it is clear that distinction between the noble disciple with these lingering residuums is precisely the difference between equipoise and post equipoise, as I also stated above, the idea being that arhats in this instance have nothing left to remove so that whether they are in equipoise or not is a matter of preference, not of liberation.

So the point is, to repeat my earlier citation, the Śatasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā states:
...because they have not attained knowledge of all aspects, there is the obscuration of not abandoning all afflictions connected with traces, the śravakas and prayekabuddhas endowed with [traces of] afflictions do not have a path by which those may be abandoned.
So the choice is really simple, you can either accept the Buddha's Mahāyāna teaching in this instance or you can ignore it. It is clear from Mahāyāna accounts that arhats and pratyekabuddas, along with bodhisattvas, have not abandoned all traces. And it is because of this that arhats and pratyekabuddhas are "woken" from their samadhis of cessation to continue on the bodhisattva path to attain full buddhahood.

As we begin eliminating the kilesas, we catch a glimpse of the mind’s true essence, what we call the citta.
Until, finally, when we realize the nature of the citta completely, the attachment to the world entirely disappears. There is no need to make an effort to give up things because at that stage giving up is automatic. This is the true aim of the Buddha’s teaching.

Some Thai forest masters in Theravada describe a stable reality completely outside the five khandas that doesn't have the three characteristics. They call it the citta. It isn't born, doesn't die, and when you get to nirvana it merges with nirvana and goes home. It is the unchanging reality, the unchanging knower. It occupies a neutral position between dualities like happiness and suffering. It simply knows them. No English equal of this word exists so it is difficult to translate from Pali into English and in fact the citta can't even be expressed properly in words or concepts so it doesn't really matter. It is usually translated as mind but this is incorrect because what we generally refer to as mind is just a bunch of transient things that arise and fall away. This isn't the citta. The citta exists entirely without reference to time and space. It does not arise or fall away. It is the creator, it creates the five aggregates of body and mind. It is the very foundation of samsara. It is the essence of being that wanders from birth to birth. The Citta is naturally pure but it's the mental defilements infiltrating the citta that cause it to experience happiness and suffering but the true nature of the citta has none of these qualities. I can go on and on but basically I'm just looking to find out if there's anything similar to this in Mahayana, Vajrayana, Tibetan Buddhism, maybe even Bon, etc. And any Theravada Buddhists that might be passing through that have no idea what I'm talking about you can read Ajahn Pannavaddho's book uncommon wisdom online for free, he has an entire section on the citta. Things like Merging with nirvana and going home are not things I made up.

Although the Great Prajnaparamita Sutra in the Chinese canon (Taisho 220) is not necessarily the same, but that is the only one to contain the term "two hindrances" (二障) among the prajnaparamita texts, and even there it is just one section repeated at three different places where the qualities of the bodhi of great bodhisattvas are described, and contains no explanation what the afflictive and cognitive hindrances (煩惱所知二障) mean. It is also noteworthy that it was translated by Xuanzang, who brought many Yogacara works to China.

Malcolm wrote:
The Āryāṣṭasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā-=sūtra states:
Bhagavān, the prajñāpāramitā, for the purpose of abandoning the obscurations of affliction, knowledge and all related traces, does not generate all phenomena.
The Śatasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā mentions afflictive obscurations: in response to the question of whether or not sravakas and pratyekabuddhas abandon the obscuration of traces of affliction it also answers in the negative :
...because they have not attained knowledge of all aspects, there is the obscuration of not abandoning all afflictions connected with traces, the śravakas and prayekabuddhas endowed with [traces of] afflictions do not have a path by which those may be abandoned
So, according to the Prajñāpāramitā, not only do śrāvaka arhats and pratyekabuddha arhats not realize the knowledge of all aspects, they do not have a path where they can abandon all traces of affliction.

The Prajñāpāramitā in general mentions three kinds of obscurations: karma, affliction and view. It also clarifies that though śrāvaka arhats and pratyekabuddha arhats do abandon afflictions, there are left over traces which do not adhere to the tathāgata:
Though all the śravakas and prayekabuddhas abandon afflictions, there are changes of the body, but the tathāgata does not possess such [changes], that is called "the tathāgata's total abandonment of the obscuration of traces."
So not only are three obscurations mentioned in the PP, but also the fact that arhats and pratyekabuddhas have traces of affliction for which they lack of path for abandoning.

The fact is that there are limits on the knowledge of arhats that are not imposed on the Buddha's knowledge. You may not think this is important, but these limits are what consitute the non-afflictive ignorance mentioned by Vasubandhu and Maitreyanatha.

This is just not a controversial point — everyone accepts that compared to a Buddha, the knowledge of a śrāvaka arhat has limitations. For example, Bhikkhu Bodhi has this to say:
Other arahants can certainly teach, and many do teach groups of disciples. Nevertheless, as teachers they do not compare with the Buddha. This is so in at least two respects: First, the Dhamma they teach others is one that comes from the Buddha, and thus ultimately the Buddha is the source of their wisdom; and second, their skills in teaching never match in all respects the skills of the Buddha, who is the only one who knows the path in its entirety.

Let's have a cite, and not a bald assertion, nor a Mahayana text. Let's have a Nikaya or an Agama or even some pre-Commentarial Abhidhamma or Abhidharma someplace - that is, a relatively early sravakayana text - that speaks about non-afflictive ignorance.

The Abhidharmakoṣabhāṣyaṭīkātattvārtha by Sthiramati cites an Agamic sūtra to the following effect:

In sūtra it is said, "Śāriputra, do you know the Tathāgata's aggregate of discipline, aggregate of samadhi, aggregate of liberation, or aggregate of wisdom of liberation?"
"No, Bhagavan" he replied."

Therefore, the knowledge of others apart from buddhas cannot engage the [18 unshared] dharmas of the buddha, and therefore, it is said "The śrāvakas and so on possess a non-afflictive ignorance about the dharmas of a buddha."
Then Yasomitra gives the example of Maudgalyāyana not knowing where his mother had taken rebirth, and so on.

These statements are completely non-controversial.

We always have to keep in mind that Buddhist authors often depart from Paninian standards when etymologizing terms.

The Abhisamayalamkara (or at least what is in Gone Beyond, haven't checked other works) follows the Yogacara interpretation, that with the complete transformation of the basis cognitive obscurations are completely removed and thus buddhahood is attained. Since the hindrance to knowledge is a set of attachments to concepts, basically various forms of subject-object duality, and that should no longer exist for an arhat who does not identify with any aggregate, there should be no difference.

What could make a difference - if it is accepted that an arhat has no clinging at all - is just the time spent with accumulating merit that generates the karmic force for the buddha attributes. But then there cannot be a tathagatagarbha.

Title: Re: Natural Luminosity

Malcolm wrote:
BTW, I just noticed that David Reigle, who posts here from time to time has an interesting article on just this very topic. He says:
The Sanskrit word prabhāsvara was translated into Tibetan as ’od gsal, meaning literally “clear (gsal) light (’od).” Thus, thanks to the many translations of Buddhist texts from Tibetan into English in recent decades, prabhāsvara has come to be known in English as “clear light” via its Tibetan translation ’od gsal. Translators working directly from the Sanskrit texts have usually preferred to translate prabhāsvara with words such as “luminosity” or “luminous,” for a couple of reasons. In standard Sanskrit, prabhāsvara was only known as an adjective, defined by Monier-Williams as “shining forth, shining brightly, brilliant,” and by V. S. Apte as “brilliant, bright, shining.” As we can see, the Tibetan translation ’od gsal, “clear light,” is a noun. It is hard to make “clear light” into an adjective if needed (although not impossible), while “luminosity” can easily be made into the adjective, “luminous.” Another reason would be that prabhāsvara is not a compound term in Sanskrit, like “clear (gsal) light (’od)” is in Tibetan. It consists of the main part, bhāsvara, which by itself means the same as prabhāsvara, plus the prefix pra. While prefixes such as pra obviously add something to the meaning of a word, what they add, more often than not, is not enough to require an additional word in the translation.

How, then, did prabhāsvara come to be translated into Tibetan as ’od gsal, “clear light”? One of the many meanings of the prefix pra when added to nouns, according to the Gaṇa-ratna-mahodadhi by Vardhamāna as cited by Vaman Shivaram Apte in The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary, is “purity,” giving the example, prasannaṃ jalam, which means “pure water” or “clear water.” This shows us why ’od gsal, “clear light,” was chosen long ago as the standardized Tibetan translation of prabhāsvara, rather than just ’od, “light.” Yet the related Sanskrit word prabhā was translated into Tibetan as just ’od, “light,” even though it has the prefix pra. In prabhā, as is more usual, the prefix pra does not change the meaning from “light” to “clear light.” An example of an actual compound term in Sanskrit is the title Vimala-prabhā, meaning “stainless (vimala) light (prabhā).” It seems, then, that the addition of gsal, “clear,” to ’od, “light,” serves to distinguish ’od gsal, “clear light,” as a technical term. So there is good reason to translate prabhāsvara either as “clear light” or as “luminosity.” A translator must choose one or the other, and the choice may come down to nothing more than indicating whether the translation was made from the Sanskrit directly or from a Tibetan translation.
http://prajnaquest.fr/blog/prabhasvara-in-the-canonical-texts-and-in-cosmogony/

David Reigle said:
First, thank you Malcolm, for finding and translating and posting all those passages on prabhāsvara. This type of research is very helpful. As you say, “Natural luminosity [rang bzhin gyis od gsal ba], as very clearly stated in the citations above, is a description of the purity of all phenomena.”

In the paragraphs quoted from me, I see that I did not give the full etymology of prabhāsvara. After noting that prabhāsvara is not a compound term, I only spoke of the prefix pra and the main part bhāsvara. For those who may be interested, the word bhāsvara is built from the root bhās, meaning “shine,” plus the suffix vara. This vara is not the word vara, but rather is the primary affix vara. There is a rule for it in the great Sanskrit grammar by Pāṇini, 3.2.175, saying that it is used with five roots including bhās. According to the translation by Śrīśa Chandra Vasu, it has the sense of “the agents having such a habit, etc.” According to the translation by Sumitra M. Katre, it is used “to denote the agent’s habitual disposition, duty or excellence” (the meaning is carried down from 3.2.134). Two more of these five words are common, and will help to show this meaning: sthāvara, “stationary, immovable,” from sthā, “stand, remain”; and īśvara, “ruler, lord,” from īś, “rule.”

For words like prabhāsvara, whose etymology is not obvious, here is a little trick that is helpful to people like me who are not Pāṇini specialists. The very old Sanskrit-English Dictionary by Horace Hayman Wilson (has been reprinted in India), unlike the later ones by Monier-Williams and V. S. Apte that are currently in use, gives traditional Pāṇinian etymologies. It gives them using Pāṇini’s technical terms, so that you may still need a dictionary of these technical terms in order to determine the etymology (A Dictionary of Sanskrit Grammar, K. V. Abhyankar and J. M. Shukla, or Dictionary of Pāṇini, S. M. Katre). Wilson does not list prabhāsvara, but he does list bhāsvara, the same word without the prefix pra. There he gives for the etymology: bhās, to shine, varac, affix. The final “c” on varac is a code letter used by Pāṇini. Looking up varac, the reference books then point you to Pāṇini’s sūtra 3.2.175.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_in_Buddhism

"Some variations of Buddhism express a philosophical belief in an eternal Buddha: a representation of omnipresent enlightenment and a symbol of the true nature of the universe. The primordial aspect that interconnects every part of the universe is the clear light of the eternal Buddha, where everything timelessly arises and dissolves"




"Mahayana Buddhism is not only intellectual, but it is also devotional... in Mahayana, Buddha was taken as God, as Supreme Reality itself that descended on the earth in human form for the good of mankind. The concept of Buddha (as equal to God in theistic systems) was never as a creator but as Divine Love that out of compassion (karuna) embodied itself in human form to uplift suffering humanity. He was worshipped with fervent devotion... He represents the Absolute (paramartha satya), devoid of all plurality (sarva-prapancanta-vinirmukta) and has no beginning, middle and end... Buddha... is eternal, immutable... As such He represents Dharmakaya."
—Professor C. D. Sebastian

"According to the Tathagatagarbha sutras, the Buddha taught the existence of this spiritual essence called the tathagatagarbha or Buddha-nature, which is present in all beings and phenomena. B. Alan Wallace writes of this doctrine:

"The essential nature of the whole of samsara and nirvana is the absolute space (dhatu) of the tathagatagarbha, but this space is not to be confused with a mere absence of matter. Rather, this absolute space is imbued with all the infinite knowledge, compassion, power, and enlightened activities of the Buddha. Moreover, this luminous space is that which causes the phenomenal world to appear, and it is none other than the nature of one's own mind, which by nature is clear light."
—B. Alan Wallace


""Samantabhadra, the primordial Buddha whose nature is identical with the tathagatagarbha within each sentient being, is the ultimate ground of samsara and nirvana; and the entire universe consists of nothing other than displays of this infinite, radiant, empty awareness. Thus, in light of the theoretical progression from the bhavanga to the tathagatagarbha to the primordial wisdom of the absolute space of reality, Buddhism is not so simply non-theistic as it may appear at first glance."
—B. Alan Wallace

"The Rinzai Zen Buddhist master, Soyen Shaku, speaking to Americans at the beginning of the 20th century, discusses how in essence the idea of God is not absent from Buddhism, when understood as ultimate, true Reality"

No need to torture the text... the meaning is clear.  The first three lines are obviously talking about the three meditative experiences of bliss, clarity, and non-conceptuality (བདེ་གསལ་མི་རྟོག་པའི་ཉམས་གསུམ་) and interestingly here the 3rd Karmapa uses luminosity ('od gsal) rather than clarity (gsal) for the second experience. He uses luminosity ('od gsal) and clarity (gsal) as interchangeable in this context.

There is one line here that is relevant: མཚན་འཛིན་མེད་པའི་འོད་གསལ་སྒྲིབ་གཡོགས་བྲལ། and མཚན་འཛིན་མེད་པ is clearly modifying luminosity (་འོད་གསལ) describing it as something that does not grasp at attributes. Of course, grasping /not grasping is a very common way of talking about "knowers." Your suggestion "Featureless luminosity” does not capture this and is incorrect.

Malcolm wrote:
These are experiences of a mind, not a cognizer itself, that should be obvious to you from the text.

There are no attributes to grasp in luminosity. On the other, hand, if it is as you say, this is still not the rang bzhin 'od gsal, since that is clearly ultimate, and not a fleeting experience, the attachment to which results in a form realm rebirth.

The fact that Tai Situ introduces the fact that it is the 'od gsal of rang rig proves that in this case. You elided rig in rang rig in your translation, in response I elided 'dzin pa. Perhaps what it should read is "the unobscured luminosity of a featureless apprehension." Read this way, it places luminosity as an adjective of rang rig, which is clearly how the Situ 8 sees it, rang rig 'od gsal, where 'od gsal is an adjective describing rang rig.

Thanks, Malcolm, very helpful. I am not trying to be difficult, and I accept the basic premise 100%. Just interested in exploring the philosophical ramifications.



Malcolm wrote:
Sure, you would need to examine the Abhisamayālaṃkara literature, it is treated most at length there.

BTW, I just noticed that David Reigle, who posts here from time to time has an interesting article on just this very topic. He says:

Wayfarer said:
The Sanskrit word prabhāsvara was translated into Tibetan as ’od gsal, meaning literally “clear (gsal) light (’od).” Thus, thanks to the many translations of Buddhist texts from Tibetan into English in recent decades, prabhāsvara has come to be known in English as “clear light” via its Tibetan translation ’od gsal. Translators working directly from the Sanskrit texts have usually preferred to translate prabhāsvara with words such as “luminosity” or “luminous,” for a couple of reasons. In standard Sanskrit, prabhāsvara was only known as an adjective, defined by Monier-Williams as “shining forth, shining brightly, brilliant,” and by V. S. Apte as “brilliant, bright, shining.” As we can see, the Tibetan translation ’od gsal, “clear light,” is a noun. It is hard to make “clear light” into an adjective if needed (although not impossible), while “luminosity” can easily be made into the adjective, “luminous.” Another reason would be that prabhāsvara is not a compound term in Sanskrit, like “clear (gsal) light (’od)” is in Tibetan. It consists of the main part, bhāsvara, which by itself means the same as prabhāsvara, plus the prefix pra. While prefixes such as pra obviously add something to the meaning of a word, what they add, more often than not, is not enough to require an additional word in the translation.

How, then, did prabhāsvara come to be translated into Tibetan as ’od gsal, “clear light”? One of the many meanings of the prefix pra when added to nouns, according to the Gaṇa-ratna-mahodadhi by Vardhamāna as cited by Vaman Shivaram Apte in The Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary, is “purity,” giving the example, prasannaṃ jalam, which means “pure water” or “clear water.” This shows us why ’od gsal, “clear light,” was chosen long ago as the standardized Tibetan translation of prabhāsvara, rather than just ’od, “light.” Yet the related Sanskrit word prabhā was translated into Tibetan as just ’od, “light,” even though it has the prefix pra. In prabhā, as is more usual, the prefix pra does not change the meaning from “light” to “clear light.” An example of an actual compound term in Sanskrit is the title Vimala-prabhā, meaning “stainless (vimala) light (prabhā).” It seems, then, that the addition of gsal, “clear,” to ’od, “light,” serves to distinguish ’od gsal, “clear light,” as a technical term. So there is good reason to translate prabhāsvara either as “clear light” or as “luminosity.” A translator must choose one or the other, and the choice may come down to nothing more than indicating whether the translation was made from the Sanskrit directly or from a Tibetan translation.

The 8th Situpa clarifies in this verse that luminosity ( 'od gsal ) here is self-luminous ( rang rig 'od gsal ) and is of the nature of clarity ( gsal ).

Malcolm wrote:
You mean it is the luminosity of reflexive knowing, which is free from obscuration. Thus, since in this case 'od gsal is being used as an adjective for the absence of obscuration of the reflexive knower that does not apprehend characteristics, it is perfectly fine if that reflexive knower also has the characteristic of clarity; the two are not mutually exclusive when it comes to a mind. But the former [ 'od gsal ] is not the latter [ gsal ba ], nor the latter the former. In fact, this verse is perfectly consistent with the points I have made above.

You could have just as easily translated the line, "Featureless luminosity is unobscured." The question then arises, the featureless luminosity of what? The answer, of a reflexive knower.

Also, frankly translating lhun gyis grub [anābhoga] as spontaneous should be deprecated [as in code].

I am trying to understand this philosophically. It seems clear to me that 'things are not actually luminous'. If they were actually luminous then you could measure their luminosity using a photometer. So it seems 'luminosity', whether of mind or things, is a metaphorical expression. I think 'luminosity' must be a metaphor for 'knowing' - mind is intrinsically knowing, and that 'knowing' is fundamental to its nature; but that 'knowing' is not an attribute of 'something', it is simply an intrinsic attribute of mind.

Malcolm wrote:
Light = purity in the pre-modern mind.

Natural luminosity [ rang bzhin gyis od gsal ba ], as very clearly stated in the citations above, is a description of the purity of all phenomena. I did not exclude citations that were somehow inconvenient to this definition. On the contrary, I sought for them and could not find them because they do not exist.

Thus, to say that matter is naturally luminous is merely to say that it is ultimately pure. I am not sure why people are intent in ignoring the fact that the term "natural luminosity" is uniformly applied to all phenomena, all phenomena are naturally luminous, not only the mind.

To be sure, the term 'od gsal by itself can and is often used merely to refer to lights shining from the Buddha's uṛṇa and so on, the quality of the light of a gem and so on. But in this context, we are not discussing the generic term "light", we are discussing a very specific term, [ rang bzhin gyis od gsal ba ], which is a technical term that has a very persistent usage across a broad swath of sūtras and tantras.

Clarity [ gsal ba ] is the power of the mind to makes things evident. It is defined as the characteristic [ lakṣana ] of the mind, for example, in both Sakya Lamdre and Kagyu Mahāmudra.

Luminosity [in this context] and clarity, 'od gsal ba and gsal ba, are therefore, really not the same thing at all.

I very carefully looked for examples in the translations of Indian texts where gsal ba could be taken as an abbreviation of 'od gsal ba and was unable to find any at all. I have spent many hours engaged in this project. I also compared usages in available Sanskrit texts as well. Perhaps someone more skilled in Tibetan, in looking up citations, in reading them and in translating them, will be successful where I have failed.

Further, as I showed already, luminosity and clarity are treated separately and distinctly in one of the main sources for understanding the so called union of clarity and emptiness, which I presented in the tantra above.

I did not present this post with an intention to have a lengthy debate about the issue. I selected a few representative quotes out of hundreds (to avoid stultifying repetition) in order to edify all of you. If you choose to be edified, that is fantastic. If you prefer to cling to your own ideas, that is just fine with me too.

At this point, having restated my point of view three or four times, I will leave it here unless someone has something of further value to add. Otherwise, I fear we are just going in circles.

Then we have to be very precise, don't we? For example, we have in the Ṥrī-jñānavajra-samuccaya-tantra this line:
Luminosity ['od gsal ba] is the ultimate truth.
But we also have this verse in the same text:
If the two truths are separate, 
the path of wisdom is pointless. 
If clarity and emptiness ['gsal stong] are separate,
there will be falling into the extremes of permanence and annihilation.
Now, in case you are tempted to think that emptiness is relative, the same text clearly states:
Relative truth
is the moon in the water;
ulimate truth
is the eighteen emptinesses.
Luminosity is clearly described here as ultimate. Clarity here is clearly described as relative, the apparent and evident aspect of the two truths, as we can further see:
From the relative clarity arises the woman, 
the bhaga, and the assembly of goddesses.
Or for example, in Indrabhuti's Śrī-cakrasaṃvaratantrarājaśambarasamuccaya-nāma-vṛitti, it is stated:
There is joy from the gradual blazing everywhere from the three channels; and in a moment of experience, samsara and nirvana arise as nondual clarity and emptiness.
In any case, clarity [ gsal ba ] is described as relative, samsara; while luminosity [' od gsal ] is everywhere described as ultimate and nirvana; so how can gsal ba = 'od gsal? Clarity is relative and conditioned, luminosity is ultimate and unconditioned

Actually, what is being said is that space is pure, as the Śatasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā states:
Due to the element of space being naturally luminous, it is pure and without afflictions.

Luminosity is natural because its nature is pure.
And:
Since so-called "luminosity" is free from the temporary taint of subject and object because there is no reification, it is explained as naturally pure. The concept that there is a subject and object is called "reification"; since there is no concept of the existence of subject and object, so-called "luminosity" means "the characteristic of natural purity."
And:
Since the obscurations of knowledge and affliction do not exist, the luminosity of discerning wisdom (prajñā) is explained as "the purity of discerning wisdom."
Bhavaviveka states in the Tarkajvala:

"Luminous clarity" is so called because of being free from the darkness of affliction and objects of knowledge.

Jayānanda states in the Madhyamakāvatāraṭīkā-nāma:
It says in sūtra that "Tathāgatagarbha" means "All sentient beings have tathāgatagarbha." That passage concerns tathāgatagarbha. "Natural luminosity" means that natural luminosity is immaculate. It's characteristic is what which is pure. "Pure from the start" meanings immaculate from the beginning like space. "Possessing the thirty two major marks means possessing the nature of emptiness.
And:
So called "luminosity" means the nature of emptiness is intrinsically pure.
Prajñamokṣa's Madhyamakopadeśa-nāma-vṛtti states:
Luminosity is natural purity.

From the entry in one of his glossaries for 'luminosity': Note also that in both Sanskrit and Tibetan Buddhist literature, this term is frequently abbreviated just to Skt. “vara” and Tib. “gsal ba” with no change of meaning. Unfortunately, this has been thought to be another word and it has then been translated with “clarity”, when in fact it is just this term in abbreviation.
You're saying he's just wrong about this?

Malcolm wrote:
Yes. For one thing, he is splitting the word at the wrong place, i.e. he splits it as prabhās/vara.

The split is actually prabhā ['od]/ svara [gsal ba], hence prabhāsvara.

Prabhā means "light". svara primarily means "sound"; but also is the antonym of āsvara, indistinct, hence svara also has a meaning of "distinct". For example, the voice of a bodhisattva is described as prabhāsvara. If you look in the Sanskrit dictionary, you discover that prabhāsvara usually means "clear, shrill," but not in this case. When prabhāsvara is to be translated as "clear" as in a voice, it is rendered as gsal dbyangs, and not as 'od gsal.

The other Sanskrit terms which gsal ba generally translates are uttānaḥ, to stretch or vyaktaḥ, "...caused to appear , manifested , apparent , visible , evident", and a number other terms as well which are not included in the Mahāvyutpatti.

Because Consciousness/Awareness is the knowing principle it is commonly called ‘the light’ in spiritual literature.  It is not the light that makes physical sight possible but it is that because of which physical light…and everything that exists…is known.  It is uncreated and eternal.  It pervades everything and is the innermost Self of every living being.  Therefore every being is enlightened…in the light…by default.   However, the proof of enlightenment lies neither in the intellectual affirmation of enlightenment nor in the claim of the experience of an enlightened state of consciousness, but in the hard and fast understanding that Awareness is one’s essential identity.

To understand natural luminosity, the first place to start is with the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras. Most people are familiar with the famous statement:
There is no mind in the mind, but the mind is naturally luminous.
The Śatasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā, beginning with matter, ending with omniscience and including everything in between, states:
Due to matter being naturally luminous, it is pure and non-afflicted…due to omniscience of all aspects being naturally luminous, it is pure and non-afflicted.
Ārya-suvikrāntavikrami-paripṛcchā-prajñāpāramitā-nirdeśa states:
It is thought, “This mind is naturally luminous.” As this was thought, it is thought, “The mind arises based on a perception.” Since that perception is totally understood, the mind does not arise and does not cease. Such a mind is luminous, non-afflicted, beautiful, totally pure. Since that mind dwells in nonarising, no phenomena at all arise or cease.
The Ārya-prajñāpāramitānayaśatapañcāśatikā states:
Since prajñāpāramitā is totally pure, all phenomena are naturally luminous.
The Buddhāvataṃsaka-nāma-mahāvaipulya-sūtra states:
Since the original nature [prakriti] of the mind is luminous and endowed with purity, it is extremely pure…
The original nature [prakriti] of the mind is correctly known as peaceful, luminous and equivalent with space…
The natural luminosity of the dharmadhātu is abides as totality pure in the same way…
The Āryānantamukhapariśodhananirdeśaparivarta-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
Whatever is totally pure, that is an immaculate entryway, the mind is naturally luminous and never possesses afflictions. 
The Ārya-bodhisattvapiṭaka-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
All these phenomena are naturally pure, 
naturally luminous, fundamentally pure from the start,
unfabricated and imperceptible.
And:
If it is asked what is luminosity, that which is natural is without affliction, like space, the nature of space. Follow space. That which is equivalent with the extent of space itself is extremely luminous by nature. Therefore, the immature are temporarily afflicted because they do not comprehend natural luminosity. Since sentient beings do not know natural luminosity, they must comprehend natural luminosity…Due to understanding the natural luminosity of the mind just as it is, the unsurpassed perfected awakening through the discerning wisdom possessed by an instant of the mind is called “full buddhahood.”
The Ārya-lalitavistara-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
I have obtained the ambrosia of Dharma,
profound, peaceful, immaculate, luminous and unconditioned. 
Even though I explain it, no one will understand, 
I think I will remain in the forest without speaking. 
Free from words, untrained by speech,
suchness, the nature of Dharma, is like space
free from the movements of mind and intellect, 
supreme, amazing, the sublime knowledge…
Always like space, 
nonconceptual, luminous,
the teaching without periphery or center
is expressed in this Dharmawheel. 
Free from existence and nonexistence,
beyond self and nonself, 
the teaching of natural nonarising
is expressed in this Dharmawheel…
The Ārya-sarvabuddhaviṣayāvatārajñānālokālaṃkāra-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
Mañjuśrī, because the mind is naturally luminous, the secondary afflictions are exhausted by temporary secondary afflictions, but the primary afflictions do not exist by nature. Whatever is naturally luminous is without primary afflictions…
Mañjuśrī, awakening naturally luminous through the natural luminosity of the mind. If it is asked what is luminosity, whatever is natural is without the primary afflictions, is equal with space, has the nature of space and is included in space, and is like space because of being extremely luminous by nature.
The Ārya-cintye-prabhāsa-nirdeśa-nāma-dharmaparyāya states:
The child asked, how shall I discern this? The mind is naturally luminous, within that afflictions are not produced and it does not become afflicted.”
The Bhagavān replied, “It is just as you have said. The mind is always luminous, the common people become afflicted by temporary afflictions."
The Ārya-laṅkāvatāra-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
Purified of the afflictions
abandoned by meditation and seeing, 
the mind is naturally luminous,
the pure tathāgatagarbha;
but the addictions of sentient beings
are boundless and endless.
Just as when the surface of gold is polished, one sees
the gold color, the brilliant shine and the pure surface,
in just that way
is the sentient being in the aggregates.
The supreme ones have always shown 
the inexhaustible wisdom of the Buddha to be peace,
without a person, without the aggregates.
The natural luminosity of the mind
endowed with the affliction of mind and so on
along with [the affliction of] self
possesses temporary afflictions
from the start,
naturally luminosity can be purified of the affliction of self,
just like a [stained] cloth. 
Just as the flaws of either cloth or gold
can be cleansed because they are [intrinsically] stainless, 
which neither remain nor are destroyed, 
and likewise have the nature of being flawless.
The Āryātajñāna-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
Since all phenomena are naturally luminous, 
one should fully cultivate the perception of nonperception.
The Ārya-Śūraṃgamasamādhi-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
All phenomena are naturally luminous,
those are not real entities. 
When something is a nonentity, 
that is the purity of phenomena.
The Ārya-pratyutpanna-buddhasaṃmukhāvasthitasamādhi-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
Also the mind is pure, naturally luminous,
unperturbed, all pervasive and unadulterated.
And:
Since all these phenomena are naturally luminous, they are equivalent with nirvana.
The Ārya-bodhisattvagocaropāyaviṣayavikurvitanirdeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
Due to not being asserted in other vehicles, the mind is pure. Due to the removal of the turbulence of the afflictions, the mind is not afflicted. Due to naturally luminosity, the mind is luminous.
The Ārya-tathāgatamahākaruṇānirdeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
Due to the natural luminosity of the mind, awakening is naturally luminous. If it is asked why it is called “naturally luminous,” whatever is natural is without the afflictions, equivalent with space, the nature of space, and equal in extent with space, and even with space. That nature is very luminous. Since immature common people do not comprehend natural luminosity, they are afflicted by the afflictions…
The element of afflictions are fully known as the characteristics of the temporary afflictions. The element of purification is fully known as the characteristic of natural luminosity…
The natural luminosity of the mind should be known in just that way. Due to that, the Dharma of the existence of result is shown in one moment of mind.


The Ārya-gaganagañjaparipṛcchā-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
Whoever skillfully realizes all phenomena as pure,
that is the natural luminosity of the mind…
Because the mind is naturally luminous, 
therefore it is never afflicted.
There are of course many sūtra citations which I have excluded, but they all present a consistent theme.

Moving onto the tantras, we really do not find much variation on this theme, apart from the fact that the tantras tend to present a more precise explanation of the stages of the experience of luminosity in meditation (which will not be disclosed here). To begin with, the Ārya-ḍākinī-vajrapañjara-mahātantrarāja-kalpa-nāma states:
The dharmadhātu is luminous,
someone who meditates on that
is a sentient being who becomes equal with a buddha…
The dharmadhātu is luminous,
the taste of excellent bliss, 
called “the unobscured vajra.”
The Śrī-mahāsaṃvarodaya-tantrarāja-nāma states:
Natural luminosity
is beyond the range of analysis,
it is not low, not high, peaceful
it cannot be invoked,
it is inexpressible, beyond enumeration,
the aspect of emptiness
abiding as the nature all entities, 
free from all qualities such as sound and so on, 
this is the sources of the bliss of buddhahood.
The Saṃpūṭi-nāma-mahātantra states:
Natural luminosity is free from all concepts,
free from being covered by the taints of desire and so on, 
with subject and object, the supreme being
has said that is supreme nirvana…
all phenomena are naturally luminous, 
because all phenomena do not arise from the start, 
it is termed non-origination by the mind.
The Mahāmāyā-tantra-nāma states:
All phenomena are naturally luminous, 
pure from the start and without perturbation…
All phenomena are naturally luminous, 
pure from the start, like space.
The Śrī-vajramālābhidhānamahāyogatantra-sarvatantrahṛdaya-rahasyavibhaṅga-iti states:
Natural luminosity is stainless, 
free from all aspects.
The Sandhivyākaraṇa-nāma-tantra states:
This phenomena is naturally luminous,
since it is pure from the start, it is equivalent with space,
there is no awakening, no realization,
it is the explanation of bodhicitta.
The Māyājāla-mahātantrarāja-nāma states:
All phenomena are naturally luminous, 
pure from the start, without perturbation,
without sentient beings, without life, 
without buddhas and without awakening.
The Sarvatathāgatatattvasaṃgraha-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
Also everything is naturally luminous,
pure from the start, like space,
neither a phenomena nor a nonphenomena, 
inconceivable and delightful…
All phenomena are naturally luminous,
intrinsically pure from the start.
The Vajraśikharamahāguhyayoga-tantra states:
Since everything is naturally luminous, 
its nature will be pure from the start, 
afflictions will not be perceptible, 
there will also be no liberation of nirvana…
All phenomena are nonarising, 
totally luminous, peaceful from the start.


The Sarvarahasyo-nāma-tantrarājā states:
To explain the meaning of “sentient beings:”
the mind is naturally luminous…
whatever is naturally luminous
is unsurpassed bodhicitta.
The Śrī-paramādya-nāma-mahāyānakalparājā states:
Since prajñānapāramita is totally pure, all phenomena are naturally luminous.
The Ārya-guhyamaṇitilaka-nāma-sūtra states:
All conditioned things are impermanent, and never arose from the beginning in natural luminosity.
The Ārya-vajrapāṇyabhiṣeka-mahātantra states:
The wisdom free from concepts
is the actual buddhahood of all the past victors, 
that freedom from concepts
is demonstrated as the accomplishment of Secret Mantra. 
The result of that is pure,
naturally luminosity.
Whoever dwells in conceptuality
will never produce siddhis.
The Śrī-jñānavajrasamuccaya states:
Whatever arises from luminosity, 
that is called “mind,” “intellect" and “consciousness,”
that is the foundation of all phenomena,
the two stages are realized from
affliction and purification…
In order to explain the reality of all phenomena [gnas lugs], whatever arises from luminosity is dharmatā, the dhātu of naturally pure luminosity. Since a nonconceptual knowing awareness arises at the same time as the subtle vāyu, the mind [citta, sems] is the basis of all…
The reality of that inner consciousness,
nonconceptual innate dharmatā,
is the nature of luminosity, empty and not a self…
The reality of luminosity
is an unfabricated mind which arises from it
different from generic consciousness…
luminosity is the ultimate truth…
based on luminosity, the ultimate true state,
the path is traversed rapidly…
luminosity is dharmatā, suchness,
pure like space, great bliss,
unceasing, immaculate, peace,
ultimate, mahāmudra itself.
Mahāmudra of union
is attained from luminosity that is very free from proliferation…
Natural luminosity is totally pure, 
immaculate, like the element of space…
So, in the end we can see here that luminosity is uniformly considered to be a metaphor for the purity of both mind and phenomena. It is the critical point of meditation in Mahāyāna Buddhism, in both sūtra and tantra, and its experiential recognition leads in both cases to the realization of the final result, buddhahood. I have not included any citations from either sūtra and tantra which indicate how it is experientially entered, as that is beyond the scope of this post.

Finally, we can also see here in these citations that the naturally luminosity of the mind what is being termed tathāgatagarbha, dharmadhātu, and so on, and we can see that it is also termed emptiness, suchness, dharmatā and so on.

In any event, in the huge plethora of citations I found, there are three main adjectives for 'od gsal [prabhasvara]: purity, stainless and nonafflicted. The main metaphor for 'od gsal is space; it is identified with emptiness; and it is defined as non-arising.

oh my bad, I thought he just misspelled Srimala. of course the next question that begs is why he would think a Dzogchen master's writings would be considered to be an authority on anything to me.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, there is this, from your favorite sūtra:
The tathāgatagarbha is the tathāgatas' wisdom of emptiness. The tathāgatagarbha has not been previously seen by śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas nor realized.
This brings up what is this wisdom of emptiness? You have mentioned this emptiness before, but it is not exactly the extrinsic emptiness you imagine. Your presentation of these two emptiness suggests that not only the buddhadharmas but indeed the wisdoms too are innate to tathāgatagarbha, but a close reading of the Tibetan translation of this text does not support this idea:
Bhavagan, this wisdom of the emptiness of the tathāgatagarbha is of two kinds. If it is asked which two?, since the tathāgatagarbha abides as separate from the sheath of all afflictions, it is empty of the wisdoms because it has not been freed. Bhagavan, since the tathāgatagarbha does not exist separate from the buddhadharmas, by freeing it inconceivable wisdoms beyond the sands of the Ganges are attained.

Son of Buddha said:
Dude non of these passages are saying that the Buddha Nature is not the Dharmakaya, it has already been proven to you that the Dharmakaya is the Buddha nature in the Queen Srimala Sutra

Chapter 8: The Dharmakaya V96.   O’ Bhagavan, the extinction of suffering is not the destruction of the Dharma. Why so? Because the ‘extinction of suffering’ is known as the Dharmakaya of the World Honored One, which is beginningless, uncreated, unborn, undying, free from destruction, permanent unchanging, eternal, inherently pure, and separate from all the stores of defilement. The Dharmakaya is also not different from the inconceivable Buddha Natures which are more numerous than the sands of the river Ganges. The Dharmakaya of the World Honored One is called the Buddha Nature when it is obscured by the stores of defilement.”

Malcolm wrote:
The dharmakāya is what? It is the absence of intrinsic nature, as the Ārya-trikāya-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states quite succinctly:
Son of a good family, meaning of the dharmakāya of the tathāgatas is the absence of intrinsic nature, like space.
So yes, I agree with Maladevi when she tells the Buddha that dharmakāya is beginningless and so on, because the absence of an intrinsic nature, like space, is unconditioned.

Son of Buddha said:
likewise the quote up above also states the Dharmakaya(Full Buddhahood) is UNBORN and UNCREATED, which further proves the inherent enlightenment position.

Malcolm wrote:
No, it merely describes the dharmakāya, which the Buddha defines above as an absence of an intrinsic nature. Further, the Ārya-pratītyasamutpāda-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states very clearly:
Avalokiteśvara, it is as follows: this dependent origination is the dharmakāya of the Tathāgata; whoever sees dependent origination, they see the Tathāgata.
Or the Ārya-dharmasaṃgīti-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra which describes dharmakaya very clearly:
Whoever seeks the dharmatā of phenomena, seeks emptiness. Whoever seeks emptiness, cannot be debated by anyone. Whoever cannot be debated by anyone, abides in the Dharma of a śramaṇa. However abides in the Dharma of a śramaṇa, they do not abide anywhere; whoever does not abide anywhere, they are uncontaminated with regard to objects. Whoever is uncontaminated with regard to objects, they are without faults. Whoever is without faults, they are the dharmakāya; whoever is the dharmakāya, they are a Tathāgata; whoever is the Tathāgata, they is said to be nondual; whoever is nondual, they do not abandon samsara and do they accomplish nirvana; in other words, they are shown to be totally free of all concepts. Bhagavan, this is the Dharmasaṃgīti.
So here again, we see that emptiness, the absence of a intrinsic nature, is defined by the Buddha as dharmakāya. It also states:
Emptiness is the dharma. The dharmakāya is the parnirvana of the Tathāgata.
As to the idea that there is no cause for the dharmakāya, this assertion cannot be made without qualifications. The Saddharma-rāja-mahāyāna-sūtra states:
Buddhanature is a permanent cause; dharmakāya is a permanent result. If is asked how, the causal mind is the buddhanature, the result is attained through the yield of Dharma.

Son of Buddha said:
To add to my post above, Jñānavajra writes in the Ārya-laṅkāvatāra-nāma-mahāyānasūtra-vṛtti-tathāgata-hṛdayālaṃkāra-nāma:
The tathāgatagarbha is the dharmatā of the mind free from proliferation and luminous; that [dharmatā of the mind] is the stage of buddhahood.
isn't this quote just further proving what i am saying to you?

Malcolm wrote:
The dharmatā of the mind is the absence of an intrinsic nature.



Son of Buddha said:
Then of course one has to deal with the fact that ālayavijñāna is frequently termed "tathāgatagarbha." Here, one cannot use the excuse that the Lanka is provisional, since it is clear included in the third turning sūtras by those who choose to interpret sūtras in this way.
and you know the Lanka says the Alayavijnana is pure like an amala fruit in the hand with no imperfection right?

Malcolm wrote:
The Ārya-trikāya-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra also tells us that that purified ālayavijñāna is the dharmakāya:
The purified ālayavijn̄āna is the mirror-like wisdom, i.e. the dharmakāya; the purified afflicted mind [kliṣṭamanas] is the wisdom of uniformity; the purified mental consciousness is the individually discriminating wisdom, i.e. the sambhogakāya...etc.]
And yet the ālayavijñāna is also conditioned and momentary; so since you have admitted the equation tathāgatagarbha = the ālayavijñāna, you have admitted the tathāgatagarbha is conditioned. It is simple logic.
The alāyavijñāna is conditioned,
the tathāgatagarbha is the ālayavijñāna
therefore, the tathāgatagarbha is conditioned.
The mind is also pure, inherently, it is also conditioned inherently; purity and being conditioned are not mutually exclusive.

Now, if someone is going to assert the tathātagarbha is a self, they will also have to assert that the mind (citta) is a self. Then they will find themselves on a very slippery slope. But if, on the other hand, they assert merely that innate purity of the mind is all that is intended by tathāgatagarbha, then of course they will remain on level ground with no danger of falling in the ravine of permanence and annihilation. And perhaps it is needless to say, but this luminosity is only universal in the sense that it is a characteristic of everyone's mind, like heat in fire or wetness in water.

Son of Buddha said:
I don't know who would be crazy enough to assert that the Tathagatagarbha is a Atman(Self)

Is there Self in the 25 existences or not?” The Buddha said: “O good man! “Self” means “Tathagatagarbha” [Buddha-Womb, Buddha-Embryo, Buddha-Nature]. Every being has Buddha-Nature. This is the Self.

As I have cited before Śrī Siṃha is very clear about this idea of 'primordial buddhahood' or 'inherent enlightenment' being a misunderstanding, and you should make sure you are VERY clear on this, otherwise you will compromise your chances of buddhahood altogether:

This is acceptable since a so called “primordial buddhahood” is not asserted. Full awakening is not possible without being free of the five afflictions... It is not possible for wisdom to increase without giving up afflictions. Wisdom will not arise without purifying afflictions.
I have 5 translations of the Queen Srimala Sutra which is literally my favorite sutra and I have NEVER seen this passage ever, do you care to send a link to the chapter and translation you are using (the sutra itself is only 36 pages long so you should have no problem whatsoever sourcing this)

Nevertheless the role of the Tathāgatagarbha is at least analogous to the idea of Ātman, insofar as insight into the Tathāgatagarbha is liberating (in a way similar to the insight into Ātman is said to be.)

But you can acknowledge that, without saying they're the same.

Malcolm wrote:
One, the Indian scholastics belonging to the Madhyamaka and Yogacara strains did not really pay much attention to this idea or this class of sūtras. There exists but a single commentary and subcommentary on the tathāgarbhasūtras, the Ratnagotravibhaga, aka, the Uttaratantra (a title in all probability derived from the Nirvana Sūtra, which describes itself as such).

Most of the Tibetan scholastics around the issue arise from the Tibetan desire to reconcile the five treatises of Maitreyanatha with Madhyamaka.

In so far as tathagatagarbha being analogous to the notion of atman, it is simply another example of Buddhist expropriation and redefinition, so that now "ātman", in these sūtras, represents the potential to become a Tathāgata, which all sentient beings possess, the seed of buddhahood, as the Nirvana Sūtra so clearly states.

In any case, the idea is far more important outside of India than it was in India. We should take that into consideration. It was also far more important to later Indian Buddhists (Vajrayāna) than to earlier ones (common Mahāyāna), and that also needs to be taken into consideration. We can understand this is a fact due to the increasing attention it receives in Vajrayāna commentaries. Whereas earlier Indian Buddhists wrote voluminous commentaries on the Prajñāpāramita with the Abhisamaya-ālaṃkara literature, on Yogacara with literature on the Mahāyāna Sutra-ālaṃkara and so on, they virtually neglect the Uttaratantra. However, there is another important text which can give us some alternate insight into this doctrine as it was understood in India, and that is the Āryalaṅkāvatāra-vṛtti by Jñānaśrībhadra. I cannot reproduce all 47+ comments he makes on tathagatagarbha in this text, but this one should give you an indication of what Indians in general understood tathagatagarbha to mean. They generally understood tathāgatagarbha as a synonym for the mind's natural luminosity:
Therefore, that dharmatā of the mind that is being examined [with regard to being] conditioned and unconditioned has always existed; because all sentient beings are possessors of tathāgatagarbha, these vessels of natural luminosity (prakṛtiprabhāsvara) are neither pure nor impure. Because they have spoiled that natural total purity, by abandoning the temporary flaws that the form of two arisisings, they are like gold, i.e., for that reason through category of permanence the tathāgatas are like precious gold.
Indeed the Ārya-laṅkāvatāra-mahāyāna-sūtra treats this metaphor in the following way:
Just as one sees the golden color, 
the natural shine and pure surface
when gold is polished, likewise
are sentient beings in the aggregates.
So here, of we want to apply the term nature (atman) to sentient beings, we can say that the nature (atman) of sentient beings is luminosity. But luminosity is just a metaphor for purity. For example, we see in the Ārya-bodhisattvapiṭaka-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:
All phenomena are naturally pure,
natural luminosity has always been the pure foundation, 
unfabricated and unperceived.
And also:
The kāya of the Tathāgata is natually pure, totally pure, free from the taints of all afflictions.
To illustrate this further, the Ārya-sarvabuddhaviṣayāvatārajñānālokālaṃkāra-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states very clearly:
Mañjuśrī, awakening (bodhi) is natural luminosity because of the natural luminosity of the mind itself. If it is asked for what reason is it luminous?, that which natural is totally without afflictions, equal with space, possessing the nature of space, truly inclusive of space and like space, because it is extremely luminous by nature.
And of course the Ārya-laṅkāvatāra-mahāyāna-sūtra clearly makes the equation between the naturally luminosity of the mind and the tathāgatagarbha:
Having purified the the afflictions
abandoned by cultivation and seeing,
the mind is natural luminous, 
the pure tathāgatagarbha.
It is also says:
The mind free of turbidty
is the opposite of the mental consciousness;
in order to understand all Dharmas, 
I have explained "The mind is the Buddha."
Now, if someone is going to assert the tathātagarbha is a self, they will also have to assert that the mind (citta) is a self. Then they will find themselves on a very slippery slope. But if, on the other hand, they assert merely that innate purity of the mind is all that is intended by tathāgatagarbha, then of course they will remain on level ground with no danger of falling in the ravine of permanence and annihilation. And perhaps it is needless to say, but this luminosity is only universal in the sense that it is a characteristic of everyone's mind, like heat in fire or wetness in water.

You'd either have to argue that schools following Awakening of Faith in Mahayana (most of East Asian Buddhism) are not Buddhist schools, or argue that although the text talks about inherent awakening, they really mean 'innately unconditioned' (that's a plausible argument).   But the Awakening of Faith, and many other East Asian Buddhist texts do use a term that translates as 'inherent awakening'.

We need to always keep in mind the use of "self" for ātman is a calque. Why is this? First of all self is a pronoun, ātman is a noun. ātman is almost impossible to render into English, adequately. We should also keep in mind that ātman is probably one of the most important words in Indian philosophy; way before Buddhism arrived on the scene.

We are not to see ātman as a mere self, the pronoun, but as the essence underlying everything—the permanent behind the impermanent.

Of course nirvana is a cessation, it is the cessation of the afflictions. Cessation is not an absence of being. An absence of being requires a being that is absent.

as you can see by these quotes posted below about the Self from the Nirvana Sutra

(1) the Buddha Nature is the Self, so if as you say the only self in the nirvana sutra is a conventional self(personality ego) then that means your idea of Buddha nature is that it is a conventional ego.

Malcolm wrote:
The term "self" is a merely convention no matter how you may think it is being used. So is permanent, true, unchanging, etc. These are all merely conventions and do not indicate anything real.


Son of Buddha said:
The very description of the True Self in the Nirvana Sutra is that it is Real.......... so the term Self in not merely convention no matter how you may think it is being used and the term Self is not a convention and its literal description in the Nirvana Sutra does in fact indicate it is real.
Nirvana Sutra: The Self is true [satya], real [tattva], eternal [nitya], sovereign/ autonomous/ self-governing [aisvarya], and whose ground/ foundation is unchanging [asraya-aviparinama], is termed ‘the Self’ [atman]. This is as in the case of the great Doctor who well understands the milk medicine. The same is the case with the Tathagata. For the sake of beings, he says “there is the Self in all things” O you the four classes! Learn Dharma thus!”

Malcolm wrote:
This passage merely indicates that sometimes Buddha taught there is no self, other times he taught there was a self, as an antidote to different extremes. It is not the case however that this passage is claiming there is an actual self that is real, permanent, and so on. The Nirvana sutra states, as mentioned before:
When it is explained that the tathāgatgarbha is empty, the immature cultivate an incorrect fear; the intelligent know permanence, stability and immutability to be illusory.
Also the idea that tathāgatagarbha is full-fledged buddhahood is contradicted by this passage:
The seed existing in oneself that turns into buddhahood is called "tathāgatgarbha," the buddhahood which one will obtain.
Or:
When the Tathāgata explains to the bhikṣus and bhikṣunis that his body is afflicted with a limitless great illness, at that time it should be understood that absence of self is being explained, and one should cultivate the meditation of selflessness. When the Tathāgata explains liberation is signless, empty and nothing at all, at that time one should understand the explanation that liberation is free from the 25 existences, and therefore it is called emptiness. Why?, since there is no suffering, there isn't any suffering at all, it is supreme bliss and signless. Why?, since that [suffering] is not permanent, not stable and not immutable, and because the nature of peace is not nonexistent, therefore, liberation is permanent, stable, immutable and peaceful, that is the Tathāgata. When the Tathāgata explains that the tathāgatagarbha exists sentient beings, at that time, one must correctly cultivate the meditation of permanence.
So really, it is not necessary reify liberation as a self, though some people may find it temporarily useful. But in the above statement there is no reason to reify an entity. Being free from the 25 or three realms does not mean that there is some entity outside of or apart from the three realms. A self either a) exists in the three realms, b) or it does not exist at all, or c) is just a philosophical abstraction used to describe the permanence of liberation when it is attained, and the permanent potential one has to be liberated.

As problems I notice, problems arise when the Indian Dharmakshema's Chinese translation of the long sūtra from Sanskrit [?] (translated into Tibetan by one Chinese monk, Wang-phab-zhwun; and two Tibetans, Dge-ba'i-blo-gros and Rgya-mtsho'i-sde) in fourteen chapters is compared against the Tibetan translation from Sanskrit text in five chapters and 3900 ślokas made by two Indian masters, Jinamitra and Jñānagarbha and one Tibetan translator, Devacandra.

Generally speaking, the Faxian's translation and Tibetan translation made by Jinamitra and Jñānagarbha and Devacandra are the same basic text. Dharmakshema's translation appears to be supplemented with extra texts. Hodges' account is really very interesting. In his view, everything not included in the Indian recension which is reflected by the Faxian translation and the Tibetan translation by Jinamitra and Jñānagarbha and Devacandra is entirely spurious and was composed by Dharmakshema himself, in other words, everything subsequent to chapter five (In the Yamamoto translation, chapters 1-17 corresponds with the five chapters found in the "short version).

Regarding Vinītadeva’s gloss of ātman in Vasubandhu’s commentary on his Vijñapti-mātratā-siddhi Viṃśatikā, verse 10, as rang gi ngo bo, or svarūpa, an intrinsic nature: Certainly svarūpa, like svabhāva that is found in this passage by Vasubandhu, is a synonym of ātman, when speaking of anātman or nairātyma. When pudgala-nairātmya, or absence of self in persons, was extended by Mahāyāna to dharma-nairātmya, or absence of self in dharmas, svabhāva was widely used as a synonym for nairātmya, and was often glossed by another synonym, svarūpa. It is exactly the point of Mahāyāna in using nairātyma for dharmas as well as for pudgalas or persons that it is the same absence of self.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, it is synonym for atman in the sense that atman is used to describe a nature, rather than an personal identity. The atman of persons and things is anātman. In the Nirvana sūtra, after describing atman in terms like tattva, nitya, etc., he also describes it as the natural great emptiness [ rang zhing gyis stong pa chen po ] Form this passage we can see his intent:
One must know that the teaching of the Buddha is "this is the middle way." The Bhagavān Buddha teaches the path as the middle way that is free from the extremes of permanence and annihilation. Some fools however, confused about the Buddha's teaching, like those with weak digestive heat who consume butter, quickly come to have views about the two extremes. Though existence is not established, also nonexistence is not established.
When the Buddha, in the Nirvana Sutra, discusses atman in personal terms, he very clearly states he only intends that there is a conventional self; when however he speaks of the self of phenomena, it is very clear by this that he intends emptiness as the "self" of phenomena.

Considering that parātman and brahman are universally equated in Advaita and Vedanta in general, we must here understand that Bhavaviveka is making fun of the Trimurti, since he contrasts their non-realization of nirvana with the realization of Avalokiteśvara, Maitreya, Samantabhadra and so on in the subsequent part of the passage.

bodhicittaṃ mahāmaitrīkaruṇājñānabhūṣaṇam |
There is no mention of either dharmatā or brahman in this passage. Thus you are following Lindtner in a huge leap which is totally unjustified when we examine the commentary:
Following that, with an unbiased mind, I shall endeavor to know the truth [tattvajñāna] which does not contradict reason and scripture through an examination of all textual systems...
This is hardly a proclamation that he [Bhavya] regards brahman to be an equivalent of dharmatā. Honestly, sometimes I think you people are like children in the woods eating berries without knowing whether they are poisonous or not, merely because they look pretty.

Bhattacharya’s thesis cannot be meaningfully evaluated by regarding it as eternalism. He is not saying that the Buddha was a closet eternalist. If he was, then the argument would be over before it started, with no need to ascertain his position. But he is not saying this. His thesis is more subtle than that.

Malcolm wrote:
What he is saying is that since the Buddha does not actively refute a concept found in the Upanishads, he upheld it. But this is unreasonable. One, the Buddha rejects the idea of an "all" outside of the fields of the six senses gates. Two, the Buddha clearly rejects a person apart from aggregates. Three, later Mahāyanis like Bhavaviveka explicitly reject such equations as Brahman = dharmakāya and so on. Four, the Buddha is clearly aware of Saṃkhya and rejected it., etc., etc.

Claiming "subtlety" as an argument won't work merely because one cannot present a rational for Bhattacararya's arguments beyond the fact that he made them.

Pluse we have the evidence of 25 centuries of awakened Buddhist masters, not one of whom ever proclaimed that there was no essential difference in meaning between Vedanta and Buddhadharma, quite the opposite.

I think David is right to point out that this is a glaring omission. However, it is not necessarily clear (at least to me) that these doctrines were fully developed in the Buddha's day.  And when the doctrines were fully developed, the Buddhists were quick to refute them.


Malcolm wrote:
It is not a glaring omission at all.

In any case, [apart from Chinese Buddhism, in which the doctrine of self has tragically reasserted itself like weeds in a garden left untended] there is a solid textual and instruction lineage tradition dating from the time of Ashoka to the present day which asserts that the teaching of the Buddha is in essence nairatmya, The trend of Buddhism called Pudgalavada was popular indeed, but it was never a transcendent self they asserted, merely an "inexpressible" self that was neither the same as nor different than the aggregates (which Vasubandhu polishes off very nicely in the refutation of the pudgala).

People who think they can ferret out the Buddha's meaning through textual analysis are very sad. Buddhadharma is, and always has been from the beginning an oral exegesis tradition, without which one cannot understand its doctrines.

Then of course, the Buddha refutes Samkhya, Vaiśeṣikaḥ Paśupatis, and so in the Lanka. One can hardly account for such refutations if one upholds the Buddha maintained a purusha like the Samkhyas, etc.

Well, you had the Samkhya running around --- although I don't know if they were fully formed in the Buddha's day, but they may have been. But the Upanishad's posit a self apart from the body and mind, and did the Samkhya philosophers. All the skandhas of the Buddha would fall roughly under the banner of prakirti, which was put forth as separate from purusha. I imagine a Samkhya would agree with the Buddha that none of the skandhas are the self, but that the self was independent of the skandhas.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, correct. The the pre-Buddhist Upanishads do posit such as self. And the Buddha studied Samkhya with Ārāḍa Kālāma, at least according to the Buddhacarita (circa 100 BCE).

I already pointed out that the Yoga Sūtras criticize yogins who become absorbed in Prakriti, and that this was really a critique of Buddhists.

In the Tibetan translation of the Uttaratantra commentary by Asanga, paramātman is translated as dam pa'i bdag, but it only occurs there.

David Reigle said:
Thanks, Malcolm, for this helpful information. For those who may want to see what is said there: The first of the two references to paramātman in the Ratna-gotra-vibhāga is in the commentary following verse 1.36, discussing the four qualities or perfections of śubha, ātman, sukha, and nitya, or purity, self, happiness, and permanence, given in 1.35. Shortly after the quote about these from the Śrīmālā-sūtra, the commentary says:

pañcasūpādāna-skandheṣv ātma-darśinām anya-tīrthyānām asad-ātma-grahābhirati-viparyayeṇa prajñā-pāramitā-bhāvanāyāḥ paramātma-pāramitādhigamaḥ phalaṃ draṣṭavyam

As translated by Karl Brunnhölzl, p. 363:

“By way of being the opposite of the tīrthakas, who are other [than us] and regard the five appropriating skandhas as a self, taking delight in clinging to a nonexistent self, the attainment of the pāramitā of the supreme self should be regarded as the fruition of [bodhisattvas’] having cultivated prajñāpāramitā.”

The second of the two references to paramātman in the Ratna-gotra-vibhāga is in verse 1.37:

sa hi prakṛti-śuddhatvād vāsanāpagamāc chuciḥ
paramātmātma-nairātmya-prapañca-vyupaśāntitaḥ || 1.37 ||

As translated by Karl Brunnhölzl:

“Because the [dharmakāya] is naturally pure
And free from latent tendencies, it is pure.
It is the supreme self because the reference points
Of self and no-self are at peace.”

Karl’s “reference points” translates prapañca, which has also been translated as “elaboration,” diversification,” “proliferation” (of concepts).

Malcolm wrote:
Well, this is how the whole passage reads:
From cultivating prajñāpāramita in order to turn away from seeing the five addictive aggregates as self, the non-existent self in which the others, the nonbuddhists, delight, one attains the result, the perfection of self. In this way all the others, the nonbuddhists, accept natureless things such as matter and so on as a self due to their being deceived by a characteristic of a self according to how those things are being apprehended, but that self never existed. 

The Tathāgata, on the other hand, has attained the supreme perfection of the selflessness of all phenomena through the wisdom that is in accord with just how things truly are, and though there is no self according to how he sees things, he asserts a self all the time because he is never deceived by the characteristic of a self that does not exist. Making the selfless into a self is like saying "abiding through the mode of nonabiding.

conebeckham said:
If you say that Tathagatagarbha does not exist primordially, somehow, in the continuua of sentient beings, you are saying Buddhahood is caused, and therefore "conditioned."

Malcolm wrote:
The Uttaratantra states:
Unconditioned, effortless, 
not realized through other conditions,
endowed with wisdom, compassion and power, 
buddhahood is endowed with two benefits.
But what does this really all mean?

When we examine Asanga's comments on this, he states:
When these are summarized, buddhahood is described with eight qualties. If it is asked what those eight qualities are, they are unconditioned, effortless, not realized through other conditions, wisdom, compassion, power, the abundance of one's own benefit and the abundance of others' benefit. [Buddhahood] is unconditioned because it is the nature of lacking a beginning, middle and end. It is called "effortless" because peace is endowed with the dharmakāya. It is not realized through other conditions because each person must realize it for themselves. It is wisdom because those three things are realized. [Buddhahood] is compassionate because [the Buddha] shows the path. It is powerful because it is free from suffering and affliction. The former three [unconditioned, effortless and not realized through other conditions] are for one's own benefit; the latter three [wisdom, compassion and power] are for others' benefit. 

In that regard, the conditioned is fully understood as arising somewhere, and also understood as abiding and perishing. Because those do not exist [arising, abiding and perishing], buddhahood itself is unconditioned without a beginning, middle and an end. This is seen as a differentiation made through the dharmakāya. Because all proliferation and concepts are pacified, [buddhahood] is effortless [lhun gyis grub].  Buddhahood is not realized through other conditions because it is realized through wisdom oneself produced. Here, udayo [to produce] is not the arising of a desire for realization. As such, the tathāgata is unconditioned due to the truth, out of the characteristics of non-engagement, all the activities of the buddha effortlessly engaged in without impediment and without interruption for as long as samsara exists
So let us parse this out a little bit.

Asanga states in his commentary on the Uttaratantra:
...the conditioned is understood as arising somewhere, and also understood as abiding and perishing. Because those do not exist [arising, abiding and perishing], buddhahood itself is unconditioned without a beginning, middle and an end.
Buddhahood is unconditioned because the trio of arising, abiding and perishing are false. Not because in contrast to things that arise, abide and perish, buddhahood does not arise, abide and perish.

Buddhahood however has a cause, as he writes:
Buddhahood is not realized through other conditions because it is realized through wisdom oneself produced.
Buddhahood is also effortless, because, as he writes:
...all proliferation and concepts are pacified, [buddhahood] is effortless [lhun gyis grub]...As such, the tathāgata is unconditioned due to the truth; and from the characteristics of non-engagement, all the activities of the buddha are engaged in effortlessly [lhun grub], without impediment and without interruption for as long as samsara exists
As for tathāgatagarbha always existing in the continuums of sentient beings; if you think somehow tathāgatagarba is something other than or different than a sentient beings mind, there there is a fallacy of the tathāgatagarbha being something like an atman. But there is no atman in the tathāgatagarbha theory, not really. the supreme self, (paramātma) is explained very clearly in the Uttaratantra:
The supreme self is the pacification of the proliferations of self and and nonself.
But what does this mean? Asanga adds:
The perfection of self (ātmapāramitā) is known through two reasons: due to being free from proliferation of a self because of being free from the extreme of the non-buddhists and due to being free from the proliferation of nonself because of giving up the extreme of the śrāvakas.
He explains further:
From cultivating prajñāpāramita in order to turn away from seeing the five addictive aggregates as self, the non-existent self in which the others, the nonbuddhists, delight, one attains the result, the perfection of self. In this way all the others, the nonbuddhists, accept natureless things such as matter and so on as a self due to their being deceived by a characteristic of a self according to how those things are being apprehended, but that self never existed. 

The Tathāgata, on the other hand, has attained the supreme perfection of the selflessness of all phenomena through the wisdom that is in accord with just how things truly are, and though there is no self according to how he sees things, he asserts a self all the time because he is never deceived by the characteristic of a self that does not exist. Making the selfless into a self is like saying "abiding through the mode of nonabiding.
There are some people who, ignoring the Nirvana Sutra's admonition to rely on the meaning rather than on the words, fall headlong into eternalism, unable to parse the Buddha's profound meaning through addiction to naive literalism.

Tathagatagarbha is just a potential to become a buddha. When we say it is has infinite qualities, this is nothing more nor less than when the Vajrapañjara praises the so called "jewel-like mind":
The jewel-like mind is tainted with
evil conceptual imputations;
but when the mind is purified it becomes pure. 
Just as space cannot be destroyed,
just as is space, so too is the mind. 
By activating the jewel-like mind
and meditating on the mind itself, there is the stage of buddhahood, 
and in this life there will be sublime buddhahood.
There is no buddha nor a person
outside of the jewel-like mind,
the abode of consciousness is ultimate, 
outside of which there isn't the slightest thing. 
All buddhahood is through the mind...
Matter, sensation, perception
formations and consciousness
these all arise from the mind,
these [five] munis are not anything else.
Like a great wishfulfilling gem, 
granting the results of desires and goals, 
the pure original nature of the true state of the mind
bestows the result, Buddha's awakening
There is no other basis apart from this natural purity of the mind that is inseparable clarity and emptiness. We can call it whatever we want, but still this fact remains. The Lankāvatara rightly observes that tathāgatagarbha is just a name for emptiness and the ālayavijñāna for those afraid of emptiness. Jayānanda writes that ālayavijñāna is the mind that comprehends the basis, i.e. emptiness. How else can the mind be purified of evil conceptual imputations other than by realizing emptiness? Emptiness free from all extremes is the pure original nature of the true state of the mind, so why bother confusing oneself with all kinds of rhetoric? The mind itself has two aspects, emptiness and clarity, ka dag and lhun grub, and these are inseparable. This inseparable clarity and emptiness is call the ālaya in gsar ma and the basis in Nyingma. This also known as tathagatagarbha when it encased in afflictions, the dharmadhātu from its ultimate side, the ālayavijñāna from its relative side and so on. It really is not that complicated.

If the whole point of the Buddha's refuting of self only applied to the aggregates for the purpose of clearing the ground to deny a supreme self that is separate from the aggregates, then why is it that in the hundreds of passages when he applies the teachings of non-self to the aggregates he never follows it up by giving a teaching denying a universal self? He could have easily said "Form etc are all impermanent, dukkha, and non-self, but there is no reality beyond them that is permanent, blissful, and actually IS a self"? If the whole point of rejecting the aggregates as self were to deny the true self, then the Buddha must have been horribly inept to not just say so.


Malcolm wrote:
Why would the Buddha negate a self which is wholly unrelated to a person? Such an abstract self bears no need for negation because no thinking person would imagine that there was such a self that was somehow separate from their body or mind. The Buddha would be horribly inept to refute something that was totally without any basis. If the point of the Buddha's teaching was to identify some supreme self, why did he not merely come out and say so? It is not like the Buddha was a cagey gambler who kept is cards close to his chest.

Indeed, in the Sutta Nipatta, the Buddha is reported to have said of arhats, that when someone goes out, attains nirvana, there is nothing left by virtue of which their nonexistence can be discussed.

The continuing abstraction of the ultimate self in Hinduism is just a result of the continued and persistent  Buddhist negation of any such entity. There is also the fact that Hindu opponents of Buddhism continually castigate Buddhists for nihilism. How can so many centuries of Buddhists have gotten it so wrong. Why are there no awakened Buddhists returning to tell us how wrong we all have it?

At any rate, Padmasambhava and other Buddhists who did live during the time when Advaita was in vogue did in fact refute it.

David Reigle said:
Yes, Śāntarakṣita devoted verses 328-335 of his 3,646 verse Tattvasamgraha to a refutation of Advaita. Well worth reading. He says that their error is slight (alpa), since they accept jñāna only (jñāna-mātra), which is reasonable (yukti), but that their error is in holding jñāna to be permanent (nitya). As we know, jñāna is in Tibetan ye shes. Some of the Tibetan schools, including Dzogchen if I am not mistaken, hold ye shes to be eternal.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, some gzhan stong pas might erroneously hold this view, but it is not the view of Dzogchen. In point of fact, the Rig pa rang shar tantra, one of the most important tantras on Dzogchen explicitly rejects Shankara's views by name, as well as those of Kumarila.

Anway, the view of Dzogchen is that wisdom arises from prajñā, as the Rig pa rang shar also states:
All phenomena arise from within
the self-originated wisdom (prajñā) that is not a phenomenon. 
Pristine consciousness (jñāna) arises from that.
To go into how that prajñā self originates is a little beyond our scope, but suffice to say it arises on the basis of a stirring of a vāyu which propels a jnāta which is neutral; and when this jñāta knows its appearances as its own state, it becomes a self-originated prajñā, self-originated because its knowledge of its own state did not come from outside, not because it is something that just pops into existence all of a sudden. And needless to say, if this same jnāta does not recognize its own state, it becomes avidyā.

If it is asked what is difference between this dharmakāya and the paramātma [bdag pa dam pa] asserted in such ways as nonconceptual, permanent and unchanging, that [paramātma] they explain as subtle because it possesses the quality of subtly, is explained as gross because it possesses the quality of grossness, as unique because it possess the quality of uniqueness and as pervading near and far because it goes everywhere. The dharmakāya on the other hand is neither subtle nor gross, is not unique, is not near and is not far because it is not a possessor of said qualities and because it does not exist in a place.

There are two approaches to rainbow body. Both involve exhausting the karma of the elements in the body, that is all rainbow body is, whether via the new Tantras or the old.

We have fantasies for eons about which one is faster, but as far as I know, they both take a lot of practice. To achieve rainbow body via thogal an average practitioner will have to go into strict retreat for 12 years, or so the texts say. So, who among us is going to do that?

I then checked the 16-volume Negi Tibetan-Sanskrit Dictionary, which gives only the same reference to the Amarakośa. Between the two multi-volume Tibetan-Sanskrit dictionaries, a large number of Buddhist texts are covered, but far from all.

I then did a search on all five of the GRETIL files of the Pañcaviṃśatisāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā, covering the entire Sanskrit text of the 25,000 line Perfection of Wisdom. The word paramātma does not occur in it. Nor does it occur in the 8,000 line version. Nor in the portions of the 100,000 line version that have so far been input.

It may be that we have to use references to brahman, as Dzogchungpa suggested.

Compare:

'In the seen will be merely what is seen; in the heard will be merely what is heard; in the sensed will be merely what is sensed; in the cognized will be merely what is cognized.' In this way you should train yourself, Bahiya.

With:

"The unseen seer, the unheard hearer, the unthought thinker, the uncognized cognizer... There is no other seer but he, no other hearer, no other thinker, no other cognizer. This is thy self, the inner controller, the immortal...." Brhadaranyaka Upanishad 3.7.23.

It's funny bc I've saying for years that all these paradigms are malleable and that sarma has everything DC has. They just keep it in the oral tradition. Malcolm would be on his DC superiority kick.

One point stands out from this era that still registers with me as supremely useful for us Westerners who are very very intelligent we just have heavy burdens and no time. We need some way to accelerate if we can. Why? Not for cool points. We need help and it has to work at work. And work here is serious. Mistakes can land you in court.

Longchenpa explains how the clear light yoga of nyingthig makes use of only the central channel which is pure and does not gather winds from chakras but leaves them to dissipate in their own place thus reducing the danger of jacking up the intensity of emotions which is a big danger with methods dealing with the chakras. So he successfully isolates the precise point that distinguishes nyingthig.

So rainbows and evaporating cadavers aside, this method give someone a chance to experience the clear light innate Buddha within without having to do a complicated sadhana, one, and, two, without creating dangerous obstacles related to loud emotional energy. Of course obstacle come up like diseases and such, and the anuyoga yidams related with DC help a lot for that.

Sure from a scholar's or realized person's standpoint this or that round up to the same thing. But from a practitioner standpoint especially a beginner, knowing ahead of time that some two step method will crank up the anxiety level might help them decide "hey in my line of work I can't have that," and what a godsend a method that doesn't is.

Maybe on this board it sounds cool to wax poetical but folks need to go off board and go outside more. Interact with folks while engaging the teachings and see how folks react to you. See how you react with them. That's the pudding where the proof is. Do they like you, feel comfortable around you? Can you set someone at ease? Can you be kind? If not don't feel bad abt it just ganapuja, Vajrasattva, go to an empowerment, you know refresh the blessings and try again. If you are lucky enough to meet a DC master then you have a great opportunity to put an end to anxiety, depression, weakness, etc.

At least for me the two stage stuff did jack up me emotions. The teacher said this was a blessing and had me examining my feeling in the moment. This made me jumpy. It hurt my performance at work a lot. But somehow the lineage kept me blessed. I won awards and business was great. But I didn't feel right. I started following DC teachers and that helped some. But it was so hard like Malcolm said to sort out which scheme to follow. There are so many. In the meantime we got six yogas of Naropa from a higher master and the tummo thing began to work to help deep relaxation instead of jumpy. So for a while I was at a loss which was working. I took time off from sarma kinda went back to my feral state and that's when Guhyagarbha began a year of all DC. This helped to distinguish.

So if you get a DC empowerment, reading transmission and the experiences are clearly explained with a good translator, you definitely can practice in that style and it will help. That is a big if bc these things are very rare, and rarer and rarer still are all these elements together.

I did not disparage Nyingma, I just pointed out what is obvious to anyone who spends time reading Dzogchen tantras, i.e., that Dzogchen tantras themselves spends reams of paper criticizing lower yanas, and then successively, upper levels of ati criticize the lower levels of ati yoga until we get to yangti, where it seems that the triumphalism peters out since there is nothing else to say. Well, that is until some westerner invents:

Ati lite™ New and Improved! With more flavors than ever!

Then you wind up like some people do (not referring to anyone here), not doing anything at all because they think Dzogchen is not about doing anything, lost in a net of proliferation.

If we are honest with ourselves, we will recognize that the likely hood of any of us attaining the ultimate fruits of any of these systems that we hold up as the bee's knees in this lifetime is very small. Maybe some of us will attain realization in the bardo. But rainbow body? In this life? Among we here who are posting now? I don't think so. And that is not a criticism of any lineage. So you have to take my criticisms for what they are, antidotes to what I perceive as rhetorical excesses. Have I committed my own fair share? Of course, its the internet. I understand the impulse to praise what one is into. Are Dzogchen teachings amazing? Sure. Is Lamdre amazing? Sure. Is Naro Chodrug amazing? Absolutely, Sadanga yoga and Kalacakra? Of course, etc., etc.

For this reason, it is a little strange to say that oh this teachings is more experiential than that teaching. All teachings are experiential, as are all empowerments.

As far as obstacles go, well, Virupa's advice is to take the obstacles as the attainments, and the faults as the qualities. This of course does not mean that we should be crazy people.

In my opinion, people over play the "madness" element in Vajrayāna, not understanding the different levels of the path and when it is appropriate to engage in this or that conduct and when it is not. Conduct is a reflection of realization, not obstacles. There is a vast difference between someone who is merely behaving like Vajryāna hot mess and someone's whose conduct is a result realizing heat....

On the other hand, when it is discussed from the point of view of experience, it should be understood more in terms of an affirming negation.
Here HHDL is rephrasing the Shentong position on how Madhyamaka is for talking about emptiness from an intellectual perspective, and Shentong from an experiential perspective.

OK, I see, thanks.

So how are the 2 truths presented in gzhan stong? Is it similar to Nyingma 9-yana system?

Malcolm wrote:
The three own natures are mapped onto the two truths in the following way:

Ultimate truth = the perfected nature (parinispanna)
Correct relative truth  =  the dependent nature (paratantra)
False relative truth = the imagined nature (parikalpita)

Ultimate truth, parinispanna, is held to be empty of the dependent and the relative. According to this system in general, whatever is held to be ultimate is unconditioned, permanent and so on, and is empty of the conditioned, impermanent and so on.

So, it is a very dualistic perspective in many regards, positing all kinds of dualisms such as empty/not-empty; impermanent/permanent; conditioned/unconditioned; and so on.

In reality, according to the Maitreya, Asanga and Vasubandhu's treatises, the perfected nature is merely the absence of the imagined in the dependent nature. So, the two truths theory does not really work well if you try to map it to the three own natures as they are explained by the three great Yogacara masters.

If you understand the dependent nature as the union of the two truths — in this case the imagined is the relative truth; the perfected, the ultimate truth; which corresponds to Candrakirti's observation that all things bear two natures, one relative, one ultimate. However, there is no classical presentation like this anywhere, AFAIK, and definitely not within gzhan stong.

Why is rang stong said to err towards nihilism? I don't get this common remark by gzhan stong pas. Rang stong is actually a realist position, they only limit their emptiness to svabhavas, very similar to Sautrantikas, so it is very confusing to see them claim to be Prasangika.

Also I always found this terminology of translating inherent existence or some other variant very confusing until I learned that it was just svabhava/rang bzhin. Using the Sanskrit really makes everything clearer.

Well, first of all, Gelugpas are not rang stong pas, even Khedrupje rejects this appellation for their view and heaps ridicule on it.

Second of all, the reason why Gelug view leans towards nihilism is the insistence that ultimate is merely "the emptiness that is the absence of true existence in things". Hence they assert the ultimate is a mere nonexistence, and that leans towards ucchedavada.

Anyway it's not as if Shentong is completely absent from Sakya. Deshung R. was a very important Sakyapa. I think Malcolm personally just doesn't like it because it's too close to Hinduism, and that freaks him out.

Malcolm wrote:
Nope, gzhan stong is not completely absent from Sakya. However, there are important differences between the gzhan stong of Shakya Chogden and the gzhan stong of Dolbupa. These have been summarized in a short text by Taranatha.

The long and short of it is that Shakya Chogden considered wisdom relative and conditioned, among many other things. Shakya Chogden's main aim, at least one point in his long and varied career (he shifted his views many times and is therefore perhaps the most interesting Sakya scholar of the classical period) was to show that all the treatises of Maitreta were definitive and not in contradiction with Madhyamaka.

However, in general within Sakya the view of gzhan stong is generally considered to be incompatible with the practice of Lamdre since the notion that the ultimate is empty of the relative, with the former truly existing and the latter not existing at all, is incompatible with the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana; the view of gzhan stong is considered to be a misinterpretation of the doctrines of the Yogacara school (this is a point of view shared with Tsongkhapa); the view of gzhan stong is considered to lean toward the extreme of existence, just as Tsongkhapa's views are considered to be lean toward the view of nonexistence.

Now then, gzhan stong scholars in Tibet don't freak me out at all; then there are westerners who have naively jumped on the gzhan stong bandwagon who often proclaim a view of Buddhahood that is really indistinguishable from how Hindus conceive of brahmin because these people do not know how to understand words like permanent, stable and unchanging. These people don't freak me out either, I just feel they have been very misled by what has been up till now very poor scholarship on the subject.

That has changed, but still, when we talk about this issue, rather than talk about what is actually a unique feature of gzhan stong teachings, the way in which they present the two truths, people would rather talk about infinite unconditioned qualities of tathāgatagarbha, as if that was really the issue at stake. It isn't really the issue.

As the Buddha said in the Nirvana Sūtra above:
If it is explained "tathagatagarbha is empty." The immature cultivate the dread of annihilation.The intelligent know that permanence, stability and immutability exists as a mere illusion.
People could start, for example, by understanding the Buddha, Maitreya, Asanga, and so on were not gzhan stong pas.

If they are non-fiction, which I believe them to be, then obviously it can easily be said that they are "empty of anything other than their own qualities". The English "existent", as I've said before, is misleading and I think inappropriate as it suggests something manifest or material. Obviously that is not the case. Going to my thesaurus, I propose as alternates: genuine, authentic, valid, true, unmistaken, actual, and non-fiction. If someone else has a better thesaurus I'm open to more terms.

The emptiness of other, the emptiness that is not empty, as the Nirvana sutra puts its, is not the profound emptiness of freedom from extremes. It is not more profound than the emptiness taught in the Cullasuññata sutta where the Buddha says a village is empty of a city because the people are not there. etc. Also the Buddha repeats this emptiness example in the Nirvana Sutra.

However the Buddha also teaches profound emptiness in the Nirvana Sutra (Sanskrit recension translated into Tibetan). It is important to know the difference between the trivial emptiness of the so called affirming negation the emptiness of free of extremes.
One must know that the teaching of the Buddha is "this is the middle way." The Bhagavān Buddha teaches the path as the middle way that is free from the extremes of permanence and annihilation. Some fools however, confused about the Buddha's teaching, like those with weak digestive heat who consume butter, quickly come to have views about the two extremes. Though existence is not established, also nonexistence is not established. 

For example, just as when the elements of pitta and so on become disturbed and have mutual conflicts, doctors pacify pitta for the illness of pitta, remove vata when vata predominates, eliminate kapha in those with kapha, and apply combination remedies for those with combination disorders. Without causing mutual conflicts also the happines [of the patient] improves. Like a doctor, infinite illnesses of afflictions are removed by extremes and perfect health is restored. 

So called "perfect health" is the tathāgatgarbha, i.e. the so called "buddhadhātu", but it is free from all [other] dhātus, being permanent, stable and persistent. Though the intelligent are not attached to existence, also so called "nonexistence" arises from telling lies. Silent about called "existence," they also do not make it into a premise. They also do not dispute it. These are to be understood as natural dharmatā. 

Fools who do not understand words, "While the seed of happiness exists in my body, this conflicts with permanence because suffering is shown." Grasping everything, these immature ones think "my body is not stable." If impermanence is explained, the immature think it is like a pot made by a potter. Since the intelligent on the other hand think "The seed of dharmakāya exists in my body," they do not grasp to everything. If selflessness is demonstrated, the immature grasp to the explanation thinking there is no self. The intelligent on the other hand think "The [self] exists conventionally, there is no doubt. If it is explained "tathagatagarbha is empty." The immature cultivate the dread of annihilation.The intelligent know that permanence, stability and immutability exists as a mere illusion.
158/a—159/a Lhasa edition

So here in the Nirvana Sutra we can clearly see that the Buddha refers to permanence, stability and immutability as being illusory. What does it mean to be illusory? Not real, but apparent. The Buddha continues:
When liberation is demonstrated, the immature grasp the thought, after the Buddhas are liberated, they become nonexistent. The intelligent know that the Buddha has come and the Buddha has gone, and say "The lion of humans arrived."  The immature grasp ignorance conditioning formation as a duality. The intelligent understand there is no difference between ignorance and knowledge, they are nondual. The immature grasp consciousness conditioned formation as a duality. The intelligent know that there is no difference between the formation and the absence of formations, they are nondual. Likewise, the immature grasp all virtue and nonvirtue as two different things. The intelligent understand them as nondual...the immature cultivate the idea that in the tathāgatagarbha, everything conditioned is impermanent. The intelligent understand this as nondual. That is the nature of the intelligent. The immature grasp all phenomena as nonself in Buddha's explanation of nonself. The intelligent understand that "self exists" and "there is no་self are nondual, that is the nature of the intelligent. The tathāgatagarbha praised by buddhas beyond measure was explained by me in the Sarvapuṇya-samuccaya sūtra, in which it is held that the "self exists" and "the self does not exist" are nondual. 

Son of a good family, in the appearance of entering into the nonduality in the Sarvapuṇya-samuccaya sūtra and the great Prajñāpāramita sūtra, I have explained the "self exists" and "the self does not exist" as nondual, remember this!"
159/a —160/a

So, here the main point is not to get hung up on the words, permanent, stable, immutable, which are just illusions, nor should one get hung up on self and nonself, knowing that self is just a convention. All in all, pretty standard Buddhist fare.

I have. I'm referring to the way it is presented. For example the 3rd requires a consort. That don't happen at the ceremony. What happens is simulacrum. Of course due to the blessing of the lineage one can connect directly with the teachers state in the 4th. In Rigpa'i tsal wang it is describes what the light is about. In mahayoga or Anu it is presented but not fully explained. It's this subtlety of explanation that makes it special in Nyingma. I know hardly anyone gets anything. That's karma. But some do. So that's what matters for the lineage. BTW HHST gave a perfect wang in Richmond. In a Kagyu-Nyingma-Sakya-Bonpo aka Vajrayanist.

Empowerments are related to practices. And there are all kinds of rig pa'i tshal dbangs, from ones that just hold up one to two items to those that give full fledged explanations of various aspects of the path [the kind you are talking about]. So it is really not enough to say "Oh, the rig pa'i tshal dbang is the best thing since sliced bread." You have to be very specific. There are lots of rig pa'i tshal dbang that are no different than the fourth in brevity.

Of course the GZT goes all out, is like a kitchen sink of dbangs, elaborate, unelaborate, very unelaborate, extremely unelaborate, and it does not stop there, I know since I was at the one in Virginia, but...dbangs are one thing, practice is another.

(And, while I am getting every closer to putting out the Vimalamitra book, there are reams of stuff yet to edit and publish from the GZT.)

Frankly, in my opinion, claiming that this thing and that thing is more profound than this and that is a bit of an error. For example, where you aware that in Kālacakra there is an outer four empowerments, an inner four empowerments and so on? Or that in Lamdre there are many empowerments, not just a few, so in reality, when you make the claims that you do, you cheapen Nyingma by falsely elevating it.

Nyingmapas like to claim their teachings as the highest thing on Buddha's green earth, but when you get right down to it, it is all just a complicated mess of ever conflicting systems, with each "higher" level saying the last one is shit. It is really a lot of proliferation and I have studied it and practiced it in detail for 20 years now.

If you say that Tathagatagarbha does not exist primordially, somehow, in the continuua of sentient beings, you are saying Buddhahood is caused, and therefore "conditioned."

Malcolm wrote:
The Uttaratantra states:
Unconditioned, effortless, 
not realized through other conditions,
endowed with wisdom, compassion and power, 
buddhahood is endowed with two benefits.
But what does this really all mean?

When we examine Asanga's comments on this, he states:
When these are summarized, buddhahood is described with eight qualties. If it is asked what those eight qualities are, they are unconditioned, effortless, not realized through other conditions, wisdom, compassion, power, the abundance of one's own benefit and the abundance of others' benefit. [Buddhahood] is unconditioned because it is the nature of lacking a beginning, middle and end. It is called "effortless" because peace is endowed with the dharmakāya. It is not realized through other conditions because each person must realize it for themselves. It is wisdom because those three things are realized. [Buddhahood] is compassionate because [the Buddha] shows the path. It is powerful because it is free from suffering and affliction. The former three [unconditioned, effortless and not realized through other conditions] are for one's own benefit; the latter three [wisdom, compassion and power] are for others' benefit. 

In that regard, the conditioned is fully understood as arising somewhere, and also understood as abiding and perishing. Because those do not exist [arising, abiding and perishing], buddhahood itself is unconditioned without a beginning, middle and an end. This is seen as a differentiation made through the dharmakāya. Because all proliferation and concepts are pacified, [buddhahood] is effortless [lhun gyis grub].  Buddhahood is not realized through other conditions because it is realized through wisdom oneself produced. Here, udayo [to produce] is not the arising of a desire for realization. As such, the tathāgata is unconditioned due to the truth, out of the characteristics of non-engagement, all the activities of the buddha effortlessly engaged in without impediment and without interruption for as long as samsara exists
So let us parse this out a little bit.

Asanga states in his commentary on the Uttaratantra:
...the conditioned is understood as arising somewhere, and also understood as abiding and perishing. Because those do not exist [arising, abiding and perishing], buddhahood itself is unconditioned without a beginning, middle and an end.
Buddhahood is unconditioned because the trio of arising, abiding and perishing are false. Not because in contrast to things that arise, abide and perish, buddhahood does not arise, abide and perish.

Buddhahood however has a cause, as he writes:
Buddhahood is not realized through other conditions because it is realized through wisdom oneself produced.
Buddhahood is also effortless, because, as he writes:
...all proliferation and concepts are pacified, [buddhahood] is effortless [lhun gyis grub]...As such, the tathāgata is unconditioned due to the truth; and from the characteristics of non-engagement, all the activities of the buddha are engaged in effortlessly [lhun grub], without impediment and without interruption for as long as samsara exists
As for tathāgatagarbha always existing in the continuums of sentient beings; if you think somehow tathāgatagarba is something other than or different than a sentient beings mind, there there is a fallacy of the tathāgatagarbha being something like an atman. But there is no atman in the tathāgatagarbha theory, not really. the supreme self, (paramātma) is explained very clearly in the Uttaratantra:
The supreme self is the pacification of the proliferations of self and and nonself.
But what does this mean? Asanga adds:
The perfection of self (ātmapāramitā) is known through two reasons: due to being free from proliferation of a self because of being free from the extreme of the non-buddhists and due to being free from the proliferation of nonself because of giving up the extreme of the śrāvakas.
He explains further:
From cultivating prajñāpāramita in order to turn away from seeing the five addictive aggregates as self, the non-existent self in which the others, the nonbuddhists, delight, one attains the result, the perfection of self. In this way all the others, the nonbuddhists, accept natureless things such as matter and so on as a self due to their being deceived by a characteristic of a self according to how those things are being apprehended, but that self never existed. 

The Tathāgata, on the other hand, has attained the supreme perfection of the selflessness of all phenomena through the wisdom that is in accord with just how things truly are, and though there is no self according to how he sees things, he asserts a self all the time because he is never deceived by the characteristic of a self that does not exist. Making the selfless into a self is like saying "abiding through the mode of nonabiding.
There are some people who, ignoring the Nirvana Sutra's admonition to rely on the meaning rather than on the words, fall headlong into eternalism, unable to parse the Buddha's profound meaning through addiction to naive literalism.

Tathagatagarbha is just a potential to become a buddha. When we say it is has infinite qualities, this is nothing more nor less than when the Vajrapañjara praises the so called "jewel-like mind":
The jewel-like mind is tainted with
evil conceptual imputations;
but when the mind is purified it becomes pure. 
Just as space cannot be destroyed,
just as is space, so too is the mind. 
By activating the jewel-like mind
and meditating on the mind itself, there is the stage of buddhahood, 
and in this life there will be sublime buddhahood.
There is no buddha nor a person
outside of the jewel-like mind,
the abode of consciousness is ultimate, 
outside of which there isn't the slightest thing. 
All buddhahood is through the mind...
Matter, sensation, perception
formations and consciousness
these all arise from the mind,
these [five] munis are not anything else.
Like a great wishfulfilling gem, 
granting the results of desires and goals, 
the pure original nature of the true state of the mind
bestows the result, Buddha's awakening
There is no other basis apart from this natural purity of the mind that is inseparable clarity and emptiness. We can call it whatever we want, but still this fact remains. The Lankāvatara rightly observes that tathāgatagarbha is just a name for emptiness and the ālayavijñāna for those afraid of emptiness. Jayānanda writes that ālayavijñāna is the mind that comprehends the basis, i.e. emptiness. How else can the mind be purified of evil conceptual imputations other than by realizing emptiness? Emptiness free from all extremes is the pure original nature of the true state of the mind, so why bother confusing oneself with all kinds of rhetoric? The mind itself has two aspects, emptiness and clarity, ka dag and lhun grub, and these are inseparable. This inseparable clarity and emptiness is call the ālaya in gsar ma and the basis in Nyingma. This also known as tathagatagarbha when it encased in afflictions, the dharmadhātu from its ultimate side, the ālayavijñāna from its relative side and so on. It really is not that complicated.

There are all kinds of people who do not take issue with what the tathāgatagarbha sūtra say (like Gorampa, for example) who have all kinds of issues with Dolbupa's overly literal interpretation of them.

As far as the other things goes, he is not saying that buddhanature is not a direct perception, he just thinks that it is a mistaken to say that only buddhas can have such a direct perception, he thinks (erroneously) that also tenth stage bodhisattvas can have such a direct perception (even though it is clearly stated that their perception of tathāgatagarbha is generic i.e. abstract, and not direct).

I don't see him disparaging Secret Mantra. We are not talking about anything very specific, so I don't see the issue.

Everyone classfies Guhyagarba as a Mahāyoga tantra. Some people sub-classify it ati of mahā.

If you are above the clouds there is absolutely no difference between a stormy day and clear weather.

The Dharmakāya produces form bodies for sentient beings — did you ever ask yourself how?
Funny, I was going to ask you the same question.

So let us start with "Dharmakaya produces…" Really? Nothing produces something? Hmmm...

Malcolm wrote:
Right, this actually only happens from the side of sentient being. In reality, the dharmakāya does not produce anything. The Mahāyāna Uttaratantra states:
Just as the reflection of Indra appears
in a pure ground of sapphire, [435/a]
likewise, the reflection of the body of the Munindra
arises in the pure ground of the mind of migrating beings. 
The reflection that arises or subsides for migrating beings is engaged
through the power of whether their minds are permeated or not with taints,
just like the appearance of the reflection [of Indra] in the worlds
is in the same way not seen as existing or not existing.
The Vajracchedikā Sūtra states:
Whoever sees me as form, 
whoever knows me as sound,
those people who apprehend me
incorrectly do not see me, [411/b]
and so do not see the dharmakāya.
The buddhas are dharmatā.
The guides are the dharmakāya.
Since dharmatā is unknowable,
it cannot be known.
So you have to ask yourself what dharmatā is. The Saptaśatikā-prajñāpāramitā Sūtra states:
Inconceivable wisdom is the wisdom of the buddhas. The absence of perception of any phenomenon is the wisdom of the buddhas…If it is asked why, the omniscience with the mode of the nonexistence of wisdom in the ultimate is the wisdom of the buddha.
The Mahāyāna Uttaratantra states:
Just as space is nothing at all, invisible,
imperceptible, unsupported, 
totally beyond sight, 
formless, indemonstrable
and cannot be seen
even though one looks high and low,
likewise, even though one looks for buddha 
everywhere, he isn’t there.

Your position above is not more profound than the Uttaratantra, which of course makes a distinction between impure, pure/impure and pure, from the perspective of sentient beings, bodhisattvas, and buddhas. No one ever said the path was additive, it is only subtractive, gathering the two accumulations for example, means just that one is removing the two obscurations. When one is obscured, one is impure; when on the path, especially the aryan path, pure/impure; and when one attains buddhahood, pure. It does not mean that one has in fact actually removed or added anything. Nevertheless, these so called buddha qualities both can be considered naturally perfected, and they also are produced by a process of transformation and there is no contradiction between these two things.

Ok, so then the Dharmakaya is a solid object? Or a convenient fiction used as upaya? Wow.

Malcolm wrote:
Depends on how you are defining it. For example, in Secret Mantra, among the seven limbs of three kāyas, dharmakāya is the limb of the absence of inherent existence. Sambhogakāya has three limbs: union, great bliss and perfect enjoyments. Nirmānakāya has three limbs great compassion, the uninterrupted stream of the wheel of activities, and never ceasing.

In sūtra, dharmakāya is the two-fold omniscience that comes about from gathering the accumulation of wisdom.

This however does not mean that there is some platonic ultimate that exists separate from the relative phenomena of the world. The three kāyas function in the world for sentient beings. The dharmakāya produces form bodies for sentient beings — did you ever ask yourself how? Or did you think that the dharmakāya, sambhogakāya and nirmanakāya were something like the father, son and holy ghost?

it is not a question of "believing what I want," Stephen Hodge also has doubts about the veracity of later portions of the translation by Dharmakṣema. The version translated by by Fa-hsien appears to be the original.
Sure it is a question of what you believe......and likewise many scholars, historians and Buddhists think the Vajrayana Tantras are entirely dubious in origin and in many cases contain very perverse teachings if token literally.

Also the first 17 chapters of the Dharmakeshema version Correspond to the Original Faxian version, my quote came from chapter 8

Second I find it hard to believe you like the faxian version better you know seeing as the Faxian version uses the term JIVATMAN instead of Atman it teaches directly the term Soul.

The problem lies when one conflates the language of the tathatagarbha teachings, the language of yogacara and the language of madhyamaka. The ancient yogacarins in Indian took virtually no interest in tathāgatagarbha theory devoting only a total of two commentaries to the subject: the Uttaratantra and the subcommentary on that by Asanga. Further proof, is that Madhyamakas such as Bhavavieka and Chandrakirti treast the subject of tathāgatagarbha theory with much more interest then Asanga, Vasuubandhu and so on. We do not really find consistent commentarial treatment of tathāgatagarbha theory until the Vajrayāna commentaries dating from the ninth century onward. Even here it is not systematic.

conebeckham said:
Mahdyamika in the classical sense denies the ability of conceptual mind to encompass reality.  Shentong also does the same thing.   The only thing Shentong, as I understand it, posits is an awareness which is beyond description, also beyond the ability of conceptual mind to encompass reality--but in that sense, it does posit "something" other than "bare emptiness" as an "ultimate."

Malcolm wrote:
And thus gzhan stong slips off the other side of the horse while trying avoid the extreme of annihilation. Such an assertion of existence in the ultimate cannot be considered free from extremes, because it is an extreme. This is why the Buddha states in the Ārya-saṃvṛitiparamārthasatyanirdeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:
Devaputra: ultimate truth is beyond the range of the omniscient wisdom endowed with the supreme of all aspects. However one describes ultimate truth, it is not like that.
And as Gorampa states:
Other than the need for the existence of a middle path which avoids two extremes in all three vehicles, as explained in the Ratnavali, the system of Mādhyamikas must be free from the extreme of permanence because the ultimate asserted in the lower vehicles is not established, and free from the extreme of annihilation since the causes and results of action are not denied in the relative. 

Also based upon this Mahāyāna, since one meditates having brought together the trio of the special view that reality’s own nature is free from the extremes of the dualistic grasping of existence and nonexistence and so on, compassion in relation to sentient beings, and the development of Mahāyāna bodhicitta, at the time of the final result while never moving from the state of the dharmadhātu free from all proliferation one will effortlessly produce the benefit of sentient beings throughout all of space.
There cannot be a Madhyamaka better than this, nor a result better than this.

Malcolm wrote:
Right, so you did not even answer the question.

As a basic definition, nirvana, space and so on are included in "all phenomena." In fact, the Śatasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā, etc., state:
All phenomena are included with the category of suchness, those cannot go beyond that category. If it asked why, Subhuti no coming or coming can be perceived in suchness. Subhuti, all phenomena are within these categories: the dharmadhātu, are the limit of reality, uniformity and inconceivability.
And:
Subhuti, when categorized, all phenomena are the nature of being unreal. Subhuti, in the same way, also all phenomena are nature of emptiness, all phenomena are the nature of signlessness, all phenomena are the nature of aspirationalessness. Subhuti, in the same way also, all phenomena are the nature of suchness, all phenomena are the nature of the limit of reality, all phenomena are the nature of dharmadhātu.
This being so, it is ludicrous to assert that the ultimate is empty of all relative phenomena. Such an assertion directly contradicts the words of the Buddha. It is one thing to claim "tathāgatagarbha is empty of adventitious afflictions." It is quite another to claim that the ultimate is empty of all relative phenomena. The ultimate is merely the emptiness of all phenomena, there is no other ultimate that can be found.

Umm, no, that is not what gzhan stong is. This is how it is defined:

Dharmatā, the thoroughly established, the ultimate truth, is not empty of its own nature, but because it is empty of imputed and other-dependent entities, relative entities, conditioned phenomena, it is empty of other entities. That is the true unperverted emptiness, ultimate truth, dharmakāya, [3/b] the limit of the real, suchness, and emptiness endowed with the supreme of all aspects. The powers, major and minor marks and so on are the unconditioned qualities that abide in that from the beginning.
You do realise your quote is in agreement with what I am saying right?

All your quote us saying is the ultimate truth which is the Buddha attributes(as I stated in the queen srimala Sutra) is empty of imputed and other-dependent entities, relative entities, conditioned phenomena, it is empty of other entities which are adventious defilements (which again was what was taught in the Queen Srimala Sutra I quoted)

Here is some more info to add to yours

The Moutain Doctrine Tibet’s Fundamental Treatise on Other-Emptiness and the Buddha Matrix By: Dolpopa.
Moreover the Angulimala Sutra says:
“Manjushri, an empty home in a built-up city is called empty due to the absence of humans. A pot is empty due to the absence of water. A river is empty due to water not flowing. Is a village that is without householders called “empty, empty?” Or are the households empty in all respects? They are not empty in all respects; they are called empty due to the absence of humans. Is a pot empty in all respects? It is not empty in all respects; it is called “empty” due to the absence of water. Is a river empty in all respects? It is not empty in all respects; it is called “empty” because water is not flowing. Similarly, liberation is not empty in all respects; it is called “empty” because of being devoid of all defects. A Buddha, a supermundane victor, is not empty but is called “empty” because of being devoid of defects and due to the absence of humanness and godhood that have ten of millions of afflictive emotions.
Alas, venerable Manjushri, acting out the behavior of a bug, you do not know the real meaning of empty and non-empty. The naked ones” also meditate on all as empty. Do not say anything, you bug of the naked ones!

[Dolpopa’s Commentary]
The passage from “The Buddha is like space” through “How could you, Angulimala, understand/ Empty nothingness!”which indicates, in accordance with the assertions of some, that everything is a self-emptiness of nothingness is an introduction by Manjushri. It leads to Angulimala’s delineating the difference between self-emptiness and other-emptiness, despite the fact that Manjushri actually knows the difference.
Then, using the example of hail-stone becoming non-existent upon melting, he teaches that the final liberation, Buddhahood, is not empty,This teaches that the ultimate supermundane truth, the body of attributes,is not empty of its own entity. Using the example of an empty home, an empty vase, and an empty river, he teaches an emptiness of all defects; this teaches that the final liberation is other-emptiness. All descriptions of non-emptiness/ “Liberation is not empty in all respects,” “A supermundane victor is not empty,” “Non-empty phenomena are other,” and so forth– mean that the ultimate noumenon is not itself empty of itself.

Malcolm wrote:
What you do not seem to understand is while the sūtra passages you are citing are noncontroversial, the gzhan stong interpretation Dolbupa applied to them in general is controversial for many reasons, but mostly having to do with his novel (and largely unprecedented) interpretation of the three own natures, his idea that the perfected nature (parinispanna) was empty of both the dependent (paratantra) and imputed (parikalpita) natures. In fact Maitreyanath, Asanga and Vasubandhu uniformly consider that the absence of the imputed in the dependent is the perfected. The second place where the gzhan stong view is found contradictory to Nāgārjuna is that if one follows the gzhan stong view, samsara and nirvana cannot be inseparable. Therefore, the statement by the Buddha in the Hevajra Tantra must be false:
This so-called "samsara," 
just this is nirvana.
Many other clear and unambiguous statements by the Buddha on the identity of samsara and nirvana must also be considered false. Not to mention Nāgārjuna's famed dictum:
Samsara is not the slightest bit different from nirvana, 
nirvana is not the slightest bit different from samsara;
whatever is the limit of nirvana, that is the limit of samsara, 
a difference between those two does not exist even slightly.
We can see that Vasubandhu agrees with this meaning in the Sūtrālaṃkārabhāṣya:
The meaning of nirvana being all-pervasive is that because samsara and peace (nirvana) have one taste due to one not having concepts about their faults and qualities, in the respect there is no difference between samsara and nirvana.
