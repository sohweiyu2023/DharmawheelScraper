Putin has been a bad hombre for over a decade. There’s nothing new about it. He has flexed his muscles in Georgia, Syria and Crimea in the past. The only difference now is that we’re talking about a bigger slice of land.

I think that the West, despite its bluster and threats of sanctions, has already more or less accepted that Ukraine will fall to Russia. I know that many Europeans see the cultural relationship between Russia and Ukraine as being close enough to actually make it “acceptable,” even though they might not admit it. This is pretty evident in all of the shoulder-shrugging and finger-wagging going on. One only needs to remember how quickly everyone got over the annexation of Crimea.

To call this the start of a new Cold War is to draw a much sharper line between Russia and the West than what exists: Most of Russia’s upper class and oligarchs are deeply integrated into the scene in London and New York. The gas pipeline to Germany is so integral that it perfectly explains why the new German PM has been so hesitant to strongly condemn Russia. There’s no real talk of kicking Russia out of Swift, which might actually hurt. Many politicians in both North America and Europe adore Putin and will try to impede attempts to punish him. He was even invited to the former Austrian foreign minister’s wedding in 2018.

Frankly, Putin is gonna take Ukraine, harsh words will be shared, but ultimately nothing will come of it. Ukraine is neither NATO nor EU. It is absolutely outside the Western sphere.

The question isn’t whether it’ll happen or not. The question is: will Ukraine be fully annexed or will a pro-Russian puppet government be established?

KristenM said:
Excellent points.

Putin is betting on the fact that the US doesn't have the will to fight and I've heard that Putin chose this time because he believes the US is weakened now in the same way that Russia was in the 1990's. Especially after the retreat of US forces from Afghanistan, Putin has felt emboldened. I'm not blaming any particular administration, but Russia sees the US as vulnerable.

Ukraine has a strategic importance that Crimea may not have and the domino effect of Ukraine falling into Russian hands does not bode well for the EU or the US. This takeover may be more costly that what the Russians or Europe are expecting. A long, drawn-out war and refugee crisis that Europe isn't ready for, just for starters. So, the US and its allies need to put their foot down or else they are doomed to lick the proverbial boot. How they do that, I've no idea.

According to Wisdom Library:

"In the Guna Karanda Vyuha it is written:

'When nothing else was, Sambhu was: that is the Self-Existent (svayambhu): and as he was before all, he is also called Adi-Buddha.'

The first system of Adi-Buddha was set up in Nepal  by a theistic school called Aisvarika, but was never generally adopted in Nepal or Tibet, and had practically no followers in China and Japan.

The Nepalese school supposed an Adi-Buddha infinite, omniscient, self-existing, without beginning and without end, the source and originator of all things, who by virtue of five sorts of wisdom (jnana) and by the exercise of five meditations (dhyana) evolved five Dhyani-Buddhas or Celestial Jinas called Anupapadaka, or 'without parents'.

When all was perfect void (maha-Sunyata)  the mystic syllable aum  became manifest, from which at his own will the Adi-Buddha was produced. At the creation of the world he revealed himself in the form of a flame which issued from a lotusflower, and in Nepal the Adi-Buddha is always represented by this symbol.

Svayambhu, or Adi-Buddha, was called Isvara by the Aisvarika, and Svabhava by the Svabhavika; but he was also given such special names as Vairocana, Vajrapani, Vajradhara, and Vajrasattva. In the Namasangiti (compiled before the tenth century a.d.) Manjusri, god of Transcendent Wisdom, is referred to as Adi-Buddha. "

Coming late here, with an ignorant layperson's question.

To the extent any Buddhists "believe in" Adi-Buddha, do they typically align him in any way with the Mahayana Buddha Body of the Dharmakaya...? In my understanding, the Dharmakaya is not personal, is not a Creator-deity, but is an endless expression of Buddha's super-consciousness and ever-operative compassion. If that is correct, can the Dharmakaya and Adi-Buddha be considered to be functionally equivalent at some level...?

To avoid them is the exercise that is considered as "10 wholesome deeds".

So, if you manage to spare killing an ant, it's a wholesome deed already. The focus is not on guilt and sin. Rather  "10 wholesome deeds" are viewed as a practice. Nobody is perfect in this from the beginning. It is a steady exercise.

"Mindfulness, skillfulness, transcendence, awareness" are helpers for this task, I think. They are deepened while practicing 10 wholesome deeds.

Adi means quite unequivocally "first", so it does give a wrong impression of a beginning in time.

“When those deities had come from Avalokiteśvara’s body, that bhagavat told the deity Maheśvara, ‘Maheśvara, in the kaliyuga, when beings have bad natures, you will be declared to be the primal deity who is the creator, the maker.

There is a bit of slippage in Tibetan texts between luminosity ('od gsal) and clarity (gsal ba), sometimes translated as cognizance. Generally the nature of the mind has three characteristics: it is empty, it is clear, and it is knowing. These characteristics are irreducible. They are also inseparable. "Clarity" in this context means that mind can receive impressions from objects without actually being affected by those impressions, like the surface of a mirror.

As for your first question, no.

There is explanation, but you need to receive the teaching.

Karmamudra practice in this system is associated with the Yab, Cakrasamvara, but not the yum, Vajrayogini. It is explained that karmamudra is not necessary for the realization of mahamudra in Yogini practice. This is probably based on the Kalacakra's rejection of karmamudra as well.

The  Mañjuśrīmulakalpa appeared in Chinese (983), and a bit later in Tibetan (1040+-). AFIK, the Nāmasaṃgīti was never translated into Chinese untl quite late, The version now in the Tibetan Kengyur was translated into Tibetan by RInchen Zangpo, but there exists a commentary attributed Vimalamitra with all the root verses, in a translation attributed to Nyak Jñānakumara. Davidson thinks it may have been composed around 700 CE. It is a work listed in the Ldan dkar catalogue. There is a Snying ma rgyud 'bum translation that differs from the one in the Kengyur. It is also found in Dunhuang. Anthony Tribe summarizes the scholarship on Namasaṃgīti here:

In May 1889, people living in Bukhara, a city that was then part of the Russian Empire, began sickening and dying. The respiratory virus that killed them became known as the Russian flu. It swept the world, overwhelming hospitals and killing the old with special ferocity.

Schools and factories were forced to close because so many students and workers were sick. Some of the infected described an odd symptom: a loss of smell and taste. And some of those who recovered reported a lingering exhaustion.

Just to clarify: Tibetan Buddhists believe that Tibetan Astrology is predictive of actual karma?

Malcolm wrote:
No.

It is basically a older version of five element calculation that comes from China. Rather than being based on the Indian elements of earth, water, fire, air, and space, it is based on the five phases of the Chinese system: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water, and the mother/son/enemy/friend relationship between these five. These five are mapped over the cycle of twelve years, beginning with the rat year and entering with the ox year, making for a sixty year cycle. Also the months, days, and hours are similarly divided. It also includes the magic square of saturn (mewa), and the eight trigrams, called parkha in Tibetan in its calculations.

It is used as a kind of almanac, a general way of knowing what are good days and bad, and so on, whether a year has a positive outlook for one or negative, and if negative, what kind of rites one needs to use to repel them. It has a broad use in Tibetan culture.

Myth has it that it was taught by Manjushri to Confucius, and it was then brought to Tibet. Like the I ching trigams and hexagrams, a tortoise figures largely in its origins. The various legends it has about the origins of the trigrams, etc., and the cosmic tortoise itself are very entertaining.

But no one believes it trumps karma.

You need to understand this point: all tantric teachings are connected with transmission. Without transmission it is like trying to use an appliance without electricity. If you have received an anuttarayoga tantra empowerment, you are then permitted to read tantras. But even then, you should only do so under the guidance of a teacher. This is the tradition. Of course, no one can see what you do in your house. But this is the proper way.

To read Dzogchen texts you need Dzogchen empowerments. General anuttara empowerments like Hevajra, etc., are not sufficient because the path is different.

The extremely rapid wisdom is free from all thoughts.

That being the case, because the self-originated wisdom, the basis of everything, is free from gradual progression, it is more rapid because of emphasizing nonprogression through mere seeing.

Malcolm wrote:
Alan Wallace might make that assertion, but I prefer to follow Garb Dorje comments on this passage from The Great Space of Vajrasattva:

The path of higher and higher purification 
is not consistent with the Dharma that is free of activity. 

Merit and wisdom are accumulated with thoughts that arise from the worldly. Objectives of traversing somewhere—gradual progress, the stages of bodhi, the abodes of Brahma and Indra, the universal emperor, and so on—are the path of affliction, and are bondage. Free from all activity, totally peaceful like space, bliss that is totally uniform and beyond limits, the natural great perfection cannot be thought, practiced, nor mediated. It does not depend on another by nature. For example, like the great king of wishfulfilling gems, it has the power to grant all treasures, whether Dharma or not Dharma.

If there were traversing a path, 
nothing would attained, like the boundary of space.

Also, the meaning commentary on the Cuckoo of Vidyā in the Bairo 'Gyud 'bum addresses the part of the title "single stage"

Since the suffering of effort is pacified because there is no progression in stages, there is the refreshment of great final solace without depending on arriving [somewhere].

As such, Dzogchen should be understood as an ekabhumi teaching.

However, it is not germane to the Tibetan Buddhist tradition. If we want to understand this from the Tibetan Buddhist point of view, we have to exclude imputing Jodo Shinshu, etc. interpretations, otherwise, we will not understand what Tibetan commentaries actually intend——and this is the main fault of the Halkias book and Cook paper.

The Tibetan version of the Sutra requires that sentient beings first must have generated Mahāyāna bodhicitta. Those who have not generated bodhicitta are necessarily excluded. Actually, conditions 18 and 19 are barely distinguishable, to the point where 19 is basically an elaboration of 18. For this reason, we see Tibetans selecting condition 19, with its four conditions as the critical point.

No. That is not possible. If it were possible, then there would be no sentient being who had heard Amitabha's name and ignored it. Why? Because presumably Amitabha's compassion would not permit it. But buddhas are not omnipotent. They do not have the power to change the karma of sentient beings by fiat, nor to plant thoughts in their minds. If they did, the consequence would be that since there is still suffering, buddhas would be incomparably cruel for not motivating all sentient beings to attain buddhahood by taking birth in Sukhavati. The inspiration for taking birth in Sukhavati necessarily depends on a sentient being's own karma and aspirations (smon lam).

The crucial point of course is that it’s our faith, through hearing Amitabha’s name, upon which  Dharmakara depends for the success of his aspiration. Without us, he has no buddhafield.

My point related to how the term is understood in Tibetan, and we can’t simply gloss over it. The point I am making, which is being astutely ignored here, is that Dharmakara didn’t make 48 aspirations. He made one. His aspiration was to purify a buddhafield, and he specified 48 conditions integral to his success in doing so. I am maintaining that distinction is critical in understanding why the Tibetan pure land traditions are quite uniform in their presentation from the eighth century onward.

As for Tibetan, for smon lam, Jeffrey Hopkins includes "vow; resolve," as does Valby, and Ives Waldo. For smon pa, JH has "resolve, vow."

I think the problem isn't really with the term "vow," it's that you may be assuming vow means saṃvāra or precept or something along those lines, when most people are using the term in a different way.

Malcolm wrote:
I was using a native Tibetan dictionary. The Valby dictionary is not reliable, it’s kind of like a pastiche of different translators. It’s not reflective of how Tibetans understand their own terminology at all. The native Tibetan etymology is as I explained it to you. No Tibetan considers a smon lam to be a sdom pa.

Maybe in Chinese, not in Tibetan. In Tibetan pranidhana is translated as smon lam.

Right, without the ring of faith, there is nothing for the hook of compassion to catch. But this is beside the point. The point I keep making is that Pure Landers are inclined to focus on thus or that part of Amitabha”s aspiration. We aren’t.

Zhen Li said:
It is clear that there is no inclination to focus on particular vows, but the point the reference to Mipham was making is that it is at least in the background that if not a focus on the 19th vow, then the practices of other vows are at least presumed to be subsumed under the practices specified there. You could say that the 19th vow appears to have the most detailed rundown of things you can do to be born, so from a certain point of view, it would be logical to say that is the clear area of focus in terms of finding out what it is that one should practice.

Malcolm wrote:
These are the things the aspirant can do. But they are not parsed as "vows." There is no language in the text to indicate that they are, or that they can be treated as individual aspects.

Personally, I am interested in a holistic view of the Buddha-Dharma, so I want to know how people in all traditions understand these things

Malcolm wrote:
Then stop calling the 48 parts of the aspiration of Dharmakāra "vows." They do not satisfy the requirement of a vow (samvara) from the pov of the Tibetan tradition.

If you continue to call these things vows, you won't understand pure land practice from the Tibetan Buddhist pov. You need to set aside your frame.

If Guo Gu had simply said, “I am a stream enterer” and you said you doubted it, I would understand and have nothing to say.

But you heard Guo Gu say his teacher, Sheng Yen, told him he was a stream enterer and this creates the following dilemma: either your doubt is that Guo Gu was lying (and I hope that isn’t the reason for your doubt) or that Sheng Yen, a renown Chan Master who knew Guo Gu since he was a child and was his teacher for many years, was mistaken and your doubt is about Sheng Yen’s discernment.

Yes, it will simply be Zen practitioners opinions about Zen teachers. To be honest, I’ve sat with a number of Zen teachers and not all Zen teachers are equal based on their personalities and tendencies, capabilities and skills, and depth of realization. Some, in my opinion (What else is there, except your opinions?) are awakened, and some not. Admittedly, even those I don’t believe are awakened are often excellent teachers.

My point, as I’ve stated repeatedly, is that it’s false modesty to not be honest about what Zen students believe about Zen teachers. Yes, it will be opinions, but our opinions about contemporary Zen teachers are no different than our opinions about the ancient Zen Masters and even the Buddha, except that we have their presence to aid our judgement.

Tulku Orgyen has said that all Yanas have some aspect of trekchod in their teachings. The term original purity is not unique to Dzogchen, it’s found in the PP sutras, etc.

So it is not surprising Meido would see some similarities between Dzogchen and Rinzai Zen in his later training.

But I don’t think one can just say Dzogchen and Zen are commensurate, there are important differences, not least of which is that Dzogchen is situated in a dialectic with the Path of Transformation in Vajrayana, whereas Chan/Zen/Son are situated in a dialectic with Sutric Buddhism, while largely accepting the path of renunciation advocated in Sutra as a basis for conduct, particularly in Chan and Son.

Similarities include, as noted above, teacher/student interaction that privileges oral instruction over scripture and rejection of path-based ranking schemes of realization.

A striking difference I perceive between Chan/Son/Zen is the extent to which Chan, etc., is deeply entwined with institutional practice, whereas Dzogchen practice is fundamentally a solo endeavor, carried out alone and in solitude. Of course I don’t mean to suggest there is no solo Chan/zen meditation practice, because of course there is. But group meditation practice, while not completely foreign to Dzogchen, especially in an instructional context, is not the general mode of practice. There are no Dzogchendos.

The gradations given by Vasubanlhu in AK are refined by Maitreya/Asanga dividing the Path into five stages.
In Abhisamaya-alamkara and in Abhisamaya-alamkara-aloka says that the lowest entry level into the path,
the first stage of practice, is called proximate liberation (moksa-bhagiya).
The equivalent term in AS is sambhara-marga.

The second stage - proximate penetration (nirvedha-bhagiya) is called prayoga-marga.
Its four divisions - usmagata, myrdhagata, ksanti and laukikagradharma are identical to those found in earlier Buddhism.
But Maytreya and Haribhadra frequently emphasize that stages of Mahayana penetration are superior (visistata)
to the Hinayana equivalents.


Darshanamarga is Abhisamaya, she is the first bhumi.
This is the answer to the question whether dhyana is necessary here.
Everyone answered correctly - "No".

Dhyana is necessary from the second bhumi, this is already the stage of bhavanamarga.
In conclusion, a list of the degrees of pollutions eliminated on the bhavanamarga, respectively bhumi:

Intellectual comprehension of Truths is possible without dhyanas.
In this case, it is the fruit of the stream-enterer.

There are 7 remaining shackles to be eradicated from the total 10 saṃyojanāni.

Five higher bonds and five lower ones. Three of them (sakkāya-diṭṭhi, vicikichā, sīlabbata-parāmāsa)
are eliminated by the Way of Seeing the Truths, i.e. Abhisamaya - full of intellectual comprehension.

Dhyana without understanding the Truths can eliminate all degrees (strong-medium-weak) of these seven impurities,
except inherent in bhavagra (8th dhyana).

Only one who has mastered the entrance to the 8th dhyana and fully comprehended the Truth is able to balance shamatha and vipashyana
in such a way as to achieve nirodha-samapatti.

Vasubandhu gives the example of the Buddha himself, who "reached the 8th dhyana even before he sat under the bodhi tree."
Bhavagra - the limit of the mundane Path, i.e. Dhyana without Truth.

Defilements were recognized that could only be removed by Truths and only dhyana.

The underdevelopment of one of these two paramitas means the presence of certain impurities.
Their perfection and balance make it possible to achieve nirodha-samapatti,
"calcinate" the most intractable samskaras, defilements still remaining on the bhavagra.

He concludes this section by saying that these qualities are not based solely on the “ripening force of individual beings” (sems-can rang-rang gi stobs smin-pa) but on the power of Amitābha's aspirations (smon-lam) and wisdom (ye-shes).

Malcolm wrote:
Right, without the ring of faith, there is nothing for the hook of compassion to catch. But this is beside the point. The point I keep making is that Pure Landers are inclined to focus on thus or that part of Amitabha”s aspiration. We aren’t.

As for accepting or rejecting sutras, if a sutra isn’t in the Tibetan Canon, we don’t read it, or reference it commentarially. You might regard this as short-sighted, but it isn’t. It’s just how our tradition evolved. Your’s evolved differently. That’s totally ok.

And he doesn’t really come right out and say “I attained this or that”, he couches it in terms of “I understood this personally” which later scholars take as confirmations of his realization.

The differences are just method, and that in Dzogchen one is introduced to nature of mind, in Zen one discovers it.

Malcolm wrote:
There are important differences. I would never, for example, assert expertise in Zen, claim to be able to explain koans, etc., or argue that shikantaza and trekcho are the same thing, though it is tempting to draw similarities. I would be suspicious of any Zen teacher who claimed they could explain Dzogchen unless they knew Tibetan, etc.

But as JD astutely observed, my initial response was one of discomfort with the responses reported by Dosho Port. It all seemed just a little pat to me. Slogans like "OMG, I am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together." Plus I really think that "nonduality" is an overused meme in Western "Eastern" spirituality, and when taken out of context is completely meaningless.

Malcolm wrote:
I don't have a problem with it per se, it just isn't how things are framed in a Tibetan Buddhist context. There is no commentarial analysis of these 48 points of Dharmakāra Bodhisattva's aspiration, for example. No distinctions are made between the 18th, 19th, and 20th point, no moḳsology connected with the kind of faith Zhen Li discusses——which isn't even one's own faith, properly speaking, but more of a pure trust in the efficacy of Dharmakāra's aspiration to do all the heavy lifting. This kind of idea is simply not present in the Tibetan Buddhist culture sphere.

The faith of simple people in Tibet is to recite the mani as much as possible, spinning prayer wheels all the while, and hope to be born in the Sukhavati after death, guided through the bardo there by a qualified lama. That's about it. When one does transference of consciousness, the form may be Amitabha, but the essence is one's guru. All phowas with three thoughts, a consciousness to transfer, a place to transfer, and the action are predicated on one transferring one's consciousness into the heart of one's guru visualized as Amitabha, Vajrasattva, etc. It is just an entirely different religious culture than Chinese or Japanese Pure Land Buddhism.

Thanks, Malcolm.

So then the point would be not to try to "match" two different rhetoric schemes (aka bhumis on one hand and Zen on the other), or am I misunderstanding you?

Malcolm wrote:
What I am saying is that at one level, it doesn't matter what this old master said or that one. What matters is gaining personal experience in the path. That can only happen if one actually make a commitment and actually practices the path. It is useless to sit around and compare realizations. We can only have our own realization and no one else's. No one can actually confirm our realization for us, in fact, not even the Buddha. That's why every teacher tells their students, "Great, you understood something, keep up the good work" if the student is sincere. Acknowledgement of a student by a teacher is far more about the student's sincerity than confirming that someone has achieved this or that rank.

For example, in Dzogchen teachings, there is only one level, rhetorically speaking. Where other teachings such as Vajrayāna, Lotus Buddhism, Shingon, etc., are ekayāna teachings, Dzogchen is an ekabhumi teaching. Zen is a little similar, according to my understanding. In Dzogchen, you learn to recognize your own state after it has been introduced; you work on removing doubt about that state; and then, when you have resolved your doubts, you continue in that state. But these are just words. The rubber has got to meet the road, otherwise it is all just rhetorical posturing.

Just to be clear (I ask because I truly do not know, I'm not really interested in polemics), what Malcolm and Johnny are saying is that the language used in the Zen tradition re Buddhahood (see for instance Astus's messages in this thread) is rhetorical, and that the awakening spoken of in Zen does not correspond with awakening as understood in the general Mahayana tradition. Is this correct?

Astus said:
There is such an interpretation, especially when one takes the side of Doctrine (jiao 教 - a Zen term for the rest of Buddhism that's based on scriptures and treatises). On the other hand, it can also be said that it's the 'general Mahayana' that is rhetorical, while Zen is seeing how things are. And there's also a third option, that it's all a matter of skilful means and one works with whatever one can work for the single goal of liberation.

I think that’s a legitimate approach within a tradition. There are plenty of Pure Land sutras that Honen and others could have used to support their approach, but either they didn’t know about them or they weren’t available. What we today consider the “canon” isn’t necessarily what historic monastic would call the Tripitaka or Twelve Section canon. Halkias makes this point too with reference to different monastic libraries in Tibet, which don’t perfectly have collections that all correspond to Derge equivalents.

As for the matter of particular vows, Halkias makes the interesting point that the four requisites are in fact directly lifted from the nineteenth vow, so Tibetan Pure Land methodology is explicitly a nineteenth vow approach in contrast to East Asian methodologies. Just something interesting that came out of my reading so far.

This is pretty interesting in as far as deconstructions of the vows were used to develop these methodologies. If you deconstruct the nineteenth vow you get the four requisites, and if you deconstruct the eighteenth vow you get the threefold mind. The twentieth vow on the other hand supports more the kind of continual Nembutsu practices you see in mainland schools and Tendai.

Among Tibetan commentaries, there is no such deconstruction of the parts of the aspiration. It is one aspiration with 48 parts. If any of the 48 parts are not satisfied, the other 47 are voided.

Then the commentaries contradict the sutras since the Larger sutra itself states that the lowest grade consists of those who have only recited the name and nothing else. Why should commentaries be taken more seriously than what the actual sutra states?

Malcolm wrote:
The measure of progress in Dharma: are your three poisons under control? Are you a more loving and compassionate person?  Are you more patient, relaxed, and easy going? Are you wiser when viewing cause and effect? Do you have some understanding of emptiness and dependent origination? If the answer is yes to all of these questions, then you are doing pretty good job as a practitioner. In this case it does matter whether you practice Zen, Vipassana, Dzogchen, Pure Land, Nichiren Buddhism, Vajrayāna, and so on.

The awakening or enlightenment of other people is not transferrable. All teachers can do us is show us a path. As long as they understand the path they are practicing, have some core competencies in the literature of their tradition, as well as some kind of lineage transmission, then they can teach to interested people. If they happen to be awakened, great. But there is no special sign that someone is an ārya bodhisattva, they don't carry signs. One can only know a bodhisattva through their extraordinary compassion.

In the lower stages, bodhisattvas don't remember their training in past lives and will not possess the realization they had in previous lives. They practice the path and realize it again. This is why the lower bodhisattva stages are stages of retrogression. When one passes away, even if one reached the sixth bodhisattva stage, one will forget it in the next life until one meets the dharma again, whenever that is, in a future life. To be a Mahāyāna bodhisattva requires great courage and the commitment to practice the path to the end. There are many time where we will take rebirth where there will be no dharma for us to meet, no teachers to meet, no sangha to have.

If Buddhism depended on enlightened teachers these days, it would have already been extinguished.

The very first Buddhist teacher I ever encountered was on a weekend field trip to go sit with Eido Shimano in 1978 at Dai Bosatsu Zendo. I was sixteen, and I thought for sure that this guy must be enlightened. When I heard about the drunken sprawl that constituted a weekend field trip sit with Trungpa at Tail of Tiger, I was pretty smug, since I was very impressed with Dai Bosatsu (I was't permitted to go because I was delinquent in my homework).

At Dai Bosatsu, I remember chanting the Heart Sutra in Japanese, but of course I could not keep up. And I remember being hit with a stick, which at that place you had to request. I wanted to see what it felt like.  Of course I never received a Koan, etc., because I never went back there. But I always felt a kinship with the Japanese Zen tradition in general. When I went to Japan, a monk from Koyasan who spoke English asked me what kind of Buddhist I was, since I self-identified as a Buddhist, and I told him I was a Rinzai Buddhist. Of course, I did not know what I was talking about, but because I had that weekend experience at a nominally Rinzai place, that's what I said. (A funny aside, some of the kids brought valium to make it through the sitting periods, but I toughed it out).

Imagine my disappointment when, thirty-two years later, I heard he had been a serial womanizer, and that Robert Aitken had been keeping a record of his indiscretions for decades. The scandal went so deep that Myōshin-ji rejected the qualifications of all people that Shimano had designated as successors.

Now, many of the major Zen Buddhist founding teachers and their students in the US of note have been implicated in some kind of impropriety with women, financial impropriety, etc. some even claiming their bodhisattva activity justified their behavior. We all know who they are, no need to rehash the details . Many major Tibetan Buddhists like Trungpa, etc., were all deeply involved sex scandals, drug addiction, alcoholism, etc. Not just in the Kagyu school, but in Nyingma, Gelug, and so on. Even here we run into people who assert Trungpa was enlightened because x or y said so. I don't believe it.

I generally do not believe students of teachers when they assure me their guru or roshi or sensei or geshe or tulku is a highly realized being. I certainly don't believe it when a guru or roshi or sensei or geshe or tulku declares they are a highly realized being.

If someone passes, and they shows signs and relics at the time of their death, maybe I will believe it. But also signs and relics can just be the play of the four elements, and illustrate nothing special at all, so maybe I won't. Also nonbuddhist yogis sometimes sit for days without their bodies showing signs of decay, which demonstrates nothing more than function of mundane samādhis and nothing about awakening, bodhi.

All I know is that studying and practicing Dharma has brought meaning and purpose to my life. But claims of realization by Buddhist teachers and for Buddhist teachers? Meh. You can keep 'em. I am not buying.

It's the difference between practising without calculation and attaining Buddhahood upon death, and wavering and spending 500 years or many kalpas to even begin hearing the Dharma again. This is an interpretation not treated in TB, so we don't have to continue this discussion here, but I personally find it interesting to explore potential overlaps and parallels. The different kinds of Phowa, for instance, are something worth exploring in this regard.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes. In Tibetan Buddhism, the practice is designed on the basis of the first grade of practitioners. So if some one is serious about being in the best or second best kind of birth, they know what to do.

Apart from  irmanakaya phowa, the other two do do not involve birth in Sukhavati.
In particular lamas train in nirmanakaya phowa mainly to help others. Also when train, you need to have the sign of phowa to assist others, and as proof you yourself will succeed if you can do it at the time death.

I agree that Bhadracari would be sufficient for birth, but would identify it as birth through the 19th and 20th vows.

Malcolm wrote:
In our tradition, Dharmakāra only makes one aspiration. It may have forty-eight parts, but they are integral to a single aspiration. One can argue over which passage is more important, but actually, it's just one aspiration.

Zhen Li said:
This is the same in Jōdo Shinshū, the term 本願 (pūrva-praṇidhāna) has multiple referents:
1. The 48 vows.
2. The Gates for Birth (Essential Gate (19th), Provisional (20th), and Ocean Like (18th))
3. The Ocean Like Vow or True Gate (18th)

These distinctions were originally made by Shandao.

Hōnen added the dimension of "selection." This means that each of the 48 vows was specifically selected for a reason and to provide the Pure Land with a particular quality. It's not just a shotgun blast with a scattering of qualities here and there—they are actually selected for particular purposes. Hōnen also points out that we can select among the gate for birth, and indicates that the essential intent of the Larger, Shorter, and Contemplation sūtras is that the 18th vow is the universal vow that permits the full working of Amitābha's other power.

Shinran only added the clarification that the 19th vow is specifically meditative and non-meditative good acts, and that birth occurs by transferring the merits of those practices to birth, and that the 20th vow is Amitābha-oriented practice, but reliant upon self-power, hence it contains both "true and provisional aspects," i.e. both self and other power components. So, with Phowa, we can say that it is enabled by the 20th vow because it depends upon the practitioner's meditative act to activate, but it is enabled by Amitābha making the vow that enables birth through such methods in the first place.
Malcolm wrote:
Sure, one might argue that the 18th part is the most important because of the gatha that says:

If any sentient being hears my name,
they will be born in my buddhafield.

But this is nothing I have ever seen any Tibetan scholar advance as a special position, Mipham included.

It also depends on the audience. 98% of the pūrva-praṇidhāna is skilful means.

If you can manage to get your act together. Sukhavati phowa is enormously unreliable in this regard.  Case in point: there was a famous phowa master in Dedham Dun, who successfully performed phowa often for other people. However, when it came time for this master to perform phowa for himself, he was unable to do so.  He died before His Holiness Sakya Trichen was able to perform it for him.

There are many forms of phowa. Some involve Sukhavati, but not all. Sukhavati phowas are considered nirmanakaya phowas, because they involve a subject, an object, and an action. There are also sambhogakaya phowas and dharmakaya phowas. These later two have nothing to do with birth in Sukhavati, and instead refer to attaining buddhahood in bardo or at the time of death. Phowa is a rich tradition, which encompasses many approaches.

The only difference between the samādhi of watching TV and the training of samādhi in the Dharma is that the former is contaminated, and the latter is not. But the samādhi, the mental factor, is identical in both cases, only the object is different. What makes the samādhi part hard is that it is difficult to shift one's focus from mundane contaminated objects to mundane uncontaminated objects, such as the path dharmas. Hence, the need for śila as a basis for samādhi. But this has nothing actually to do with samādhi itself. Samādhi can be focused wherever one likes. And in the case of a practitioners, that concentration is focused on Dharma. It also has nothing developing rarified samadhis, etc. Samādhi here just means being able to focus the mind at will. Thats it. People keep turning these things into strange beasts. We avoid things that disturb our minds (śila), so that we can focus (samādhi) on developing the three wisdoms. That's it. It's not complicated.

Its better to understand the essence of a thing, rather than pile elaboration on top of elaboration.

Bodhi, waking up, means realizing emptiness, not intellectually, but in actuality. It's inexpressible, so how can it be expressed in words?

This is why, when I see such articles like these in Trike, etc., it makes me skeptical. I don't doubt that Dosho Port is writing this in good faith. I am just skeptical.

Have these people even achieved patience towards their own afflictions? Are they still gripped by the three poisons? If they are, then they have not realized emptiness at all, but merely had an training experience that approximates emptiness. It's a good experience, a positive working basis for bodhi, but it isn't awakening, bodhi. It's like someone who opens their eyes for moment before waking up in the morning and then falls back into the early morning dream they were having.  YMMV.

I doubt my skepticism damages his reputation. There are all kinds of claims of realization for this and that teacher and by this and that teacher. I am generally skeptical of them all.

In my book, one can claim one has some realization without being a first stage bodhisattva. But claiming one has directly realized emptiness is a big claim. To claim one is a first stage bodhisattva is to put on some big pants. A well know but somewhat controversial student of Maezumi Roshi once told me he thought he was a first stage bodhisattva, when I asked him for an explanation of Tozan's five ranks. I didn't believe him either.

“If he wishes to, he can apply himself in such a way that in just one instant, in one moment, he can give up his entire family, wife, and possessions and be ordained in the Tathāgata’s teaching. Having been ordained, in just one instant he will attain and rest in a hundred samādhis, see a hundred buddhas and know their blessings, cause a hundred worlds to shake, go to a hundred buddha realms, [F.185.b] illuminate a hundred worlds, ripen a hundred beings, remain for a hundred eons, enter a hundred previous eons and a hundred future eons, open a hundred Dharma doors, manifest a hundred bodies, and manifest each body having a retinue of a hundred bodhisattvas.

Even then, it’s not guaranteed, even from the point of view of the tradition of Karma Chakme. A commentary by Tujey Zhanphen Pel on Karma Chakme’s famous aspiration specifies four requirements for birth in Sukhavati: the support, the recollection of the merit field at the time of death; the cause, gathering of accumulations and the purification of obscurations; the assistant, the generation of bodhicitta; and the condition, the pure aspiration.

The point is that if, at the time of death, one cannot maintain this recollection of Amitabha and his host, even if one spent a lifetime aspiring to birth in Sukhavati, one will not succeed in the end. From this perspective, mere faith is not a sufficient cause, in our tradition.

Zhen Li said:
Mere faith isn't sufficient for birth in the highest grade and highest rank in Jōdo Shinshū either. That's why Shinjin isn't one's own citta, it's the citta of Amida. Assurance is something that comes from the Buddha. However, the Pure Land sūtras permit birth by very slight causes. Birth in the lowest grade and lowest rank is rendered possible by one's own power, thinking of Amida even only ten times, including by those who committed the five grave offences.

I am personally familiar with first dhyāna being an absolutely mandatory necessity, but I'm open to other perspectives.

Malcolm wrote:
Samadhi is a natural mental factor of one pointedness. People with no experience, who like to follow books like recipe guides, say such things as "first dhyāna is absolutely mandatory for the path of seeing." But then you have to ask them if they have discovered the path of seeing. If they say no, then obviously they are just going to the basis of what they have heard or read in a book. If they say yes, there are other tests you can apply.

In Mahāyāna, the samadhi part is not perfected until the fifth bhumi. There is no requirement for the first dhyāna to realize the first bhumi. The first bhumi merely requires realization of śunyatā. That can come about as a result of the union of śamatha and vipaśyāna, or it can be arrived at merely through vipaśyāna. It depends on the person. All that is really necessary is that aspiring bodhisattva can focus on their analysis on the emptiness of objects without being distracted, but is certainly does not mean that they have to first perfect all four or five factors of the first dhyāna. It won't harm them if they do, but it is not required.

You should examine Discerning the Middle from the Extremes, it presents a concise summary of the five paths and how they are realized in Mahāyāna. Madhyamaka texts do not discuss this so much, at least, not early ones.

In this decision, given in the case of Tsurphu Labrang vs. Karmapa Charitable Trust and Ors., announced in New Delhi on July 5, 2004, the court refused to hear the appeal of the Tsurphu Labrang, a group created by Gyaltsab Rinpoche and Tenzin Namgyal to represent the claims of followers of Ogyen Trinley to manage Rumtek in legal proceedings. The court rejected their Special Leave Petition to this effect. By thus refusing to interfere in the earlier decision of the Sikkim District Court and a subsequent confirmation by the High Court in New Delhi, the Supreme Court allowed the original decision to stand -- meaning that the Tsurphu group had no legal claim to Rumtek, and that the Karmapa Charitable Trust was the only group recognized to manage the monastery.

Despite the popularity of Zen in Kamakura and Hōjō Tokiyori‘s support for it, Zen in Kamakura itself was still small potatoes, and confined to the literate elite. It was the “it” Buddhism of the day, since it was the latest Import from China. When Tokiyori ordained in 1256, Nichiren would had been 34. And had himself barely arrived in Kamakura.  It would be six years more before Nichiren forwarded his Risshō Ankoku Ron to Tokiyori, who had by then ordained and left the government in the hands of Hōjō Nagatoki. The person most instrumental in spreading Zen in the Kamakura era was Hōjō Tokimune. It was he who banished Nichiren to Sado Island. Tokimune’s teacher was the Chinese monk, Mugaku Sogen. However, Mugaku did not arrive until 1279.

Malcolm wrote:
The reason why your argument here is flawed is that there is a clear distinction to be made between natural gotra and “expanded gotra.” For example, all viable seeds have the potential to germinate (natural gotra), but without water, warmth, and soil, they won’t germinate (expanded gotra). It is just not inevitable that all sentient beings will develop the aspiration to attain buddhahood for the welfare of all sentient beings. As the old saying goes, one can lead a horse to water, but one can’t force it to drink. All sentient beings may be “buddhanatured”, but not all sentient will necessarily generate Mahayana  bodhicitta. Without bodhicitta, buddhahood is just not possible. This also why Madhyamikas like Candrakirti entertain the probability that there are some benighted sentient beings who will never attain buddhahood, despite having the potential to attain buddhahood, just as some seeds never germinate, even though they are viable.

The pratisaṃdhivijñāna, specifically in the case of the modern Theravāda sect (which rejects the "in-between" state between births), is compared to lighting an unlit candle with a lit candle. If there is no unlit candle to inherit the flame, then the flame goes out and dies (i.e. it becomes "extinguished"/nirvṛti). I believe that this is what Schrödinger’s Yidam was referring to.

Astus said:
It might be so, although it could as well be what's taught in the https://suttacentral.net/mn72/en/sujato as an illustration of the Buddha not being identifiable as anything already in his life, hence the baseless conjecture about birth after death:

“Suppose that fire burning in front of you was extinguished. Would you know: ‘This fire in front of me is extinguished’?”
“Yes, I would, Master Gotama.”
“But Vaccha, suppose they were to ask you: ‘This fire in front of you that is extinguished: in what direction did it go—east, south, west, or north?’ How would you answer?”
“It doesn’t apply, Master Gotama. The fire depended on grass and logs as fuel. When that runs out, and no more fuel is added, the fire is reckoned to have become extinguished due to lack of fuel.”
“In the same way, Vaccha, any form by which a Realized One might be described has been cut off at the root, made like a palm stump, obliterated, and unable to arise in the future. A Realized One is freed from reckoning in terms of form. They’re deep, immeasurable, and hard to fathom, like the ocean. ‘They’re reborn’, ‘they’re not reborn’, ‘they’re both reborn and not reborn’, ‘they’re neither reborn nor not reborn’—none of these apply.”

Anyway, it is pretty clear that the Zen that got Nichiren's back up was the Daruma school, but that had already been banned by 1194 becasue Eisai, recently returned from studying Chan in China, requested the Tendau school to shut Nonin down.

Both Eisai and Dogen met with a lot of resistance from the Tendai school over their versions of Zen, with Dogen eventually fleeing Kyoto politics to the mountains outside present day Fukui City in western Japan in 1243, where he built Eiheiji.

The Pure Land school was much more immediately popular than Zen during the 13th century. The hegemony of Zen in Japanese Buddhism took considerable time to develop.

This is also an interesting topic and maybe it's worth a separate thread. But I have been taught a few times that we can take Master Shinran or Rennyō as our teacher. There's actually not the specification that the teacher needs to be alive or present before us. Hōnen, for instance, relied on Shandao's writings to gain Shinjin but did not himself meet Shandao.

Rennyō said, for instance, that if someone lacks faith, let them listen to the scriptures of our tradition (i.e. KGSS) repeatedly, up to a hundred times. If they don't have Shinjin after that, then they lack the karmic roots.

This is definitely a difference between common Mahayana on the one hand, and Vajrayana as well as Zen on the other. Dogen, for example, makes it absolutely clear that real Zen lies in the interaction between teacher and student.

There are multiple layers of development in the sūtra, as I demonstrate in the introduction.

When someone’s argument depends on a citation which does not correspond to their premise, the entire argument can be regarded as a failure.

You might think your argument hangs together on the basis of what you’ve judged an accurate rendering of the Chinese, but since the Tibetan translation, likely rendered in reference to the Chinese translation, is at such a stark variance, I can’t accept your argument on the face of such a stark contrast. You will note I did not assert your rendering entirely wrong, merely that I consider this passage invalid based on a version I consider more authoritative.

Malcolm, I had posted in the previous page what a sravaka might say about all of this. I wonder if there are historical arguments from Mahayana/TB on this:

(about arhat not being actually final enlightenment/nirvana, only leading to formless realm, and reborn to do the Bodhisattva path...)
I think the sravakas would ask "If that's all true, why would the historical Buddha Shakyamuni not teach the actual path? Yeah yeah okay, 500 years before Nagarjuna, people are not as sharp in mental faculties, but why bother teaching the sravaka path at all considering it sounds a lot like the Jain vehicle? So either that's the case, or maybe your team's calculations is off a bit and that the Buddha Shakyamuni was actually right and sravaka is the path he taught in the buddhavacana."

I think tho that that needs to be clarified to beginners. The "mind" of such dharmakaya is not material or has essence? (or is that wrong) Rather, the dharmakaya is emptiness itself, so there cannot be a "mind" that is "something". (Please correct, if this statement is in error)

So going back to Caoimhghín's post, the Buddha does not have a "mind", in the dharmakaya sense. (emptiness) And in the material/nirmanakaya sense.

So when Malcolm says the mind of the nirmanayaka is the dharmakaya, I feel like, yes that's true. But that mind in not "something" or a substance/material.

Plz correct if this is wrong. My reading of Madhyamaka and other materials is introductory level.

Thank you, but the Larger Sutra states:

(3. The lower grade)

[25] The Buddha said to Ananda, "The lower grade of aspirants are the devas and humans in the worlds of the ten quarters who sincerely desire to be born in that land. Although unable to do many meritorious deeds, they awaken aspiration for the highest Enlightenment and single-mindedly concentrate on Amitayus even ten times, desiring birth in his land. When they hear the profound Dharma, they joyfully accept it and do not entertain any doubt; and so, remembering the Buddha even once, they sincerely aspire to be born in that land. When they are about to die, they will see the Buddha in a dream. Those aspirants, too, will be born in the Pure Land. Their merit and wisdom will be next to those of the middle grade of aspirants."
http://web.mit.edu/stclair/www/larger.html#Three%20grades%20of%20aspirants

Nowhere does it mention the four requirements here.


Malcolm wrote:
What I quoted from is the so-called Large Sūtra, it is the passage immediately before this one above. The Sanskrit and Tibetan text certainly mentions these four requirementsfor those who see Amitabha before them in person. For whatever reason, in the Tibetan tradition, seeing Amitabha in a dream is not sufficient for immediate birth, only those of the first and second grade will do so.

Because the second grade also generate (1) bodhicitta, (2) the altruistic thought to attain birth there, (3) much merit, and (4) direct their minds to Sukhavati, when they approach death, an emanation of Amitabha and his retinue appear to that person and as soon as they die, they will take birth in Sukhavati.

No such stated guarantee is made for people who merely see Amitabha in dream. In its Sanskrit and Tibetan version there is no statement in the Long Sūtra that as soon as those person's die they will be born in Sukhavati. It merely says they will be born there without specifying a time frame.

Thus, there is a difference in the textual tradition which underlies a difference in understanding the requirements for birth in Sukhavati. Thus, as I said, it is not so easy to take birth in Sukhavati from the Tibetan tradition's point of view. For this reason there is a sadhana practice of Amitabha with the mantra.

Generally, in the Tibetan tradition, we focus on the longevity-providing aspect of Amitabha, Amitayuḥ.

Does that mean then that they are reborn (inspite of what they expected: arhats = end of rebirth) reborn as regular sentient beings to become Bodhissatva?

Malcolm wrote:
This is a difficult point. Some scholars assert that, once roused from the absorption of cessation (nirodhasamāpatti), arhats are basically equivalent to 7th stage bodhisattvas and some even assert they can enter the bodhisattva path on the eighth bodhisattva stage because it is asserted that arhats are equivalent to bodhisattvas in realizing the selflessness of phenomena that is the absence of inherent existence.

Other scholars assert that once roused from the absorption of cessation (nirodhasamāpatti) arhats must begin at the beginning of the Mahāyāna path of accumulation since they have not generated Mahāyāna bodhicitta nor have they realized the profound emptiness free from extremes. I personally favor the latter position because the Abhisamayālaṃkāra clearly describes the superiority of the hearing and reflection on signlessness in the Mahāyāna path of accumulation, and so on. Gorampa summarizes it as follows in his Moonrays:

Nalanda said:
Therefore, in our own system of Madhyamaka, although the selflessness of the three yānas is equivalent, the difference between whether freedom from proliferation, the two accumulations, the ultimate nature and reality are realized or not realized is clear in all Madhyamaka textual systems.

Malcolm wrote:
Basically, arhats have a subtle grasping to true existence because they do not realize four-fold signlessness. Since they have this subtle grasping to true existence, they continue to grasp a self. Because they continue to grasp a self, they accumulate action. And since they continue to accumulation action, they can continue to take birth, having been roused from nirodhasamāpatti. And because of this arhats, in order to realize buddhahood, must begin at the beginning of the Mahāyāna path of application where one reviews through hearing and reflection signlessness, etc.

To be fair, they say that the doctrine of the rousing is provisional.

I believe in the rousing myself, it's in the Lotus Sūtra and the Prajñā Treatise, but there are plenty that don't. Furthermore, we are talking about Buddhahood in two different ways with regards to two different things. I am familiar with imperfect degrees of Buddha, including "(Ārya)Bodhisattva" and "Pratyekabuddha."


Malcolm wrote:
Who are "they?" Some modern academicians?

There are all kinds of grades of bodhi, that is not at issue here. We can certainly consider tenth stage bodhisattvas a type of buddha, since the Abhisamayālaṃkāra deems it so, since their omniscience is very nearly that of a samyasaṃbuddha. But to claim that arhats and pratyekabuddhas cannot be roused from their samadhi a) defies scripture b) defies logic. In the first place, we have already agreed that there is scriptural evidence that arhats, etc. are roused. In the second place, asserting they cannot be roused means they are essentially icchantikas, that their continuums have ceased to exist, and so on. Moreover, such as assertion harms the bodhisattva path, because the consequence of this assertion is that no one can attain samyaksambuddhahood, not even the buddha, since as soon as their afflictions are completely eradicated, a bodhisattva can no longer proceed on the bodhisattva path. So I stand by my initial claim. There is no such thing as a śrāvakabuddha. They may not like the idea since an arhat, once roused from cessation, has to begin at the Mahāyāna path of accumulation, rendering them effectively ordinary sentient beings.

And it goes without saying, Buddhas cannot liberate anyone. The proof of this is that there are still sentient beings. No Buddha with the capacity to liberate sentient beings would ever leave so many in samsara. One can only liberate oneself from this samsara. No Buddha or bodhisattva can do it for you.

How does he replace negative lustful emotions and/or romantic emotions towards his attractive younger female platonic friend with bodhicitta / loving-kindness / compassion?

Malcolm wrote:
He should cultivate the thought this women is his daughter or his younger sister.

2) A middle-aged man has a very aggressive hot-tempered younger brother who has been attacking the middle-aged man with verbal abuse and vulgarities and even threatening the middle-aged man with physical violence and challenges to physical fights.

How does he replace negative angry emotions towards his younger aggressive hot-tempered bully brother with bodhicitta / loving-kindness / compassion?

Malcolm wrote:
He should understand this younger man is not in his right mind. And if necessary, place distance between himself and the aggressor.

As for TB, people practice all their lives to accumulate merit and realisations, and yet, at the end of the day, they rely on Amitābha to gain birth and attain actual buddhahood.

Malcolm wrote:
Even then, it’s not guaranteed, even from the point of view of the tradition of Karma Chakme. A commentary by Tujey Zhanphen Pel on Karma Chakme’s famous aspiration specifies four requirements for birth in Sukhavati: the support, the recollection of the merit field at the time of death; the cause, gathering of accumulations and the purification of obscurations; the assistant, the generation of bodhicitta; and the condition, the pure aspiration.

The point is that if, at the time of death, one cannot maintain this recollection of Amitabha and his host, even if one spent a lifetime aspiring to birth in Sukhavati, one will not succeed in the end. From this perspective, mere faith is not a sufficient cause, in our tradition.

This is not a problem. This requires that arhats be roused in ordered to be introduced to Mahāyāna aspiration. It is not a passage claiming arhats cannot be roused by a buddha. The reason it is possible for an arhat to realize perfect buddha eventually is given a little later:

I believe in the rousing myself, it's in the Lotus Sūtra and the Prajñā Treatise, but there are plenty that don't. Furthermore, we are talking about Buddhahood in two different ways with regards to two different things. I am familiar with imperfect degrees of Buddha, including "(Ārya)Bodhisattva" and "Pratyekabuddha."


Malcolm wrote:
Who are "they?" Some modern academicians?

There are all kinds of grades of bodhi, that is not at issue here. We can certainly consider tenth stage bodhisattvas a type of buddha, since the Abhisamayālaṃkāra deems it so, since their omniscience is very nearly that of a samyasaṃbuddha. But to claim that arhats and pratyekabuddhas cannot be roused from their samadhi a) defies scripture b) defies logic. In the first place, we have already agreed that there is scriptural evidence that arhats, etc. are roused. In the second place, asserting they cannot be roused means they are essentially icchantikas, that their continuums have ceased to exist, and so on. Moreover, such as assertion harms the bodhisattva path, because the consequence of this assertion is that no one can attain samyaksambuddhahood, not even the buddha, since as soon as their afflictions are completely eradicated, a bodhisattva can no longer proceed on the bodhisattva path. So I stand by my initial claim. There is no such thing as a śrāvakabuddha. They may not like the idea since an arhat, once roused from cessation, has to begin at the Mahāyāna path of accumulation, rendering them effectively ordinary sentient beings.

India, Mañjuśrī's pure land, Wutai Shan, in China, Medicine Buddha's pure land (which you can take birth in if you recite the dhāraṇi of Medicine Buddha seven times every day), etc. All of these pure lands are "generated nirmāṇakāya" pure lands, which arose out of the aspiration of this or that bodhisattva to purify a buddhafield, one of the important deeds of a bodhisattva on the stages.

There are also natural nirmāṇakāya buddhafields, which are buddhafields emanated by the five sambhogkāya buddha families. Birth in these is guaranteed for the average practitioner of Dzogchen teachings, people who have received Dzogchen teachings but are unable to practice them well in this life.

The special feature of these nirmāṇakāya buddhafields is that the door to the three realms is permanently closed, and perfect, full buddhahood is attained within five hundred human years, without taking another birth in samsara, rather than the interminably long, albeit blissful and edifying, time one spends in other pure lands. It should also be mentioned that middling practitioners of Dzogchen attain perfect, full buddhahood in the bardo. The best practitioners attain perfect, full buddhahood either in this life or at the moment of death.

German Buddhist monk and university professor Bhikkhu Analayo had not given much attention to the topic of rebirth before some friends asked him to explore the treatment of the issue in early Buddhist texts. This succinct volume presents his findings, approaching the topic from four directions. The first chapter examines the doctrine of rebirth as it is presented in the earliest Buddhist sources and the way it relates to core doctrinal principles. The second chapter reviews debates about rebirth throughout Buddhist history and up to modern times, noting the role of confirmation bias in evaluation of evidence. Chapter 3 reviews the merits of current research on rebirth, including near-death experience, past-life regression, and children who recall previous lives. The chapter concludes with an examination of xenoglossy, the ability to speak languages one has not learned previously, and chapter 4 examines the particular case of Dhammaruwan, a Sri Lankan boy who chants Pali texts that he does not appear to have learned in his present life. Rebirth in Early Buddhism and Current Research brings together the many strands of the debate on rebirth in one place, making it both comprehensive and compact. It is not a polemic but an interrogation of the evidence, and it leaves readers to come to their own conclusions.

They amount to a “Sure, buddy, you can do it!” In contrast to the sourpuss shravakayana assertions that one has to receive a prediction in person from a buddha, while being male and so on.

No, there is scriptural support for the idea all _can_ become Buddhas. Even the Lotus only asserts a prediction. Such assertions are interpretable, like the teachings on buddhanature itself. Thus is not a guarantee that all will become Buddhas. This is why Indian Madhyamakas, no slouches when it comes to reading and interpreting sutras, deny the existence of icchantikas while allowing that there are some beings so benighted that they will never attain buddhahood.

They amount to a “Sure, buddy, you can do it!” In contrast to the sourpuss shravakayana assertions that one has to receive a prediction in person from a buddha, while being male and so on.

And, if all sentient beings are actually going to become Buddhas, thus undermines the reason for having bodhicitta in the first place. There are a number of negative consequences for taking such a position literally.

I am wondering about Mahayana/Vajrayana Teachers, Schools or Sutras which talk about the inevitable "salvation" of all from Samsara?

Malcolm wrote:
You have to distinguish between two types of gotra, or inclination for awakening: natural and activated.

Only those sentient beings who have activated their inclination for awakening will attain buddhahood. There is no guarantee that all sentient beings will awaken to full buddhahood, since there is no guarantee that all sentient beings will eventually take birth as human beings with eight freedoms and ten endowments and meet the Dharma. And meeting the Dharma is the condition for attaining Buddhahood. And, the Buddha did say:

Misdeeds cannot be washed away with water.
Suffering cannot be removed by hand.
I cannot give liberation to you, 
but I can demonstrate the path.

Meeting the path of the Dharma always requires some cause, some gathering of merit. No one can meet the Dharma and practice the path without first attaining the precious human birth. Various examples are taught by the Buddha to illustrate the rarity of the fully qualified human birth, one of the most famous of which is that a precious human birth is as rare as a blind sea turtle who rises to the surface of the ocean every one hundred years, and just happens to put his head through a golden yoke that has been floating on the surface of the ocean.

So, no, there is no valid Mahāyāna tradition that teaches it is inevitable that all sentient beings will attain buddhahood. It is a realistic probability that some sentient beings, despite having the potential to attain buddhahood, will never gather the causes and conditions for meeting the Dharma, much less even be reborn as a human being who can attain buddhahood.

...Chalmers argues that we could already be inhabitants of a virtual reality: “We can never prove we’re not in a computer simulation because any evidence of ordinary reality could be simulated.”

This is known as the simulation hypothesis, the scenario that is explored in the recently released Matrix Resurrections. Chalmers points out that humans have already invented games that simulate real life, such as The Sims. These will become more sophisticated over time, with versions of them running on millions of devices. Furthermore, out there in the rest of the universe, “if any aliens have human-level intelligence, they should eventually develop computers and program them. If these alien civilisations survive long enough, they’ll likely create simulated universes.” Statistically speaking, that means simulated beings probably already vastly outnumber “real” ones. In other words, it’s more likely we’re living in a simulation than in the original version of our world. ...

Ultimately, Reality+ is about extending our sense of the real. Chalmers’s central idea, that “there is more to reality than we thought”, is seductive, and I was surprised to find his arguments delightfully – or perhaps worryingly – convincing.

He has taken a subject most people would dismiss as pure science fiction and produced a brilliant and very readable philosophical investigation.
This is the David Chalmers who defined the 'hard problem' of consciousness so we should take him (at least a little ) seriously. His new book Reality+ is reviewed here - https://www.theguardian.com/books/2022/jan/19/reality-by-david-j-chalmers-review-are-we-living-in-a-simulation.

Making a connection with a guru is serious business and many so-called teachers presenting themselves as as so-called gurus have concocted or exaggerated credentials. Nor do they have any idea how to care for their students. Being a teacher is a serious responsibility, as is being a student.

So one has to be discerning in the beginning. You have to be like a bee, and see which teachers and lineages resonate, and then investigate them, and see what faults and qualities they have. What you do not need is an old fraud like me.

Can you imagine, "the female deities of washing water...." Thanks, I'll keep "goddesses."

Anyway, goddess is a fine English word, as is god:

goddess (n.)
mid-14c., female deity in a polytheistic religion, from god + fem. suffix -esse (see -ess). The Old English word was gyden, corresponding to Dutch godin, German Göttin, Danish gudine, Swedish gudinna. Of mortal women by 1570s. Related: Goddesshood.

god (n.)
Origin and meaning of god
also God; Old English god "supreme being, deity; the Christian God; image of a god; godlike person," from Proto-Germanic *guthan (source also of Old Saxon, Old Frisian, Dutch god, Old High German got, German Gott, Old Norse guð, Gothic guþ), which is of uncertain origin; perhaps from PIE *ghut- "that which is invoked" (source also of Old Church Slavonic zovo "to call," Sanskrit huta- "invoked," an epithet of Indra), from root *gheu(e)- "to call, invoke." The notion could be "divine entity summoned to a sacrifice. "

But some trace it to PIE *ghu-to- "poured," from root *gheu- "to pour, pour a libation" (source of Greek khein "to pour," also in the phrase khute gaia "poured earth," referring to a burial mound; see found (v.2)). "Given the Greek facts, the Germanic form may have referred in the first instance to the spirit immanent in a burial mound" [Watkins]. See also Zeus. In either case, not related to good.

It is very faulty. Buddha's awakening was predicted on seeing dependent origination. Whatever is empty is dependently originated, whatever is dependent originated is empty. Negations are merely an analytical manner of approximating emptiness. Negations are not themselves the insight into the absence of inherent existence of dependently originated phenomena. When an ārya cognizes emptiness, they are cognizing the emptiness of something, and that something is always something which arises dependent on causes and conditions.

So, basically Avi Sion is an idiot who did not bother to even understand the thought of the person he was refuting.

cyril said:
Ok, understood. But when we say all dependently originated phenomena are empty of inherent existence, we do not negate that which arises as dependently originated; that's only the basis for our negation. What we negate is the inherent existence; but, since that is a concept, it follows that the non-conceptual mind could not cognize it as such. It looks like there is something i fail to grasp here.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, inherent existence, an existence that is nondependent, is a false concept that we negate in relation to mere existence, an existence that arises dependent on causes and conditions. When we search for inherent existence, we cannot find it. That nonfinding is called "emptiness." For example, we can say a pot is empty of water, without implying there is water somewhere else. No one refutes this kind if negation, if they do, it is what is termed an exaggeration, no one argues that saying something is empty of water necessarily implies water elsewhere. Also, no one can argue that the perception of the absence of water is invalid. Sion's thesis, that one cannot perceive an absence is foolish and naive. As I said, he is an idiot.

Many people overlook the fact that the Agamaśāstra, the source Anders alludes to, combines Madhyamaka and Yogacāra views indiscriminately to present a nondual view of Vedanta. This is what influenced Shankara, since Gaudapāda, the author of the Agamaśāstra, was Shankara's guru's guru.

They are quite similar. And why not? Shankara was greatly inspired by Nagarjuna.

Malcolm wrote:
Gzhan stong is not the view of Nagarjuna.

Anders said:
There was neither a "gzhan stong" nor "rang stong" for Shankara to take inspiration from in 8th century India.

But even if there were, how does that relate to what I posited? I am simply saying that it is understandable that Advaita Vedanta and Gzhan stong should be quite similar, given how much inspiration Shankara took from nagarjuna.

Malcolm wrote:
I guess you don't seem to understand here is that gzhan stong isn't derived from Nāgārjuna, but is instead a distortion of Nāgārjuna.

Plus, Western Europe is preparing for a war in Eastern Europe in response to Russian aggression over Ukraine, etc. etc.,

Malcolm wrote:
It breaks the fifth precept. But one does not have to follow the fifth precept at all, in the Tibetan tradition. One can choose to follow only the vows against killing, stealing, and lying.

Of course, if you are a Dzogchen practitioner, there really are no hard and fast rules. You can try anything, but if you get habituated to anything, this is negative.

Everything you really need to know about Mahāyāna is in the Prajñāpāramitā Sūtras and their commentaries.

These are the most important sūtras of Mahāyāna, the most extensive class of sūtras (20 volumes in their Tibetan translation), and the sūtras most commented upon in surviving Indian sources.

Nalanda said:
Also I love that you called out before that some Chinese Sutras are not Sutras. lol
Platform Sutra for example. Can we rely on some notable sutras of East Asian Tradition / Pureland Tradition as sutras?

Malcolm wrote:
It has been the case from the time sutras were being set down in writing that different schools did not accept some or all of sutras of some other school. For example, outside of a very few tantras that were basically too important to exclude, virtually all of the tantras of the Nyingma school were excluded from the official Tibetan canon in the 14th century, including all the most important Dzogchen tantras. But we don't care. Likewise there are many sutras likely composed in China that are important to Chinese Buddhists, and they don't care that we do not accept them. We Mahāyānis in general don't care that the Theravadins do not accept our sūtras, etc.

Besides the Khandro and Vima Nyingthiks what are the main Nyingthik cycles in Nyingma?

The big three are Nyingthik Yabzhi, Gongpa Zangthal and Chetsun Nyingthik right?

Also how do you tell if a cycle is Nyingthik (as opposed to other divisions of Menngagde) or not since just having the word in the name is not a sure indicator and they may not be as detailed as the main three above? Are cycles like Dudjom Saraha Nyingthik and Khandro Thuktik considered as Dzogchen Nyingthik?

Malcolm wrote:
The term "snying thig" in actuality refers to the teaching of the Seventeen Tantras, that is where the term comes from. Of the many teachings called "snying thig," only the Vima Snying thig, Bla ma yang thig, and the Zab mo yang thig are solely devoted to the teachings of the Seventeen Tantras. The mKha' 'gro Snying thig is based in the klong gsal tantra, which is sort of a compilation of the key topics of the Seventeen Tantras. Then there is the Ati zab don of Terdag Lingpa, this is about is stripped down a Dzogchen Snying thig cycle as one is likely to find. Most of the others, including the dgongs pa zang thal, focus mainly on the teachings of the Seventeen Tantras, but have other more elaborate cycles for intermediate practitioners.

All the other snying thigs have supporting practices derived principally from Anuyoga, but their dzogchen teachings are based on the utterly secret unsurpassed cycle, so they can be included in "snying thig". Otherwise, the term "snying thig" has become kind of a popular name.
