How does the framing of the question on terms of " where is X" (regardless of if 'X' is a chariot, the self, or the 'scent of a flower') instead of "what is X" change the question & the answer?


Malcolm wrote:
"Chariot" is a conventional truth, meaning when we hitch it up to horses, etc., we can go places. We know what a chariot is. No one has doubts about what a chariot is.

But where the chariot is, this another issue altogether. Things are designated on a collection of parts. But a given thing cannot be found in any of the parts, all the parts together, or separate from the parts. So where is that given thing? The thing is found in our imputation and no where else. This is why the question of identity is what is this given thing, but where is this given thing. The purpose of this analysis, naturally, is to show that the self is merely an imputation on a collection of aggregates and that is all.

Sherab's analysis merely indicates that ultimate truth is cognition, not that it is an independent reality. In Abhidharma, Vasubandhu says the perception of water is relative truth, the perception of its wetness, coolness, and limpidity is ultimate truth.

Finally, if the ultimate truth of emptiness is not a conventional truth, it will not be effective in bringing about elimination of clinging, etc. Therefore, we say that ultimate truth is part of conventional truth.

To be fair, my post was moved from the original thread to a new one, and taken out of that context seems to be more absolute than I intended it to be.

I'm all for tradition and lineage - my point was that it is counterproductive to hold too tightly to the notion of tradition, glorifying tenets of one while denigrating others (or at least not addressing them at all), worrying too much about whether one belongs in the tradition one is in, or if one should switch traditions, etc. etc.

As was stated elsewhere (including the original thread and here: https://dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f=116&t=27756 ), various highly respected teachers in different traditions have admiration for and utilize parts of "other" traditions - Thai Forest master Ajahn Amaro and Dzogchen, Ajahn Chah himself and Zen, various Vipassana/Secular/IM teachers combining elements of Theravada, Zen, and Tibetan, etc. etc.

Rather than worrying about being "true" to a specific tradition, and especially dismissing other traditions' teachings as impure or irrelevant simply because they are not echoed in one's own tradition, is the exact type of clinging to concepts that is the "enemy" of ALL Buddhist paths.

My point to the OP was - why worry about Mahayana vs. Theravada vs. Vajrayana?  Find what resonates and works, and keep looking.

Malcolm wrote:
In general, this approach does not work well. Find one tradition, find a qualified teacher in that tradition, learn the practice. If you study separate traditions, still you must keep their approaches separate. You cannot mix Dzogchen with Vipassana, for example.

You argument did not address correctly how analysis of the relative is done.  As I mentioned before, analysis of the relative will hit a limit.  But it does not mean that the limit cannot be breached through direct perception.  Until you address this, your reasoning does not hold.
This is so simple really. Can there be an ultimate truth separate from relative truth? No. There is no ultimate independent of the relative. If you say that there is, you have not understood the Buddha's distinction of the two truths. There is no ultimate truth other than the absence of inherent existence in conditioned phenomena.
The Buddha spoke from the perspective of having penetrated to the ultimate but using conventions.  It does not mean that there is no ultimate.  But because your position is that there is no ultimate, I have argued that your position cannot withstand a deist/theist assertion that the Buddha claim that there is no Creator God cannot be true.
You made an assertion, you have not proven it because your thesis is faulty in toto.
Of course there is an external world and it is all because of dependent origination.
That was a typo, meant to say, "there is no external world at all."
Your position in this discussion was that the ultimate truth is the conventional truth.  We have all along been debating this position of yours.
Correct, ultimate truth is a conventional truth because it is efficient in bringing about a result. That is what makes the ultimate truth conventional, as I have explained repeatedly. If you claim the ultimate truth is not conventional, the consequence is that it is also nonfunctional.
My position is that within the constraints of the two extreme of existence and non-existence, there is the ultimate and the relative.  Your position, to put it another way, is that within the region constraint by the two extremes, there is only the relative.  Agree?
My point of view is that within the constraints of the four extremes (there are four, not only two), the relative is not established, and therefore, the ultimate is also not established since it too cannot be established according to any of the four extremes.
Sure, but there is the mind of white appearance, mind of red increase, mind of near attainment.
It is very inappropriate to mix Vajrayāna into a sūtric conversation.
Of course, you would argue that these are not different layers but different degree of subtlety of the mental consciousness.
I am not going to discuss these here: apart from mentioning these experiences are not different kinds of minds.
Even then, there is at least a difference between the sense consciousnesses and the mental consciousness.  The sense consciousnesses depends on the elements.  When the elements dissolve, they dissolve but the mental consciousness remains.  The sense consciousnesses are therefore not fundamental.
The sense consciousnesses and the mental consciousness are the one and same, that is, the "eye-consciousness" is merely consciousness operating though the eye organ, taking form as an object; likewise, the mental consciousness operates through the mental organ, taking the dharma-āyatana/dhatu as its object. All consciousness are included in the vijn̄āna-skandha. There is therefore no distinction between a "fundamental consciousness" on the one hand, and secondary sensory consciousnesses on the other hand. We don't in fact have six consciousnesses, we have only one, given different names when it performs different operations. Likewise, all the vāyus in our body are actually the prāṇa vāyu, but it is given different names depending on whether is assists speech, movement, digestion, circulation, or sense perception.

The more you talk, the more misunderstandings you introduce.

The Gelug is very clear about what the HYT practices are for. The other lineages is not so explicit but that doesn't mean their tsa Lung, tummo etc don't produce similar effects.

Malcolm wrote:
The difference between the example wisdom (jñāna) and the discerning wisdom (prajn̄ā) born of analysis is that one in the former one is introduced to a moment of unfabricated consciousness, where as in mundane discerning wisdom born of analysis one only has a generic image of emptiness.

This moment of unfabricated consciousness is the actual view meditated in trekchö (and mahāmudra, the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, etc.). The view mediated in trekcö, etc, and so on is not a conceptual view born of analysis. Thus, when you see trekchö described as śamatha plus the view, you really need to understand here that view does not refer to the mundane discerning wisdom born of analysis.

Thus, there is a very great difference between trekchö and sūtrayāna. However, the reason it is said that all Mahāyāna schools practice something similar to trekchö is that in the Prajñapāramita, it is said, "There is no mind in the mind, but the mind's original nature (prakrti) is luminous." The Gelugpas term this unfabricated mind "the mind of clear light" in English translation.

So you experience objects apart from colors, sounds, feeling sensations, etc.? I doubt it.
You can doubt whatever you like.  Buddhist models of perception posit three factors:  the sense organ, the object of perception and the sense organ's mind.  Notice how the object of perception is one of the three and not included in the sense organ's mind?  I wonder why?
An object is nothing more than a bundle of perceptions plus a conceptual label. Unless some one can show me an object apart from perceptions.

Where did I say there were absolute boundaries?  All I am saying is that I do not believe that the mind-to-form relationship is a one way street, as you are implying.  Non-dualism does not mean that one overrides the other, but that they mutually influence each other.
What I'm positing is that mind is fundamental because that is what we experience--- we never experience matter. Again, if I'm wrong, please point out what matter is like independent of mind and perception. "Matter" is usually based on some sort of enduring, underlying substance--- in ancient Buddhism, it is the atom-like Dharmas. In the modern West, it is atoms. Both have been refuted.

"Sense consciousness" is merely a name for one's consciousness when it is operating through a sense organ. When it is not, it is mental consciousness. There are no layers of consciousness beyond that.

Queequeg said:
Pilgrimage has arguably had a prominent place in Buddhist practice, particularly lay practice, from very early on. In Japanese Buddhism with which I am most familiar, it is a significant practice even today, and it seems important in other places around Asia, too. In the West it does not seem to figure into practice much... Perhaps because we don't have significant places to visit, yet.

How do you view pilgrimage practice? Is pilgrimage part of your practice?

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddha enjoined all followers to visit the four main sites: Lumbini, Bodhgaya, Sarnath (Deer park), and Kushinagara where he passed away.

I would opine that pilgrimage is very important to all Buddhists. We should all make an effort to visit these four crucial places.

Do you interpret that "do not exist" in the nihilistic sense where there is no possibility of a continuum of the meditator or the dharmadhatu (in other words, no possibility of freedom from the two extremes)?

Malcolm wrote:
In (ultimate) reality there is no meditator nor a dharmadhātu. All such distinctions are conventional. I don't negate these things conventionally speaking, but ultimately they cannot be established at all.

With respect to this issue, I follow the position of the Jetsun Sakya Gongma who declare, "there is no reality (gnas lugs med pa)" and always have. In other words, since the four extremes cannot be established for relative phenomena, there is no way the four extremes can exist in the ultimate either. This being so, there is no reality as there isn't anything established which can be free from the four extremes. The ultimate is considered inexpressible not because it is something free from the four extremes, it is inexpressible because nothing can established by way of the four extremes either relatively or ultimately.

As the Samputa Tantra puts it:

Nothing empty, nothing not empty, and nothing to perceive in the middle.

Sherab said:
This seems to be a rather evasive reply.

My reasoning for maintaining that there is a difference between the relative and the ultimate is simply this.  If the ultimate is truly indescribable, then you cannot say that it is truly non-existent.  If it is truly non-existent, then the word "non-existent" would be an accurate and exact description.  If the ultimate cannot be described, then it truly cannot be described.  And all we can say is what it is not and not what it is.  Also, since we can say what the relative is, and since we cannot say what the ultimate is, the ultimate and the relative cannot be the same.

Malcolm wrote:

Sherab said:
In brief, my view is that Buddhist ontology is simply that reality is constraint within the two extremes.  Within this constraint, there is the ultimate reality and there is the relative reality.  The ultimate is not deceptive but the ultimate [sic] is.  The nature of the ultimate is the nature of the relative, so one can say that ultimately, the ultimate truth is the same as the relative truth.  But we cannot say that the ultimate is the relative.

In analyzing the relative, we look at the appearance and then ask what is underneath that appearance.  So we look at an apple and see that it is formed from molecules.  The apple therefore does not exist at the level of the molecules.  The apple therefore is simply the appearance of the apple if we don't look at the underlying reality of the apple.  Similarly, when we look at a molecule, we see that it is comprised of atoms.  At the level of the atom, the molecule does not exist and is simply an appearance.  When we look at an atom, we see that it comprises other particles such as quarks and electrons.  Science has managed only to penetrate to this level of reality.  Beyond that, it is still speculative.  Taking the analysis to its logical conclusion, we come to the ultimate reality which is the basis of all the relative realities above it.

Malcolm wrote:
All this shows is that an "ultimate" is just a limit of one's analysis. Glad we agree on that —— though it is a little odd to say that a limitation of analysis is the basis of anything at all.

Sherab said:
Therefore, the ultimate is not deceptive and all the various levels of relative realities above it are deceptive.  According to the Buddha, this ultimate cannot be described.  He did not say that it exists or did not exists.  This is all we can say.

In normal usage, one would expect that when we see the words "ultimate truth", we would take the words as a holder for the entity that the words are pointing to.  For example, when we see the word "apple", we see it as pointing to the entity apple.  If we want to indicate something that deviate from the convention, we would qualify the word used.  For example, we want to refer to an apple of a specific colour, we would use the words "the red apple".

Therefore, when we see the word "ultimate truth", it would be reasonable to expect those words to point to the actual entity of ultimate truth.  If we want to indicate something that deviate from the common understanding, say we want to point to an ultimate truth that is a concept, we would use the words "conceptual ultimate truth".

So when come across the word "ultimate truth" or "the ultimate" in the sutras, it would be reasonable to take those words as pointing to the entity of ultimate truth or the entity of ultimate.  If not, the sutras, will not make any sense.  If the conceptual understanding of the ultimate is being referred to, this should be obvious based on the context.  For example, the Buddha said in the Samdhinirmocana that

"the ultimate is realized individually by the Aryas"
    "the ultimate belongs to the signless realm"
    "the ultimate is inexpressible"
    "the ultimate is devoid of conventions."


Malcolm wrote:
Another citation (and this is as far away from Hua Yen as one can get), because it is useful— Mipham, commenting on Mañjuśrīmitra's Meditation of Bodhicitta states:


Since neither the state of affliction nor of purification [10/a] is established, because awakening (buddhahood) and non-awakening (sentient beinghood) are the same in terms of being equally without characteristics, there is no buddhahood to accept or sentient beinghood to reject.

Also, if the ultimate is not established, where will one see words that state “It is like this?” If there is an analysis in accordance with the meaning of how it is explained, all of those explanations for the so called “nominal ultimate”, “absence of arising and ceasing”, “sameness”, “nonduality”, “beyond thought”, “emptiness”, “the dharmadhātu”, and so on are didactic conventions. In the true definitive meaning, they are neither ultimate nor are they relative. If there is the perception, “The path is like this in accordance with the ultimate (which  is not a convention),” then that is relative, but not ultimate. In reality, where is there a “relative and ultimate” that are inseparable as the two truths?

Mañjuśrīmitra's very next passage states:


Do not abandon or dwell in any Dharma at all, with or without doubt. 
Since the meditator and the dharmadhātu do not exist, there is nothing to doubt and there is nothing to perceive as ultimate.

MIpham expands on this:

Since the Dharma of those with doubt who have not seen the true meaning and those without doubt who have seen it in realty is neither true nor false at all, do not abandon the false nor dwell in the true. If it is asked why, in reality, because the meditator and the dharmadhātu do not exist, who has doubts about something? [10/b] Therefore, there is also nothing to perceive as ultimate in the Dharma that is without doubt because in scripture it is said that it is necessary for one to abandon craving to conducive Dharma and aversion to unconducive Dharma.

None of the citations that you provided support your contention as I have mentioned before although you may insist that they do:

Nāgārjuna states:
Without depending on convention, the ultimate cannot be explained;
without realizing the ultimate, nirvana will not be obtained.
"Without depending on convention, the ultimate cannot be explained" does not imply that you can say "the ultimate = the conventional" or "the ultimate truth = the conventional truth".  You depend on the Dharma boat to get to the shore of liberation, but this does not entail that the Dharma boat is the shore of liberation.

Malcolm wrote:
The teaching of ultimate truth is the boat, not the other shore. This is why it a conventional truth.

Sherab said:
Candrakīriti states in the Madhyamakāvatāra:
"Because all entities can be seen correctly and falsely,
entities possess a dual nature;
the correct perception of any object is true;
the false perception is called "realtive."
Also false perception is asserted to be of two kinds,
clear sense organs and faulty sense organs."
There correct perception (1), false but unfaulty perception (2),  and false and faulty perception (3).  It does not follow that (1) = (2) or (2) = (3) or (1) = (3) or (1) = (2) = (3).  In fact, it is patently incorrect to make such equations.  You will have no problem in disagreeing that (2) = (3), yet you seem to have problem in rejecting the others.

Malcolm wrote:
I never stated that 1 = 2. In other words, I never stated that veridical perceptions equalled non-veridical perceptions. I cited that so you would understand what an ultimate truth was since I was not, and am still not certain that you do not have a realist position with regard to suchness. For example, Advaitans deny that brahmin falls into the two extremes, and yet, they are still realists. The same applies to Yogacāra. Your comment about "other shores" leads me to believe you think nirvana is something other than the simple cessation of afflictions that cause rebirth.

I stated that ultimate true has to be a conventional truth in order to be functional for the worldly people. See next point.

Sherab said:
Candrakīrti states in his commentary on the 70: 
Relative truth and ultimate truth are conventions used by the noble ones.
And:
Here, these are true through the power of a worldly, undistorted consciousness, and are defined as ultimate truth through the power of this absence of distortion.
And:
"Uimate truth" is expressed on the basis of worldly convention."
What is the purpose of using conventions?  So that you can convey the meaning.  Just because the worlds "relative truth" and "ultimate truth" are used to convey meaning, does not mean that you can equate the meanings carried by the two sets of words.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct, we are conveying meaning with words. This is why Bhavaviveka distinguishes two kinds of ultimate, enumerated or nominal, which is conventional, and an unenumerated ultimate which is not within the range of convention since it cannot be experienced by worldlings, but only by āryas.

A true relative truth is the apprehension of a functional object that is mistaken about the object's nature (self of phenomena). Such a relative truth is called conventional to indicate its functionality. Thus, when we describe emptiness, ultimate truth, this description, while ultimately true, is nevertheless part of conventional truth. When we cognize emptiness as an object below the path of seeing, it is only nominally an ultimate, thus, it is still conventional because it is not a direct perception of emptiness, but only an approximation.

Recently my wife floated the idea of me getting a vasectomy once we've either had our second and last child, or once we've decided we're gonna be one and done. She wasn't insistent, so that's not an issue, and I can't help but sympathize with her position of all other methods of birth control being basically all on her. But my concern is whether a surgery like this would be damaging to practice of Secret Mantra in general, and Dzogchen in particular. What say you, Malcolm, and others? Anyone spoke to their lama about this? I know my wife would take yet another one for the team if I told her it would be harmful to my practice. But would it?

Astus said:
The selflessness of person is that there is no person, only the aggregates, while the selflessness of phenomena is that the aggregates themselves are without essence. The sutra talks about how phenomena themselves are dependent and without any will of their own, so it matches what the Lankavatara Sutra (2.24, tr Red Pine) says: "And what does it mean to know that dharmas have no self? It means to be aware that the self-existence of the skandhas, dhatus, and ayatanas is imaginary, that the skandhas, dhatus, and ayatanas are devoid of a self or anything that belongs to a self, that the skandhas, dhatus, and ayatanas are assemblages tied to desire and karma and that they arise from the interplay of conditions but are themselves passive, and that all dharmas are like this."

As to your argument quoted above, are you saying that:
(1) It is not possible to gain insights from meditation when the meditator merely follows the meditation instructions from his teacher?

Malcolm wrote:
That depends on the instruction -- for example, there is no reason to assume anyone will give rise to vipaśyāna solely on the basis of śamatha instructions.

Sherab said:
(2) The so-called village meditators in Tibet were purportedly illiterate ordinary folks were not really illiterate ordinary folks and the stories have not even the tiniest element of truth?

Malcolm wrote:
Even the greatest scholar is ordinary if they have not realized the path of seeing. If those stories contain instructions which present the enumerated ultimate, it is possible that such illiterate folks will awaken if they meditate accordingly.

Sherab said:
(3) Those who do not comprehend tantric sadhanas should not have any expectation of realization when they are given the sadhanas as a practice commitment?  If so, why did the guru bother to give the commitment in the first place?

Malcolm wrote:
Insights gained from tantric practice are based in the example wisdom introduced at the time of the third and fourth empowerment, but this example wisdom is conceptual; not nonconceptual— hence the term "word empowerment."

Sherab said:
(4) Faith by itself can never be a valid path even if that faith is placed on an enlightened being?

Malcolm wrote:
Faith is part of the merit accumulation, so, it is an indirect cause.

Sherab said:
(5) If all beings have Buddha nature, that nature cannot be accessed in any other way except through intellectual comprehension?

If you are indeed referring to other form of comprehension, then you should have made it clear from the start.)

Malcolm wrote:
Tathāgatagarbha cannot be seen by any one other than buddhas. It is clearly taught it is something we are to have faith in. It is not something we can directly perceive.


Sherab said:
As to the root of our argument, this is how I see it:
(1) When you say that the ultimate truth is a conventional truth, while you are using conventions in your argument, your argument as I see it, is a statement of ontology.  Your statement points to the what ultimate truth actually is.  Your statement says that ontology of ultimate truth is the ontology of relative truth.  If so, your statement should be amended to "the nature of the ultimate truth is the nature of the relative truth".  Here veridical cognition is required to ascertain both the nature of the ultimate truth and the nature of relative/conventional truth.

Malcolm wrote:
I am not making an ontological statement, and neither is Nāgārjuna, it is rather a statement of pedagogy.

Sherab said:
(2) If by ultimate truth, you are referring to the enumerated ultimate truth (the intellectual understanding of ultimate truth or ultimate truth as a concept.  Here non-veridical cognition is all that is required.), then yes, the statement that the ultimate truth is a conventional truth can apply.

Malcolm wrote:
I have provided adequate citations that indicate that the only ultimate truth which can be referred to is the enumerated ultimate. The non-enumerated ultimate cannot be put into words.

Sherab said:
The questions I have for you then are:
(1) When you make your statement that "the ultimate truth is conventional truth", were you referring to the actual inexpressible ultimate truth or were you referring to the enumerated ultimate truth?

Malcolm wrote:
Since I was using words, I was referring the enumerated ultimate. Of course, even the non-enumerated ultimate is merely the direct perception of the emptiness of a given conventional thing.

Sherab said:
(2) If you were referring to the enumerated ultimate truth, are you saying that that is the conventional use of the term ultimate truth?  That when the label ultimate truth is used, it should always be treated as enumerated ultimate truth unless otherwise stated?  If so, any reader should be able to go to any sutras and commentaries and substitute every instance of the label "ultimate truth" with "enumerated ultimate truth" and the sutra or commentary will still make sense?

Malcolm wrote:
Anytime you see the ultimate truth expressed in words, it needs to be understood as an example ultimate.

The term "ultimate truth" simply represents a limit of analysis, btw. This is why the ultimate truths of śrāvakas are overthrown by Madhyamaka. Madhyamaka is the only school also which uses no affirming negations but only non-affirming negations.

The main thrust of my point however is that without intellectual comprehension of the example ultimate, the actual ultimate truth cannot be realized. Thus, we have to accept the conventional ultimate as necessary since it is functional in the production of the result, nirvana.

There is https://dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?t=25259#p383673 on DharmaWheel that I found that addresses this. The Tibetan chos nyid dbyings is specifically dharmatādhātu not dharmadhātu, correct?

Could the poor attestation of dharmatādhātu on the internet be because of the availability of Sanskrit texts available romanized?

Malcolm wrote:
The term itself is mainly confined to the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, but you can see many sūtras where the term dharmatā is systematically related to dharmadhātu. For example, the Bodhisattvapitika sutra among others makes the following statement:

That dharmatā should be understood to be a place, therefore, the dharmadhātu is called "a place."

Or, The Sarvabuddha-viṣayāvatāra-jñānālokālaṃkāra-sūtra states:

Whether the tathāgatas arise or not, dharmatā, dharmasthitikatā, and this dharmadhātu are only places.

The equivalence of this trio is repeated over and over again in the order, dharmatā, dharmadhātu and dharmasthitikatā.

If ultimate truth is conventional truth, then since conventional truth is deceptive, the ultimate truth must also be deceptive.

It is really puzzling for me how someone like you who clearly understands that in terms of strength of an argument, the least is one that relies on authority, followed by one the relies on logical and valid reasoning, with the strongest being one that relies on direct perception.

Malcolm wrote:
I think you not really understand well the content of the authorities in our discussions, preferring instead to rely on your own musings— this is why with you, I insist on bringing up the texts, because you never reason based on citations. As Āryadeva notes in the 400, since we share the same school, citations are appropriate. If we did not, I would not use citations at all.

Now, from what I can see, you seem to think that an ultimate truth is something other than a cognition of an object. Thus we have a basic disagreement over terminology.

1) An enumerated ultimate truth can only be a conventional truth, and this is something that all Madhyamaka masters accept. The so-called non-enumerated ultimate truth cannot be explained in words at all since it is the ārya's direct perception of emptiness.

2) When an ordinary, worldly person engages in analysis to ascertain emptiness, that enumerated ultimate truth, their perception of an inferential emptiness, is simply a convention which means, "I have reached the limit of my ability to analyze this object, and all I can come up with is that it is empty of inherent existence." That perception of emptiness, while designated an ultimate truth, is confined to conventional truth because it is the inferential perception of a mundane person. Thus, even this ultimate truth is non-veridical since it is an inference and not a direct perception. How are inferences non-veridical? for example, it is like mistaking mist for smoke and inferring there is a fire, or perceiving a mirage and inferring there is water. Even the common direct perceptions (mist, mirage) of the worldly are no insurance that their cognitions are veridical.

3) When an ārya explains their yogic direct perception of emptiness to worldlings, this ultimate truth is still a conventional truth i) because it is expressed in words and ii) because the perception of worldlings is by definition non-veridical. Why do we call this ultimate truth a conventional truth? Because it is functional in assisting the direct perception of emptiness. Āryas use either consequences or syllogisms to induce conceptual understanding of emptiness — but that is still an enumerated ultimate truth and thus, by definition, is a part of conventional truth. But as already stated, it is not part of false relative truth because conventional truths are functional. When we see a car, we can drive it. When we study the path, we can traverse it

If the enumerated ultimate truth is not a conventional truth, there is no way ordinary people can realize the non-enumerated ultimate truth, in other words, there is no way they can move from an inferential perception of emptiness on the path of application to the direct perception of emptiness on the path of seeing because ordinary people's cognitions are always deluded with respect to the true existence of things— even after they have analyzed phenomena and found them to be conventionally empty. That conventional emptiness is an ultimate truth, but as it does not have the power to still proliferation on its own, hence, it is also part of conventional truth.

Nothing about dharmatā, in the word itself, signals it out as referring exclusively to the emptiness of any "particular" dharmāḥ instead of just "dharmāḥ in general", à la dharmadhātu. From where does this distinction come?

Dharmatā & dharmadhātu are completely identical, functionally, afaik, in their translated Chinese correspondences (i.e. they are synonyms in Chinese, more or less), but Chinese does all sorts of "interesting" things to Indic grammar & semantics.

Malcolm wrote:
tā makes it a nature. dhātu makes it a field. In this usage, dharmatā means emptiness. Of course, the term has many different uses, for example, it indicates the predicate of an argument in Logic, whereas dharmin represents the subject.

You should consult the Dharmadharmatāvibhanga by Maitreyanātha for a Yogacāra take on this, based on the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra, which itself has a whole section on the distinction between dharmas and their dharmatā, and how they can neither be the same nor different.

Well, I think this difference is that a person never arose; there is no such thing as an atman, which is why Jñānaśribhadra compared an atman with something permanent that does not arise, hence it does not exist at all, like the son of a barren women, etc. The selflessness of phenomena on the other hand is the recognition of that karma and affliction arise from proliferation due to clinging to conventional truth, i.e. clinging to functional phenomena. The first, the absence of self in persons is coarse; realizing it eliminates the afflictive obscuration; the second, the absence of self in phenomena is more subtle, and when realized, eliminates the knowledge obscuration.

Refute the above argument if you can.  If not, do not make wild allegations of misrepresentation of your position as it only serves to diminish your status.

Malcolm wrote:
Nāgārjuna states:

Without depending on convention, the ultimate cannot be explained;
without realizing the ultimate, nirvana will not be obtained.

Candrakīriti states in the Madhyamakāvatāra:

"Because all entities can be seen correctly and falsely,
entities possess a dual nature;
the correct perception of any object is true;
the false perception is called "realtive."
Also false perception is asserted to be of two kinds,
clear sense organs and faulty sense organs."

The point here is that one must have an entity in question in order to have a correct or incorrect perception. And those entities are themselves established on the basis of worldly convention which we are not supposed to contravene. The two truths are also conventions, as Candrakīrti states in his commentary on the 70:

Relative truth and ultimate truth are conventions used by the noble ones.

And:

Here, these are true through the power of a worldly, undistorted consciousness, and are defined as ultimate truth through the power of this absence of distortion.

And:

"Uimate truth" is expressed on the basis of worldly convention."

The reason we can say that ultimate truth is conventional is that is it is functional. If ultimate truth was not functional, its perception could not lead to liberation.

I suspect that you are conflating "truths," which are subjective perceptions, with emptiness. All objects have an ultimate nature, emptiness, which is a truth for those who can see it and is conventionally expressed as such. Also emptiness can be an object of distorted consciousness, which is why there are warnings about not apprehending it incorrectly.

Moreover, Candra says:

Any fabricated entity which appears as true
is that which the Muni called relative truth."

In other words, the perception that entities that arise from cause and conditions are true is what we call relative truth. The perception that they are not true because they are empty is what we call ultimate truth.

Below the path of seeing that ultimate truth can only be a conventional truth because that perception is merely an approximation of the actual lack of inherent existence or absence of the four extremes for a given thing. Such a mundane perception of the ultimate truth of emptiness may be tinged with delusion because it is relative, but since it is functional in bringing about realization, it is conventional.

Finally, the two truths are in union because they exist as aspects of any given entity. There is no ultimate truth beyond entities that are known to the world.

Ālayavijñāna (Skt., Tib. kun gzhi rnam par shes pa) - the unified field of consciousness in the Universe. This universal mind is each individual's higher consciousness. Each living being is an individual "spark" of this one vast whole, in which we breathe and move and have our being. This whole universal consciousness is the living Cosmos itself, constantly evolving through the totality of all experience, and growing ever more "aware" over billions of years. Like a great ocean, the lives of all beings, planetary worlds and star-systems leave their impressions, or imprints, within the whole, which become stored, as it were, in the total body of Universal Mind. Ultimately this is the meaning of life, for we are all contributing our lives to the conscious whole, and the conscious whole is a growing entity moving towards eventual self-reflexive awakening. This is an uniquely mystical doctrine perceived through direct insight by the Masters of the Yogācāra tradition.

This definition is very mistaken. Whoever wrote this is completely ignorant of Yogacāra. No educated Tibetan scholar of any school would accept this definition.

Thanks Malcolm. In regard to an earlier comment regarding patrons/taxes and your comment here about "support us directly" can you expand a bit? Do you mean a direct cash contribution to you as an individual or rather a charitable donation to a registered not-for-profit that works on supporting translators/translations. I ask because I would like to find a way to further support the important translation work needed for some specific Buddhist traditions.

Malcolm wrote:
In the United States, anyone may gift anyone else up to 13,000 (the amount changes yearly) without either you or the person who is receiving the gift needing to report it to the Feds. It is thus better to make gifts directly. If you pass it through a nonprofit, the amount the nonprofit tenders the recipient is treated as earned income and taxed accordingly.


jake said:
The economics of getting an established publisher to edit, layout, print and distribute books in traditions with a limited Western audience can be a real headache. I imagine this is what lead to the establishment of some of the publishers you've mentioned previous?

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, though of course Wisdom is a non-profit, Shambhala is a regular corporation, and then Universities have their own thing.

If you want to support the general publication of Dharma books, a donation to Wisdom is a good idea,  and if you want to support a given tradition, an earmarked donation is what I recommend. If you want to support a translator directly, then, directly gifting them money up to the untaxed amount is the way to go.

I tried the dharmawheel search function but that didn't bring me anywhere. I'd appreciate any advice on a good read. Thanks.

Just to add: the same counts for compassion. A basic term I also don't get applied easily. When should I take action? Or not? In German we have Mitleid (co-suffering) whilst compassion in the dharmic context is translated as Mitgefühl (co-feeling). Does it mean just being empathic, abstaining from any action is the way to go?!

This thread is many years old but it is worth adding more.

Besides the many amazing skillful means already mentioned that generate merit, I'll like to add recitation of King aspiration prayer of Bodhisattva Samantabhadra. I don't find many teachings in English but that are many in Chinese language. Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok said that if there is anything that he was still attached, it is the merit that everyone of his sangha member will recite this prayer at least once a day. The late Yangthang Rinpoche said that this is the most powerful prayer in sutrayana while Prayer of Kuntuzangpo is the most powerful prayer in tantrayana and there is an urgency to recite the former prayer many times these days. One eminent Sakya lama (name not specified) as mentioned by Khenpo Sodargye taught that reciting this prayer 3 times a day together with a short pureland practice will guarantee transference to western pureland at death (even more certain than powa practice).

This prayer is recited by all Monlams at Bodh Gaya each year, so the merit must really be fantastic.

Assuming that this is the case, how do we propose that a history of a single practice such as shikantaza or koan introspection arises? Does this only happen in Japan or does it also happen elsewhere in Zen/Ch’an/Seon/Thein? Or does it fact arise? Could it be omissions in translation or understanding? Or does a unified practice simply encompass what both practices previously encompass? It’s an interesting question from a historical perspective, because one could assume no teacher from India could have proposed it? It could simply be that Zen represents a mashup of things on more than one level?

The goal of śamatha and vipaśyāna is to unify them. Some people have the capacity to unify them from the beginning, i.e., leaping with both feet; but most people can't leap very far and make more progress by first taking one step (śamatha), then another step (vipaśyāna) and so on, gradually developing their abilities.

Mr. Carson’s suggestion that ordinary Germans, had they had guns, would have risked their lives in armed resistance against the regime simply does not comport with the regrettable historical reality of a regime that was quite popular at home.

I thought the point of the story was that the arya, perceiving that the man was about to commit murder and thereby condemn himself to a long period of suffering, pre-emptively kills the man and takes upon himself the negative karma thereof but by so doing prevents the man from suffering a worse fate. An non-arya would have lacked the ability to perceive the mans future actions and their consequences correctly and would therefore be unable to do the required karmic calculus. It was for that reason that I said that a non-arya has no business making that choice.

An AR-15 is not a military weapon...it was designed by Colt to look like an M-16 and sold to LE and civilians..... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_AR-15


Malcolm wrote:
Huh? The AR-15 is was not designed by Colt at all. It was designed by Armalite Rifles for the Army. It is absolutely a military weapon by design. The M-16 was Colt's rebranding of the AR-15. The M4, the present iteration of the AR-15, is merely an updated version of the original AR-15.

The stat of 13 RPS is based on its engineering specs. Practically speaking, fire rates of more than 2 RPS are unrealistic for any sustained amount of time.

That means a person can unload a 30 round clip at a crowd in one minute with ease. It takes about fifteen seconds to eject an empty clip and insert a full one. One can therefore plausibly get off a 120 rounds in three minutes and 30 thirty seconds.

This rate of fire is unnecessary for any civilian application.

The M-16 only ever fired on full auto for suppressive fire, because it is not a very accurate automatic weapon. It overheats and quickly jams. In fact, in most military uses, the M-!6, and now M4, is switched to semi-automatic for accuracy since it is presumed you are aiming at a human being.

Fa Dao said:
Back in the mid-1980s -- before the shift to the M16A2 and the three-round burst -- active-duty infantry units kept to a strict rule that rifleman only fired their M16A1s on semi auto. Today's combat-experienced infantrymen are even more disciplined.

Malcolm wrote:
https://www.military.com/kitup/2011/12/full-auto-battlefield-necessity.html

The only difference between the M-16 class of rifles and the AR-15 is that without a cheap modification, the AR-15 only fires on semi-auto. Therefore, this idea that the full auto mode is the important distinguishing feature in a rifle is nonsense. In reality, soldiers rarely use the full auto mode, and generally only when ordered to do so, which is rare.

There is little difference in the kind of round an AR-15 is designed to shoot as opposed to the M-16/M-4 (5.56 NATO round based on the .223 Remington). The main difference, ironically, is that civilians rounds are designed to cause MORE damage to the target since it is assumed the target will either be an animal or someone trying to harm you. Military rounds are FMJs, and do not cause as much terminal damage as civilian rounds are able to do.

So, frankly, your rebuttal is flawed for many reasons. You neglect to note:

Fa Dao said:
Colt's Manufacturing Company currently uses the AR-15 trademark for its line of semi-automatic AR-15 rifles that are marketed to civilian and law-enforcement customers.

Malcolm wrote:
If you read further on the page, you will discover two things: 1. The AR-15 sold by Colt today is exactly the same design that Stoner created and patented for Armalite when they developed the weapon for the US Military.

2. Since the patent elapsed, many other gun manufacturers have been designing tactical rifles that either are based directly on the AR-15 or design tactical rifles with significant modifications in design and ammunition. Nevertheless, all of these use civilian rounds which are much more damaging even than FMJ military rounds. And all of these rifles can fire military rounds, which the military sells as surplus.

We really must stop pretending that the single shot Remington bolt action Model 700 hunting rifle is as dangerous as an AR-15.

Buddha Sakyamuni was undeniably an atheist.  He stated clearly that there is no Creator God.  That being the case, Buddhist ontology must be founded on natural laws.  There are no two ways about it.  From a buddhist viewpoint, the law of karma is therefore a natural law akin to a conservation law in science such as the conservation of information.

Therefore it should not be surprising that the Buddha taught that one should not engage in the killing of any sentient beings.  If you do intend to kill any sentient being, you will have to face the consequences, whether immediate, in the future or in a future life.

As to the eating of fish out of starvation, the state of starvation that one finds oneself in would be a ripening of one's past karma.  By resorting to killing fish in order to fend off one's starvation is to create new karma for oneself that will ripen in future.  (Of course, if the fish died naturally, then there is no negative karma associated with eating that fish.)  This is a decision that one has to make, and what that decision will be depend on how much one has internalized the Dharma.

Important context:

Gun ownership in the US is actually not so popular as you might think, even though there is a metric shit-ton of weaponry piled up.  How so?  The Guardian did a good job laying this out some months ago.

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/oct/02/us-gun-control-ownership-violence-statistics

Less that one-third of US households own a firearm today.  That's less than it has been in decades past.  So proportionately fewer households own guns.  How, then, to explain the trend of increased gun ownership?  About 3% of the population are hoarding weapons and ammo.

And these aren't sport weapons anymore.  The "tactical turn" is a real problem.  This is a change in US gun culture that has happened over the last twenty years or so.  When I was in my early 20s, most of the guns for sale at your local sporting goods outlet would be explicitly for hunting or basic home or self defense.  Think of the typical 30-06 Springfield hunting rifle with a walnut stock, or your grandfather's duck gun.  These pieces are more fun to shoot than a "tactical" weapon like an ar-15, but they have fallen out of favor with the macho-insecurity set.

Thanks for posting that article. The numbers do raise the question of how, exactly, the NRA became so politically powerful. Before Wayne LaPierre it really wasn't - GHB publicly cancelled his membership and criticized them over LaPierre's behaviour during his presidency, which is something unthinkable for a republican today. They've clearly done a remarkably good job of mobilizing the small, paranoid minority for whom this is an important issue. This segment - disproportionately rural, white and lower-income - was also very badly covered by the democrats over the past few decades.

There is no doubt sambhogakāya was elaborated to solve certain problems raised by "real buddhas" attaining buddhahood in Akaniṣṭha in the Lanka, but the point is that there was no systematic presentation of three kāyas prior to Maitreyanatha, hence my point stands.

pueraeternus said:
But the eight consciousness, etc were also systematized and elaborated by Yogacarins and laid the groundwork of how later Buddhists understand and debate these topics, so why focus only on the three kayas?

Malcolm wrote:
Because the three kāyas were the only doctrine that were basically adopted by Madhyamakas like Candrakīrti following the Maitreyan synthesis; the eight consciousnesses and so on were not universally accepted by Madhyamakas, and even today are not.

Unknown said:
With respect to the so called niṣyandabuddha = sambhoghākāya, this is really only Suzuki's opinion.

The commentary on the Lanka by Jñānaśribhadra states this concept in only one place: a buddha produced from ripening is a form that arises from the ripening (nisyanda) of the merit and wisdom accumulations, while the buddhas of emanation are those who show nirvana.

And the Lanka is the only sūtra which uses the term "niṣyandabuddha," so I think that is a pretty weak position of Suzuki's, very tentative and not proven at all.

Malcolm wrote:
Asvabhava equates the nisyandakaya as the sambhogakaya. So this is not just Suzuki's opinion. Unless you want to quibble about the words -kaya and -buddha.
Well, it is Asanga who does that, in the closing words of the Mahāyānasamgraha, where niṣyanda is used as an adjective to describe the sambhogakāya where the issue of the impermanence of the sambhogakāya and nirmanakāya are raised. So I am still not convinced it is the intent of the Lanka that one can claim that niṣyandabuddha = sambhogakāya since the person who wrote down the Lanka seems to ignore the term entirely, where as nirmāṇa used in association with the rūpakāya of the Buddha has an old history.

Niṣyanda means "corresponding cause," rgyu mthun pa, though in the Lanka there is still come influence from an earlier Chinese translation where the term is translated as rnam smin, ripened, which is normally reserved for vipaka.  Interestingly, this term is completely absent from any of the five treatises, nor can it be found in any of the works on Abhisamayālaṃkāra.

Thus, I think it is still fair to say that the Yogacāra school really was responsible for the elaboration of the three kāyas over the older two kāya model, and it was elaborated to explain issues the two kāya model was not equipped to deal with. Most interestingly, Maitreyanatha imposes the three kāya model on the Perfection of Wisdom Sūtras, in which the terms sambhogakāya, niṣyandabuddha, etc., are completely absent. There is something there to consider.

When we examine sūtras by when they were translated into Chinese, not one sūtra translated into Chines predates the Maitreyan synthesis containing the term "saṃbhoga" with one or two possible exceptions. The Ārya-dharmasaṃgīti-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra mentions a Sambhogabuddha -- this was translated by Gunabhadra between 412-421. It says:

If it is asked what is a sambhogabuddha, a sambhogabuddha is
equivalent in enjoyment and practice with bodhisattvas, equivalent in
aspects, food, speech, procedures, and conduct.

Maitreyanatha actually uses this term as well. He says in the MSL:

Because pristine consciousness is the cause of everything,
pristine consciousness is similar to a great source;
it is the sambhogabuddha
because it produces the reflection of pristine consciousness.

The longer Suvarṇaprabhāsa Sūtra in Tibetan also has a chapter on the three kāyas, however, it seems quite likely that this chapter was a later addition, added after the time of Vasubandhu.

So in this case, if there is a canonical source for the term saṃbhoga, it would seem to be the reference to it in the Dharmasaṃgīti. Even so, it is not systematic, and it is a very slim basis for the elaborated system of three kāyas we find in the Maitreyan synthesis. Thus, I still stand by my observation that the most significant addition to Dharma by the Yogacara school is the doctrine of three kāyas

pueraeternus said:

karma-vibhaṅga
karma-śataka

https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.136.nymo.html

The Diamond Sutra has some references to karma, as it sets out how we can overcome the fear of birth and death. A diamond itself is a composite of various materials and conditions coming together. The diamond was created in a sense by the earth itself and vice versa(!). Without gravity, specific elements, pressure, a certain geology, it couldn’t have developed into what we now term a diamond. We ourselves are aggregates that coincide. The five skandhas are reborn every moment of time/space. yet that they lack any permanence/essence. All is empty, as in the quote on empty phenomena you provided, Malcolm.
You should should understand that the title Vajracchedika means "Diamond cutter," i.e. it is a reference the perfection of wisdom which cuts through even the hardest things.

If at all possible this changing of the narrative needs to be done in such a way that is not viewed as being confrontational. I really don't believe that creating even more laws is going to change much of anything until the dominant narrative is changed. Unfortunately this will take at least a couple of generations of diligent effort....sadly I don't think there is any "quickfix" for this problem.

Where Rinpoche simply mentions "Buddhas of the five families", Karma Lingpa goes into explicit detail about their colors, hand implements, etc. I guess for students with some capacity, Rinpoche's instructions really are all you need

I consider it to be. For instance 2 years ago I went through extreme pain for 3 days leading to a hospitalization. But during that pain there was no suffering, only pain (and a hour of Bliss) if that would have happened 5 years before the pain would have been suffering too. I also see suffering in the past was due to imagination and I see family and friends and other beings suffering, but to them it's real the suffering as it was to me. So to me pain is inevitable but suffering is optional, then again I also see it's not optional for so many poor souls. Things I once called suffering are now figments of imagination, though I might experience suffering in the future I do realize what I called suffering in the past was an imagination.

Malcolm wrote:
There are three kinds of suffering taught by the Buddha: The first is the suffering of suffering, which generally involves intense pain, mental or physical. The second is the suffering of change. These first two are related to sensations. The third is called the pervasive suffering, which is the simple fact that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent and in a constant state of disintegration. This is the most difficult suffering to overcome since it is not related to sensation at all. The only way to overcome this suffering is to attain nirvana.

It appears you think that dukkha is an emotional involvement with pain, but this is not so. All pain is dukkha, since it is the ripening of negative karma on the body (and negative karma only ripens on the body). All pleasure or bliss is the ripening of positive karma, and positive karma ripens only on the mind.

The question then seems to be, do brains, biological or mechanical, provide the necessary mechanisms for self-awareness? Or is there something else required for self-awareness?

PeterC said:
That is the question.  Without resorting to “it depends what you mean by...” games, it’s difficult to answer as self-awareness is neither transpersonal nor objectively observable. So how does one assert its existence or not.

In the extreme case, self-awareness cannot simply be the self being aware of the self, in complete isolation from external phenomena.  Even the formless realms posit more stimuli than that. Awareness of self this has to be awareness of the self as distinct from other objects of awareness. In which case the brain alone is insufficient.

Malcolm wrote:
There are no stimuli at all in the formless āyatanas since there are no physical sense organs for beings of the formless āyatanas. Without vitarka and vicara, they cannot switch objects and remain focused solely on the conceptual samadhi that propelled their birth, without any other stimulation. It is doubtful they are self-aware except in the most basic sense that their innate grasping at self assisted their afflictive rebirth in this realm.

PeterC said:
I’m struggling with this because the only type of self-awareness that we can posit to answer this question is the unenlightened dualistic awareness. You’d have to answer the question in a very different way if we were talking about non-dualistic awareness, I think.

I read a short note on karma that states there is a 'non aggregate self ' or a self beyond the 5 aggegates to explain the concept of karmic rebirth.

"The Buddha, however, postulates transcendent consciousness or Buddha consciousness beyond the aggregates. He does not limit the analysis to impermanent properties. The non-aggregate being is a Buddha who has achieved detachment from the aggregates... This “individual stream of consciousness” describes a “self” or “soul” beyond the aggregates. When awakened this is a Buddha."

But i don't think this is accurate in the context of Mahayana buddhism. If there were a non-aggregate self, the Buddha would have said so clearly and succinctly, right?

Malcolm wrote:
This is just the Pudgalavadin heresy poking its head up.

Though the aggregates are connected in a series,
the wise understand that nothing transfers.

Is autopoiesis as a theory of cognition sufficiently elaborated to serve as a standard for awareness?

That aside, at this point, yes, machines with that capacity have not been developed. But we are already able to replicate in silico most of the lower-level mechanisms of biological brains, albeit on a much smaller scale. What is often overlooked about artificial neural networks is that as the name suggests, they were abstractions of how we thought biological neural networks function, and the former have done a progressively better and better job of emulating and in some cases surpassing the functionality of the latter. It's therefore quite possible to imagine a machine of sufficient complexity being developed within the next half-century that would meet the standard for awareness.

An old joke in machine learning used to run: what does AI stand for? 'Almost implemented'.  Every time someone said they'd 'solved' an AI problem, someone would argue that that wasn't 'real' AI, it was just an implementation of an algorithm that solved a particular instance of a problem. As the problems being solved become more and more complex, that argument will seem increasingly unpersuasive.

The question then seems to be, do brains, biological or mechanical, provide the necessary mechanisms for self-awareness? Or is there something else required for self-awareness?

After Buddhism was brought to China from India, the initial focus on sutra translation gradually evolved into the eight Chinese schools of Mahayana Buddhism: the Three Treatise (Sanlun), Pure Land, Tian Tai, Consciousness-Only (also known as Yogachara), Huayan, Vinaya, Chan, and the Tantric schools. The late Chan Master Sheng Yen (1930–2009) compared the approaches of the eight schools to modern fields of study, stating: “The approach of the Consciousness-Only school resembles that of science, and the Three Treatise school is akin to philosophy. The approaches of the Huayan and Tian Tai schools parallel literature. The mantra school (Shingon shū) and Pure Land can be considered forms of aesthetics. Meanwhile, Chan embodies the core teachings of the Buddhadharma. Master Taixu [1890–1947] also said, ‘The crux of Chinese Buddhism is Chan,’ where the teaching of any of the other schools can be reduced to the spirit of Chan. As for the disciplines (Vinaya) school, it is the foundation of Buddhism.” (Master Sheng Yen 2007, 128)

Hello, can you please recommend a version of the Madhyāntavibhāga? I'm interested in reading it and there seems to be three versions available: one from the Khenpo Shenga from the Nyingma school, another from Thrangu Rinpoche of the Kagyu Shentong tradition and the last one is a commentary from Sthiramati who Xuanzang lists as one of the ten great masters of the Yogacara and according to some people author of the commentary on the Uttaratantra which I read. The Kagyu one seems to be most recent whereas the Sthiramati is from 1936 so I don't know how accurate the translation will be.

I don't know much about Indo-Tibetan Buddhism, I'm more familiar with Chan and general Mahayana sutras so is there a particular one I should read?

Hello all,

You see, in Patrul Rinpoche's "Nine Considerations and Criteria for Benefiting Beings" says in the 6th point "Consideration of the pros and cons of generosity" the next:
4. Consideration of the pros and cons of giving protection from fear
If bodhisattvas possess the power to protect sentient beings from danger, they should act to do so. But if they do not, they should not act. If you have the power but it would cause harm to yourself, you should not act. Even if your power is small, if it would not harm yourself or others, you should act to protect and defend endangered beings as much as possible.
so i was wondering why mr Patrul Rinpoche gave advice on giving material things and performing actions, but in this very case (underlined text) protection from fear is not to be applyed at our own expenses.

this made me think that maybe i don't understand what "protect from fear" really means.

can anyone send some light on this? i found it very very interesting, but i don't get why the criteria here is different from other activities.

For example, you should NOT run through a gun battle just to save a small dog. This is what it means. In other words, in order to benefit others one needs to protect oneself.

Actually, the idea that the 2nd Amendment meant that everyone had a right to own an individual firearm is really a post-Civil war interpretation by the SCOTUS. Prior to this, the idea that everyone was entitled to gun was highly contested, and the 2nd Amendment was broadly understood to mean that the right to bear arms was for the purpose of mustering state militias, since there was no professional army in the United States until 1791, shortly after the Constitution was ratified. Prior to the civil war, rifles and pistols were very expensive, costing a year's salary, and most people did not own firearms. However, there was also the Bliss decision in Kentucky that argued that the right to bear arms was personal. However, the Arkansas Buzzard decision, known as the Arkansas Doctrine, came down on the side of the militia interpretation. The turning point came after the Civil War over the question of whether freed slaves had the right to bear arms. At the same time, the availability of inexpensive, mass-produced firearms fostered catalogue sales of pistols and rifles during the westward expansion of the US, and advertising campaigns to sell these weapons were widespread. This is really the source of the "gun culture" of the US -- it was manufactured by marketing people.

"The Buddha, however, postulates transcendent consciousness or Buddha consciousness beyond the aggregates. He does not limit the analysis to impermanent properties. The non-aggregate being is a Buddha who has achieved detachment from the aggregates... This “individual stream of consciousness” describes a “self” or “soul” beyond the aggregates. When awakened this is a Buddha."

But i don't think this is accurate in the context of Mahayana buddhism. If there were a non-aggregate self, the Buddha would have said so clearly and succinctly, right?

Also seperating meaning depending on "worldly life" and the dharma reeks a bit of self-importance. We all have jobs to do, the "worldly" and the "holy" one should fullfill them and not dwell so much on the meaning or meaningless of activities, again feels a bit too self-important. But if one needs meaning to let go of relative thinking then say its meaningfull and get on with it, if one needs no meaning to let go of both meaning and non-meaning then say its meaningless and go on with it.

I wonder what would happen if the clear stipulation was that you must have signs of attaining the function of any mantra before you are allowed to give to others.

And that, of course, brings us full circle back to having a teacher who can tell you when you have.

Im not saying that one shouldnt consult their teacher but I think we have a tendency to over-rely on our teachers when it comes to our practice and responsibility for upholding the transmission of the dharma.
If a practitioner receives empowerment, does the practice, and has signs of genuine experience, is asked to give the transmission, then they shouldnt be able to make the decision on whether or not to do so based upon their own relationship with the individual requesting and their willingness to take on the responsibility.

Relying on conventional truth to cultivate is what relying on illusion to cultivate illusion means I believe. Illusion may be used to refer to only deceptive truths in certain traditions but in Chan it covers all conventional truths.

Malcolm wrote:
If the example of an illusion is being used merely to demonstrate arising from causes and conditions, this is a correct usage. If it is being used to negate appearances, it is being used incorrectly.

ItsRaining said:
The dharma when taught and practiced is in the realm of the conventional truths and relies on causes and conditions making it ultimately illusionary.



Malcolm wrote:
If one is using the example of illusion to claim that Dharma paths and practices are not effective or functional, this is a nihilistic interpretation and is incorrect.

ItsRaining said:
Since both practices and the fruit is said to be empty. I think the user you were responding to coming from a Zen POV will refer to to all relative truths as illusion. So there are sayings in Chan like "The Buddha taught all Dharmas to cure all minds - I have not any of those minds, what need is there for the Dharma?"

Malcolm wrote:
The basis, path, and result are all empty. Of what are they empty? nature/inherent existence. This does not render them nonfunctional, as Fuki's use of the illusion example implies.

Moreover, even ultimate truth is merely a conventional truth. There is no ultimate truth per se, apart from correctly apprehending a given thing's absence of true existence. When we see things correctly, we see that they exist without any true existence. For this reason awakening does not arise randomly. Awakening only arises for those people who have correct view, and that correct view is profound dependent origination.

For example, when a magician manufactures the illusion of an elephant, we do not negate the appearance of the elephant, we negate only its functionality to do things an elephant does independently. But the cause and conditions through which that illusory elephant also cannot be negated. If they are, one cannot account for the appearance of the illusory elephant at all. If one declares the appearance of the elephant does not exist, then one is directly contradicting the evidence of one's own sense organs. Only sophists and fools will negate the evidence of their own, healthy sense organs.

ItsRaining said:
I'm not sure what is you mean by "its appearance is not a negandum.", don't appearances get negated in Madhyamaka as non-nonsensical? I remember reading Nagarjuna refuting distinct appearances and shared appearances (arise, stay, change, cease).

Malcolm wrote:
Madhyamaka does not negate appearances, it negates true existence or inherent existence. (It also goes further and negates the four extremes, but that is a technical point not needed here.)

ItsRaining said:
The Sutra of Perfect Enlightenment says this, is that the same as saying perception corresponds to suchness as both existence and non-existence is dispelled?
"Good sons, in the practice of Perfect Enlightenment of the causal stage of the Tathāgata one understands these 'sky-flowers,' thus there is no transmigration, nor body/mind to undergo life-and-death. But they are not caused to be non-existent. It is because they lack original nature. Now, this [prior] awareness is in itself void, like empty space. Yet since this awareness that perceives it to be like empty space is none other than the appearance of sky-flowers, you also cannot say that there is no nature of awareness. Existence and non- existence both being dispelled is called 'according with pure enlightenment.' "
I agree the mind that comprehends the arising from causes + conditions isn't deluded and corresponds to suchness but it doesn't make it substantially existent which is what being illusionary meant in this case.

Malcolm wrote:
As long as we understand examples such as sky flowers, etc., to mean that all phenomena from matter to omniscience do not ultimately exist, then there is no problem, because they have no essence. But if we use such examples to negate phenomena which arise from cause and conditions, we run into the problem that conventional phenomena arise from causes and conditions; sky flowers and so on do not arise because they have no causes.

The only place where use of such metaphors is acceptable is when we are making a case about the ultimate truth of a given thing. Ultimately, inherent existence and self are like sky flowers and so on because they have no cause, therefore, they do not arise, therefore they are utterly unreal, not even conventionally real. But there is a right way to realize this in accordance with suchness and ultimate truth, and a wrong way to realize this, which causes one to negate cause and condition in the relative. Thus, when we correctly observe phenomena, we see that in them there is no inherent existence and no self. The appearance of inherent existence and self is like the appearance of sky flowers, and so on, a complete delusion.

Illusions, mirages, and so on illustrate arising from causes and conditions. Thus, this class of metaphors needs to be distinguished from the class of metaphors involving sky flowers, hair on tortoises, horns on rabbits, and so on, which illustrate phenomena which do not arise from causes and conditions, and which are thus conventionally impossible.

The former set of metaphors indicates how conventional appearances arise in relative through cause and condition.
The latter set of metaphors describes how the imputation of self and natures (which never have any cause or condition) onto any phenomena which arise through cause and condition is utterly mistaken, even conventionally.

To put it most simple: when we see the example of illusion, we are seeing an example of arising from cause and conditions. When we see the example of a sky flower, we are seeing an example of the negation of self and nature.

Malcolm wrote:
Samsara is the experience of suffering caused by karma that is motivated by affliction, that's all. When all those afflictions cease entirely due to insight, one becomes one of three kinds of buddhas: arhat, pratyekabuddhas, or samyaksambuddha, At that point, one is completely freed of birth, and that is the sole point of awakening. The innate grasping at a truly-existing self is the root of the three poisons. That innate grasping at a truly-existing self is a very subtle delusion. But it is the basic delusion that informs all of our cognitive choices and discriminations. The only thing that has meaning is the correct recognition of this deluded, innate grasping at a truly-existing self so that this delusion can be extirpated from one's continuum. We are not even projecting something on to another thing, such as imputing a self upon the aggregates. The innate grasping at a truly-existing self needs no object of imputation to be imputed. It is naturally imputed as the mere thought, 'me' or 'I.'

It is using illusion to remove illusion.

Malcolm wrote:
The difference between conventional truth and false or deceptive relative truth is that the former is strictly common perception, whereas the latter also includes hallucinations, and other deluded states which are nonfunctional.

The point of this is that without resorting to conventional truth, one cannot understand and then realize ultimate truth, and therefore, nirvana is impossible.

The point of the illusion example is that an illusion, a deceptive relative truth, is understood to arises from causes and conditions, a veridical relative truth. And further, since this illusion arises from causes and conditions, it is natureless and lacks true existence, but its appearance is not a negandum.

The mind that apprehends the arising of phenomena from causes and conditions cannot be a deluded mind in anyway, since this perception corresponds with suchness. Whereas, the mind that apprehends an illusion can be deluded if it misapprehends the source of the illusion as something other than causes and conditions, i.e. permanent or annihilated.

Thus, illusion cannot be used to remove illusion since illusions are part of relative deceptive truth, rather than conventional truth.

Upon further reflection, though, it is clear to me he was right. Many Buddhist types who reject "God" really just reject that which is easily rejected: the crudely anthropomorphized tribal deity. But they continue to hold tightly to a less-defined spiritual "oneness" or "source" of reality, and to view the goal of practice through the lens of atonement, "returning to" something, or "becoming one with" something. Even the choice often made to capitalize "One Mind" and "True Self" perhaps speaks to this. It's a factor worth acknowledging when discussing dharma in these parts.

There is a controversy here. Tsongkhapa maintains that it is very important to identify what he terms the subtle object of negation, inherent existence, because the coarse object of negation, existence, is an over-negation.


In other words, the cup is designated dependent on its parts. If you negate the existence of the cup, you are contradicting your own perception of the cup. If you negate only the cup's inherent existence however, you can maintain the conventional value of the cup that you perceive, but by understanding its lack of inherent existence, you can also acknowledge the cup is something which arises from conditions, since nothing that arises from conditions can be held to inherently exist—arising from conditions is simply a convention.

It is pretty clear that Indian Mahāyāna Buddhists regarded arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and buddhas as equivalent with respect to liberation.

Since the three realms are mere concepts,

Malcolm wrote:
The Tien Tai school's use of the term ekayāna has come to dominate discourse around it, since ekayāna is such a central term in their system. The unfortunate consequence of this is that the way the term is used by Buddhist scholars in Buddhism's native home, India, has been somewhat eclipsed. No one in India seems ever to have thought to make the term a centerpiece of their hermeneutics based on a historiographical idea of the three turnings (or five periods), just as the three turnings themselves are virtually ignored by Indian scholars, but are important to Tibetan scholars.

From the point of view of text critical methodology, there are a couple of points to bear in mind. Taking Chinese translations of Mahāyāna Sūtras as an approximate gauge of the date of their initial composition, there are no sūtras that use the terminology of the three kāyas that can be dated prior to Maitreyanatha ((ca. 270-350 CE). Thus, trying to use the term sambhogakāya with respect to sūtras earlier than Maitreyanath is anachronistic. These sūtras describe the kāyas of the buddha solely as rūpakāya and dharmakāya. The earliest depictions of the sambhogakāya are in Maitreyanatha's texts, where "sambhogakāya" principally refers to the 32 signs and 80 marks. Moreover, there are no sūtras that I can find where the two terms, rūpakāya and sambhogakāya, can be found together.

It seems the earliest sūtra to fully embrace the terminology of three kāyas is the proto-tantric Suvarnaprabhasa Sūtra, first translated into Chinese by Dharmakṣema between 1414-421. (The question of why Maitryeanātha found it useful or necessary to elaborate the concept of the sambhogakāya, and possible influences is an interesting question, but there is no room for it here.)

Given this, we come across an important distinction: any sūtras which use the terminology of three kāyas were composed after Maitreyanātha's dates, that is, they must have been composed after 275-350 CE.

There is no discussion of ekayāna in Indian treatises that can be found in the Tibetan canon which can be dated earlier than Maitreyanatha as well (I have no idea about what can be gleaned from the Chinese canon). Given the fact that there is no distance between what Vasubandhu reports about ekayāna and Candrakīrti, it is clear that for Indian paṇḍitas, Maitreyanatha, Asanga, and Vasubandhu pretty much set the tone for how ekayāna, as well as the rest of Indian Buddhology, was to be discussed from then on. Given that this is the case, and given that the ekayāna is pretty much described as being the identical liberation of arhats, pratyekabuddhas, and buddhas in both Yogacāra and post 6th century Madhyamaka sources, it is not surprising then that Tibetan scholars themselves devoted virtually no attention to the concept.

Why would any Mahayana practitioner ignore Amitabha's Pure Land?

Malcolm wrote:
I don't think that Nichiren was telling people to ignore Sukhavati. His axe to grind was against Honen, the founder of the Jodo-shu sect (Honen acknowledges he founded a new school of Buddhism in his seminal Senchakushū ), who he believed was leading people away from the Dharma with an undue emphasis on Nembutsu, reciting the name of Amitabha Buddha, Namo Amida Butsu.

A significant factor in his conviction about this was his belief that people in Japan had forgotten about Śākyamuni Buddha (of course they hadn't, but that is a different story), and thus he advocated for the elimination of Pure Land Buddism, which he considered a "one-sided teaching" as it was being practiced by Honen and his disciples.

NIchiren tied some of his polemics to his belief that the practice of Pure Land Buddhism has earlier caused the suppression of Buddhism by the Taoist Emperor Wuzong (814-846) during the Tang Dynasty in China, and later on, the death in 1221 of the cloistered Japanese emperor Go-toba after he led an unsuccessful rebellion against the Kamakura Shogunate and was exiled.

The interesting thing about this is that Go-toba actually banned Honen's Pure Land school, ordering the execution of some its adherents and the banishment of Honen. There was eventually a rapprochement, where Honen signed a pledge to reign in some of his more radical students. Despite all of this, clearly Nichiren held Honen's teaching and people response to it as being responsible for the death of Go-toba.

Buddhism rejects eternalism regarding all compound things, but what about the flow of karma, cause and effect ever moving myriad things? Even after kalpas upon kalpas it would seem that it's posited that the process of being and non-being will continue indefinitely, thus creating an eternal system of flux.

Malcolm wrote:
Since the past is not established, since it has perished, and the future is not established, since it has yet to come to be, the present cannot be established either. Therefore, dependent origination is not an eternal process because no processes can be established, other than as conventions.

Further, dependent origination is about the afflicted processes that drive samsara, affliction, action, and suffering. When affliction is removed, action has no cause; and when action has no cause, the result, suffering cannot be produced. From this perspective too, dependent origination cannot be seen as eternal, since when one attains realization, one becomes free from that process entirely.

With respect to Maitreya's or any another tenth stage bodhisattvas omniscience, the Buddha had this to say about it in the Perfection of Wisdom in 18,000 Lines:

If it is asked how a bodhisattva mahāsattva abiding on the tenth stage is called a "tathāgata," because such a bodhisattva mahāsattva has throughly completed the ten perfections, thoroughly completed the eighteen unshared buddhadharmas up to the omniscient knowledge of aspects, has totally relinquished traces, connections, and afflictions, and totally completed all buddhadharmas, Subhuti, a bodhisattva mahāsattva abiding on the tenth stage is called "tathāgata."

Thus, your idea that Maitreya's comment in that passage shows some limit to his knowledge is completely refuted.

I'd like to go back to Qq's assertions.  There are two.

1. the three yanas are not real paths in themselves, but are instead upaya.  Means to an end.  Hold that thought.

2.  in themselves, they do not lead to annuttarasamyaksambodhi.

OK, if 1 is true, and I think it is, then you have to consider what the objective of that upaya may be.  I think they are means to the end of bringing  beings to the Mahayana, which does lead to annuttarasamyaksambodhi.  This means the purpose and function of the three yanas is to lead beings to annuttarasamyaksambodhi.

To my mind, as of this moment, 2 must be false if 1 is true.  All three lead to Mahayana and therefore to annuttarasamyaksambodhi.  There's one Dharma path but different maps and landmarks, if that analogy makes sense.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding Qq's post and Malcolm's objection to it.

If I'm mistaken, I invite the gallery to set me right.

Queequeg said:
The intervening cause that reconciles 1 and 2 is the Buddha delivering the sobering message - "Everything I've taught you is upaya. Here is what's really going on." The rich man's son was always the rich man's son, but he thought he was something else. The rich man treated him as a servant, but that was only because the son thought that was all he was. The father contrived the whole charade for the son's benefit, but there was one reality all along, and in the father's mind, one end. The son on the other hand is conducting himself within the paradigm of a servant until the father declares, "It was all a put on!" That charade was never going to lead to the son realizing his real identity. Sooner or later, the father had to pierce the fiction and reveal the truth. Once the son knows who he really is, the servant paradigm is shattered. Same thing - once the Buddha tells the sravaka, "That whole Hinayana was a story I told you because you think so little of yourself the only thing that would satisfy you was to annihilate desire, etc." How could Sariputra go back to the sravaka path once he hears he's destined for Buddhahood, and always was? The Phantom City has been dispelled, and Sariputra finds himself back on the trail. All he can do is say, with realization casting his entire sravaka endeavor in a new light, "Ohhhhh..... that's what that was...."

Malcolm wrote:
In his commentary on the Lankāvatara Sūtra, Vasubandhu opines:

To the immature, three vehicles, one vehicle, and no vehicle are taught; but to the āryas, the truth of the three vehicles is taught as nondual dharmatā.

On the other hand, Asvabhāva writes in his Extensive Commentary on the Ornament of Mahāyāna Sūtras:
Since it is culmination of all vehicles, it is called Mahāyāna; since there is no other special vehicle beyond that, it is called Ekayāna.

So from this point of view, Ekayāna is the bodhisattva path of perfections, and nothing else.

On the Madhyamaka team, the only thing Vimuktisena writes in his massive commentary on the Abhisamayālaṃkāra:

Since dharmatā is undifferentiated, all paths are the Ekayāna.

All Buddhist discipline takes these ten natural principles based on our body, voice, and mind as the foundation for all vows, and so on. When we add bodhicitta on top of this, we arrive at the Mahāyāna path. This is why all Mahāyāna practice, including Dzogchen, takes the motivation to attain buddhahood for all sentient beings as the basis for the path.

Nonharming -- bodhicitta -- insight. These three are the essence of Mahāyāna ethics.

I couldn’t possibly disagree with any of that, as I think it’s perfectly true.

Or would that be a misunderstanding?

Malcolm wrote:
As Haribhadra pointed out, the path, from beginning to end, is an illusion, like anything else produced from conditions, such as mirages, optical illusions, and so on. The appearances that we see have no essence when they appear, and if they are sought out, they are only found with respect to how solid our own clinging to our own sense of self is. In other words, the more real we imagine our personal self to be, the more real we imagine phenomena to be. And when we have understood that our personal self really is just a designation upon shifting conditions, which are composed of still more shifting conditions, we simultaneously can understand that about all other appearances, and sever our clinging. In the meantime, we observe conventions and do not assume these illusory conditions don't have rules and apparent consequences. But it isn't fixed or real in any meaningful, ontological, way.

Queequeg said:
Here is the way Ekayana is understood in East Asian Lotus Traditions - namely Tiantai, Tendai, Nichiren.

There is one vehicle - the Buddhayana. In response to the needs of the various beings, the Buddha, employing upaya, teaches the Sravakayana, Pratyekabuddhayana, and Bodhisattvayana. The Sravakayana is characterized by the teaching of the Four Noble Truths, Eightfold Path, etc. what we usually associate with Hinayana. The Pratyekabuddhayana is characterized by wisdom of pratityasamutpada, particularly through the teaching of the 12 linked chain of causation. The Bodhisattvayana is characterized by the teaching on the Six Paramita and the gradual path of 3 eons. None of these is a real path; all three of these are upaya. They, in themselves, do not lead to annuttarasamyaksambodhi. Only the Buddhayana leads to annuttarasamyaksambodhi. These three vehicles lead along the path, but only incompletely. And actually, the Buddhayana encompasses these teachings, without any caveat, but these teachings do not encompass the Buddhayana. Neither do these teachings necessarily encompass each other. For instance, in some interpretations of the Bodhisattvayana, Sravaka, Pratyekabuddha, and Icchantika are precluded from ever attaining Buddhahood. Hence, that form of the Bodhisattvayana is called a Separate or Distinct teaching. All paths eventually lead to the pure Buddhayana, meaning, at some point, beings are told that the path they tread is upaya and that what they have always already been treading was the Buddhayana. That the three are provisional, and only the Buddhayana is real. This is the teaching called the Lotus. It is taught from time time, but not all the time.

In the third chapter of the Lotus Sutra, the Buddha tells the famous parable of the burning house. In short, a father finds his children obliviously playing in a burning house. He tries to get them out by pointing out the danger, but they don't listen. He contrives to tell them that there are goat, deer and ox carts outside, and if they would only come outside he would give each their own cart. The children come running out, but there are no carts. The father is happy because his children are safe, but now the children are demanding the carts. The father is then so happy he gives all the children great ox carts far beyond anything they expected and they ride off into the sunset.

The three carts that are promised are the sravakayana, pratyekabuddhayana, and bodhisattvayana. They don't actually exist. But, if people undertake these paths, they will be delivered from the burning house. Once they're out, the Buddha gives them the Buddhayana which is far beyond what they could have hoped for.

“O Śāriputra! You should know that the buddhas, with the power of skillful means, teach the single buddha vehicle, dividing and teaching it as three.”

Several other parables convey similar messages - for instance the parable of the phantom city.

The real controversy is about whether the Bodhisattvayana and the Buddhayana are actually the same. Both are referred to as Mahayana. However, in what is called the Honmon, or original gate teachings, meaning the second half of the Lotus Sutra, there comes a point when the assembly of bodhisattvas that includes Maitreya, Manjusri, Avalokitesvara, etc. etc., Bodhisattvas that are on the path of the six paramita, are stumped by a myriad of bodhisattvas who erupt out of the ground and which the Buddha identifies as his disciples since his enlightenment. Maitreya and the assembly cannot understand this, describing it like a young man introducing an old man as his son. This indicates that the bodhisattva who are the foremost in the assembly actually are limited. These bodhisattvas until that point still believe that Shakyamuni first attained enlightenment in Gaya.

This is where the bodhisattvayana is demonstrated to be an incomplete path - even Maitreya who is supposed to be the next Buddha doesn't realize that the path he treads is so limited.

In the next Chapter, the Buddha explains his life span which is understood to be eternal, and that all beings, are on this Buddhayana whether they realize it or not, all destined for Buddhahood. The Bodhisattvas don't even know the full scope of this path, let alone sravaka or pratyekabuddha.

I am sure there will be disagreement and critique, moaning about "This is not how the Indians understand it!"

All well and good. There really is nothing to argue about. This is it. This is fact. This is what Ekayana and the Three Vehicles means in East Asian Lotus discourse. Whatever you think about it is opinion.

So that part of your narrative, friend is inconsistent.  And save me the sermon about "The Buddha for this time and place." A nirmanak̄ya is a nirmanakāya is a nirmanakāya — they are either omniscient about the three times and everything in it, or they are not. Also, one can easily discover that Mañjuśrī attained full buddhahood countless eons ago, so claiming that he or any other bodhisattva belonging to the eight close sons, or even of the tenth bhumi were under the impression than Śākyamuni Buddha first attained buddhahood at Bodhgaya is totally ridiculous. It just means you ignore everything every other Mahāyāna sūtra has to say.

The problem is that conditioned entities are in spacetime. If spacetime were unconditioned, it could not contain conditioned entities because any relationship between a conditioned entity and an unconditioned entity is impossible.

With respect to Buddhist values -- they are based on "natural" law, i.e. that the ten nonvirtues contribute in general to overall misery and the ten virtues contribute to overall happiness. All Buddhist discipline takes these ten natural principles based on our body, voice, and mind as the foundation for all vows, and so on. When we add bodhicitta on top of this, we arrive at the Mahāyāna path. This is why all Mahāyāna practice, including Dzogchen, takes the motivation to attain buddhahood for all sentient beings as the basis for the path.

Nonharming -- bodhicitta -- insight. These three are the essence of Mahāyāna ethics.

Is it common for lamas to receive pure visions as part of their three year retreat, or through their practice in general?
Are these visions sought, or do they just arise?
How are they differentiate from a very strong imaginary experience?

You need to be a reancarnation of someone who has had the very rare privilege of having been personally chosen by Padmasambhava to receive the transmissions of said treasures.
These are some of his disciples. When the time comes for these treasures to be revealed the disciple should enter a period of retreat where he meets Padmasambhava himself in a vission or a dream and where past memories of empowerments and details about the terma to be revealed are awakened.

Guifeng Zongmi on Confucianism and Daoism:

"The main thrust of the non-Buddhist teachings, however, is to establish the conduct for humanity, not to inquire into its ultimate origin. The myriad things discussed in the two teachings are limited to the phenomenal world. Although they point to the great Dao as the root, they do not completely explain agreeability and adversity, arising and ceasing, purity and defilement, or causes and conditions. Consequently, those who practice these teachings are not aware that the doctrines are provisional and cling to them as perfect teachings."
(Treatise on the Origin of Humanity, in Three Short Treatises, BDK ed, p 149)

Dogen wrote:

"no student of Kongzi and Laozi has ever fathomed the Buddha-Dharma. People today of the great kingdom of Song mostly uphold the principle of agreement between Kongzi and Laozi and the Buddha’s truth. It is the gravest of wrong views"
"Kongzi, Laozi, Zhuangzi, Huizi, and suchlike are just common people. They could not reach the level of even a srotāpanna of the Small Vehicle; how much less could they reach the level of the second [effect] or the third [effect] or an arhat of the fourth [effect]? That students, however, out of ignorance, put them on a par with the buddhas, is “in the midst of delusion, deepening delusion.” Kongzi and Laozi are not only ignorant of the three times and ignorant of the many kalpas; they are not able to know one instant of mindfulness and not able to know one moment of the mind. They do not bear comparison even with the gods of the sun and the moon and they cannot equal the four great kings and the hosts of gods. Whether in the secular sphere or beyond the secular sphere, [seen] in comparison with the World-honored One, they are straying in delusion."

Trump just passed an insane tax cut bill.  He's throwing money at the already rich.  That's why he's tolerated.  Mitt Romney couldn't do it,  but Trump could squeak into office and get this done for reasons we don't need to get into but have everything to do with idiot baby boomers.

Handing already rich people a big ol' wad of capital, among other things, spurs inflation.  Fears of inflation open onto bearish markets.  And here we are.

Russia's economy is the same size as Italy's. So please, dispense with the ridiculous exaggerations about how our economic, military, and political place in the world is so precarious. We, along with Western Europe are the wealthiest, most technically advanced countries in the world.

OK.  I haven't studied Yogacara in any detail at all, so I wouldn't know.

I should have made my point differently.  I don't know of any contemporary school of Mahayana that would claim that practitioners of sravakayana, even those who attain the goal of arhatship, do not eventually wind up practicing Mahayana and then attaining Buddhahood.  Are there any such schools today?

jake said:
Hi DGA,

The way you've phrased the paragraph above has triggered a question. Is your understanding of Ekayana that the other two vehicles lead to the Mahayana and then Anuttarasamyaksambodhi? Or that all three vehicles lead, eventually, to Anuttarasamyaksambodhi? Sorry if this is 'off topic' in the thread, recognizing of course the broad scope of this thread.

DGA said:
Good one.  My comments so far in this thread don't account for pratyekabuddhas.  I've never met one so I can't say first hand.  In fact, I'm just parroting what little I know of the Mahayana party line.  Here's my best shot at that question.

I think you have to practice Mahayana (which is the same as Ekayana) in order to become a Samyaksambuddha.  Which means that pratyekabuddhas don't attain anuttarasamyaksambodhi, because they haven't practiced Mahayana.  Or is it possible for a pratyekabuddha to practice Mahayana?   I don't know.

I think all sentient beings have Buddhahood available to them, and that the different schemes of different vehicles are little more than temporarily useful fictions or taxonomies.

I invite anyone with the patience to correct any mistakes I've made to do so.

Then Gelugpas get mad and claim we are getting hung up on rhetoric. Moreover, there are more than just a few Gelugpas who double down on the rhetoric, and I see the same thing happening among Nichirenistas.

In your tradition, how would you describe this forth jeweled cart, the one pulled by a great white ox? Sorry to say, I remain rather ignorant of the specifics of the Tibetan traditions. (I also realize there are differing perspectives on what constitutes ekayana in Japanese traditions...)

jake

Malcolm wrote:
There is no "fourth" cart. There is only one cart, Mahāyāna, the practice of the six perfections which takes three incalculable eons. The jeweled cart drawn by the white elephant (not ox) is the result of Mahāyāna practice, buddhahood.

For example, the Lanka states:

"There are no other vehicles,
I teach only one vehicle;
but in order to guide the immature,
I explain different vehicles.

Candrakīrti observes:

"It is said ''There are persons for one vehicle and three,' but ultimately, there is only one vehicle. The teaching of Śrāvakayāna, Pratyekabuddhayāna and Mahāyāna is for the purpose of introducing sentient beings."

He then clarifies what this means for him:

Because there are no divisions in the dharmadhātu, those [three] were explained for introducing [sentient beings]. Ārya Nāgārjuna states:

Because there are no divisions in the dharmadhātu, 
there are no divisions in vehicles;
the teaching of three vehicles
is for introducing sentient beings.

In that case, since the dharmadhātu is uniform, and because śrāvakas and so on do not differentiate the dharmadhātu, the vehicle is only one. Since there is traversing, there is a so-called vehicle, and because the absence of an entity of self of śrāvakas and so one are the same, there is one vehicle. Since this is traversed, it is a vehicle. Since they are equivalent in liberation, there is one vehicle."

Candra then goes on to point out that Yogacārins like Maitreyanatha regard the one vehicle teaching as interpretable and not definitive. He summarizes his statement however by stating, " As such, the character of the Mahāyāna is established as the Ekayāna. " In other words, Candra defines the one vehicle from the standpoint of reality, the dharmadhātu, and since reality is one, the means of realizing it must all be the same.

In other words, for Madhyamaka, Mahāyāna is the Ekayāna, there is no Ekayāna apart from Mahāyāna. This is basically how the Ekayāna is understood in Tibet as well, since we are all Madhyamaka here, of the Prasaṅga variety, apart from some people that follow gzhan stong.

Get in slow. Like Malcolm touched on, start with funds, and as you get a feel for what's going on, focus on industries that you can relate to, and then you can start placing specialized bets.

Actually, investing is a great dharma practice in certain respects. You need to cultivate detachment and equanimity. Attachments can get you killed.

Take a long view, and understand that over a long period of time, the market typically averages out to a 10-11 percent return, subtract inflation, and you have your real return (hence the panic over inflation in the market for the past couple of trading days). Stocks are not for most people. This is why Buffet always tells people to put their money in funds that track the major indexes. Right now, a 50/50 or 60/40 split between domestic and foreign equities is a good way to go, keep 15 percent in bonds, and 5 percent in cash. Also, Fidelity and Vanguard are selling total portfolios where one can simply invest in one fund according to one's stomach for risk, which is balanced accordingly.

Then Gelugpas get mad and claim we are getting hung up on rhetoric. Moreover, there are more than just a few Gelugpas who double down on the rhetoric, and I see the same thing happening among Nichirenistas.

This is absolutely correct, but there is a right way to arrive at this view of no view, and a wrong way.

The right way is to analyze phenomena and find that there are no phenomena which stand up to analysis. The wrong way is to take this "no view" as a statement of dogma and start barking it at everything you see.

Now, in the West we have many people training in Zen who do not even know the rudiments of Buddhadharma. This was not the case in China and Japan, where Zen/Chan training was engaged in by people who were well trained in Sūtra, Abhidharma, and so on.

So, it is not surprising in the least that in Zen circles there are people who are unable to distinguish at all what is Buddhadharma and why it is truly unique in the world. The same thing is true of Vipassana.

When we study Dharma in a proper way, we will abandon the notion that there is liberation for those outside of the Dharma.

The pundits say it is because the jobs market is looking good, the economy is doing well, so the stock investors fear interest rates will be going up several times this year. That just makes me glad not to be part of that group, that wishes ill for the common workers, so that the Fed will keep interest rates low. Of course, I am sure there are some investors who don't think like that, but that was the general consensus among the pundits.

Malcolm wrote:
It is a buying opportunity. The world economy is growing. Fundamentals of the economy are great.

The market dropped because if interest rates rise, money becomes more expensive, and this affects returns on investments made with borrowed money. At a micro level this is nothing, but at the macro level, mutual fund level, this gets very expensive very quickly.

This will cause some investors to move their money into bonds, since yields are going to rise. Of course, let's hope the new Fed chair keeps his head and is super cautious about raising the Fed rates.

This is not a dis on workers, but there is some risk of inflation, because we are at nearly "full" employment. If borrowing money becomes expensive, this makes commercial paper more expensive, and this can have an adverse affect on jobs and growth.

Seems 'dzogchenpa' can be used in both contexts. Both dictionaries define it as 'practitioners of dzogchen' and teachers have used it in this way.

krodha said:
The main point is again, that "Dzogchen" is the living and experiential dimension of equipoise. Those who have known Dzogchen are awakened individuals.

Even within the scope of the buddhadharma, there are "practitioners of the buddhadharma" and then there are those who have awakened, given the title "ārya." In the same way only those who have awakened to their nature have come to know "Dzogchen," and those who have not yet awakened cannot be said to know the meaning of "dzogchen."

Nevertheless they are practicing to create circumstances that are conducive to awakening. Those who have awakened and have lapsed back into their relative condition are also creating conducive circumstances to continually re-visit said equipoise, as that is the entire point.

Just as in the buddhadharma the distinction of an ārya is made, I feel it is appropriate to make the distinction we are discussing. The āryas of the world have tasted chocolate so to speak, they have an experiential, working knowledge of that taste. Those who have not tasted chocolate do not possess that knowledge.

This all started because I said "as an alleged atiyogin, you know X to be the case." You then asked what I meant by "alleged" and this is what I mean, as someone who has allegedly tasted chocolate, you possess an experiential knowledge of that taste. Likewise a yogin of ati, or a "Dzogchenpa" is someone who, if they aren't knowing it constantly, has at least awakened to know "Dzogchen."

So my speech differs when I know someone better and have established a deeper connection. Blindly expounding the dharma to anyone who appears can also be a disservice to the dharma. We all differ in our approach, when a practisioner has seen through the cause and can drop self-grasping the gateway into Ch'an will naturally open. Again I am not a teacher and ofcourse right understanding is vital it is not always the time and place for me to adress it, it might be different for you. No opposition there, what is kind or not kind cannot be predicted, it is wisdom which gives compassion its direction, for me always adressing everyone's misconception can be like releasing a bird with one broken wing, which is then also my resposibility if it plummets to the ground. So when it doesn't come naturally I maintain silence. But again I wish your guidance and practise or anyone's will be of service to all sentient beings.

My attitude is that Buddhadharma is very precise. It is easy to measure what is in accordance with Buddhadharma and what is not. This is a forum for discussing that. Therefore, if someone offers a view that absolutely contradicts Buddhadharma, it is quite permissible, and even desirable, for that contradiction to be pointed out. I generally find that in the end people appreciate being corrected, even if in the beginning they are a little offended.

Perhaps you are of service to motivate him but putting in "shoulds" usually don't. It's no critique to you I value your assistence in the dharma but it's not my style of speech so I won't discuss that point. If you would adress my understanding of the dharma I would engage but I never talk about the understanding or non-understanding of others.

There are remnants of this in Tibetan culture in the form of rgyal po spirits -- almost every Tibetan family has something like this.

Fear-as-fear is the feeling of not wanting to be afraid. In that case there is a thing, 'fear,' a place, 'here and now,' a person, 'me,' and 'I' want it to go away from 'here' in the immediate future, where that very same 'I' will soon be, so that I can go back to the way I was before I was afraid.  Without a construing a 'here' and 'me,' and so on, what remains?  When you know fear intimately, without conceptual elaboration, it is not-fear.

The Bodhisattva of Fear (you) awakens fear (you) through the dharma gate of fear (you).
You (fear) awaken you (fear) through the dharma gate of you (fear).

Even if they claim to be practicing tregcho and so on, how do I know what they are doing? One can claim to be practicing tregcho yet merely be sitting, distracted, in something that merely resembles samatha. Similarly, one can claim to be practicing thogal, yet just be sitting there, completely distracted, enjoying a light show. There is no way to tell who is applying these views accurately.

That being the case, are the individuals in question practicing Dzogchen? Outwardly it may appear that way. Inwardly though, where it truly matters, I cannot say. For all I know they may be just like someone dressed up in a police officer costume, outwardly appearing as such, yet in actuality not so.

The kinds of foreign policies we pursued in the 1950's and 1960's were not economically feasible.

There is only one way to create democratic countries: step one, lift them up economically; step two; encourage them to develop democratic institutions; step three, encourage them to liberalize their economies.

Neither China nor Russia have liberal economies, and in the end, this is what will bring about their downfall.

He has disowned the economic and political stability the US afforded the world (despite a sometimes checkered foreign policy) and has actively aided and abetted the forces of illiberalism to rise to the forefront. But part of that stability was assured because the Soviets and the Chinese had closed economies, and the US dominated the world in trade. With opening of China and the downfall of the Soviet Union, globalization has had the predictable effect of transitioning manufacturing jobs to cheaper labor markets without providing many Americans with jobs in their place. But the ridiculous rhetoric of the Trump administration has been neatly refuted by Dave Chapelle, who pointed out we don't want jobs "to come back" from China because we don't want $9,000 Iphones and $1000 NIkes.

You may be familiar with the proposal made within the Trump administration for a "bloody nose" strategy viz. North Korea.  The idea is for US forces to make limited military strikes on North Korean targets with the intention of weakening and embarrassing the Kim regime, but in such a way as to somehow avoid a reprisal.  That's impossible, by the way.  More on that below.

More urgently, consider the implicit motivation for such an action:
White House National Security Council senior director for Asian affairs Matthew Pottinger reportedly said in a recent closed-door meeting with US experts on Korean Peninsula issues that a limited strike on the North might help in the midterm elections.

When doing serkhyem in the evening, one also needs to have cups set out for the participants so they all have a little wine at the end. If doing intense Ngaggong or something, you need to take breaks, and during breaks, one has a drink -- this is the mthong brgyud, the seeing lineage.

I personally think that democracy based on liberal economics is the way to go, but lets not kid ourselves into thinking that the US is some paragon of virtue. It really isn't.

Yes, we need police and an army, or course, and yes, like any country, the US has a right to defend itself. The Buddha said:

This, dear son, that you, leaning on the Dhamma, honoring, respecting and revering it, doing homage to it, hallowing it, being yourself a Dhamma-banner, a Dhamma-signal, having the Dhamma as your master, should provide the right watch, ward and protection for your own folk, for the army, for the nobles, for vassals and brahmans and householders, for town and country dwellers, for the religious world and for beasts and birds.

The Buddha observed that if a country is in the side of virtue, any attack against it will be https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html:

5. And the Blessed One addressed the brahman Vassakara in these words: "Once, brahman, I dwelt at Vesali, at the Sarandada shrine, and there it was that I taught the Vajjis these seven conditions leading to (a nation's) welfare. [5] So long, brahman, as these endure among the Vajjis, and the Vajjis are known for it, their growth is to be expected, not their decline."

Thereupon the brahman Vassakara spoke thus to the Blessed One: "If the Vajjis, Venerable Gotama, were endowed with only one or another of these conditions leading to welfare, their growth would have to be expected, not their decline. What then of all the seven? No harm, indeed, can be done to the Vajjis in battle by Magadha's king, Ajatasattu, except through treachery or discord. Well, then, Venerable Gotama, we will take our leave, for we have much to perform, much work to do."

"Do as now seems fit to you, brahman." And the brahman Vassakara, the chief minister of Magadha, approving of the Blessed One's words and delighted by them, rose from his seat and departed.


Victory is suffering:

Victory breeds hatred,
The defeated live in pain.
Happily the peaceful live,
Giving up victory and defeat.

Dhp. v. 201


The Buddha in fact recommends social welfare, unlike the present policies of this adminstration:


But perchance his majesty might think: "I'll soon put a stop to these scoundrels' game by degradation and banishment and fines and bonds and death." But their license cannot be satisfactorily put a stop to so. The remnant left unpunished would still go on harassing the realm. Now there is one method to adopt to put a thorough end to this disorder. Whosoever there be in the king's realm who devote themselves to keeping cattle and the farm, to them let his majesty give food and seed corn. Whosoever there be in the king's realm who devote themselves to trade, to them let his majesty give capital. Whosoever there be in the king's realm who devote themselves to government service, to them let his majesty give wages and food. Then those men, following each his own business, will no longer harass the realm; the king's revenue will go up; the country will be quiet and at peace; and the populace pleased with one another and happy, dancing their children in their arms, will dwell with open doors.


In other words, Roosevelt's New Deal, Johnson's Great Society, Obama's Quantitative Easing policies and Obamacare are precisely the kind of policies the Buddha recommends for a peaceful society.

It is the neglect of the poor that Buddha describes as the downfall of society:

Thus from goods not being bestowed on the destitute, poverty... stealing... violence... murder... lying... evil-speaking... immorality grew rife.
Theft and killing lead to false speech, jealousy, adultery, incest and perverted lust...

Are you saying that the Lotus Sutra contradicts, say, Chapter Thirteen of the Guhyagarbha tantra? I had always thought they were compatible if interpreted in some kind of subtle way (i.e. the sravakayana and pratyekabuddhayanas necessarily funneling into the bodhisattvayana).

Malcolm wrote:
As you know, the Guhygarbha's statment, "Incorrect realization, partial realization, and not realizing perfectly," refers respectively to nonbuddhists, śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, and those who practice the common Mahāyāna.

However, in the Indian treatises, "ekayāna" means different things. For example, in the Lankāvatāra, ekayāna does not include all the other vehicles. "The One Vehicle" refers to Mahāyāna only because it has not been obtained in the past by others. It is stated that it is because of the karmic traces and knowledge obscuration śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have that the Buddha teaches three vehicles, and that the teaching of one vehicle is actually only for Mahāyānis. Given that the Lanka was set down quite some time later than the Saddharmapundarika, we can understand this as a response to it. Likewise, the Nirvana responds to the prediction of all sentient beings as capable of attaining Buddhahood in Saddharmapundarika with the notion of the icchantika, while at the same time promoting tathāgatagarbha, as contradictory as that may seem.

I agree, but again practise in other paths are not excluded from seeing DO and I've personally known an advaita teacher who taught this, sure it might be the exception to the rule, but just our other talk (don't know/non-dwelling/net neti) we seem to agree about many points but also speak past each other. DO teachings might appear in buddhadharma but its not an exclusive to buddhadharma since there is no division in reality, so its nonsensical to say that outside of buddhadharma ppl cant awaken or are never grounded in DO, you might have not met them but ok. DO has no trademark it might be recorded as we know in Buddhism but depended origination is realized in daily life not by effort of the intellect. Again I agree it is an exception to the "rule" but the claim that there are no realized ppl outside of buddhadharma I could not make, Im sure I can find ancient books where the earth was still flat, or better that it couldnt possibly ever be round.

Malcolm wrote:
There is no teaching of dependent origination outside Buddhadharma. It is the Buddha's unique teaching, and does not exist in other traditons, and is in fact explicitly rejected in the source texts of Advaita and so on, fiercely rejected by Shankaracarya, etc.

I really cannot know what this person you refer to taught. But if they taught there was some truly existent ultimate reality then they were not teaching from the view point of dependent origination. No one who accepts and teaches dependent origination accepts there is such a reality.

The Samkhya teachings, which are the underlying structure for Hindu teachings in general, have something which might seem to be dependent origination, but it isn't.

Even if that is so Malcolm (I'm not asserting or denying historical accuracy at all) then what is recorded is clearly words depended on condition and circumstances of the time when the Buddha was alive, afterall the dharma is fluid, not fixed. I also know realized Buddhist masters today who will not say that it is not possible that there are realized ppl "outside" of Buddhadharma which I cannot ignore just because it is recorded in ancient texts. But really for me it doesnt matter if it is recorded in sutras whether there are realized ppl outside of buddhadharma or not, but I wont say its impossible only because it says so according to a sutra. But again it makes no difference to me, it doesnt affect practise. So I'm not in negation to what you claim, I also wouldnt assert it.

I made my reply to No Mind according to observed patterns I witnessed on the interweb, I rejoice in anyone who seeks to realize original nature, I'm just "afraid" his interest in Buddhism gets distracted from the usual trolling of ppl of demotivating him due to blindly locking him up in a mental "Hindu" picture. I hope I'm wrong.

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddha was pretty clear what Dharma and Discipline would contain awakened people, a Dharma and Discipline that contained the eightfold path. That path starts from right view.

Now, it is possible that someone, in isolation, based on having meditated Buddhist instructions in a past life, may in this life, for example, recall those and based on this attain awakening, a so-called pratyekabuddha. But they do not teach.

Now, as far as I am concerned, if one's practice of the path is not grounded on the view of dependent origination, one will not be able to understand reality properly, and one will not be able to wake up. Dependent origination is the "original nature" of everything and there is no "original nature" apart from dependent origination.

The methods used by Buddhist monks during the time of the Buddha to memorize and then transmit what he said were very precise and specific, and frankly, their memories were trained to an amazingly high degree. There is too much agreement between what we have in the Agamas and the Pali Canon to imagine that the Buddha's words were not faithfully preserved. This does not mean there was no variation, or that no distortions crept in. But this particular assertion of the Buddha is so wide spread in so many different sūtras and suttas, that it cannot be ignored in the facile manner you have attempted to do so here.

No one who seriously studies these things refuses to acknowledge that the Agamas and the Pali Canon are a good record of what the Buddha taught his students in person.

Autobiographies are a primary genre in Tibetan literature. The autobiographies are by people who are held to be of high spiritual attainment (e.g., Gyatso, 1998, 103). It might seem incoherent for an enlightened Buddhist to write an autobiography — how can one affirm an autobiography while denying the self?
It is certainly clear that these texts make liberal use of the first person singular. The official rejoinder to this alleged incoherence is that these works treat the author as merely a “conventional” person, not an enduring ultimate self. It is possible to speak of persons in this merely conventional fashion, but Tibetan autobiographies suggest that this is not always consistently upheld. Often in these works, the author is reporting a past experience, and the recollections certainly do not seem to present the distanced perspective afforded by thinking that there really is no persisting self. Rather, they suggest a clear identification with the past experiencer. Consider, for instance, the most famous work in this tradition,The Life of Milarepa. We find the author describing a scene from years earlier in which he had returned to his ancestral home and found human bones among a heap of rags. He writes,

When I realized they were the bones of my mother, I was so overcome with grief that I could hardly stand it. I could not think, I could not speak, and an overwhelming sense of longing and sadness swept over me. (Quintman, 2010, p. 118; see also Shabkar, 1994, p. 32; Kongtrul, 2003; 172–3)

This passage is hardly a dispassionate report that a conventional person consisting of fleeting traits included a set of perceptions. Instead, it seems to be a recollection of a devastating personal experience. It is most plausible that Milarepa, in reflecting on this terrible event, could not suppress the sense that he had the experience of discovering his mother’s bones, even if, in a different register, he would deny that there is
any self in which he consists, or that he is now the same person who endured that experience.
It seems like they thought that someone who has conquered self-grasping (Milarepa) should be suffering from depersonalisation disorder.
One would hope that Jay Garfield at least would know the differences between the approaches of the different TB schools.

Which one is it?

Thomas Amundsen said:
Are you saying that the Lotus Sutra contradicts, say, Chapter Thirteen of the Guhyagarbha tantra? I had always thought they were compatible if interpreted in some kind of subtle way (i.e. the sravakayana and pratyekabuddhayanas necessarily funneling into the bodhisattvayana).

Malcolm wrote:
As you know, the Guhygarbha's statment, "Incorrect realization, partial realization, and not realizing perfectly," refers respectively to nonbuddhists, śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, and those who practice the common Mahāyāna.

However, in the Indian treatises, "ekayāna" means different things. For example, in the Lankāvatāra, ekayāna does not include all the other vehicles. "The One Vehicle" refers to Mahāyāna only because it has not been obtained in the past by others. It is stated that it is because of the karmic traces and knowledge obscuration śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas have that the Buddha teaches three vehicles, and that the teaching of one vehicle is actually only for Mahāyānis. Given that the Lanka was set down quite some time later than the Saddharmapundarika, we can understand this as a response to it. Likewise, the Nirvana responds to the prediction of all sentient beings as capable of attaining Buddhahood in Saddharmapundarika with the notion of the icchantika, while at the same time promoting tathāgatagarbha, as contradictory as that may seem.

There is a discontinuity in so far as what was once afflicted is no longer afflicted. But this does not mean that all or even any actions undertaken while in a state of affliction have any bearing at all in becoming free from affliction.

But your point seems to be that whatever one does while a sentient being inevitably leads to buddhahood. That, in my opinion, would be a very strange view.

You keep asserting there is some identity between some distant being in the past and a buddha in the present. There is a continuum from sentient being hood to buddhahood (the relative, clear aspect of the mind), but there is no identity there, no being at point a who becomes a buddha at point z.

There is a discontinuity in so far as what was once afflicted is no longer afflicted. But this does not mean that all or even any actions undertaken while in a state of affliction have any bearing at all in becoming free from affliction.

But your point seems to be that whatever one does while a sentient being inevitably leads to buddhahood. That, in my opinion, would be a very strange view.

Maybe. If you happen to accept that text. The Buddha also taught there were those who would never attain Buddhahood, so-called icchantkas, in a text you accept as proving the authority of the text you uphold as the Bees Knees of Buddhism.

Seems like a real contradiction to me, that is, in the last sūtra traditionally considered by Mahāyānis to have been taught by the Buddha, the Nirvana Sūtra, he teaches repeatedly on the impossibility of icchantkas attaining buddhahood, after having predicted all sentient beings for full buddhahood in the Saddharmapundarika. Don't see how you square that one.

That does not follow in the least, which is why Greg pointed out that the three poisons which lead to negative karma cannot be construed as paths to Buddhahood.

The path to buddhahood begins with compassion as an indirect cause, but the direct cause is the 37 adjuncts of awakening, beginning with the five faculties and so on.

There's this from the Agamas, which falls short of "eternal", but suggests the Buddha's nirmanakaya could endure to the end of the eon:
There are those who practice the four kinds of supernormal power. While practicing these powers, they are always mindful of these practices so as to keep them in good memory. When one so desires, he can prolong his life on the basis of his power for as long as the remaining duration of the current eon.

O Ānanda, the Buddha has already practiced these four supernormal powers on many occasions and, being mindful of these experiences, he does not forget the use of them. If it is necessary, the Tathāgata can extend his life span for the remaining duration of the present eon, so that he may remove darkness, benefit the world, and make heavenly gods happier.
Ananda didn't take the hint to ask the Buddha to remain, so the Buddha let go.

Malcolm wrote:
Not precisely. It is recorded in various sources that the Buddha extended his life for three months.


Queequeg said:
Then in the Lotus Sutra, the Buddha explains that his life span is of incalculable duration - nitya - and actually endures through the end of the eon.
Since I attained buddhahood,
Immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads
Of koṭis of incalculable kalpas have passed.
I have been constantly teaching the Dharma,
Through these immeasurable kalpas,
Leading and inspiring
Innumerable koṭis of sentient beings
And enabling them to enter the buddha path.
Using skillful means
I have manifested the state of nirvana
To bring sentient beings to this path...


Malcolm wrote:
This passage is the one that the Prithvibandhu commentary (irrespective of its source) asserts is describing the nirmanakāya with the characteristics of a Sambhoghakāya. Vasubandhu is in agreement:

“My pure land does not decay yet living beings perceive its conflagration” means the true pure land of the enjoyment buddha, the Tathāgata, is incorporated in the highest truth.

You leave out some alternate options - in some cases, the Buddha's teachings are upaya to some, inert to others. In other cases, they carry different meaning to different listeners. They're also, in all those cases, perfect expressions of Buddhahood.

A sentient being is by definition under control of the three afflictions and the two obscurations. Buddhas have no afflictions or obscurations. The distinguishing moment is the attainment of vajropama samadhi, which eradicates every last trace of afflictive and knowledge obscurations.

I know it is fun to follow intellectual theories which try to overthrow or blur this distinction, but they are intellectual theories only with no practical application.
