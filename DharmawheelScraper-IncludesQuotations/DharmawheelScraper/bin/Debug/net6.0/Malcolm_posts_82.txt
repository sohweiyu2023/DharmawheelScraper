I already grow and gather most of my herbs.  In the market area of the town there are assorted old guys selling bunches of freshly cut medicinal herbs. I have spent some time researching traditional local usage of many plants and have used them medicinally.  I wish I had more time to spend with people my parents age, they have an amazing knowledge of local medicinal and edible plants.  A twenty minute walk with my mother through my olive groves was an educational experience, she could pick out various edible plants that all looked merely like green leafy grassy plants to me.  The problem is not for rural dwellers like myself that can take a short walk in the surrounding hills and mountains and gather whatever they need, the problem is for all the city dwellers, especially as go further into northern Europe where the climate is not conducive to the growth of many herbs.  And then of course there are medicinal plants that have to be imported.

Now I am not sure if the bans are only on pre-prepared herbal pills and medicines, many of which are prepared by large pharmaceutical companies anyway, or on the herbs themselves.  The good thing about a disorganised and corrupt place like Greece is that it is easy to flout and bypass European laws AND many times the Greek state refuses to or is incapable of enforcing those laws anyway.

In 3 days, the EU will ban much of herbal medicine, pressing more of us to take pharmaceutical drugs that drive the profits of big Pharma.

The EU Directive erects high barriers to any herbal remedy that hasn't been on the market for 30 years -- including virtually all Chinese, Ayurvedic, and African traditional medicine. It's a draconian move that helps drug companies and ignores thousands of years of medical knowledge.

We need a massive outcry against this. Together, our voices can press the EU Commission to fix the directive, push our national governments to refuse to implement it, and give legitimacy to a legal case before the courts. Sign on the right, then forward this campaign to everyone, and let's get to 1 million voices to save herbal medicine:

Something doesn't make sense to me. What is a channel exactly? Air goes into the lungs, the oxygen is taken into blood stream. The yogic method of channels and winds uses channels that are not lungs or blood vessels. How the three channels meet at the base of the body is not connected to a cavity or passage where gas could travel.

Malcolm wrote:
A channel is a channel: veins, arteries and nerves. You can add to this the lymphatic system, though they are considered to act as a support for bring moisture to the nervous system among their other functions.

A cakra in this view is any place in the body where there are clusters of arteries, veins and nerves. You can readily see five such clusters in the body. There are many more.

The channels we visualize are just a method -- why? because when we are visualizing ourselves as a deity, we visualize our bodies as completely hollow, made of light, with no internal organs.

The explicitly stated point of view of Tibetan Medicine is that the avadhūtī is all channels of air i.e. arteries; the rasanā is all channels of fire i.e. the blood vessels, and the lalanā all channels of water i.e. the nerves in the body. This is detailed at length by Zurkhar Lodo Gyalpo, is based primarily on the understanding of the anatomy of the body indicated by the Third Karmapa in his Zabmo Nangdon and reinforced by Desrid Sangye Gyatso. The latter two were both great Dzogchen masters as well though, Zurkharwa was not.

For example, the Kagyu Historian, Thubten Phunstog, has written an interesting commentaries on Tibetan Medicine, Six Yogas of Naropa, and well as Zabmo Nangdon. He makes the case that if channels are not physical structures in the body, then practices like gtum mo would have no effect. Then there is the very interesting doctor in Golok, Menpa Tenzin, who wrote a book based on doing many years of dissection of cadavers which contain very detailed drawings of his research. One may think this unnecessary given Netter's Anatomy and so on, but it is interesting -- and his dissections were guided from a Tibetan Medical perspective. He really explained this principle to us very well when we are interning in Xining. He is a disciple of Khenpo Munsel and In Tibet, he is a well respected Dzogchen master.

In reality, the three channels meet in each of these five (or six) locations in the body, according to the presentation I gave above from Kalackara. This simply means you will find clusters of arteries, veins and nerves at these locations in the body. Again, to restate, when we are doing deity yoga, our bodies are conceived to be hollow -- thus we visualize the channels in various ways depending on what system we are practicing. Hence, according Menpa Tenzin, et al, our visualization does not correspond with the manner in which the three channels actually exist in the body, and more importantly, it does not need to.

The reasons behind this again become very clear when one studies embryology according to Tibetan Medicine, Kalacakra, or Dzogchen Nyinthig. A very good book on this subject has been published by Francis Garret.

However, again, in the West, our idea of ṇāḍis has been very influenced by the acupuncture idea of "meridians" as well as Hindu ideas of cakras and ṇāḍis. The Upanishadic idea of cakras and ṇāḍis is related to the concept of pañcakośa originating in the Taittiriya Upanisha  (which makes this idea a bit older than the Buddha's teaching), where they are explicitly connected with the prāṇamayakośa. On the other hand, the Upanishads are very important to understand, because they contain many ideas and concepts which reappear in altered form (i.e. revised in accordance with Buddha ideas) in Vajrayāna, Ayurveda/Tibetan Medicine, and even in Dzogchen.

Malcolm wrote:
Tsang Nyong Heruka's bio of Mila is an inspired piece of historical fiction based on the many oral traditions he collected travelling all over the Himalayan regions where Milarepa wandered. While I have no doubt that Mila adopted the Tsheringma sisters as guardians since the presence of the five Tseringma sisters as guardians in the Kagyu school is well attested, I don't see any reason to accept Tsang Nyon's narratives at face value.

Further, the permission ritual of Tseringma in the Kagyu sNgags mDzod clearly explains how Padmasambhava bound Tseringma under the secret name "Vajrasamantabhadri", and later how in particular Tseringma was made a specific guardian of Kagyu school by Milarepa.

As I read the account given in this permission ritual, Tseringma was testing Milarepa's yogic ability.

Finally, there is no contradiction between stating, for example, "...among non-human disciples, Tseringma was Milarepa's chief student" and understanding that the twelve tenma were Dzogchen guardians from the beginning.

Generally, however, for Dzogchen, among the twelve Tenma, Dorje Yudronma is regarded as more important. For the Kagyus, Tseringma is more important.

The sadadhātu are a model that is capable of encompassing any state of matter or mind, no matter how subtle or gross, macro, micro, nano, subatomic, etc.

It is inconsistent to say that the five elements function at the macro level of matter and are irrelevant at the subatomic level. The five elements are properties of all matter, period. The medicine tantra states:

"No formation without earth, no cohesion without water, no maturation without fire, no development without air, and no room for development without space."

I will answer myself and refute you. Solidity in matter is an illusion caused by the spinning an electron, which creates an energetic cloud, and thus the mere appearance of solidity. There is no solidity in fact. It is just a charge. A charge is just a positive or negative. An electron is not technically a particle. So there is no atomic solidity.

At the level of subatomic particles, the are spins and lower than that waves. Not a wave in the motion sense. But a wave in the geometric sense. One can never detect motion and position simultaneously at this level.  Again, no solidity. There is also no mass. Quantum people have no idea what accounts for mass. All they have are mathematical models.

Without motion, solidity or mass, the whole phenomenal world collapses. So there is certainly no possibility of observing liquidity, gaseousness or heat. At this level even space is not space. It all converges with information: constants and probabilities.

What does remain are charges: Positive (attracting), negative (repelling) and neither (neutral). These do have a correspondence with the three poisons. To my satisfaction, this here provides perfect explanatory and experiential understanding of why consciousness arises as an interdependence of these three things, why there is no such thing as a universal consciousness, and why there is liberation.

Malcolm wrote:
The five elements are inherent in consciousness; consciousness is inherent in the five elements. There are no levels of subatomic anything which exist outside the sadadhātu, consciousness, space, air, fire, water and earth.

If you want to go further, we could discuss how these gross expressions of the sadadhātu have their corollaries in terms of wisdom and the five lights.

Now you can see that even the subatomic level must have the five elements in order to be material, physical (rūpena).

Your claim that the inner winds are the same as the outer winds has not been borne out, despite various lines of argument. That is my contention.

Malcolm wrote:
My claim is that the winds in the body are based on the process of respiration. I never asserted that they do not undergo change and refinement in the body, of course they do. The function of the lungs is to bring air into body and pass it into the channels, refining it along the way. This vāyu, like any other of the four elements that are taken up by the body, undergoes a process of digestion. Breath is a kind of food. This is why we have rasāyanas of air, which involve prāṇayāma practices to extract the rasa of the vāyu directly and so on.

Anyway, this understanding comes from Tibetan Medicine. For example, one of my teachers, Tamdrin Gyal from Amdo, when explaining topics from Rangjung Dorje's famed Zabmo Nangdon to us asserted that while the vāyu/vatta of the body comes from external element of air conducted into the body through breathing, the air element outside the of body does not possess all seven characteristics of vāyu present in the body i.e, rough, light, cold, motile, subtle and hard.

When we talk about the five elements in the body, we always refer to them as the five refined elements. But, for example, Padmsambhava is very clear that the five refined elements in the body come from the five gross elements upon which we depend for life.

These kinds of issues are discussed in great detail in Tibetan medicine.

The meaning of prāṇa is "life". If there life in the sun?

The Vajramālā states very plainly:

The characteristic of the the element of air (vāyu)
is the vāyu (air) pervading the six cakras,
always present in the dharmacakra,
called prāṇa since it pervades migrating beings"

And:

The wheel of vāyu is explained to be prāṇa.

And apropos of the Kalacakra citation in the last post it states:

Depending on upper or lower,
the major vāyus, prāṇa and apana are located.

Prāṇa vāyu is furthere defined in this text:

From the traces of the all-basis consciousness
arises the stream of consciousness;
the affliction [consciousness] is the prāṇa vāyu.

So at least in Buddhist texts these things are very precisely defined.

Also, I can see how you may have misunderstood my question above. I was asking... since ejaculation (and of course urination etc) are caused by the dvw, what are you proposing in these cases? In the case of flatulence, you explain that the dvw moves downward and leaves the body. What is your proposition with respect to any of the other eliminations through lower doors, as they are not composed of air?

Of course they "happen becasue of the" dvw, but your claim that the dvw is actually the air that moves when we are flatulent is a misleading example as it does not mapo on to any other function of the dvw. My question is: how to explain in the case of movement that is not physical air, but rather liquid, etc.

Malcolm wrote:
We are not communicating well.

That flatus is the downward voiding wind is a fact. The apana-vāyu is also responsible for moving liquids out of the body such as sperm, urine and so forth, as well as solids such as feces. It's location in the body is the pelvic region.

There is a passage in the Kalacakra that describes the anus as being the lower end of the central channel. The famous Doctor Zurkar Lodo Gyalpo explains the following in his "Oral Advice of the Grandfathers",  his commentary on the formation of the body chapter in the Explanatory Medicine Tantra

This verse (from the Explanatory Tantra) "The channels of formation divide into three from the navel" demonstrates the lalanā, rasanā and the lower end of the avadhūtī. The channel that creates kapha, etc., is the lalanā through which the element of water moves. The channel that creates blood and so on is the rasanā through which the element of fire moves. The channel that creates vāyu and so on is the lower part of the avadhūti. The lower ends of the rasanā and lalanā are demonstrated through implication. These three tips both below and above the navel are applied according to the intention of the Shri Kalacakra i.e. the Adibuddha states:

Those have three tips below,
likewise, three tips above. 
The tip of Rahu is present in the center,
the tip of Surya is on the right,
the tip of Candra is on the left. 
The vāyus of water, fire and space
move feces, urine, and sukra
through the bottom of the right, left, and central [channels].
The channels interlaced like a chain
are the three pathways of the prāṇa and the apaṇa.

The great commentary states "In terms of the the so called 'channel interlaced into a chain which runs to the location of amrita', the amritaṇāḍī is in forehead. "Moving there" is moving into the location of amrita i.e. the lalanā, the rasanā, and the avadhūtī. Since those are interlaced like a chain, having made three pathways between the navel and the heart, once again they intersect in the center of the heart in the center of the avadhūtī. The lalanā and the rasanā move to the right and left sides. After that, between the heart and the throat, they make three paths. In the same way they are three paths between the throat and the forehead, and likewise between the forehead and crown. Having made three paths four times, the lalanā ends in twelve different locations other from the left nostril. The rasanā from the right (nostril). The avadhūtī leaves simultaneously from both nostrils. Likewise, having made three paths below the navel and again below the secret cakra, between feces and urine moving from the right and the left, and in the center of the secret lotus there is the conch nāḍī. Below the conch nāḍī, the mahāmalā (great waste i.e. rectum) channel moves from the center. From penis or the vagina, the urine channel moves from the left, and the seminal channelfrom right."


Incidentally, in the Blue Beryl, Desri Sangye Gyatso reproduces the above passage more or less in its entirety without comment.

I should think the meaning of all of this is rather clear.

There are three vāyus that are subsets of the apana vāyu. The apāna vāyu in general governs the lower ends of the three channels. The three lower channels are the rectum i.e. the lower end of the central channel; the urinary tract i.e. the lower end of the lalanā, and the channel which emits semen or ovum i..e the lower end of the rasanā channel.

When someone has an excess of apana vāyu, they fart, or have diarrhea, etc. There are many disorders they have have connected with the three lower passages. We take wind in, some of it is expelled from the lower end of the body as flatus.

However, I will allow that my understanding of many tantric topics has been altered considerably through my studies of Tibetan medicine.

But prana could be with or within water or deep in the earth or on Mars; it need not be confined only to the air on the surface of this planet?  As for slight respiration through the skin; what about yogis buried for 2 or 3 months, surely they would have used up all the air-prana by then.

Hi Will,

There is no "prāṇa" out there in genera separate from the vāyu element. Prāṇa is just a name for the vāyu that supports life in the body of a sentient being.

The idea that prāṇa is some universal life force is exactly the new age idea that I am criticizing.

Namdrol: prāṇa is a vāyu i.e. prāṇa vāyu (srog dzin rlung) aka "the life sustaining wind". This comes from our breath and no where else.


Not sure about the prana source being only breath.  That would mean a deep samadhi state where breath stops, could not last that long - but it does - many hours, days & beyond.  Since prana pervades the atmosphere around us, that prana is somehow absorbed during samadhi, without the lungs functioning.

Malcolm wrote:

There is no prāṇa as a separate entity. This is a huge misconception. There is a prāṇa vāyu i.e. the breath we inhale.

As far not breathing during certain states of samadhi -- during these state the respiration is so slight it is not noticed. It is still happening however.

I have always found that wind, fire, water and earth are confusing terms. I prefer motility, temperature, liquidity and solidity. These are retained by basic physics and tend to make the yogic practices jibe with modern understandings. Furthermore, going beyond these gross elements are the subtle "elements" of the sub-atomic world, those would be attraction, repulsion and neutrality (space). I have found these to be extremely apropos, because the three poisons of samsara are attachment, aversion and ignorance. I feel these are a perfect correspondence. Thus, in the realization of Atiyoga or Mahamudra, when grasping has ceased by recognition of the nature of basic space dharmadhatu, attachment and aversion have ceased; thus, the basic cause of matter, that is, attraction, repulsion and deluded space are unbound. Because dharmadhatu has qualities deluded ordinary space does not, there are the three kayas and the body, speech and mind of buddha.


Malcolm wrote:
Earth, air fire and water in one sense refer to the three states of matter with the presence or absence of heat being responsible for phase transition between states.

This replicates down no matter how far you go in physical reality.

But for our purposes, for example, discussing pranayāma and other such issues -- it obvious that vāyu is a name for the air that we are breathing in.

Basic space, incidentally, is a very bad rendering of dharmadhātu, and is not supported by commentaries.

Malcolm wrote:
There are five elements: earth, water, fire, air and space -- they are material, whether coarse or subtle.

When transmigration happens at the time of death, the mind/wind leaves specific orifices of the body, or channel openings. This would bot be necessary if the wind upon which the mind is mounted was not itself physical and material.

For example, when you have flatulence, this comes from the apana vāyu, the downward-voiding wind. That flatus is apana-vāyu.

Vāyu in the body is coarse or subtle depending upon how much it is moving. But it is still something physical, part of the rūpa skandha.

If you cannot accept this explanation, then you have to invent terms that do not exist in the original Tibetan and Sanskrit texts, such as the Vajramālā tantra that explain things like vāyus and so on.

I prefer to not to interpolate new age ideas onto Vajrayāna. So, I accept that vāyu in the body comes from the breath. If you think about it long enough, you will understand that I am correct. You need to study tantric embryology. When you do, this will make more sense to you.

I've had five clear visions beginning with my first memory. I have always had a nonstop fascination with crazy yogi sadhus and an aspiration to be one. Before I met any Dzogchen teachers I found the Seven Line Prayer and instantly started reciting it and felt intense natural rigpa blaze. Friends like Tony Duff helped me out with texts and deepened my experience. Yogini Changchub Palmo, student of Chatral Rinpoche, gave me a lot of affirmation. Over the years I've spent thousands of hours on listening and re-listening to ChNN. I've wondered if that Ati master is coming or what? Then, I'm also the "heart-son" to a Drikung lama, and that makes the situation weirder. Then I practice Dzogchen dedicatedly. I can't help it. I had a clear dream recently after practicing Togal similar to one KDL describes with a message from Ekajati. I received Tigle Gyachen without a reading transmission and definitely powerful blessings and I started to see signs in my dreams too. I'm puzzled by this. I feel Ekajati is throwing me blessings. The only connection I can make is that my family lineage ancestral homeland is the area that would now be considered Swat and all that surrounds it. My family heritage is that we were the kings of the land. The Puru. The Puru are the oldest living family lineage on the planet. It goes back 5000 years so I don't know. There's actually a Wikipedia article about it. I have no idea who wrote it. I know from family we have an intensely spiritual history, that includes Hindus, Buddhists and Sikhs. There must be a past life connection somewhere. I want you to know that for me Ekajati is a teacher; at least I feel it if I'm doing something wrong by Ati. I physically will feel sick. It's like a barometer. What I'm saying here is from my heart of hearts. No bullshit. That's where I'm at. I'm gauging.

That is correct, there are many different versions of the Song of the Vajra, in many different termas. They all share basic characteristics, however.

The one ChNN uses is more or less identical to the version Longchenpa presents in the Theg mchog mdzod apart from one or two syllables, differences that can be accounted for through scribal transcription errors from umed to uchen when the original blocs were prepared.

So the coarse freedom from grasping of sutra becomes progressively more subtle.

It seems to me that the freedom from grasping explained in sutra becomes more subtle as the energy winds supporting the view gather and are pacified, so perhaps clear light and Dzogchen view differ in presentation only.

Namdrol said:
What I meant was that freedom from grasping is progressively more and more subtle as one moves through the practices of the nine yānas.

No need to add "energy" to winds. The composition of vāyus is vāyu, the element of air. We term them "winds" in English because they move through the channels of body. Wind is moving air -- no movement, no wind.

N

cloudburst said:
so dzogchen view is sutra view of freedom from grasping made more and more subtle as one moves through the yanas. This is description also aptly describes the mind of clear light.

the purpose in adding "energy" to winds is to differentiate "moving air" from moving energy. If you already understand this, there is as you say no need for this term. There is however no fault in adding it for purposes of clarity.

Malcolm wrote:
I guess I am not explaining this clearly: dzogchen view is the ultimate freedom from grasping, quite beyond sūtra.

The only difference between wind in your body and wind outside your body is that it is in your body. There is no "energy" apart from vāyu. There are ten vāyus. The less those vāyus move in the body, the more subtle the mind becomes.

I don't think adding the term "energvy" makes the concept about what is happening in the human body any clearer, and rather more muddled.

So prasangika was both created from and is productive of experience of the Ultimate.

In Dzogchen, mind and matter exist because of avidya. When there is no more avidyā,for you there is niether mind nor matter.

But to get back to the main point -- for example we talk about "subtle minds". What are subtle minds, what makes them subtle? The reduced frequency of spanda, pulsation, movement of the vāyu in the body. When the vāyu moves, concepts arise -- no movement, no concepts. No concepts, nothing really we can all mind at all. When the vāyu moves very little, then we call that "a subtle mind". Sutra for example, has no methods to reduce the movement of vāyu to such an extent that such "subtle minds" are accessed. In sutra methods, the movements of mind are always coarse -- apart from that fact that as a bodhisattva moves through the paths and stages the physical body they appropriate becomes ever more refined and thus the movement of vāyu becomes ever more subtle and unobstructed, especially after the eighth bhumi. But this is a very external approach, taking a long time.

I tried many times to get in the habit of drinking a little red wine during meals. It's excellent for one's health. The problem is that when I drink the good stuff, I get lazy as hell and don't feel like working. Portugal has an excellent whine, by the way. Usually I end up drinking a glass or two when I have dinner with my parents. And I really like it, accompanying food. But at my place, and since my wife doesn't drink (because of the flavor), I end up drinking zilch. And this is not the best thing for my health. I remember doctors saying when my grandfather died, (stroke due to arteriosclerosis) that if he drank a little his life could have been longer. Spirits only produce the dilation of blood vessels, but red wine has twice the effect and is filled with anti oxidants. If one doesn't have the precept, a glass of red wine a meal is a favor one does to his health. This is why I would like to gain such habit, but I'm not seeing it happening. Not that I don't like it, but I don't like the numbness I feel mixed with having to work or whatever. Nice at a dinner at the weekends, but not everyday...
Of course there are people who drink too much. It's a real problem, mostly when they decide to drive afterwards.
I think people should take a vow if they fear not being able to hold the drink. So they take a vow: I'll never drink, and stick to it. But if people can perfectly moderate their intake, why the need of a vow? Is it something symbolic? I mean, they can always take the vow, but is there such need? Why would one impose such a thing to oneself? There may come a time at a wedding or something and one will have to refuse a harmless cup of champagne, risking offending others, because of a vow that could be unnecessary right from the start. I think we should only take vows if we feel there's the absolute need. Otherwise we just act wisely, no vows needed.

There is a bias in the Buddhist tradition that the merit of an act is reinforced if connected with a vow.

The author of the Bodhicitta Vivarana was the disciple of Saraha. In the Sakya version of sahaja-mahāmudra, this text and one of the dohas of Saraha (which one I forget) are critical commentaries. So from a Sakya POV, the Sahaja-Mahāmudra lineage of Saraha and NāgaArjuna is very connected with Guhyasamaja.

Anyone who manifests buddhahood in life, according to them, is because of past life karma, being a bodhisattva in a previous life, and all that.

In Dzogchen, mind and matter are regarded as seamlessly welded, not that mind has primacy over matter. Dzogchen texts even go so far as to reject the formless realm as truly formless.

This is why for example the Khandro Nyinthig states very clearly "Sometimes we say "citta", sometimes "vāyu",but the meaning is the same."Vāyu is just the element of air i.e. motility present in matter. This also accounts for rebirth. In the Guhyasamaja, for example, the ālayavijñāna is wedded to the mahāprāṇavāyu -- this union allows rebirth to happen.

Mind and matter are inseparable from a tantric point of view. Your view reduces the tantric view of mind and matter to the level of sūtra, in my opinion. I take the unpopular stance (according to standard Tibetan orthodoxy ala Sapan, et al) that the view of tantra regarding these kinds of issues is superior in every respect to that of sūtra, and Dzogchen even more so than tantra. The view and practice of tantra and Dzogchen has been crippled in Tibetan discourse by a need to justify everything according to sūtra.

adinatha said:
This is a method wisdom thing. Sometimes we say "citta" and sometimes we say "vayu" is saying that wind and mind is wind-mind. So the motility of air is the motility of consciousness. Inseparability and unity is a distinction without a difference. For example in rigpa the empty quality, the clarity quality and the energy qualities can be looked at separately, like looking separately at the facets of a gem, but their inseparability means unity, one rigpa. It is often said rigpa has many faces, but all those faces are on one head. So this is a method wisdom thing, because a view like this doesn't mean anything useful unless it is to get a yogi to see something important in samadhi. Your worry about Dzogchen being crippled by sutra must be coming from a standpoint that a method involving channels and winds is depreciated when yogis have an ecumenical view. I'm curious why you think this when the method of Togal depends on direct introduction (and devotion), postures and gazes, and knowledge of channels and winds is really just for the sake of background information to explain why Togal works better than a volitional sadhana involving channels and winds, like tummo. What Togal does par excellence is highlight tsal aspect of rigpa, but that's a highlight, the overall light is rigpa complete. There is also realization that is rigpa everywhere including as mountains, rocks, trees and houses. Maya.  One can either be non-abiding and take a form body or dissolve into dharmata. Finally, everything exhausts into dharmata which is not non-existence. If it is not non-existence, well?...

Malcolm wrote:
Taking hinayana refuge has three commitments and five vows that are automatically taken. Then one has a choice to follow no vows, and just commitments, two vows, three vows or all vows.

Taking bodhisattva vows converts those vows into the Mahayana vows.

Taking tantric vows converts those in the tantric vows.

Where the lower contradicts the higher, one follows the higher vow.

There there is the principle of refuge according to Dzogchen. In this case, there are no vows in particular, but the person judges for himself what is necessary for his path, what helps it and what hinders it. I.e. taking the essence of refuge as committing to a given path (in this case Dzogchen) and doing what is necessary for achieving the goals of that path and avoiding what is harmful to it. That is something each person must discover for themselves. If it is involves giving up wine and rich food because it is fattening and leads to ill-health, than that is what you do. If it involves drinking a glass of wine and eating rich food because one has a tendency towards vata disturbances, than that is what one does. If it involves taking psych meds to maintain a stable mind, than that is what one does. And of course, because harming others leads to states of bad rebirth, etc., than one avoids actions with true negative consequences. But none of this is based on a vow. It is based on recognition of one's state and the wish to help others recognize their own state.

Now, of course, this does not mean that one does not have vows. Of course one has vows. But vows are not the main point. It is not good to go to one extreme and proclaim "vows are all bullshit" and pretend one is an atiyoga practitioner. It is also not good to take a rigid approach to vows and turn them into a kind of pretty golden cage inside of which you lock yourself.

Not only that, not all buddhas teach vinaya and have a sangha. For example, Sikhin. Sikhin's pratimoksha was simply:

Avoid evil,
do good,
observe your mind
this is the teaching of the buddhas.

So we have to understand the Vinaya, vows and so on, these are something relative. They are not absolutely essential, at least, not in my opinion.

The view here is Yogachara Madhyamaka, similar to Shantarakshita.

"Pure consciousness" is not a good rendering for sems tsam po (cittamatra) -- i.e. mere mind.

The normative Madhyamaka view re: consciousness would be that a consciousness arises conventionally only if there is an object and an organ meeting. Hence, conventionally speaking, normative Madhyamaka allows for the existence of external phenomena.

So does Dzogchen.

Citta-matra is a method, not a view, in this respect. The view is still madhyamaka.

However, that doesn't hold up re Four Yogas because, while Gampopa stated the four yogas in a variety of ways, Mila had a song of four yogas and Saraha has a four yoga-like presentation too. Clearly to me four yogas comes from Saraha and is based on the Hevajra Tantra four moments, four blisses, and all those fours. Basically, based on Gampopa's own experience, he did what Mila told him not to do and that was teach sahaja mahamudra independent of tummo.


Malcolm wrote:
Have you considered the possibility that the Mila song is a later composition?

It is far more likely that the four yogas were adapted from Ratnakarashanti's Madhyamaka-alamkara and its upadesha where four yogas are explicitly taught. Alternately, they were adapted from the four samadhis of Semsde. Adzom Drugpa, when presenting Semsde, actually uses the scheme of the four yogas.

Then the termas which transmit tummo, being post-Hevajra means Guru Padma felt it better these should be revealed after Hevajra? Or it also implies the termas with tummo are Hevajra knock-offs.

Again, you have the same problem as the radical physicalists with such an explanation. You may be able to account for the process in a physical sense, but nevertheless can not account for how this physical process gives rise to, or is, the qualitative experience of something mental.

Malcolm wrote:
The problem is yours merely for framing the question in that way.  There are six dhātus -- earth, water, fire, air, space and consciousness. They form a continuum from gross to subtle. But even so called consciousness has the properties of the other five, so it stands to reason that the other five have the properties of consciousness as well. Hence, nāma and rūpa are completely inseparable -- not because "everything is mind" as our friend adinatha would have it, but rather because the six dhātus themselves describe six different fields which are completely intermeshed and interrelated. In other words, the physical universe innately possesses the capacity for intelligence. There is no consciousness at any time, anywhere that is free from matter.




Namdrol said:
I'm not actually restating any sutra position here. This is such a basic philosophical issue of continual relevance in the face of modern science that hasn't produced a satisfactory answer so far, and you're basically trying for a freebie pass on this by re-hashing totally standard failed arguments on this topic under the guise of 'it's nondual man'.

It still doesn't account for the connection between the epistemic experience of mentality and the physical process this is supposedly the same as. It remain a 'magic' factor here and this isn't changed by going nondual on it without accounting for how it is supposedly so. It is the basic question the philosophical zombie can not ask: If mind is something physical, how is it that my experience is something mental? Claiming it is nondual simply moves the obvious problem of dualist mind-body causation in a lateral and less obvious direction, but it doesn't resolve the problems of it.

Malcolm wrote:
It completely resolves the problem. Matter is intelligent. If it was not, then we would be inert corpses. Assuming that mind and matter are somehow uniquely different in an absolute substantial sense is Cartesian Dualism. In fact, you can either say matter is the gross manifestation of consciousness or that consciousness is the most subtle manifestation of matter, it does not really matter. The sadadhātu has one cause — avidyā. When that cause, avidyā is removed, all six sadadhātus vanish. In the meantime, consciousness is not separable from the pañcamahābhutani. This nature of consciousness argument engaged in by Chalmers, and the physicalists is pretty boring. There is no split between mind and matter -- thinking there is one is a double delusion.

They look for their cultural origin not to ancient Tibetan culture -- which originated more or less in Kongpo and moved west into the Yarlung valley, but rather than ancient culture around Kailash known as Zhang Zhung Kingdom which dominated central Tibet, Western Tibet and surrounding regions for many centuries until 7th century C.E.

What makes it Yogacara is when in direct yogic perception you see what is most fundamental, pure awareness is at the base, and there are no phenomena there. In post-absorption, phenomena clearly emerge from consciousness and thereby appear in their true form as maya.

Malcolm wrote:
Prior to analyzing phenomena as mind-only, mind and matter are conventionally regarded as a dualism even in Yogacara. Why, because the imputed nature is exactly the conventional world.

Also in standard Madhyamaka, on the conventional level mind and matter are regarded as distinct.

While the annutarayoga tantras move in the direction of dissolving the distinction between mind and matter, the substance dualism in Buddhism is only satisfactorily resolved in Dzogchen (but not by regarding all phenomena as mind-- which is a point of view rejected by Longchenpa  incoherent).

In Dzogchen, mind and matter are regarded as seamlessly welded, not that mind has primacy over matter. Dzogchen texts even go so far as to reject the formless realm as truly formless.

This is why for example the Khandro Nyinthig states very clearly "Sometimes we say "citta", sometimes "vāyu",but the meaning is the same."Vāyu is just the element of air i.e. motility present in matter. This also accounts for rebirth. In the Guhyasamaja, for example, the ālayavijñāna is wedded to the mahāprāṇavāyu -- this union allows rebirth to happen.

Mind and matter are inseparable from a tantric point of view. Your view reduces the tantric view of mind and matter to the level of sūtra, in my opinion. I take the unpopular stance (according to standard Tibetan orthodoxy ala Sapan, et al) that the view of tantra regarding these kinds of issues is superior in every respect to that of sūtra, and Dzogchen even more so than tantra. The view and practice of tantra and Dzogchen has been crippled in Tibetan discourse by a need to justify everything according to sūtra.

Namdrol,

You say that in Vajrayana they add a third - not known before component, vayu, what makes a dualist view monist? I'm not sure if monism is really a better concept than dualism when both are pretty much substantialist. Also, if dharmas are understood not as ultimate realities but provisional categories of multiform functions within the realm of experience there is neither dualism nor monism.


Namdrol said:
Vāyu is the material element of air (part of the rūpaskandha). Specifically, the mind and the prana vāyu are merged and inseparable.

The Mind/body problem is one that plagues rebirth explanations because Sutrayāna Buddhists are unable to give an account of the medium through which a mind passes from one body to the next. Vajrayāna in general solves that problem through vāyu. Such an account simply does not exist in sutra.

In sutrayāna mind and matter are different substances.

In other words, "karma works during this life, but not before nor after" is an arbitrary & silly argument against rebirth.

From a Buddhist POV, this is the epitome of sloppy spirituality:

"While his teaching is Zen-inspired, he works to integrate several of the Nondual teachings from the contemplative traditions of Vedanta Hinduism, Christianity, Kabbalah, and Sufiism."

Non-dual (advaya) in Buddhism has a completely different meaning than non-duality (advaitā) in Vedanta, etc. The ein, ein sof and ohr ein sof of Kabbalah is not related to emptiness in Buddhism, but it is theological attempt by Kabbalists to explain ex nihilo creation, etc.

The above biographical statement of yours informs this statement:

"We begin to see that this whole beautiful dance is only ever Spirit seeing itself through us..."

While among Vedantists, Sufis, Kabbalists and so on there may be much to discuss, Buddhists will have little to share with them apart from a shared interest in compassion.

Now why do I choose to use the word attitude instead of the word statement?  Because the statement may actually be true.  I cannot judge its veracity.  But the reality of all I have seen thus far, in terms of the results of practice (not only for myself but for 99% of other TB practitioners) is that the "so far" of sutra based practice is "so far" out of reach for the majority of TB practitioners that it is silly to even begin to judge (and criticise) the practice of other traditions as limited, or merely a step along the path.  We are so far from reaching even that step that we have no right to criticise the EA path (or any other path for that matter).  I severely doubt whether most practitoners have passed the second jhana of meditative concentration, yet we are quick off the mark to condemn the spiritual practice and level of the Arhats.

We say our practice will lead us to the state of Bodhisattva, but most times we use our Bodhisattva Vow to merely justify our incapacity to act within the moral/ethical guidelines established by Theravadra practice.  Then we have the gall to stand on the tip of Mt Meru and condemn the Bodhisattva path when the only Mt Meru most have us have ever seen is the centre of the universe that exists in our underpants!

I have been able to enter the 'dream zone' level and participate fully - whilst awake & meditating - for some time, but have had little ability to be aware whilst actually dreaming/sleeping itself – I thought that this book might assist me, as this seemed to be the proper way to practice, rather than whilst awake. I intend to follow the instructions given in chapter two and continue to read onward also - however, I have a question that remains.

Is it suitable/proper practice to use my ability to live and learn in this 'dream zone' whilst awake & meditating until I perfect doing so during sleep?

Before practicing Buddhism, I called it my 'spiritual life zone' and instead of considering myself to be meditating, I assumed I was 'contemplating philosophy' & 'living on a spiritual level' as an escape because real life sucked - since taking up Buddhist practice, I have changed my understandings and activities in this area from 'fun & freedom' to 'learning and understanding' - but I am wondering if I should focus solely on perfecting the 'asleep' dream zone practices, or if it is 'ok' to continue to participate whilst awake?

This is the sole place in the MMK where Nāgārjuna actually advances a shravaka position he likes. See Mabja, ppg. 353-359.

As I said, this is originally a Sammitya doctrine. See also Karmasiddhiprakarana, ppg, 87-91 for a translation of Candrakirti's take.

Nevertheless, even though among various shravaka theories that Nagarjuna examines, this is one he apparently likes, still, from a Madhyamaka perspective he finds the idea of this avipraṇāśa unnecessary even though it is a teaching of the Buddha.

As an amendment:

The above illustrates what I have experienced to be a very reliable approach:
The "gold standard" is the Buddha's teachings in the sutta pitaka. Every teaching that does not have "a correlate" there either has to be handled very very cautiously or - maybe better (safer) in many cases - has to be rejected.
So the basis necessarily has to be one's own experience. Therefore it is very problematic to surrender one's own experience to someone who does not teach "the gold standard" in the first place.

It seems to me, as it appears in the Namkhai Norbu and Chögyam Trungpa quotes, that they take Zen to be only about emptiness and based on prajnaparamita. It is actually a strange interpretation to me since one of the most fundamental tenets of Zen is "mind is Buddha" and it is actually based on tathagatagarbha teachings. Why they still think that Zen is only about emptiness is a mystery to me.

It is an interpretation based on Chan as it was presented to Tibetans by a number of Chinese masters of the Northern school. There are a few Chan texts authored by Tibetans in Dunhuand corpus. One of them is by Trisong De'utsan.

It does seems though that even a division based on mind might have some significant ontological implications, for example the two truths being ontologically distinct and even hierarchical.

The two truths are not ontologically distinct because emptiness if not a form of being, and appearances are not either.

Teachers have only one job -- lead students to liberation. If they cannot do that, they are stealing people's precious human birth.

Most of the hierarchy in Buddhism comes from Asian cultural forms. It can be dispensed with in the modern world.

Of course, we need to respect people and their choices -- so if someone is keen on a super-hierarchical school like Shambhala International, we should respect their choice. Of course if I am going to see some traditional Asian teacher, I will do prostrations out of respect. When you have respect, you can't have pride. Respect is the real prostration. When ever you respect someone, then you are prostrating to them.

For the most spiritually gifted, the lowest teaching is sufficient to bring them to Buddhahood.  For the most spiritually-challenged, even the highest teachings could not budge them.

Lowest teaching has the least explanation of the ultimate truth and least of method to reach there.  So only the spiritually gifted could use it as a vehicle to Buddhahood.

Socialism was an important movement, but is not relevant anymore.

Why? Because socialism is too human-centric. The distinctions between Marxist, Reformist and Utopian forms of socialism are academic. They are no longer relevant.

The older I get the more I am moving towards a sort of anarcho-green position or left-biocentrism. I think this political form is the most consistent with Buddhist principles and especially with Dzogchen, which has always been anti-hierarchical.

In the sang I do it is quite clear that the reason to do it is to benefit sentient beings and making offerings to the Buddhas and three roots. In general that is the point with all Vajrayana rituals it seems to me.

Malcolm wrote:
Depends on what sang. The real purpose of sang is to purify. That is what the word "bsangs" actually means -- to cleanse. In this case we are cleansing with smoke.

Many sangs are quite specific, restricted to one location, one local guardian and so on. General sangs offerings, like Riwo Sangcho, are purification rites focused on the four guests.

The original sang offering left by Padmsambhava in Tibet i.e. Kama tradition, is the famous Nol sangs i.e. "purifying pollution". Lamas frequently combine this with Riwo Sangcho for a more full effect.

Kyosan,

I don't think they should convert to any EA school, that's not really the question I think. But rather the interest in other forms of Buddhism. For instance I've heard about a plan that they translated the Pali Canon to Tibetan. That's great. However, I don't see Tibetan teachers addressing the issue of other Buddhist schools outside of the Tibetan ones. They are good to discuss Hinayana, Mahayana, Kagyu, Sakya, etc. but no mention of Pure Land, Chan, Tiantai or Shingon. Maybe they haven't heard about them? I doubt that, especially as many know English and even Chinese. To give an example, it is not expected at all from a Nyingma master to become a Gelug or Kagyu lama but definitely he should be somewhat familiar with their teachings, especially when they do some comparisons between the teachings.

Tibetan Buddhism strikes me as more doctrinally fixed/focused than east-Asian Buddhism. And thus, is probably more reluctant to absorb new input to its doctrinal outlook. And probably doubly so considering such input is informed by the lower sutrayana, itself a fixed lens for analysis that in many ways fails to capture the intricacies of east-Asian Mahayana. And in many cases, Indian Mahayana too, for that matter.

Chinese Mahayana is in many ways a more diffuse entity than Tibetan Buddhism and thus probably more receptive to new influences, of which Tibetan Buddhism present a wealth of to draw from.

No, we don't. We live this way because we each have 50,000 slaves in other countries working their asses off for nothing.

We pay the least amount for our food because our food is produced by cheap labor by impoverished migrant workers, where it is not farmed in Mexico etc. Our TVs are manufactured in sweatshops in China (so is the Mac I am writing this on). We live a "great" life because corporations have gutted the manufacturing sector of the US economy, sent it oversees and now they just use us as bovine cattle to feed commodities to -- having reduced our economy to services and consumerism. Our economy has no foundation anymore. That is what "free market" capitalism did for us. We live in perpetual bubbles that are not propped on real assets.

And the food that evil corporations "made so cheap", as I pointed out above comes at the price of terrible suffering. Moreover, most of that cheap "food" is not even edible. It's crap. Most of what you get in normal supermarkets in the US is inedible, un-nutritious, chemically farmed on dead soil with toxic pesticides and herbicides. It is unhealthy "food".

I could go on but there is no point. You are welcome to your Neo-con fantasy, but that is all it is. I hope you wake up from your republican dream.

Jikan said:
One of Adorno's contemporaries, Karel Kosik, put together what may well be the closest position to dependent origination I've seen outside of Buddhist literature in _Dialectics of the Concrete_.  It put Kosik in real difficulties with the Soviets though (he was a Czech writer)... so he's not well known at all.  (Official philosophy in the Soviet Union at this time was itself eternalist in the sense of being idealistic, reductive, speculative, and constipated.)

There's something inherently anti-authoritarian in anti-eternalist, anti-idealist thinking.  Lenin's materialism shows this up too (and he has a sense of humor about it), but at the fault not of nihilism, but of accepting the reality of objects outside the mind.  That is:  Lenin was too simplistic a materialist in my opinion.  Even if objects are reducible to nothingness or their constituents, they're still real objects and not only conventionally.  The rationale is that you need an ontology if you want an ethics (actions have to matter) and a politics (some object of public concern).

Following this argument, Zizek assumes that because Buddhists understand objects to be empty, we have no basis for ethics or politics.  This is an error in my view. Zizek has a good handle on new-agey stuff, "conscious capitalism" and workplace meditation workshops, but a poor handle on Buddhism proper.  (Is it obvious I'm working on a dissertation proposal about this? or rather procrastinating...?)

It seems strange that hundred year old debates in philosophy (Lenin tearing the Ken Wilbers of his day a new one) are relevant again now.  Interesting world we inhabit.

I think that's just for his Longsal Longde. Because recently he taught the essence of Dzogchen sde gsum by Chogyur Lingpa and while there was an essential teaching on the 4 brda of Longde there was no initiation for it.
And he has not done a major cycle of empowerments since 2002 when he gave a long transmission for many cycles of his own termas known as the klong gsal mkha' 'gro snying thig.
I wish I had the merit to be following Rinpoche at that time already.

Malcolm wrote:
And whose experience? An ordinary deluded persons experience? Is the direct perception of ordinary persons to be trusted? Knowing that you possess the three afflictions, how certain are you that your direct perceptions are to be trusted, since you never experience them directly. All direct perceptions are non-conceptual, uninterpreted; all so called "experience" is conceptual, interpreted. In order for a direct perception to be experienced there must be a reflexive awareness capable of recognizing that direct perception and framing it as an experience, for example, pleasant, unpleasant, neutral and so on. Why? Because direct perceptions are not self-reflexive. They are not aware that they are cognitions. We can know this because we have direct perceptions of many things in our visual field, for example, which we do not notice. We either process them out or cannot recognize them. Thus they are not part of our "experience". Experience is conceptual. And for ordinary persons, afflicted. So I would hesitate before declaring that the Buddha claims experience is decisive. Decisive for whom is the question. Experience is certainly not decisive for ordinary persons. If it were, than there would be no need for a path.

There are certain Buddhists, who recognizing that non-Buddhists will not accept vacana as authorities try to the prove the buddha is authority through direct perception and inference so that they will accept vacana as an authority. These scholars themselves accept vacana as an authority.

The third category are the non-Buddhist lokayatis, materialists. Materialist views have begun to make inroads into Buddhism; for example insisting that direct perception along is valid. You seem to follow the latter line of thinking.

In Vajrayāna mind (སེམས) and the vāyu (རླུང) are completely inseparable. In the teaching of Dzogpachenpo, not only are they inseparable, but Guru Rinpoche remarks to Yeshe Tsogyal that mind and vāyu are synonymous with one another. You can discover this by reading the མཁའ་འགྲོ་སྙིང་ཐིག་རྒྱབ་ཆོས.

Therefore, the correlate of "nirvana" would be conditioned and impermanent. Thus you are in contradiction with the Buddha's teaching that the correlate of the term "nirvana" is unconditioned and permanent. Since the putative correlate of a "cessation" ceases due to an absence of a cause, the correlate of a "cessation" cannot be predicated until such putative correlates of a "cause" are no longer present.

This use of language is cumbersome.

In plainer language, since you assert that a cessation is caused, cessations as a consequence would be conditioned. The negative consequence that you have to accept is that nirvana would be conditioned.

Accept the three wheels. Anything that arises from a cause is a conditioned dharma. If you assert that cessations are caused, you are asserting they are conditioned.

I've been possessed by a spirit(s) for the past 16 months, which has made my life and specifically my meditation practice quite difficult. I had a mirror divination done my Lama Dawa when it first started and was told:

Question: I feel there is a demon or entity harming my life and my practice. It frequently deludes me and seems to possess me. Is this a real entity, and if so, what type of entity?
Answer: Your energy channels are very weak, which allows for different spirits to possess you. In particular you are being affected by a spirit named 'Batarey Pandey'.

In a later question he told me wearing a Hayagriva amulet should repel him, so I tried this, but to no avail. So then I decided I should try and stengthen my energy channels to prevent possession altogether, but I'm not sure how this might be accomplished. Is there any link between diet/behaviour and energy channel strength perhaps? Or maybe would hatha yoga or something similar be effective? Any help is greatly appreciated, thanks!

"correlate" is a "stirring".
The term "mental image" feels like there already being some sort of "intuitive" (re-)cognition which is kind of "subtle" fabricating thought and is somewhere "in between" this "stirring" and full-fledged thought.

I get seasonal allergies if I'm in a part of the world that is new to me (contains pollen I'm not particularly accustomed to).  I grew up in Oregon, where there's no ragweed, and conifer trees overwhelmingly outnumber elms.  Here in Virginia, my face is definitely swollen and drippy.  Each year is less troublesome, though.

Does this phenomenon of becoming acclimated to an allergen over time and exposure sound reasonable from a Tibetan Medicine POV, or is there something else going on?

One senior monk I spoke to India visited a mountain and in his meditation he said he sensed them. He described them as goddesses who long ago had been present at the Buddha's teachings and being in their presence was an indescribable joy.

I don't think you'll find much more of an answer than that. You cannot go out into the mountains with a camera and hope to snap a photo of a deva.

Kind of mixing threads here but I found this conversation from the "Yidam and Dzogchen" thread to be really fascinating and I think it is relevant here.
Namdrol, in that thread you made this post:
"It is because buddhahood of lower yānas is incomplete and does not reach the stage of ka dag chen po, great original purity. The simplest way to explain it is that after the this universe dissolves and the next one arises, those beings who have not achieved the stage of ka dag chen po start all over."

Now, are both abhisambodhi and samyaksambodhi at the stage of kadag chenpo?
And also, since the primordial wisdoms, elements etc. are present in every sentient being and are fully integrated at this stage, how does one who attains this stage escape returning to samsara when this universe dissolves and a new one comes into being? Is it simply that kadag chenpo is beyond any and all implications of a "universe"?

If this were possible we would be able to break the chain of dependent origination at the point of contact (phassa), but according to D.O. craving gives rise to contact (via feeling) so basically we have a mental effect before the contact, ie contact itself is an outcome of mind.  I guess that makes direct perception out of the question.

This (if it is correct) gives rise to another question: without ignorance there is no perception?

Broadest range the Saddharmapundarika could have been composed in would be in the range of 100 BCE to 150-200 CE.

Right. But in some cases the laws of ones nation force citizens to do immoral and wrong deeds (conscription to fight wars is one example). Moreover, if a tyrant or evil party are in command of the state they derive power through a tax-base and the cooperation of the citizenry.

If your federal government is using your taxes to actively kill people in a foreign country to further corporate interests, are you not obligated to disobey the laws and refuse to financially support the government?

Malcolm wrote:
At this point, even so, you still have to follow the laws of the nation you live in. You may disagree with a given policy of one's nation, for example, but the only time it would be permissible to completely break with one's civil government is if they were so tyrannical they were not even providing any services to the people at large.

Now, for example, take the US Government, since that is who you are really talking about: tax revenues for 2010 were 2.16 trillion dollars. the federal deficit was 1.3 trillion dollars. Military spending is roughly eight hundred billion dollars a year.

This means basically that US government is not spending tax dollars to prosecute its wars around the world, it is borrowing money to prosecute its wars around the world.

This means that still people should pay their taxes and at the same time work to have a functional government that refuses to engage in the type of military adventurism we have seen since the Bush Administration.

It is simple numbers. Since the US Goverment still provides essential services, is not a complete tyranny (yet, though it seems with each year we keep sliding ever closer to fascism, no matter who is power, Repulican or Democrat, but this is largely because of the corporatocracy), US Citizens still need to pay their taxes as mandated in federal law from a Buddhist point of view. I am sure that Buddha would not have recommended that the subjects of Ajatasatru refuse to pay their taxes, for example.

Well, from a Vajrayāna perspective it is more subtle than that i.e. mind and body have the same relation as a flower and its scent. They are inseparable; without one, there is not the other.

The mind/body dualism is a sutrayāna thing.

In Vajrayāna mind (སེམས) and the vāyu (རླུང) are completely inseparable. In the teaching of Dzogpachenpo, not only are they inseparable, but Guru Rinpoche remarks to Yeshe Tsogyal that mind and vāyu are synonymous with one another. You can discover this by reading the མཁའ་འགྲོ་སྙིང་ཐིག་རྒྱབ་ཆོས.

Is a citizen really morally obligated to pay taxes and/or cooperate with a government they feel is largely corrupt and/or committing evil?

One example that comes to mind is that if your government is waging an unjust war and you are a proponent of ahimsa (non-violence), are you not obligated to refuse paying taxes as those taxes would be used to support ongoing violent military operations?

I think from a Buddhist perspective this can get interesting because of the historical precedents between governments and the sangha in many different nations in various time periods.

In any case, as an individual how do you feel?

This means that clinging cannot be a direct experiences in any way, since clinging itself is a conceptual state produced through "fabricating, synthesizing thought". Direct perceptions are completely non-conceptual. The remedy to clinging therefore is recognizing the object clung to, as well as the clinging, and the clinger to be empty of identity. This recognition in turn leads to the cessation of clinging through the direct perception of the absence of identity in the tricakram, the three wheels.

One can however directly know that one is engaged in clinging. But clinging itself is fabricated, synthesized state that occurs through ignorance of identitylessness. One can cling to existence (appearance) or non-existence (disappearance) -- the middle way is realizing that in reality phenomena neither appear nor disappear, but are wholly constructed through, in your words, "fabricating, synthesizing thought".

What it all boils down to, in the end, is accepting and rejecting. The narrow path through the Scylla and Charybdis of accepting and rejecting, existence and non-existence, etc., is the realization of inseparable dependent origination and emptiness. There is no other path, no other middle way than this.

This is our dissent. I say that it is "attachment" (or "clinging") that can be directly experienced but you prefer "thinking about" and infer "it must be existence that is 'felt' and that causes the clinging". I consider this to be philosophical fabrication deviating from direct experience and leading to further deviating fabrications and ... to "the thicket of views".


Kind regards


Malcolm wrote:
You seem to be clinging tightly to a thicket of views in an attempt to avoid that thicket.

"It exists", "it does not exist" is an ingrained habitual imputation -- that is a view,that is also a thought. Apart from these two views, there are no other views since all views can be summarized into these two positions or thoughts.

The ingrained habitual imputation "It exists" or "it does not exist" is the cause of clinging or attachment. There is no existence to be "felt". Existence/non-existence is an imputation that lacks a basis.

From another perspective, clinging can never be an unmediated experience since it is following craving, which follow sensation. When there is no craving, there can be no clinging. When there is craving, this is accompanied by the thought, "I want this", "I don't want that".

A sensation on the other hand, does not necessarily involve clinging since sense consciousnesses are wholly non-conceptual, and and their object is in the present moment. Clinging is an operation of the manas, and therefore, constantly involved with past moments of sense perception. Hence clinging is a wholly conceptual state, divorced from non-conceptual sense cognitions, based on craving. Craving is also function of manas, and is also supported on a past object, the object of sensation produced during contact.

So, while it is possible to experience an attachment directly that experience is based on a thought, divorced from the sense percept of that object of attachments. Attachment therefore, cannot be direct experiences, although they themselves can be directly experiences as mental objects.

There is no such a thing as "without clinging in the first place" because sentient beings, in the first place, appropriate aggregates based on clinging to aggregates they apprehend as existent.

In order to be free from clinging to these addictive aggregates (all conditioned appearances, both mental and physical) apprehended as existent, one must learn to see these as aggregates of empty of identity and whatever pertains to an identity. When one has seen that the aggregates are empty of a identity and whatever pertains to an identity, at that point, and at that point alone, will one be "without clinging". Without seeing the absence of identity of apparent phenomena, there is no way in which one can be free from clinging.

In other words, without eradicating the afflictions (moha, rāga, dveśa) that drive the cycle of samsara, one will never eliminate the instantiation of affliction called "clinging". Without seeing the emptiness of phenomena i.e. their absence of identity, one will never eradicate the afflictions.

There is no emptiness, nor any ”structural relationship”. In counterpart to Form, to the universe, we  have emptiness or voidness, which is Nothing, because the world is Everything that appears to be. It is the absence of everything, which is Nothing at all, that implies its positive aspect, so that Nothing, being that which is not, is also that which appears to be. Appearance, that which appears to be, is nothing in itself, because it can only be apparent, as such, when implied as being counterpart to nothing, which is not.

Objects have no objective qualities. Any perceived attribute is all it is as an object. Its attributes and its objectivity are identical, they are two side of the same coin. Its objectivity is therefore only an appearance, since all it is, is whatever we perceive it to be (the qualities, attributes).

The notion that the earth is round is essentially no different than the notion that the world is flat. Neither has any existence as objects, since the perceived qualities (shapes, substances, etc) are identical with its appearances. We cannot separate the perceived roundness from the appearance of the earth, as such. Therefore no deductions or syllogisms can be made that would define it objectively, since all we have are separate qualities and attributes, concepts or dharmas. The object is a convention.

Nāgārjuna is mentioned by name as being from South India in the Lanka-avatara sūtra. Traditionally, this was held to be a prediction of Nāgārjuna by the Buddha -- western scholars of course tend to think this dates the Lanka's composition after the second century CE.

There a many many texts attributed to Nāgārjuna. It is likely that there were several Nāgārjunas, at least three, not to mention texts authored under his name.

But the collection of texts I mentioned above, the so-called collection of reasoning, as well as three or four praises he wrote, and the Ratnavali and Suhrleka are all certainly by one and the same author, and that person we call Nāgārjuna. His direct disciple, Aryadeva, wrote a supplement to the Mulamadhyamaka Karikas, called 400 Verses, as well as a couple of other minor pieces. These two authors works mentioned above form the core of the so called "Father and Son" Madhyamaka. These texts form the real core of Madhyamaka teachings.

Unfortunately, today most people read Nagarjuna through the lens of the four Tibetan schools, rather than reading Indian Madhyamaka authors themselves.

Tibetan Medicine asserts that the sense faculties are not active until the nineteenth week, well into the fifth month.

Some hold he would be, others hold he would not be.

Certainly, when the fetus is new, it possesses only three indriyas: consciousness, life force and the body. Lacking sensation indriyas, an abortion would cause no physical pain to the fetus since the five indriyas of sensation do not exist until the nidana of contact arises.

However, the consciousness of the fetus would again find itself in the bardo, where it will experience great suffering, etc.

But this does not mean that person has realized emptiness (that does not occur until the third vision). So these paths and stages named in Dzogchen just serve as metaphors. Thus Zhabkar states:

"Though these stages are individually divided  out of the apparent aspect
of the single stage (upon which there is no progress or training)
of the luminosity of the fundamental vidyā;
in reality, the stage of vidyā is single
but there is no need for specific training on causal stages
for obtaining the stage of Buddha Mahāvajradhara.
The manner of obtaining each stage through the stages
of the cause and result of the common vehicles,
likewise the stage obtained through the effort and practice
of creation and completion according to outer and inner secret mantra,
here do not exist as [stages] upon which to train or make progress.

In reality, all vehicles are included, and the paths and stages are complete
within the single stage of one’s pure vidyā."

Then there is the uncommon way Dzogchen explains these things, in which the basis and the result are different from that of the lower vehicles.

For example, in general, the nine yānas approach is to assert that all-basis is dharmakāya. In the special Dzogchen view, asserting that dharmakāya is the ālaya is a "Buddhist deviation". In Dzogchen, the ālaya is, as stated in the Mind Tantra of Vajrasattva:

The all-basis is the bardo of everything,
unconsciousness, unclear, and inexpressible.

The example for the ālaya is space. The example for the dharmakāya is celestial bodies.

So you see, it is really not so simple as proclaiming that the basis and the result are the same for all schools, only the result differs.

For example, the Samputa maintains there is a distinct different in omniscience between an eleventh and twelfth stage buddha, and a thirteenth stage Buddha. Related to this, Dzogchen refers to the 13-16 bhumis as those that "dwell in wisdom". Why? Because only 13th stage Vajradhara's on up understand that all appearances are the display of their own wisdom.

Most people think that Buddhahood is irrersible; Dzogchen on the other hand asserts that the buddhahood of the lower yanas is reverts into the basis, and only Dzogchen results in complete and irreversible buddhahood.

These are the kinds of things you discover when you read Vima Nyingthig, Khandro Nyingthig, Gongpa Zangthal, the Seventeen tantras and so on.

The later in Tibetan history you go, the more homogenized the presentation of the four schools becomes. When you exam the texts of the Pre-Sarma period, then you find Dzogchen is really very different from what was introduced from India during the time of Rinchen Zangpo onwards.

Dzogchen did not spread widely in India, neither did anuyoga. The main tantric teaching of India was Yoga Tantra/Mahayoga.

Many masters to not present whole picture of Dzogchen. HHDL's agenda, which I respect, is to bring harmony to all schools.

My interest is a little different -- I am interested in what makes Dzogchen so unique and so powerful. I know the difference between what is commonly stated as a nice political thing so Sakyas, Gelugpas and Sarma-oriented Kagyus  don't feel bad, and what the real teachings of Dzogchen say, but are not so publicized. I don't owe allegiance to any school. My interest these days in particular is solely anuyoga and Dzogchen teachings.

That being said, don't think that I consider Lamdre, etc., as lacking depth, efficacy, or profundity -- they are profound, interesting, and wonderful teachings. I just think Dzogchen is more profound, more efficacious, and deeper. This is just my opinion.

Of course it is like this. Still as Nyingma practitioner the main view I been thought is from the Nyinthik tradition. The way to practice Mahayoga that I been taught is to aim for the inseparable two stages, as for example taught by Karmey Khenpo in his commentary on the Mawey Senge sadhana, Brilliant light, from Tukdruk Barche Kunsel. There is also an other text from that Terma where Guru Rinpoche says that the practice of Dzogrim in this tradition should be Semde.

The two stage in this context combine Dzogchen view and Mahayoga means. This seems to me to be the same meaning as for example Mipham has in his commentary on the Guhyagharba, Luminous emptiness, where he condense the commentaries of Longchenpa and Rongzom Pandita on the Guhyaghrabha.

Actually, this is the system of three stages -- creation, completion, dzogchen.

So even if there are no two stages in Dzogchen, Dzogchen can be a part of the two stages in Mahayoga. This is a very practical and helpful approach but of course Dzogchen should also be practiced according to its own methods as a main path.

Yes, as I have said many times. So we are in agreement on two counts (finally, actually don't know that we disagreed really): one Mahayoga and Anuyoga take Dzogchen as result, Dzogchen can be approached this way.

Two, Dzogchen is an independent path with its own means.

Or there is a tantra called The Self-Arisen Great Perfection from the Kadag Rangjung Rangshar which states:

I demonstrated the definitive meaning, the self-originated primordial wisdom
for those of the best fortune. 
I demonstrated the Dharmas of the nine vehicles
for those of medium fortune.
I demonstrated the outer Dharma of the provisional meaning
for those with average fortune.

And there is an interesting text in the Gongpa Zangthal called The Mind Tantra of Vajrasattva which extensively differentiates the great perfection from the nine yanas. It begins:

Because the view of nyingma mahayoga is dzogchen. In other words, HYT is more or less dependent on Madhyamaka for its view. Mahayoga takes its view from Dzogchen, specifically the Dzogchen as presented in the Guhyagarbha tantra, exemplified in the rosary of views intimate instruction. The main difference between mahayoga in this respect, however, and Anuyoga, is that Mahayoga takes the Dzogchen to be the result (more like mahamudra as conceived in Sakya) as presented in the sems sde system. Anuyoga takes Dzogchen as the basis.

Still we have to distinguish that while ground mahāmudra of the Kagyu school and sems sde bear some similarities, they also end in Sems sde. It is the opinion of ChNN that the four yogas of mahāmudra were borrowed from sems sde by Gampopa, and certainly he was a Nyingma practitioner before he met Milarepa.

effort and striving toward a goal; it is the way to self-liberate that attachment.
What is set forth in this citation is not a direct relationship between mahayoga,
anuyoga, and atiyoga and the mother tantra, father tantra, and nondual tantra of the
new schools but is instead a simple analogy: Just as father tantra emphasizes the phase of
generation, and mother tantra, the phase of completion, mahayoga emphasizes the phase
of generation, anuyoga, the phase of completion, and so on.

I have never found such thing as "Dzogchen outside 9 yanas". All teachings of Buddhism are included in 9 yanas. For me all teachings of Buddhism should be taken as a whole.

Never mind all the various categorizations that one can do about the various Tantras, they can for sure look like a bad fit like Namdrol says. But once you achieved the ultimate result , who knows what your experience of the various Tantras are. After all, all these text are there just to make us realize what our confused mind really is, nothing else. It also occurred to me that, particularly in the Termas, everything is a bit mixed. Ati combined with Maha, Maha containing Ati instructions, Maha but the sadhana is Anu and so on. Also when Taklung Tsetrul Rinpoche gave the Lama Gondu he said "this is a wonderful and complete Terma. It contains complete instructions on the three inner Tantras and are not incomplete like other Termas. Some only contain a little piece of Maha or Anu or Ati, almost none are complete like this." That is also a perspective worth contemplating. But most Nyingthik tradition has Ngondro and Yidams, the 17 Tantras mention Yidams, Longchenpa added various Guru, Yidam and Dakini practices to the Vima and Khandro Nyingthik. Thinks are not as clear-cut as one would like in order to make everything fit in the ladder perspective of things. How about this thought: The nine yanas are not a ladder?

Ok but the basis is the basis.  All the Buddhist practices in the tantras are supposed to lead to the basis of the mind which is the Dharmakaya which is Buddhahood.  The fact that they use different terms doesn't mean that they are talking about a different ontological thing.

Malcolm wrote:
The basis for one system is not always the the basis for another system. For example, the basis in Dzogchen teachings is not the mind.

Dzogchen distinguishes various kinds of basis depending on whether we are talking about sems sde, klong sde or man ngag sde.

So in Dzogchen man ngag sde the basis is vidyā (rig pa), and not mind. Mind is an adventitious obscuration to be given up. As Longchenpa states in the Lama Yangthig:

"The essence of mind is the all-basis and the group of eight. The essence of vidyā is beyond the all-basis and the group of eight."

So you cannot be hasty and just lump everything together in a sort of a putanesca sauce of teachings.

Dzogchen is not easy. It is very subtle, and so hard to understand.

What the Sakyas do not accept that is the idea that someone who has not received the four empowerments is a suitable candidate for pointing out.

I am searching for citation. The citation I have in mind is one where he refers to Hevajra as an outer tantra.

I agree that in shing rta chen po, grub mtha' mdzod, he gives the division set forth by Rangjung Dorje of:

maha = father
anu = mother
non-dual = ati.

But it does not really follow if you analyze well even Nyingma mahayoga.

And yes, he also covers sarma and snying ma seperately -- however he does not present father, mother and non-dual tantra as equivalents with maha, anu and ati in the sarma section. He only presents this scheme in the rnyingma section of grub mtha' mdzod. You can check, sarma inner tantra section starts on 1095; nyingma inner tantra starts on 1110. He gives a citation from the seng ge rtsal rdzogs:

"Creation mahāyoga is like the basis of dharmas,
Agama anu yoga is like the path of dharmas, 
perfected atiyoga is like the result of dharmas."

But moreover, most of the tantras we normally consider mahayoga tantras, such as the eight pronouncements, Yamantaka, Hayagriva, Yangdag, etc. are listed by Longchenpa as anuyoga tantras -- normally people are accustomed to thinking of these deities as Mahāyoga cycles.

Another feature that Longchenpa mentions is that creation is present in Anuyoga, but deemphasized. This is not the case with mother tantra in HYT. He mentions none of the root tantras one might expect for Mahāyoga, namely Guhyagarbha, etc.

And of course he states that in Dzogchen, there is no creation stage whatsoever, pg. 1121:

"The essence of the dhātu of luminous natural great perfection is self-originated wisdom. Here, since there no cause and result of an object to create or an agent creating along with conditions, it has always existed [ye nas yod pa] as nature like space."

Moreover, we cannot consider this similar in anyway to the non-dual tantras of Hevajra because on page 1122 Longchenpa explicitly rejects that in Dzogchen there is any cause and result or that the basis can made into a path:

"Since there is no cause and result in the essence [ngo bo, svarūpa), it cannot be determined to be samsara or nirvana at all. Since whatever arises is made into a basis, that which is the wide open space of the dhātu and wisdom, or the source or foundation of all phenomena, is the basis. The lower vehicles that engage in effort, practice, accepting, rejecting deviate through dualities and are obscured. Further, if is claimed that "...since the basis is made into a path, it is a path"; since the basis is uncontrived and unaltered, it cannot be made into a mere thing, the basis cannot be made into a path, thus a basis and a path are in contradiction..."

In Vajrayana in general, the basis, which consists of the five aggregates, five sense objects, and so on are made into the path. In Dzogchen, the basis i.e.the uncontrived nature of the mind that is like space, to paraphrase Longchenpa, does not need fabrication or alteration -- creation and completion conceived in the HYT system are precisely alterations. So one can never say that non-dual tantra in sarma schools are equivalent with Dzogchen.

In general, such formulas lead to more confusion than clarity since they are badly misunderstood, in my opinion.

three: there is no explanation of the basis that corresponds with Dzogchen teachings in Anuttarayoga tantra. But this explanation does exist in Anuyoga.

For example, I practiced Hevajra for many years. This is considered one of the two "non-dual tantra", the other is Kalacakra.

I can assure you, there is no atiyoga in the Hevajra systems extant in the world today (who knows what is in the Hevajra in 500,000 lines). Hevajra is based completely on the two stages. Of course there are some statements in the Hevajra which resemble statements in Sem sde. Certainly Hevajra is the basis of the idea of sahaja, certainly the final goal of Hevajra is mahāmudra, and there is no doubt that Hevajra is profound. But, I have some expertise in this tantra, I also know Dzogchen pretty well. Saying that the non-dual tantras equal atiyoga is really a stretch; there is no anuyoga in it, let along atiyoga. But it is a nice politic thing to say which makes people in the new translation schools feel better.

I think you are referring the klong gsal nyi ma 'bar ma rgyud. This tantras has a fully articulated preliminaries etc., up to thogal, and is mentions  Hayagriva/Vajrayogini for the deity. It is the root tantra for which the Khandro Nyinthig is the main commentary.

I have seen mention of Vajravarahi pratice in the commentary of sgra thal gyur attributed to Vimalamitra, but there is no deity yoga practice per se, as far as I am aware, in any of the standard seventeen tantras.

As for the Vima Nyinthig, again there is no explicitly mentioned deity practice that I have noticed, but I have not read all of it. Of course, one might consider the three roots in Lama Yangthig as connected.

Generally however, the deity retreats in these systems never amount to more than 7 days to 21 days.

"In the system of the New Schools, there are first of all the four tantras of Kriya Tantra, Charya Tantra, Yoga Tantra, and Anuttara Yoga Tantra. The fourth is divided into Father Anuttara Tantra, Mother Anuttara Tantra and Nondual Anuttara Tantra. This correspond exactly to the structure of the Old School, Nyingma, in that father tantra of Anuttara is Mahayoga, mother tantra is Anu yoga and the nondual tantra is Ati Yoga, [Dzogchen].


Malcolm wrote:
This quite arguable. Chogyal Namkhai Norbu explains that this equation of the three inner tantras with father, mother and non-dual tantra was a political gesture. He definitely does not agree with this sort of statement.

The fact is that Longchenpa, etc. all treat HYT as "outer tantra".

Animal husbandry is a form of slavery.  Gone are the days when "good Christian" owners of human slaves could justify human slavery on the grounds that they treated their slaves well.  As Buddhists, we consider all sentient beings to be of equal value.  It follows that, if keeping human slaves, however well treated, is wrong, then so is the keeping of animal slaves.

The Avatamsaka sutra is not found in the rgyud sde of the Kangyur, I can assure you since I have access to several versions. There is a two volume collection at the end of the rgyud sde where all dharanis from both sutra and tantra are collected. The dharanis in the Avatamska are also found there.

The abhisheka mentioned in the Dasabhumi sutra and the Lanka-avatara is only bestowed upon tenth stage bodhisattvas. It is not a method that is taught for ordinary people.

These kinds of misconceptions have been put to bed by Indian tantric scholars 1200 years ago. Tripitikamala is one person you should read to understand the difference between sutra and tantras, as well as many others.

Aemilius said:
You should read Lankavatara Sutra Chapter 2.40 ;Two kinds Of Buddha's Sustaining Power (Adhisthana)

This subchapter is about two and half pages, the verse at its the end goes:
163.The sustaining power is purified by the Buddhas'  vows; in the baptism, Samadhis,etc., from the first to the tenth stage, the bodhisattvas are in the embrace of the Buddhas.

"Baptism" means abhisheka, obviously.
This means that Bodhisattvas are conferred the Buddhas' sustaining power through their whole career, not just on the 10th Bhumi.

"By the power of the Buddha" occurs repeatedly through the  Avatamsaka Sutra. It must be the same Adhisthana that is discussed in Lankavatara?

Adhisthana is also present in Diamond Sutra when  it says that "Tathagata blesses bodhisattva-mahasattvas with the greatest of blessings"

I personally agree: also, I’d like to notice that not even one of the Indian commentaries has been translated in its entirety. There are a few:

The Akutobhaya, which is concise and ascribed to Nāgārjuna himself by some traditions; even if one does not accept it as an auto-commentary, it remains the oldest available commentary on the text;

Buddhapālita’s commentary;

Bhāvaviveka’s commentary;

Candrakīrti’s commentary.

If I am not mistaken, there is also a commentary by Sthiramati, the great Yogācāra commentator.

Hopefully in the next years some of these crucial commentaries will be translated. I am familiar with only one of them, Candrakīrti’s own, and I can say it is truly remarkable in pointing out the connections between the MMK and a very broad literature, spanning from non-Mahaayaana Suutras, to different schools of Abhidharma, and so forth. I trust that most traditional commentary share the same familiarity with the broader context of the root text.

What it means is that the methods of Dzogchen are completely different than the methods of the two stages.

The two stages are always involved with trying to discover something with the mind, peeling away the layers of one's body, speech and mind trying to reveal its most subtle nature.

With Dzogchen practice, you are working with that knowledge, the goal of the two stages, right from the beginning. This is why Dzogchen is referred to as the vehicle beyond cause and result.

Likewise, in sutra, you are always practicing and trying to discover emptiness. But in Vajrayāna, you work with that knowledge of emptiness right from the very beginning. Emptiness is the result, from the sutra point of view, so in Vajrayana one works with the principle of the result of sutra right from the beginning.

This highly experiential workshop will be led by Lama Migmar Tseten of Harvard University, and David Magone, the founder of PranaVayu Yoga. You will take part in a traditional Yantra Yoga initiation ceremony and learn to work directly with the body’s energy systems by using Yantra Yoga postures, breathing exercises, and mantras.

Yantra Yoga was traditionally considered a secret teaching, offered to initiates of Vajrayana Buddhism only after many years of intensive preparation and meditation. For this reason, it has rarely been offered in the West. Given the nature of these teachings, at least one full year of yoga experience is required to participate.
Is this practice taken out of Lam Dre?  Do you know if they will be going over or reviewing Kumbhaka (vase breathing)?


Malcolm wrote:
Yes, it is from Lamdre -- I translated the basic texts for this with Lama Migmar.

Yes, it has pranayāma. They should be going over khumbhaka.

These situations are problematic if people get stuck in them, and develop long-term confusions and attachments as a consequence (the confusion of thinking one is enlightened when one is really not, for instance).  I still think it would be better to work an honest job than to try to make an easy living selling phony Dharma.  But it may well be that, for some, there is no getting stuck:  they get started, read the fine print, and move on shortly after.  If you're in El Paso, Texas, say, you might spend a moment or two here...

Getting acquainted with Buddhist practice and Buddhist cultures can be tricky for many.  I'm speculating that a transitional phase might be useful, although I'm not comfortable with the profit/prophet motive behind some of these in-between groups.  I've seen this happen in Tendai-shu in North America, where people come in with a head full of ideas they've absorbed from different martial arts manuals and YouTube videos on Reiki and Instant Karma, which bridge the gap from Guy-On-The-Street-Mind to In-The-Know-Practitioner-Mind.

We know he freaked out "500" hundred Indian Panditas, headed up by Mañjuśrīmitra. Maybe there were two, the later one, Śrī Singha's teacher, was the reincarnation of the first, Garab Dorje's disciple.

The earliest bio we have of him, AFAIK, is in the Vima nyinthig, the lo rgyus chen mo.

As far as the rest goes, it is shrouded in legend and fable. It is all very uncertain. Norbu Rinpoche would like to place him circa 55 CE. based I think on the Sem sde lineages. There are all kinds of problems trying to date this person.

This is a pretty clear and pithy teaching on the Three Statements.

"A Dzogchen Master STARTS with "direct introduction" with everyone. If they don't "get it" then one starts to use all the infinite methods and means to help bring about the experience of Rigpa. When one has the experience of Rigpa, then one confirms the validity of one's path now being "remaining with Rigpa" as path. Then, one simply continues in that state. Rigpa is the view to be experienced, Rigpa is the path to be followed, and Rigpa is the fruit of the path. There is no change in Rigpa, either in the beginning, middle or end. The fruit is your first realization of Rigpa. There are no Stages of Rigpa. Thogel does not modify Rigpa."—Dudjom Rinpoche on the Three Statements of Garab Dorje

I would be quite hesitant to make proclamations about what the Dzogchen tantras say and do not say if you have not read them in a comprehensive way. I don't mean this is a mean way, or to suggest you are stupid -- I am not mean, and you are not stupid. But the real teaching of Garab Dorje is surprising in many ways. Not least of which is pretty constant refrain that the real meaning of Dzogchen cannot be approached through the nine yanas.

In the second approach, you use what you want/need from lower vehicles. In the first approach, each level is necessarily preceded by the earlier.

This point of view is not my fabrication.

It is pointless to talk about these things with people -- since people just stubbornly cling to whatever idea they start with, and get involved with trenchant disagreements that last for years. It is pretty stupid really. Better not to say anything and keep one's understanding to oneself.

Depends on what length of text you will be doing, also how familiar you are with the practice, could be from 20 min to 4 hours. Usually a lamdre teaching will give you the right and obligation to do three of '4 unbreakable' daily; people should consider this before receiving.

It's not really about three years retreat; it's a complete path leads to enlightenment; people are encouraged to do retreat but not necessary (depends on what you would be asked by your lama).

Malcolm wrote:
Sort of off topic-- but to answer the question: Dzogchen is a way of realization that is beyond cause and effect i.e. which does not require causal accumulations of merit and wisdom. It is not an ontological state beyond cause and effect. The reason that Dzogchen does not propose an ontological state is that since no phenomena at all are established in the basis, there are no ontological states at all, either existent or non-existent. In Dzogchen, the term "dependent origination" refers solely to the process initiated by the knowledge obscuration of avidyā which falsely imputes identity to person and things onto the appearance of the basis. Kadag and lhundrup may be understood as how non-afflictive or pre-afflictive processes in the basis are described in Dzogchen teachings.

In the general sense. The nidanas explain the dependent origination of kleshas. They are if you will, the special theory of dependent origination.

But what I am discussing here, and what Nāgārjuna is actually talking about generally is the general theory of dependent origination. It is for this reason he spends so much time discussion external phenomena such as the six causes and four conditions, the five elements, time, etc., as well as things like karma, four noble truths, etc.

All of these phenomena are dependent phenomena; all of these phenomena are also empty. To the extent they are empty, they are dependent; to the extent they are dependent, they are empty.

Does the quotation contradict my proposed answer?  If yes, please elaborate.

Namdrol said:
The inherent meaning of dependent origination is emptiness. Whatever is empty dependently arises; whatever dependently arises is empty, according to Nagarjuna.

In other words, there is nothing not empty that arises at all, and all that arises is empty because it dependently arises. There is no emptiness apart from dependent origination, and no dependent origination apart from emptiness.

Sherab said:
Doesn't "Whatever arises in dependence does not in truth arise" refer to the nonduality (inseparability) of dependent origination and emptiness?  In other words, the quote does not refer to the equality of emptiness and dependent origination and is instead referring to emptiness and dependent origination as "aspects" of the ultimate.  If so, the explanation given by you refers to just this nonduality (inseparability) isn't it?

Malcolm wrote:
The citation means that "empty" and "dependent" are completely interchangeable terms. It can be expressed as follows:

Something empty is something dependent;
something dependent is something empty;
something not-empty is something non-dependent;
something non-dependent is something not-empty.
The nature of the dependent is to be empty;
the nature of the empty is to be dependent;
the nature of the non-dependent is to be non-empty;
the nature of the non-empty is to be non-dependent.

In other words, dependent origination and śūnyatā are precisely the same thing.

No such thing as a failed introduction. The introduction is based on your experience. You will always have an experience in introduction even if it passes you by so quickly you cannot recognize it. This is why you work with this first.

Maybe you need some secondary practice, like two stages, tsalung, etc., or you have a problem an obstacle you need to remove.

However, you will not understand this very well talking to me or anyone else on the internet. This is not something that can be understood intellectual sans experience. It is like trying to explain to someone who has never encountered a lemon what a lemon tastes like. Even if you tell them it is sour, their "sour lemon" is just an intellectual concept.

What you need to do is go to a dzogchen master and do what they ask you to do. There are many styles of dzogchen masters out there. Some are not as "Dzogchen" as others even though they use the name "Dzogchen" to sell teachings.

Sorry if I misquoted you, but what would be the point of doing these practices if they don't lead to the recognition of rigpa? It is pretty clear to me that what makes you recognize your own nature is nothing but the accumulation of merit and wisdom. Without that accumulation it is impossible to even find your root Guru. Then after recognition it is still incredibly important because there are almost infinite ways of straying from the path, misunderstanding the path or just **** up.
There are so many Nyingthik cycles and Yangti cycle that contain all these practices, are you suggesting that Guru Rinpoche, Vimalamitra and so on was mistaken?

magnus,
the ambiguity is on "to lead to" ... when you view in term on linearity, you have to considere accumulation of merit. Because of that accumulation one come to a point of recognition of rig-pa. With that view, one may say accumulation of merit (yidam, ngondrö, or else and so on) "leads" to the recognition of rig-pa (Dzogchen). Once you have recognized rig-pa, "life change", and nothing "leads" to rig-pa, because the "practice" is only "no to" fall in ma-rigpa (which in "reality-fact" is totaly impossible). Of course, in that "space", when it is in the here and now, one can practice Yidam, ngondrö and so on, and it 'fit' energies, but even there, the practice is slightly different, there is no more "2 phases", but only one, the "immediate and spontaneous" completion one ... but then it is not "a lead", it's spontaneous and immediate.

What it means is that the methods of Dzogchen are completely different than the methods of the two stages.

With Dzogchen practice, you are working with that knowledge, the goal of the two stages, right from the beginning. This is why Dzogchen is referred to as the vehicle beyond cause and result.

Likewise, in sutra, you are always practicing and trying to discover emptiness. But in Vajrayāna, you work with that knowledge of emptiness right from the very beginning. Emptiness is the result, from the sutra point of view, so in Vajrayana one works with the principle of the result of sutra right from the beginning.

Yes, that is exactly how it can happen. Recently, in Australia, CHNN explicitly stated this to be the case.

This is why in Dzogchen there are many methods to work with -- different than sadhanas and deity yoga to be sure, but the principle is the same.

The terms of the two stages, you receive an empowerment: but if you do not attain awakening during the empowerment, then you have methods to reach that state.

Likewise, in Dzogchen, you have three transmissions: oral, symbolic and direct aka realization. If you do not experience realization on the basis of the oral and symbolic transmission right away, then there are many methods one can use to discover this state of realization.

I agree that "non-dual" is a bad translation of "Yer May," I thought the same thing when I read it.

Aside from appearances, what about the mind itself which "experiences" these appearances?  Does it differ from those appearances?


Malcolm wrote:
This is the great controversy about Yogacara. Asanga maintains that in order for there to be an appearance of deluded perception, even though the appearances do not exist, there must be an existent basis for those false appearances -- for example, even though there is no real existent image on the screen, there is nevertheless a projector through which a film is running. When the film is done, so are the images. Likewise, when the traces are finished, so is the false projections.

The real controversy is how far to extend that "existence" i.e. is the projector more real or less real than the projected images.

According to the way Yogacara is presented in orthodox tenet systems (Which all are based on Bhavaviveka II's Tarkajvala), this basis is the ālayavijñāna. When the seeds are removed, the ālaya is held to transform into wisdom. I.e. this existent wisdom which is ultimate, has to be predicated on an existing consciousness in order to account for the transformation of consciousness to wisdom.

In other words, conventional truth, in this way of presenting Yogacara, is the imputed projections. They all function, work quite well, until the basis of their reality is questioned. The ālaya projecting this is also understood to be relative. But when the traces are removed, the ālaya transforms into wisdom, and thus becomes ultimate.

Then there is the gzhan stong way of understanding this. According to the their presentation, both alāya and the projected images are conventional. Wisdom is ultimate and merely covered over by the conventional.

Then again, among gzhan stong pas, there are different ways of understanding the ultimate -- some seem to hold that it really exists. Others seem to hold it too is merely a yogic convention which when in equipoise is not needed and so on.

Namdrol, perhaps those who are "upset" with your "trivialization" of nonduality are referring to the term from this POV...what do you think?

I just happened to be reading Rigpa's Tibetan pocket calendar this morning..the Sakya lineage is featured this year, and Sogyal Rinpoche (or whoever wrote the content) claims the Sakya Philosophical View of "Khorday Yermay" is "the non-duality of Samsara and Nirvana," which "posits a non-dual luminosity-emptiness ("Saltong Yermay)  beyond all extremes."

Hi Muni-la:

What I am talking about is the fact that people think there is an ideal Buddhism somewhere. It is like a perfect form, unchanging, eternal, etc.

In reality Buddhism just reacts to people's circumstances. The Dharma is never completely taught, because people's conditions are endlessly various. And when someone becomes a Buddha, then for them Dharma is complete, since it has been realized.

The problem I am identifying is that Buddhism these days resembles a debate court, where people trot out obsolete problems (like how many sides an atom has) and then expend great deal of energy trying to disprove that atom. This amounts to disproving hair on a tortoise.

Now, I am not saying we should not study these things. But we need to study them with a view to their relevance. We know, through common observation, for example, that Vasubandhu's cosmology in the third chapter of Abhidharmakośa is wrong. This is not a mystery. We have known that it is wrong since at least 16th century, at least in the West. but still people are arguing about these things as if they are real.

I am not suggesting that we negate the two stages, toss out Dzogchen, etc. What I am suggesting however is that much of what is taught in Buddhism today are intellectual museum pieces that have no relevance to anyone's life.

There is always a role for historical scholarship, it can be interesting to learn how to debate like a monk in the fifteenth century. But we always must check the dharma that is being taught, and which we are learning, to see if it really has any value in our life.

Life is short and samsara is long.

Here is a short essay of Suniti K.Pathak, whose opinion is that has tantra existed from the earliest period of buddhism onward http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/bot/bot_1989_02_03.pdf


Namdrol said:
There is one important point in this you are missing. The earliest known text in India we know of that is referred to as a "tantra" is the Agniveśa tantra -- which is the core of the important ayurvedic treatise, the Caraka Samhita. The composition of the CS is hard to date, but likely was compiled between roughly 200 BCE -- 200 CE. Before there were distinct Buddhist texts called tantras, was another ayurvedic treatise called the Aṣtaṅgahridayasamhita penned by a Buddhist physician named Vagbhata in roughly the fifth century CE -- this text refers to itself as a tantra in the colophon.

Pathak's thesis is not that tantra existed in Buddhism from the beginning. His thesis is that elements existed in Buddhism from the beginning which are consistent with later developments called Vajrayāna. I don't disagree with this thesis. I think it is correct.

However, Vajrayāna is a mature path. Reciting a mantra to remove snake venom is not a path.

N

Aemilius said:
Suniti K. Pathak says more than that. It is intersting to see what  things he associates with tantrism, things that are present in our general view of early buddhism. The snake venom removing mantra is important because it is in Vinaya Vastu and it is connected to a known tantric deity !

Malcolm wrote:
The Vinaya Vastu is a complicated text. We cannot assume that its entire contents date from the time of the Buddha.

I prefer to interpret these instances differently. I think that there is an underlyingPan- Indian culture, based on vedic ritualism, cosmology and medical ideas, that people mistakenly term "tantrism". Buddhists were first and foremost Indian, and they utilized their culture in their practice of Buddhism. Proof of this for example may be found in the Mahaparinibbana sutta where Buddha informs Ananda that "the faithful brahmins" will take care of his cremation and so on, because they know the proper rituals for interring a Cakravartin. Or, in the beginning of the same sutta, he informs a minister of Ajasatru that it will be hard to invade the Koasalians, because among other things, they have maintained their traditional shrines and modes of worship.

All of this is not what we in Vajrayāna understand "tantra" to be. Of course we recognize that there are great similarities between non-Buddhist practice such as Shaivaite use of ganacakras, certain types of yoga, channels and cakras; secular practices such as royal coronation and so on. But just as the elements of Caitya or Stupa are all named after the ritual precinct of the Agnihotra, fire oblations, likewise, when these elements are taken up in the tantras they are repurposed if you will.

You can see seeds of this or that development in later Vajrayana in early Buddhism -- for example, the cult of Dharmapalas is present from the very beginning in the Dighanikāya, but the way these things exist in a piecemeal fashion in early Buddhism means that they are not a path.

Vajrayāna is a fully mature path, as opposed to the various miscellany found in various places. Also, even if Mahāmayuri is a deity in lower tantra, the practice of Mahāmayuri is also not a path. This deity is for temporary benefits, not for liberation. In lower tantra deities like Mañjuśri, Avalokiteśvara and Vajrapani are for complete realization. Lower tantra has hundreds of minor practices and mantras for various boons. Not many practices for complete realization.

So we either have to redefine what "tantric" means, specify what we mean when we are using the term "tantric" in terms of Buddhism, or restrict the definition to Vajrayāna Buddhism from the 7th century to the present in its various manifestations in Esoteric Buddhism of China and Japan and Vajrayāna in Tibet.

Title: The Problem With Buddhist Philosophy

Malcolm wrote:
The problem with Buddhist philosophy in general (I only really understood this after studying Tibetan Medicine) is that Buddhists often become stuck in dry, fixed categorizations. The way it is presented, there is very little engagement with process in Buddhist dharma language.

Dharma language is often quite presented overly taxonomical ways, and as such, people who indulge in Buddhist philosophy tend to resemble brittle taxidermists or dry intellectual morticians -- always trying to pretty up the cadavers of Buddhist tenets of which they are fond.

Buddhism is a living tradition -- not a bunch of tenet systems in a book. It is an evolving system, the sum of two and a half millennia of both awakened and unawakened people engaging with the meaning of Buddha's awakening, and the awakening of those who came after the Buddha.

Buddhism did not spring out fully formed, like Athena from Zeus' forehead. It evolved, slowly, adapting itself to time and place.

If Buddhism is to survive and continue to be relevant, it must evolve and meet the demand of those who are newly trying to engage with the meaning of awakening.

Otherwise, Buddhism is in danger of becoming a museum piece.

Short version: "Shang shog" or "shar shog", which means east in Classical Tibetan?

Long version: Take a look at pages 8 and 9 of the Chod practice on this page: http://www.zangthal.co.uk/files.html " onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;

As you can see, it translates "shar shog dor je khan dro me" as "The vajra dakini of the east" and "shang shog le kyi khan dro me" as "The karma dakini of the east". Surely one of these should read "north", right?

In contrast to this what is called "attachment" does have a correlate in direct experience. Consequently its absence has a correlate too. Therefore "non-attachment" applies, whereas "nonduality" or "emptiness (of what??)" do not apply but are mere fabrications.

So you have never experienced an empty bank account? An empty larder? Because certainly in this instant there is a correlate  with direct experience. The old "village is empty of a city, city is empty of a village" trope from the suttas i.e. the Cullasunnata sutta, major and minor.

Phenomena are by necessary of free of duality, since they originate in dependence. That absence of duality also has a correlate in direct experience -- see Kaccaayanagotto Sutta i.e. "Everything exists,' this is one extreme [view]; 'nothing exists,' this is the other extreme. Avoiding both extremes the Tathaagata teaches a doctrine of the middle".

The middle way view is by necessity a non-dual view, avoiding these extremes of dualism. That is also emptiness; emptiness cures the views of existence and non-existence -- that can be correlated in one's personal experience.

Apatheia, on the other hand, vairāga, non-attachment, is not a particularly unique Buddhist principle.

Well you have to remember that Buddha, according to Digha Nikāya, was the first human king of this eon in a past life...so yes, actually.

The problem is this -- Capitalism is a system where one cherishes oneself and develops mara-qualities. Bodhisattvas really ought not support such a system even if there is little they can do about it.

But if they have the chance, then they should try and act like Ashoka (after he figured out he was a mass murderer) Srongtsan Gampo, Trisrong De'utsan, etc.

Malcolm wrote:
There is one important point in this you are missing. The earliest known text in India we know of that is referred to as a "tantra" is the Agniveśa tantra -- which is the core of the important ayurvedic treatise, the Caraka Samhita. The composition of the CS is hard to date, but likely was compiled between roughly 200 BCE -- 200 CE. Before there were distinct Buddhist texts called tantras, was another ayurvedic treatise called the Aṣtaṅgahridayasamhita penned by a Buddhist physician named Vagbhata in roughly the fifth century CE -- this text refers to itself as a tantra in the colophon.

Pathak's thesis is not that tantra existed in Buddhism from the beginning. His thesis is that elements existed in Buddhism from the beginning which are consistent with later developments called Vajrayāna. I don't disagree with this thesis. I think it is correct.

However, Vajrayāna is a mature path. Reciting a mantra to remove snake venom is not a path.

Namdrol,

I don't think I am presenting any modern conventional Nyingma view, I am not a scholar at all, I just state what I see. The Vima Nyingthik is not free from the nine yanas according to what I have heard. To consider it free of the nine yanas you would have to weed out some parts, accept and reject to make it fit your view. So this subject about a "pure" Dzogchen free from the nine yanas feels very idealistic to me.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, you just go with what you understand, I will go with what I understand. Our understandings clearly differ. I am not going to abuse the teachings of dzogchen to "prove" my point by barraging you with citations that you will inevitably try to parse in a fashion according to however you see things.

So, this is the thing --there are some people who consider that there are two streams: one, outside the nine yānas; one, part of the nine yānas. Then there is another party -- they assert the whole of Dzogchen teachings belongs to the nine yānas.

I belong to the former group, you the latter. I respect your point of view, I just don't agree with it.

The inherent meaning of dependent origination is emptiness. Whatever is empty dependently arises; whatever dependently arises is empty, according to Nagarjuna.

Sherab said:
Getting back to the OP .... here's my proposed answer:

Emptiness is the label representing the inexpressible, the nature of the uncategorized ultimate.
Emptiness is also the label representing the expressible nature of the categorized ultimate, i.e. the no-nature of all phenomena.
Dependent origination is the label representing the expressible, the nature of the relative.

Therefore the inherent meaning of emptiness is not the inherent meaning of dependent origination.

The nonduality (or inseparability) of emptiness and dependent origination is the meaning of the ultimate.

On the contrary, emptiness is śūnya tā.

Anders Honore said:
sure, but in terms of meaning surely you are not saying there is an actual state of emptiness as the ultimate reality anymore than you would say there is a nondual state of ultimate reality?

Malcolm wrote:
The nice thing about śūnyatā is that you can stated that it is ultimate reality without committing oneself to an ontological position. Hence the tā suffix.

Three gates of liberation are a little different: śūnya, alakṣana, apranidhana, empty, without characteristics, without aspiration.

They are not states, they are entries. Emptiness is the bhutatā, the actual nature of the things. Also emptiness has no nature, since it is free from extremes.

This is the beauty of Madhyamaka. You can assert emptiness as a nature, and no one can fault you. If you assert non-duality as a nature you have already committed an epistemological blunder.

As Nagarjuna really said:

If I had a position, I would be at fault.
Since I alone have no position, I alone am free from fault.

It can hardly be said there is a philosophy of signlessness or wishlessness either. And arguably it is a great mistake to construct a philosophy from emptiness as well.

Malcolm wrote:
One can argue from the point of view of emptiness. One cannot argue from the point of view of non-duality and remain a Buddhist.


Anders Honore said:
And as regards Madhyamika, Nagarjuna (in the mahaprajnaparamitaupadesha) wrote of it:

Dharmas are included in non-duality (advayapatita), but although they are without duality, they are not, however, single. Seeing all dharmas in this way, without developing them in one’s mind or in one’s firmly held views, is what is called dharmakṣānti.

Malcolm wrote:
I doubt this text is by Nāgājruna.

Advaya-patita means "not broken into two parts", better to say, "...all phenomena are not divided into two, though they are not divided into two, they are not, however single".




Anders Honore said:
Finally, the Pou-eul-jou fa-men (Advayapraveśadharmaparyāya) or the ‘Teaching on the entry into nonduality’ [the chapter in the vimalakirti nirdesha] is the doorway to the true nature of dharmas (dharmāṇāṃ bhūtalakṣaṇa). Variety (nānātva) is duality (dvaya), and duality is wrong view (mithyādṛṣṭi). But the Buddha is not a deceiver (amāyāvin) and cannot commit a deception (māyā). He always applies the Teaching on the entry into non-duality, and deception is variety. That is why he has no notion of variety.

Malcolm wrote:
Better translation of the title would be the dharma discourse on entering the absence of dualism.

But the absence of dualism here is the dualism of "exists" and "does not exist".

Also the absence of the tā particle in Buddhist renderings of the term advaya is significant, even though usually over looked. "Tā" bears the meaning it "ity" in English, for example, reality. Non-duality means literally, "a state of being in which there is no dualism".

Emptiness is nondual, but it is not a nondual ity.


Anders Honore said:
I agree. I do think you may be a bit too eager to flush the baby out with the bathwater in the way you go about asserting this however.

The purpose of emptiness is to cure views. Emptiness is not a view. "Non-duality" is a view. That is why Vimalakirti kept his trap shut.

Anders Honore said:
The purpose of 'nonduality' is, of course, the very same. And equally so 'emptiness' can also amount to a view. As views, they both point to the same, an ineffable reality. The only difference really is that 'nonduality' says something more about how the mind tends to fabricate views, in patterns of opposite polarities. Like the three doors of liberation, 'nonduality' and 'emptiness' are just different aspects of the same fundamental approach - which is freedom from all views and extremes.


Malcolm wrote:
Emptiness is one of three doors of liberation; non-duality is not. The other two being lack of aspiration and the signless.

There is no philosophy of non-dualism in Buddhism. This is wholly the invention of western scholars. For example, Madhyamaka rarely uses the term "non-dual".

When it is used in Yogacara, it is meant to describe lack of a real subject and object in perception (vijñaptimatra), and hence the absence of existence and non-existence in those imagined phenomena as well.

It does not get used at all in the Nikaya schools.

I think westerners are over-invested in this word.

But a word that is frequently brought up, over and over again, is anutpāda, non-origination, non-arising. This word is much more important for we Buddhists.
