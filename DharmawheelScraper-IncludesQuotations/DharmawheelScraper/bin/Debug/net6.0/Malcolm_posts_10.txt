Too much atmospheric carbon dioxide makes some plant foods less nutrient-rich:

Dharmasherab said:
Likewise, a landmark study in 2018 found that growing rice in high-CO2 conditions makes it less nutritious. As a basic grain, rice plays a critical role in feeding the world’s population. The extra CO2 caused an imbalance within the crop’s chemical makeup, which resulted in rice that had lower amounts of protein, iron, zinc, and B-vitamins. “The entire elemental balance is out of whack,” explained plant physiologist Lewis Ziska, an author of the study. This result is yet another example of how the recipe of nature is being disrupted by excess CO2.

In addition to ignoring the long-term outlook, he says, many skeptics also fail to mention the potentially most harmful outcome of rising atmospheric CO2 on vegetation: climate change itself. Its negative consequences—such as drought and heat stress—would likely overwhelm any direct benefits that rising CO2 might offer plant life. “It’s not appropriate to look at the CO2 fertilization effect in isolation,” he says. “You can have positive and negative things going at once, and it’s the net balance that matters.” So although there is a basic truth to skeptics’ claim, he says, “what’s missing from that argument is that it’s not the whole picture.”

The problem with your point of view, is that by utterly withdrawing from your civic responsibilities, you are abdicating your responsibility to help the myriad sentient beings who cannot help themselves and protect themselves from our economic activity. It is as if you don't care at all about sentient beings because you do not care about the environment. So we are right where we started. You clearly don't care about the happiness and wellbeing of the myriads of sentient beings on this planet and see no reason at all to act to mitigate and reverse the present climate crisis we have caused as a species. Sadly, you have confused nihilism for Buddhadharma. You really need to work on that bodhicitta.

I guess I'm wondering about the experience through which one comes to this view. Owsley said this Alchemist book explained what he had experienced on LSD.

What are the errors in interpreting an experience that might lead to a conception of a Creator? We're not talking about someone with a https://youtu.be/i1Nh_3JCFj8 of God. I suppose its too much speculate about Owsley in particular, or anyone in particular.

The way I'm thinking about it now -

1. There is the error of assuming the subject-object dichotomy.
2. There is the error of assuming that some particular object is the fundamental source of one's own consciousness and that of all others.

Thinking out loud on the keyboard here.

Kim O'Hara said:
For as long as I've had an opinion on the matter (i.e. decades), I have believed that the "standard mystical experience" (unity of creation, floating in a sea of light, universal beneficence, etc) is pretty much universal, and independent of the experiencer's religious background; but that it is beyond words and afterwards, the experiencer needs to put it into words to try to communicate it - even, perhaps, to try to remember it.

Malcolm wrote:
Such descriptions are notably absent in Buddhist literature. One of things we learn right off of the bat in Buddhadharma, in all schools, is that experiences are transient and not very important. Realization, on the other hand is not transient and is very importantl.

Lucretius presents Epicurus’ chief achievement as the defeat of religio. Although this Latin word is correctly translated into English as ‘religion’, its literal meaning is ‘binding down’, and it therefore serves Lucretius as a term, not for all attitudes of reverence towards the divine, but for those which cow people’s spirits, rather than, as he thinks such attitudes should, elevate them to a joyful state of tranquility

This evening, Senate Majority Leader Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) announced that he would bring voting rights legislation to the Senate floor for debate—which Republicans have rejected—by avoiding a Republican filibuster through a complicated workaround. When the House and Senate disagree on a bill (which is almost always), they send it back and forth with revisions until they reach a final version. According to Democracy Docket, after it has gone back and forth three times, a motion to proceed on it cannot be filibustered. So, Democrats in the House are going to take a bill that has already hit the three-trip mark and substitute for that bill the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. They’ll pass the combined bill and send it to the Senate, where debate over it can’t be filibustered.

And so, Republican senators will have to explain to the people why they oppose what appear to be common-sense voting rules.

This is how Tibet lost their nation, by being passive and thinking that religious practices would fix everything. It didn't work then, it won't work now.

Chanting sutras, bowing to statues of the Buddha, and sitting in meditation never prevented an invasion or the overthrow of a government, as much as people like to fantasize to the contrary. It's like thinking one can heal illnesses with mantras alone, and forgo medical treatment with that idea in mind.

If we don't identify enemies to democracy, and respond to the threats they pose, we will lose our democracy. Our nation is in a precarious place. I hope you see this.

The same qualm applies to Kālacakra, the Lotus Sūtra, etc. However, in the case of the Sound Tantra, it is the definitive text of the system of Dzogchen, so regardless of whether one accepts its claims for itself, it occupies the most important position among all tantras of the great perfection, and thus cannot be ignored because it makes claims that text critical scholarship is likely to dismiss.  Text critical scholarship is limited by artifacts, physical objects, and inferences and deductions it can safely make on the basis of that evidence. So, it is limited.

Does the ecstatic experience have an analog in Buddhism? I can't imagine a yogini collapsing like St. Teresa.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, not in the Christian/Neo-platonic sense.

Certainly, some visionary experiences among Buddhists might be described as ecstatic. For example, Chetsun Senge Wangchuk's visionary encounters with Vimalamitra in the late eleventh century do not seem very ecstatic, since they consisted of instructions, nor Shangton's visionary encounter with Senge Wangchuk 60 years later for the same reason, but Khyentse Wangpo's visionary recollection of attaining rainbow body as Senge Wangchuk when he visited the site of Senge Wangchuk retreat place does seem to bear some aspect of what we would term ecstatic. He reports his experience of outer ordinary appearances dissolving into luminosity, and then recalling the experience of attaining rainbow body as Senge Wangchuk and so on. So, we might find ecstatic tendencies in the treasure tradition. Spontaneous visions of Padmasambhava, of Tsongkhapa, Sapan, Longchenpa, protectors, yidams, and so on might also be classifiable as ecstatic experience.

But these experiences do not form part of the normal path of a Buddhist nor are they considered particularly valuable in and of themselves since they are just mental phenomena. Though a person may find personal confirmation of their path in such experiences, they would rarely be communicated to others. Usually we only find out about such experiences in their inner and secret biographies and autobiographies.

Certainly trance shamanism, which is has never been completely abandoned in Buddhist countries from Tibet to Japan is ecstatic.

The question then becomes, how do I get started with Ati Yoga?

Is that Dzogchen?

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, and no, within Dzogchen itself, there are three divisions, mind, space, and intimate instruction series, and within the last, there are four cycles: outer, inner, secret, and utterly secret unsurpassed. Only the last is considered to be definitive.

Generally speaking the difference between Dzogchen and the nine vehicles is that the practice of the former is grounded in a direct experience of gnosis, whereas the practice of the latter is grounded in mind. Another way to put it is that the nine yanas are vehicles of cause and result, whereas Dzogchen is the vehicle which is beyond cause and result.

There are some similarities between Dzogchen mind series, Kagyu Mahamudra and Dogen’s Zen, and Chan in general, but there are also important differences.

In the nine yana scheme all sutric Buddhism is included in the shravaka, pratyekabuddha, and bodhisattva vehicles, which are the three vehicles of the cause.

From another point of view, Dzogchen is also part of what is termed Ekayana in common Mahayana.

Jesus anusmṛti, yes. But unlike Hinduism, which shares practices with Buddhism such as samādhi, dhyāna, dharāṇa, prāṇāyama, mantra and so on (and no, the Jesus prayer is NOT a mantra), these Abrahamic traditions share no such meditative traditions. Their contemplative traditions are mainly derived from Neoplatonism (which one can argue was itself influenced by Indian spiritual trends—Plotinus supposedly had a "gymnosophist" teacher); and Christian mysticism overall is generally ecstatic rather than "contemplative" in the sense that Buddhadharma understands samādhi and dhyāna.

This is a useful article outlining the dependence of Christian mysticism upon Neoplatonism:

Inge, W. R. “The Permanent Influence of Neoplatonism upon Christianity.” The American Journal of Theology 4, no. 2 (1900): 328–44. http://www.jstor.org/stable/3153114.

It shows very clearly that what we know as Christian Mysticism is directly founded upon Plotinus, via Augustine. We can see the ecstatic aspect in this passage Inge quotes from the Confessions of St. Augustine:

"What is this light which now and again breaks in upon me, and thrills through my heart without a wound? I tremble and I burn: I tremble, because I am unlike Him; I burn because I am like Him. It is Wisdom, Wisdom's own self, which thus shines upon me."

This fellow addresses all the great Christian mystics, including Eckhardt, Böhme, and Bruno, concluding with the Cambridge Platonists and their horror at Hobbe's revival of Epicureanism.

No one here is saying that all Christians in America subscribe to these beliefs, but there are sufficient number of them who do subscribe to these beliefs to represent an actual threat to American Democracy.

Shinran was exposed to Vajrayāna, and since in Japan it was an elite practice, complicated, hard to study, etc., his attitude toward Japanese Mantrayāna is understandable. But his attitude is situated in his culture and does not apply to streams of Vajrayāna outside of his experience.

There is however a certain egalitarianism in Kamakura developments. All of them, including Soto Zen, were inclusive of anyone who wanted to participate. Dogen encouraged lay participation (and did not buy into the whole Mappo thing at all); Honen and Shinran crafted a Buddhism for the masses which relieved many people of samsaric anxiety aboiut their future lives; Nichiren, very much influenced by Vajrayāna ideas, created a whole school around devotion to the Lotus Sūtra, asserting that people could exclusively attain awakening in this very lifetime by chanting the title of the Lotus Sutra and so on.

Sino-Japanese Buddhism evolved outside the Indian Buddhist University system, and owes very little to developments in India after the 6th century, beyond the very restricted influences of Mantrayāna that was introduced to China in the late 7th century.

We have to deal with the fact they consider themselves Christian and theologically justify their beliefs, just as do intolerant  Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, Hindus and so on.

We share nothing in common with Christians, apart from valuing compassion. There is no valid refuge In Christianity, so apart from having a positive influence on more open-minded Christians, I don’t really see the point in such ecumenical exercises.

Evidence based medicine claims to be the paradigm for modern psychiatry. It represents proven treatments for defined diagnoses. But there are major problems with this position, starting with the fact that while they are superior to placebo, evidence based treatments too often are ineffective. It cannot be assumed that classifying psychopathology diagnostically is the best way to move forward. Established diagnostic entities, are as much wish as reality. They are the result of committee decisions so tentative that DSM III and IV refuse to use the term "diagnoses" in the diagnostic manual.

In the 1990s, the rise of evidence-based medicine cast doubt on the reliability of expert consensus. Since then, medicine has increasingly relied on systematic reviews, as developed by the evidence-based medicine movement, and advocated for their early incorporation in expert consensus efforts. With the partial exception of DSM-IV, such systematic evidence-based reviews have not been consistently integrated into the development of the DSMs, leaving their development out of step with the larger medical field.
Depakote is also a pretty serious drug with considerable side effects. Not to say it isn’t important in some circumstances, but plenty of people have successfully controlled their OCD without it.

So we're back to it being not a path of renunciation, which is what I've always thought.

Brunelleschi said:
No, I do not agree with this view.

What you have to remember is that Sutrayana and Vajrayana both share the same outlook on Samsara (the three sufferings). E.g., when in Vajrayana you do deity practice it is important to remember than both you and the deity share the same ground - dharmakaya. You and the deity are the same, but you are temporarily obscured by adventitious stains/temporary defilments. The deity meanwhile, is not.

In Sutrayana, generally the way is to avoid sense pleasures. In Vajrayana they are transformed. However, like I mention above the view on Samsara is the same.

Malcolm wrote:
Nevertheless, the PATHS are different. There are in general three types of paths: renunciation (Hinayāna, Common Mahāyāna), transformation (lower tantras, mahāyoga and anuyoga), and self-liberation (Ati, Mahāmudra).

The confusion arises because the word renunciation in English translates different terms in Tibetan. Renunciation as a path is termed "spangs (utkṣiptā) lam," literally "the path of discarding or giving up." Where as the idea of renunciation of samsara is niḥsaraṇa (nges par 'byung). So yes, all Buddhists paths are predicated on niḥsaraṇa, but not all Buddhists path are predicated on the idea of utkṣiptā.

It’s true that there is a great deal of metaphor employed in various classes of Buddhist literature, but it must be treated with care, it’s employment is generally not so obvious. For example, the nine classic examples of tathagatagarbha, understood incorrectly lead one directly to holding a nonBuddhist view of self. On the other hand there is a correct way to understand these examples, which actually lead one to a definitive understanding the absence of identity taught by the Buddha. However, most people take theses examples literally and so wind up holding wrong views.

We might as well say "really empty" or absolute empty which means we are just reaffirming what our critics say.

Unless by saying emptiness is also empty we are saying it is NOT empty, which is a suggestion that there is something, in which case, we're back in the sphere of argumentations.

And finally if we insist on; it is not something/anything, AND it is also not empty/nothing, but that empty is also empty, then aren't we just subjecting ourselves to absurdity and contradiction which delegitimizes our place in any serious intellectual/philosophical conversation?

From Sujato's recent post (Jan 7, 2021)
For the EBTs, on the other hand, it is precisely the five aggregates that are taken as self. Indeed, it seems as if they were originally developed as a scheme for classifying self theories. If you had tried to argue, “What you take as self is nothing more than the aggregates” you would be met with, “Yes, exactly, that is my self.”

Everyone who comes later, including Bonpos, are not even building on Longchenpa's work, it is so definitive. At best they just summarize and simplifying what he covers extensively.

In this case it means a bstan 'dzin, a śāsanadhara. The actual name of the Buddha's teaching is śāsana. A śāsanadhara is one who "holds the teaching." There is a gap in the prediction in the Sound Tantra of the holders of the Dzogchen teaching between Longchenpa and the ḍākini mentioned above. Recently, Khenchen Namdrol mentioned this, apologizing slightly while stating that even tertons cannot be considered "holders of the Dzogchen teaching" in the sense mentioned above. Of course everyone who has received Dzogchen teachings is a brgyud 'dzin, paraṃparādhara, or holder of the lineage in a minor sense.

But in reality, what I mean is that no one other than Longchenpa could have written his treasures, with all his finesse and mastery of the seventeen tantras and their commentaries, not to mention the whole of Buddhist scholarship. There has been no Tibetan like him since he passed away in the middle of the 14th century. I am not talking about realization. Thousands of Tibetans have realized Dzogchen teachings to the highest level. I am talking about true mastery expressed for the benefit of sentient beings, and frankly, no one compares to him. Chogyal Namkhai Norbu himself said that among Tibetans, Longchenpa is the final word on Dzogchen.

Dharmatā is a complicated technical term, used in many contexts. It is usually contrasted with dharmin. In short, in the context it is used in Buddhapalita is illustrated in one case in this way. Take this passage, which is a very minor point, but I would do it differently:

།དེ་བཞིན་དུ་གཞན་ནས་ཀྱང་འདུས་བྱས་དེ་ནི་སླུ་བའི་ཆོས་ཀྱང་ཡིན། དེ་ནི་རབ་ཏུ་འཇིག་པའི་ཆོས་ཀྱང་ཡིན་ནོ་ཞེས་འདུ་བྱེད་ཐམས་ཅད་སླུ་བའི་ཆོས་ཅན་ཡིན་

Furthermore, he also declared in another [sūtra]:

Conditioned states are also deceptive phenomena. They are also phenomena that fully distintegrate.

This states that all formations are deceptive phenomena. Since all formations are deceptive phenomena, therefore, all of them are false.

I would have rendered this passage in this way:

In the same way, elsewhere [he stated] that all formations are deceptive phenomena (dharmin), "The compounded are also deceptive phenomena (dharma), and they are also phenomena that totally perish." Therefore, since all formations have deceptive natures (dharmatā), all are false.

Otherwise, his translation is just fine.

It depends on how one is approaching Dzogchen, as a school or a vehicle. If approached as vehicle, than the name, Buddhist or Bon does not matter much, not to mention, Nyingma etc. If one approaches it from the point of view of school, then Dzogchen becomes limited by sectarian considerations.

The ones who will take on Western students.
The ones who are part of a legitimate lineage.
The ones who have reached completion. (I realise this one is speculative)

Thanks for your help.

In the Indian and Tibetan understanding of the elements, were they meant to be literally taken as the 5 literal elements (like the body is literally made out of fire, water, etc.) or more their "essences" (like the Aristotelians and Medievalists with a "fiery property" of a plant making it rise, the "earthy property" of objects making them fall down, etc.)?

Malcolm wrote:
According to the Indian Buddhist, and later Tibetan ideas of the elements, all matter is made up of the four elements in differing proportions. The four elements never exist as differentiated substances, they are properties of matter——solidity (earth), liquidity (water), heat (fire), and motility (air)——according to the Kośa. The most extensive Buddhist teachings on the elements is in Dzogchen.

Then, he taught the third turning for 28 years, with various sūtras of both provisional and definitive import. So, he divides the Buddha's teaching into three periods.

Malcolm wrote:
It is purely a matter of faith.

Aemilius said:
There are hundreds, thousands or hundred thousands and millions of people who have practiced various spiritual disciplines and have attained the capabilities of seeing with the celestial eye (divya chakshu) or hearing with the celestial ear (divya shrotra) or seeing the past lives or future lives (purvanivasanusmriti). This is factual evidence for the phenomenon of extra sensory perception.

Malcolm wrote:
No, there is no evidence whatsoever, since there is no empirical evidence of such capacities among human beings at all. There are only anecdotal claims. Anyone can claim anything about such abilities, but since no one can verify their claims, such claims do not form proofs of any sort. Such claims merely form narratives, which some people adopt and other people ignore. Then of course there are some people that are completely bereft of common sense and reason who still insist the earth is flat, that the sun and moon rotate around Mt. Meru, and so on, using arguments that sound just like Roman Inquisition, who convicted Galileo of heresy:

Aemilius said:
In February 1616, an Inquisitorial commission declared heliocentrism to be "foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture". The Inquisition found that the idea of the Earth's movement "receives the same judgement in philosophy and ... in regard to theological truth it is at least erroneous in faith"

Malcolm wrote:
Not so. There is also a lack of ability to test such claims, since such claims could only be verified by people with similar faculties, and not by people lacking them. This requires that people who lack such faculties accept on faith the claims of people who claim to possess such faculties, since the former cannot verify the claims of the latter at all, as you admit below, and the latter can never prove their claims to the former, which is something you overlook.

Aemilius said:
We would quite certainly get results in this field, if equal amount of money  was spent in this field, as is spent in the construction of particle accelerators and other gadgets of that kind.

Malcolm wrote:
Probably not, since one could not create a proper double-blind study, and so on, to test such claims. And we already know, according to the Abhidharmakośa and so on, that beings in a lower realm are incapable of perceiving those in higher realms, absent some special power, which cannot be reliable reproduced.

Aemilius said:
There is knowledge that is not accepted by the great multitudes, and it is still knowledge.  Buddha speaks of the Arhats or Aryas that are above the great multitudes of people. They are like someone who has climbed on a great mountain peak and can see far from it. They can see what the ordinary people and the vast multitudes on the plains cannot see.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, and so ordinary people, those not blinded by religion, generally don't accept things they cannot personally verify, either through direct perception or inference. And it is certainly the case that one's liberation does not hinge upon whether one accepts or rejects Meru cosmology and so on.

No, he collated it from two different source texts, as the 1979 colophon clearly states:

ston mchod thub pa'i dbang po'i ma 'ongs lung bstan 'di la yi ge 'dra min gnyis snang yang...

Literally, "Though this prediction by the supreme teacher, the powerful Muni, appears in two different texts..."

In fact, the introduction to the four volume set of predictions published by Palyul (lung bstan phyogs btus/. TBRC W3CN532. 4 vols. dpal yul rdzong /: dpal ya chen o rgyan bsam gtan gling /, [n.d.]. http://tbrc.org/link?RID=W3CN532 ) states on page 1:

Here, though the mother text of this prediction of the future that originates in sūtra was found in Ngari in the past, because its origin was unknown, it was neglected for some time. Later, the mother text was found in a collection of prediction texts at Rahor, Trakgo Dzongtsang, with slightly different wording. Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodo collected these (phyogs bsdus mdzad) in India...

Then this introduction just goes on to say it was published in Delhi in 1979, etc. And also it adds that as the later mother text (the one from Rahor) was thought to be uncorrupted, this is the version presented in the Karma Kagyu publication.

Thus, it is most definitely not a modern text, it is most definitely not a terma, and it is most definitely one of two witnesses—one from Ngari in western Tibet, one from Rahor, in Kham—collected, but not revealed, by Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodo.

So..."nirgunam tattvahinam" space - devoid of qualities and apart from reality - is compounded space?

Malcolm wrote:
Actually, according to the commentary by Lama Dampa (who composed the most extensive Tibetan commentary on the text), it refers to a void with lacks qualities. Hinam in this context refers to the ordinary five elements, tattva refers to the principle (tattvahinam, de nyid kyis dman pa'o) which is the single void (stong pa gcig pu) that pervades the five elements, so it is not space at all in the normal sense of the term. So this translation you are relying on is also slightly incorrect. It should be something like:

Outside that is the single void, separate from the three realms, the principle devoid of qualities that [pervades] the inferior [elements].

Ode to Joy said:
Thanks for that citation it's interesting.  The whole topic is difficult to think about I'm still not clear on the difference between ordinary space and the single void.  If a single void pervades even the akasha dhatu does that mean something is being pervaded and what could that thing be?  Otherwise it would be space pervading space which sounds counterintuitive.  What is the exact difference between the single void and the ordinary akasha element  - is there a difference?  Maybe this is why you find the word aether to distinguish it from "the principle devoid of qualities that pervades the inferior elements" because people are trying to comprehend space pervaded by space.

Malcolm wrote:
The commentary makes it clear that this single void is not the same as "space with qualities." Other than that, there is not much else on this point.

Basically, the quality of "formed" space is sound, whose particles correspond to taste, and who permeate the other four elements and provide space between objects. See Ornament of Stainless Light, Khedrup Norzang Gyatso, pg. 79, and page 87m ,where he discusses this passage specifically. He says this space, which is a dimension where the particles of the five elements are disconnected, is a "mere emptiness" or as I translated above, a void.

However, in both cases, their students referred to them as 'geshe-la', as s sign of respect, in recognition that the degree was something earned by hard work.

Are khenchen, khenpo and geshes monastics?

One way would be to ask, either the lama himself or someone in his entourage.

Geshe is an academic degree, like doctor of divinity.  In the old days, most geshes would have been monks.  That is less true nowadays.  I knew a couple of geshes who were lay people.  Both had been monks in the past, but had given up their robes when they moved to the West.  The geshe degree, of course, remains.

So..."nirgunam tattvahinam" space - devoid of qualities and apart from reality - is compounded space?

Malcolm wrote:
Actually, according to the commentary by Lama Dampa (who composed the most extensive Tibetan commentary on the text), it refers to a void with lacks qualities. Hinam in this context refers to the ordinary five elements, tattva refers to the principle (tattvahinam, de nyid kyis dman pa'o) which is the single void (stong pa gcig pu) that pervades the five elements, so it is not space at all in the normal sense of the term. So this translation you are relying on is also slightly incorrect. It should be something like:

Outside that is the single void, separate from the three realms, the principle devoid of qualities that [pervades] the inferior [elements].

There are no such teachings in Buddhadharma which contradict this. You can't name even one. For example, the Vajramāla Tantra states:

A mantra is not to be given
to a sentient being who has not received empowerment,
nor should the wise show an image
or a book to such a one.

Similar admonitions occur in Kālacakra, Abhidhānottaratantra, Mahāmudrātilaka, and so on. As far as practicing secret mantra goes without a proper teacher and empowerment, this is strictly prohibited for the same reason. The Mahāmudrātilaka states:

Whoever pridefully elucidates 
the tantras and upadeśas to one lacking empowerment
as soon as they die, both master and disciple
go to hell, even if siddhi is obtained.

And:

If one pleases the guru, the king of mantras
will doubtlessly be attained.
If it is not attained in that way, it is faulty,
and even if one receives a mantra, it will not be effective.

Even in lower tantras, it is the same, for example, the Vairocana-abhisambodhi states:

Without empowerment, the source of secret gnosis, 
there is no mantra.

And of course in the Tenjur, there are hundreds of such admonitions.

Space is not a mahabhuta, but it is a dhatu. Unconditioned space is considered “real” in the sense that it is a dharma, that’s all, along with the two cessations.

Kalacakra is an entirely different thing. It’s “particles of space” are compounded. But this idea has no relevance outside of the Kalacakra system,

Ode to Joy said:
The space-particles, specifically connected to the genesis of a new universe, are a different thing than what I was thinking of which is Kalacakra Tantra, chapter 1, verse 10 where it's stated:

"Outside of that, [the limit of wind to the border of wind], is the single void (shunyameka), separate from the three existences, without qualities and bereft of properties (nirgunam tattvahina)".

I am wondering if the space of this "nirgunam tattvahina" single void outside of our universe so specifically described here is the same as the space within the border of wind and border of Meru, the space for the continents, Meru, wheel of houses and stars.  In other words, is it akasha-dhatu?  Since the emphasis on lack of qualities and reality (Tattva) for this space is this meant to suggest that the space within our universe holds certain qualities and properties..such as those ascribed to "aether" in Veda and medieval West and that some people talk about today.  ( I understand that Abhidharma wouldnt support this idea).  Especially since importance is placed on the element of wind as the basis of the universe.  Does the wind element somehow condition the space element within samsara? This could have something to do with the Vedic theories and remember that in Kalacakra Buddha explains that he himself taught the 4 Vedas.

PeterC said:
This book is a translation and study of the Vajrasamadhi-Sutra and an examination of its broad implications for the development of East Asian Buddhism. The Vajrasamadhi-Sutra was traditionally assumed to have been translated from Sanskrit, but some modern scholars, principally in Japan, have proposed that it is instead an indigenous Chinese composition. In contrast to both of these views, Robert Buswell maintains it was written in Korea around A.D. 685 by a Korean adept affiliated with the East Mountain school of the nascent Chinese Ch’an tradition. He thus considers it to be the oldest work of Korean Ch’an (or Son, which in Japan became known as the Zen school), and the second-oldest work of the sinitic Ch’an tradition as a whole. Buswell makes his case for the scripture’s dating, authorship, and provenance by placing the sutra in the context of Buddhist doctrinal writings and early Ch’an literature in China and Korea. This approach leads him to an extensive analysis of the origins of Ch’an ideology in both countries and of the principal trends in the sinicization of Buddhism. Buddhism has typically been studied in terms of independent national traditions, but Buswell maintains that the history of religion in China, Korea, and Japan should be treated as a whole.

Suppose we lived in the world, where being a selfish greedy arsehole was never acceptable. Where people would get viscerally ill at just imagining themselves behaving in such a way. How would capitalism work in such a world?

Well, I think there are capitalists like that. There are companies in capitalist economies that are majority worker-owned. There are companies where employees are treated like family. It is possible to run an ethical and successful business, at least sometimes.

Sure, capitalism encourages the ruthless pursuit of profit. Milton Friedman taught that the sole responsibility was to the shareholders. So we can blame the system and rightly so. But at the end of the day, it is human beings taking advantage of the system in an unscrupulous unprincipled way. Or gradually coming to do so more and more, as is often the case.

But they don't all do so.

To use a crude analogy, capitalism is bad in the same way that guns are bad - both are bound to be misused. Well, in case of capitalism, this misuse isn't even considered to be misuse. So it's kinda worse. But basically capitalism needs control in the same way that guns need control, because human beings are bound to ride roughshod over their kind. That's something we should look at in a deeper, more creative way, not instead of changing the system, but as well as, IMO.

Malcolm wrote:
What you are referring to is European-styled Capitalism, aka Coordinated Market Economies, which trade growth for stability. The US—and to a lesser extent—England, Canada, Australia and New Zealand have liberal market economies, which trade stability for growth.

But the issue with international capitalism is that the watchdogs of it, the WTO, etc., almost always side with corporate interests over national interests, under the present neoliberal principles which govern it, and to which signatories of the treaty that gave birth to the WTO are bound by law to uphold. In other words, neoliberalism favors liberal market economics on an international scale, as opposed to coordinated market economics, something which underdeveloped economies, like India, and formerly, China, actually insist upon. There are no unions in China, for example.

Malcolm wrote:
It is nonobstruction, according to Buddhist texts. There is also relative space, which is any kind of empty cavity.

Ode to Joy said:
Thank you for that answer.  I understand about the idea of nonobstruction but I am curious if there is any other function of this element besides simple nonobstruction and how does it exactly get differentiated from the relative space you mentioned?  How is "akasha-dhatu" different from "infinite space" or unconditioned space?  In a way, the two concepts sound so similar I'm not clear what is the distinction.  For instance, is there any sense in Buddhism that the element akasha is similar to this Hindu definition found in the Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English lexicon:  "the subtle and ethereal fluid (supposed to fill and pervade the universe and to be the peculiar vehicle of life and of sound) per Vedanta"?  Or is the Buddhist concept not like the Vedanta philosphy.  Another interesting point is that Sanskrit akasha apparently comes from the root kAsh meaning "to shine, to appear, to be visible, to be brilliant" whence other common words like prakAsha.  Which points to something beyond vacuity or mere nonobstruction - not that the BUddhist texts have to be concerned with the etymology of the word of course, Im not suggesting that. But that root syllable gives the impression that akasha could be a medium for light to propagate - and again Im not suggesting that this has anything to do with Buddhist teachings.  Actually, the reason I even ask is because in Phillipe Cornu's book Tibetan Astrology, he specifically (at least, his translator from French) calls akasha as "aether", rather than "space".  In English, "aether" has a special meaning, quite different from "space" and I am curious as to whether Mr. Cornu had a particular reason for using this term.

And what do we make of this statement on the Wikipedia page of Akasha in the Buddhism section: "The Vaibhashika, an early school of Buddhist philosophy, hold the existence of akasha to be real"?  What does it mean to say that "akasha is real" and what would it mean to claim it is not real?

Queequeg said:
As of December 31, 2007, AIGFP had a portfolio of credit default swaps totaling $527 billion, of which $78 billion was written on multisector CDOs, most of which had some exposure to subprime mortgages. Indeed, it has become widely accepted that without ­Cassano and AIGFP around to insure the risk that Wall Street was taking in underwriting these increasingly squirrelly assets, the debt bubble might have run out of air far before it did in 2007. In its defense, which shows up, among other places, in an August 2009 court filing by law firm Weil, Gotshal & Manges in a shareholder lawsuit, AIG argues that it wrote credit default swaps on only the supersenior portion of the multisector CDOs — that is, those payments made first. Incredibly, AIGFP believed it had little real exposure “because the supersenior tranche has priority of payment ahead of even the AAA tranches, [and so] is regarded as having a better-than-AAA rating.”

Malcolm wrote:
And this also played a part:

Queequeg said:
While that last bit of legal spin is certainly debatable, what soon became crystal clear — and a major problem for AIG — was that as the value of the toxic securities it had insured before 2006 fell, AIG’s counterparties ratcheted up their demands for collateral. At the forefront of these increasingly strident collateral demands was none other than Goldman Sachs Group. Unlike every other Wall Street firm, in 2006, Goldman became nervous about the growing risks its traders perceived in the free-for-all that the market for mortgage-related securities had become. The traders’ concerns eventually bubbled up to the 30th floor of 85 Broad Street, where Goldman’s top executives had their offices, and in December 2006 the firm decided to “get closer to home,” in the words of CFO David Viniar. The firm started to make huge bets that the mortgage market would fall by shorting individual mortgage-backed securities and the newly created ABX index, which was a basket of mortgage-related securities, and by creating synthetic CDOs and selling the risk related to them to the likes of AIG.

There is nothing new here Dan. This just generational bitching, “kids these days.” Some kids find their direction in life early; some a bit later; some, never. And it’s the same in Japan and China.

For example, I was utterly bored in school. I had taught myself to read when I was a toddler. I generally finished reading my schoolbooks within the first month of school, and was often punished for reading other books in class. I was pretty much done with school by age 14, though between 15-17, I was sent to an alternative private school, from which I was expelled. I met Buddhism there, however. I drifted along for another ten years, working this shit job and that, until I attended Harvard extension, but never matriculated. I got a job in a bookstore, became a Buddhist, and drifted along into a three year retreat. After I got out, I drifted into a bad marriage, drifted out of that, and drifted back to Western Massachusetts about twenty years ago, where I had “grown up.” I’ve found a nice pool in the stream of my life, and the  current so far hasn’t pushed me out. I am a well—published translator, but I didn’t plan any of it. I didn’t “work” for it, or have any sense of purpose or mission. I still don’t, other than seeing a certain body of literature translated into English. So I don’t buy, for one minute, much of what you are trying to sell. It doesn’t fit my experience or observations.

One other thing: Black people get to use the Uncle Tom metaphor, you and I don’t. It’s racist to do so. And your use of it is incorrect:

Unknown said:
The first has to do with an erroneous interpretation of the novel. The original Uncle Tom is, well, no Uncle Tom. Like millions of his real-life counterparts at the time, Tom is enslaved. He also has courage, dignity and a strong sense of what is right. When ordered by his cruel master, Simon Legree, to whip another slave, Tom refuses; he later encourages two other slaves to escape, and when Legree confronts him, asking where they have gone, Tom refuses to reveal their whereabouts, a decision that costs him his life. Tom heartily (but not blindly) embraces Christianity, the religion of his white oppressors; but then so do most of the black Americans I know.

Maznevski says there are likely two broad categories of people participating in the Great Resignation: “One is people who are professionals, who are making a choice between ‘good’ and ‘better’. The other category is people who are making a choice between something that is really terrible, unhealthy and toxic, and survival. Those are two very different dynamics.”...


In other words, we may only be seeing the Great Resignation through the eyes of those who have the privilege to quit, like top executives or financially secure workers. But the reality is that it’s hard to parse from the existing data which workers are quitting more and why, which can distort what’s really happening, and might encourage people to boldly quit and think everything will work out for them.

Tibetan medicine is also not a static and unchanging entity. Promoting medical conservatism accomplishes nothing good

I believe I read a post by Malcolm once that Tibetan medicine has drawn upon influences from Galen and Ayurvedic medicine (and perhaps even Chinese?) as well as the indigenous medicines of Tibet. This makes perfect sense when we consider that medicine is primarily results-based and this has been a factor in all medical traditions (Western medicine drawing upon Islamic medicine etc.).

Point is, it would not be constructive for Tibetan medicine to reject anything it can learn from Western medicine. This should also not be taken to mean that Tibetan medicine is then obsolete. They are not mutually exclusive.

Malcolm wrote:
Tibetan Medicine is indeed derived from the medical traditions of the Byzantine Empire, China, and primarily, from Ayurveda, combined with indigenous herbal and healing traditions. It is also the case, as you point out, that Tibetan Medicine and Allopathic Medicine are not mutually exclusive. Tibetan Medicine, like Ayurveda, is excels in the treatment of chronic diseases, whereas Allopathic Medicine is much better equipped to deal with acute care, such as car accidents, cancer, and other types of conditions that require immediate intervention.

Other diseases those are successfully cure are AIDS, Brain Tumors, Multiple Sclerosis, Hepatitis, Leukemia, Stroke, Stomach Cancer."
You seem to be mistakenly thinking that “Science” doesn’t want to learn anything from traditional medicine.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  It’s a field that has been and is studied quite extensively for ideas on treatment of diseases. If someone had achieved a functional cure for AIDS there would be researchers all over it, since there’s so much research money in that field.  There are to date only two known cases of a functional cure for AIDS, and they hadn’t seen a Tibetan doctor.

However, I know one tibetan doctor, the Ven paltul rinpoche who told me he has been very effective in treating breast cancer using Tibetan medicine, he gets his medicine fresh from Tibet, and not from Men-tsee-khang in dharamsala.  He said though that the Tibetan medicine is effective if they had not yet gotten radiation, but if they had radiation therapy already it was less effective.

He has treated thousands of cancer patients from all over the world, including women with breast cancer The rate of survival for people treated with ancient Tibetan herbal therapies with or without adjunct Western cancer treatments appears to be much higher than those receiving allopathic cancer treatments alone.

Other diseases those are successfully cure are AIDS, Brain Tumors, Multiple Sclerosis, Hepatitis, Leukemia, Stroke, Stomach Cancer."

Well, then we are talking about two different things entirely. In any case, something conventionally is said to exist, if it functions according to expectations. For example, a car: a car that cannot drive is a non-car by definition, something we refer to as a "broken-down car." But even a broken-car is more of a car than Meru is a mountain. Sure, we can call Meru an mythical mountain, since it is myth. But it is not a real mountain, even conventionally speaking.

Malcolm wrote:
I agree with regard to the mythical mountain part. A car that cannot drive is neither necessarily a non-car nor a broken-down car. This underscores the importance of clear definitions. A lot of the issues with the photon situation are simply a lack of clear definitions for generations of particle physics.
I don't think physicists will agree you here.

Meru is a concept. It's a mental dharma.
So is the son of a barren women, but it is mental representation of a total nonexistent. It may have suchness in how it exists—as a concept—but not in what it represents, a total nonexistent.

Sonam Wangchug said:
it's not only that he is criticizing the wrong application of the practices, since he prefaces it with believe in science and do away with superstitious beliefs, so he is directly calling these profound skillful means left behind by Guru Rinpoche as superstitious and not effective.

Malcolm wrote:
He is criticizing motivation:

This may be an ancient tradition but certainly it is not a genuine Buddhist practice. Hoisting flags in the mountains with the hope of increasing one’s fortune is not a Buddhist aspiration. The main Buddhist principle is the law of cause and effect. Without accumulated merit from previous lives or without any genuine bodhicitta, there is no reason that by simply putting up prayer-flags in the mountaintops would bring one any good result

Again, here he is criticizing motivation for the same reason he is criticizing hoisting prayer flags for personal benefit.

In order to fool their patrons, fake monks and lamas these days make all kinds of terbums or treasure vases stuffed with various items claiming that these will enhance their wealth, life and luck and patrons are then made to buy them.

As for his embrace of science, well, Tibetans need to study the sciences so they can secure decent employment for themselves. Tibetans are among the most underemployed people in the PRC, primarily because of their illiteracy and lack of education. There is really nothing wrong in advocating that Tibetans get up to speed in the sciences. In Tibetan schools in India, physics, math, and so on are taught. No one but you has a problem with this. And yes, he is criticizing Tibetans for not following the Buddha's understanding of cause and effect and giving into superstitions. For example, he really criticized Tibetan doctors for charging for nagpo gujor pills, even though he thinks they are worthless for preventing rims nad like covid. He points out if those pills really had the proper amount of musk in them, if any at all, they would be selling for $50.00 a piece (300 rmb), an exorbitant price. Hence, he accused Tibetan doctors of profiting off the superstitions of Tibetans through selling them cheap, counterfeit nagpo gujor pills.



Sonam Wangchug said:
However,  masters who are capable of perceiving local deities, or diagnosing problems via divinations, like Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche, or Lama dawa rinpoche for example, can see that sometimes problems stem from unseen sources which require such spiritual solutions.

Malcolm wrote:
Such lamas are as rare as stars during the day.


Sonam Wangchug said:
Of course if one looks with a doubtful mind one can find flaws in any teacher, sutra, tantra, etc .. However for practitioners there is a different way of handling perceived inconsistencies with humility.

Although a prophecy may give a description of benefits, at the end of the day these still depend on the causes and conditions, so perhaps in ideal circumstances it would unfold as such, however depending on circumstances it depends. It still would bring nothing but benefit if done in the right way, and if we do not believe it, then we do not believe Guru Rinpoche, and that is I suppose ones right, but one thing is for sure Guru Rinpoche , and the methods he left behind, will never deceive anyone and are unfailing.

Malcolm wrote:
That depends on whether one accepts treasure teachings or not. I suspect Thubten Phuntsok is suspicious of treasure teachings, and more to the point, people who claim to be tertons. Tibetan history is littered with false tertons, and even some of the supposedly authentic ones are pretty dodgy characters who plagiarize whole texts from other schools, barely altering a single word, other than substituting Guru Rinpoche's name for the original Tibetan author.

Sonam Wangchug said:
I'm not really sure who started the tradition of throwing colored papers, or if it has any authentic history at all, possible that it doesn't. I've mainly only seen it happening with Khampas.

All Tibetans do it.

Sonam Wangchug said:
The problem with such writings and defense of them is as the end of the day it will only decrease peoples faith and devotion in the three jewels, and the root of all benefit comes from devotion. There are countless things we do in Vajrayana that to skeptics would be called nothing but superstition, are we going to start cow towing every time some modern mind gets a namtok? no.. we can truly trust our teachers. All this modern minded pujas don't really work and are superstitious jargon has to go. Pujas when performed correctly can bring tremendous benefit and are not 'superstitions' as the author claims.

Sonam Wangchug said:
just think of how many compositions of various masters there are on methods of life release, prayer flags, lung ta etc (khyentse wangpo, mipham etc) .. These were not deluded beings, they compose these works because they bring great benefit to sentient beings, so let's instead argue for their continued "correct" application, as they were intended.

Malcolm wrote:
Thubten Phuntsok is arguing for their correct application, apart from prayer flags, which are just a pre-Buddhist custom in Tibet, as everyone knows:

On prayer flags:

Throwing up papers printed with mani and other mantras everywhere has two negative consequences – from the religious point of view it shows disrespect to the mantras; and from the scientific point of view it causes pollution to the land. Hence the throwing of paper prayer-flags is harmful both for this and the next life. This is a result of not knowing how to practice Buddhism.

On treasure vases:

These water bodies that have never witnessed any pollution are contaminated. Living things in these larger waters die whereas smaller water bodies dry up. Large lakes turn dirty as can be seen from many pictures available online. This too is a result of not knowing how to practice Buddhism.

On life ransom:

But the fish suffer 1. they suffer from being caught in the first place; 2. they suffer as they are transported long distances from east to west and consequently many die because of a lack of native water. Hence water bodies are filled with dead fish and they become polluted. This too is a result of not knowing how to practice Buddhism.

On vegetarianism:

But for the poor and subsistence of ordinary people, this choice does not exist. In the Kham region of eastern Tibet, because of the ban on eating meat, a large quantity of old and out of date food items from cities are transported and sold in villages where Tibetans live. This has become a kind of habit for people to show off by eating these Chinese foods. This is one of the main consequences of banning eating of meat. This too is a result of not knowing how to practice Buddhism.

He concludes:

Tibet may be filled with monks
But the land is filled with conflicts,
They may be praying for world peace
But their land is filled with fighting.

Mountains and valleys are filled with prayer-flags
Amidst these flags are the carcasses of dead yaks,
Businessmen may ransom many fish
But dead bodies of these fish fill the water bodies.

Nomads avoid slaughtering
But lamas commit murders,
Farmers abide by the five precepts
But monks engage in sexual acts.

There are things here in Tibet
That do not exist elsewhere,
This religious education,
A la la! What a wonder!

And every words of what he says is true. Frankly, your only complaint is that he advocates that Tibetans become educated in tshan rig, science, because when they do, they will abandon some traditional practices when they understand that they do not correspond to the principle of cause and effect. It is also well known that he thinks practices like mantra healing and so are completely fraudulent. But that is his right. Just as you have the right to credulously accept any story you hear about this lama and that lama, he has the right to doubt these things. But from his point of view, Tibetans are being ripped of and exploited by their own religious and secular authorities, and that, and nothing else, was the real cause of the Chinese Invasion of Tibet.

Tibet, prior to the fall, was a corrupt, medieval society, where aristocrats felt they could treat common people anyway they liked, where there was no democracy, and so on. It is not a surprise to discover that most of the Red Guards who engaged in the cultural revolution in Tibet were Tibetan cadres made up of illiterate Tibetan peasants, and not Chinese cadres. After the 13th Dalai passed in 1936, the Lhasa elites became too absorbed in their own power games to look up and see the train that was bearing down on them, the 14th Dalai Lama was too young to fend off the Communists, and those in Eastern Tibet were apathetic to hostile to the Lhasa Gvt.

You can claim all you like that building this statue and following that prophecy would have saved Tibet the indignity of being occupied by the Chinese Communists, but as they say, hindsight is 20/20. It is very common to blame the other guy for your own problems—— So sectarian Nyingmapas and Kagyupas blame the Gelukpas (like you are doing here), sectarian Gelukpas blame the Nyingmas and the Kagyus, etc.

The reality is that Tibet was not a unified nation, it was more like Germany or Italy in the mid 19th century. It was not unified, there was no effective national army with modern weapons and training. At the root of the issue was that the Khampas, hating Lhasa rule, did little to nothing to prevent the Chinese occupation. Similarly, the Amdowas did little to nothing to prevent the Chinese occupation. The history of the Chinese Occupation is well documented, so these facts are not disputable.

To reiterate: Tibet fell because it was not a unified country. That Lhasa nobles ignored advice from Khampa lamas is not surprising in the least. So, in reality, the real cause of the fall of Tibet was elite self-absorption combined with seething ethnic rivalry, which resulted in a situation where Tibetans, divided amongst themselves, could not stand against the Chinese occupation, a state of affairs that continues to this day.

Generally you receive the fast days vows, even the Mahayana version from someone who has them. Then can administer them in your own.

In many places in Amdo the forests were cut down before the Chinese arrived in force, for example, Amdo used to have millions of acres of forest land, which was all leveled for pasturing sheep in the 30's and 40's. The only reason the trees in Kham were not similarly raised is that the those forests are on steep mountain sides. Now there is very little old growth forest left in Amdo. Of course, the Tibetans in U and Tsang cut down all their trees more than a thousand years ago. Tibetans are human beings, with the same faults as everyone else. They are not masters of deep ecology or conservationism by any means. The Tibetans themselves hunted snow leopards, as well as Himalayan tigers, nearly to extinction.

Malcolm wrote:
We have to work with scripture and reasoning, and see what shakes out from that.

Since the fourth empowerment is given with words, it can be given online.
Since the gnosis of the wisdom consort empowerment is only symbolic now, it can be given online.
Since the secret empowerment too is a symbolic blessing of speech, which is no longer practiced according to the requirements of the ancient manuals, it too can be given online. Thus the three inner empowerments can be given online.

The eleven empowerments of the vase empowerments however, require the disciple to receive actual substances from the guru at some point during the rite. Therefore it cannot be given online. Therefore, major empowerments cannot be given or received online. Not only this, but the preparation day for a major empowerment contains many procedures needed to make the disciple a suitable recipient for each one of the four main empowerments in the rite.

Meaning empowerments (don dbang) sometimes also called symbolic empowerments (brda dbang) can be given on line. In particular, since these generally include the empowerment of the potential of vidyā (rig pa'i rtsal dbang), they are satisfactory as ripening empowerments. Also, the empowerment of the potential of vidyā alone, sometimes calls "direct introduction" is satisfactory as a ripening empowerment. This is because the empowerment of the potential of vidyā is the mother of all other empowerments.

Permissions (rje gnang) can be given online. Blessings (byin brlabs) cannot, since they also require substances.

The idea that one can receive empowerments and lungs from recordings is not reasonable, just as it is not reasonable to claim one can receive monastic ordination from a recording. Someone who claims to have received such empowerments and lungs via recordings should understand that other people will not accept this.

There are only four or five elements that make the human body. One of those is air. If you wish to confirm this read the Nandagarbhavikranti sūtra, which describes how the air element shapes the fetus over its thirty-eight week gestational period. Or, you can read the Vajra Rosary Tantra, which is now in English translation, and is one of the primary sources for the doctrine of the ten vāyus and how they function in the human body. Or you can read the Profound Inner Meaning by the Third Karmapa, which unifies the teachings of the vajra body in one place, translated by Elizabeth Callahan.

Translating the word vāyu/rlung as "energy" is fashionable, but it is also completely inaccurate.

This is going a bit beyond my point, however. My point is that photons are not a good comparison with Meru. Compare the nature of one mountain to another rather than an inscrutable and incomprehensible corpuscle.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course they are: photons conventionally exist, Meru does not. Both lack mass and charge, but the former explains the function of physical light, the latter explains nothing at all anymore. But we still use this axial cosmology symbolically. I was recently reminded (in the new bio of Dogen by Steve Heine) of John McRae's four dictums of Zen studies, the first of which is "it's not true, therefore, it is more important." I think this can be applied to Buddhist mythopoeia across the board.

I don't agree. People are conditioned in our culture to accept cartesian dualism from the cradle. The reason why people turn away from theistic religion in general is that it does not correspond to their experience. They have never experienced consciousness in any way other than through their physical senses. Those who have a notion of an immaterial self or consciousness have it because they have been conditioned to think the mind (soul) and body are different by 500 years of Cartesianism. They don' have to be philosophical to be influenced by ideas that have been dominant themes in our culture for hundreds of years.

Buddhist substance dualism is predicated on different principles that cartesian dualism. But we can see it still provokes problems for Westerners by their difficulty in distinguishing the Buddhist principal of karmic transmigration from the Neoplatonic/Christian concept of the soul (psyche).

There there is Nāgārjunas Ratnavali, Mahāyanavimsika, the four praises, and so on, which give more detail on the bodhisattva path from a Mahayāna perspective. While it is certainly true the Yogacāra school greatly elaborated on the details, its all there in Madhyamaka.

Well, if Tibetans could or would set up casinos...that's exactly what it looks like. The Chinese have used our treatment of native people as a pretext for ignoring US complaints about their human rights abuses.

A way of life that existed even twenty years ago has all but vanished everywhere but the most remote parts of the Tibetan plateau.

So, Tibetan modernization means advocating for Tibetan language and religious rights combined with assimilation into broader Han culture. They have no choice. Tibetan independence is an impractical dream and everyone but some holdouts in Dharamshala know this. Nevertheless, Tibetans are a stubborn bunch and many refuse to assimilate, refusing to learn Chinese beyond a kind of pidgin, despite the obvious economic and social advantages.  While I sympathize with the anti-assimilationists, theirs is, in the long run, a losing cause. They need to shift from resistance to advocacy.

Malcolm wrote:
He is making a different point, he is claiming these practices do not yield the promised benefits (and in the case of prayer flags, do not even have a Buddhist origin), that the pursuit of them robs poor Tibetans of money better spent elsewhere, and so on, that practices like life ransom (srog bslu), in the manner in which it is pursued in Tibet, is harmful to the rivers and streams of Tibet through the introduction of invasive species from China, and that the push towards vegetarianism is a result of the undue influence of Chinese Buddhism, which comes at the expense of the health of Tibetan people, who have traditionally enjoyed a diet high in dairy and meat.


Frankly, I don't approve of the practice of life release. It is generally practiced without thought of the consequences for the local environment:

In Asian Buddhist societies, life release has led to significant ecological harm when invasive species, parasites and disease are introduced to wild populations of animals. It has led to the introduction of American bullfrogs in China and tilapia and red-eared sliders, a species of turtle, in Taiwan, according to the Society for Conservation Biology.

The practice has also caused problems outside of Asia. In 2017, two Buddhists from London were fined a total of £28,000 (about $36,000) after pleading guilty to illegally releasing more than 700 non-native crabs and lobsters into the Atlantic Ocean off the English coast, according to the Guardian.

If people who did these things did so in a thoughtful manner, I be less opposed, but most people do it out of idiot compassion, not understanding the wider impacts of their desire to accumulate merit.

The idea that by even looking at written dzogchen texts before we have received "pointing out" (and I think the OP pointed out how flimsy that sometimes is as a "qualification") we will cut ourselves off from ever being able to practice meditation or dzogchen is, imho, an idea for the spiritually immature.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct, immature (ma smin pa) people who have not been matured (smin pa) though empowerment and received the liberating instructions shouldn't read Vajrayāna texts at all, let alone Dzogchen texts. What my teachers have stressed about Dzogchen teachings, especially Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, is that one is at risk of blocking one's path by reading material for which one does not have the transmission. Longchenpa is quite explicit about the need for secrecy in Dzogchen teachings. If one doesn't want to follow his advice, then whose advice should one follow? This does not mean that Dzogchen is secret like a top secret document. It means that it should only be approached in the proper way to ensure the integrity of the lineage. Included in that proper way are not reading texts for which one does not have the appropriate level of transmission. It's a rule I have followed all of my life.

There is only one way to get deeper, and you have been advised upon how to do that.



sokol said:
By the way curious fact and maybe something worth considering: the only way I got to know part of the content of the Six Lamps, Twenty-One Nails and some other parts of Zhang Zhung NyenGyud for instance, that as someone here informed me are forbidden "to even look at" without transmission ( additionally suggesting that I am a "fool" and a "thief" having done so) is through quotations in a book by Geshe Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche, that has been prefaced and recommended to anyone by other high Dzogczen authorities and HH Dalai Lama himself – and there hasn't been a single mention about a need for formal authorisation to read it throughout the book.

Malcolm wrote:
The whole of Zhang Zhung snyan rgyud is samaya restricted, as are all texts and commentaries on Dzogchen. Sure, there are a few popular books out there that discuss Dzogchen view, and so on, but these contain virtually nothing of the actual instructions of Dzogchen practice. The books that are out there, like Achard's Six Lamps, and so on, are all published in order to provide practitioners with access to primary source material. Even then, they are not very useful without someone to explain them.

sokol said:
Not a warm welcome to say the least.

Malcolm wrote:
The welcome you received was in response to the tone of your greeting. Some of us have been practicing these teachings for three decades and moreover, read Tibetan and have clocked many hours sitting at the feet of such masters as Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, and so on. Making statements like "I am intimately familiar with rigpa (in my own spontaneus way)" is laughable from someone who has never sat and received Dzogchen teachings.

As for calling you a fool and thief, I didn't call you either thing. I said, "Reading Dzogchen texts, and other tantric texts without transmission is indeed worthless, improper, and condemned in those very texts themselves. Only fools ignore this" and "Do not read Dzogchen books prior to having received transmission and instruction. Otherwise, you are being a thief of the teachings. This is very negative."

As for the first statement, this is because no one these days can understand Dzogchen teachings immediately, even with proper transmission. Not even Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche understood the meaning of Dzogchen immediately.  Before he met his root guru, he had thirteen Dzogchen teachers and had received the whole tradition of Buddhist Dzogchen teachings. It was only when he sat with Rigzin Changchub Dorje that he understand the real meaning of Dzogchen teachings. As for the second statement, Dzogchen teachings are guarded by very powerful guardians. While some claim the Bonpos assert their guardians have loosened restrictions on Dzogchen teachings, this is not the case with Buddhist Dzogchen teachings. There are no lineage masters of Buddhist Dzogchen teachings who can loosen such restrictions, because the last lineage holder of Dzogchen teachings was Longchen Rabjam, and there won't be another one for thousands of years. Thus, since the guardians are the owners of the teachings, one who transgresses the seal of secrecy placed on Dzogchen teachings risks their wrath.

While it is often said that Dzogchen is the teaching for this age, for many reasons, this does not mean that people can just do what they like with them. The integrity of Dzogchen teachings is maintained through respecting the methods of transmission and promulgation of Dzogchen teachings described in the Dzogchen tantras themselves and the commentaries on them by ancient masters such as Vimalamitra, and so on. You haven't even begun to learn about such things because you have no teacher.

You are confused because some teachers like my guru, Tenzin Wangyal, HH Dalai Lama, and so on, have published some books that are "open," meaning that they describe a little bit about the Dzogchen teaching. But actually, they really do not say very much at all. They offer only a glimpse for the curious, nothing more.

So if you are actually interested in becoming a practitioner of Dzogchen, rather than just adding to the collection of spiritual teachings you have gathered, develop some humility, go find a qualified teacher of Dzogchen, and listen more than you talk.

Of course, if they are not your teacher, you can criticize them for these issues as much as you like, with the caveat that you may be criticizing a bodhisattva.

This does not apply, however, in case where the teacher has themselves utterly broken their samaya with their students, where they have actually harmed the lives and health of their students, which is quite another thing.

Yes, but without a teacher there is no Dzogchen to speak of. One cannot introduce themselves to Dzogchen. It is impossible. The Dzogchen tantras themselves assert that this is the case. A book cannot introduce one to Dzogchen, etc. Claiming otherwise is irresponsible, basically, one is breaking samaya to make a claim that one can study and practice Dzogchen without a guru, on one's own, from a book. Worse, one is encouraging others to travel down a false path.

Yes. That is the correct way. Find a teacher to study under. Do not read Dzogchen books prior to having received transmission and instruction. Otherwise, you are being a thief of the teachings. This is very negative.

Malcolm wrote:
That’s largely because it is caste restricted. Newars who are serious about practicing Vajrayana seek out Tibetan gurus, because the Vajracaryas don’t teach outside their clique.

Zhen Li said:
In cases where this happens, they usually maintain a Vajrācārya as the family priest and seek teachings from the lama for personal practice. Of course, there are also non-Vajrācāryas Newars who have become lamas, some of whom in turn serve in that capacity for other non-Vajrācāryas. Some non-Newars (and a few Newars too) follow a member of the Rana family who became a rinpoche. The main thing is, lamas cannot really do Newar lifecycle rites, so even those who are really into Tibetan Buddhism need to have a Vajrācārya family priest. Anyway, things are changing gradually, as I mentioned, and it is conceivable that eventually people without Vajrācārya parents could be given acāryābhiṣekha, but yes, if someone is interested in practising Newar Buddhism, at least for now, it's going to exclude esoteric practices and essentially be exoteric Mahāyāna with a few exoteric vajrayāna elements thrown in. Frankly, I think a lot of Śākyas prefer it the way it is because they don't have to learn all the procedures personally, they can just sponsor a guru to do it and due to the saṃkalpa they still get all the benefits.

Malcolm wrote:
So, you’ve basically ceded my point. Tibet is the place that preserved and the depth and breadth of the Indian Vajrayana tradition. People who are interested in practicing Vajrayana will naturally seek out Tibetan teachers or teachers in this tradition. No other tradition is as complete.

It's a correction without an error to correct.

But my point really is that Yogacāra offers much more of a narratology than Madhyamaka. It's loaded with many more concepts, fine distinctions, and path narratives than Mādhyamikas typically offer.

There just isn't much juice for the POMO scene to squeeze out of Madhyamaka. Madhyamaka is more akin to ordinary language philosophy than anything else in the Western scene.

It wasn't an argument more than an observation. And if it were silly, that WaPo article never would have been written. One story that can be told is that the post-structuralist attitude, filtered via countless ways through higher learning, may have shifted the intellectual (and eventually the popular) culture in such a way that people are more open to Trumpian (and Putinian) forms of discourse.

Malcolm wrote:
And this relates directly to why Madhyamaka isn't a challenge to conventional knowledge, unlike deconstruction and other post-modernist trends, for which it is consistently mistaken.

Madhyamaka, if anything, does not seek to dismantle conventional knowledge, so much as site it appropriately in the context of liberation. It makes strong arguments against incoherent, essentialist claims which undermine conventional knowledge, in order to show that knowledge requires functionality in order to be considered knowledge at all. Its appeal to the illusory nature of phenomena and knowledge is not an argument for pure subjectivity, as it is often mistaken for. Instead, its appeal to the illusory nature of phenomena and knowledge is an argument for consensus and convention, while at the same time, negating the irrationality of imputing essences to dependently originated things.

I would argue that the present interest in Yogacāra, for example, is as much a function of the penetration of postmodernism into Buddhist studies as it is a function of increased linguistic understanding of Buddhist texts and so on. It is not an accident that in America and England, the continental fascination with yogacāra has met with quite a bit of resistance.

Now that we have scholars moving from being disinterested coroners of religion to invested proponents, this is changing, and it is not surprising that the strongest proponents of gzhan stong and yogacāra are Europeans. Frankly, a lot of argument between modern Mādhyamikas such as myself and those who adhere to various species of yogācara can be traced to a divide between how knowledge is handled by analytical and continental philosophy in general.

On the other hand, I can't tell you how many dissertations I have read in Buddhist studies over the years complete with accounts of methodologies derived from Said, Tambiah, etc. and so on. It seems that modern professors in Buddhist studies departments are demanding 100 pages or so filled with bullshit about the student's methodology and approach rooted in some postmodern drivel.

It is also not surprising that we have modern lamas who seem to have grasped onto Nietzschean moral nihilism with respect to the behavior of "mahāsiddhas," especially of the modern variety, whose main siddhis seem to be gathering students and bilking them of their money, just to bring this whole exchange

I suspect none of us uni people has really been able to believe it since the 1960s. Burroughs quipped that the Vietnam War provoked the longest and most sustained grassroot protests in the 20th century, supported by the vast majority of public intellectuals -- and, he says, all of it amounted to a fart.

Malcolm wrote:
Burroughs was wrong. It led to the US Military exiling the press. When I was a child, every night between 1968-1975 there was unedited, raw news footage of the Vietnam war on ABC, CBS, and NBC. Now, we see at best sanitized footage with grim journalists standing in other countries reporting on the  latest war news. So, the effect of the anti-war movement was to cause the US military to end press access to war zones. This is one reason we stayed in Iraq and Afghanistan for so long. As for the latter, many people in the US had no idea we were still there when Biden finally pulled us out.

However, Nietzsche’s skepticism of states leads directly to skepticism of democratic institutions. A bias or an operating principle in analytical philosophy is the defense of liberalism. Attempts to rehabilitate N’s thought as conducive to democratic liberalism are failures, in my estimation.

The common interpretation of this is more than a little unfair to Nietzsche.  Hitler never read him, his main philosophical motivation was Heidegger.  Neitzsche's actual ideas were consistently misrepresented from the Nazi era to today - GötzenDämmerung contains extensive anti-statist thoughts, and the "what does not kill you" line is almost always taken out of context to mean exactly the opposite of what he was actually saying.

Malcolm wrote:
Nietzsche was a cipher, meaning that one could selectively read whatever one wanted into him. Unfortunately, Will to Power is the most read title of one of his least understood books, inspiring many mini-Hitler wannabes. The other thing is that N has always ironically been more inspiring to the right than the left, because they interpret his anti statism not as a critique of state power, but as critique of consensus and cooperation.

He was very clear about what he was doing and one could either "be in his boat" or not. His list of 27 personal samayas he adopted before he began teaching Dzogchen is illustrative of his whole approach to being a teacher. He did not give a flying f**k about Tibetan hierarchy per se, while at the same time caring deeply about Tibetan culture and history. But he never tried to turn his students into little imitation Tibetans nor did he try to invent a dharma culture by creating a mashup of Asian and Western cultures, like Trungpa, etc. He understood westerners were westerners, and that what we needed was the essentials of Dharma, not all the cultural bullshit that has hitched a ride with Vajrayāna teachings. He always put Dzogchen Community first, even when it caused problems in his personal life. He always used to called himself Dzogchen Community member #1, as we all have membership numbers.

There is no little to no civil studies taught in primary or secondary schools any more. There is little to no PE taught in Inner City schools because of lack of funding. Classrooms sizes range from 40 to 60 students at all levels in public schools systems. Teachers are not given living wages. Teachers Unions are demonized on the smallest pretexts. It goes way beyond curriculums.

The US educational system has been rendered dysfunctional by a whole host of issues beyond teaching reading, writing, and arithmetic, and as far as the latter three are concerned, I would say that most students in the US in the public school system graduate with insufficient skills in grammar and composition. Every college in the US has writing and grammar class requirements for freshman, because the functional literacy rate in the US has been plummeting for the past five decades.  For example:

According to the U.S. Department of Education, 54% of U.S. adults 16-74 years old - about 130 million people - lack proficiency in literacy, reading below the equivalent of a sixth-grade level.

Malcolm wrote:
The general bardo (antarabhāva, literally the "in-between existence") is not another realm. It describes the state a sentient being goes through for 7 weeks until it takes birth in one of the six realms—hell being, ghost, animal, human, titan, or god—which in turn are part of the three realms, the desire realm, form realm, and formless realm.

TannersHatch said:
Isn't this 'wheel' largely a Hindu concept?

Malcolm wrote:
No, actually, not at all. The hindu concept of rebirth is not recognizable in Buddhism at all.

The bardo that "Liberation from Hearing in the Bardo" describes is unique the Dzogchen system. It is called the bardo of dharmatā. It is not described in any other tantric system outside of the Dzogchen system. The Dzogchen system describes four or six bardos. The other tantric traditions in Buddhism only describe one.

TannersHatch said:
I should exclusively learn from learned folks such as yourself do you advise?

Malcolm wrote:
If you wish to learn about the teachings which come from Dzogchen, then you should rely on teachers who are expert in that system. If you want to learn about ayahuasca, then you should learn from teachers expert in that system. If you want to learn about Hinduism, you learn from teachers expert in that system. But what you must not do is confuse and conflate these systems in a naive, its-all-one-man ecumenicism.

TannersHatch said:
Guess the Bardos are closed to me until I get the lung eh? Where will I go do you think?

Malcolm wrote:
Everyone goes through all the bardos. Without instruction, however, you won't even recognize the bardo of this life, never mind the bardo of death or the bardo of dharmatā. You will die, not recognizing the bardo of death or the bardo of dharmatā, passing straight into the bardo of rebirth, where you will take birth again in the six realms after seven weeks. A day in the bardo equals the amount of time one is able to remain in samadhi. So for most beings, those 49 "days" pass in 49 moments, less than a minute after the consciousness separates from the body, according to the Dzogchen teachings of which "Liberation through Hearing in the Bardo" is a part.

There is some truth to this, but not all. As I mentioned before, the defenestration of the US educational system has a been a GOP policy since bussing. White people literally moved away from school districts where their kids are educated alongside Black kids, taking their tax dollars with them. A large driving force behind the "white flight" to the suburbs in many urban areas was because of education. Black majority schools have outdated textbooks, no computers, you name it, they don't have it. School policy and curriculum should set at the national level, not the local or state level. Want to educated your kids apart from that, fine, send your kids to private school, but no funding from the state, period, no grants, etc., nothing. Schools should focus on liberal arts as well as STEM. What we turn out now is a bunch of uneducated dummies who do well enough in STEM programs but understand nothing about history, literature, how governments work, and so on.

But that was not my point. The three natures certainly are an attempt to describe the two truths, but there is no three truths in Yogacāra. The imputed nature is not a truth, though the imagination of the unreal (the dependent nature) is relative truth for Yogacāra, and the absence of the imputed nature in the dependent nature is what Yogacāra asserts to be ultimate truth (the perfected nature).

Of course. But that is irrelevant.

Now if your position is that the two truths are not found in either seven-text Abdhidharma collections, and only appears in commentaries substantially dated after Nāgārjuna, then you have to accept, by your own reasoning, that the "two truths" as a term occurs only in Mahāyāna, and that its presence in śrāvaka sources after Nāgārjuna are polemical response against emptiness as ultimate truth.
The Mahavibhasa precedes Nagarjuna.

Malcolm wrote:
Again, this is uncertain. Walser claims that Ratnavali was written between 175-225. But it could easily have been written 50 years earlier. The Mahāvibhasa was supposedly compiled during the Reign of Kanishka (127-151 CE) in Bactria. This is 24 year period is a pretty narrow window to compose such a monumental text and then distribute it across India to Andhra Pradesh, to be received and studied by Nāgārjuna.

Beyond that, it would take some further research to identify early occurrences of the two truths doctrine.

That being the case, you should not make confident proclamations about it.

And there is the possibility, quite distinct and equally remote, that a text like the Pitāputrasamāgamana was "converted" into a Mahāyāna text.
The idea that there are just two truths is not that fixed, as the Pudgalavadins had a threefold division (Pudgalavada Buddhism, p 105),

No. This is an error. The three natures are not three truths, but that is beyond our discussion here.

and the Mahavibhasa notes the existence of twofold, threefold, and fivefold divisions according to different interpreters (Sarvastivada Abhidharma, p 77-78). So, if the two truths doctrine were such a clear case in the sutras, there would be no reason for differences.

Why would anyone disagree when the doctrine of two truths is accepted by practically everyone? But it doesn't mean it's accepted because of what's in the sutras. Nagarjuna argues against ideas that are rather Abhidharma based, like the whole dharma-theory.

Malcolm wrote:

If the two truths had no basis in the agamic sūtras, for what reason then did the Sautrantikas accept it without question?

After all, the term "two truths" does not occur in the PP in 8000 lines either, assuming this is one of the earliest and it was before Nāgārjuna. But it discusses dharmas as being mere conventions and names. It also mentioned pāramārtha five times only.

Kāsyapaparivarta only mentions don dam pa, pārmārtha, twice, pāramārthasatya once. If there is an ultimate truth, there must be something which is not ultimate.

Are you suggesting that the idea of two truths in Mahāyāna also comes from Abhidharma commentaries, which we have no evidence of? Its unclear which sūtras Nāgārjuna has before him, other than a PP sūtra and probably the Kāsyapaparivarta, but given that he and Lokaṣema were contemporaries, it is reasonable to assume at least he had these sūtras in front him. Sūtrasammucaya, attributed to Nāgārjuna, has only three references to ultimate truth and a relative truth, in a text called the Candragarbha Chapter (zla ba snyin po le'u), another called the Candraprabha Chapter (zla ba 'od kyi le'u) and a third text, Meeting of the Father and Son Sutra (Pitāputrasamāgamana), where the term "two truths" is explicitly introduced.

What Astus is looking for is the term "satyavidhaṃdvaya" in a sūtra in the same way we find "catursatya" in order to confirm the Buddha taught two truths. What I am pointing out is that term needn't be there for the intention to be there. And the intention is clearly there.

Yes it is a way to manifest compassion. However when done mindlessly it is also a good way to develop delusion even further. It is not unusual to increase their disturbing emotions based on trying to change things which are far beyond their control so they miss the time and waste their effort which could be used for practice of the mind. In an age like this including in the West, most people's deepest disturbing emotions tend to lie within their beliefs in politics and some of whom are into engaged Buddhism who try to promote and push their own political narrative on others in the disguise of engaged Buddhism. This is not compassion. Instead, it is manipulative behaviour based on delusion. For others who are of the more sincere type, its the attitude of trying to cover the entire surface of the earth with rubber instead of wearing rubber shoes.

I don't agree with this. The Buddha is very clear in a passage that appears in Śamathadeva's commentary [mngon, ju 47a (Toh. 4094)] that one is not to have attachment to the etymologies (nirukti) of the people (jānapada), one is not to hasten to mundane names. It is because they are false.

Prior to this, [mngon, ju 40b (Toh. 4094)], the Buddha is quoted as "Bhikṣus, the supreme (mchog) falsity is the phenomena that are false and deceptive. Bhikṣus, the supreme truths are like this, this is how they are. Therefore, the bhikṣus who posses that possess, the supreme blessings of truth." Moreover, there is a whole section later, where he discusses that which is empty as being false, deceptive, etc.

So you really just have not looked well enough, because of a literal mindedness you have been infected with through reading too much text critical literature. To insist that the two truths are not in the agamas because the term "satyadvaya" does not explicitly occur is very myopic. But the two truths are there, you just have to know to see them.

Instead, it outlined the ultimate, and the conventional is what is imputed over that ultimate, the fourfold ultimate in the case of the Theravāda sect. Now, the fourfold paramattha is not from the Theravādin Adhidhamma itself. It is a systematization of their dhamma-matrices as presented in texts like Dhammasaṅgaṇī.

We were not allowed either, but we went anyway, much to the terror of the caretaker when we arrived unannounced. We got a fifteen minute tour because our teacher's 75 year old mother was along for the ride, as well as the senior teachers at the Tibetan Medical College.

Now
in fact doesn't change much as a beginner, in the center, you'll probably have a Bouddha statue,  Tsongkhapa instead of a Karmapa or of Jigten Sumgön or Guru Rinpoché ... daily recitations will be different, basic teachings also - there will be probably a form of lojong (mind training), Kagyü an Gelug tradition come anyway from the same source, Potowa -, and from there Atisha, Serlingpa

Nicholas2727 said:
How would the basic teachings differ between Gelug and Kagyu? Im assuming Gelug would teach more from the Lam Rim and Kagyu from Jewel Ornament of Liberation? Or are you referring to this in a different way?

nyonchung said:
Right, not only Lamrim, but Atisha's "Lamp of Wisdom", but I was thinking to the pratice of tonglen (taking and giving) and its root verses in the Lojong (Basic verses of Mind Training) by Potowa, add Langrithangpa's eight verses, all this part of basic teachings in both schools - add the 37 verses of Ngülchu Thogmé Zangpo (nominally a drugpa-kagyüpa)
There is also Atisha's teachings on the "three classes" of being - Kalu Ripoché's centers were supposed to use Taranatha's commentary (Kyebu Sumgyi Lamrim)

There is an immense Gelug collection commentaries on Kadampa teachings accumulated through centuries, including contemporary ones

I love how invested you are in capitalist hierarchy. Like debt and money were real things, not created by an elite to maintain control. The strong ruling over the weak is the natural order. It should be celebrated. You net worth is your score in capitalism. So which one are you?

Malcolm wrote:
Your central thesis, that debt and money created by elites to maintain control is an unsupportable assertion. That debt and money can be used that way, however, is certainly true. You might read David Graeber's Debt, the First 5000 Years.

As for myself, I just deal with the practical reality of putting food in my mouth, without getting tangled up in ideologies about economics, certainly Marxism is an abject failure. Capitalism is not going away any time soon. So better get used to it and try and make sure it at least is contained by democratic ideals.

My way of thinking is more result-oriented.  I am more interested in policy than theory.

"The difference between Geluk and Kagyu is guru loyalty."

Also, what exactly are you saying here?

Malcolm wrote:
Some sectarian, triumphalist bullshit, I imagine. But it is pervasive throughout Tibetan Buddhist world, so it is not surprising. Everyone feels their guru is the best, their blessings are the best, their lineage is the best, their practice is the best, their opinion is the best. That's the nature of egotism.

Crazywisdom said:
Let's not pretend we're ecumenical Malcolm. We all know the Geluk view as applied in Vajrayana is considered wrong view in Kagyu and Nyingma.

Malcolm wrote:
No, we do not know this. It's a ridiculous assertion. If it were true, then one would be accusing Jigme Lingpa, Shabkar, Dodrupchen Tenpé Nyima, and so on, of having wrong views, because all these men trained in the Geluk system and promulgated Geluk Yikcha in their monasteries, which remain the curriculum current in most Nyingma monasteries in Golok and Amdo. Moreover, it amounts to a claim that Geluk Vajrayāna is invalid and is incapable of producing awakening. This is a ridiculous assertion and merely shows narrow mindedness and lack of education on the part of those who sponsor such views, no matter who they are are. This is illustrated by the shame expressed by Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok, for example, for having naively criticized the views of Tsongkhapa when he was young, whom he later to came to understand was a great mahasiddha, etc. Just study Tsonghapa's praise to dependent origination. You will be unable to find in it a single fault.

I strongly disagree with his advocacy of charter schools. I think they are 1) undermining public school education, 2) creating a two tier system that actually privileges white communities and sucks resources away from communities of color, and 3) is a back door for the public funding of religious education.

No, theory did not play any role. People saw their inequality and did something about it, leaving privileged journalists like Marx to write theories about their daily experience, while he pursued his bourgeoise lifestyle, disconnected from their lives.
