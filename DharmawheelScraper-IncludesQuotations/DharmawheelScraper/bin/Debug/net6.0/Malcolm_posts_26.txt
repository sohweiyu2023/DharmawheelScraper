Well, highest yoga tantra has thirteen stages. Some schools interpret these merely adding two more stages to the bodhisattva path, other schools understand this as being actual stages of buddhahood. The locus classicus of the thirteen stages is the Samputa Tantra, which pretty explicitly states that buddhas of the eleventh and twelfth bhumi have slightly defective omniscience. In yoga tantra on down, buddhahood is the eleventh stage.

That is not a refutation, that is not even a consequence.

You cannot rely on a vague legal principle like "penumbra" to explain this away, that somehow this third truth was lurking there all along, just waiting to be discovered by Zhiyi, mystically concealed in the Lotus Sutra by the Buddha.

I have already provided scriptural citations flat out denying there is such a thing as third truth, etc., as well as citations which show how this verse intended to be understood. As far as I am concerned, the whole discussion is based on Chinese Buddhist misunderstandings of the intent of Nāgārjuna, misunderstandings that continue to this day because people refuse to study these things properly.

The Truth of Non-substantiality (Kutai)
The Truth of Temporary Existence (Ketai)
The Truth of the Middle Way (Chutai)
It is quite equivalent to Yogacara Theory. It is said that Yogacara had tried to harmonize the views of asti and nasti vadin. I do not know whether Zhiyi had studied Mahayanasutralamkara or not as there might be Paramartha’s translation at his time (i.e. probably). However, his description is equivalent to this verse: (34) When one has realized the vacuity of inexistence, and also vacuity of such and such existence, and has known the natural vacuity, one can say that one is the knower of the void.

Asanga, tr Surekha Vijaya Limaye, (2000), Mahayanasutralamkara, Sri Satguru Publications, Chapter XIV, p 272
Anyway, those, who are more familiar with Zhiyi, can cross check it.


Malcolm wrote:
Zhiyi would not have read the Sūtralāṃkāra, it was not translated into Chinese until 630.

And this is just a reference to to the three natures, the imputed, the dependent, and the perfected. What are these? The verse is, "Since the emptiness of the nonexistence is know, and likewise, since the emptiness of the existent and natural emptiness is known, one is called the knower of emptiness."  The first is the imagined, the second is the dependent (aka all-basis consciousness), and the third of the perfected (the absence of the imputed in the dependent).

Now. in Vasubandhu's commentary on Maitreya's verse (this text was not written by Asanga), he comments that the first emptiness is the imputed nature; the second is the dependent nature, and the third is the perfected nature. But again, this is a question of perception, and it is clarified more readily by the Madhyānatavibhańgakāriks̄:

The imagination of the unreal exists;
duality does not exist in it;
emptiness exists in this;
and the former exists in the latter.

Since everything is explained 
as not empty and not not-empty, 
since there is existence, since there is nonexistence, and since there is existence,
that is the middle way.

The first line of the first verse explicitly explains the appearances of the triple realm, that is, the imagination of the unreal (parikalpita), that is, the imagination of subject and object exists. However, that duality does not exist, and in fact, it is exists as the imagination of an unreal subject and object. The former, duality, exists in the latter, emptiness, which is to say duality exists in a consciousness that is empty of duality.

Now, here emptiness and the imagination of the unreal both exist (not empty), but they are empty of duality (not not-empty). The imagination of the unreal is all compounded phenomena, and emptiness is uncompounded, hence, this explains all phenomena. Therefore, the imagination of the unreal exists, duality does not exist, but that emptiness of that duality does exist; and since everything is not wholly empty and everything is also not wholly non-empty, that is the middle way as described by Maitreyanatha.

To say that not everything is wholly empty is to say that everything exists as a projection of a deluded consciousness; to say that everything is not wholly nonempty is to say that the projections of that deluded consciousness do not exist. This is Maitreyanatha'ss formula of the middle way.

This presentation is completely different than what Zhiyi is getting at. Zhiyi is trying to reconcile a substantialist misunderstanding of Madhyamaka that plagued earlier Chinese scholars, who mistook epistemology of the two truths for an ontology. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, Zhiyi never totally overcame this ontology, and still continued this misunderstanding, even as he tried to resolve it.

Malcolm wrote:
Do you know what an excluded middle is? For example, when confront with a choice: true or false, there is no third choice. The middle is excluded because, for example, between a false cognition and a true cognition, there is no third option, a true cognition that is false, or a false cognition that is true.

Quite frankly, Zhiyi's argument fails the excluded middle test, rendering his position irrational. Nāgārjuna himself never violates the law of the excluded middle.

When we understand that the two truths refer to cognitions of objects, rather than objects themselves, then we can understand very clearly that the two truths are describing the experiential mode of perception of worldly beings on the one hand, and the experiential mode of perception of āryas in equipoise on the other.

Worldly beings can conceptually infer ultimate truth (otherwise, they could never realize it); but even that inference is not their experiential mode of perception, since an inference too is just a relative truth, even in mundane equipoise.

No third step is needed. Why? Because there is no excluded middle in the two truths. It is not like the two truths leaves something out that needs to further supplied. As I mentioned before, the two truths are objects of cognitions, true and false respectively. In order to have a third third truth, one would have to have an object of a cognition that was at the same time true and false. And that is impossible.

One thing to keep in mind is the absolute becomes provisional over the term and the lotus sutra reveals this and allows for synchronization.

This happens on a sublime level genetically and expresses itself in our nature as well.

This can make an absolute teaching provisional over time, but contextually that teaching is still absolute and provisional from the perspective of the lotus sutra. In reality is both and neither, etc and so forth.

Why?

Because all of this occurs in the living moment, not outside of it so it the ultimate basis of perspective needs to be reconciled to the living moment from the point of cause which is the world honored one's enlightenment.

This is why verbiage such as eagle's peak or vulture's peak is used. It is denoting a hierarchy of conscious perspective whi.ch becomes natural over the term.

If we don't attempt to hold this all in the living moment we aren't fathoming the honored one's complete and perfect enlightenment because it included us and others if we can only muster the faith in such a prospect.

We aren't even discussing whether or not it's publicly funded healthcare or some sort or a private hospital. If it's private, it's an even poorer example.

I grew up in New Mexico (with undocumented friends btw) and spent time in emergency rooms, private and county. Did lots of dumb stuff when I was young. I can say from personal experience that if they were at a private hospital they are going through the same stuff I was without insurance, and in a couple cases  people I knew would straight pay cash for their healthcare...I just went into debt for mine.

So to make arguments about them "stealing our healthcare" you'd first need to establish you are talking about state exchanges or something. In my current profession (Drug and Alcohol counseling) the undocumented I've met again just pay cash for the most part and have no coverage anyway. AFAIK the ACA has language that actually excludes illegal/undocumented immigrants, and that is the conceivable place where they'd be "stealing" our healthcare. There is very little funding for immigrants public healthcare, a few cities I think.

Obama realized this, and worked harder against it than any previous president, which both sides of the Punch-and-Judy drama seem to have forgotten. This could well be a defining issue in the election, so Dems had better get smart if they don't want four more years of Trump.

The fact is that not one single job in the US was “stolen” by an undocumented worker, and the idiocy of denying health care to all undocumented people is simply unfathomable. Catering to white demographic anxiety creates more problems than it solves because that anxiety is baseless, and leads to out and out racism and nationalism. Of course Hispanics (those from Hispaniola) oppose illegal immigration, since they are mostly Cubans who have been given preferential treatment for decades, darlings of the GOP’s stupid bias against Castro. “Latinos” on the other hand—mostly native people and mestizo people who actually speak Spanish as a second language—flooded the US as a result of the collapse of 50k small farms in the immediate aftermath of NAFTA, when corn prices plummeted in Mexico, etc., because of the US dumping cheap corn on the Mexican market. This in turn caused a large scale population transfer into Mexican cities, which led to high unemployment in Mexico, and caused many of those same, now landless, campesinos to cross the border in search of work in the US. For 20 years Mexican villages were empty of anyone but old people and children who relied on moneyed wired from the US.

So, we caused this problem because we subscribed to free-market neoliberalism.

To fix it, we need to restore the idea that markets are not just engines for corporations to take profits for their shareholders, but need to be tightly regulated in order to prevent unintended consequences of the kind that NAFTA caused, or the kind we are experiencing now because of the global market panic over covid-19. BTW, the recession caused by global reactions to covid-19 all but ensures that Trump is a one term president. Presidents do not get re-elected in the midst of recessions. This one is going to be quite severe, worldwide.

The evolution of teachings accords with the capacity, causes and conditions of the people over the course of time. The past influences the future but does not supercede it. Everything flowing in accord to how it occurred. Cause and effect is an essential theme, not just internal but from beginning to end.

Keeping this context is what nichiren does in his teachings. This is what he did with all other teachings. In this regard the lotus is the spine of the book to all other teachings since the evaluations are made against it.

There was a reason for the assembly in the lotus sutra. This is why it is not a subjective matter for lotus practioners. This is why other distilations are not subjective either. The teaching contains ten realms. It was developed from prior teachings that taught less. Same as the truths.

Why cant they both remain golden without contest? Nichiren only looked at how they suited sentient beings as a metric for comparison.

So when an object (or perception) of mind or matter is recognized as being a result of, or manifestation of dependent origination, we are better able to discern wise and compassionate response within that recognized relative experience?

I just report what the Buddha said, and what Indian masters say. When I examine developments in Buddhist philosophy outside of India, I judge them according to two criteria: One, do they comport with what the Buddha and Indian masters say? Two, what are the cultural factors that led to the development of this or that school. I apply this to Tibetan Buddhism as well. There are many intellectual trends in Tibetan Buddhism which are novel departures from Indian Buddhist norms.

Since I do not subscribe the Mappo anxiety which dominated Japanese Buddhist discourse during the Kamakura period, the arguments of Pure Land Buddhists, Nichiren Buddhists, and Soto Zen Buddhists do not move me very much; just as the degenerate age anxiety which dominated Indian Vajrayāna from the Pala period onward and Tibetan Buddhist discourse won't move you very much. I don't expect it too. For this reason, for example, Tibetan Buddhists do not pay much attention to the Lotus Sūtra. The Lotus Sūtra is in our canon of course, and a very good translation of it from Sanskrit and Tibetan may be found at the 84000.com. But we don't read it (other than in yearly sūtra recitation rituals) or study it much, and we certainly do not think Nichiren's arguments about it being the summum bonum of the Buddha's teachings are valid at all, because his arguments are based on hermeneutical criteria that are utterly foreign to Indo-Tibetan Buddhism. That said, all Tibetan Buddhist schools are ekayāna schools. Of course, Tibetan Buddhists fetishize texts just the same way Nichiren Buddhists do, and so on do. We just fetishize different texts than you, for different reasons than yours.

That said, the only place where Mahāyāna Buddhists of different traditions can find common ground is in the discourses of Indian masters such as Nāgārjuna. This is why I prefer to keep discussions of Buddhist philosophy there. Similarly, while Continental Philosophy and the Anglo-American tradition do not share much in common, they both share a common history grounded in Plato, Aristotle, etc.

You will notice, I never bring Tibetan scholars into the mix. Why? Because like Chinese Buddhists, the Tibetans got involved in their own criteria and disputes about philosophy, which do not translate outside the Tibetan  Buddhist context; just as Chinese Buddhist disputes do not translate well outside that Chinese Buddhist context.

Therefore, if you want to have conversations with Buddhists outside of your particular silo, you need to educate yourself in Indian Buddhism in general, and Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism, which is the progenitor of all Mahāyāna Buddhism, everywhere it spread. If you don't do this, you will find your ability to carry on discussions with other Buddhists outside the Japanese traditions to be quite limited.

And you need some remedial English writing classes.

There is no common ground for this discussion of Two Truths v. Three Truths. It does not validate what you are trying to say about "relative grounded in absolute". Its not clear what your views on this actually are, so its hard to determine, but you do seem to have a quarrel with the way the Two Truths are generally understood in Buddhist discourse.

tkp67 said:
I believe they are since the two truths are a teaching to "become unconditioned" and the three are being taught to view the effect of that unconditioned state over the term of our own existence from end to end of the world honored one's existence. They both seem to be employed by a one vehicle teaching so are they conflicting or complementary?

Malcolm wrote:
The two truths describe how ordinary people falsely perceive the world on the one hand, and how awakened people on the bodhisattva stages correctly perceive the world on the other hand. That's all. End of story.

Zhiyi's three truths are a way of understanding the Nāgārjuna passage I posted yesterday—that is, a way of understanding what being empty, dependently designated, and the middle way means. It is useful for people who want to study these things to understand where they come from and their roots.

However, when we get right down to it, what is that which is empty, dependently designated and the middle way? Dependently originated phenomena, which are empty and dependently designated, and the middle way.

The whole point is that dependent origination is the middle way, the middle way between asserting existence or nonexistence with respect to phenomena. Because dependently originated phenomena are empty, they are free from the extreme of existence; because phenomena are dependently designated, they are free from the extreme of nonexistence. That is what it means to say that dependent origination is the middle way. So when we look at what Nāgārjuna is actually talking about in this passage, he is just talking about the central insight of the Buddha, dependent origination, and nothing more.

The main thing we need to understand in Buddhism is dependent origination, since dependent origination is the central theme of the Buddha's Dharma. If we do not understand dependent origination, we won't understand anything else of the Buddha's teaching. As the Buddha said, "Whoever sees dependent origination, sees the Dharma; whoever sees the Dharma, sees me."

So if we are going to discuss the role of truth in Buddhism, the role of truth in Buddhism is to discover the truth of dependent origination and nothing more.

Was not my intention to make this into a political argument...was looking for ideas/solutions to world poverty. For example, why couldn't we have an organization called something like "The Poverty Coalition" or something like that be created. Then bring all of the major 1st world nations, big business, donors and volunteers from all over the world  with the idea of "Give a man a fish, feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and feed him for a lifetime". In other words instead of shuffling people all over the planet start with the absolute poorest countries and help them build a sustainable infrastructure with decent jobs, training, education etc.  Make all of the major positions unpaid and have very strict oversight so that the money for the projects is not ripped off by greedy people.

When you show me a sūtra that teaches three truths, rather than two, that will be a different story. But such a sūtra does not exist. Thus the Buddha only taught two truths.

Now, with respect to the so-called "three truths," Nāgarjuna said:

Whatever arises in dependence
that is empty, 
that is dependently designated, 
that is the middle way.
Why? There exist no phenomena 
which do not originate dependently.
Therefore, there are no phenomena
which are not empty.

Now, I understand that Zhiyi took these three terms, and he decided that the middle way reconciled the first two terms. However, in reality, all three terms are merely synonyms for dependent origination. Whatever is dependently originated is empty and dependently designated, and that is the middle way. There is no need to call these "three truths." Buddhapalita (not a Tibetan) explains:

I explain that whatever arises dependently to be empty. That is dependently designated. That is the middle way. Therein, if there is some entity which exists, that is dependently originated and dependently designated. Why? Because there are no phenomena which are not dependently originated, therefore, there are no phenomena which are not empty.

"Emptiness," "dependent designation," and "middle way" are absolute synonyms for dependent origination. But this passage is not actually about the two truths at all, let alone three truths. This passage concerns the meaning of the profound truth that the Buddha taught, dependent origination, the madhyama-pratipad, i.e. the middle way, and nothing else.

This is removed from practice, but read Brook Ziporyn's H-net book review of Paul Swanson's translation of Zhiyi's great work Maka Shikan, Mohe Zhiguan Clear Serenity; Quiet Insight Below is an extract:
This way of reading the section shows us all the more how right Zhanran was to think that this is what is truly distinctive to the Tiantai exposition, particularly when viewed in light of the manner in which it is subsequently and separately joined to the demonstration in the following Emptiness section—where the same results are derived from the other direction, from Emptiness to Conventionality: Emptiness itself, considered alone, renders the full panoply of Conventionally definite entities (via the four siddhāntas)—and then how this relation between the Conventional and Emptiness is subsequently and separately what is invoked in the Middle section, in the form of a re-evocation and expansion of both sides and the second-order relation of undecidable reversibility between these two, which is what is meant by their mutual identity: annulling the separation only on the basis of having first posited it, and also preserving it in the indecidability of the result. It is in the Middle section that Zhiyi gives us, as Swanson correctly points out, the application of the usual third step to the exposition: in this case, showing that the two opposite Inconceivabilities of the prior two sections (i.e., from Conventionality to Emptiness and from Emptiness to Conventionality) are themselves reversible, are identical-as-different, another Mobius strip, introducing a new level of Inconceivability.

Tathāgatagarbha is a sūtra tradition, but in India, as far as we know, it never developed into a coherent philosophical school, likely due to the fact that post Tathāgatagarbha sūtras like the Lanka relegated tathāgatagarbha to the position of being a doctrine taught for people who were afraid of emptiness.

Thus, while Tibetan and Sino-Japanese schools raised the tathāgatagarbha theory to an elevated level of philosophical discourse, there is virtually no discussion of it in the classical Indian period apart from Maitreyanatha's survey text on tathāgatagarbha sūtras, the Uttaratantra and its commentary.

But what is interesting is that the Indian masters seemed completely disinterested in commenting on this scheme, and it was not adopted by all Tibetan scholars as meaningful. I think that this is because when you look at the claim that the third turning is substantially different in content, when the citation itself is examined, we find that all it really says is that the third turning is merely an emphatic restatement of the definitive context of the second turning.

Now, the reasoning portion: the idea that there are three truths, rather than two, also does not stand up to reasoning. Why? Truths are objects of cognitions. Cognitions are either veridical or nonveridical. Thus a relative truth is the object of a false cognition and an ultimate truth is an object of a veridical cognition. Since there are no objects of cognitions that are simultaneously false and veridical at one and the same time, a third truth does not exist.


tkp67 said:
For commoners such as we, the ultimate can be only be inferred through reasoning, since we have not had a direct perception of emptiness. So, it is quite the opposite: the ultimate depends on the relative, since it is only through analysis of relative truths that one arrives at ultimate truth. This is especially the case since the two truths are different ways of seeing conventionally-designated entities, one false, one true. However, both perceptions are based on examining relative entities that do not exist as ultimate. The ultimate itself is not something which is expressible in words. In other words, there is nothing that can be identified as the "absolute." Emptiness is also empty.

Phenomenological experience in the three truths models gives additional perspective in regards to relative and absolute. From the perspective of temporal existence provisional is only provisional in light of an absolute. There needs to be phenomenal impetus for the perception to polarize between relative and absolute. Both buddhism and science recognize more than 2 dimensions. Ergo the buddha of the ten directions and three times. Even on a genetic level our individual genetic existence itself is a provision of a greater cause which is the human genome. Flat linear perspectives on consciousness seem askew to the topology of conscious structures and physical ones alike.

But there is no such thing as an ultimate that exists separate from a relative entity. There is no polarization between relative truth and ultimate truth. Relative truth is a truth about a thing prior to analysis, for example, stating, "This is a car." If you and another person perceive the same car, this is relative truth. When both of you analyze the car, you will both find there is no car either in the parts, in one of the parts, or separate from the parts. There is a seven-fold analysis used by Candrakīrit to illustrate this.

Indeed, the problems arise when people begin to hypostasize the two truths, as if they are somehow independent domains. They are not. All entities bear two natures, one relative, the other ultimate. Why? Because all phenomena are empty. As the Heart Sūtra states,  "Matter is empty, emptiness is matter; there is no matter apart from emptiness, and no emptiness apart from matter" and so on for the rest of the aggregates, etc.

The Buddha explained his definitive Mahāyāna teachings in terms of the two truths. As Nāgārjuna puts it:

The doctrine of the buddhas
truly relies on two truths:
the relative truth of the worldly
and the ultimate truth of the sublime.
Those who do not understand
the distinction between the two truths
do not know the profundity
of the doctrine of the buddhas.

So, that's it. You can either accept the Nāgārjuna's word, and devote oneself to the study of the true intention of the Buddha, or you can waste time chasing mirages. Not only this, but a third truth is emphatically denied in Madhyamaka, so whatever reason Zhiyi had for concocting a third truth in the Chinese Buddhist context, it is irrelevant to Madhyamaka proper. For this reason, Chandrakīrti refers to the Sūtra on the Meeting of the Father and the Son (Āryapitāputrasamāgamananāmamahāyānasūtra):

The truth of the knower of the world
was seen for yourself, not received from another.
Those are relative and ultimate:
there is no third truth.

Thus, within weeks of taking up the study and practice of Buddhism, I made far more spiritual progress than I had, doing likewise with Hinduism for several years. It’s not that I think Buddhism is better than Hinduism, it’s just that Buddhism is resonating powerfully for me, spiritually.

Phenomenological experience in the three truths models gives additional perspective in regards to relative and absolute. From the perspective of temporal existence provisional is only provisional in light of an absolute. There needs to be phenomenal impetus for the perception to polarize between relative and absolute. Both buddhism and science recognize more than 2 dimensions. Ergo the buddha of the ten directions and three times. Even on a genetic level our individual genetic existence itself is a provision of a greater cause which is the human genome.

"Barring a shock to the system, Democrats recapture the presidency. The leaking of the Trump campaign’s internal polling has somewhat softened the blow of this forecast, as that polling reaffirms what my model already knew: Trump’s 2016 path to the White House, which was the political equivalent of getting dealt a Royal Flush in poker, is probably not replicable in 2020 with an agitated Democratic electorate. And that is really bad news for Donald Trump because the Blue Wall of the Midwest was then, and is now, the ONLY viable path for Trump to win the White House.

Why is Trump in so much trouble in the Midwest? First, and probably most important, is the profound misunderstanding by, well, almost everyone, as to how he won Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania in the first place. Ask anyone, and they will describe Trump’s 2016 Midwestern triumph as a product of white, working class voters swinging away from the Democrats based on the appeal of Trump’s economic populist messaging. Some will point to survey data of disaffected Obama-to-Trump voters and even Sanders-to-Trump voters as evidence that this populist appeal was the decisive factor. And this is sort of true. In Ohio, Trump managed the rare feat of cracking 50%. Elsewhere, that explanation runs into empirical problems when one digs into the data. Start with the numerical fact that Trump “won” Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Michigan with 47.22%, 48.18%, and 47.5% of the vote, respectively, after five times the normal number in those states cast their ballots for an option other than Trump or Clinton. This, combined with the depressed turnout of African Americans (targeted with suppression materials by the Russians) and left-leaning Independents turned off by Clinton (targeted with defection materials by the Russians) allowed Trump to pull off an improbable victory, one that will be hard to replicate in today’s less nitpicky atmosphere. Yet, the media (and the voting public) has turned Trump’s 2016 win into a mythic legend of invincibility. The complacent electorate of 2016, who were convinced Trump would never be president, has been replaced with the terrified electorate of 2020, who are convinced he’s the Terminator and can’t be stopped. Under my model, that distinction is not only important, it is everything."

However, apart from that, Śantarakṣita never uses any specifically yogacāra concepts such as the all-basis consciousness, the three natures, etc. in the course of his treatise.

When discussing the relative truth, Candra again divides this into a functional relative, and a nonfunctional relative: the former being conventional truths upon which we all agree, such as the earth being round; as opposed to the false relative, the belief that the earth is flat.

Candra's definition of conventional depends on the notion of functionality (ārthakriya).

Two Models of the Two Truths: Ontologicaland Phenomenological Approaches

Malcolm wrote:
Not really. You first need to understand the context and long history of Tibetan attempts to reconcile Madhyamaka and Yogacāra. It is not sufficient to do a google search and come up with some paper written by a scholar, no matter how respected, on an issue about which there is serious and deep differences of opinion in Tibet, even within the Nyingma school itself. For example. MIpham's novelties would never be accepted by earlier Nyingma scholars, such as Longchenpa (14th century) or Rongzompa (who was himself a famous translator living in the 12th century).

In the case of Mipham, he tries to reconcile Yogacāra with  Madhyamaka by resorting to various strategies, chief among them, altering Tibetan terms of translated Sanskrit terms in ways that could never be accepted by Indians. For example, in Mipham's commentary on the Dharmadharmatāvibhanga, "Distinguishing Phenomena and their Nature," he argues by that changing the term rnam par rig pa to rnam par snang ba, that this text could be rendered compatible with Madhyamaka. There are two points here: Mipham occasionally tries to reconcile Yogacāra with Madhyamaka in his writings, but he never makes any attempt to reconcile Madhyamaka with Yogacāra. In doing so, he resorts to linguistics tactics, such as the one mentioned above. The problem with this is that "rnam par rig pa" is a translation of the Sanskrit term "vijñapti," a term used again and again in the Dharmadharmatāvibhanga. This term means "cognition," and a principle of the Yogacāra school is that "everything is cognition only." But there is no corresponding Sanskrit philosophical term for "rnam par snang ba," which would mean that "everything is appearance only." So while his attempt is clever, and makes sense in Tibetan, it does not withstand critique, because this term would never be used by the actual exponents of the Dharmadharmatāvibhanga and it does not make sense in Sanskrit.

Moreover, it would not stand because in all the philosophical texts of the Great Perfection system, Yogacāra is systematically relegated to a position below that of Madhyamaka, not to mention that in canonical texts such as the Hevajra Tantra, Yogacāra is relegated to a position inferior to Madhyamaka.

However, from the Dzogchen or Great Perfection point of view, both Madhyamaka and Yogacāra contain errors in approach. The former is considered erroneous because some Madhyamakas understand the two truths to be separate entities, a Great Perfection commentary rejects Madhyamaka deviations in the following way: "Because the true state of the mind is beyond dualistic objects, non-arising dharmatā, (liberated from eight extremes in the essence of the inherently inseparable two truths) is free from the proclamation of being the best view because of illusion."

The same commentary rejects Yogacāra deviations in the following way: "Because atiyoga (aka great perfection) is true, undeluded about everything, the vijñāptimatra understanding of things as reflections of delusion and the view attained through that is a conceptual imputation of their own."

However, most Nyingma scholars today consider that the Prasanga variety of Madhyamaka is both the purest expression of Madhyamaka, mirroring the real intent of Nāgārjuna, and free from the various misunderstandings that plagued earlier Tibetan attempts to understand Madhyamaka following the collapse of the Tibetan empire in the mid 9th century and prior to the introduction of works of Candrakīrti to Tibet in the early 12th century.

Malcolm wrote:
You cannot become the disciple of a Vajrayāna guru without receiving empowerment from that person. There is a transitive property in lineages where by taking empowerment from lama b, you also have a disciple relationship with their lama, lama a. For example, if you receive an empowerment of Vajrakilaya from HH Sakya Trizin Ratnavajra, you automatically have a samaya relationship with his father, HH Sakya Trichen, as a lineage guru.

Attending an empowerment is considered meeting them, whether or not you have a personal relationship with them.

If the two truths are subject to interpretation, and there is more than one way of presenting them, then they are not the two “truths.” Among Madhyamikas, there are slight pedagogical differences in presenting relative truth, depending on whether we are addressing nonbuddhists or buddhists, but among madhyamikas, there are no real differences when it come to the meaning of the two truths.

The whole point of the Buddha teaching the five aggregates was to defeat the notion that there is a single entity which constitutes a person. There is no single entity in which there is obfuscation or lack of obfuscation. The five aggregates cannot be construed to be a single entity, otherwise, they would not have the name "five aggregates." Actually, the five aggregates are the five sense organs, the five sense objects, fifty four mental factors (when sensation and perception are included), and consciousness, for a total of 65 separate factors (and if you add the four primary elements and the eleven derived elements, there are a total of 80 separate factors).

You continue to reference a "buddhanature," but it is not at all clear what you mean by the term. If buddhanature is conceived as a real entity encased with impurities, etc. this is a provisional view at best and a wrong view at worst. If, on the other hand, it is understood as the potential for sentient beings to wake up and realize buddhahood, then this is a correct view. In some presentations, buddhanature is equated with the luminous original nature of the mind, but this term "luminous" is actually just a synonym of emptiness, and refers to the intrinsic purity of all phenomena. Because of that intrinsic purity, we all have the potential to realize that intrinsic purity and wake up.

Greggorious said:
I’m aware that some Buddhist traditions stress eyes closed, others eyes open, and others leave it up to you. I’m also aware that Soto Zen is in the eyes open category. Now, I don’t have an issue with this in principle, but I have very sensitive eyes, I blink excessively and my eyes itch a lot when I’m sitting there gazing at the wall. Would it be “sacrilegious” for me to close my eyes during Zazen? I’ve occasionally gone to meditation at a Theravada Temple simply cos they allow you to close your eyes, and not because I prefer that school of Buddhism. A lot of the time when I donit with eyes open my eyes start getting very irritated and then I get pissed off and disillusioned with practice.
I understand the why it’s stressed to have eyes open, as it stops you falling asleep, and Zazen is an open meditation rather than closing off, but still, I’m not sure what to do. If it’s a rule that I HAVE to always have my eyes open then I may well swap traditions, again, not because I want to, but because it would just be more practical for my needs.

The value of things purchased always exceeds the value of things obtained for free. The culture of patronage, in many ways, is far less honest and far more corruptible than the fee for service culture, which in fact is the defacto model Tibetan Buddhism actually runs on and always has.

In Buddhist history, patrons have had inordinate input on just what Dharma gets promulgated, and that has not always been kind to Dzogchen teachings, not to mention Vajrayana in SE Asia, etc.

If you try to buy books from the BDK, you have to pay for them. If you want to download the PDF, well, that is "free."

I don't know much about Bon or Shugendo but from the little I do know, it has occurred to me that their relationships to Buddhism, particularly Vajrayana, occupy similar spaces. With regard to Shugendo, it seems that some of it appears to be expressions of Tantric yogic practices that utilize teachings on Three Mysteries, etc.

Malcolm wrote:
The main difference seems to be, that where the Bonpos revealed an entire religion which is analogous in every respect to modern Tibetan Buddhism, with a vast literature containing sutras, tantras, vinaya, and so on; Shugendo seems to have existed on the margins of Japanese religious life, and seemingly never developed a major independent literature.

I don't know. It's up to you if you want to correct me or not. I said "should," but that was just my opinion. You are your own person.

That's what I think about Shugendō, having only read a few sources. I have opinions about Manichaeans too, but have only read a few sources about their religion as well. It's on the forum and public, my opinions about Shugendō. If you want to post something that says something different about Shugendō, it's up to you.
"Shugendo has long been a neglected topic in the field of Japanese historical and religious studies in the west, which is in turn a reflection of Japanese academic attitudes."
Shugendo is notoriously difficult to define and there is a continual seepage of topics between it and other areas, such as divinity cults, female exclusion from sacred sites (nyonin kinsei), pilgrimage practices, magico-religious rituals, and in recent years, ecological concerns. Shugendo was not studied extensively even in Japan until thepost-war period, and despite what has been written above, still lingers today under a cloud in some parts of academia, where certain scholars continue to share Anesaki’s opinion that it is superstitious, syncretic, and somehow disreputable, and so not worth serious attention. This is due inpart to the fact that Shugendo was banned in 1872 for its eclecticism by a reformist government anxious to be perceived as having shed the shackles of a ‘feudal’ or benighted past. Shugendo priests were given the choice of becoming (Shinto) shrine priests or fully ordained priests within the tradition (Tendai or Shingon) to which their institutions had been affiliated,or giving up their religious role completely (see Sekimori 2000, 2005b).The very small number (less then ten per cent) who joined Buddhist institutions found themselves ranked inferior to regular priests and encouraged to integrate with their new sects rather than try to maintain their Shugendo traditions: initially, they were forbidden to wear their distinctive robes, to perform Shugendo-style rituals and to conduct Shugendo-related activities.

Malcolm wrote:
https://www.academia.edu/8006649/Shugendo_Japanese_Mountain_Religion_-_State_of_the_Field_and_Bibliographic_Review

In short, Shugendo is an indigenous religion, with elements borrowed from other traditions, which suffered from repression.

But this is merely the starting point.

The deeper point is to continually meditate on which approach will actually liberate you. It sounds to me like you are gaining confidence that you have a true answer to this, and this at least part of your sense that other ways are redundant.

Prolonged dependent origination means that ignorance and formations are the affliction and karma of the past life, which act as causes for this life. Consciousness through sensation are the result in this life, suffering. Craving and addiction are the causal afflictions in this life; becoming is karma. These three act as the cause for the suffering of the next life: birth, and aging and death.

You should look at Abhidharmakośabhasyaṃ (Pruden), pp. 410-437 for further explanations of the other three kinds.

The best place is chapter 3 of the Abhidharmakośabhasyaṃ. There are four interlocking schemes: static dependent origination, serial dependent origination, prolonged dependent origination, and momentary dependent origination.

Prolonged dependent origination means that ignorance and formations are the affliction and karma of the past life, which act as causes for this life. Consciousness through sensation are the result in this life, suffering. Craving and addiction are the causal afflictions in this life; becoming is karma. These three act as the cause for the suffering of the next life: birth, and aging and death.

You should look at Abhidharmakośabhasyaṃ (Pruden), pp. 410-437 for further explanations of the other three kinds.

Ignorance refers to the state of being afflicted. Formations refers to the karmas that are motivated by affliction.

Basically, all terms of the twelve links of dependent origination can be boiled down to affliction, action, and suffering.

I'd like to have a detailed discussion on how karma works.

I can understand cause and effect. That nothing happens in a vacuum and your actions will somehow come back to you like an echo when you shout inside a large hall.

What I can't wrap my head around is how karma is individual and how your karma is supposed to maintain the cycle of samsara. It seems to contradict impermanence and non-self in my head. Also, how does the individual being not disperse at death?

I see our lives as like waves on the ocean, each wave being a separate phenomena or dharma. while we exist as long as conditions are favorable as some sort of continuum, like the waves travelling through the environment, there comes a point where all phenomena no longer have the energy to be maintained and hence disperse.

Looking forward to some engaging discussion on this topic

I think a logician could easily infer that the classic analysis of particles leads to the view that forms are, in theory, infinitely decomposable. Although, perhaps knowing that is not particularly useful from a Buddhist perspective.
So they are infinitely decomposable according to the theory that denies the existence of a partless particle, but there is some kind of limit on how far down we can decompose a substance, stopping at subtle particles. Is the limit imposed by tradition, or is there some kind of knowledge limit, or something else?

Sometimes this was against his wishes—when discussing his first budget, Clinton famously complained, “You mean to tell me that the success of my economic program and my reelection hinges on the Federal Reserve and a bunch of frak bond traders?” But it also became a central feature of Clintonism. This economic straitjacket was the result of a fight that had started decades before. After the Great Depression and the Second World War, classical laissez-faire economics had been profoundly discredited, and the Democratic Party had come to accept that strict controls on the markets and protections for workers—in the form of pro-union legislation, the regulatory state, antitrust policy, and so on—were needed to moderate the ruthless swings of capitalism." https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/the-rise-and-fall-of-clintonism/

Well, this is how it is defined in classical buddhist literature, where, for example, Vasubandhu describes "dhātu", in the term dharmadhātu, as being like a mine.

The festival of Buddha's descent from the Trayastrimsa heaven was known in China and Tibet. They certainly got it from the schools they were in contact with in India.

According to Etienne Lamotte the Vibhasa (a Sarvastivadin buddhist encyclopedia) laments that many sutras have been lost and little remains, the Ekottara Agama originally  went from 1 to 100, now we have only the sutras from 1 to 10. One of the disappeared sutras must be the one about the Buddha's visit to the Trayastrimsa heaven.

The tradition also tells that when the disciple of Ananda died, 9000 works of Abhidharma disappeared from the world with him. They were still held in memory at the time, and not yet written down. This is also from  Lamotte's History of Indian Buddhism.

All of this means that  Buddha's visit to Trayastrimsa remained as a story held in memory by some people, when it was no longer found in the sutras. It must have been an impressive tradition as the actual jewel ladders were still found at the time of King Ashoka, or a lower portion of the jewel ladders!

The Chinese pigrims Fa Xian and Hsuanzang have described the place of Sankashya, and it most certainly was outside of the theravada-land at that time:

"The Chinese pilgrims describe further stupas and a chankramana where Shakyamuni and the previous buddhas had walked and sat in meditation.
The three flights of stairs disappeared into the ground, but for seven steps of each, which remained above. When Ashoka came here later he had men dig into the earth around the protrusions in order to discover their depth. Although they reached the level of water, they could not find the stairs' end. With increased faith, Ashoka then built a temple over them with a standing image of the Buddha above the middle flight. Behind this temple he erected a great pillar surmounted by an elephant capital. Because the tail and trunk had been destroyed, both Chinese pilgrims mistook this for a lion.

"Hsuan Zang tells that the original stairs had existed until a few centuries before his visit, when they disappeared. Various kings built replicas of ornamented brick and stone, with a temple containing images of Shakyamuni, Brahma and Indra above them. These were within the walls of a monastery, which he describes as excellently ornamented and having many fine images. He further says that some hundreds of monks dwelt there and that the community had lay followers. Two centuries earlier Fa Hsien found roughly 1,000 monks and nuns living here pursuing their studies, some hinayana and some mahayana. Both pilgrims tell stories of a white-eared dragon who lived close to the monastery, caring for it and the surrounding area. Fa Hsien especially remarks on the abundant produce of the land and the prosperity and happiness of the people."

"Some say that during his forty-first year Shakyamuni went up from Shravasti to the Tushita Heaven and passed the rainy season retreat teaching Abhidharma to his mother, Queen Mayadevi, who had died seven days after Buddha's birth and been reborn as a male god in Tushita. The same happens to the mothers of all the buddhas, and they too later go to teach them, afterwards descending to Sankashya."

"Seven days before his descent the Buddha set aside his invisibility. Anuruddha perceived him by his divine sight and urged Maudgalyayana to go and greet him. The great disciple did so, telling the Buddha that the Order longed to see him. This was the time Prasenajit's statue was made. Shakyamuni replied that in seven days he would return to the world. A great assembly of the kings and people of the eight kingdoms gathered. As the Buddha descended, a flight of gold stairs appeared, down which he came. He was accompanied on the right by Brahma, who, holding a white chowny, descended on a crystal staircase, while to the left Indra came down a flight of silver stairs, holding a jewelled umbrella. A great host of gods followed."a

My point is that even a 'formless being' need's some sort of substratum to maintain its consciousness.

Our consciousnesses are distinct because we apprehend them as a self and what belongs to a self.

My current point of view is that our consciousness is separate because it's an internal process (occurring in a brain), that it needs the brain (as one condition) to manifest consciousness. No brain. No consciousness.

You can't cut yourself up apart from anything and claim "This is not going to disperse".

Malcolm wrote:
Since there is never a time when we did not have the innate grasping of our continuum as a self, it has always been distinct, since there is no beginning of consciousness or anything else. The logic of dependent origination forbids any sort of first cause or prime mover-- all causes are effects, and all effects are causes in their turn. Our consciousnesses are distinct because we apprehend them as a self and what belongs to a self. But the more practical point is this-- my karma is my karma and ripens on me alone, even after I attain realization and until buddhahood is attained. One cannot speak of what happens to a buddha's mind after the breakup of their aggregates, since this is one of the 14 questions to which the Buddha refused to respond. When I taste a lemon, there is no taste of sour in your mouth. This is because our psycho-physical continuums are distinct, with distinct physical and mental sense organs, etc. Even when the aggregates break up at death, because of the innate grasping to self, the mind immediately appropriates a new series of aggregates. This is why the aggregates are referred to in Sanskrit as upādāna-skandhas, addictive aggregates—we appropriate them because we are addicted to the three afflictions, driven by the obscuration of knowledge that is the innate grasping to I, me, and mine. Even tenth stage bodhisattvas, while they are not subject to birth in the three realms, still have the knowledge obscuration, the most subtle grasping to "I, me, mine."

Each wave needs the entirety of the rest of the ocean to manifest itself and in some sense IS the entire ocean from the relative point of view of that wave. but when conditions change enough then the wave disperses; it recedes back into the mass and that (particular) wave will never come back.

That’s when she nailed almost to the number the nature and size of the Democrats’ win in the House, even as other forecasters went wobbly in the race’s final days. Not only that, but she put out her forecast back in July, and then stuck by it while polling shifted throughout the summer and fall.

And today her model tells her the Democrats are a near lock for the presidency in 2020, and are likely to gain House seats and have a decent shot at retaking the Senate. If she’s right, we are now in a post-economy, post-incumbency, post record-while-in-office era of politics. Her analysis, as Bitecofer puts it with characteristic immodesty, amounts to nothing less than “flipping giant paradigms of electoral theory upside down.”

Malcolm wrote:
For the most part, there is no meaningful difference between bulk of teachings of Tibetan Buddhist schools. They are all Mulasarvāstivādin from the point of view of ordination; from the point of view of path, they are all Mahāyāna; and they all claim to be Prasanga Madhyamaka in intellectual orientation—though Karma Kagyu and Jonang might considered outliers, they still claim they adhere to Madhyamaka.

The principle difference between Tibetan schools is what Vajrayāna traditions they adhere too. But even this is misleading, since Sakya, Kagyu and Jonang, largely base their teachings on the late Nalanda tradition and the Vajrayāna practitioners who associated with this university, such as Naropa, Ratnakarashanti, etc. While Nyingmapas follow earlier Vajrayāna traditions, they too are based on Nalanda Buddhism. Geluk is based principally on the Sakya and the (now defunct) Kadampa schools.

Thus, in terms of the  vast majority of teachings, the four or five schools of Tibetan Buddhism are much more similar than they are different.

The academic curriculum of Modern Tibetan Buddhism is based on Mulasarvāstivādin Vinaya, Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma, Perfection of Wisdom Sūtras, Madhyamaka, and some study of Yogacāra. However, the dominant influence in Tibetan Buddhism is Nāgārjuna, and anything that does not comport with Nāgārjuna is considered wrong or inferior view.

In short, trying to tell a Tibetan Buddhist they do not belong to the Madhyamaka school is like trying to tell Chan and Zen Buddhists they do not follow Bodhidharma. You are not going to get very far with that claim.

These statements are leaving you all with very absurd consequences.

Let's take for a moment nirvana with remainder. What remains? The rupaskandha (until death). What has ceased? The namaskandhas, and the afflictions which depend upon them.

By the logic of Malcom, Smcj, Virgo etc, when one attains nirvana with remainder - such as the Buddha did upon his awakening - there are no siddhis, there is no wisdom, there is no enlightened speech, no enlightened qualities at all. Only an afflicted body....and the complete none-existence of anything like 'awakened mind' 'prajna' 'karuna' 'maitri' etc. In this case, the Buddha would be nothing other than a 'dead/non-existent' mind and an existent, afflicted body. Truly absurd.

One does not fall into eternalism to assert that nirvana is a realisation which has very subtle but indescribable qualities. However, one does fall into nihilism when one asserts that the extinction of kleshas is the extinction of everything.

Malcolm wrote:
Ummm....no. Your rebuttal is way, way, off the mark. First of all, your objection confuses the position concerning the cessation that the highest tenet system of Hinayana holds, vs. our own personal understandings of these issues in a Mahayana context.

Second my remarks never addressed nirvana with remainder, but were strictly confined to what nirvana without remainder meant, and I referenced a Sutta in the Sutta Nipata which directly addresses the issue of what one may say about an arhat whose aggregates have broken up—nothing at all is the answer—and why.

The issue of what Buddhas and arhats experience while they are alive, according to shravakas,  is an entirely separate topic.

From a Mahayana point of view, nonarising and unceasing have a completely different meaning than they do from a Hinayana point of view.

So you're talking about the nature of cessation itself; but this reifies a process, because cessation cannot be thought of independently from something which abides. i.e it is the end of that thing abiding.

What is the end of klesha? It ceases. It doesn't follow that there now can't be a mind without that klesha. That is a mere metaphysical claim. Maybe its right, maybe its wrong.

So your point only applies to the cessation itself, and by extension to the abiding things (skandhas etc) which have ceased. It says nothing about the process of a yogi moving through the jhanas and into the final attainment.

Malcolm wrote:
When the series of aggregates driven by afflictions ceases because the afflictions are uprooted and there is no more birth in the three realms (because there is no more birth), this is the extreme of cessation referred to when in Mahayana we refer to samsara and nirvana as extremes.

When there is no birth, there is no death. When there is no existence, there is peace.

Title: Abhidharmakośabhaṣyaṃ and origin controversies
Content:



Aemilius said:
Vasubandhu writes in Abhidharmakosa-bhasyam page 58 about the origin of Abhidharma (and the views of different schools on it):
"However, the Vaibhashikas explain, the Blessed One spoke Abhidharma in fragments. And in the same as Sthavira Dharmatrata made a collection of Udanas scattered throughout the scriptures, -the Udanavarga (the larger original Dharmapada)-, in this same way the Aryan Katyayaniputra and the other Saints established the Abhidharma (by collecting it into seven Abhidharmas)."

Malcolm wrote:
However, Vasubandhu is merely reporting an opinion that he does not accept, which is clarified by Valle-Poussin in footnote 16, pg. 133: "The word kila shows that Vasubandhu presents here an opinion...that he does not accept. The Abhidharma treatises are not the word of the Master for the Sautrāntikas and for Vasubandhu."

Aemilius said:
I don't buy that. Before the quoted passage from Bhashyam, Vasubandhu explains even more strongly why Abhidharma was taught by the Bhagavan, his reasoning goes: "To attain enlightenment it is necessary to know the Abhidharma, the Bhagavan Shakyamuni gave his disciples the Doctrine that leads to perfect enlightenment. Therefore he taught the Abhidharma."
If this is merely the view of the Sarvastivadins, he explains it very clearly, and he also omits mentioning the opposing views.

Poussin writes on page 17 that Sarvastivadins accept the seven Abhidharma treatises as word of the Buddha. On pages 18...20 Poussin explains in detail the argument in Vibhasha how Abhidharma is the word of the Buddha.
I think that Abhidharma carries the spiritual authority of the Buddha, as the Vaibhashikas say.

Why should we discard the very nice miracle of Shakyamuni, when he descended on three kinds of stairs from the Trayastrimsa  heaven accompanied by Brahma and Indra, after having taught Abhidharma for his mother (who was reborn there as a deity).

Malcolm wrote:
1) It is very clear the Sautrāntikas do not accept the Abhidharma treatises of the Sarvāstivādins to be word of the Buddha. If they did, there would be no basis for dispute.  This does not however prevent them from accepting that the Buddha taught a subject called "abhidharma," scattered throughout the Agamas.

2) The Sarvāstivādins are forced, in the Mahāvibhāṣā, to reconcile the composition of the treatises of Abhidharma by arhats, with the claim that they are also the word of the Buddha. On pg. 19, the Vibhāṣā is quoted, "If this is the case, why does the tradition attribute the writing down of this treatise [the Jñānaprasthāna] to the Āryan Kātyāniputra?" After claiming that the this treatises was indeed the word of the Buddha, the respondent also admits that according to another opinion, the Jñānaprasthāna is just the work of the Āryan Kātyāniputra. Thus, our Vaibhāṣika author attempts to conclude that while the Abhidharma is the word of the Buddha, it is also the work of Āryan Kātyāniputra.

But if we accept this to be case, this is very problematical, because of the number of places in the treatise where Vasubandhu refutes theories which, according to your view, would be theories originally enunciated by the Buddha, thus leaving open the claim that Vasubandhu was rejecting the Dharma.

Further, on pg. 36, Poussin lays out the position of the Sautrāntikas in eleven points of difference, the first of which is the rejection of the authority of the Sarvāstivādin Abhidharma.

The notion that the Buddha taught Abdhidharma to the devas in the desire realm is a Pali tradition connected with the Abhidhamma Pitika, and has no corresponding analogue in Indian Buddhism.

Now, generally speaking, the Sautrāntikas are held to be the higher tenet system, and therefor, in Mahāyāna we also do not accept the authority of the Sarvāstivādin Abhidharma. Further, Mahāyāna has its own Abhidharma, in the form of the now lost Abhidharma Sūtra.

He bases his argument, as far as I recall, On some very elusive passages in the Pali suttas. But the sautrantikas still argue that nirvana is unreal, whether you like it or not.

The official UN estimate is that 17 million people died in the slave trade. Given that the population of Africa seems to have declined slightly btween 1600 and 1800, while the population of Europe and Asia doubled in the same period, some people estimate that perhaps as many as 60 million Africans were killed in the slave trade during this period.

This is apropos, because you invoked sutra in defense of your claim that shravakas do not seek a kind of total cessation.

Aemilius said:
Vasubandhu writes in Abhidharmakosa-bhasyam page 58 about the origin of Abhidharma (and the views of different schools on it):
"However, the Vaibhashikas explain, the Blessed One spoke Abhidharma in fragments. And in the same as Sthavira Dharmatrata made a collection of Udanas scattered throughout the scriptures, -the Udanavarga (the larger original Dharmapada)-, in this same way the Aryan Katyayaniputra and the other Saints established the Abhidharma (by collecting it into seven Abhidharmas)."

Malcolm wrote:
However, Vasubandhu is merely reporting an opinion that he does not accept, which is clarified by Valle-Poussin in footnote 16, pg. 133: "The word kila shows that Vasubandhu presents here an opinion...that he does not accept. The Abhidharma treatises are not the word of the Master for the Sautrāntikas and for Vasubandhu."

I deeply suspect that if there were practicing Sautrantikas around to speak for themselves, none of them would assert that they are aiming for total extinction.

In any case, if we remain purely with the statement, it does not follow that they are asserting that the non-causality and unreality of nirvana is equivocal to the teleological aim of pure extinction. Given that they are suspicious of the Abhidharma and attempting to ground their practice in sutta, it seems far more likely to me that they are making much of the Buddha's silences and refusals on core metaphysical topics/questions. And this opens up a space for what nirvana may be, beyond philosophy and words, rather than shutting it down into some absolutist position.

Karl B., is a serious scholar, but he is also playing team sports, since even he admits that the way gzhan stong pas use Yyogacāra material is not consistent with the way the founders (Maitrya, Asanga, Vasybandhu) of yogacāra use it. There is a place for both, but most of Buddhists are not serious scholars, and only play team sports for the views promulgated as official in their school. This is why I personally abandoned paying too much mind to what Tibetans had to say about madhyamaka, and exclusively rely on what can be discerned in the authentic treatises of the founders of these two systems, madhyamaka and yogacāra, and free of the largely Tibetan historical interpretation of Buddhist doctrine through the lens of the three turnings, a lens entirely neglected by Indian masters.

This won't work with Dzogchen by the way, where a hard distinction is made between snang ba (appearances), subjective experience, and snang yul, objective appearance (apparent objects).

You seem to be using “experience” in place of “direct perception”. But this is an error, experiences are second order cognitions.

For example, a taste of sweet is not an experience of sweet until it is categorized as such.

Ālaya is actually just a name for ignorance, in the system of Dzogchen. And this is made extremely clear in all the commentaries that bear on the issue.

But perhaps what you mean to refer to is the ālaya, aka the nature of the mind, which is the inseparable clarity and emptiness taught in the Kagyu and Sakyapa schools. If this is the case, while clarity of course can be recognized, this is not the ālaya being spoken of in Dzogchen teachings, which is the subject of this discussion.

In this case, the ālaya and the dharmakāya can only be differentiated or distinguished by a person who attains complete and total buddhahood in this life, at the time they attain complete and total buddhahood. This is discussed somewhat extensively by Vimalamitra in his commentary on the Blazing Lamp Tantra.

The collection of the raw data is also a problem, I mean, the actual collection and archiving of it by companies is a problem in the first place, but that'd veer into the whole surveillance capitalism end of the discussion.

They are different problems related to the same issue. Obama era NSA surveillance for instance was not targeting any group, Trump is. The biggest issue with the NSA surveillance was in fact that it was so indiscriminate. So both can be, are, and were problems, they are in no way, shape or form mutually exclusive. Most groups that specialize in law and issue surrounding such things (FTFF, EFF, EPIC, ACLU and others) would indeed echo the idea that both dragnet surveillance and targetting of specifics groups is an issue, which is exactly why a lot of this stuff should simply be illegal for anyone to do, and we should accept that the only way to maintain some sense of human dignity in the midst of these surveillance capabilities is to allow (for instance) encryption which the government cannot easily break, and to make it a serious crime for governments or corporations to toy with people in this way. It's related to executive power also, which was mentioned earlier.

Obviously, Trumps use is related to his desire to further disenfranchise some of the most vulnerable people on the hemisphere, which makes it ugly in a particular way, but it's -all- a problem, not an either or situation.

Malcolm wrote:
We already have encryption which is virtually impossible to break. But it places a serious burden on bandwidth, and so therefore people don’t like to use it. It is also clumsy, and most people feel that it isn’t worth it because they feel they’ve nothing to hide. Encryption is covered under munition laws.

The reason why the NSA Hoover data is that there are no laws against it. As I said, all of this data is public, and anyone can collect it. Want to change that, you’ll have to change the laws, but good luck, because it will be immediately challenged under the first amendment, because ironically, passing such laws will also make it illegal for reporters to report on open mic comments.

Btw, Snowden did not report anything we already didn’t know. He is a libertarian nut driven by an intense hatred of Obama. Let him rot in Russia, he is not a hero.

"Soul" is a mental construct, the very vagueness of which has ensured its continuance. Although the modern-day Catholics may or may not define it as consciousness, this was assuredly not the case 1000 years ago. Nor is the present understanding of the word an easy match, semantically or from a historical viewpoint, with the Greek and Latin words it was supposedly derived from and equivalent to. Cross-cultural comparisons of words that have vague meanings and wildly different histories is probably a mug's game unless one wants to get very very specific about defining terms.

The Tibetan word "la" (bla) is often translated as "soul", and, nowadays, Bonpos sometimes substitute namshe for it, but it was sufficiently different in meaning 1200 years ago for the creators of Tibetan/Sankrit translation equivalences refused to admit "la" (in the old meaning) to their lexicon at all.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, and citing your reasoning above, soul a bad translation of bla, especially under its old meaning. In modern parlance among Buddhists, it’s usually held to a be a synonym of “tshe”, longevity.

Right. So it is the horrible ends the surveillance is getting used for that is your principle beef here, rather than the surveillance itself. Or both? The applications are new, the surveillance hardly so, AFAICT.

As for your "not really", yes, I would say 'really'. Heard of Edward Snowden? Recently he said this:
I mean, this is a — it’s tremendously unpopular, I think, even still today, for anybody to say a bad word about Obama, because, on balance, when you look at a lot of the things that came out of the Obama White House, this is a man that I think most believe tried to do good.
The thing is, some of the things that he failed to do were the most consequential moments of his presidency. And what we saw is that a young senator, who campaigned on a platform of ending mass surveillance, saying, “There will be no more warrantless wiretapping in the United States. That’s not what we do. That’s not who we are,” once he sat in the chair himself, did not extinguish the program; rather, he extended and embraced it — a president who said he was going to hold Bush-era officials to the account of the law and make sure that there was accountability for those who had engaged in war crimes, for those who had tortured, and then very quickly abandoned that. I’m not going to say why, because I don’t know. I think that’s something that he’s going to have to answer to history. But I think our country has very much, I think, experienced the consequences of those decisions.

Astus said:
It makes more sense as long as the world is conceived from an etic perspective, but if we move to the subjective side of how phenomena appear as the basis, then there is no need for the abstraction of unseen elements as producers of appearances. Even if the standard description is followed, the moment of awareness is after contact happened, so it could also be said that talking of experience as the basis is simply moving the focus, if one wants to maintain the established explanation. Also, taking the instance of consciousness as the basis of epistemological theory is the common approach already, furthermore, it can be said to be simply an argument for the topic of appearances are mind. To quote Thrangu Rinpoche again:

"Normally when we think about things we regard that which appears to us externally as composed of particles, and therefore as made up of matter, and we regard our cognition or our mind as a mere cognitive clarity or awareness and therefore as fundamentally different in nature from what we experience or what appears to us. But if we analyze carefully how we experience, we will see that what appears to us are actually fixated images created by our minds through taking many things together and designating them as units with certain designated characteristics. If you analyze the objective bases in physical reality for these designated images — and it is the designated images which we experience, not the objective bases — then you determine that the objective bases themselves, while apparently composed of particles, are actually composed of particles that when analyzed [in greater and greater detail] to the end, eventually disappear under analysis, and end up being composed of nothing. Nevertheless, appearances do appear to us. This of course is about reasoning and not about meditation; this is not an exercise for meditation."

Also, given that direct perceptions are nonconceptual by nature, even your invocation of “experience” is merely an inference, and thus it is in no better place than the inference of subject/object bifurcation, which is standard in Buddhist models of cognition, and in many ways, inferior to it.
It sure is an inference and does not intend to be other than that. Establishing first a unit of experience before the division into elements simply seems more practical to me to avoid the difficulties presented by taking subject and object as separate entities.

So experiences experience themselves, huh?

Astus said:
When an experience occurs, it is already as a conscious event. To say that the experience is a product of a contact between faculty, object, and consciousness, is an interpretation after the event. As there is no case where one experiences just one of the three constituents, their existence is an assumption based on ordinary/naive concepts of perception that is object oriented (operating with the idea of independent external entities) instead of experiential/phenomenological (taking appearances as they occur). So it is not the case that experiences experience themselves, as that already is an objectification and separation of what does not actually show those properties.

Malcolm wrote:
Conscious in what sense? Is it a conscious event inherently? Is it a conscious event in absence of contact? In absence of an object? In absence of a mind? How can one even speak of appearances at all in the absence of subject/object bifurcation? It is elementary to understand there are a subject, object, and contact, given, as you admit above, there can be no experience in absence of that triad. Further, in the case of a dream, it is clear there is an absence of this triad. Therefore, with respect to dreams you have to account for the experience of them based on some other theory of cognition. Also, given that direct perceptions are nonconceptual by nature, even your invocation of “experience” is merely an inference, and thus it is in no better place than the inference of subject/object bifurcation, which is standard in Buddhist models of cognition, and in many ways, inferior to it.

Theravadins generally have no interest in Mahayana bodhicitta, on the other hand, there nothing about starting in Theravada that prevents one from generating Mahayana bodhicitta if they are so inclined.
Anyone who can choose between Mahāyāna and Theravāda, and chooses the latter over the former, is choosing to follow the śrāvaka path. This is noncontroversial.

PadmaVonSamba said:
From the viewpoint of doctrine, this is true. But from the viewpoint of the practitioner, isn’t this really a difference of motivation and goal?
For me, in terms of actual practice, the different paths don’t have to exclude one another. Although I practice vajrayana, I don’t reject the Theravāda teachings. It’s good to study the Pali sutras (”suttas”). I have heard lamas bemoan the fact that the knowledge and practice of so many western students of vajrayana only includes the visualization practices and so on that they’ve learned at their local Tibetan Buddhism center, when there is so much more to Buddhist practice and study. So many people have never read Mahayana sutras or anything from the enormous wealth of the Pali teachings.

I find the terms, “superior” and “inferior” misleading, and perhaps this relates to the attitude of “cliquishness”.
It creates the idea that one path is better than the other.
I see it like this: you can certainly argue that a college education is superior to a primary school education. But that doesn’t mean the primary school education is bad, or wrong, or should be discarded. Without the primary school education, the college education is impossible.

Yes, it can be argued that one goes into deeper analytics than the other. But to assert that makes it superior is sort of like suggesting that being a surgeon is superior to being a general practitioner doctor. If the patient doesn’t require surgery, cutting them open won’t cure their illness.

I am a vajrayana practitioner for about 35 years. However, my family is moving soon, and our new house will be very close to a Theravāda temple, and very far from a Tibetan Buddhist center. I happen to know a couple of the Thai monks there very well, and look forward to spending time there, learning and studying, and meditating. My motivation is not any different. It is still to eventually attain full awakening for the benefit of all sentient beings.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, if you want people to understand what a "concept" is, you need a "thinker." Otherwise claiming that "Rather, it's just a concept.

Astus said:
Typically, mind (citta) is one thing, mental factors (caitta), another. They arise together, but they are not the same. The latter coordinate the experience of the six senses for the former.
And that can be a useful distinction to some extent. However, as there is no such thing as a stand alone mind, nor can there be unconscious experiences, it is for conventions sake to posit a mind with the sole function of awareness.

Malcolm wrote:
There is no such thing as a stand alone mind, this is true, but nevertheless thoughts (content) are not the mind (container), nor do thoughts exist outside a mind which thinks them, otherwise, this is just another conversation that winds up in the zero sum of negating the relative with the ultimate, and that is not the intention of the two truths and renders your rhetoric nihilistic.

If on the other hand, you acknowledge that there is a mind, conventionally, then you can acknowledge that is has experiences, etc., while at the same time including the fact that like all other phenomena, minds arise out of causes and conditions, along with their content. After all, matter is empty, emptiness is matter, etc. The ultimate does not negate relative, conventional phenomena, including mind, experiences, and everything else. The ultimate and the relative are inseparable.

There are ten unwholesome deeds defined in Tibetan buddhism as well. Four of them are about speech. One of them is called 'coarse speech'. Defined in sutra and lam rim.
So, in buddhist terms, how can violent speech be not an issue? Especially when it doesn't come from an enlightened being but an ordinary person.
And how should speech be not affecting? I don't understand. Viewed from my experiences, it makes no sense.

If language had no effect we don't need to use it at all.

Swearing is not necessarily violent. The term rtsub is much more like abusive speech. While swearing can be abusive, it mostly falls under the heading of idle speech.

Deities are just expressions of Abdhidharma concepts, in general. For example, the celestial mansion is understood to represent the thirty-seven bodhipakṣadharmas and so on. The purpose of deity yoga, the creation stage, is to counteract the ordinary concept of "I," "I am Malcolm," for example, with a transcendent concept of oneself, " I am Mañjuśṛī." And then you have a completion stage, to break attachment to even that sense of identity, in which nonconceptual samadhis are rapidly generated with a combination of prāṇāyāmas and postural yogas, etc.

The whole point of these is purify the obscurations related to afflictions and obscurations related to knowledge, respectively, that is the creation stage deity yoga is the remedy for affliction; the completion stage is the remedy for knowledge obscurations.

And yes, you need a guru, since you need empowerment, and yes, trying this on one's without guidance is always disastrous. One becomes a rudra.

I also agree there has always been cursing and cussing, but I think there was a definite up-tick in the use of swear-words with the Baby Boomers, especially in the 60s and 70s. Before us, I think so-called gentlemen and gentlewomen (what a concept!) did not swear so openly and constantly. Definitely men tended not to swear in front of women and most "respectable" women simply didn't swear. I just have to think of my grandmothers, aunts, and my mother to know that swearing was not acceptable behavior. I clearly remember getting in serious trouble when my friend and I (12 years old, 1958) were overheard using the word "screw" on the front porch when we thought no one was around. Yeah, definitely, I do think our speech and behavior have coarsened and I do think that is having its karmic repercussions.

Malcolm wrote:
This just reflects your upper middle class background. Working class people have always cussed and sworn. These mores came to the fore only when the new middle class Americans began to ape Victorian mores. Before that, there was a lot of cussing and swearing.

Also, I just want to point out that the large majority of our more offensive swear words are normal Anglo-Saxon words that were in regular use in common language prior the Norman invasion, and only became deprecated due to systematic oppression of Anglo-Saxon language by the Normans. So, also, we can understand swearing as a social revolt against our "betters."

Honestly, IMO if people want to smuggle God into their Buddhadharma, they won't stop because they lack a term to appropriate. I'm for "Root Buddha" rather than "First" or "Original Buddha" anyways, because rather than being the first in a chronological series, it is more like an underlying root making a stem possible.

And if moderators want to split threads, that's up to them. They certainly don't need participants' permission.

This is what I understand the Shravakayana and subsequent Mahayana doctrines reject as unaware and incorrect assumptions.

“Personality” is the current configuration of karmas that format fundamental energies, a confinement of those energies. It is not the essence of a being. Liberation is a release from than confinement and subsequent spontaneous expression of those energies as Buddha Activity.

Wayfarer said:
The term 'soul' is not the equivalent of the Vedantic term 'ātman' which was rejected by the Buddha. The view of those who believe in the idea of a ‘permanent self’ is frequently expressed in terms such as this example from the Brahmajāla Sutta:

The self and the world are eternal, barren, steadfast as a mountain peak, set firmly as a post. And though these beings rush around, circulate, pass away and re-arise, but this remains eternally. (DN1.1.32)

The Alagaddūpama Sutta likewise criticizes those who think:

‘This is the self, this is the world; after death I shall be permanent, everlasting, not subject to change; I shall endure as long as eternity’ - this too he [i.e. ‘the eternalist’] regards thus: ‘This is mine, this I am, this is my self’

Here, ‘this’ is that which ‘the eternalist’ believes is something durable, within which ‘beings rush around, circulate and re-arise’. This arises from the Vedic teaching of sat as ‘what really exists’ -  something which is to be distinguished from asat, that which is illusory or unreal. Hence in this formulation, sat is what is ‘eternal, unchangeable, set firmly as a post’, and distinguishable from samsara or maya. Sat is conceived as ‘the essence of things’, both in general terms as Brahman and particular beings as ātman.

The Buddha neither denies nor affirms that there is a self (See https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn44/sn44.010.than.html ) but says that 'everything arises as a result of dependent origination'. So the conception of an eternally-existent self which is apart from dependent origination is what is rejected. The Buddha's teaching is much more subtle than that.

However, I agree that the frequent expression 'the Buddha teaches there is no soul' is not quite correct either, insofar as this can be interpreted as materialism, i.e. that beings are simply subject to physical laws and there are no further consequences of karma beyond this temporal existence.  That is the usual meaning of 'having no soul'.

But neither does the Buddha teach there is a soul. Really the word 'soul' is a term from Western cultural discourse and doesn't have an exact equivalent in the Buddhist lexicon, so it's mapped against ātman and then criticized on those grounds, but that is not quite correct.

If i understand correctly, alaya is not a thing it is a term that denotes a collection of functions of ignorance. the ignorance ceases to operate in the  Dzogchen level of the ultimate result and only the four kayas remain. This can be the result of either trekcho or thogal.

Malcolm wrote:
The all-basis, ( kun gzhi, ālaya ), is just ignorance; it is the Dzogchen term for what in other systems is called "the knowledge obscuration."  This is why in the text called Stainless Space in the Lama Yang Tig, the mind, aka all-basis, is called "an obscuration to be abandoned."

It is distinct from the basis ( gzhi, sthāna ), which is never contaminated by ignorance.

So, bottom line now is that there are 51 Senators who, for legal or electoral or other reasons, agree that Trump gets a walk? He gets a wrist slap and an asterisk in the history books for being impeached, and back to business as usual?

When Trump was elected, many of my friends were panicked. I tried to reassure them, "As long as we maintain rule of law, we're fine." Apparently I was too optimistic.

ETA Why does a simple majority suffice for a matter of this import?

No, definitely not.

The all-basis consciousness is a product of ma rig pa, ignorance, the opposite of rig pa, knowledge.

In yogacāra, after the seeds of the all-basis consciousness is exhausted, it vanishes, along with the afflicted consciousness. It itself transforms into gnosis.

This process is not accepted in Dzogchen. Gnosis, or pristine consciousness, is present as the basis, and the basis is has the nature of the three kāyas. In Dzogchen, the three kāyas are not newly produced, but are always present in the form of potential.

People need to grok - a lot of the wealth we are talking about is not accumulated through 'good, honest work' but rather rigging the rules so that money funnels into certain pockets no matter what the person those pockets are attached to does. What I'm about, and I believe Malcolm would concur, is altering the rules so that money doesn't just funnel into a few pockets, but rather flows more freely through the entire social community. In a sense, all I'm advocating for is to fix the rules so that the trickle down actually trickles down.

Malcolm wrote:
The only way to ensure this is through taxation of the super wealthy. After all, when we built all these beautiful roads and bridges, the marginal tax rate was more than 70% of income over 1 million (in 1935). Everyone needs to pay taxes, the rich must pay more. The argument you sometimes see that well, 50% of the country pays no income taxes to the feds ignores the high taxes levied against poor people in the form of sales taxes, fuel taxes, etc., which impact poor people enormously, but do not impact the wealthy at all. Then there is corporate malfeasance.

When the ultra wealthy are not generous, through tax evasion, corporate subsidies, parking money in passive investments which take money out the economy, engineering tax cuts for themselves, etc., all of this is stinginess by definition. It may result in birth in lower realms, or a poor human being, but the fact is that there are far more poor people than wealthy people, and if wealthy people do not do their part, like they did from 1935-1980, by paying higher marginal tax rates, and so on, as they say on the street, "shit is going to get real."

Common Mahāyāna is a Vajrayāna term. Vajrayāna refers to itself as uncommon Mahāyāna. From this perspective, yes, also the Lotus is included in common Mahāyāna for any number of reasons, the most significant of which is that whereas empowerment (abhiṣeka) from all the tathāgatas is the culmination of the path of common Mahāyāna in the last half of the tenth bhumi, it is the entryway into the path of Secret Mantra. Naturally, this idea is foreign to Tientai philosophy, which arose prior to the advent of Vajrayāna as a major movement in India, Central and SE Asia. Zhiyi (538-597) passed away just as Secret Mantra was emerging in India. Thus, its scriptures, practices and so on are completely excluded from Zhiyi's hermeneutical schema. His interpretive scheme simply can't be applied to the Mantrayāna Tradition.

As for the 42 or 52 stages, this is from Avatamsaka Sutra and another sutra I can't remember the name of offhand, respectively.

Malcolm wrote:
The 52 stages are strictly Chinese Buddhist interpretation of the Avatamsaka Sūtra, which has five chapters describing the qualities of the ten bhumis; but in China, it was interpreted that these chapters (such as the ten dedications, etc.) were themselves distinct stages and levels of practice. This concept is complete absent in Indian Mahāyāna.

Thanks to Obama. The growth of the economy has actually slowed under Trump.

They are largely the same as they were before, with only cosmetic changes.



Dan74 said:
the tougher stance on the illegal migrants isn't about racism but that the jobs actually go to the Americans

Malcolm wrote:
Total nonsense. People from Mexico and Central America have never "taken jobs away from Americans" by migrating here. Instead, NAFTA created a more or less stable economy in Mexico (now coming apart at the seams because of Orbador), and American companies sought the cheaper labor on Mexico. So we exported jobs. But Mexicans etc., never took jobs away from Americans in this country.

NATO countries are finally beginning to foot their bill in defence.

No, they aren't. As of March, 2019, only the US, UK, and Greece(!) met their targets, joined by Poland, Latvia and Lithuania.

Not to forget the compassionate First Step bill about prisons signed into law by the Donald. Oh, and no, he hasn't started WWIII contrary to all the progressive hysteria.

Ummm...no, that was supposed to be the reason we weren't supposed to vote for Hillary.

Dan74 said:
And you will surely have a handy rebuttal to every one of these points and disregard the fact that the conservatives had the same for when people were supporting Obama. Is it equivalent? Can one be judged to be objectively better than the other?

Malcolm wrote:
Every net benefit we are experiencing today began in Obama's administration. Trump just does what he usually does, that is, claim other people's accomplishments as his own.

Every net deficit we will be experiencing in the years ahead will be a result of Trump's gutting every regulation he can find. The sad thing is that the gutting of clean air regs and clean water regs in the US have the actual effect of making your children's world a more unsafe and more unhealthy place to live, since other countries will follow suit. Conservatives have to get their heads out of their asses and understand what is actually valuable to conserve (environment, animal life, human life) and stop catering wholesale to destructive, extractive capitalism.

Maybe

There are all kinds of stupid people in the world, including this logic you saw in some progressives in 2016, "If Trump gets elected, he will screw everything up so much, people will have to vote him out."

Not sure that is going to happen.

However here the discussion is about individuals who have the two confidences in place already. Kongtrul's advice is that they should study the tantras and their commentaries to gain a proper understanding of the contents and then seek to receive authentic initiation.

You should go ask a Khenpo before you continue to spread this advice.

After a few exchanges you always revert to personal and instead of sticking to debating the arguments you always feel the need to undermine your opponent by questioning their capacity and understanding.

We would not be having this debate if you had not cited Kongtrul to support your understanding.

As you constructed your argument instead of questioning my capacity to understand you should have directed your poison at Elio.

Malcolm wrote:
Translators, myself included, make difficult choices at times, intending only the best for their readers. This is the reason why I check the Tibetan, etc., to see if perhaps an unintended meaning accompanies an English word, with connotations that are not implied by the Tibetan word. People who do not know Tibetan do this all the time with English translations of Buddhist classics, causing themselves and others no amount of confusion.

In Tibetan, mnyan pa does not carry the implication of going to Amazon and ordering the Tsongkhapa's commentary on Cakrasamvara to study it prior to having received the Cakrasamvara empowerment. It means go and hear something about tantra from a qualified person so one can have confidence in tantra.

florin said:
I will stick to the way Elio translated these texts and i am happy with that. After all they have become classics and droves of practitioners have been helped by them.

Malcolm wrote:
No doubt many people have been helped by these translations, but that does not mean one accepts every single English word in them at face value.

Why don't you go ask a Kagyu Khenpo who is expert in this text whether he thinks it means that an unripened person should just go and study any tantric commentary they like without first having received the empowerment, and see what kind of answer you get.
