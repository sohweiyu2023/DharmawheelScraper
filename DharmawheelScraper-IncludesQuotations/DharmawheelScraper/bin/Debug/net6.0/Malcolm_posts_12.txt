What i am saying is that the essence of empowerment is not necessarily dependent upon a specific form.

Malcolm wrote:
The essence of an empowerment is the arrangement of a special dependent origination by the master upon the disciple according to the methods taught by Buddha Vajradhara in the authoritative tantras, realized by mahāsiddhas, practiced by bodhisattvas, and translated by qualified translators out of Sanskrit and other dialects of India in Tibetan, and thence into English and other languages. There is no other essence than this.

These days however, people take it upon them themselves to just make up whatever doctrine feels good to them, disregarding the clear words of the sūtras and tantras about how to follow a virtuous mentor or a guru. They buy books and attempt to practice their contents without transmission. Such people close the doorway to liberation for themselves by inappropriately using methods taught in the tantras.

« Empowerment » is a ritual.

Malcolm wrote:
Not just a ritual. It is misunderstandings like this that cause harm to the teachings.

There is no guru in Vajrayāna without empowerment, and there is no authorization to explain the details of Vajrayāna practice at all to someone who has not received empowerment. The Mahāmudrātilaka make this abundantly clear:

First, once empowerments are conferred
upon the disciple,
at that time the great secret may be explained
because they have become suitable recipients.

If there is no empowerment, there will be no siddhi,
just as there is no oil from pressing sand. 

When someone arrogantly explicates
the collection of tantras to one lacking empowerment,
both master and disciple will go to hell
as soon as they die, even if they attained siddhi.

It is pretty common to encounter Vajrayana practitioners who are very confused about this subject.
How could one receive empowerment, instructions, and teachings (thus entering into the vehicle) and be confused about who their root guru is?

Malcolm wrote:
People are often confused about this point, and think that only one guru can be a root guru or mūlaguru. In reality, any qualified person from whom one has received the four empowerments in a proper way is one's root guru.

In Nyingma and Kagyu circles is common to understand that one's principle guru is the person from whom one has received definitive instructions through which one has understood the nature of the mind. The Sakyapas and others talk about one's karmically linked root guru as being one's principle guru, which has the same meaning as the Nyingma/Kagyu idea.

Some people think that their root guru is the person from whom they received refuge, this is another common misunderstanding. Some people in organizations like Shambhala, are encouraged to think dead teachers like Trungpa are their root guru, thus adding more confusion to the pot. Some people think they can just pick a famous figure, like HHDL, the Karmapa, etc., to be their root guru without having ever received teachings from them, but this is yet another misunderstanding.

All of this confusion comes about from not studying proper commentaries like the 50 Verses on guru devotion, and other texts.

Budhas know things directly without sense mediation.  Therefore, we too can know things directly without sense mediation because without that ability, we can never become Buddhas.  It follows that direct knowing makes sense only if it is not mediated by sense consciousness, unless we have one definition of direct knowing for Buddhas and another for the rest.

Malcolm wrote:
So, are you talking about yogapratyakṣa? If so, what inhibits this is traces of ignorance, which is why the yogic direct perception of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas is incapable ot realizing all objects of knowledge due to the presence of traces of ignorance.

Generally, however, pratyakṣa is confined to the five sense because manas is always a cognition of a direct perception of the five sense bases, aka a simple impression.

Yogic direct perception is a personal intuition (pratyatmyavit), not an ordinary direct perception, for example the direct perception of a hawk hunting mice.

People complain mostly about eating things that have faces. There are massive environmental benefits in oyster farming, and they provide a pain-free source of animal protein. Oysters have no central nervous system and no sense organs, so they do not feel pain; and like plants, they respond to temperature and other environmental factors for feeding, breeding, etc. They may technically belong to the animal kingdom, but they are not sentient in any meaningful way. If it is argued they have sexual reproduction, so do plants.

Sakya Pandit complained in the 13th century about this view in Illuminating the Muni's Intent:

Here someone claims, “If one obtains a medical diagnosis, recites texts and so on, one will have no confidence in the jewel of the Dharma. Having obtained a medical diagnosis, it is best to then go for refuge to the Three Jewels. One will damage one’s refuge in the Three Jewels if one takes medicine.” 

In that case, it is said in the Bhaisayavastu of the Vinayāgama that doctors and medicines are to be relied upon by sick bhikṣus. Since food and drink are included together in the four kinds of medicine, if one eats or drinks one will be damaging one’s refuge. Therefore, just as one eats and drinks, how can it be reasonable to claim “One harms one’s going for refuge if one takes medicine?” If a scholar sees this, he will be disgusted.

The point of manifestation in Buddhism, however, is different than an avatāra in purāṇic texts. A manifestation leads beings to awakening in whatever form suits their inclinations, regardless of whether they realise it or not. Avatāras are more about restoring cosmic order or punishing evil. So, it makes no sense for an avatāra to manifest in infinite forms to suit beings' needs in the way a buddha or bodhisattva does.

Malcolm wrote:
I wasn't referring to the distinction between an avatāra and a nirmāṇa. Both are docetic in nature. I was referring the obvious adherence by Buddhists to standard forms of Indian mythopeia, the use of common tropes, which indeed can include avatāric themes, such as Rudra Cakravartin's aka Kalki, defeat of the mlecchas in the final battle to restore world peace from mleccha domination, after the latter attack Shambhala; or the taming of Mahādeva by Śrī Heruka in the Cakrasaṃvara literature or the taming of Rudra found in the lower tantras, etc., in which these beings initiated an age of chaos and inequity, requiring Vajradhara to step in and intervene, etc.

So, still Team Indra.

Its true that the Bonpos work in some Iranian themes into their quasi-Buddhist mythopeia, and that the Chinese and Japanese work in native cultural themes into their mythopeia, and there is indeed some reason to think that the Iranian "paradise", that is the walled garden, may have some influence on the conception and depiction of Sukhavati. Nevertheless, Indian mythopeia is so strong a current wherever Buddhism spread from India that it completely dominates the local myths, which only survive through being appropriated, like domestic animals.

Thanks, Malcolm.  I hope you'll please post more about this, and your certainty about bodhi happening once, please.  I think you mean only once.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, just once.



desert_woodworker said:
I didn't bring in bodhi, but spoke (and do speak) of true wisdom (prajna), which I note arises spontaneously and in seamless accord with conditions and events just as they arise or occur, and our response is immediate and unmediated, simultaneously with the operation of true compassion (karuna) in our action or response.  This is in everyday life, when one is awake.

Malcolm wrote:
Awake = bodhana. This means truly realized. An ārya, not a common person.

desert_woodworker said:
Now, awakenings occur, and one has this opening of/to spontaneous true wisdom and true compassion, on a daily and continuing basis, for some time.  When one is not blessed with these -- say, when the awakened state is no longer supported by the eight elements that one has developed within the eightfold-path -- and hence the awakened state has submerged again, eroded, evaporated -- one is then an ordinary deluded being, again (even if with a memory of "the way things 'really' are", as obvious in the awakened state).

Malcolm wrote:
While on the impure bodhisattva stages, which begin with the path of seeing, one can forget one's awakening upon taking rebirth. In this lifetime, however, it is impossible for awakening to erode once attained. In other words, there is no way to fall back from the path of seeing in this lifetime. However, on the path of application, one's similitude of awakening can certainly come and go.

desert_woodworker said:
I'd appreciate knowing how you will expand on the notion and understanding of bodhi, as distinct (if distinct... ) from prajna which arises naturally and unbidden in the awakened state.

Malcolm wrote:
Prajñā is the cause of awakening (bodhi), on this we both agree. However, there are two kinds of prajñā: contaminated and uncontaminated, and all prajñā of ordinary people, no matter how subtle, is contaminated.

desert_woodworker said:
I'm not sure this is the thread in which to do it. I'm new at the board, and perhaps you feel it would be better to begin a new and dedicated thread along the lines you envision which could address these things.  Thank you!, very much.

Malcolm wrote:
This kind of discussion between practitioners of Chan and practitioners of Vajrayāna are not that fruitful. The principle reason is that Vajrayāna practitioners, following Indian Mahāyāna precedents, make very clear distinctions between the paths below and above the path of seeing, and categorize experiences accordingly. So to us, the idea that one's awakening can be eroded does not make any sense. If it can be eroded, it is not awakening, but rather a peak on the path of application, which itself has four stages: heat, peak, patience, highest mundane phenomena. The last, highest mundane phenomena, is where one rests prior to making the final breakthrough on the path of seeing. Once one has obtained the path of seeing, it is impossible that one's awakening can be eroded at all in this life, and in future lives, if and when one meets the path again, one will swiftly recapture this awakening, though it might be thousands of years hence. Nevertheless, such people who have woken up once in past lives will be characterized by uncommon compassion and selflessness in deed, their minds "perfumed" by the realization of emptiness. But they will not realize emptiness again until they meet the Mahāyāna Dharma again.

The minty flavors makes it feel rather fresh compared to other nicotine administration strategies. It is also way better than patches. I feel that snus is what nicotine patches and gums were meant to be.

Can the direct knowing by Sem Nyi which precedes the experience of mental consciousness be faulty if the physical or mental sense consciousness is faulty?

conebeckham said:
Sem Nyi, Mind Itself, is the nature of consciousness--saying it "precedes" in a temporal fashion is incorrect--I pointed this out in a subsequent post.  Whether the physical or mental sense consciousnesses are faulty or not is not relevant--whether the consciousness is faulty or not, the nature of the consciousness is primordially beyond fault.  As I said, it's not really correct to say that Awareness "precedes."  Let's just say that it imbues all our experience--"Unborn" is just a descriptive word.

You asked: The Buddha said, when this arises, that arises; when this ceases, that ceases.
When the mind is free from inner and outer objects, what object still remains in order for that mind not to cease as per dependent origination?
If the mind is free from inner and outer objects, is there still a "mind?"

Sherab said:
Since the first instance of an experience is mediated by a sense consciousness, and since a sense consciousness can be faulty, how can the experience of the Mind Itself be free from error?  It does not matter if the experience by the Mind Itself is atemporal, it's experience is still mediated by a faulty sense consciousness according to you.

I should also say that "precedes" is not quite the right word, as the naturally present awareness cannot be "temporal" and in fact imbues experiences as well.  It is beyond the ability of conceptual mind to contain or define.  But it is not a "thing," or any sort of permanent entity either.

Malcolm wrote:
This is just consciousness. Otherwise, you are proposing a consciousness which does not belong to the six or eight consciousnesses and this is erroneous.

Consciousness is not necessarily dualistic. When you subtract "vi" from "jñāna" you only have jñāna as a remainder. But this still is not outside the manodhātu.

Thank you Malcolm and by the way I have appreciated your comments on another post regarding 'The myth of progress'. I am at a friend's house who happened to have a copy so I just found information on page 251 regarding King Mune Tsenpo's three attempts to equalise the rich and poor.

I was interested as there was a very brief mention of this event on page 94 in the book 'Wisdom in Exile' by Lama Jampa Thaye.  To put it in some context starting on page 93 "In conclusion, we must be aware the possibility that, out of insufficient understanding of compassion in the teachings of the Buddha, one will hurry to ally Buddhism with whatever ideologies intone the term 'compassion' more seductively. Such systems usually promise that a state of general perfection can be attained just by external changes, but, as we have already discussed, such a view is not Buddhist - apart from anything else, it is a denial of karma, the law of cause and effect. The story of the failure of King Mune Tsenpo's well intentioned but unwise policy of redistribution of wealth in eighth-century Tibet is somewhat instructive in this regard."

I wondered if some people would read this and conclude that, for instance, taxing people to set up a social security system or National Health Service was somehow not in accord with Dharma.

Malcolm wrote:

In the collections for enlightenment chapter in the same text there are recommendations to the king to set up shelters (housing), etc. Indeed, he touches on the necessity of rulers to provide for the nation, etc., in order to generate positive merit.

So, frankly, whether the Catholic mass is chanted in Latin, facing the alter, or chanted in the local language facing the congregation, should not matter one iota to a dharma practitioner.

Each lineage within a school has their own core scriptures (i.e. Dudjom sung bum as the collection of texts that make up the Dudjom Tersar).

Have you seen a list somewhere of what each school has as their core Scriptures and what the lineages of teach school uses as their main texts?

Malcolm wrote:
The basic list is pretty simple:

The basic tantra for Sakya and Kagyu is Hevajra. The basic tantra for Geluk is Guhyasamāja. The basic tantra for Nyingma, as you have identified, is Guhyagarbha. The basic tantra for Jonang is Kālacakra.

The monastic curriculum for study is pretty much the same for all schools: Nagārjuna, Candra, Śantideva; the five treatises of Maitreya (in varying degrees); Abhidharma of Vasubandhu and Asanga; the Abhisamayālaṃkara commentaries of Vimuktisena and Haribhadra; Dignaga and Dharmakīrti's epistemology, and the Vinayasūtra of Gunbhadra and commentaries.

In terms of practice cycles: for Sakya it is Hevajra and Naropa's Khecari. For Geluk, Guhyasamāja, Cakrasamvara and Vajrabhairava. For Kagyu, Cakrasamvara and Vajrayogini of various traditions from specific subschool to the next; for Nyingma, too many different practice traditions to mention.  Jonang, Kālacakra and the six limb yoga.

Then of course there are many hundreds of practices which wind through all schools. So, it is pretty hard to quantify.

If SF of any kind is not your thing, you could try A Banquet of Consequences Reloaded by Satyajit Das. He's a mainstream financial writer and it's a bit dry and technical in places but his analysis is rather similar. In brief, the neoliberal model has failed everyone except the super-rich and the consequences are upon us. Roughly speaking, voodoo finance + rising inequality + demographics (ageing population, shrinking workforce) + climate change + the loss of trust in institutions = collapse of the existing system, within years rather than decades.
To go back to an earlier writer, in 2009 Joe Romm asked "Is the global economy a Ponzi scheme?" - https://thinkprogress.org/is-the-global-economy-a-ponzi-scheme-2c06fbd46c3/ - and answered his own question thus: This global Ponzi scheme is not just a metaphor ... but for me a central organizing narrative of how to think about the fix we have put ourselves in." He was speaking primarily about the climate crisis but the metaphor works equally well for the field which spawned it.

While searching for Bodhisattva Gaia, I only found references to his work and Plum Village.

Was this him incorporating Western ecological theological concepts into Buddhism where it didn’t belong? Is there an equivalent to Gaia in Zen Buddhism that I didn’t see before?

Josef said:
This is because their actual practice is incredibly fragile. So fragile is their faith that they have to just though hoops to excuse the abuses of people they have never even met in order to feel secure in their identity as Buddhists.


Malcolm wrote:
Its kind of like white fragility amongst white conservatives—constantly accusing liberals of brittleness, when in reality it is they who are brittle, when their cherished icons are found wanting.

I also find it of interest that the most arch conservative voices in all of this come from establishment Nyingmapas, who, of course, are the least conservative when it actually comes to innovations. One detects a little insecurity there? I imagine they must freak out when they hear that Chogyal Namkhai Norbu dismissed the notion that every word attributed to Guru Rinpoche in the Rinchen Terdzo, for example, could actually have been set down or spoken by Guru Rinpoche. He didn't give a percentage...he just said that it was impossible that it all could possibly come from Padmasambhava.

This is why harping on "This one and that one is a terton" really makes no sense. Of course, if a terma does not contradict the teachings of the Buddha, there is no reason to immediately condemn it and say, "This is a false Dharma," as long as it is correct in its essentials; the same goes with dream teachings, pure visions, and the like, which are found in ALL schools. I also practice termas, so I am not criticizing termas per se (most of the Sakya and Nyingma sadhanas in my cyclical practice regimen were composed by Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo). But I am critiquing the constant refrain heard here that the conduct of tertons is absolutely beyond all judgement. This is just gaslighting.

The period of garrisoning Roman troops in conquered lands really didn’t begin until the end of the Republic, and the rise of the Imperium, but even here, Romans were generally more like raiders than conquerors. They really didn’t have a program to spread their culture to other nations, unlike ideologically motivated theists such as Christians and Muslims.

I don't think Mukpo's actions were genetic. I think they were a product of the groupthink that exists in Shambhala. If you set up a belief system where you refuse to apply societal norms to the leader, it's almost inevitable he will not apply them himself. I am by no means excusing Mukpo but I doubt many people would act differently when surrounded by that type of unthinking adulation and apparent lack of consequences.

PeterC said:
Mukpo Jr was heavily abused as a child, then put into a position where he was adulated and told he has complete power over his followers, people who considered Mukpo Sr’s conduct as the “authentic” dharma.  The results should not be surprising to anyone.

If you do the right retreats and learn the right rituals you are qualified to give empowerments. If you spend enough time studying you are capable of explaining the Dharma.  But you could still be completely unqualified as a guru because you lack the qualities.  And you could also be a terrible human being because of the psychological damage you’ve sustained, in the case of Mukpo Jr.

This is why, contrary to the assertions of our friend Sonam, you cannot just take the endorsement of other lamas, however famous they are, at face value, because they give these endorsements far too freely and rarely go back on them when things go wrong.  You have to do your own due diligence.

Western Buddhism could use a bit of that right now. That's why I brought up Lha Lama Yeshe Ö.

You seem to really get off on relating stories about teachers and their unconventional conduct.

I prefer stories about truly great beings like Sapan, Longchenpa, Ngorchen, Tsongkhapa, etc.

The stories of the Indian Mahāsiddhas often cannot be taken literally. That's why, for example, in the Caryagiti, the inner meaning of many of their dohas is exposed.

Moreover, as I pointed out, both Virupa and Saraha poke fun at those who do not really understand the meaning of mahāmudra, etc., making fun of people who ape vratacaryā without understanding its purpose, which is to test one's own stability. And here, there are clear signs of when one is ready to begin that conduct. In the case of Tilopa and Naropa, Tilopa was testing Naropa's stability, since Naropa had been practicing Vajrayāna for years already. But frankly, to bring up Sogyal and Trungpa, their students had no stable equipoise to test, actually. Thus, presenting their actions as "unconventional behavior" in order to benefit their students, who I will remind you were by every measure beginners in the Dharma, is a false pretense, and a dangerous one.

Frankly, I think that Tibetans as a whole have taken away, in many instances, the wrong message from their reception of the Mahāsiddha tradition. Not only that, but the fragmented way the Mahāsiddha tradition has been received by Western Buddhists has caused many of us to become deviants and enablers of deviants, excusing deviant behavior and lauding frauds as awakened beings because we really can't know who is and who isn't realized. That means depending on anyone's authority other than our own eyes and ears is a huge error. We can only observe whether someone's behavior and teachings correspond with the Dharma as it is taught in the sūtras or tantras or not.

I refer frequently to Sapan's Three Vows because he gives clear instruction about how to evaluate anything that presents itself as Dharma. Of course, you won't read it, because it will offend you, since he questions everything that Tibetans do, apart from what is actually found in the sūtras and tantras and that which agrees with what is found in the sūtras and tantras.

You can claim until the cows come home that this master and that master is realized, but you don't know this from your own realization and clairvoyance. This is the main reason your missives, Sonam, and others like them, are such pious farces.

We don't need outrageous "teachers." We need teachers who can guide people and train them to the level where their vajras and bells levitate in space and beyond. And we are not even talking about the Vajrayāna path of seeing here.

Now of course, I assume that my principle gurus are realized beings. I am also sufficiently aware of my own limitations to understand that this is strictly for my own benefit, this is my concept. It is not an objective fact. This is why on the one hand I feel free to share my unfavorable opinion of Trungpa, Sogyal, etc., and on the other hand, encourage their students to maintain pure perception of them despite whatever opinion I may have, because as Peter pointed out, the former was a qualified vajrācarya, and as you pointed out, the latter did have a sound understanding of Dzogchen according to Nyoshul Khenpo, at least intellectually—and Dzogchen, like dependent origination, is not easy to understand.

You on the other hand insist that the realization of this person and that person you mention is an objective fact, and that therefore, whatever they do is the action of a bodhisattva on the stages. That is, I am sorry to say, is completely deluded. It is not even conventionally deluded, it is fully deluded. You cannot possibly know this. You can only believe this. It maybe a useful belief for you. However, insisting that your subjective beliefs are objective facts is sad, and possibly harmful to others.

Why is sexual misconduct one of the 8 precepts?

Malcolm wrote:
You don’t seem to understand the parameters of sexual misconduct.

There are four categories of sexual misconduct when defined from the point of view of the individual: upasaka, upavasa, shramanera, and bhikshu. Eight, when multiplied by gender.

For the latter three, sexual misconduct is any sexual conduct, including masturbation, for the duration the vow is maintained. In the case of the upavasa, the fast day vow,  only 24 hours.

Otherwise, for the upasaka, sexual misconduct is defined in terms of partner, place, time, and orifice. A wrong partner is another’s spouse, partner, or fiancé, a minor, someone under guardianship, or a close relative. Wrong place means in public, a shrine or temple. Wrong Time means daytime. Wrong Orifice means oral or anal. That’s it, this is all described in chapter four of the Abhidharmakoshabhasyam of Vasubandhu, which is definitive on this subject for Sarvastivadin upasakas like myself.

One is not required to observe the vow of refraining from intoxication and sexual misconduct (the latter depends on the former for upasakas) if one decides one does not wish to hold all five vows. One can be a three vow holder, observing only the restraints from killing, stealing, and lying.

Of course, in Vajrayana, it goes without saying that desire is employed in the path,

As Zhen Li points out, the Tibetan tradition only recognizes Indian source texts of verifiable provenance for such issues.

tobes said:
The best illustration of the power and impact of America’s original philosophical radicalism may be discovered in the first sentence of the nation’s first founding document. Many historians today take for granted that the reference in the preamble of the Declaration of Independence to “the laws of Nature and of Nature’s God” amounts to a gesture of conventional piety—and no doubt it was written partly in order to be read in this way. Religious conservatives today routinely celebrate it as proof that America was founded as a Christian nation. These and similar interpretations serve mainly to express some deep and persistent assumptions about the nature of human experience: that we govern ourselves through acts of faith; that all authority must rest on the assertion of belief in some higher authority; and that all would be well if we could return to the simple faith of our fathers.

Yet “Nature’s God” properly belongs to the radical philosophical religion of deism. It refers to nothing that we commonly mean by the term “God,” but rather to something closer to “Nature.” It tells us that we are and always have been the source of our own authority; that we govern ourselves not through acts of faith but through acts of understanding; and that if we should find ourselves beholden to some other imagined authority, this can only mean that we have constructed the conditions of our own servitude. The Declaration of Independence—precisely where it superficially seems to invoke the blessing of the established religion—really stands for an emancipation of the political order from God.

I couldn’t necessarily vouch for the following website overall, but there is some citation within the following quote:

https://www.healthaid.co.uk/healthaid-blog/Could-It-Be-Zinc-Deficiency

“Frequent sex and masturbation can be one of the key causes of zinc deficiency. David Horrobin, M.D. and Ph.D. from Oxford University, declared that, “The amount of zinc in semen is such that one ejaculation may get rid of all the zinc that can be absorbed from the intestines in one day. This has a number of consequences. Unless the amount lost is replaced by an increased dietary intake, repeated ejaculation may lead to a real zinc deficiency with various problems developing, including impotence… It is even possible, given the importance of zinc for the brain, that 19th century moralists were correct when they said that repeated masturbation could make one mad!” Also Carl C. Pfeiffer, Ph.D., M.D., in his book on zinc stated: “In a zinc-deficient adolescent, sexual excitement and excessive masturbation might precipitate insanity.””
https://www.menshealth.com/sex-women/a19543996/sex-diet-foods-and-menu/

...low zinc stores have been blamed for decreases in semen volume and testosterone levels, explains Sara Brewer, M.D., author of Better Sex. "Each ejaculation can expend up to 5 milligrams of zinc, or one-third of your daily allowance,"

If one gets enough zinc and selenium (and also eat animal products in general, as has been mentioned before), then maybe it’s not an huge concern.

But there’s also the problem of addiction and dopamine issues  with wanking too. Like I said in my earlier post, it’s not something that is always easy to “do just everyone once in awhile”.

Therefore why not practice Yoga and/or get into a healthy sexual relationship instead (in the latter case, even if there is occasional ejaculation happening; there at least is not the same level of addiction and dopamine issues going on as with masturbation).

It is unambiguous that Buddhism denies any form of a prime mover, first cause, or ex nihilo creation by a supreme being. Thus alone caused theists in every tradition that have encountered Buddhism to see it as atheist, nastika.

As far as the political ramifications of theism go, it is irrefutable that every distinctly monotheist tradition has been imperialistic and oppressive by nature. Not all theistic traditions are necessarily monotheistic. However, since theistic traditions just reflect human absolute monarchies, even the tolerant theistic religions are anti-democratic  and despotic by nature.

Malcolm wrote:
Oh, that depends on the narrative you want to follow, really. If it pleases you to think the Buddha achieved Buddhahood a gazillion eons ago, that's fine, and I agree, being a Mahāyāni, but the whole point of the Jatakas and everything up to his demonstration of the twelve deeds was to demonstrate how a bodhisattva practiced the path, soup to nuts, and one cannot take birth as an animal if one has reached the patience of the path of seeing. So, even if he was "emanating" as the Hare King, it was to indicate how bodhisattvas below the path of seeing are to conduct themselves.

The bodhisattva path is arduous, deliberately so. It involves helping sentient beings right from the beginning through the six perfections.

One of the things you seem to forget is that bodhisattvas on the impure stages forget their realization during death, rebirth, and conception, and have to take rebirth again and again as ordinary bodhisattvas until they meet the path again. So what, are you claiming that you should only help sentient beings when you have reattained the path of seeing, that could be thousands of years from now.

And I not talking about attending political rallies. I am talking about being a nurse, doctor, etc., all the right livelihoods that we ought to follow as Buddhist practitioners. I am not talking about being a political activist. I am talking about being an ordinary human being motivated by bodhicitta.

BTW, Trungpa's teacher, Khenpo Gangshar, went around rousting people out of retreat telling them to get off their asses and go help people, whether they were realized or not. He is Trangu Rinpoches teacher. He was also reckoned to be a great dzogchen lineage master. So you see, not all Lineage Masters have the exact same idea.

That's too weak of a correlation in my mind. The correlation in my experience is very tight. Of course, I say "seems" because who knows what's actually happening. Of course, the dharma is not responsible for the accumulation of karmic potential to begin with.

In Theravada Abhidhamma-based teaching it is fairly explicitly taught that meditation will lead to some deep, disturbing things to arise if one practices seriously and intensely. As the mind settles, karmic seeds ripen in an environment where there is no clinging/grasping. Some of this can get very intense--- one descriptor is the terror of a mother watching her last son being executed. The idea is that one prepares oneself for this via meditation. I've heard similar teachings across the Mahayana.

I think the emphasis on only positives is misleading, and often catches students off guard. Very few teachers IME recognize this and adequately prepare students for this.

Malcolm wrote:
There is also the fact that in kriya tantra people practice by addressing the deity as external, like Tāra, for example, for common siddhis; a kind of practice that is enjoyed by brahmins, which also depends heavily on ritual purity and so on. So, because Vajrayāna is a path of skillful means, it employs people's theistic tendencies. But this vanishes in carya tantra, where the deity is understood as a symbol of the nature of the mind and one visualizes oneself as the deity. By the time we get to HYT, this is all completely abandoned, since now we are to understand, at the time of the result, that all phenomena we experience—aggregates, sense bases, and sense elements—are the display of our own gnosis.

So I think a mature attitude is very much needed.

Malcolm wrote:
If maturity requires lionizing animal torture, pedophilia, knowingly infecting students with HIV, dosing people with hallucinogens without their consent, sexual harassment of nuns, forced labor of juveniles, etc., etc., you can keep it.

Also, the idea that these kinds of behaviors would have been tolerated by the Buddhist community in ancient india and Tibet is ludicrous at best.

There is a very good reason why Lha Lama Yeshe Ö composed Differentiating Dharma from Nondharma where he criticized mistaken interpretations of the practices of union and liberation, as well as other erroneous practices. Then of course, we have the example of Sakya Pandita, who criticized many mistaken practices that spread amongst Tibetans. I am sure he would have been absolutely critical of Trungpa.

You invoke Virupa as an example of unconventional behavior, since indeed after practicing for decades, and meeting the nirmaṇakāya, Nairatmya, and receiving the Hevajra Tantra from her, eventually he was hounded out of his monastery, exiting by walking over the lotus pool on lotus leaves, causing the monastery to realize they had accidentally expelled a mahāsiddha from the bhikṣu sangha, someone who had actually been their chief upādhyāya. When we examine Virupa's life, however, we do not find that he harmed anyone, other than maybe giving a few people heat stroke and flooding a few homes. Quite the opposite, in fact—he put an end to Shaivaite animal sacrifices in many places in South India, and made the people promise to only present Shiva with offerings of vegetarian food and fruit. Virupa derided "unconventional behavior" in his dohas, as did Saraha.

The great translator, Rinchen Zangpo, was able to cause Sangye Kargyal to fall to the ground with a mere glance-- the latter having a habit of teaching while he was levitating.

Jetsun Drakpa Gyaltsen, whom history records only demonstrated the secret mantra path of application, not even a mahāsiddha, technically speaking, was able levitate his vajra and bell during his sadhana according to the brief accounts of his life.

Now, I see no evidence at all that Trungpa was such a mahāsiddha. I observe a man, deeply flawed, who had the institutional backing of Karma Kagyu school, for whom he was an "earner," who also was charismatic, intelligent, likable, and very self-destructive, as many people with serious narcissistic personality disorders often are. He garnered the admiration of many when he was a unicorn, a Tibetan with a smattering of a western education, who spoke English fairly well, though not as well as one would be believe from his very heavily-edited books. He ran his students deeply into debt to pay for the 16th Karmapa's trip, debts that were only finally paid off after his death. Sexual harassment of women in his centers by meditation instructors was endemic from the beginning, as was alcoholism, etc. The problems in his centers were quite enormous. Turnover was very high, membership was iffy at best. Financial problems were very prominent in Vajradhātu by the early 1980's for reasons that are easy to understand. And now, people are beginning to talk, like the Steinbecks, who report that in Boulder, Trungpa's cocaine habit was $40,000 per annum, about to a gram to two grams a day in 1977 prices.

People keep on talking about how this is all "Western" moralizing. But that, of course, is nonsense. Tibetans would have never put up with this business for a second. Tibetans were not rubes. In general, Tibetans themselves were quite allergic to people who expressed unconventional behavior. Tibetans are quite prudish and conventional as a rule.

The reality is that since the time of Sakya Pandita and now, there has been a lot of malpractice in Tibetan Buddhism. There is a lot of malpractice in Tibetan lineages as they have spread to the West. It is not healthy to spend our time lionizing these modern "mahāsiddhas" whose main siddhi seems to have been fund raising from Westerners and Chinese people, who, when exposed to scrutiny, are revealed to be deeply flawed human beings. Justifying their behavior through legends of mahāsiddhas of the past is naive at best and nonvirtuous at worst.

The other world is one in which there is abuse going on. Here there is no charm, just hurt. As far as I know, Tibetans not only can tell the two apart,  but do not hesitate to deal very harshly with teachers whose unconventionality goes beyond the recognised limits of its convention.

Who said anything about inaction?

I’m just saying that one can generate more merits via studying and Dharmic visualization methods (assuming that they are connected to methods from the Lineage Masters), than one could through political activism; let alone more ‘concrete’ methods, e.g. Yantra/Tummo, lower gate/door practices (done correctly and with proper preparation of course), Trekcho retreats, the Visions, etc. and the Five/Six Liberations for others.

Malcolm wrote:
More merits for whom? Yourself?

Sādhaka said:
Therefore what I’m implying above would be the epitome of action; whereas politics is not only less meritorious, but is likely more often than not an form of mental-laziness and distraction.

When it comes to helping sentient beings, they could care less whether you are an arhat or a bodhisattva, or a ordinary person.

This being said, there’s no way to mince the quotes from the Lineage Masters that I posted; it’s pretty straightforward:

Without attaining the Bhumis, one cannot really help sentient beings at all.

Well, then you better get busy if you are going to be any use to anyone and stop wasting your precious human birth owning the libs on buddhist chat forums.

Where's your bodhisattva courage?

Well this is an wrong question for an number of reasons, mainly in the context of the reasons I’ve posted above; however since I myself have not been nearly as diligent as I could be, and have very little qualities to speak of, you’re question here to me personally isn’t wrong. It just isn’t right for the reasons that you were motivated to ask it. I.e. along the lines of “you’re not summoning Bodhisattva courage, because you’re advocating for focusing on practice instead of getting involved with politics”).

Malcolm wrote:
No, I am questioning your distinction between "practice" and and the bodhisattva conduct of the six perfections. Bodhisattvas have the courage to remain in samsara for a long time, eons, aiding sentient beings, going through the paths and stages slowly, life after life. Even if one is a practitioner of secret mantra, one needs to have this courage.

Bodhisattvas can practice the six perfections through their engagement in benefitting sentient beings through their political advocacy for universal health care, etc., things Nāgārjuna recommended in the Garland of Gems.

You seem to have this idea that being involved with politics is all about theories. In reality, it is all about outcomes: clean air, clean water, clean environment, preventing habitat loss, equal rights, peace, etc. Working for these things is bodhisattva activity. For example, ChNN's ASIA is a political organization. ChNN was never afraid to work in the political world. We cannot do very much on our own about these things, but we can help where we can, and that is also a part of our practice.

The other thing you neglect about your Lineage Masters is that they all lived in monarchies, not democracies. In absolute monarchies, of the kind that most pre-modern people lived under, to be involved in political life was to be involved in either working with or working against factions in a court. Their concept of politics is completely different than ours. There was no democracy. But democracy demands educated participation from those who benefit from it. The Buddha himself advocated citizen engagement in their country. He expected people to support their rulers, follow the laws, and so on. Well, we don't have kings anymore. We have Constitutions, which are better than kings, in every possible way. What I am saying is that there is no contradiction between the conduct of a bodhisattva and political engagement in a democracy, like voting, etc.

Mostly, such claims are rubbish, but if someone could do so, it would be along the lines of gaining control over the four elements through samadhi, like the arhat who self-immolated by having gained control over fire by meditating on fire kacina.

Such miraculous abilities are widely reported in traditional literature of all cultures, but never reproduced in front of witnesses.

I can report however that the weather was always terrible around ChNN. He was also remarkably successful in casinos too. However he once quipped to me when shown a picture of one of these miracles of a modern lama who stakes his reputation on such miracles, “get me some concrete and I can do that too.” So you see, my skepticism has some basis.

The word “sham” comes from “shaman.”

As for Ngakpa Rinpoche, his weather making abilities were inherited, and involved controlling nagas. He was quite good at this, which is why he was hired.

There is no such thing as alms or sacrifice or offering. There is neither fruit nor result of good or evil deeds. A human being is built up of four elements. When he dies the earthly in him returns and relapses to the earth, the fluid to the water, the heat to the fire, the wind to the air, and his faculties pass into space. The four bearers, on the bier as a fifth, take his dead body away; till they reach the burning ground, men utter forth eulogies, but there his bones are bleached, and his offerings end in ashes. It is a doctrine of fools, this talk of gifts. It is an empty lie, mere idle talk, when men say there is profit herein.

He defied everyone's notions of what was possible or sane, and showed people something so far outside of conventions of society that if one goes along with his program, expectations and the very foundations of ego collapse.

We can debate Trungpa for centuries, but he may just remain a profound source of creative inspiration for Buddhists who want to blast through the confines of worldly and spiritual conventions.

He was so many things... How could anyone possibly form a true conclusion about him?

If anything, he has mass appeal to western society far beyond the orthodoxy of Mahayana Buddhism. He's the reason why so many of us are here today, studying and practicing in the Tibetan tradition. He moved an entire continent.

I think the topic of insanity is especially prescient with someone like Trungpa, who was clearly playing with the insanity of western culture. He was swimming in insanity itself.

In the end, I think it's what we want him to represent. Everyone sees just their own image of him, merely light refracted through the prism of society. How we view someone like Trungpa speaks volumes more about us than it could ever say about him.

Do we dare deify him? Do we dare to tear him down? Do we even dare ignore him, and everything that he was?

Trungpa was a bold challenge to our vision of Buddhism in the modern world.

Most of Trungpa’s success was a function of his corporate support from the Karma Kagyus and ability to raise money (a lot if it from a cocaine dealer). But he was f*cked. He sexually assaulted a women in public in front of 300 students, with his vajra guards looking on, reaching up under her dress and fondling her vagina.

Frankly I tire of hearing how outrageous and enlightened trungpa was. He was a sociopath with no empathy. The notion he was what the West, meaning America, needed at the time is utter bollocks. Western Buddhists lionize Trungpa to the detriment of Buddhism as a whole.

It’s all coming out now, all the terrible stories, and frankly, anyone who thinks the carnage and destruction trungpa left in his wake is a sign of awakened conduct just has not properly studied the Dharma. It’s really a sad episode in the history Buddhism. Nothing to lionize and uphold as an example.

What happens, when we begin to practice dharma, is that we begin to notice suffering in ways we never did before.

That negative karma is going to ripen when the causes and conditions for its ripening are present, and not before. Only a buddha has the omniscience to determine what causes and conditions lead to the ripening of karma for this and that person. For example, the point of Vajrasattva and other methods in Vajrayana is to eliminate traces of karma before they meet conditions for ripening.

Unknown said:
Republican operatives have buried the actual definition of critical race theory: “a way of looking at law’s role platforming, facilitating, producing, and even insulating racial inequality in our country,” as the law professor Kimberlé Crenshaw, who helped coin the term, recently defined it. Instead, the attacks on critical race theory are based on made-up definitions and descriptors. “Critical race theory says every white person is a racist,” Senator Ted Cruz has said. “It basically teaches that certain children are inherently bad people because of the color of their skin,” said the Alabama state legislator Chris Pringle.

…


If you want to understand why I’ve made these arguments, you first need to recognize that for decades, right-wing thinkers and judges have argued that policies that lead to racial inequities are “not racist” or are “race neutral.” That was the position of the conservative Supreme Court justices who recently upheld Arizona’s voting-restriction policies. Those who wish to conserve racial inequity want us to focus on intent—which is hard to prove—rather than the outcome of inequity, which is rather easy to prove.

…

How should thinkers respond to monstrous lies? Should we mostly ignore the critics as Matsuda has, as I have? Because restating facts over and over again gets old. Reciting your own work over and over again to critics who either haven’t read what they are criticizing or are purposefully distorting it gets old. And talking with people who have created a monologue with two points of view, theirs and what they impute to you, gets old.

Malcolm wrote:
Again, one has to use reasoning, and not merely accept the words in the sūtras literally, at face value.

Suffering is a ripened result. If you experience some suffering, that is ripened action.

But in the real point here is not to try and ripen all our negative karma in this life. It's impossible. We have been taking birth since beginningless time. We have created infinite potentials for karma. The idea that a headache is going to wipe all that away is, well, aspirational.

Of course, since we are in the desire realm, as are the hell realms, animal realms, and so on. Any karma we as humans here can ripen in those lower states and vice versa. But Buddha never taught us that deliberating engaging in ascetic practice where we voluntarily undergo torment will result in liberation.

If someone has a headache, yes, that is a result of action, as all painful. pleasant, and neutral sensations are. Does it eliminate the negative action of taking birth in hell realms? Maybe. But banging your head against the wall is not going to have that effect.

The idea that practice results in suffering is mistaken. For example, some people believe that if you practice tonglen, you will take on the suffering of others. But Sapan ridicules this notion, pointing out that engaging in virtuous practice cannot possible result in suffering. Likewise, the idea that increased suffering is a necessary result of dharma practice is frankly a wrong view and and misunderstanding of the sutra passages Vasana pointed to.

Sakya Pandita would definitely frown on this statement by Karma Chagme:

Take on all vices, sins, and obscurations from previous lifetimes. Then everything that would result in immense suffering in miserable states of existence in other lifetimes is purified simply by suffering from illness in this life

Malcolm wrote:
We have to use logic. Small karmas result in huge ripening. Small sufferings are not going to remove huge karmas.

We accumulate merit because that is good karma. We do so to keep ourselves of the realms of rebirth where negative karmas will ripen fully.

If people really want to understand how this works, they need to study chapter 4 of the Koshabhasyam. For example, if one takes rebirth in the form realm, karma generated in the desire realm cannot ripen there. So it is delayed. Karma can only ripen in the realm in which it was created.

If you are studying with a teacher, but find that in the course of their studies they are verbally abusive, you can leave.

If you find out that a teacher is physically assaulting students, that's a matter for the police, for example, like the famous Merwin Party in Boulder. What CTR did there was actually illegal.

Knotty Veneer said:

This is why there is so much teaching in Vajrayāna about the need to be very careful who one takes as a guru and who one takes as a student. Otherwise, It can end disastrously for everyone, as it did in the case of Sogyal. He did not perform due diligence, neither did they

Knotty Veneer said:
And even if there are teachers who really can introduce the nature of mind, say, through blows or sex or whatever, rules like I'm  suggesting will not inhibit them. If a teacher can bring about such an experience in such a manner no one is abused and no one is gonna complain.

In cases where there is criminal conduct, that is a matter for the authorities. That's been my position all along.

What's much worse, actually, is teachers who have no qualities or credentials to give empowerments, etc., who do so anyway, people who receive ocean promotions, etc.

Generally, if people are worried about such issues, they should make sure their teacher is fully ordained monk or nun who keeps their vows scrupulously. But people like lay teachers because they hang out, have a beer, eat a burger, chat, etc.

A world movement that can weather the revolutionary maelstrom must be prepared to advance a unified world perspective, applicable to all workers, from a shared understanding of its own history to its basic philosophical foundations and method, class orientation, conception of the epoch and strategy for victory.

If you ask any theist, they will tell you you are an atheist for denying creation and salvation. They won't give a fig about your acceptance of rebirth, worldly devas in the deva realms, and so on. To them, you are a godless atheist. And they are right.

Aemilius said:
The dictionary definition of theism is that you believe in the existence of one or several supernatural beings. In this sense Buddha himself is a theist, because the beings in the six realms exist, and enlightened beings exist.

Buddhism is considered atheist or nastika in Indian traditional thought. You can look at the concepts astika and nastika.
An important point is that Buddhism denies that world is created by Ishvara or some other divinity; self and world are created by Pratitya samutpada, Dependent origination, according to the Dharma.
Buddha teaches that deities cannot do so much for one self as one's own well directed mind can do for one self (Dhammapada).

Trivial distinction.

He was one of the first people to argue for international trade liberalization. He was not an advocate of unregulated markets, but he was generally opposed to tariffs. And he was certainly a capitalist, as was the Buddha. Compare these two statements: "Capitol is that part of man's stock which he expects to afford him revenue."

It was founded on the idea of equal opportunity for a white, landed gentry.

When Washington was elected, 1789, only 6% percent of the population of the US was eligible to vote. In 1790, the immigration act was passed, declaring that only free white immigrants could naturalize. It was only in 1856 that every state permitted all white men to vote. In 1870, the 15th amendment was passed, allowing black men to vote. Jim Crow was promptly instituted. Women were not permitted to vote until 1920. While Native people were granted citizenship in 1924, they were not permitted the vote in US Elections in every state until the year I was born, 1962.

Now, what was that about this country being about liberty, democracy, and equal opportunity for all? If one is black, non-white, or female, your liberaty, democracy, and equal opportunity was a hard-won battle fought against rich white men. And it still is.

He wants to, and I agree, to restore the New Deal and the Great Society and improve it. That's called "governing." Not "vision."

Yes, the DNC screwed Bernie, but parties are private organizations, and are not part of the Constitution, and the judge ruled that Bernie had no case.

She is quite different from Trump. She stepped aside. She could have contested those 77,000 votes, demanded recounts and so on. But she did not. She accepted that she lost the Electoral College even though she won the popular election by 4 million plus votes. She played by the rules. He did not. She understands how to govern. He is a dangerous grifter whose only interest is lining his pockets at our expense. She would have made a fine president.

Less well known [than other paradoxes] is the paradox of tolerance: Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them.—In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.

That's a pretty funny thing to say for a man whose monarch is the titular head of the Church of England. In 2011, only 0.5 percent of the population of England was Buddhist. His principle teacher, and mine, has been the political head of a refugee community since 1959. The Sakya Throne holders are one of the oldest political families in the world, barring only the Japanese Emperor.

I have nothing against David Stott (Jampa Thaye) personally. I am sure he is a nice fellow. But I think his views on politics are at best, quaint. For example, he opposes women's choice, usually a position associated with religious conservatives—though it has been hotly denied here that Stott is a conservative at all.

Zhen Li said:
For thousands of years people have been led to believe that only an authoritarian organization employing rigid disciplinary methods could govern human society. However, because people have an innate desire for freedom, the forces of liberty and oppression have been in continuous conflict throughout history. Today, it is clear which is winning. The emergence of peoples' power movements, overthrowing dictatorships of left and right, has shown indisputably that the human race can neither tolerate nor function properly under tyranny.

Although none of our Buddhist societies developed anything like democracy in their systems of government, I personally have great admiration for secular democracy. When Tibet was still free, we cultivated our natural isolation, mistakenly thinking that we could prolong our peace and security that way. Consequently, we paid little attention to the changes taking place in the world outside. We hardly noticed when India, one of our closest neighbours, having peacefully won her independence, became the largest democracy in the world. Later, we learned the hard way that in the international arena, as well as at home, freedom is something to be shared and enjoyed in the company of others, not kept to yourself.

Here is a good definition for you:

Spirituality is a fundamental dimension of wellness. However, scholars have noted that not all spiritual processes are healthy. One of those processes is spiritual bypass, defined as a defensive psychological posture cultivated by a tendency to privilege spiritual beliefs or experiences over and against psychological needs creating a means of avoiding or bypassing difficult emotions or experiences.

Politics is difficult. A lot of people use their spiritual beliefs as an excuse for not dealing that difficulty, fleeing the world, rather than dealing with it. For example, the way Buddha dealt the enslavement of the Śākyas. He watched. He did not flee. He observed.

I have been studying this

PDF https://bdkamerica.org/download/1859 Taishō 1488

Volume 24

The Sutra on Upāsaka Precepts sets forth the moral code to be observed by lay Buddhists. The word upāsaka in the title is Sanskrit for layman. In the sūtra, Sujāta is taught the moral code to be observed by lay followers of Buddhism. Therefore the text is also known as the Sujāta-sūtra after the central  figure. Prescribing the moral code as so-called Mahāyāna Precepts or Bodhisattva Precepts, the work was especially valued in Mahāyānist China.

This work is considered to be an augmentation and adaptation on Mahāyānist principles of the Sujāta-sūtra found in the Dīrghāgama (Taishō 1), Madhyamāgama (Taishō 2), and other works. Because of this relationship to previous texts, and because the quotations it shares from various Mahāyāna sūtras, The Sutra on Upāsaka Precepts provides valuable source material for tracing the history of the development of the Buddhist canon.

The actual amount that causes a bhikṣu defeat, according to Kongtrul, is the value of a bushel of barley, about $4.75 in today's market. So, if a bhikṣu scams a White Chocolate Mocha	Venti at $4.75 they are defeated. And, if they downloaded a movie illegally, valued at a 5.99 rental, they would be defeated as well.

But this does not apply to lay people, for obvious reason, which when spelled out, there is no such thing as a defeat for an upāsaka and two, upāsakas are permitted to carry money and so on, hence such a cap for a defeat is irrelevant and taking anything that is not given is breach of one's upāsaka vow.

Things are becoming authoritarian because the social issues are becoming so numerous that both sides are externalizing the issues to political figures and ideology.

Malcolm wrote:
Some people in America, for example, are waxing authoritarian because a deeply racist man, an American fascist named Donald J. Trump, encourages them to externalize their social anxieties onto "crime and drugs," (aka Black people) and "illegal aliens" (aka people from Mexico and Central America), and "China" (aka, the country whose labor costs were sufficiently low that Americans could by a lot of cheap shit at Walmart, Amazon, etc.).

Henry Wallace wrote in 1944:

The dangerous American fascist is the man who wants to do in the United States in an American way what Hitler did in Germany in a Prussian way. The American fascist would prefer not to use violence. His method is to poison the channels of public information. With a fascist the problem is never how best to present the truth to the public but how best to use the news to deceive the public into giving the fascist and his group more money or more power.

....

The American fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common front against fascism. They use every opportunity to impugn democracy. They use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their own selfish imperialism. They cultivate hate and distrust of both Britain (in 2021, the EU) and Russia (In 2021, China). They claim to be super- patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously, they may keep the common man in eternal subjection.

nightbloom said:
From 1917 until his death, aged eighty-five, in 1938 Laurence Austine Waddell wove an elaborate and painstakingly detailed narrative of old world prehistory that identified the Aryan race as the root of all progress, innovation and civilisation in the past five thousand and five hundred years. Waddell's hyperdiffusionist and virulently racist writings on archaeology and ancient history were widely read in Britain, influencing the works of Fascist intellectuals, such as the medievalist J. H. Harvey, and the modernist poet Ezra Pound (Casillo 1985; Macklin 2008). Today his works, particularly his book The Phoenician Origin of Britons, Scots and Anglo-Saxons (1924), circulate among far-right groups, and can be found on the internet.

These two amendments were meant to fix the constitution. But the 14th were the place where birth citizenship was recognized (excluding native americans),  etc. The 14th reads in part:

All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.

The Social Justice movement is based in this principle, and reinforced by the 15th, 20th, 24th, and the 26th (though that mostly applies to teenagers).

Malcolm wrote:
The difference between Buddhism and conservatism, at base, is that Buddhism maintains a positive outlook on human nature, on sentient being nature.

Buddhism understands that things, conventionally speaking, are born, grow, decline, and perish, and that the process of growth and expansion is inhibited or enhanced by positive and negative actions among sentient beings.

We can find many examples in the Buddha's teachings where he insisted on fairness—one of the most crucial was his insistence that Dharma be taught in the local vernacular. Another was his criticism of varna. "Suvarna" means good color, i.e. gold. The varna system in ancient India was a social color-coding, much like we have today in West, the other end of the Indo-European culture sphere. So is is not surprising that white supremacy exists among Buddhists and the Buddhist Studies academy. It is not surprising that the de facto position of Indo-Europeans has always been supremacist feelings of superiority towards people of darker skin tones (Rome vs. Carthage, for example). We find this all over Indo-European myth and literature. The Indians, Buddhist (in contrast to the Buddha's own sensibilities on the subject) and Hindu alike, kept a careful record of their decimation and subjugation of people with darker skin tones.

It's time Western Buddhists started waking up to the "darker" (perhaps "whiter" is more apropo here) side of our own history, including the reception of Buddhism by Protestant philologists who imputed onto Buddhism a Calvinist apophaticism more in keeping with their own prejudices.

Zhen Li said:
It might be worthwhile identifying what Marx's view of justice was.

For Marx, there is a normative justice that is conditioned by the existing mode of production. So Liberal justice as it exists today would certainly be seen as a manifestation of the bourgeois mode of production. By making people focus on social justice as defined by popular contemporary opinion, whatever it is, true justice or injustice is being obfuscated. So, a true justice, grounded in a distinction of actual evil actions encompasses avoidably depriving humans of value through the exploitation of their labour, alienating them from their labour (which is the source of their human flourishing), as well as actual physical (not culturally specific or normative, e.g. liberally defined) harm committed on people (which may include dehumanising exclusion of certain races and sexes). But he also seems to suggest that the normative justice and injustice corresponds to the character (no doubt conditioned by the mode of production) of the people within a society, e.g.
Ludwig Feuerbach & the End of Classical German Philosophy, I said:
“A particular governmental measure – Hegel himself cites the example of ‘a certain tax regulation’ – is therefore for him by no means real without qualification. That which is necessary, however, proves itself in the last resort to be also rational; and, applied to the Prussian state of that time, the Hegelian proposition, therefore, merely means: this state is rational, corresponds to reason, in so fas as it is necessary: and if it nevertheless appear to us to be evil, but still, in spite of its evil character, continues to exist, then the evil character of the government is justified and explained by the corresponding evil character of its subjects. The Prussians of that day had the government they deserved.

“Now, according to Hegel, reality is, however, in no way an attribute predicable of any given state of affairs, social or political, in all circumstances and at all times. On the contrary.”

Why does thinking/saying "oh noes SJWs in Buddhism" necessarily reflect "white rage" and not, for instance, simply an observation that the ideological framework of her argument is faulty and harmful? I don't understand why scorn for her argument is different from scorn for any other argument that the scorner thinks is bad.

Genjo Conan said:
White hostility toward racial progress--or indeed, to discussions about race--is a pretty well-recognized phenomenon, and it tends to take well-recognized forms.  As I read Gleig's piece, the problem is not that some take issue with her argument.  As I read Gleig's piece, the criticism she's complaining about doesn't concern the substance of her work (unless you feel that "keep playing the victim," or calling Gleig a "dharma pervert" is substantive criticism), but is rather a substance-free attack that is consistent with those patterns of white hostility.  It is different from free-floating snark or scorn because it follows those patterns.

Put it this way: if I beat up a black man because we got in a bar fight, it's simple battery.  If I beat up a black man while calling him the n-word, it might be a hate crime.   There's the action, and then there are the circumstances attendant to the action.  Those attendant circumstances don't change the nature of the action, but they change how we interpret it.

nightbloom said:
The truth is that even careful, reasoned argument with people who are principally concerned with "antiracism," "racial justice" or "abolishing whiteness" will frequently be taken as denial. I know from experience how quickly the viewpoints involved become unfalsifiable. It is really not so different from the kind of Christian who claims that everyone knows, in their heart of hearts, that the Christian revelation is true, but that we're all in denial about it out of pride, insecurity or resentment. Any argument against this position will be taken as just more refusal to see "the truth," and eventually this behavior provokes a backlash. Are some people insecure and unwilling to view themselves as participants in a harmful culture? Obviously (and frankly, I think this applies often to leftists, who refuse to acknowledge how self-serving and counterproductive their efforts are) - but all the rhetoric about "white fragility" and "white rage" is much more sweeping than that.

Take a step back. We're in history here together, not outside of it. The dominant ideological and moral paradigms are not categorically different from the ones that went before, and all the same behavioral patterns are still in play. Fundamentally, some of you guys aren't so different from a bunch of church ladies sitting around and clucking about the unbelievers who "hate Christ and love themselves" or whatever, and socially speaking, it does for you what it used to do for them.

You've said some pretty silly things in this thread, but this tops it. You do realize that "social justice" was something that emerged from Anglo-American analytical philosophy in the late 1960's? No Marxism there.

Why do you think Ven Nāgārjuna would have been using these Sarvāstivādin āgamasūtras necessarily?

Because he is a bhikkhu ordained by the Sarvastivada tradition. The Mahayana Buddhist schools are all heirs of the Sarvastivada school.

And your proof is? Atisha, for example, was a Mahāsaṃghika, this is well known.

If you take any bhikkhu ordained in the Tibetan tradition, you can see that he was ordained by the vinaya Mulasarvastivada, the one who at the root (mule) is the sarvastivada school.

Malcolm wrote:
Mūlasarvāstivādin is considered by historians to be a later tradition that the Sarvāstivādin tradition.

ronnymarsh said:
Likewise, if you take a fully ordained bhikkhu in the Chinese and Korean lineage (and in the traditional schools of Nara in Japan), they will be ordained by the Dharmaguptaka school, which is also a derivation of the Sarvastivadins.

Malcolm wrote:
Maybe.

ronnymarsh said:
Not all adherents have this notion, but basically we Mahayanists are the continuation of this Northern branch of Sthaviravada.
You see, take the lineage of all the patriarchs of Zen Buddhism, for example, as well as Shakyamuni Buddha's lineage in Tiantai, Huayan and Pure Land Buddhism.
In all these lineages we will start with Mahakashyapa, then Ananda, then Sanavasa, then Upagupta. So far, both the Theravada lineage and the Mahayana lineage have the same patriarch.

Malcolm wrote:
Ronny, the Mūlasarvāstivādins trace their line to Rahula, Buddha's son. Not to Upagupta.

ronnymarsh said:
From that point on, Theravada won't have any more patriarchs, but we will. After Upagupta we have Dhrtaka, then Miccaka, then Vasumithra, and others. These are all renowned monks related to the Sarvastivada school, up to the 14th patriarch, Nagarjuna.
The 21st is Vasubhandu, from the Yogacara school, and the list continues (in mutual agreement) to the 24th, Simhabodhi.
Afterwards Ch'an/Zen puts three names linking Simhabodhi to Bodhidharma, but that is not accepted among the other Buddhist Mahayana traditions, however, until the 24th all are in agreement on the succession.

Sorry, this is all unsupportable speculation.

This is very true. No one is less welcome than "allies" on a "radical queer" outing, I can say from experience. I was briefly a member of a YorkU club called TBLGAY, "Trans, Bisexuals, Lesbians, Gays, and Allies at York University."

There was a huge hullabaloo over the supposed overemphasis on "allies" by having them in the acronym. It was changed to "and Asexuals," who are not an oppressed minority and never have been unless they were women, in order to disinclude "allies." They also banned non-POCs from the club collective. Stupid things happen at universities that people blow out of proportion. I was quite offended at the time, but got over it. And the idiot ideologues who ran the club into the ground after I and many others left were replaced by normal people. Life goes on. I don't even think of YorkU anymore hardly.

Yes, and one of things that stands out as a collateral damage of "ideas" is the harm they cause people when dangerous ideas are allowed to flourish unopposed, like the idea one can attain liberation by throwing oneself onto a trident, or that in a few years, since Armageddon is going down, so we have to spend absurd amounts of money subsidizing Israeli defense, or that we have to have a $700 billion+ defense budget, etc. Hence, Buddhists had better be involved in the political life of their nations, or just be navel gazers who get rolled over by whoever the local warlords are, Muslims, Communists, etc.

Buddhism should not get involved in politics. Whatever the political solutions that we have are there because of the political issues that they promise to address. One of the truths of all conditioned things is that all things that are conditioned are impermanent. The issues we have now will eventually undergo different changes and at some point they will become irrelevent. Therefore the political solutions which were meant to address those issues will also become irrelevant. The gaze of the public as well as the commitment of activists are shifting from one issue to another from time to time. When issues are no longer relevant they will move on to the next big issues. They will occupy one bandwagon and when that is of no use then they will move onto the next big bandwagon.

I do question whether Buddhism is just used as a platform or launchpad to propagate people's political agendas. I dont want to mention names but there are so called 'teachers' who instill politically progressive views in their teachers where those who receive the teachings wont be able to clearly distinguish between what is Buddhist and what is political.

Malcolm wrote:
Don't worry. I clearly distinguish between Dharma and my political views. But just as a politically conservative teacher is likely to influence their students to have a conservative point of view, the same is true of politically liberal teachers. Luckily, reality is on the side of the liberals.

The interlocutor in the Madhyamakaśāstra is apparently Sammitiya. It would make sense if Ven Nāgārjuna was a dissident from the same, critiquing it from an insider's perspective and putting authentic words into his interlocutor's mouth in the MMK.

Malcolm wrote:
yes, we infer this from Nāgārjuna's sole state preference, that is, for the avipranaśa theory of karmic residuum, that and the fact that the Sammitiya school was dominant in Andra Pradesh, where he apparently resided.

One, this is quite well known. But a little misleading. Many people have overlooked the fact that the maṅgalam of the MMK is a formula found in the PP sūtras.

Thus, this factoid does not have the implication you seek, i.e. that Nāgārjuna only based himself on the Agamas, since it is directly contradicted by other Mahāyāna works he composed.

The reason he only cites that verse is because the śravaka scholars who were his contemporaries did not understand the meaning of dependent origination.
