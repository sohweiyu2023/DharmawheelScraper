The reason Nagarjuna only cites from the Agamas in the MMK is that his audience are non-Mahayanists i.e. the person in the text with whom he is engaging in a dialogue  is a non-Mahayanist (many people do not realize that MMK is written in the form of an philosophical dialogue with the opponent's position being set forth as well).

His mangalam, however, is taken right from the PP sutras. Not only this, Nagarjuna came from the hearland of Mahayana, Andhra Pradesh. His praises are clearly Mahayana works. Then there is the Ratnavali, which is a Mahāyāna work for certain, and so on.

So it's different saying Dudtsi Jonshing is from Vima Nyingthig or Longchenpa and though it's not really important (sorry for derailing your thread), now I'm really curious where it comes from (and not through whom hehe).

This is the form that worldly advice shows up in Tibetan texts, for example, this slice of advice from the explanatory tantra of Tibetan Medicine:

Keep one’s word. After giving one’s word, it is necessary to follow through. 
Even though one has promised to engage in negative actions, do the opposite. 
Begin positive actions even though delayed. 
Investigate in the beginning, then commit for future benefits. 
Do not accept advice as true; accept it after thorough investigation. 
Think about what is being said, then speak. 
Refrain from telling secrets. 
Do not listen to [petty] woman, and control one’s gossiping mouth. 
Speak freely to without deceit who view one with kindness without deceitful words. 
Be steady, and be happy with present company. 
Do not permit enemies to be free, tame them with skill. 
Support one’s relatives and employees, look for a long while at [those who have been] kind in the past. 
Respect one’s elders, i.e. one’s teacher, father, uncle and so on. 
One mind should be in accord with one’s countrymen, friends, and constant companions. 
In business be strict; when necessary, behave liberally. 
Accept defeat if mistaken; be measured if victorious. 
If one is an expert, diminish one’s arrogance, if one is wealthy, understand it is sufficient. 
Do not scorn inferiors, do not be jealous of superiors. 
Do not depend on evil men, do not make enemies of sorcerers or priests. 
Do not use the wealth of others, and avoid [causes for] retribution and taking oaths. 
Plant one’s feet to have no regrets. 
Do not give power to evil persons. 
One’s mind should be honest, improve the basis of patience and openness. 
It is important to accomplish most activities in a timely fashion.

Luke said:
so why did you...make it seem as though Tibetan Buddhism explicitly forbids ordinary laypeople from owning guns and from using them in self-defense situations?

Malcolm wrote:
I didn't. I merely pointed out some statistics around gun violence, what guns are for (killing), and the consequences of using them (death and injury), and that it is much harder to use a gun for self-defense, or even hunting, than most people seem to understand. I have a lot of experience with guns, compared to most Buddhists I know.

Incidentally, Padme -- if you want a gun for self-defense, that will really work when you need it to, don't mess around with a rifle or a pistol. Get a 12 guage shotgun. Learn how to shoot it i.e. pull it tight to your shoulder when firing it, or you will get a large bruise.

Shotguns intended for defensive use have barrels as short as 18 inches (46 cm) for private use (the minimum shotgun barrel length allowed by law in the United States without special permits; most manufactures use a minimum length of 18.5 inches, to give leeway in the case of a measuring dispute). Barrel lengths of less than 18 inches (46 cm) as measured from the breechface to the muzzle when the weapon is in battery with its action closed and ready to fire, or have an overall length of less than 26 inches (66 cm) are classified as short barreled shotguns ("sawn-off shotguns") under the 1934 National Firearms Act and are heavily regulated.
Shotguns used by military, police, and other government agencies are exempted from regulation under the National Firearms Act of 1934, and often have barrels as short as 12 to 14 inches (30 to 36 cm), so that they are easier to handle in confined spaces. Non-prohibited private citizens may own short-barreled shotguns by purchasing a $200 tax stamp from the Federal government and passing an extensive background check (state and local laws may be more restrictive). Defensive shotguns sometimes have no buttstock or will have a folding stock to reduce overall length even more when required.

With a shotgun, accuracy is much less of an issue.

mr. gordo said:
I came across the following passage in the book "The Vision of Buddhism" by the late professor  Roger J. Corless:
When the shinjin has arisen, and the nembutsu says itself, it occurs jinen, spontaneously, naturally, or automatically. Jinen is the Japanese pronunciation of the Chinese tzu-jan, "selfly,"  which is a popular term in Taoism.  It came to be used by Buddhists for the manner in which Buddhas do without doing.   It is a more or less exact equivalent of the Tibetan lhundrup, the spontaneously activity of the Vajra Realm.  The difference between Jinen and lhundrup is not in the spontaneity, but in how one obtains it.  In Vajrayana, one must progress through the stages before spontaneous action takes over.  Shinran found that, in his experience, Amitabha picked him up and placed him directly in the spontaneous energy mode.
Is there any merit in what he says or is he reaching quite a bit here?

I never said that. This is a common opinion but it is not mine. My opinion is that Maitreyanath was a human teacher, a Pandita, who wrote the five treatises. His identification with Bodhisattva Maitreya is really quite late as is the story of Asanga's retreat and encounter with Bodhisattva Maitreya.

My opinion is that after that Maitreya chapter was added to the Perfection of Wisdom sutra sometime after the 6th century (mostly likley as a polemical response to Madhyamaka commentaries on Abhisamaya-alamkara that were critical of Yogacara), the indentity of Bodhisattva Maitreya and Maitreyanatha were conflated because the Maitreya chapter adds Yogacara specific themese to the PP sutras. However, we can be sure that the Maitreya Chapter is a later interpolation because it is missing from earlier, pre-sixth century translations of the PP sutras.

Haribhadra (8th century) was the first author on record to assert the author of the Abhisamayalamkara, and by extension, the other four treatises to be Bodhisattva Maitrya.

Bhavabhata and Bhavyakirit both hold that "This teacher (i.e. Śakyamuni) having attained buddhahood in the beginningless past taught the Cakrasamvara tantras, but later, after becoming the son of Śuddodana, did not teach it. Their reasoning holds that since Cakrasamvara is continually practiced by the heros and yoginis of the twenty four countries, even when eon forms and perished (the twenty four countries) do not form and perish so [the Cakrasamvara] does not disappear. Even though other dharmas may have also been taught in the beginning, since they are destroyed by the formation and perishing of the eon, since they disappear during the interval, they must be taught again by Śākyamuni.

A special feature of Cakrasamvara is that unlike Guhyasamaja, Kalacakra, Hevajra, etc., the mandala of Cakrasamvara is never withdrawn it is not necessary for Śākyamuni to teach it again as it would redundant.

See, coming from an "sportsman" family, I am "gun literate" -- my dad took me out and taught me how to shoot, handle and clean guns when I was seven, in 1969. When I was eight, I was allowed to go out hunting by myself with a 22. I have over the years shot bb guns, air rifles, 22's, 222 deer rifles, 30-06 bolt action rifles, 20 and 12 gauge shotuns, AR-15's, and even Kalishnakov semi-automatics. I have killed birds and other small animals. I also used to fish, also. Never shot a pistol, though, not that I can remember.

One generally speaking becomes good a shooting targers, so if it every comes up, you can hit what you aim at. You usually only aim at living things either to injure or kill.

Injuring sentient beings is not generally consistent with the bodhisattva vow, though there are of course exceptions.

You keep talking about swords -- well, at least with a sword, to use one you take a lot of personal risk -- you cannot harm or kill someone at a distance with a sword. And Golog is filled with bandits.

Especially taser guns; with those there is definitely no intention of killing, they are not designed for killing at all -- just immobilizing the assailant until law enforcement can come to take him away.

The target with real guns in LE training is NOT the head or heart, but the center mass - torso since it is the largest area with the least movement, but for defense, the lower torso with a low caliber could be used. In such instances, a fatality is unlikely to occur.

A non-fatal abdomen shot with a low caliber bullet will not stop a determined attacker. And, given the poor accuracy of handguns, that person is likely to be close enough to harm you.

It is not easy to shoot someone who is attacking you, contrary to popular beleif.

Attacking animals are usually easier to shoot, because they generally engage in a display of aggression before attacking.

If you are not prepared to kill someone with a handgun bought for self-defense, don't buy one.

If you think you can guarantee that you will be able to disable someone with a gunshot in self-defense, think again. Not only is it hard to shoot a stationary target with a handgun, it is even harder to shoot a moving target. Anyone who has handeled guns knows that I am telling the truth.

Generally speaking, the outside range of accuracy of a handgun is 50 yards.

A healthy man can cover this distance in under 10 seconds.

When guns are involved, it is much harder to shoot at someone than you might imagine. We were talking about using guns to defend oneself.

Have you ever tried to shoot at an animal? Have you ever gone hunting? Killing is not so easy. I used to hunt when I was a boy. It is even harder to shoot a human being, without training that is. And what Buddhist wants training in how to kill?

Further, handguns are difficult to use. It is hard to shoot one accurately, even at close range. The larger a handgun is, the less accurate it is, without extensive, and regular training.

Also, as demand for oil drops because of a lack of demand from manufacturing because of oil scarcity (when oil become too scarce, industries that depend on it (plastics, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, industrial agriculture, etc.) will fail unilaterally, the price of oil will drop precipitously, and this drop in price will make these hard to access types of oil even less profitable.

Gun Deaths & Injuries

In 2007, guns took the lives of 31,224 Americans in homicides, suicides and unintentional shootings. This is the equivalent of more than 85 deaths each day and more than three deaths each hour.1

69,863 Americans were treated in hospital emergency department for non-fatal gunshot wounds in 2007.2

Firearms were the third-leading cause of injury-related deaths nationwide in 2007, following motor vehicle accidents and poisoning.3

Between 1955 and 1975, the Vietnam War killed over 58,000 American soldiers – less than the number of civilians killed with guns in the U.S. in an average two-year period.4

In the first seven years of the U.S.-Iraq War, over 4,400 American soldiers were killed. Almost as many civilians are killed with guns in the U.S., however, every seven weeks.5

Homicide

Guns were used in 12,632 homicides in 2007, comprising over 40% of all gun deaths, and nearly 69% of all homicides.6

On average, 33 gun homicides were committed each day for the years 2002-2007.7

Regions and states with higher rates of gun ownership have significantly higher rates of homicide than states with lower rates of gun ownership.8

Where guns are prevalent, there are significantly more homicides, particularly gun homicides.9

Suicide

Firearms were used in 17,352 suicides in 2007, constituting 55% of all gun deaths.10

Over 50% of all suicides are committed with a firearm.11

On average, 46 gun suicides were committed each day for the years 2001-2007.12

White males, about 40% of the U.S. population, accounted for over 80% of firearm suicides in 2007.13

A study of California handgun purchasers found that in the first year after the purchase of a handgun, suicide was the leading cause of death among the purchasers.14

Firearms were used in 45% of suicide deaths among persons under age 25 in 2007.15

More than 75% of guns used in suicide attempts and unintentional injuries of 0-19 year-olds were stored in the residence of the victim, a relative, or a friend.16

The risk of suicide increases in homes where guns are kept loaded and/or unlocked.17

Unintentional Deaths & Injuries

In 2007, guns were the cause of the unintentional deaths of 613 people.18

From 2001 through 2007, over 4,900 people in the United States died from unintentional shootings.19

Over 1,750 victims of unintentional shootings between 2001 and 2007 were under 25 years of age.20

People of all age groups are significantly more likely to die from unintentional firearm injuries when they live in states with more guns, relative to states with fewer guns. On average, states with the highest gun levels had nine times the rate of unintentional firearms deaths compared to states with the lowest gun levels.21

A federal government study of unintentional shootings found that 8% of such shooting deaths resulted from shots fired by children under the age of six.22

The U.S. General Accounting Office has estimated that 31% of unintentional deaths caused by firearms might be prevented by the addition of two devices: a child-proof safety lock (8%) and a loading indicator (23%).23



Gun Deaths & Race

Firearm homicide is the leading cause of death for African Americans ages 1-44.24

African Americans make up 13% of the U.S. population, but in 2007 suffered over 26% of all firearm deaths – and over 55% of all firearm homicides.25



Domestic Violence

Guns increase the probability of death in incidents of domestic violence.26

Firearms were used to kill more than two-thirds of spouse and ex-spouse homicide victims between 1990 and 2005.27

Domestic violence assaults involving a firearm are 23 times more likely to result in death than those involving other weapons or bodily force.28

Abused women are five times more likely to be killed by their abuser if the abuser owns a firearm.29

A recent survey of female domestic violence shelter residents in California found that more than one third (36.7%) reported having been threatened or harmed with a firearm.30 In nearly two thirds (64.5%) of the households that contained a firearm, the intimate partner had used the firearm against the victim, usually threatening to shoot or kill the victim.31

Laws that prohibit the purchase of a firearm by a person subject to a domestic violence restraining order are associated with a reduction in the number of intimate partner homicides.32

Between 1990 and 2005, individuals killed by current dating partners made up almost half of all spouse and current dating partner homicides.33

A study of applicants for domestic violence restraining orders in Los Angeles found that the most common relationship between the victim and abuser was a dating relationship, and applications for protective orders were more likely to mention firearms when the parties had not lived together and were not married.34

For additional information about domestic violence and firearms, including background information and state and local laws on the topic, see LCAV’s Domestic Violence and Firearms Policy Summary.



Costs of Gun Violence

Firearm-related deaths and injuries result in estimated medical costs of $2.3 billion each year – half of which are borne by U.S. taxpayers.35

Once all the direct and indirect medical, legal and societal costs are factored together, the annual cost of gun violence in America amounts to $100 billion.36



Gun Ownership

Americans own an estimated 270 million firearms – approximately 90 guns for every 100 people.37



Gun Crimes

In 2007, nearly 70% of all murders nationwide were committed with a firearm.38

In 2007, 385,178 total firearm crimes were committed, including 11,512 murders, 190,514 robberies, and 183,153 aggravated assaults.39



Youth – Gun Violence & Gun Access

Guns cause the death of 20 children and young adults (24 years of age and under) each day in the U.S.40

Children and young adults (24 years of age and under) constitute over 41% of all firearm deaths and non-fatal injuries.41

In the United States, over 1.69 million kids age 18 and under are living in households with loaded and unlocked firearms.42

More than 75% of guns used in suicide attempts and unintentional injuries of 0-19 year-olds were stored in the residence of the victim, a relative, or a friend.43

A 2000 study found that 55% of U.S. homes with children and firearms have one or more firearms in an unlocked place; 43% have guns without a trigger lock in an unlocked place.44

The practices of keeping firearms locked, unloaded, and storing ammunition in a locked location separate from firearms may assist in reducing youth suicide and unintentional injury in homes with children and teenagers where guns are stored.45

Many young children, including children as young as three years old, are strong enough to fire handguns.46



Dangers of Gun Use for Self-Defense

Using a gun in self-defense is no more likely to reduce the chance of being injured during a crime than various other forms of protective action.47

Of the 13,636 Americans who were murdered in 2009, only 215 were killed by firearms (165 by handguns) in homicides by private citizens that law enforcement determined were justifiable.48

A study reviewing surveys of gun use in the U.S. determined that most self-reported self-defense gun uses may well be illegal and against the interests of society.49



The Dangers of Handguns

From 1993 to 2001, an annual average of 737,360 violent crimes were committed with handguns in the U.S., making handguns seven times more likely to be used to commit violent crimes than other firearms.50

Although handguns make up only 34% of firearms, approximately 80% of firearm homicides are committed with a handgun.51

Women face an especially high risk of handgun violence.52 In 2008, 71% of female homicide victims were killed with a handgun.53

A California study found that in the first year after the purchase of a handgun, suicide was the leading cause of death among handgun purchasers.54 In the first week after the purchase of a handgun, the firearm suicide rate among the purchasers was 57 times as high as the adjusted rate in the general population.55

A 1991 study documenting the effectiveness of Washington, D.C.’s law banning handguns (this law was recently repealed following the U.S. Supreme Court ruling finding it unconstitutional in District of Columbia v. Heller, 128 S. Ct. 2783 (2008)) found that following the enactment of the ban in 1976, there was a 25% decline in homicides committed with firearms and a 23% decline in suicides committed with firearms within the District of Columbia.56 No similar reductions were observed in the number of homicides or suicides committed by other means, nor were similar reductions found in the adjacent metropolitan areas in Maryland and Virginia.57

As a result of its now-repealed handgun ban, the District of Columbia had the lowest rate of youth suicide in the nation – lower than any state.58

For more information about the dangers of handguns, see the Violence Policy Center publication Unintended Consequences: Pro-Handgun Experts Prove that Handguns Are a Dangerous Choice for Self-Defense.

Dangers of Permissive Carrying Concealed Weapons (CCW) Laws

Shall-issue laws permitting the carrying of concealed firearms (CCW) (where law enforcement has no discretion in issuing a permit or license) do not appear to reduce crime, and no credible statistical evidence exists that such permissive CCW laws reduce crime. There is evidence permissive CCW laws generally will increase crime.59

A National Academy of Sciences report reviewing existing data on the effectiveness of firearm laws, including research purporting to demonstrate that concealed carry (also called “right-to-carry”) laws reduce crime, found that the “evidence to date does not adequately indicate either the sign or the magnitude of a causal link between the passage of right-to-carry laws and crime rates.”60

An analysis of Texas’ CCW law, (a law adopted in 1995 that overturned the state’s 125-year ban on concealed weapons), found that between January 1, 1996 and August 31, 2001, Texas license holders were arrested for 5,314 crimes, including murder, rape, kidnapping and theft.61

From 1996 to 2000, Texas CCW holders were arrested for weapons-related crimes at a rate 81% higher than that of the state’s general population age 21 and older.62

Since the Texas law took effect, more than 400 criminals – including rapists and armed robbers – had been issued CCW permits, and thousands of the 215,000 permit holders have been arrested for criminal behavior or found to be mentally unstable.63 The “largest category of problem licensees involve[d] those who committed crimes after getting their state” permits.64

Florida’s CCW system had, just in the first half of 2006, licensed more than 1,400 individuals who had pleaded guilty or no contest to felonies, 216 individuals with outstanding warrants, 128 people with active domestic violence injunctions against them, and six registered sex offenders.65

For additional information about the carrying of concealed weapons, including information on the dangers posed by carrying guns in public, see LCAV’s Report America Caught in the Crossfire: How Concealed Carry Laws Threaten Public Safety and our Carrying Concealed Weapons Policy Summary.



International/Comparative Statistics

The U.S. has the highest rate of firearm deaths among 25 high-income nations.66 Another study concluded that among 36 high-income and upper-middle-income countries, the U.S. has the highest overall gun mortality rate.67

The overall firearm-related death rate among U.S. children under the age of 15 is nearly 12 times higher than that among children in 25 other industrialized nations combined.68

The firearm-related suicide rate for children between the ages of 5 and 14 years old in the United States is nearly 11 times higher than that in 25 other developed countries.69

Americans own far more civilian firearms – particularly handguns – than people in other industrialized nations and U.S. gun laws are among the most lax in the world.70



Guns in the Home/Safe Storage

Living in a home where there are guns increases the risk of homicide by 40 to 170% and the risk of suicide by 90 to 460%.71

Guns kept in the home are more likely to be involved in a fatal or nonfatal unintentional shooting, criminal assault or suicide attempt than to be used to injure or kill in self-defense.72

Having a gun in the home is associated with an increased risk of firearm homicide and firearm suicide in the home, regardless of storage practice, type of gun, or number of guns in the home.73

Rather than conferring protection, guns in the home are associated with an increase in the risk of homicide by a family member or intimate acquaintance.74

The relative risk of dying from an unintentional gunshot injury is 3.7 times higher for adults living in homes with guns, with handguns in the home posing a particular threat.75

States with higher rates of household firearm ownership have significantly higher homicide victimization rates.76

People who keep a gun in their home are almost twice as likely to die in a gun-related homicide and 16 times more likely to use a gun to commit suicide than people without a gun in their home.77

A study of firearm storage patterns in U.S. homes found that “[o]f the homes with children and firearms, 55% were reported to have one or more firearms in an unlocked place,” and 43% reported keeping guns without a trigger lock in an unlocked place.78

A recent study on adult firearm storage practices in U.S. homes found that over 1.69 million children and youth under age 18 are living in homes with loaded and unlocked firearms.79

Keeping a firearm unloaded and locked, with the ammunition stored in a locked location separate from the firearm, significantly decreases the risk of suicide and unintentional firearm injury and death involving both long guns and handguns. These safe storage measures serve as a “protective effect” and assist in reducing youth suicide and unintentional injury in homes with children and teenagers where guns are stored.80

The presence of unlocked guns in the home increases the risk not only of accidental gun injuries but of intentional shootings as well. One study found that more than 75% of the guns used in youth suicide attempts and unintentional injuries were stored in the residence of the victim, a relative, or a friend.81



Guns in the Workplace

In 2009, the most recent year for which data is available, approximately 81% of workplace homicides were committed with a firearm.82

While workplace homicides have decreased steadily over time, the rate of shootings committed by co-workers or former co-workers has remained steady, with an average of 45 homicides by shooting committed by a co-worker or former co-worker per year between 1992 and 2006.83

A 2005 study found that workplaces where guns were specifically permitted were five to seven times more likely to be the site of a worker homicide relative to those where all weapons were prohibited.84



Guns in Schools

A U.S. Secret Service study of 37 school shootings in 26 states found that in nearly two-thirds of the incidents, the attacker got the gun from his or her own home or that of a relative.85



Guns on Campus

College student gun owners are more likely than those who do not own guns to engage in activities that put themselves and others at risk for severe or life-threatening injuries, including reckless behavior involving alcohol, driving while intoxicated, and suffering an alcohol-related injury.86

One study found that two-thirds of gun-owning college students engage in binge drinking, and are more likely than unarmed college students to drink “frequently and excessively” and then engage in risky activities such as driving under the influence of alcohol and vandalizing property.87

Approximately 9 out of 10 college students who were victims of violent crime were victimized off campus.88 Firearms were used in only 9% of all violent crimes against college students over the period 1995-2002.89

Fewer than 2% of students reported being threatened with a gun while at college.90



Gun Trafficking/Private Sales

Interstate firearms trafficking flourishes, in part, because states regulate firearm sales differently and there is no federal limitation on the number of guns that an individual may purchase at any one time.91

More than half a million firearms are stolen each year in the United States and more than half of stolen firearms are handguns, many of which are subsequently sold illegally.92

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (“ATF”) issued a comprehensive report in 2000 detailing firearms trafficking investigations involving more than 84,000 diverted firearms, finding that federally licensed firearms dealers were associated with the largest number of trafficked guns – over 40,000 – and concluded that the dealers’ “access to large numbers of firearms makes them a particular threat to public safety when they fail to comply with the law.”93

According to ATF, one percent of federally licensed firearms dealers are responsible for selling almost 60 percent of the guns that are found at crime scenes and traced to dealers.94

Nearly a quarter of ATF gun trafficking investigations involved stolen firearms and were associated with over 11,000 trafficked firearms – including 10% percent of the investigations which involved guns stolen from residences.95

A 1997 U.S. Department of Justice survey found that 8.4% of state prison inmates who used or possessed a firearm during the offense for which they were incarcerated obtained the gun from the illegal market.96

Random inspections by ATF have uncovered that a large percentage of dealers violate federal law, and that percentage is growing.97

An estimated 40% of the guns acquired in the U.S. annually come from unlicensed sellers who are not required by federal law to conduct background checks on gun purchasers.98

Nearly 80% of Mexico’s illegal firearms and most recovered crime guns in major Canadian cities are imported illegally from the U.S.99

For additional information on illegal gun trafficking and gun tracing, visit the Mayor’s Against Illegal Guns’ Trace Data Center. For additional information about private sales, including background information and state and local laws on the topic, see LCAV’s Private Sales Policy Summary.



Gun Shows

A recent study comparing gun shows in California (a state that regulates gun shows and private firearm transfers) with gun shows in states with little to no such regulation found that at gun shows in states with less regulation, straw purchases were more common, armed attendees selling guns were more common, and vendors were more likely to sell assault weapons and 50 caliber rifles.100

A study by ATF found that 25% to 50% of gun show vendors are unlicensed.101

ATF reviewed over 1,500 of its investigations and concluded that gun shows are a “major trafficking channel,” associated with approximately 26,000 firearms diverted from legal to illegal commerce. Gun shows rank second to corrupt dealers as a source for illegally trafficked firearms.102

From 2004 – 2006, ATF conducted 202 investigative operations at 195 guns shows, or roughly 3% of the gun shows held nationwide during this period. These operations resulted in 121 arrests and the seizure of 5,345 firearms.103

For additional information about gun shows, including background information and state and local laws on the topic, see LCAV’s Gun Shows Policy Summary.



Multiple Sales/Purchases

Handguns sold in multiple sales to the same individual purchaser are frequently used in crime.104

ATF crime gun trace data reveal that 22% of all handguns recovered in crime in 1999 had been transferred to a purchaser in a single sale involving multiple firearms (otherwise known as a “multiple sale”).105

Crime gun trace data from 2000 show that 20% of all retail handguns recovered in crime were purchased as part of a multiple sale.106

As a result of Virginia’s law restricting multiple sales, the odds of tracing a gun originally acquired in the Southeast to a Virginia gun dealer (as opposed to a dealer in a different southeastern state) dropped by 71% for guns recovered in New York, 72% for guns recovered in Massachusetts, and 66% for guns recovered in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massachusetts combined.107

Jurisdictions with weaker firearms laws attract gun traffickers who make multiple purchases and resell those guns in jurisdictions with stronger firearms laws.108

For additional information about multiple sales or purchases of firearms, including background information and state and local laws on the topic, see LCAV’s Restrictions on Multiple Purchases or Sales of Firearms Policy Summary.



Assault Weapons/Large Capacity Ammunition Magazines

A study analyzing FBI data found that 20% of the law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty from 1998 to 2001 were killed with an assault weapon.109

As of 1994, 21% of civilian-owned handguns and 18% of all civilian-owned firearms were equipped with magazines that could hold 10 or more rounds.110

Guns equipped with large capacity magazines were involved in 14% to 26% of gun crimes prior to the federal assault weapon ban in 1994 (the ban expired in 2004), as compared with assault weapons, which accounted for 6% of gun crimes.111

Anecdotal evidence from law enforcement leaders suggests that military-style assault weapons are increasingly being used against law enforcement by drug dealers and gang members.112

For additional information about assault weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines, including background information and state and local laws on these topics, see LCAV’s Assault Weapons and Large Capacity Ammunition Magazines policy summaries.



Non-Powder Guns

Non-powder guns, including BB, air and pellet guns, injured 25,580 people in 2006, including 17,325 children age 19 or younger.113

From July 1993 to July 2003, non-powder guns caused 40 deaths nationwide.114 Although injury rates for non-powder guns appear to have declined significantly since the early 1990’s, non-powder guns are becoming more powerful and more accurate, and are often designed to appear almost indistinguishable from firearms.115

For additional information about non-powder guns, including background information and state and local laws on the topic, see LCAV’s Non-Powder Guns Policy Summary.



Personalized Firearms

Personalized firearms, also known as “smart” or “owner-authorized” guns, are firearms that can only be fired by the lawful owner or other authorized users. A 2003 study analyzing data from seven years of unintended firearm deaths or deaths of undetermined intent found that 37% of the deaths could have been prevented by a personalized gun.116

The view of Madhyamaka applies for common and uncommon Mahayana, but the path of sutra and tantra are different and many concepts are different.

So here, we were discussing the idea of the three kāyas and Dharmakāya in particular from a Madhyamaka common Mahayana perspective. You might find it profitable to consult Mipham's comments in Introduction to the Middle Way, pg. 338-334.

It really depends on how you are defining dharmakāya and in what context.

So you need to decide whether we are talking about Madhyamaka, or we are talking about secret mantra tenets. If the latter, than we need to start a seperate thread. There is no concept of "dharmakāya of the basis" in Sutra.

The controversy is over whether there is a difference in view between Yogacara and Madhyamaka.

gzhan stong pas are Tibetan partisans of Yogacara who assert a)there is a diference between Cittamatra and Yogacara, and b1) Yogacara is either higher than Madhyamaka b2) or is a form of Madhyamaka with a difference in emphasis.

Basically, there are three alternatives:

Madhyamaka is higher than Yogacara
Madhyamaka and Yogacara have the same meaning with different emphasis
Madhyamaka is inferior to Yogacara.

It is not correct to call Prasangika a rang stong view.
Emptiness like space (svatantrika) clearly seems to be an empty-of-self view.
Svatantrika is another Tibetan fabrication. There is no difference between the views of Bhavavike and Candrakirti when it comes to ultimate truth -- the difference between them is soley pedagogical.
Free from extremes beyond thought and expression - you are saying this is neither a self-empty nor an other-empty view?

Malcolm wrote:
How could freedom from extremes be intrinsically or extrinsically empty, based on the Nāgārjuna citation I provided above?

Here is another one:

Since arising, abiding, and perishing are not established, the conditioned is not established. 
Since the condition is never established, how will the unconditioned be established?

Basically the rang stong/gzhan stong controversy is bullshit, and so is the prasangika/svatantrika controversy.

If you want to understand Madhyamaka, don't read Tibetan accounts of Madhyamaka dating after the 13th century. And here, it is better still just to rely on Indian masters. The sole exception to this is Khenpa Shenga's treatises, which are just Indian commentaries turned into footnoted annotations of root texts.

By equating Rangtong with a Shentong-created straw-man, do you mean that the so-called 'Rangtong' is simply Madhyamaka properly understood, or do you mean that the two views are in fact complementary and not contrasting?

Malcolm wrote:
I mean that there is no rang stong at all from a Madhyamaka perspective: Nāgārjuna states:

If there were something subtle not empty, there would be something subtle to be empty, 
as there is nothing not empty, where is there something to be empty?

I mean that there is no rang stong at all, apart from what the gzhan stong pas have fabricated.

The gzhan stong controversy arose out of a need by Tibetans to reconcile the five treatises of Maitreya with Nāgārjuna's Collection of Reasoning based upon the erroneous historical idea that the five treatises were authored by the bodhisattva Maitreya rather than a human being (who incidentally was probably Asanga's teacher).

In my opinion, the five treatises were a collection of texts meant to explicate the three main thrusts of Indian Mahāyāna sutras, Prajñāpāramita, Tathāgatagarbha, and Yogacāra. Four of the five are devoted to these three topics independently, with the Abhisamaya-alaṃkara devoted to Prajñāpāramita; Uttaratantra devoted to Tathāgatagarbha; and the two Vibhangas devoted to Yogacāra . The last, the Sutra-alaṃkara is an attempt to unify the thought of these three main trends in Mahāyāna into a single whole, from a Yogacara perspective.

When these treatises arrived in Tibetan, at the same time, a text attributed tothe original Bhavaviveka, but probably by a later Bhavaviveka, translated under Atisha's encouragement, called Tarkajvala, presented the broad outline of what we know call today " the four tenet systems".

In this text, the three own natures and so on were presented in a very specific way from a Madhyamaka perspective and labelled "cittamatra".

So, the gzhan stong controversy (with additional input from Vajrayāna exegesis based on a certain way of understand the three bodhisattva commentaries) is about reconciling Madhyamaka with Yogacara.

Personally, I see no need to attempt to reconcile Madhyamaka and Yogacara. Madhyamaka is the pinnacle of sutra explication. But Tibetans did and still seem to need to do so, and they have passed on this need to their students.

But from my perspective, one cannot go beyond freedom from extremes.

Your next statement presumes that those debating gzhan stong and rang stong have realized emptiness.

Since rang stong is just a strawman set up by gzhan stong pas, there is really no debate between gzhan stong and rang stong since there is no rang stong Madhyamaka except in the imagination of those who call themselves "gzhan stong" Madhyamakas.

Many translators use non-dual for a variety of subjects within view and methods: emptiness & clarity, emptiness & bliss, emptiness & non-thought, emptiness & awareness, meditator & yoga/path/view, meditator & guru/deity, meditator & trikayas, Kadak & Lhundrub, etc. etc.

And often enough translators decide to translate dbyer med as non-dual, even though dbyer med is asaṁbhedaḥ, inseparable.

I am just a bigger pain in the ass than most translators and more insisitent that translations reflect and are completely consistent with buddhist view so that crypto-hindu notions stay out of our school.

In translations of texts and by teachers who speak English, non-dual is often used in numerous instances of various methods and view explanations within Dzogchen alone, so it depends on the context and the stage and that particuar teaching.

Malcolm wrote:
"Non-dual" i.e. gnyis med/advaya means the absence of the duality of being and non-being.

In Yogacara, it can mean absence of subject and object, but the reason for this is that ultimately there is an absence of being and non-being.

Even when we talk about the inseparability of original purity and natural formation, kadag and lhundrup, this inseparability is actually predicated on the non-duality that I mentioned above. When we talk about freedom from the four extremes, the eight extremes and so on, it is all, in the end predicated on the absence of being and non-being. That absence of being and non-being is the essence of what the term "non-dual" means in Buddhist texts.

It is not a translation or terminology issue, it is just a basic fact of Buddhist view.

The great 11th Nyingma scholar Rongzom points out that only Madhyamaka accepts that its critical methodology "harms itself", meaning that Madhyamaka uses non-affirming negations to reject the positions of opponents, but does not resort to affirming negations to support a position of its own. Since Madhyamaka, as Buddhapalita states "does not propose the non-existence of existents, but instead rejects claims for the existence of existents", there is no true Madhyamaka position since there is no existent found about which a Madhyamaka position could be formulated; likewise there is no false Madhyamaka position since there is no existent found about which a Madhyamaka position could be rejected.

But the Vajrayanists - especially Tibetan Buddhists - claim that indulging in sexual practices is a must for one to attain enlightenment. There are many examples of Tibetan Yogis who attained enlightenment like this.

Malcolm wrote:
Vajrayanist assert that in this day and age no one can give up attachment to sensual objects, therefor objects used for one's own gratification must be taken into the path. Hence the many kinds of offerings you find in Vajrayāna.

However, even in Vajrayāna the purpose is not to indulge the afflictions but rarther to transform the basis from which they arise. If you truly perceive everything to be a mandala of deities, than you will cease to engage in attachment and aversion. When that happens, you will cease to activate the three poisons.

So, the approach of Vajrayāna is to transform, rather than renounce.

This is not what pointing out means in Vajrayāna. The koan process and the process of pointing out instruction in Dzogchen is completely different.



ray said:
An example of pointing out in Zen that is also a Koan is that the Buddha went to the front of the assembly, sat down, and held up a flower and smiled.  Mahakashyapa's mind opened--he saw what was being pointed out.  Sometimes a teacher would tell the students to leave.

Malcolm wrote:
No, Mahakashyapa was already awake. In Zen, transmission is given by one awakened person to another (theoretically). Transmission is never given to a complete beginner, as in Vajrayana.

ray said:
When they were all leaving, he would ask them where they were going.  When they turned around, he would say, "What is it?" or shout "Katz!"  When students asked a question or gave an answer and the teacher shouted, "Katz!", this functions to stop the thinking and bring awareness out clearly, sserving the same purpose as "PHAT!" does in Dzogchen practice or empowerment.

Sorry, but this is incorrect. Zen completely lacks the presentation of the basis, the introduction of the three kāyas, etc., etc.

This is a misconception. Zen does not go beyond sutra. There is no experiential direct introduction in Zen or Chan.

Rigpa is the knowledge you have that allows you to wake up.  Rigpa is a complicated word in Dzogchen texts, and has different meanings in different contexts, but generally it just means knowledge, which in English is the antonym of ignorance (ma rig pa).

"...nihilism, monism, irrationalism, misology, agnosticism, scepticism, criticism, dialectic, mysticism, acosmism, absolutism, relativism, nominalism, and linguistic analysis with therapeutic value."

What a loads of 'ism's!!! Of course today the debate continues, as it has ever since Arya Nagarjuna, as to what the Madhyamaka he set forth actually is.

"I have heard, Lord, that they do."

Sakya Pandita addresses this question extensively in his reply to Nyemo Gomchen:


There are two kinds of Buddhist panditas and Buddhist kusalis i.e. the panditas and kusalis of the perfection vehicle will become Buddhas, but it takes a long time, three incalculable eons and so on. The pair of panditas and kusalis of the secret mantra vehicle quickly attain Buddhahood because of the arrangement of inner interconnections.  In addition, a so called “pandita” is described as “A scholar in the foundation of outer and inner objects of knowledge.” A so called “kusali” is described as “One who inwardly has the most dedication inwardly after severing all outer distractions.”

In terms of actual perfect Buddhahood: first, having become knowledgeable about all objects of knowledge the pandita has severed doubt through hearing, reflection and meditation. Then, because of severing doubt through meditating which makes samadhi essential, gradually attains Buddhahood after actualizing the Dharma of realization is a pandita. A kusali necessarily has the same basis, but when considered alone, a pandita is closer to Buddhahood.

Now then, if it is wondered whether there is a conflict with the statement in The Ratnakuta sūtra:
Compared with someone who listens for ten eons
and then gives explanations to others,
when someone who meditates for just a moment,
the merit of the latter is greater than the former.
The intent of that: the intention is that mediation is when a scholar understands the meaning of the object of meditation, but without understanding what sort of beneficial qualities can there be? Also Vinaya states:
Don’t meditate in mountain retreats without being a master of the canon.
The Abhidharmakośa states:
Possessing basis of discipline, hearing and reflection,
is best applied in meditation.
And as the Āryācharya Nāgārjuna states:
Without relying on convention,
the ultimate will not be realized,
without realizing the ultimate,
nirvana will not be attained.
Therefore, since it is said many times “…liberation is attained in this life by listening the categories from all the sutras”, it is said that “…if one is not liberated by hearing, later on one should meditate.”

I can "get rid" of fixed objects, a fixed self, and so on, but I cannot "get rid" of this awareness. The flow of dependent arising appears to something, which doesn't appear at all.

Malcolm wrote:
What you are talking about is called "clarity". The mind can take it's own awareness as an object.Indeed, in all Mahamudra and Dzogchen meditation, this is precisely what is taken as the object. You may not be able to "get rid" of this clarity, but you will never find it or be able to say "This is it, this is not it". This clarity is also dependently originated since the mind is dependently originated. There is no awareness or clarity seperate from the mind. The characteristic of the mind is clarity. The essence of the mind is emptiness. These two are non-dual, and that is the nature of the mind i.e. inseperable clarity and emptiness.

For all these reasons it is designated as being luminous-clarity.

Hi Greg:

dharmadhātu is chos dbyings or chos kyi dbyings.

In tibetan, dbyings can mean "space". But dhātu can never mean space. Dhātu, in Sanskrit, means "a mine" or "a source".

Some western translators naively translate "dbyings" as space because dbyings can have that connotation in Tibetan.

But chos kyi dbyings is never defined in Tibetan by Tibetan masters as the "space of phenomena".

It is often defined as a chos kyi 'byung gnas i.e. a source of phenomena however. One notable example of someone who gives "a source of phenomena" for dharmadhātu would be Longchenpa in the chos dyings mdzod.

Canto Twenty-Four

Amazing!
Now then, sole fortunate dear children,
listen to this vajra song with joy and enthusiasm!
If realized in that way, the whole of existence
is the ultimate mandala of a book of advice
in which baseless, forever liberated non-grasping words
are written on the pages of various white and red appearances
with the pen of vidyā’s self-originated primordial wisdom.

Having read the book in the state of non-dual appearance and emptiness,
the naturally formed maṇḍala of the billion world cosmos
is wetted with the water of a natural downpour of heavy rain,
the lane is marked with the natural great lines,
and one’s footprints are images of colored sand.
One’s body is the form of the yidam deity of appearance and emptiness,
the empty sounds of speech is vajra recitation
and the self-liberated mind of the deity does not grasp memories or thoughts.
All motions of the limbs are mudras.
All food and drink is an offering of dharmatā.
All apparent forms are the form of the deity.
All loud noises and speech are music.
Naturally occurring samaya is not protected and cannot be harmed.
No matter what such yogins do,
since their instructions and creation stage along with
commitments are perfect in the state of luminous dharmatā, [145]
there is no need to depend on dharmas of effort.
Effortless siddhi is very amazing.
Rapid attainment is a special feature
of the great perfection, fortunate heart children.

As such, if one practices with confidence,
just like clouds disappear into space,
the mass of concepts of samsara and nirvana will be purified in the original ground.
Just like the disc of the sun is clear without any obscuration,
after one’s vidyā manifests the luminous dharmakāya,
one will be able to revive the dead and be able to understand what is hidden.
Having demonstrated various miraculous abilities,
one will tame migrating beings.
Having totally perfected all the qualities of the stages and paths,
the persons of the best capacity are liberated in this lifetime
and the medium are liberated in the bardo at the moment of death.
Having been liberated in the originally pure basis, after permanently dwelling
as the three kāyas and primordial wisdoms (that are never joined with one another or separated) in the dharmadhātu,
also send forth emanations to tame whoever is to be tamed,
performing the benefit of migrating beings without interruption.

Bearing these words and topics in mind,
it is certain the sun of happiness will arise from inside.
That one who sings a song of such realization,
appears to be the renunciate, Tsogdrug Rangdrol.
By this merit, may all the stains of the conceptual affliction
of ignorance of many fortunate disciples
be quickly purified into the originally pure original dharmadhātu
and the result be attained in this life.

Not true, many Indians were sold into slavery.

As far as slavery among North American Indians

"Many Native American tribes did practice some form of slavery before the European introduction of African slavery into North America; but none exploited slave labor on a large scale.[1]
Native American groups frequently enslaved war captives whom they primarily used for small-scale labor.[1] Some, however, were used in ritual sacrifice.[1] Although not much is known about them, there is little evidence that these slaves were considered racially inferior to the Native Americans who held power over them.[1] Nor did Native Americans buy and sell captives in the pre-colonial era, although they sometimes exchanged enslaved individuals with other tribes in peace gestures or in exchange for their own members.[1] In fact, the word "slave" may not even accurately apply to these captive people.[1] Most of these so-called Native American slaves tended to live on the fringes of Native American society and were slowly integrated into the tribe.[1]
Until European settlers arrived, these slaves were other tribesmen.[1] The situation of these enslaved Native Americans varied among the tribes. In many cases, enslaved captives were adopted into the new tribes to replace warriors killed during a raid.[1] Enslaved warriors sometimes endured mutilation or torture that could end in death as part of a grief ritual for relatives slain in battle.[1] Some Native Americans would cut off one foot of their captives to keep them from running away. Others allowed enslaved captives to marry the widows of slain husbands.[1] The Creek, who engaged in this practice, treated children born of slaves and tribal members as full members of the tribe rather than as enslaved offspring.[1] Several tribes held captives as hostages for payment.[1] Various tribes also practiced debt slavery or imposed slavery on tribal members who had committed crimes; full tribal status would be restored as the enslaved worked off their obligations to the tribal society.[1] Other such slave-owning tribes of North America included Comanche of Texas, Creek of Georgia, the fishing societies, such as the Yurok, that lived along the coast from what is now Alaska to California, the Pawnee, and Klamath.[2]
When the Europeans “discovered” the Native Americans they began to participate in the slave trade.[3] Native Americans, in their initial encounters with the Europeans, attempted to use their captives from other tribes as a “method of playing one tribe against another” in an unsuccessful game of divide and conquer.[3]
The Haida and Tlingit who lived along southeast Alaska's coast were traditionally known as fierce warriors and slave-traders, raiding as far as California.[4][5] In their society, slavery was hereditary after slaves were taken as prisoners of war.[4][5] Among some Pacific Northwest tribes, as many as one-fourth of the population were slaves.[4][5]"

Popular coups generally installed tyrants, who often became or remained popular rulers, at least in the early part of their reigns. For instance, the popular imagination remembered Peisistratus for an episode - related by (pseudonymous) Aristotle, but possibly fictional - in which he exempted a farmer from taxation because of the particular barrenness of his plot."

The standard bio of Milarepa by Tsang Nyon Heruka, is quite late and stands a number of facts on their head when it is compared to bios composed by Gampopa, and so on (for example, Milarepa's mother is never mentioned, his father was alive, there was no evil Aunt and Uncle, etc. ).

Basically, Roberts tracks all of the hagiographies of Mila in an effort to find out why Mila's main student, Rechungpa, and only complete lineage holder, was turned into an example of the "bad student" par excellence by generations of Kagyu monastics.

Well, we've already had a long thread in which some people expressed alarm at the proliferation of anti-Islamic sentiment in Europe, and others justified it as well founded.

I don't wish to start another long, tiring debate; but I think it is worth remembering all that was said on that thread.

As one of the people expressing alarm, well, unfortunately there is now compelling evidence why such a stance is warranted.

As an aside, it is interesting how a Christian doing an unspeakable deed is characterised as "a lone psychotic gunman" (not a Christian terrorist) and no one is blaming the entire religion of Christianity for his action.

Malcolm wrote:
That's not true, Huffpo has it here:

"Anders Behring Breivik is a Christian terrorist determined to touch off a new Christian-Muslim war that would rival medieval Crusades."

And there are certainly precedents even in the New Testament for such actions:

Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. [Mt 10.34 NRSV]

For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law; and one’s foes will be members of one’s own household. Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me; and whoever does not take up the cross and follow me is not worthy of me. Those who find their life will lose it, and those who lose their life for my sake will find it.  [Mt. 10.35-39]

Now granted, there is a preponderance of evidence that Jesus would not have approved of the various wars and so on fought in his name. However, militant Christians usually look to the Old Testament for justifications for their wars, as you must know.

Now, it is ironic that man trying to start a race war in Europe chose to murder Socialists, rather than Muslims.

A Christian View of Liberation
Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa (1401 – 1464):
“Finally, there is still a path of seeking God within yourself: the path of the removal of limits…When…you conceive that God is better than can be conceived, you reject everything that is limited and contracted…“if you seek further, you find nothing in yourself like God, but rather you affirm that God is above all these as the cause, beginning, and light of life of your intellective soul…You will rejoice to have found God beyond all your interiority as the source of the good, from which everything that you have flows out to you.”


A Buddhist View of Liberation
Buddha:
“Shariputra, this very Dharmakaya is called the realm of beings when it is concealed by a sheath of boundless afflictions, wandering repeatedly through births and deaths in beginningless samsara, buffeted by the waves of samsara… Shariputra, this very Dharmakaya is called the Tathagata, Arhat, Samyak-sambuddha when it has become free from the veils of all the afflictions, has passed beyond all sufferings…”

The first is completely externalist. The later is pointing to one's inner reality of buddhanature as dharmakāya.

Christian Renunciation
St. Symeon (11th century):
First of all seek three things: (1) to free yourself of all anxiety regarding both real and imaginary things, (2) to strive for a pure conscience, with no lingering sense of self-reproach, and (3) to be completely detached, so that your thoughts are not drawn to anything worldly, not even to your own body.


Buddhist Renunciation
Buddha:
“Do not engage in any vices whatsoever. Devote yourself to a bounty of virtue. Completely subdue your own mind. This is the teaching of the Buddha.”

Renunication is not unique to Buddhism, nor is disciple, nor is loving kindness and compassion. Nor is shamatha.

When one becomes aware that one is seeing a blue vase for example, and desginates it a blue vase, at that moment one is no longer having a direct perception but a perception mediated by ideation and a number of other mental factors.

An important part of shamatha practice is allowing our mental factors to become reduced to the minumum that are present in any desire realm mind -- then we can enter the the first dhyana, i.e. perfect shamatha which involve five factors associated with the first dhyana; one pointedness, bliss, ease, intitial attention and sustained attention.

Perfect shamatha is basically a one pointed mind that is "non-conceptual" or rather minimally conceptual. One of the key features of Vajrayāna practice of course is that bliss can be so overwhelming that it makes our minds completely non-conceptual, likewise, the experience of khumbhaka, etc. This is one of the resasons why the Sakya gongma maintain that Mahāmudra upadeshas all by themselves are a slow path, but when combined with the completion stage, they become a rapid path.

Then other members (vajra practionners) generally quite knowledgeable concerning the dharma did pretend the same, pretending that he did adapt his teaching to the peoples in Palestin in that time. Of course I did'nt agree at all, and as too many of them did pretend so, I tell them that I will ask for confirmation to a Rinpoche (Gelug) I'm in contact with.

You have stop affecting your non-affectation.

I know many, many so called Dzogchen practitioners in DC and elsewhere, both teachers and students. All of them are still, to some degree or another, under the influence of their emotions, their physical bodies, their karma and their circumstances.

So the problem is not with the teachings, the teachings are perfect. The problem is with the practitioners. And the problem is in general that Dzogchen is far more subtle than students understand. The teachers know this, which is why they continue to encourage people not to think that Dzogchen is something so easy. Even a teaching like dependent origination is very subtle. How much more so is Dzogchen, which is where the teaching of dependent origination leads one in the end.

So, Dzogchen words are simple, but their meaning is extremely subtle, and the practice of Dzogchen is not so easy. If you tell people otherwise, you are acting like a Mara.

Namdrol-lags,

Actually I did already before I posted that last post.

(Sorry not to answer sooner, I fell asleep as it was 2 am my time)

What I found on p60-61, was not Je Tsongkhapa disregarding the second set of extremes, but instead saying that they need to be interpreted with (implied) qualifiers, and not literally.  The emphasis is on knowing when and where to apply the "inherently existent" clause in order to avoid a contradiction.

BTW found online "Freedom From Extremes" by Jose I Cabezon and Geshe Lobsang Dargey. Any opinions on this book?

Malcolm wrote:
There are a couple of errors in translation in that book, for example, for some strange reason Cabezon thinks that Gorampa is siding with Rendawa's rather extreme refutation of gzhan stong, when actually Gorampa supports Rongton's softer refutation of gzhan stong. Otherwise, it is pretty good.

Re: tetralemma -- this is the basis of the disagreement, whether to take the tetralemma literally. Gorampa takes Tsongkhapa to task for trying to reinterpet the tetralemma. It must be taken literally, for among other reasons, [one not mentioned in the book], there are those who assert things both exist and do not exist, for example Jain and other interpretation of arising where there is an instant where something is in simultaneous state of existent and non-existence. In other words, the tetralemma is to be taken literally.

The book is ok, but really needs to redone by  Sakyapa.

Malcolm wrote:
You might think that Nāgārjuna disagrees, but he does not disagree. For Nāgārjuna śūnyatā is tattva, the real. If you say, however that śūnyatā is real, you have reified emptiness and are about as far away from tattva, the real, as you can get.

A simple reminder of Descartes should actually be enough to refute this. There is always reality. If something is – it is – and that is reality.

Nāgārjuna, as well as the Buddha, reject this. There is no "is". Nāgārjuna would reject your claim the following way "Apart from what has been, and what has not been, there is no [present] being".

Reality, for Nāgārjuna is freedom from four extremes. Relative truth is free from four extremes, also ultimate truth is free from four extremes.

Flow said:
The question is about what kind of reality you are speaking of. If you speak about absolute reality in the way of 'matter always existing' or 'the self' or 'the Buddha' or what not – then of course you point into the right direction. But you are not correct to assert that there is no-thing. Nothing can not be.

Malcolm wrote:
I did not assert existence, therefore, I cannot be accused of asserting non-existence. When you discover your bank account is empty, you say you have no money. When you investigate things and find out that they have no reality, that is not an assertion of non-existence. It is not my fault if things fail the reality test. Apart from things (dharmas,material and mental), there is nothing else that could be real.


Flow said:
And what is not is not. This is a semantic problem. Nothing more. In Bön the concept of aware space is utilized: Emptiness – but emptiness is not nothingness. At least not in the Bön teaching. What you proclaim here is actually nihilism. And that is not dharma. Seriously.

Malcolm wrote:
Nihilism is only the assertion that something which existed no longer now exists [ucchedavāda]. For those who do not assert existence, the fault of non-existence cannot be applied.

In order for there to be reality to be established, something must be established to exist. If nothing can be established to exist, for what reason can reality be established to exist. Likewise, Nāgārjuna has said "Since arising, abiding and perishing are not established, the conditioned is not established. Since the conditioned is not established, how will the unconditioned be established?" Likewise he states elsewhere, "If there were something slightly not empty, there would be something that could be empty; but as there is nothing that is not empty, where is there something that could be empty?"

Nāgārjuna, you see, is quite uncompromising in his anti-realism.

Flow said:
Buddhist philosophy is not afflicted with this radical dualism. Mind and matter are two sides of the same coin. Everything is part of a single continuous reality. But, of necessity, we may analyze out and abstract certain aspects of reality by way of our intellect. However, this does not make these distinct aspects separate realities or separate substances. Mind and matter are part of a single whole; they are not separate orders of being.'

Malcolm wrote:
This is all just relative truth. He is referring to the issue of Cartesian dualism. He is incorrect however in one thing -- from Yogacara on down, there Buddhist philosophy does maintain a substance dualism between mind and matter. Madhyamakas don't really care much what your correct relative truth, provided that it is efficient, i.e. when you plant a seed, it produces a sprout, while at the same time rejecting realist arguments to explain the process of germination.

Flow said:
'Mind and matter are part of a single whole; they are not separate orders of being.'
→ 'Consciousness is the 'root' of reality.'

Malcolm wrote:
How can you say that consciousness is the root of reality of you maintain that consciousness and matter are part of a single whole? Further, how can you given primacy to consciousness if you regard consciousness and matter as a single whole?

But please remember that we are bound by language and that language can by constitution only be the map to the territory we are speaking about... So don't get hooked up on terms, please. Logic proving the  conceptual system itself - cannot penetrate into the non-conceptual - the non-dual.

Malcolm wrote:
Not all non-dualities are the same. Buddhist non-dualism is epistemic, whereas Hindu non-dualism is ontological. What do I mean by this? Non-duality, for a Mahdyamaka means that in reality, because of dependent origination, the extremes of asti and nasti, being and non-being, are reifications (samaropa) and have no reality. This is the essence of the fifteenth chapter of the Mulamadhyamakakarikas (in addition to issuing a fundamental blow to Samkhya philosophy).

Flow said:
Remember where we started out? I doubted that with your analytical tools borrowed from linguistics based on anthropology, based on evolution theory - you might go wrong in your assertions toward the past of Tibet - or of any other place in the world. This is what I am saying.

Malcolm wrote:
I don't have any assertions about the Tibean past apart from what can be verified for example in Chinese annals, Indian records, Arabian Records, Tibean Records. Everything else, which is only found in Tibetan texts that has no third party independently verifiable source I regard as "tradition". And in this respect Bonpos have their traditions and Buddhists have theres. I thought I should have made it clear that there are traditions in both Buddhism and Bon that I do not regard as objectively factual, even though they may be spiritually meaningful. Such things as the Mt. Meru cosmology and so on. When it comes to history, in the other hand, I think that Buddhism is on much stronger ground.


Flow said:
Then I go on and make the argument that quantum physics implies that 'consciousness' is the 'base', 'root, [in lack of a better term] of reality which opens the door for different models of dependent origination concerning the appearance of life and the cosmos.

We can infer that all human language descends from language spoken in Africa.

Quentin D. Atkinson, a biologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand, has shattered this time barrier, if his claim is correct, by looking not at words but at phonemes — the consonants, vowels and tones that are the simplest elements of language.  Dr. Atkinson, an expert at applying mathematical methods to linguistics, has found a simple but striking pattern in some 500 languages spoken throughout the world: A language area uses fewer phonemes the farther that early humans had to travel from Africa to reach it.

Some of the click-using languages of Africa have more than 100 phonemes, whereas Hawaiian, toward the far end of the human migration route out of Africa, has only 13. English has about 45 phonemes.

This pattern of decreasing diversity with distance, similar to the well-established decrease in genetic diversity with distance from Africa, implies that the origin of modern human language is in the region of southwestern Africa...

When Nagarjuna finds 'the Truth' he does so based on a solid system of logical reasoning.

Malcolm wrote:
As I said you are an idealist. This is a typical idealist train of thought. Buddhism, philosophically speaking, in general is species of nominalism.

Nāgārjuna did not build a system on the basis of logical resasoning. He poked holes in other people's systems because they are all based on false cognitions predicated on naive or formal assumptions of being and non-being. He himself has no system, and neither, for that matter do I. Everything are are discussing however is based on relative truth, and that, as I explained above, is predicated on efficiency. We can certainly entertain the idea that storks delivered us to our parents, and this might well be true, one might say, because after all it is but one of several theories of procreation. But after sufficient observation, you might be inclined to discard this theory for the one that suggests that sexual intercourse is more responsible for procreation.

'not mortal' 'without death' doesn't imply eternity? I am sorry but this is hilarious. I know about amrta pretty well - as I mentioned I am educated in the Vedic source literature. Amrta is the symbol for eternity. You could say it is the endless knot of Sanatana dharma... This is a semantic word game which does not lead anywhere. If 'without death' does not mean eternal what does it mean then? If something doesn't have an end is it not timeless? Since everything subjugated to time has an end? Is timelessness not equivalent to eternity?

Malcolm wrote:

All commentarial gloss aside, it is well known that the Theravadins are slightly eternalistic in their understanding of nirvana, thus their hermeneutics. Sautrantikas, which are a higher tenet system, are unencumbered by this, but are instead encumbered by a subtle annihilationism.
I refute your point by referring to the comment that is essential to understand the verse you quoted and then you simply wind yourself out of it by exclaiming that Theravada is not developed enough and hence 'slightly eternalistic'.

Enochian said:
I highly doubt Tsongkhapa held this view in the first place.

I am sure Tsongkhapa would have agreed with Gorampa that emptiness is a nonimplicative negation of all the Four Extremes, or ANY claim in general.

Malcolm wrote:
No, Gorampa analyzes this in detail.

Basically Tsongkhapa's famous formula for freedom from extremes is "not existent in the ultimate, not non-existent in the relative", he disregards the second set of extremes since they are double negatives and considers it absurd to negate things that "both and exist and do not exist" etc., since things never appear to both exist and not exist at the same time.

So basically Gorampa says that Je Tsongkhapa gets stuck on the level of mind, and what you really need to do is go beyond mind.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, it is a little more nuanced than that, but yes, one criticism of Tsongkhapa is that he holds that the intellectual apprehension of emptiness as non-affirming negation of true existence an appropriate conceptualization because it mimics ultimate truth. Gorampa rejects that emptiness is merely the "non-affirming negation of true existence" as well as the notion that an intellectual apprehension of emptiness is ok.

There are over 150 points where Gorampa criticizes Tsongkhapa's views.

All I am saying is that there might be the possibility for metaphysical accounts of Tibetan Buddhism and Bön to be actually true.

Malcolm wrote:
In terms of the origin and evolution of Buddhist texts? No. Nāgārjuna did not recover the Prajñāparamita Sūtras from sea monsters off of the coast of Andra Pradesh, as romantic as that might sound. Likewise, Buddha did not teach Abhidhamma pitika in one session to the gods in the thirty three heavens, as romantic as that sounds.

One of the nice things about Buddhist texts, especially Mahāyāna texts is that one can study their evolution. Why? Becauase they were translated into different languages over the period of a thousand years. How is the possible? For two reasons -- we have the Chinese canon and the Tibetan canon.

Buddhist sutras in the Chinese canon clearly show textual development over the many recensions of their translations. The Tibetan forms of these sutras are always in more mature forms than the earlier Chinese translations. And interestingly enough, the surviving Sanskrit copies of many sutras and tantras too show evidence of textual development subsequent to their translations into Tibetan. We can see this type of development even between translations from the Imperial period and the so called "later translation period" which begins with Rinchen Zangpo in the late tenth century.

Another thing we notice with Bon texts is that their orthography is solely post Ralpachen i.e. post 840 or so. In other words, we do not find the kinds of archaic spellings in Bon canonical texts in general (such as the Zer mig, etc) that one would expect to find in ancient, pre-Buddhist texts.

So you can speculate all you like about Ancient Buddhas in mythical kingdoms writing down all the Buddhist sutras in independent form and depositing them in Tibet in the some prehistorical period. But the simple fact of the matter is that texts are plastic culture, they are susceptible to evolution and emendation, and in the case of Buddhist texts, these emendations are trackable to a very large degree until the Chinese and Tibetans stopped translating Indic texts. Of course, even in Tibetan Buddhist treasure literature one can find clear evolution and consolidation of language and terminology and very little in the way of truly archaic spellings, etc., spellings we have actual evidence of from texts which clearly date to that time period.

I think you ought to make yourself more useful, and go get a PhD in Tibetan studies somewhere, like Oslo - with Per Kvarne, who has a Bon studies program, university level. Then you can be really, truly insufferable as only academics can be.

Otherwise, you should study Tibetan Medicine, since you stated you wanted to be a healer. There are a bunch of Bon doctors in Nepal. Go study with them.

aparapratyayaṁ śāntaṁ prapañcairaprapañcitam|

Not known from another, peaceful, not proliferated through proliferations,
non-conceptual, undifferentiated, that is characteristic of the real.


pratītya yadyadbhavati na hi tāvattadeva tat|
na cānyadapi tattasmānnocchinnaṁ nāpi śāśvatam||10||

Some thing arisen dependent on some (other) thing, that (thing) is not the same as the (other) thing,
and also is not different from it, therefore, it is neither annihilated and is not permanent (tattasmānnocchinnaṁ nāpi śāśvatam)

anekārthamanānārthamanucchedamaśāśvatam|
etattallokanāthānāṁ buddhānāṁ śāsanāmṛtam||11||

Not identical, not different, not annihilated, not permanent,
that is the amrita (or nectar) of the doctrine (śāsanāmṛtam) of the saviors of the world, the buddhas.

+++++++

Not known from another, peaceful, not proliferated through proliferations,
non-conceptual, undifferentiated, that is characteristic of reality
Some thing arisen dependent on some (other) thing, that (thing) is not the same as the (other) thing,
and also is not different from it; therefore, it is not annihilated and is not permanent. 
Not identical, not different, not annihilated, not permanent,
that is the amrita (or nectar) of the doctrine (śāsanāmṛtam) of the saviors of the world, the buddhas.

Taken together, things are not the same, are not different, are not annihilated nor are they permanent, that is reality. When that is known directly, since it is known that things are free from extremes, also all proliferation regarding things are pacified. That is peace.

The second verse is discussing the meaning of the first verse, its implication for things, which is the summarized as being the amrita, the nectar of the Buddhas teachings. These verses do not concern a transcendent reality, though if you are conditioned by Advaita, you might be inclined to see things that way (a rabbit hole many people never escape from).

Since "not identical, not different, not annihilated, not permanent" is the nature of things because things are dependently originated, therefore, when there are no buddhas in the world to teach it, the doctrine of dependent origination can still be realized by pratyekabuddhas.

No, not eternal, here, rather it is actually amrita, which literally means "without death" and refers to the elixir of the devas, etc. as I am sure you know. It is funny because in the Tibetan, immortal would be translated as 'chi med, but here in Tibetan the word was translated as bdud rtsi which means figuratively the "elixir that defeats the demon of death" i.e. Yama mara.

In any event, we do not have a concept of Sanatana Dharma in Buddhism. For example, Maitreyanatha argues in the Uttaratantra (the main source of teaching on tathāgatagarbha) that the Dharma is not a perfect refuge because it is conditioned and impermanent. Etc.

In practice, though, the "Pointing Out" may seem like an instantaneous thing--but I think most of us have trained in methods that would be considered "preliminary investigations" on the path of Mahamudra, even though we may not realize that such methods were leading to "NgoTro."

However, as Nagarjuna points out (xviii.9-12)

"Not dependent on another, peaceful, and
Not fabricated by mental fabrications,
not thought, without distinctions,
that is the character of reality(that-ness).

Whatever comes into being dependent on another
Is not identical to that thing.
Nor is it different from it.
Therefore, it is neither non-existent in time not permanent. 

By the buddhas, the patrons of the world, 
This immortal truth is taught:
Without identity, without distinction,
Not nonexistent in time, nor permanent.

When the fully enlightened ones do not appear,
and when the disciples have disappeared,
The wisdom of the self-enlightened ones
Will arise completely without a teacher.

In short.

The Lotus Sutra presents a situation where the Buddha achieved awakening five gazillion years ago.

But the Buddha does not present himself as "eternal" in the theistic, Sanatana Dharma, sense of the term. The Buddha states in this chapter that his continued presence at Rajagriha is based on his career as a bodhisattva:

The unlimited illumination of my wisdom 
Is such that my life span is one of countless eons 
Attained through long cultivation and work.

Thus he is not eternal in the sense which you mean. His presence is based on the incalculable causes and conditions created during his career as a bodhisattva.

As regards to the duration of his life there are sources that assert that he lived very many years, calculable only in 'shen years (gshen lo), each equivalent to one hundred human years.

For example, Tibetans have a record of the Samye debate which derives from the Ba bzhad annals. It is just a political hatchet job against Chan.

Official Tibetan History has it that Langdarma destroyed Buddhism in the ninth century. But the real story is somewhat different.

Official Tibetan History has it that there was no writing Tibet prior to Srongtsan Gampo, but this is now under dispute; though whatever the case is, Tibetan and Zhang Zhung writing still clearly derive from Gupta script, which itself ultimately derives from Western Semitic, like all alphabets.

Merely having a record does not make it a historical record, nor does it make it true. For example, we have a very nice record of the Shambhala kings in the commentaries of Kalacakra. But the date of the Buddha in these texts is wrong, at least four hundred years too early, and based on that, then we can assume that many other details of this cycle are wrong.

Zhang Zhung and Bon studies have found their Troy, but still await their Dead Sea Scrolls.

Now, I understand the main point of your argument, namely, that Bon preserves a non-Indic form of Buddhism that in no way depends on Indic Buddhism for its nine yanas. Respectfully, I completely disagree with this assessment. In my opinion Bon completely depends on Indic Buddhism for things like Mahāyāna, Madhyamaka and so on. For example, Dan Martin recently speculated on his blog, Tibeto-logic, that Buddhist sūtras present in the Bon canon are not forgeries, but in fact earlier, abandoned translations (albeit altered to fit a Bon context).

"Because there are no copies of the scriptures that by some method can not be dated farther back than 1000 AD.? Is this reason enough for you to deride a complete lineage and refuse to accept that Tibet had a religion before Buddhism came there? "

Virtually all Bon texts that we have, even most of ZZNG, is terma. That is fine, but you can't date terma texts earlier than their discovery unless you have some earlier texts to compare them to.

You will note that I have not impugned the spiritual value of any of the Bon teachings. Not once.

You will also note, for example, that I do not think it is very likely that Sakyamuni Buddha taught the Lanka. The Lanka, and indeed all Mahāyāna sūtras, tantras, etc., are in my opinion, later compositions. I think there is ample reason to think this is so. I also think it does not destroy their spiritual value at all. I apply the same standard to Bon.

As such, I regard Bon as more or less one more branch on the Buddhist tree, albeit a rather late one, and one that has largely forgotten and neglected its autochthonic teachings, favoring ones imported from India.

Naturally, I expect Bonpos to disagree. They are entitled to. But as you note, there is little, if no, proof of Bon claims to the contrary. That does not mean Bon claims are necessarily false (though in the case of things like borrowed Buddhist texts, this is indisputable), it just means that Bonpos have no record to fall back on in history and archaeology.

Re: Zhang Zhung -- yes, there was a place named Zhang Zhung. It collapsed because of climate change, if you follow Belleza's argument. Also its last king, Lugmincha, was assassinated on the orders of Songtsan Gampo in the 7th century. At this point very little archaeology has been done and we have yet to find any cache of Zhang Zhung texts. If and when we do, then we can rewrite early Tibetan history. Until then, we are left only with fragmentary reports in texts written in a different language. Anything else is either speculation or blind faith.

Incidentally, history and realization are two different things entirely. You should be grateful for materialist science, without it you would not have a web forum to be outraged upon.

Yes. But not in the form you imagine.

You need to read his Drung De'u and Bon. Then you will find out that ChNN thinks that the original, pre-Buddhist Bon was divided into twelve lores, etc.

He says in this book, ppg. xvii-xviii: "The five Bon of the Fruit contain manly teachings that can be found in Mahāyāna and Tantrayāna Buddhist traditions, so one can assume that they were introduced into Bon in a period later than that of the twelve lores; the authenticity and originality of the nine and last "way", comprising the Dzogchen teachings, alone is beyond doubt as its historical inception can be correlated with the kingdom of Shang Shung. In any case we can hypothesize that the Bonpos absorbed elements of Buddhism without recognizing them as such, as some scholars maintain, or that they did so in order to survive to counter the great success of the Buddhist faith. The fact remains that in the contemporary Bonpo canon can be found some of the most important Buddhist texts albeit with different titles, and even the biography of Shenrab Miwoche emulates that of Shakyamuni Buddha. There may have been valid reasons for this work of transforming and adaptation of Buddhist elements, perhaps for the very preservation of the authentic Bon teachings, but this principle was soon forgotten and the importance of the original traditions was neglected in favor of the philosophical teachings derived from Buddhism."

Upon drying, the reddish-brown paste inside the musk pod turns into a black granular material called "musk grain", which is then tinctured with alcohol. The aroma of the tincture gives a pleasant odor only after it is considerably diluted.

However, Tibetan Buddhists are notoriously ignorant of the actual content and context of many of doctrines to which they adhere. Why? Because they rely on abstracted commentaries on India sutra material, such as Sutra-alaṃkara etc., rather than actual sutras.

A quick read of the Sutra-alaṃkara will quickly demonstrate to any clear thinking person that the author of that text had a definitely low opinion of non-Mahāyāna schools.

The question is, is the Mahāyāna use of the term justifiable?

Well, if you turn away from intending to achieve full buddhahood [as defined by Mahāyānists], then you are turning to an inferior yāna, from a Mahāyāna perspective. There are a number of other reason why the doctrine the Buddha taught in the Agamas/Nikayas are regarded as inferior as well. Not in the sense that any of the Buddha's teachings are inferior, but in terms of the intended audience. Mahāyānists use the term to describe an inferior motivation, cessation, arhatship, etc., in an effort to dissuade those who might abandon the heroic eons long mission of attaining full awakening.

On the other hand, it is also important to bear in mind that Vajrayāna texts are similarly critical of those who avoid or do not have faith in Vajrayāna -- for example, the Hevajra Tantra refers to those Buddhists who follow lower tantra and ordinary Mahāyāna as "tirthikas", a term usually meant for non-Buddhists.

So when these terms are used, they are not meant to be categories for ranking teachings overall (and this is the great Tibetan Buddhist hermeneutical error). Instead, the term hīnayāna should only be used with Mahāyāna audiences when the teacher in question is describing the inferiority of the desiring to attain the result of an arhat or a pratyekabuddha as opposed to full buddhahood.

In terms of the whole of Buddhism, however, we are only the fourth largest religion of the planet. In ecumenical Buddhist gatherings it is skillful to avoid using the term "hīnayāna" because it is intentionally derogatory and because there are those who find it offensive, understandably so. We also run the risk of insulting aryas by using the term carelessly.

It does not mean however that when we are discussing with other Mahāyānists where Theravāda would be placed in the Mahāyan̄a scheme of things, that we should pretend that Theravāda is something other than a Hīnayāna school.

This being said, just because someone has ordained in Theravāda does not mean that they are necessarily a hīnayāna practitioner. Just as there were Mahāyānis in other Hīnayāna schools, likewise there have been and are Mahāyanis in Theravada.

But Theravāda itself, like Mulasarvastivada, etc. is a hīnayāna school when considered from the perspective of Mahāyāna.

This is because you haven't yet received Dzogchen transmission and you've read very few Dzogchen texts. The explanations about the mirror and kadag and lhundrub and their inseparability are skillful means to bring about understanding and possibly trigger insight, but they are not meditated upon. So from that point of view they are not the main point. Instead, one relaxes with an utter lack of modification or fabrication or placement or objectification of any kind; though even these words can be misleading because there can be a great resemblance between rigpa and the state of non-conceptual quiescence, even though in reality there is the most profound difference between the two. This is of course why the guru is indispensable: first in terms of helping one recognize one's primordial state and then guiding one so one can stay on course and not fall into deviations that can be difficult to apprehend.


Enochian said:
Well let me ask you or anyone else this.

The key thing in Dzogchen is distinguishing sems from rigpa.

Thus you need some sort of obvious characteristic of sems to distinguish it.

Do any Dzogchen teachings point out the obvious distinguishing characteristic of sems i.e. sems (mind) is always on the Three Times?

I haven't read anything regarding this in Dzogchen material, even though it is quite obvious.....

That however is not how it works in Buddhism. This sutta is instructive:

At Savatthi. Then, early in the morning, Cala the nun put on her robes and, taking her bowl & outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. When she had gone for alms in Savatthi and had returned from her alms round, after her meal she went to the Grove of the Blind to spend the day. Having gone deep into the Grove of the Blind, she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day's abiding.

Then Mara the Evil One, wanting to arouse fear, horripilation, & terror in her, wanting to make her fall away from concentration, approached her & said, "What is it that you don't approve of, nun?"

"I don't approve of birth, my friend."


[Mara:]
Why don't you approve of birth?
One who is born
enjoys sensual pleasures.
Who on earth
ever persuaded you:
'Nun, don't approve of birth'?

[Sister Cala:]
For one who is born
there's death.
One who is born
sees pain.
It's a binding, a flogging, a torment.
That's why one shouldn't approve
of birth.

The Awakened One taught me the Dhamma
— the overcoming of birth —
for the abandoning of all pain,
he established me in
the truth.
But beings who have come to form
& those with a share in the formless,
if they don't discern cessation,
return to becoming-again.
Then Mara the Evil One — sad & dejected at realizing, "Cala the nun knows me" — vanished right there.

As is this one:

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. Then Subha the student, Todeyya's son, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings & courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama, what is the reason, what is the cause, why baseness & excellence are seen among human beings, among the human race? For short-lived & long-lived people are to be seen, sickly & healthy, ugly & beautiful, uninfluential & influential, poor & rich, low-born & high-born, stupid & discerning people are to be seen. So what is the reason, what is the cause, why baseness & excellence are seen among human beings, among the human race?"

"Students, beings are owners of kamma, heir to kamma, born of kamma, related through kamma, and have kamma as their arbitrator. Kamma is what creates distinctions among beings in terms of coarseness & refinement."

"I don't understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama's statement spoken in brief without explaining the detailed meaning. It would be good if Master Gotama taught me the Dhamma so that I might understand the detailed meaning of his brief statement."

"In that case, student, listen & pay close attention. I will speak."

"As you say, Master Gotama," Subha the student responded.

The Blessed One said: "There is the case, student, where a woman or man is a killer of living beings, brutal, bloody-handed, given to killing & slaying, showing no mercy to living beings.

Several months ago in the http://dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f=66&t=3474&p=31274&hilit=connection+with+the+animal#p31274 thread I raised this question:
Where is it taught the use of animal products, and likewise meat-eating, creates a karmic connection with the animals in intentionally using their bodies to fulfill your "needs"? This may not be the karma of killing, but it creates a debt that must be repaid to them, which may result in rebirth as a service animal— a cow or such that is worked and exploited for milk and eventually meat, clothing, etc.— to rectify the outstanding balance due them.
To this Namdrol replied;
By the time the remains of an animal wind up on your plate, their consciousness is long gone, reborn. This is one of the reasons why Bhavaviveka rejects the idea that meat eating is necessarily bad karma. The meat on your plate, from his perspective, is inert.

It is hard to prove this karmic debt exists, through it is a popular idea.
I have come across the source text again that makes this statement on creating relationships with animals by using their by-products. It is in the Śūraṅgama Sūtra on the Four Clear and Decisive Instructions on Purity - killing.
"Bhikshus who do not wear silk, leather boots, furs, or down, whether imported or found locally, and who do not consume milk, cream, or butter, can truly transcend this world. When they have paid back their past debts, they will not have to re-enter the Triple Realm. Why not? When someone wears anything taken from a living creature, he creates relationships with the creature, just as when people ate the hundred grains, their feet could not leave the earth. Both physically and mentally one must avoid the bodies and the by-products of beings, by neither wearing them nor eating them. I say that such people have true liberation. What I have said here is the Buddhas' teaching. Any explanation counter to it is the teaching of Papiyan(demon king)."

Yes but according to every level of buddhism, you need to have something called the divya caksus to have PERSONAL EXPERIENCE with rebirth.

Huseng said:
Not necessarily. With sufficient mastery of dhyāna one will recollect past lives.


Enochian said:
The divya caksus IS used from within dhyāna, the fourth dhyāna to be exact.

My whole point is though is that one cannot have PERSONAL EXPERIENCE with rebirth unless one has these abilities.

Is this true? -
In Buddhism the concept of liberation is Nirvana. It is referred to as "the highest happiness" and is the goal of the Theravada-Buddhist path, while in the Mahayana it is seen as a secondary effect of becoming a fully enlightened Buddha (Samyaksambuddha).

There are two obscurations, the afflictive obscuration caused by the three poisons, and the knowledge obscuration. To attain the result that is the desiderate of Theravada, one must only remove the first. From a Mahāyāna perspective, one must remove both completely in order to become a Buddha.

But in both cases, it is necessary to cease having rebirth in samsara.

The point is that Buddha not only taught rebirth, but he defined the four types of awakened people [stream entrants, once returners, never returners and arhats] by how many rebirths they had remaining before they would achieve nirvana.

It is true that he did not equate worldly happiness with belief in rebirth, since there were plenty of people in India during his day who also did not believe in rebirth. That is why he taught the brahmaviharas to lay people. The practice of them guarantees mental happiness whether one should accept rebirth or not.

But that is not Buddhism. Buddhism is predicated on the goal of ending rebirth in samsara through the eradication of the three poisons, desire, hatred and confusion, which arise because of ignorance.

Serenity509 said:
There is no question that many Buddhists, East and West, continue to believe in individual reincarnation. Parables from the sutras and "teaching aids" like the Tibetan Wheel of Life tend to reinforce this belief.

The Rev. Takashi Tsuji, a Jodo Shinshu priest, wrote about belief in reincarnation:

"It is said that the Buddha left 84,000 teachings; the symbolic figure represents the diverse backgrounds characteristics, tastes, etc. of the people. The Buddha taught according to the mental and spiritual capacity of each individual. For the simple village folks living during the time of the Buddha, the doctrine of reincarnation was a powerful moral lesson. Fear of birth into the animal world must have frightened many people from acting like animals in this life. If we take this teaching literally today we are confused because we cannot understand it rationally.

"...A parable, when taken literally, does not make sense to the modern mind. Therefore we must learn to differentiate the parables and myths from actuality."

What's the Point?

People often turn to religion for doctrines that provide simple answers to difficult questions. Buddhism doesn't work that way. Merely believing in some doctrine about reincarnation or rebirth has no purpose. Buddhism is a practice that enables experiencing illusion as illusion and reality as reality.

As for your first question: all Buddhas share the same realization. In this sense they "share" the same mind. The wisdom of a Buddha is free from being one or many. Since the dharmakāya is free from all extremes, it does not make sense to assert that Buddhas have differentiated mind streams. Their omniscience is identical because, to put it into relative terms, their minds and the object of their realization, emptiness free from extremes, have merged since Buddhas are in a constant state of equipoise on reality.

In terms of Madhyamaka, Buddhas and sentient beings are the same in so far as neither are ultimately established. Conventionally speaking, however, sentient beings have not abandoned everything to be abandoned and realized everything to be realized, but Buddhas have. That constitutes the difference between buddhas and sentient beings.

If you don't mind switching to Dudjom Tersar, consider Lama Pema Dorje in Oakland, CA or His brother, Lama Dawa, in Lansing, Iowa (see http://www.saraswatibhawan.org " onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;).

Bhaka Tulku is not personally teaching anymore (or so I've heard), but He has a couple of Tibetan disciples teaching in the SoCal area. Another good Nyingma Lama (Longchen Nyingthig & Dudjom Tersar) is Khenpo Sonam in Santa Monica, CA. If being a gringo is no problemo, there's Tulku Sherab Dorje in upstate NY (the Catskills) and Lama Rangbar who's soon moving to nearby Poughkipsie (spelling?). Of course, Tulku Sang-ngak is excellent. He lives in Santa Fe, NM. However, he's out of the country approximately half of each year (or at least he has been the last couple-few years).

Just a few Lamas who come to mind Who live in the U.S. and are very accessible to Their students on an on-going basis.

Good luck and best wishes.

There is no idea of a balanced personality, per se, apart from a person in good health whose dhātus (vatta, pitta, kapha) are well balanced.

However, all people are egoistic, since we all have our self-interest at heart, and atma-graha and bdag 'dzin can easily be translated as "egoism". Egotism, is mostly what Buddhist texts means by "pride".

Thanks for the replies. I'm sorry the words "Dharma clothes" seemed wrong to some. I usually reserve the word "robes" for monks' and nuns' robes and I was thinking of the shamgyur and zens worn at many Nyingma centers in the U.S. and abroad by non-monastic practitioners. I was just curious to see what people's ideas about these are. Like everything else, there are a variety of opinions.

Tibetans tend to think their costumes give them some juice. For example, you can read in some terma cycles that you should never be naked -- with elaborate and necessary clothing described. Yet when you read Indian cycles, you are supposed to give tormas naked. Then you have guys like Tsnang Nyon who like to dress in blood and entrails.

If you have trouble with rlung/vatta, one of the best treatments you can have is massage, especially ayurvedic massage with the proper oil. Also your diet should have a moderate amount of lamb, you should regularly take small quantity of ghee, avoid all caffeine, etc. Follow a diet and behavior for vatta person.
I have some serious lung problems, with my body feeling tight and unpleasently quick and jumpy a lot of the time. A neurologist I don't particularly have a lot of confidence in thinks I may have a minor genetic startle reaction disorder. I think it's more like the after effects of problems I had with anxiety in the past that have imprinted themselves on my nervous system. I don't feel emotionally unwell at all - by which I mean unhappy or over-stressed. Will the medication I have work on this?

I will certainly look at your diet/massage recommendation.

In my experience, every Dharma Center with Tibetan roots has a different position on this issue.  Some Nyingma centers practically require all participants to wear them during some rituals.  Some only allow Lamas, monks, and nuns, to wear them.  Some are more flexible.

In my center, monks wear Shamtab, Zen, etc.  all the time.  Lamas usually wear Shamtab, or a Shamgyur (wrap-around skirt-type thing) and zens....striped zens for Western three year retreat graduates, solids otherwise...though Tibetan Lamas usually wear solids.  Some of us wear Shamgyurs, etc., during Druppas or retreats, but may not always.

The rest is all based on custom.

Apart from this however, are articles of samaya connected with empowerments that one may be asked to maintain. These are also not "dharma clothes".

Huseng said:
Is this why Buddhahood is said to be immediately possible in a lifetime in tantra? By virtue of the emptiness realization being more profound and rapid than in sūtra? How does the accumulation of merit factor into this? Tantric methods produce more merit?

Malcolm wrote:
Tantric methods produce more merit, more rapidly using special methods such as mandala offerings. Typically, the merit and wisdom accumulation sections of any anuttarayoga tantra sadhana are theoretically capable of producing the equivalent of three incalculable eons worth of the two accumulations in a single session. Your individual milage may vary.

Huseng said:
Monastics are prohibited from sexual intercourse, but is the visualization of the activity equally as efficacious as the physical act? I understand Je Tsong Khapa decided to forego the act of coupling out of concern for disciples and achieved his liberation in bardo.

Malcolm wrote:
There is very little agreement on this issue among Tibetan lineages. There is also considerable disagreement about this issue in Indian sources. So this is a difficult point. Some masters assert that a monastic may use a consort having achieved the path of seeing. Other masters assert that it is fine for them to use a consort upon attaining patience on the path of application.

However, auto-erotic techniques may also be applied in absence of a consort. This is the usual mode of practice for single practitioners and monastics. For example, Vajraghantapada (a bhikṣu) asserts, in connection with the practice of Cakrasamvara, that while sexual misconduct is not a practice recommended in the tantras (because you must protect the bodies of others, etc.), non-celibate conduct (abrahmacarya) is.

Jeff's (Jnana) posts on this subject exhibit a specifically Gampopa/Kagyu POV on this issue.

In general, the Sakya school and Nyingma schools place much more importance on erotic practices than do the Kagyus. However, in the Nyingma school they are not generally considered indispensable for awakening in this lifetime. In most of the Tantric lineages within Sakya, they are considered indispensable for awakening in this lifetime. The exception to this would be the oral instructions of Naropa's Khechari -- where a type of pranāyāma practice is said to result in a state of bliss equivalent to the bliss of sexual congress and therefore obviates the need for a consort (also partially accounting, I feel, for the reason the Naropa Khechari instructions have attained the popularity they have). Thus, there can be differences between specific oral instruction lineages as well. This is why the instruction of a properly qualified guru is key on this point -- since there are so many lineages, and differences in practices even of the same deity in different instruction lineages.

The Kagyus and Gelugs have skeptical attitudes towards erotic practice grounded in Kadampa opinions. However, of the latter two, the Gelugs also generally maintain that erotic practices are indispensable for awakening in this lifetime.

Is the amount of merit a practitioner has from past lives taken into account when it is said that Buddhahood is possible in one life using tantric methods?

As Nāgārjuna explained the realization of ultimate truth is based on the foundation of conventional truth. I'm trying to understand why a non-conceptual samadhi would be better suited to realizing emptiness than conventional dhyāna.

Malcolm wrote:

We are not asserting that the ordinary bliss of an average couple's intercourse could ever lead to the realization of emptiness more rapidly than dhyana. However, when connected with the method, it does.

This does not contradict Nāgārjunas intent, since the experience of non-conceptuality is relative, and that relative experience is being used to point towards the ultimate.

"The hallmark of the intelligent design movement, however, is that it purports to rise above the level of personal skepticism. It claims to have found a reason why evolution could not have produced a structure like the bacterial flagellum, a reason based on sound, solid scientific evidence.

Why does the intelligent design movement regard the flagellum as unevolvable? Because it is said to possesses a quality known as "irreducible complexity." Irreducibly complex structures, we are told, could not have been produced by evolution, or, for that matter, by any natural process. They do exist, however, and therefore they must have been produced by something. That something could only be an outside intelligent agency operating beyond the laws of nature – an intelligent designer. That, simply stated, is the core of the new argument from design, and the intellectual basis of the intelligent design movement.

The great irony of the flagellum's increasing acceptance as an icon of anti-evolution is that fact that research had demolished its status as an example of irreducible complexity almost at the very moment it was first proclaimed. The purpose of this article is to explore the arguments by which the flagellum's notoriety has been achieved, and to review the research developments that have now undermined they very foundations of those arguments.

...

This, however, is not what is meant by "intelligent design" in the parlance of the new anti-evolutionists. Their views demand not a universe in which the beauty and harmony of natural law has brought a world of vibrant and fruitful life into existence, but rather a universe in which the emergence and evolution of life is made expressly impossible by the very same rules. Their view requires that the source of each and every novelty of life was the direct and active involvement of an outside designer whose work violated the very laws of nature he had fashioned. The world of intelligent design is not the bright and innovative world of life that we have come to know through science. Rather, it is a brittle and unchanging landscape, frozen in form and unable to adapt except at the whims of its designer.

...

Against such a backdrop, the struggles of the intelligent design movement are best understood as clamorous and disappointing double failures – rejected by science because they do not fit the facts, and having failed religion because they think too little of God."

Well, basically Meyers is a fellow of the Discover Institute. They have an ideological agenda which is contra evolutionary biology. They are about as anti-scientific as one can get. He is absolutely intent on proving that God created life. He wrote in 1999:

Physics and cosmology suggest intelligent design as a highly plausible and arguably best explanation for the exquisite fine-tuning of the physical laws and constants of the universe and the precise configuration of its initial conditions. Since the fine-tuning and initial conditions date from the very origin of the universe itself, this evidence suggests the need for an intelligent as well as a transcendent Cause for the origin of the universe. Since God as conceived by Christians and other theists possesses precisely these attributes, His creative action can adequately explain the origin of the cosmological singularity and the anthropic fine-tuning. Since naturalism denies a transcendent and pre-existent intelligent cause, it follows that theism provides a better explanation than naturalism for these two evidences taken jointly. Since pantheism, with its belief in an immanent and impersonal god, also denies the existence of a transcendent and pre-existent intelligence, it too lacks causal adequacy as an explanation for these evidences. Indeed, a completely impersonal intelligence is almost a contradiction in terms. Thus, theism stands as the best explanation of the three major worldviews theism, pantheism, and naturalism for the origin of the Big Bang singularity and anthropic fine-tuning taken jointly.

Face it, Will -- this is his strategy:

a) Try to get intelligent design accepted as a plausible and "scientific" explanation for the origin of life, alongside Darwin's natural selection
b) Having done so, then it is a short step to getting theism accepted as the best inferable explanation for intelligent design
c) Introduce creationism into the schools via the backdoor of ID.

His book has been well cleansed on his theistic predilections. But his agenda is perfectly clear, he is anti-evolution, anti-science. He studied the philosophy of science in order undermine one scientific theory, as far as I can tell, Darwin's theory of natural selection.

Furthermore, the Discover Institute promotes that most un-Buddhsit idea: "human exceptionalism" the idea that human beings are "exceptional" among living creatures and morally superior to all, etc.

themselves, they are still indicative of the level of
argumentation in the book, as well as of the quality
of its peer review. For example, it was in chapter
three that I first arrived at what I now call a “Behe
moment” when reading antievolutionary literature.
In Michael Behe’s book Edge of Evolution, he makes
a few obvious “rookie errors” when discussing how
probabilities work in population genetics.34 This,
for me, was the clear signal that the book was written
by an amateur in the field and not adequately peer
reviewed. In Signature, this moment arrived when
Meyer calls Pnemonococci a bacterium and a virus
in the same paragraph.35 This impression was confirmed
anew when Meyer describes, over the course
of several pages, his epiphany that DNA bases do
not have bonds between them and thus cannot selforganize
into specified sequences. This “epiphany”
is something that biology majors learn (or at least,
should learn) in their introductory courses. This
theme continued apace in the figure describing translation.
36 Signature shows tRNAs aligning to the
mRNA in a 5' to 5' orientation, tRNAs with codon
instead of anticodon sequences, and several inappropriate
nucleotide pairings: all very basic mistakes.
In short, Signature clearly was not written or peer
reviewed by individuals with a working knowledge
of molecular biology.
Now, these issues in and of themselves would not
be a serious problem for Signature, if not for the fact
that the strength of Meyer’s argument rests entirely
on his assertion that he has made a thorough search
through all proposed mechanisms for generating
biological information through natural means and
found them lacking. Meyer is asking his audience to
trust him that his analysis is thorough and sound.
However, that Meyer’s understanding of molecular
biology appears to be at or below a first-year college
level should give even the most pro-ID reader pause
here. It means that Meyer, well intentioned though
he may be, is simply not equipped to grapple with
these issues beyond an introductory textbook level.
Nor has Meyer sought the advice of those who are
able to do so. And as we have seen, Meyer has made
neither a thorough search for the origin of biological
information by natural mechanisms, nor a fair
assessment of current origin-of-life research.
...

While popular-level books written by nonspecialists
can be very helpful to a lay audience if they are
carefully reviewed by experts and adhere to consensus
science, Signature is not such a book. Like Edge of
Evolution before it, Signature in the Cell represents
a layman’s attempt to overturn an entire field of
research based on a surface-level understanding (and,
at times, significant misunderstanding or ignorance)
of the relevant science, published in a form that by-
passes review by qualified peers, and that is mar-
keted directly to a nonspecialist audience. This is
not good science, nor science in any meaningful
sense. If ID is going to advance as an intellectual
framework, it simply must do better. I, for one,
would be fascinated by a scientifically plausible
design argument. It would demonstrate that some-
thing is fundamentally wrong with the interpreta-
tion of very wide swaths of data across numerous
disciplines. That would not be a scientific problem,
but rather a monumental scientific opportunity that
would reshape research for decades to come. Such
times are the occasions of scientific legend—careers
to be made, Nobel prizes to be won. Alas, Signature is
not that argument. I do recommend it for those who
follow the ID literature, for it represents the current
state-of- the-art in ID thought for an important area
of biology. However, for those of us waiting for the
science behind ID, it looks as if the wait goes on.

The potential to attain the three kayas is there "within" the minds, but the three kayas are certainly not inherently within the mind. We need to purify obscurations and develop our qualities (that we have the potential for, yes). But implying that it is all ready made within us and waiting for us to uncover it is simplistic, at least from the Vajrayana pov.

Malcolm wrote:
It depends on the Vajrayāna school to which one adheres. For example, the Sakya school teaches that all the qualities of the three kāyas are naturally present in sentient beings originally, and that this natural presence does not conflict with transformation.

As to the statement that the "sambhogakaya arises out of the dharmakaya"

Malcolm wrote:
That is exactly what the Sarvatathāgata-tattva samgraha states.

mudra said:
this is a bit problematic because in the buddha state the kayas (the rupakayas [nirmanakaya and sambhogakaya] and the dharmakayas [svabhavakaya and jnanadharma], plus in certain systems the vajrakaya) are actually inseparable.

Malcolm wrote:
They may be inseperable, but they do not necessarily all appear together at the same time. In any event, there is no fault in asserting that sambhogakāya arises from the dharmakāya -- there is a saying in Dzogchen -- at the time of the basis, all kāyas are the dharmakāya; at the time of the result, all kāyas are the nirmanakāya.

The three kāyas always exist on the basis of a sentient being's mind. If not, then the inseparability of samsara and nirvana would not be possible, and there would be no way for the three kāyas to manifest.

The 1002 buddhas are discussed in a specific mahayana sutra attributed to Shakyamuni. But this does not mean that all of reality is predetermined.

It just means that according to this sutra Buddha made a prediction about the 998 buddhas to follow him. The next one, Maitreya, is expected to appear when the life span of human beings again increases to the span of 8,000 years (after it decreases to an average of ten years, etc.).

Is that the correct reason? And so each of the coming 998 will only appear once all traces of Shakyamuni's initial turning of the wheel have disappeared?

The innate ignorance is not a "stain" per say. It is not an afflictive ignorance, it is a simple absence of knowing.

Basically, at the point the basis arises from the basis, there is a neutral awareness present in the basis. That neutral awareness has no self-knowledge until the basis arises. While it is not aware of itself, it is in a state of non-afflictive ignorance.

When it apprehends the five lights, it apprehends them either as its own display, resulting in nirvana, Samantabhadra, etc., or it does not, resulting in samsara. The Tantra That Uproots Delusion:

Knowing the energy of the svābhavakāya

Gelugpas have one related to Vajrabhairava as well as Naropa's system. Then there is a specific tradition of Trulkhor associated with Kalacakra. Then there is Trulkhor associated with Shangpa Kagyu, I would imagine. They are all a little different, but have the same basic principle in mind i.e. freeing up knots and kinks of the body and removing disease.

I'm not sure what to make of modern views against using mercury fillings, mercury is obviously toxic but really does anything close to an effective amount get released into the body, or is just having the filling in the mouth going to cause problems?

The clearest advice I've had against metal in the mouth has been with implants and posts as these go into the body more and disrupt chi flow from a TCM perspective.

How does karma bring the first beings into appearance - do tiny wind wheels spin and presto Adi Buddha & Adi Gandharva & Adi fill-in-the-blank pop up?

At least give me an English source to read that describes this process of appearence of beings - not cosmology, I have such already.

Malcolm wrote:
There are no first beings.

Please read the third chapter of the Kosha where the collapse and formation of the universes is described.

Basically, what happens is that at the end of the last eon, all sentient beings are reborn in the upper two form realms while the rest of the container universe is destroyed. There is a period of twenty dark eons, and then due to the traces of action the wind mandala forms again, and and after the container universe forms due to the traces of karma of sentient beings, a being is born from the upper two form realms into the brahma loka. He looks around, and being unable to remember the loka from which he took rebirth, and being unable to perceive it, thinks he is both self-created, created the whole shebang, and manages to convince everyone else who is reborn afterwards that he did create it all.

The point, Will, is that dependent origination does not permit there ever to be a first anything.

Adibuddha simply refers to the first Buddha of a given eon i.e. the Sambhogakāya. It does not mean some creator buddha, as you know.

It doesn't. It just allows us to collapse into intellectual stupor and relief.

I am betting Will might be a freemason, though, and while masonry is supposedly open to all of any faith (upon invitation, of course), one of the principle requirements is belief in a GAU, a Grand Architect of the Universe. Since Buddhism does not accept a GAU, Buddhists would be technically excluded from masonry on principle.

It is not a work about evolution, but just focuses on the arising of life via the first cell.  Also impressive is his unbiased, close examination of the evidence against ID. He is not a preacher for ID who ignores evidence against it in favor of a pre-conceived notion.

I think Shingon, which is yoga-tantra, would be found appealing to many people outside of Japan if it were actively translated and taught outside of Japan. It isn't anuttarayoga-tantra (I don't think it was even developed in India at the time Shingon was being transmitted to Japan from China), but the model presents a path to Buddahood in a single lifetime. It is a model of tantra without Bon elements like in Tibet, though the Chinese influences are clearly present.

Malcolm wrote:
There are no Bon elements in Buddhist tantra in Tibet. There are a few rites, such as sang offerings, etc. that Tibetans use that ultimately derive from bon, but that are not "tantric". Many local deities were absorbed as protectors,however this phenomena is common in all Buddhist countries and is not unique to Tibetan Buddhism.

Yoga tantra requires a kind of ritual specialization for regular practice not needed in Anuttarayoga tantra. This is the main reason why it declined in Tibet. Yoga Tantra is more external.

On the other hand, there is also a growing interest in Anuttarayoga tantra and so on in Japan too.

Perhaps they did not succeed, because the Vedas are not Dzogchen. But when you look at the Gayatri mantra and it's inner and secret meanings, one could get the impression that there is a direct connection between the sun, the mantras and the mind. In any event the people who transmitted the Vedas were from Rishikas/Kambhojas aka Olmo Lungring.

According Bon sources, did Bon originated in Tazhik a Persian like area. That is the outer area or seen area from Olmo Lungring.
People out of these outer areas are still called today Tazhiks. 
Rishikas, where is that situated? Or do you mean Rishkesh the city of the Rishis or seers meant in the Vedic culture? Maybe are these Rishis connected to the Dzogchen cycle of teachings of Prahevajra, that could be, but according Bon we are not informed about a connection with the Rishis.

Rishikas and Kambhojas is the area of what is now called Tazik-Uzbek. Tazik-Uzbek was called Rishikas/Kambhojas maybe 3000-5000 years ago. It was not a Persian like area then. It was proto-Vedic and Proto-Persian. If we are talking 18,000 years ago like the Zhang Zhung texts indicate, we are talking about Rishikas and Kambhojas. These names are mentioned in the Mahabharata describing the peoples from this area who settled in Punjab and what is today Pakistan (where Udyana was). This group transmitted the Vedas. According to the Mahabharata the Maharishis responsible for discovering the Vedas were from Rishikas (land of the Rishis) and Kambhojas.

Incidentally there is a township in Tazik known as Almalyk which sounds like Olmo Lungring. Strangely it is one of the most polluted places on Earth.

For example, they might say "here is a table but it doesn't have any real existence" and then try to talk themselves into the idea that somehow the table isn't there.

Malcolm wrote:
Notions of 'is' and 'is not' lead us swiftly away from dependent origination. That is why Buddha and Nagarjuna criticized them.



PadmaVonSamba said:
If they approach the situation a little differently, saying, "there is nothing inherently there which can be (in essence) found to be a table" then the idea that we merely but labels on composite phenomena makes more sense, and the question of "is" or "is not" becomes moot, because, beginning with that understanding, no presumption of an object has been made.

Malcolm wrote:
Differentiating essences and existences is no different than trying differentiate things and their characteristics.

There is no table in a a table. Some people are helped with the idea there is no inherent table on a table, but then what often happens, is that they get hung up on the table, just the same.

Relatively speaking, every instant is impermanent, even though the 'chain' of instants has no beginning. The point of dependent origination is that no conditioned entity can arise from anything other than another conditioned entity. All causes are themselves effects, and all effects are themselves causes. There is no room in the logic of dependent origination for a cause that is not an effect of some other cause -- hence there can be no beginnings of any kind at all.

A view is a fundamental belief one holds about reality. For example, "everything exists" (sarva asti)

cloudburst said:
How can we know when something is presented as a view and when something is being presented as conventional discourse?

Malcolm wrote:
One can easily observe that common people, not educated in tenets, generally believe their statements about the existence and non-existence of things. When a pot is broken, for them it is not a pot anymore. It may have become a broken pot, or shards, but for them the pot that was there is no longer there and has thus become non-existent in their mind.

Likewise, they believe in simple reality of a pot that they can see. For them the pot "is".

When it comes to people trained in tenet systems, this question is easier, because of of course, those who subscribe to various Buddhist and non-Buddhist tenet systems subscribe to various sets of beliefs such as those who assert arising from an existent, those who assert arising from a non-existent and so on.

The Buddhas and Nagarjuna's target at based was really more oriented at the sort of naive realism that people have, especially in regards to rebirth. Naively, some people believe that they exist, and that they will continue to exist after death. Other people, on the other hand, think that after death, they will not exist anymore.

The root of both these mistaken positions is "is" and "is not" -- for example "I exist now, and I will continue to exist after death" or "I exist now but when I die I will cease to exist".

We can assume then, based on people's statements and training whether they are naive realists or not, or are trained in some tenet system.

Yes, this is true. This is based on many arguments you will find in Moonbeams of Mahamudra, for example.

However, the lineage of these kinds of practices are still quite active in Sakya and Nyingma; and presumably, Gelug and Jonang.

Kunzang Dechen Lingpa emphasized that these practices were really quite important. In Nyinthig, the preliminary practice of cultivating bliss in the trio of bliss, clarity and non-conceptuality is consort practice, and Longchenpa devotes an entire text to it alone in Lama Yangthig.

In the system of Ghantapada's five stages, first you work with a samayamudra (a visualized consort), then eventually you work with a karmamudra in the third, fourth and fifth stages.

What has happened in Tibet is that the three gsar ma schools have each taken a monolithic approach to the raw material of the writings and teachings of the Indian siddhas and masters. These monolithic approaches ride roughshod over the intricate details and variety found in Indian Buddhist siddha praxis. Also, the dim view that Tibetan kings took of mother tantra, and the practices of "union" and "liberation", etc., really affected the way the Kadampas interpreted the Dharma.

As far as Gampopa was concerned, he is really more into tattva than mahāmudra and so on, following the treatises of Maitripa. His nephew, Gomsthul asked:

"In terms of the view, what is common and what is superior?"

Gampopa replies:

"In common with cittamatra, everything is gathered into the mind. Cittamatrins however assert the mind as ultimate. Since the essence is that mind does not arise, [our view] is superior. Free from proliferation is common with Madhyamaka, [our view] is superior because of wisdom. The great vehicle of mantra does not assert aspects as true in common with the path of liberation; the mother tantra practitioners  meditate making bliss into the object. The practitioners of the great perfection meditates through making emptiness into an object. The practitioners of mahāmudra meditate through making equanimity into an object. Those are mental fabrications. 

Since reality (the essence that is not fabricated with the mind) is meditated, the essence is superior. 

The parts in common can be seen for yourself. If you understand what that practice has in common, the blessings are great."

So he taught them shamatha and vipashyāna in terms of mahāmudra view. But I have also ready passages in Gampopa's works where he criticizes mahāmudra as well.


adinatha said:
Basically, you didn't explain blessings. There's something more, related to interdependence and association with realized beings, elimination of doubt, etc., along with methods that allows one to realize the innate faster.

I felt I explained it adequately. There is nothing more than meeting one's guru, time etc., and one's karmic readiness for the teachings. What more could you need?

Everything else has to do with Guru Yoga, which I already mentioned above (according to the Guhyasamaja system). Guru Yoga is the practice for the best student that bypasses the need for the two stages and working with channels and cakras. People think that there is only a devotional aspect to Guru Yoga, but that is not true. Guru Yoga works directly with the anahatabindu in the heart and can directly cause the winds and so on to withdraw into the central channel.

There are two paths to realizing mahāmudra, the path of the two stage, or the path of guruyoga. Otherwise, there is no other path for realizing mahāmudra.

This is also the case in Sakya. Sachen says:

As such, if one understands the dharmadhātu,
spiritual practice possessing characteristics is not possible;
if one also meditates the creation stage with that [understanding],
[the creation stage] is spiritual practice without characteristics.

All masters will tell you that the reality of Mahamudra and Dzogchen are identical. What is the difference between Mahamudra without a base of tantra and Dzogchen?

Namdrol said:
Method: mahamudra without tantra is just perfection of wisdom.

Method, ultimately, is the most important difference between sutra and tantra.

If you argue that the difference between mahāmudra and perfection of wisdom is guruyoga, I will just respond that guruyoga is a unique method of Annutarayoga tantra.

So it all boils down to method. Likewise, the difference between Dzogchen and Mahamudra is method. There are also differences in the way the basis is explained and so on, but mostly, the difference is in method. If you are not using Dzogchen methods, you are not practicing Dzogchen. For example, in Kalacakra one works with visions, but it is not the same as thogal, as Dudjom Rinpoche clearly points out in his book.

Okay. Thank you for your continued patience and time. How do you explain blessings? They are just method? You've cited dohas which say the innate cannot be taught. The Kagyu teach that the innate can be discovered through blessings.

Malcolm wrote:
The Hevajra Tantra explains it very nicely:

Here there is no method and wisdom,
the appearance of true reality,
can’t be described by another, the innate
cannot be found anywhere,
but one can understand it in dependence on the Guru, 
time and method, and from one’s merit.

For example, Dombhi Heruka divides the innate into three aspects: cause, method and result.

The cause innate is the nature of the mind.

The method innate is fifteen innate dharmas:

...the innate three ṇāḍīs in the body, innate trio of exhalation, inhalation and abiding of the breath; and the innate as the three poisonous afflictions of the mind6; nine dharmas. In those innates, there is the inner obstacles, the innate three combined diseases; the outer obstacles the innate three demons. 
Now then, the diseases are one, vata; pitta and blood both are counted as one; and kapha are three. The three demons are male class, female class, and nāgā. 
Now fifteen dharmas exist from the beginning of the body’s development, and therefore are the fifteen innate dharmas.

The three innate experiences of bliss, clarity and non-conceptuality arise on the basis of these fifteen dharmas.

And the result innate is the three doors of liberation i.e. "Because the samadhis of the trio of pleasure, clarity and non-conceptuality occur, the three ṇāḍīs and the three vāyus are brought under control; one is liberated from the illnesses and the three types of spirits, and one actualizes the three doors of liberation."

Often people have a very restrictive concept of what "sahaja" means. Also the channels in your body are sahaja, the fact that you have one face and two arms is "sahaja" -- that is why two armed, one faced forms of Cakrasamvara and so on are called "sahaja" i.e. natural. In sahaja practice, unlike lower tantra and sutra, we do not reject anything.

Also, for example, the third Karmapa's commentary on Sahaja Mahamudra remarks that Sahaja Mahamudra is practiced in conjunction with Naro Chödruk.

Etc.

Finally, people have a funny idea for example that Tilopa hitting Naropa on the head was the end of Naropa's path. They don't realize that that was the beginning and it was only after that that Tilopa gave Naropa empowerments, practices connected with the channels and so on.

Hi,

I had been reading Adi Shankara's refutation of the various Buddhist Theories.

I want to know, if there are any Buddhist Texts which directly refutes Advaita (as propounded by Adi Shankara).

Thanks

Not directly.

Does that mean, the Buddhists of Shankara's time didn't attempt to hit back at Advaita directly :-/ ? while the Advaitin-s were aiming directly at the Buddhists !!

The Tarkajvala contains a general refutation and complaint about Advaita (basically saying, the Buddha asserted non-arising first, so why aren't you guys Buddhists) declaring that it was in the end very hard to distinguish Advaita from Madhyamaka.

Shantarakshita's Tattvasamgragha contains a rebuttal of the Advaita notion of permanent citta.
