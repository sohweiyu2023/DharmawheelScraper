Where did you get the idea that materialists only accept direct perception? Inference and trusted testimony are incredibly important for so-called materialists. It's just that inference needs to be backed up with evidence or eventually be testable. Scientific enquiry thrives on inference.

The rejection of inference and testimony has a rich history in materialism, starting with the Carvakas.

We are at the same place today, since the special instrumentality of yogically sharpened senses are not falsifiable according to empirical standards of ordinary perception. Therefore, all the wisdom and knowledge of our tradition is just so much superstition according to modern science.

No, it's not a slippery slope at all.

A lineage holder does not have the same authority, for example, as a Vimalakirti, and so on.

These different types of teachings as Buddhavacana are well established. For example, we have suttas in the Pali canon taught by Śariputra or Dhammadinna, wholly on Buddha's permission.

Of course, we are merely talking about _sutras_, of which there are a finite number. When it comes to tantras, well, that is a whole 'nother game.

You can negate literal rebirth both conventionally and ultimately. When I say literal rebirth I am talking about an individual's disembodied consciousness both experiencing the bardo, and their individual karmic imprints during the bardo, and then descending into the womb during conception. This is reasonably easy to negate both conventionally and ultimately.

What do you mean by "an individual's disembodied consciousness"? If you mean Sati's heresy, i.e, that an integral unit of consciousness takes rebirth, then yes, that it just a atman theory.

Also, I don't think people have really come to terms with what it is that is "reborn." Unless practitioners can come to some understanding of the nature of the knowing quality of the mind, the notion of rebirth will always be problematic.

There is Dharma, then there is Buddhadharma. Buddhadharma is superior to other Dharmas (so we believe) because it liberates from samsara.

Certainly even bodhisattvas on the paths and stages still experience suffering since, they possess the twin obscurations on the lower bhumis. Granted, Bodhisattvas on the pure stages do not experience suffering, but then they have conquered death.

So, exactly in what way does Buddhadharma teach a way not to suffer in this life short of attaining some āryan realization?

But there is no guarantee in Buddhism that if you practice Dharma you will "suffer less in this life" -- especially considering the three kinds of suffering.

Whatever suffering you experience is the ripening of past actions not even the buddha's can prevent. The goal of Buddhist practice is to awaken and end the cycle of birth in samsara.

My objection is that people are constantly putting this forward as evidence of tangible fruits of Buddhist practice when they are not even Buddhist practices at all per se, and do not, in any way whatsoever address the issue of suffering.

But this is why i picked that specific sutra for in it the retinue specifically requests the Buddha to call Manjushri so that they might see him. Buddha does nothing more than call Manjushri to join them, and refuses to ask or command Manjushri to teach. And then they ask to hear him not recount the teachings of Shakyamuni but rather those of Ratnaketu: Then the divine son Lord of Peace and Calm bowed to the Blessed One and said, with joined palms, “Blessed One, all of us would like to listen, so please ask Mañjuśrī Kumārabhuta to teach.”
The Blessed One replied, “Divine son, you yourself should make that request.”
So the divine son said, “Mañjuśrī, it would be wonderful if you could give us a Dharma teaching similar to what is taught in the buddha realm of the blessed one, the Thus-Gone Ratnaketu.”
And as pointed out above other sutras were composed or transcribed by others such as Huineng. So i, and it would appear others as well, find the wording of your poll question to be too vague.

Otherwise, you are quite right, there is a lens through which every one introduced to Buddhism in the West reads Buddhism and that lens was originally polished in the late 19th century.

They all adhere to the text critical method which is the consensus view of Buddhist textual evolution in the academy.

For example, our own dear and beloved Huifeng doesn't believe a single word of Mahāyāna was taught by the Buddha. Neither does Jeff aka Indrajala, and I dare say, neither do you. Forget about all these fancy rationals, dreams, visions, and so on. Basically, the simple fact is that most of us who follow Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna don't actually believe that the scriptures we purport to follow were indeed taught by the Buddha in any form at all.

On two occasions, I've been able to to see mid-19th century photographs of Tibetan Buddhist practitioners and some of their implements (one was on display years ago at the University of New Mexico, USA; the other at George Mason University, USA).  It seems to me that there have been some small but significant changes in the size and shape of some articles of practice, which seem to be increasingly standardized today.  For instance, the chodpas I've seen photographed in practice over a hundred years ago might have much smaller and differently-accoutred damaru than one might expect to see someone using today--or not.

I'm wondering if these changes reflect easier manufacturing processes today compared to pre-industrial Asia, or changes in attitude/expectation toward practice implements, or something else entirely--or if I'm completely off the reservation in my reading of these images.

It is not likely to happen. I have been reading academic Buddhist literature for the better part of three decades, I worked for a Buddhist book store at one time, and also Wisdom Pubs as their retail manager in 1990-1. I have maintained a familiarity with the latest and greatest of academic literature especially where it concerns Mahāyāna — when I tell you that it piles speculation on assumptions in absence of actual facts, I mean it. When I tell you that I have observed a number of interpretive fads amongst western scholars, I mean it. Even if there are closeted Buddhists in academia, they certainly cannot write books from the perspective of their faith. Instead, they must accommodate the western scholastic set of assumptions and prejudices about the history of Mahāyāna whether they buy them or not (but they largely seem to). The one thing it all boils down to is that according to the current state of knowledge of the origins of Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna, western scholars simply have no clear idea where these traditions are from and how they arose.

But we do. Why? Because we have clear accounts of the rise of these teachings; which teacher brought out which tantras (Nairatma, Hevajra; Saraha, Cakrasamvara, Garab Dorje, the Dzogchen Tantras, and so on). In general we consider that Nāgārjuna revealed Mahāyāna. And that is all a practitioner of these systems really needs to know.

Their approach does not lead to a living wisdom tradition that will never be obsolete. Their approach leads to dead knowledge in a book, soon obsolete.

Pretty much every suggestion of origin, or attempt to pin something down in Buddhist history is met with a chorus of confusion and counter claims.

I seriously considered becoming a Buddhologist, but after seeing how the work of people like Janet Gyatso, Hallisey, Van de Kuip, Germano, etc., turned out, and how destructive, or if you prefer, deconstructive the approach of the western academy towards Buddhadharma is, I have decided to eschew its conclusions as non-productive and sterile speculations.

Otherwise, if you actually have confidence in the teachings, you cannot really say why you do apart from your own conceptual admiration of them since you certainly cannot believe they come from an awakened source.

And in doing so opening up a new position which seemingly holds that there are two types of concepts/language - one in which the intractable gap is generated, and the other in which language/concepts is reality.

The tathāgatas fully attain the accomplishment of speech that is without center or periphery in order that all realms of sentient beings may understand it with a single tone

The gap between reality and language is a problem only for us. There is no such gap for Buddhas? Why? Because the Buddhas are free from concepts. So their acts of speech are similarly free from any conceptual restraint that would differentiate their content from describing reality just as it is.

From http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Tirthika

According to this definiton by Mipham Rinpoche Carvaka are tirthika: The tirthikas' views embody the gross, simplistic view of eternalism, considering that phenomena are not momentary and the simplistic view of nihilism, the belief that although phenomena are caused, they themselves do not generate their own effects—there are no past nor future lives—or that actions will not give rise to karmic results.

So either the translation is incorrect, or Mipham is mistaken.

Guru Rinpoche lists four types of non- buddhists phyal ba, rgyang 'phen pa (carvaka), mur thug pa, and mu stegs pa. The last, used for eternalists, is well known to translate the term "tīrthika" i.e. forders of the crossing, referring to their belief in rebirth.

But the Lotus Sutra of this world would certainly be taught by a different Buddhua, at a different, time, place and retinue. And since you said that the conditions does not have to be same, etc, then it is quite clear that the Hevajra in this world was taught after the 4 tenet schools have arisen, since that would be the appropriate condition for the tantra to actually mention the 4 schools. Hence we have internal evidence that the Hevajra was really taught later, via visions, illusory bodies, etc.p[./quote]

This is not evidence for that. One, it was taught to Virupa by a human women in person, the Nirmanakāya Nairatmya, not in a dream. Secondly, it was taught by the Buddha in the morning of his awakening when he conquered the four māras. Further, the longest version of it was taught eons ago by Mahāvajradhara.

Since Buddhas are indeed omniscient concerning the three times, there is also no contradiction that the Buddha could teach on the four tenets before they arose. And since the retinue the Buddha taught the Hevajra too on the morning of his awakening is not specified apart from Vajragarbha and the net of dākinīs, we can also assume they understood what the Buddha was teaching about in the two sectioned version of the Hevajra tantra.


Unknown said:
So there is no contradiction at all in the same sūtra or tantra being taught in a different manner, with different topics when taught to different people in different epochs.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course - proof that sutras don't have to be taught by the nirmanakaya Buddha, can be taught later, etc.
When a sūtra or tantra is taught to an ordinary human being, it needs to be taught by a Nirmanakāya, as we see from account of Virupa's awakening. Virupa was not yet even a first stage bodhisattva when he met Nairatmya, so he could not possibly have perceived her in any other form than the one she presents to him as a two armed, one faced human being.


Unknown said:
I am not saying that such persons reject the sutras and tantras are taught by the Buddha. Let me repeat myself again, since you are obviously deaf to this: the sutras and tantras are indeed taught by the Buddha, but the Buddha is not limited to his nirmanakaya form 2500 years ago in India.

Malcolm wrote:
Sure, but when a sutra says "When the Buddha was residing in Vaisali attended by Śariputra, etc." we are to understand it happened within the 80 year span of the Buddha and not in some vision.


Unknown said:
Because of his all-pervasiveness and supreme skillfulness, he can manifest in the mindstream of sentient beings teaching in various forms and methods, even after his rupakaya entered parinirvana. In this, I would say that my position on this is stronger than yours, since I am not constrained by historical facts.

Malcolm wrote:
But you are so constrained by the historical references to various places and events mentioned in many Mahāyāna sutras. I am specifically referring to sūtras that say things like "When the Bhagavan was residing at Vulture Peak or Vaisali, etc."

The second thing constraining you is that there is no Indian tradition at all which suggests what you suggest, i.e. that Mahāyāna sutras were produced piecemeal in visions by later yogins. This is just a modern rational invented by you latter-day Mahāyānists who have basically accepted the idea that Mahāyāna was not actually taught by the nirmanakāya Śakyamuni Buddha. Why do you use this rational? It is because you fundamentally accept the account of the appearance of Mahāyāna as it is presented by western scholars from the time of Max Müller onward.

But back to your question - it seems that personages such as Sonam Tsemo, Kongtrul, and other illuminaries can argue and disagree with each other on the finer points of the origin stories of sutra, but this never hindered them from high attainments.

Two points about this. 1. There's basically universal agreement that in any Buddhist tradition, language does not objectively reflect or refer to reality. Thus the problematic of language games runs deep through Buddhism, and often becomes a very central and prominent soteriological/philosophical issue. Surely you would not dispute this.
If this were really true, then how do you deal with acts of true speech? For example, in the Śatasāhasrikāprajñāpāramitābṛhaṭṭīkā we find:

"When an irreversible bodhisattva sees a city on fire, he says "May the fire be pacified". When the fire is pacified through the blessings of true words, you can know that one as being irreversible."

The only way to get outside of this is to either cease using language (which I suggested, and in some respects is a plausible yogic response) or to run with some alternative theory of language/meaning ala Panini, which would be very antithetical to any orthodox Buddhist view.

I think that thus far Western analysis of classical Buddhist attitudes towards language have ignored the role of satya-vacana.

He does. In the Yogini's Eye, he says: Some scholars say that the Mahayana Sutras were compiled in the southern region called Vimalasambhava in a gathering of 900 million bodhisattvas. However, this is in great error as [this gathering] never took place.

Malcolm wrote:
No, Verril has translated this passage incorrectly. I give the correct translation above, which is confirmed in another one of his works, which I also produced. "Yogini's Eye" is Verril's title for the General Presentation of The Divisions of Tantra. The passage is "...de'ang skyon chen po ni med do", "also a great error that is not", the error is asserting 90 million, rather than one. Here is my rendering again:

"When some masters say that the Mahāyāna sūtras were compiled after ninety million bodhisattvas gathered in the southern direction at Vimalasambhāva although there is no great fault in that position,

Further proof of my reading is that Sakya Pandita, Sonam Tsemo's nephew states in his Great History of Dharma:
"It is reputed that "One million bodhisattvas gathered at the southern royal palace, Vimalasambhava, where Mañjuśī compiled the sūtras, Vajrapani compiled Abhidharma, and Ajita Maitreya compiled the Vinaya in the language of Mahāyāna."

He then describes how statments in the sutras which describe both Vajrapani and Ānanda as the compiler of the teachings are not in contradiction. Later Buton, Rinchen Drup gives this account, then Kongtrul.

If Sapan thought it completely wrong, he would have rejected it outright — as we have plenty of examples of his doing so. Sonam Tsemo presents it in two different works which I produce above. The point is that this account is generally an accepted in Tibet from an early period.

And in his General Presentation of the Divisions of Tantra he says:
"When some masters say that the Mahāyāna sūtras were compiled after ninety million bodhisattvas gathered in the southern direction at Vimalasambhāva although there is no great fault in that position, but both Secret Mantra and the uncommon Mahāyāna were compiled by Vajrapāni. As it is explained in the Prajñāpāramitā Treatise Commentary by master Vasubandhu through Ārya Maitreya’s request to the bodhisattva Vajrapāni [55/b] “…this prajñāpāramitā heard by me is promised to the retinue.” Although one cannot reject compilation in different locations, it also cannot be proven."
In general, however, we can understand that Sonam Tsemo does not have your idea, which is that Mahāyāna was not actually taught by the Buddha at all.

Oh, so Nairatmya would alter the contents of the tantra to suit Virupa's understanding? This would make the whole origin stories irrelevant and unnecessary.

Malcolm wrote:
No, it does not make the origin stories irrelevant nor unnecessary. For example, when the Saddharmapundarika sutra was taught, the Buddha states that it was taught in the very distant past by a Buddha called Candrasūryapradīpa. But I don't think we need to assume that the words are identical in every respect, nor was the assembly the same, nor were the conditions the same, and so on. He adds:

Immeasurable buddhas in the present and future
Will also teach this Dharma
With various skillful means.

Indicating that the Saddharmapundarika sutra will be taught in the future by many Buddhas.

So there is no contradiction at all in the same sūtra or tantra being taught in a different manner, with different topics when taught to different people in different epochs.

For example, the main point of the Hevajra tantra is that it presents the method of realizing the continuum of Vajradhara in the form of Hevajra, not that it mentions the four tenet systems, as well as the four divisions of tantra.



Unknown said:
"the single vajra word is heard differently by beings of different capacities".

Malcolm wrote:
The meaning of the words can mean differently or have deeper layers to those of greater capacity, but the words would still be the same.
No, actually, that is the point. When citation this is taken from explains that one words is heard as different words by different people. It is called the "array of speech".


Many have advanced in their practice of tantra, even when they disagree with the varying origin stories of this sutra or that tantra.
Like who? Can you name even one modern person who has "advanced in their practice" even though they reject the sutras and tantras were actually taught by the Buddha?

Tradition claims that Shakyamuni taught Hevajra during his earthly time (to subdue the four maras), but in the subjugating chapter, he said that one should study the Vaibhasika, then Sautrantika, then Yogacara and then Madhyamaka. These schools didn't exist at all 2500 years ago, and would have made absolutely no sense to who ever was taught the tantra back then. This is just an example of the many anarchronisms that are all over the place, especially in the later Mahayana tracts.

Malcolm wrote:
The source of this idea comes from the Śrī-vajramālābhidhānamahāyogatantra-sarvatantrahṛdaya-rahasyavibhaṅga by Paṇḍita Alaṃkakalaśa. After listing the various deva realms and so on where each of the five classes of tantra were taught he states:

After that, for the purpose of subduing the four māras, the large great tantra of Śrī Hevajra and explanatory tantra of the short one were taught here in Magadha in this Jambudvipa.

This does not mean it was taught to an ordinary assembly, as we can see, since the this pandita clearly states the compilers of the tantras are either Vajrapani or Mañjuśri, and because the petitioner of the Hevajra is Vajragarbha, a tenth stage bodhisattva. At the time of the taming of the four Māras, there was no ordinary Sangha at all.

Further, there is no contradiction at all, since when this tantra was revealed to Mahasiddha Virupa by the nirmanakāya ḍākinī, Nairatmya, it was in a time and a place where the four tenet systems had arisen. It is not the case that sūtras and tantras are engraved on golden plates somewhere and that their words are somehow eternal. As has been pointed out to you already, "the single vajra word is heard differently by beings of different capacities".

Tantras like Cakrasamvara were never taught to a bhikṣu sangha nor by Śakyamuni, but only in the 24 places, where they are still taught by the Nirmanakāya in the form of Cakrasamvara, just as Guru Rinpoche, Śakyamuni's emanation, is still teaching the rakṣasas in Camara on Zangdog Palri.

Khepa: We are American Tantric Buddhists. We are not Tibetan Tantric Buddhists. So there was a long period where I decided I did not want any contact with any other teachings. I wanted to teach purely what was given to me through Terma and through vision. Now it‟s been eight years, and our community is very well established. So now I‟m entering a completely different phase where I‟m actually quite interested in meeting and talking with Ngakpa Chogyam, who‟s Scottish, but he teaches a very traditional Tibetan line of Dharma transmission.

One prong is that it's faddish and speculative.

You've also made it clear that it's this second concern which is the primary motivation for your new stance against scholarship. You used to find the scholarship worthy of consideration, and you even agreed with some of its findings, but now you reject it because you saw it has a pernicious undermining effect on belief in the validity of the Mahayana dharma.

So I am wondering what your response would be if somebody presented scholarship that was not speculative, but nevertheless weakened your conviction. Would you still reject it on those grounds? Or would you change your beliefs, for instance by abandoning Mahayana in favor of the sravaka path?

And along the same lines, if there are practitioners here who do not think the historical Buddha taught what is in the Mahayana sutras, would you advise them to become sravakas?

Malcolm wrote:

And the traces that it has created are very strong, and present obstacles to many people's practice.

The only honest thing they can say is this: X text appears in Chinese here, here and here; and in Tibetan here; and in some Central Asian fragments we think date to here. And that is all, nothing more.

Those are the empirical facts, the only "truth" they can muster.

I understand the fascination with mysteries and puzzles, but in reality, there is almost nothing of use in western historical Buddhist writing that is of any benefit to practicing Mahāyāna Buddhists.

Malcolm wrote:
Which sort of "valid" knowledge are we talking about? My point about western scholarship of the origins of Mahāyāna is that it is constructed on speculations and suppositions which amount to nothing more than the mess of prapañca we see illustrated in Sujato's review of the different theories of the origins of Mulsavastivada school shows.

For example, when you have such a mess of theories, where is the "valid" knowledge therein contained.

Schopen's work, for example, is interesting because he chooses to focus on material evidence of Buddhism in India. Fine, but when he starts speculating, as he does throughout his books, and saying things like "the Buddha is made to predict..." and so on, we have left the grounds of confirmed evidence and entered the realm of hypothesizing.

My point is that Buddhists are not going to learn more about Buddhism by reading the speculative fantasies by which Buddhologists and Tibetologists earn their meager salaries. They are merely going to fill their head with the prapañca of conflicting theories and intellectual fashions.

In the end, since the focus of text criticism is strictly forensic, once the autopsy is over, there is very little left of a corpse to bury.

In short, Buddhology is of no use to practitioners at all. It does not provide us with a solid sense of history; it does the opposite; it does not provide us with tradition, it does the opposite; it is not grounded in wisdom, but rather the rank conceptuality of ordinary people who are for the most part NOT practitioners and have no interest in transforming their lives with the Dharma. Further, I have seen more than one former practitioner travel down the road of Buddhology/Tibetology, etc., and completely lose their faith and interest in practice altogether. Why?

Here is a beautiful example of just what a useless waste of time Western writing on Buddhist history can become:

The uncertainty around this school has fuelled a number of hypotheses. Frauwallner’s theory is that the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya was the disciplinary code of an early Buddhist community based in Mathura, which was quite independent as a monastic community from the Sarvāstivādins of Kaśmir (although of course this does not mean that they were different in terms of doctrine). Lamotte, against Frauwallner, asserts that the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya was a late Kaśmīr compilation made to complete the Sarvāstivādin Vinaya.2 Warder suggests that the Mūlasarvāstivādins were a later development of the Sarvāstivāda, whose main innovations were literary, the compilation of the large Vinaya and the Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna Sūtra,3 which kept the early doctrines but brought the style up to date with contemporary literary tastes.4 Enomoto pulls the rug out from all these theories by asserting that Sarvāstivādin and Mūlasarvāstivādin are really the same. Meanwhile, Willemen, Dessein, and Cox have developed the theory that the Sautrantikas, a branch or tendency within the Sarvāstivādin group of schools, emerged in Gandhāra and Bactria around 200 ce. Although they were the earlier group, they temporarily lost ground to the Kaśmīr Vaibhāśika school due to the political influence of Kaṇiṣka. In later years the Sautrantikas became known as the Mūlasarvāstivādins and regained their earlier ascendancy.5 I have elsewhere given my reasons for disagreeing with the theories of Enomoto and Willemen et al.6 Neither Warder nor Lamotte give enough evidence to back up their theories.

Don't get me wrong here, of course this book is well written and has a lot of interesting information, but passages like the above clearly illustrate the absurdity of much of what has been written by "Buddhologists".

produces and increases all qualities,
removes fears and crosses rivers;
faith shows the way to the city of bliss…
But I would say that it is the my faith in the Buddha's teaching, even where I did not fully understand it, that allowed me to grow in my understanding of the Dharma.

So yes, sometimes I say I don't need faith, that means "blind faith".

But lack of faith is damaging to one's practice, since faith is defined as "clarity about an object". Lack of clarity about the teachings, lack of clarity about one's practice, all of this comes about from the "lack of clarity" we term "lack of faith".

These subtle traces cause obstacles in one's practice and life. Of course, if one is not a Mahāyāni, then there is no problem. But if one has taken bodhisattva vows, and so on, lack of complete confidence in the origin of Mahāyāna sutras is destructive to those vows.

No, this is not a warranted conclusion. In order to establish this, you would have be to able to say for certain whether this sūtra was taught after the Prajñāpāramita, but as there is absolutely no difference in the statement of the text concerning the content of the second and third turning, your contention cannot be verified at all.

For example, in the 25,000 PP, the Buddha replies to Subhuti's declaration that the Buddha had turned a second wheel of Dharma:
Subhuti, because of the essential non-existence of things, this is also not a second turning of the wheel, it is also not the first turning of the wheel.

pueraeternus said:
A bunch of arhats preserved the Sravaka canon much better, maintaining the transmission immediately after the parinirvana.

Contrast this with bodhisattvas, who are supposed to be vastly superior in every way, having the Mahayana canon in such piecemeal fashion and all over the place?

In fact, the whole "three turnings" thing is so unimportant to Indians, there is no a single Indian commentarial voice on the issue. There exists solely a Korean commentary and a Tibetan commentary in the bstan 'gyur that deals with the issue at all. As we have seen, the Korean commentary attempts to define a temporal sequence, the Tibetan commentary does not make any such attempt.

On the other hand, there are many voices which deal with Maitreya Bodhisattvas statement that Śrāvakayāna and Mahāyāna arose together.

I do not say that text criticism was immoral, what I said was that if one accepts the text critical version of Buddhist history and one is a Mahāyāni, then one necessarily accepts that the texts one is following are not authentic. That is an immoral position for a Mahāyānist to take.

This is obviously a problem for Indian Mahāyānists because they again and again voice the sentiment that Mahāyāna sūtras need to be accepted as historical Buddhavacana, i.e. that they come from the time with the Buddha had not passed into parinirvana.

I think it is simply more practical for practicing Mahāyānis to accept the classical Indian Mahāyāna position about the authorship of the sūtras. We then avoid all the complications of later and earlier sutras, blah, blah, blah.

pueraeternus said:
Maitreya can't have meant that the 2 vehicles was taught at the same time, because in the Samdhinirnocana, it is explicitly mentioned that the dharma wheel was turned 3 separate times - first at Benares the four noble truths, then the Buddha later turned it a second time proclaiming alaksanadharmacakra (Madhyamaka) for the Bodhisattvas, then finally because even the second turning was provisional, he turned the wheel the third time for the ultimate teaching (Yogacara). So you see, even the Buddha himself segregated the 3 sets of teachings into 3 distinct temporal periods.

Malcolm wrote:
While it is certainly true that many people have understood it this way, for example, the Korean master Wan tshig (sorry, did not dig up his actual Korean name): Indeed that Dharma of the Buddha is profound, nevertheless because there are many methods of guidance and ways of introducing it, not only one, the Sovereign of the Dharma taught three Dharma wheels. Among those the first the demonstration of cycling in the forests where wild animals roam who constantly perish and the causes and results of nirvana to those who are to enter into the Śrāvakayāna. This is called “The Dharmawheel of the four truths”. Second, is teaching the Ārya-prajñāpāramita to sixteen gatherings at Vulture Peak and so on to those who are to enter the Bodhisattvayāna. This is called the Dharmawheel of characteristiclessness. The third is the teaching of the Saṃdhinirmocana and so on to those in the pure buddhafields such as Padmagarbha, and the impure ones to those are to enter all vehicles called the “Mahāyāna of the definitive meaning”.
This is not completely certain. There is no record in any other sutra or commentary of where these sites may be. In any case, even if we accept Wan tshig's statement at face value, it still means that the Mahāyāna arose at the same time as the Śravakayāna because it was taught during the lifetime of the Buddha.

Moreover, there is no certain statement in the citation itself that this is the case. In his General Division of Tantras, Loppon Sonam Tsemo responds to the above assertion:
If it is true those three Dharmawheels were turned for different inclinations, to claim “…they were turned in stages in different countries’” is not reasonable. If it is asked how it is not reasonable, it is because scripture and reason are contradicted, the objections of the srāvakas will not be rejected, the Sugata will come under criticism and so on. Because there will be many such faults, it is not reasonable.
He ultimately answers this qualm with the citation from the Sutralaṃkara:
Not predicted earlier, arising at the same time.

As the Sandhivyākarana-tantra too states:

Non-conceptual, undisturbed,
...the pleasing single vajra word
becomes many different [words]
from the perspective of the mentalities of the trainees.

A single statement of the Bhagavan’s will appear as many different Dharmas to many different trainees at the same time. That also does not contradict the citation of the Samdhinirmocana-sūtra explained above. Although that citation does state different Dharmas, it does not state different locations or different times. Since that is so, teaching different Dharmas to trainees with one statement made at the same time is called “the array of speech,” and demonstrating many different bodies in different locations at the same time are the beneficial deeds with an array of bodies.

pueraeternus said:
Since logically if the these turnings were done during the Buddha's earthly time, then we would have seen the movements started during his lifetime.

Not necessarily, since the Mahāyāna was not collated by the Śravakas, but rather by the Mahābodhisattvas as indicated in such sūtras as the Tathāgatācintyaguhyanirdeśa.

Hello All,

Question about group practice:

If a number people were planning to get together and do chNNr's Green Tara practice and everyone but two people had received introductory transmission and the Green Tara lung from chNNr, but had done Tara pracices before from other teachers would it be okay for them to participate in a group practice setting and do chNNr's  Green Tara practice?

Both of these folks are intending on receiving transmission from chNNr eventually. I don't want to discourage them from coming to an event, but although it is a peaceful practice (obviously no action mantras during this gathering) It requires a lung so I am not sure what to do other than do another Tara practice that everyone has authorization for.

Thanks in advance for any advice,

What Maitreya is basically saying is that your insistence on accepting the literal historicity of the Mahayana sutras is not in fact necessary for the Mahayana to be valid.

Malcolm wrote:
No, that is not what he is saying. What he is saying is that whoever wins the result is a Buddha, and whatever he or she explains will be Buddhavacana. Municandra explains:
That being the case, the Mahāyāna is proven to be the word of the Buddha. If it is asked how, the person who comprehends the stages, the perfections and the meaning of no arising and cessation, that person is called "a buddha". Since all the words that person explains are the word of a buddha, Mahāyāna is proven to be the word of the Buddha.
This statement should not be taken as an argument for the ahistoricity of Mahāyāna, because that is not the intent. What it is in fact is a criteria for establishing the authority of the Guru. Maitreya first established that Mahāyāna is historical as I show above.

He also proves that without Mahāyāna there would be no Śravakayāna, since without the bodhisattva path there would be no Buddha. Municandra continues:
If there is no Mahāyāna, there will be no Śravakayāna. If it is asked why, if Mahāyāna does not exist, the path of accomplishing Buddhahood, the accomplishment of Buddhahood will not exist. If Buddhahood was not accomplished, then also since the Hīnayāna will not be explained, then this Hīnayāna that appears like that also will not be the word of the Buddha.
The eight points that Maitreya illustrates are to be take together as a whole argument, i.e. Mahāyāna is the word of the Buddha because 1) it was not predicted to be false 2) because it arose at the same time as the Śravakayāna 3) because it is outside the range of intellectuals and because it not perceived in texts of tīrthikas 4) because it is proven 5) because it exists 6) because it does not not-exist 7) because it is a remedy for the afflictions and 8) because the words are not to be taken literally (i.e. they require interpretation).

We have to accept the historicity of the Mahāyāna because we have the example of the Buddha! That is the whole point of these eight reasons.

(La Vallée Poussin, Pruden translation)

I find this a rather charming image, but I'm wondering if this is actually a good way to think about the skandhas. I would be happy to hear what the learned members of DW think.

The eight points brought up by Maitreya also covers this (in Vasu's bhasya):

enlightened being other (than Säkyamuni Buddha), that also proves it to be
buddha-word, since a buddha is anyone who becomes perfectly enlightened and
then teaches such (a vehicle)."

And how would Abhayakaragupta know what happened during the First Council? Why would non-tantrikas take his words as definitive?

Ananda was present in many of the major Mahayana sutras, as already quoted earlier - the prajnaparamitas, vimalakirtinirdesa, etc. How do you explain this?

Malcolm wrote:
Of course Ānanda was present during the teaching of many Mahāyāna sūtras, this is not under dispute.

The point is that Abhayakaragupta is making is that the first council was not a convention for collecting all the teachings of the Buddha. The point he is making is that the first council had an agenda that was limited in its scope.

As an Indian Buddhist, he had access to sources and traditions we do not have. Abhayakaragupta is as likely to know what actually happened during the first council as we are. And Abhayakaragupta's perspective is a confirmation of earlier opinions  voiced by those such as Maitreya and Bhavya.

We know a very great deal about what the Theravadins think about these issues. We know a very great deal about what western academics think about these issues. We know almost nothing about what Indian Mahāyānists think about these issues — but in general, Western Mahāyanists, including Tibetan Buddhists, tend to defer to the latter two groups when it comes to Mahāyāna history and ignore our own historical traditions. I think that is detrimental to Mahāyāna in general.

Mahāyāna proclaims five certainties: time, place, teacher, teaching and retinue, i.e. always; Akaniṣṭha; the Sambhogakāya; Mahāyāna;  Buddhas and bodhisattvas, both emanated and the continuums of others. By contrast, the Śravakayāna is limited in its scope in terms of time, place, teacher, teaching and retinue. Nevertheless, Mahāyāna taught by the nirmanakāya is a localized and temporal instantiation of those teachings, and there are good reasons why the Mahāyāna narratives of their spread ought not be ignored.

Not claiming anything of the kind. I am also not engaging in conspiracy theories or speculations. I am reporting what various Indian masters opine based upon the sūtras that they read.

For example, Sakya Paṇḍita, while not an Indian master, opines that there is no contradiction between Vajrapani and Ānanda being the compilers of the sūtras.

I will leave it for others to engage in speculations and theories about this issue. As for myself, I am content to regard Guhyapati Vajrapani as being the primary collator of the Buddha's sūtras and tantras, as that is the role to which the Buddha appointed him.

Thus, there are three main considerations we need to understand:

1) The Śravakayāna and Mahāyāna arose at the same time, per Maitreyanatha
2) The collators of the Mahāyāna were the major bodhisattvas, Mañjuśrī, Vajrapani and so on per Bhava and so on
3) The person who is represented by "Thus have I heard..." is Vajrapani per Abhayakaragupta

This is our Mahāyāna tradition.

The Vajrapani mentioned in the early Agamas is a yaksha...
As is Vajrapani in Mahāyāna sūtras. He is called "Guhyapati" because is he the master of the Guhyakas.

He is also seldom mentioned in most sutras and in the early Mahayana sutras, he is almost never there. Only in the much later phase of Mahayana does he appear with any regularity.
All these sutras mention him:

Śatasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā
Pañcaviṃśatisahasrika
̄Aṣṭasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā
Aṣṭadaśasahasrika-prajñāpāramitā
Daśasāhasrikā-prajñāpāramitā
Prajñāpāramitānayaśatapañcāśatikā
Pañcaviṃśatika-prajñāpāramitāmukha

In the Akṣobhyasya-tathāgatasyavyūha he is referred as the yakṣapati. The Lalitavistara states he is a yakṣa.The Mahāparinirvāṇa calls him the Yakṣarāja. The Gaganagañjaparipṛcchā calls him Vajrapani the yakṣa, as does the Vikurvāṇarājaparipṛcchā. The Vimalaprabhaparipṛcchā explains that he is the Yakṣarāja, the son of the yakṣa lord, Vaiśravana. The Dānapāramitā calls him the Mahānāyakaḥ, the great chief of all the yakṣas, as does the Nīlāmbaradharavajrapāṇi-rudratrivinaya-tantra, the Vajrapāṇinīlāmbaravidhivajrādaṇḍa-tantra, the Śrī-vajracaṇḍacittaguhya-tantra and the Śrī-vajracaṇḍacittaguhyatantrottarottara, the Vajrabhūmitricaraṇi-rājakalpa-nāma, the Saptatathāgatapūrvapraṇidhānaviśeṣavistara-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra, the Bhagavānbhaiṣajyaguruvaiḍūryaprabhasya-pūrvapraṇidhānaviśeṣavistara-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra, Mahāmaṇivipulavimānaviśvasupratiṣṭhitaguhyaparama-rahasyakalparāja-nāma-dhāraṇī, etc.

Vajrapani is just Vajrapani, whether in the Agamas/Nikayas, Vinaya, or the Vaipulya sūtras.

In short, Vajrapani is a tenth stage bodhisattva born among the Yakṣas.

Nonsense. So far, I have provided internal evidence within the Mahayana sutras (note I did not rely on any scholarly arguments, but pointed to what the Mahayana sutras themselves say) and pointed out that if Ananda and the other sravakas were indeed taught by the Buddha on these sutras 2500 years ago, it would be impossible for the First Council collection to not have these recited and gathered.  Neither you nor heart have given a viable response against those points raised.

Malcolm wrote:
Sure I have. Unlike you, I am not willing to engage in speculation as to why this was the case, given that Maitreya insists Mahāyāna is contemporary with what we term the "śrāvaka canon" right at the beginning of the Sūtrālaṃkara.

Further, the Vajrapāṇyabhiṣeka tantra and the Tathāgatācintyaguhyanirdeśa mahāyāna sūtra clearly maintain that Vajrapani is actually the collator of the sūtras. Abhayakaragupta states in the Āryāṣṭasāhasrikāprajñāpāramitāvṛttimarmakaumudī:

In the same way, the Tathāgatācintyaguhyanirdeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra explains the complier of "the separate and continuous explanations" and so on is the the lord of the tenth bhumi, the Mahābodhisattva Vajrapani, empowered to protect the rūpakāya and the dharmakāya of the tathāgatas after [the Buddha's] departure and where he is individually entrusted with the teachings in Vajrapāṇyabhiṣeka-sūtra. Whatever was entrusted to Ārya Ānanda, that was employed by the śravakas for the worldly, and not for the purpose of compiling the Dharma. The Bhagava's demonstrated of parinivana here. Because Ārya Vajrapani converts all worlds, he desired to compile the Prajñāpāramita and so on, after which he said "Thus have I heard..." and so on to the assembly of Mahābodhisattvas such as Ārya Maitreya and so on. Just as he heard it from the teacher, afterwards he recited it and in that same way others heard it from him. Thus Vajrapani is the compiler.

[

And the Buddha totally had no issues teaching Arhats bodhisattva doctrine and practices (as we can see so clearly in the Mahayana sutras), so your reasoning that Mahayana sutras were not recited in the First Council due to different domains is asinine - the Buddha didn't hesitate to teach Arhats bodhisattva doctrine, so if he really taught it when he was flesh-and-blood 2500 years ago, the Arhats would have totally no problem reciting and gathering them.

Malcolm wrote:
So here again, you are putting the śravakas as the authority which defines the validity of the Mahāyāna.

Obviously, we cannot get the Buddha's input on why the first council did not recite his Mahāyāna sūtras because he was not present. And, we do not need to assume every sūtra taught by the Buddha would have been gathered and recited there. This is the fundamental flaw with your thinking. You assume that if it was taught, it must have or should have been recited and the first council, which as far as anyone knows, had no bodhisattvas present. The point Bhava is making is that the first council only recited sūtras relevant to the attainment of the fruit of an arhat, not a bodhisattva or a buddha.

We know that the different groups have different sets of sūtras. The net effect of your implicit supposition is that only the sutras that all groups have in common can be regarded as what the Buddha actually taught; whereas, any sutras this or that group has which are not reflected in the whole collection of all canons must therefore be fakes. This is extremely bad reasoning.

pueraeternus said:
Of course - there is absolutely no good reason why the Mahayana sutras were not recited if they were really taught during the Buddha's earthly life, because even if the Arhats were of a smaller denomination, they were certainly part of the prime audience in many sutras, especially the prajnaparamitas. And the fact that the Buddha instructed Ananda to memorize and preserve the sutras destroys your (and whatever Indian master you favor) contention that only Manjushri and the bodhisattvas preserved the Mahayana canon.

Malcolm wrote:
No, it does not, for the reasons given above. We have no certainty whatsoever that all the sutras the Buddha taught were recited at the first council. Why? Because even different Mainstream canons contain different sets of sūtras.

At base, what should be contested is the supposition that the first council was a comprehensive review of all of the Buddha's teachings. What is our authority for believing this?

Remember, Indian Mahāyāna authors (despite your opinion that they were "asinine" in their belief that the Mahāyāna was not recited at the first council because the bodhisattva path did not concern trainees for arhatship and so on), they were Indian Buddhists, highly educated in their literature, to which they had far more access then we do today.

The scholarship on the subject tells only that which we have already known for centuries: Mahāyāna sūtras were not recited during the first council, but began to be written down about the same time as the Agamas and Nikāyas.

These are the only facts about them which we have at our disposal.

There are traditional accounts about how Mahāyāna was preserved. Those accounts clearly tell us that the Mahāyāna sūtras were all authored by the Buddha personally.

Then there is the point of view of western academics about the origin of these texts, which itself is purely speculative. It clearly tells us that not one of these texts was authored by the Buddha, that in effect it is an impossibility.

The net effect of following the latter position is that Mahāyāna is invalidated, the bodhisattva path and so on. The net effect of following the former position is that the Mahāyāna is validated, the bodhisattva path and so on.

But when for example, Buton Rinchen Drup maintains that that the Mahāyāna was collated by bodhisattvas on Mt.

Oh yes, I am sure that the Buddha didn't intend only "Samantabhadra, Mañjuśrī, Guhyapati, Maitreya and so on" to compile the Mahayana sutras, since he directly gave instructions to Ananda to memorize and preserve many.

Malcolm wrote:
Many, as we see, is four or five. Ānanda of course was not an arhat while Buddha was alive.

But we are talking about compilers of these texts. Ananda did not hear all of the sūtras the Buddha taught. He did not compile them all. For example, in the Ānanda sutra, the Buddha states:
Anything the Bhagavan taught before, he [Ānanda] does not hold those. It is not reasonable to say "Teach them again to him" because they reside in some other bhikṣus.
Thus it is not established at all that Ananda was even the sole compiler of the Mainstream Canon. Bhava argues there were several compilers.

Of course he appears in many Mahāyāna sūtras, but Ananda was not the compiler of Mahāyāna.
He was. The Buddha said so in many Mahayana sutras.

There is only one such statement as far as I can tell, found in the Mahākaruṇāpuṇḍarīka sūtra. Buddha here asked Ānanda to gather whatever the Buddha said.

However the Tathāgatācintyaguhyanirdeśa-sūtra asserts that Vajrapani is the compiler of all the sūtras of the Buddhas of the Bhadrakalapa.

Despite this contradiction, it is definitely the case that Bhava has a rather lengthy discussion about the issue of the compilation of the sūtras and he rejects the notion that they were compiled by the śrāvakas.

Oh, but he and other Arhats appeared in plenty of the early Mahayana sutras - that itself would be more than sufficient for the teachings to be gathered during the First Council.

Hi everyone

During the last webcast Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche mentioned, that if someone has a difficult year from astrological point of view, he can use lungtas to be able to overcome those difficulties. Somehow I can not understand how this is supposed to work. I mean, I put some prayer flags with auspicious symbols and good wishes on trees and assuming that I did this on appropriate day, I shall be able to overcome problems and otherwise not? Seems a little bit odd to me.

Malcolm wrote:
One, Tibetan "astrology" is not astrology in the sense you understand it. The term in Tibetan is "calculation", so here we are calculating the cycle of the phases in the five elements— wood, fire, earth, metal and water— through the year, through the month and through the day.

Tibetan elemental calculation is very general, and it serves only as a sort of weather report, i.e., when rain is predicted, it may not necessarily rain in your area, but you are wise to bring an umbrella. It is the same with elemental calculation, if it indicates that this or that person will have obstacles in a given year, it is sound to make do practices to prevent this.

Lungta flags are blessed by you, and there is a mantra, so there is a definite connection between your energy and the flags themselves. They also harmonize the five elements of a place because they are consecrated to do so. Whenever you see them, you should also recite that mantra, since it is increases their benefit for you.

It reminds me of the common criticism found in the popular versions of Mahayana (e.g. Zen and Tantra), that the common path of the bodhisattva, as it is actually presented by most of the sutras, takes too long and it is too difficult. What hardly anyone dares to consider is that those popular versions actually teach sravakayana under the pretence of "buddhahood in this life". Also, both Zen and Tantra are famous for emphasising discipleship (sravaka-hood). So, I'd add to Bhikkhu Bodhi's quote that hardly anyone wants to take the bodhisattva path, and all the arguments against Theravada are practically valid against the same people who use them.

Malcolm wrote:
"Buddhahood in the this life" means completing the two accumulations which lead to both freedom and omniscience.

It is impossible for someone to has generated bodhicitta to experience the fruit of an arhat, i.e. cessation, indeed, it is against the very principles of the bodhisattva path to do so.

how is it that none of that survived in the FIrst Council?

Malcolm wrote:
These sūtras were not compiled at the first council.

In the Madhyamakahṛdayavṛttitarkajvālā, Bhava reports:
Mahāyāna was spoken by the Buddha because it does not contradict the Dharma seals, one is introduced to the sūtra canon of the noble truth; because the afflicted are truly seen to be tamed; and because it does not conflict with dependent origination — all of those said to be "spoken by the Buddha" are found in Mahāyāna. Further, also each of the eighteen schools each introduce their own canon, but there are a great many mutual contradictions [between them]. The profound and vast methods of benefitting others in Mahāyāna are not introduced at all in the sutra canon of the śravakas. Mahāyāna introduces the bodhisattva training appearing in seven hundred topics. Because the teaching of emptiness does not contradict the Dharma itself, therefore, the Dharma seals are not contradicted. Due to this, Mahāyāna was spoken by the Buddha because the compilers of the basic [texts],  Samantabhadra, Mañjuśrī, Guhyapati, Maitreya and so on, compiled them. The compilers of our basic [texts]  were not the śravakas because Mahāyāna discourses are not their domain.
In other words,  though the arhats were present at Mahāyāna teachings, it was not the path they were on, and not the path they wanted to preserve since they did not have the bodhisattva motivation. Thus, they compiled only the teachings they found relevant for nirvana and ignored those which treated the Bodhisattva path and did not memorize them or recite them.

Bhava reports a citation from a text called the Śālmalīvana-sutra *:
Ānanda, I comprehend even more Dharma than however many leaves there are in this śālmalī grove, but I have not taught them to you. Since that many were taught for a purpose, you must not be regretful, but you should also not be without desire [to hear them].
In response to the qualm that Ānanda heard all of the sutras:
If it is said "Ārya Ānanda comprehended all of the sūtras", with respect to that, the Uttama sūtra* states: "There is not even one bhikṣu holding the number of Dharmas held by Śakra, the king of the devas." Since that is so, Ānanda did not hold all of the Dharma. Therefore, the vast teachings of the Buddha are not seen in that authentic compilation Ānanda demonstrated and compiled authentically.
Bhava continues in this vein for quite some time. The point is that a) arhats did not preserve all the teachings of the Buddha b) Ānanda did not know all of the sūtras.

So, you are saying that "the Buddha taught them" is not hermeneutics, it is simple fact, while the hermeneutics taught therein are valid, etc. because of this authorship by the historical Buddha, in the same way that the Nikayas are valid because of their authorship -- because the historical Buddha taught the content.

Parsing anything about this - such as e.g. that the Nikayas are stratified and not wholly Buddhavacana, or that Mahayana is wholly later... all of that, to any historian, text-critical examiner, etc, the reply is that
Adopting the western text critical view of Mahāyāna sūtras is not virtuous.
Do I understand correctly?
Indeed you do. Indeed, Theravadins should adopt precisely the same attitude —why? Because these days even the Pali Canon is coming under attack from the very same forces who initially caused Mahāyāna to fall into disrepute.

In short, it is not virtuous to regard teachings in the Agamas/Nikāyas and well as the Mahāyāna canon to be anything other than taught by the Buddha. I am not insisting that of adherents of the Mainstream canons necessarily must accord validity to Mahāyāna canon; or those who are adherents of common Mahāyāna necessarily must accept Vajrayāna — they should remain a place free of judgement. But for those of us who are Mahāyānis and Vajrayānis, well, it is better for us to simply accept all these teachings as the teachings of the historical Buddha where it is so indicated, unless there are absolutely compelling reasons to believe otherwise.

Likewise I don't believe the Naga story about Nagarjuna, yet I accept it as authentic Dharma. It is an appropriate elaboration on Sakyamuni's original teachings, the appropriateness being validated by Nagarjuna's own realization. It is an extension of Sakyamuni, not Sakyamuni's personal teaching.

I don't agree. And I don't thinks it serves our purposes in Mahāyāna take this perspective.

People with realization can add to Dharma, and have done so. People that have not been able to gain realization should not alter even one letter of it. That is why contemporary people that have failed at Dharma should not be the ones leading the charge to change it. That is taking the teachings of enlightened awareness and making them the teachings of ignorant unawareness.

Did Sakyamuni teach the 6 Yogas of Naropa? I don't' think so. Dzogchen? I don't' think so. If you say Vajradhara taught them, ok. (Vajradhara being the enlightenment of Sakyamuni as seen from the Vajrayana perspective.) But that means that the history of it will show up some time after the Paranirvana, when it comes back down to the human realm. If you say that Sakyamuni could still teach after the Paranirvana, then that is the same as saying later authors could, based on their own realization, contribute to the Canon. It is saying the same thing two different ways.

The best approach is to simply discuss the teachings with the understanding that Buddha actually taught themselves himself as we Mahāyānists have been doing for the past 2000 years and ignore what outsiders think. People become interested in Mahāyāna because they have the merit to do so, not because of some evangelism on the part of Mahāyānists.

I think the origin of the Mahayana Sutras is from 'visionary encounters' with the Buddha which could be understood as 'seeing the dharma by penetrating its meaning' or as 'insight into the true meaning of the Buddha's teaching through Prajñāpāramitā.' These insights were then codified into the Prajñāpāramitā sutras, amongst others.

Understood thus, I have always thought that these texts were the authentic word, even if not literally remembered and spoken in the same way as the early texts.

In this way one's point of view is unassailable when it comes to explicating points where the Buddha's teaching in Mahāyāna sūtras surpasses or seem to contradict those teachings found in the Mainstream canons.

It is possible that one interpretation of what the Buddha said is more authoritative than another interpretation, but resorting to authority is my last resort for understanding what the Buddha said.

The Buddha said many things and unless one is as awakened as the Buddha himself, practically whatever he said would be interpreted by one's intellect.  What is important as far as I am concerned is the consistency of interpretation (understanding) of one aspect with other aspects of the Buddha's teachings.

We have a record of Tsogyal outside the Nyingma Milieu which dates to the mid 12th century, i.e., there is a mention of her oral instructions concerning Vajrakīlaya in the Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen's collected works: http://tbrc.org/link?RID=O01CT0026%7CO01CT002600KG04134$W22271. The text from 793-794 mentiones that it is advice given to her on Guru Rinpoche's departure from Tibet.

Thus, we can see here that the Khon tradition clearly mentions her. Its very unlikely that Jetsun Rinpoche would be following the lead of Nyangral, given how stringent Sakyapas are about lineage, and how dubious they were about the nascent gter ma tradition. In my opinion, we can safely say that this advice was included in their ancestral teachings.

Therefore, I personally see no valid reason whatsoever to doubt the historicity of a Tibetan woman named Yeshe Tsogyal who was Padmasambhava's companion.

That's not a Mahayana perspective. A Mahayanaist would understand the Arhat to have a continuation. In fact, the Mahayana perspective says that after a long while the Arhats are roused out of their sleep by the blessing of the bodhisattvas so they can continue on with the practice of the Mahayana.

Arhats have made an end to suffering, but have, in the Mahāyāna analysis, mistaken the samadhi of cessation for the ultimate fruit of the path.

Malcolm wrote:
Three things are required to turn the tide of Buddhist modernism, especially of the academic variety:

1) We must resist the temptation to fall under the spell of text criticism. The text critical approach is forensic and speculative. It proceeds from Western hermeneutical prejudices founded in a materialist notion of what a "text" is. It also is born out of a Western idea of historiography. Text criticism, used as a means of discerning the origin of Buddhist texts and its developments, results in nothing more than speculative conjectures being taken as facts by the reading public, and by many Buddhists as well. These speculative conjectures harm the foundations of Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna in particular, which are seen as modifications or corruptions of an ur-canon.

2) We must resist the attempt to erect science as our final authority in all matters of cosmology, theories of consciousness, etc. While not disregarding modern science and so on, we must insist that domain of Buddhadharma is necessarily outside of scientific inquiry. The origin of Buddhadharma is the awakening of the Buddha. There is no way the mundane sciences can either enhance our understanding of Dharma nor can it replace the Dharma.

3) We must insist that on fact the Buddhist canon, all sutra, tantra and Vajrayāna originate with the Buddhas in general, and Śakyamuni Buddha in particular. We must take into consideration that the very survival of Buddhism as a living tradition depends on the integrity of the origins of the teachings. In particular, we must insist on the necessity that the timeless teachings of the Buddhas transcend mundane concerns about space and time, existing as a remedy for the suffering of all sentient beings, wherever they may be. Therefore, the teachings of the Buddhas, whether directly, by permission or by blessing should be accepted as they are at face value as the teaching of the Buddha. It is only in this way that the integrity of the Buddhist tradition will be preserved. This is not to say that all Buddhists must accept all canons as being of equal value. We need to recognize that all the Buddha's teachings have value for different people at different stages in their evolution on the path.

Therefore, engaging with people addicted to text criticism or historical analysis of Buddhist texts, or who have aim to replace key concepts in Buddhadharma with concepts drawn from the mundane sciences should be considered extraneous distractions and such people's qualms and objections must be ignored, because trying to deflect or negate such misguided criticisms of materialists, made by non-practitioners, or Theravadin practitioners is completely useless. If they say Mahāyāna is not the teaching of the Buddha, we must insist that it is. If they claim the Vajrayāna teachings are not the teaching of the Buddha, we insist that it is. If they claim that termas are not the teaching of the Buddha, we insist that they are and leave it at that. Many long, stupid conversations will be blunted in the beginning by a simple statement "This is a teaching of the Buddha. If you don't think so, you are welcome to your opinion but I am not interested in discussing it with you further." Such discussions are not useful for anyone's practice, their's, if they have one, or ours. Further, we create much non-virtue and negative traces by engaging in such discussions. So it is time to just stop.

attached to the salty taste of desire, 
bound by the neck with the noose of confusion, 
burned with the hot fire of hatred, 
head covered with pride, 
setting a rendezvous with the mistress of jealousy, 
surrounded by the army of enmity...
tied by the neck with the noose of subject and object, [29b]
stuck in the mud of successive traces
and handcuffed with the ripening of karma.
Having been joined with the ripening of karma, 
one takes bodies good and bad, 
one after another like a water wheel,
born into each individual class.
Having crossed at the ford of self-grasping, 
one sinks into the ocean of suffering
and one is caught by the heart on the hook of the three lowers realms.
One is bound by oneself; the afflictions are the enemy.

"If he wants, he recollects his manifold past lives,[3] i.e., one birth, two births, three births, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, one hundred, one thousand, one hundred thousand, many aeons of cosmic contraction, many aeons of cosmic expansion, many aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion, [recollecting], 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure and pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus he remembers his manifold past lives in their modes and details. He can witness this for himself whenever there is an opening."

Malcolm wrote:
It is intended literally. There is nothing here to dispute, conventionally speaking.

Andrew108 said:
But one wonders how could it be possible? How could all these memories survive so many lives when there were lives where we didn't have language or developed senses capable of recording and storing that information. Why was it that the Buddha couldn't talk about the evolution of species or what life was like on other planets. It seems that life on other planets was much like life on this one?

Malcolm wrote:
Life in Sukhavati for example, is nothing like life on this one.


Andrew108 said:
How does this memory survive after brain death? What is it about consciousness that enables it to contain so much information and why is that information not ordinarily available to us? Then there is a kind of folkism here where memory is seen like a serial display and that one needs only rewind to uncover past events. It seems if you develop the jhanas then that is the kind of capacity you will have. The way you remember things will be serial.

Malcolm wrote:
In general, for ordinary beings, the shock of being unconscious at the moment of conception is said to render our past live memories unavailable. Bodhisattvas in their last life however are conscious through the entire process of conception, gestation and birth.

When one enters into the concentration of recalling past lives, indeed one starts with this life and that starts with the present and works one's way back.

Memory is serial because consciousness is serial. Memory, as I already explained to you from Candrakirti, is not different than the consciousness that experienced the event. So the process consists of recalling every serial sense impression from beginningless time.

Consciousness is empty, there is nothing preventing consciousness from recalling all of its past objects other than our present obscurations. Just as there is nothing preventing karma from ripening because karma too is empty.

But if you try to understand these things in physicalist terms it will never make any sense.

Then by your admission, Central Tibet was some ruled in some way by the Gelug during the time of the 5th Dalai Lama to the 6th, then there was a 40 year period (this would overlap with the life of the 6th and the 7th), then from some point during the life of the 7th the Gelug rule again in some form up to the 13th.  Is that correct?

Malcolm wrote:
I was very precise. The government established by the Fifth collapsed when when Lozang Khan invaded, and Desid Sangye Gyatso was assassinated by Lozang Khan's wife (a former mistress of his) in 1705 (I said 1704, but oh well). The Desid never allowed the Sixth to rule.

Central Tibet remained without any effective government at all, apart from warlords, until Pho lha nas, an aristocrat from Tsang, ruled Tibet from 1727-1748 with Qing backing.

The seventh was installed by the Qianglong emperor in 1751. The Kashag itself was a creation was a creation of the Qianglong emperor.

Please get your facts straight, Kirt. I expect better from you. The Central Tibetans were ruled by the Qing, so they could not be a theocracy either.

Your characterization of the brief rein of the 5th Dalai Lama is correct.  The rest was an obfuscation.  Although a specific Mongol group reinvaded and disposed the 6th Dalai Lama, it appears that the Gelugs were more or less in charge of Central Tibet at least through the beginning of the rule of the 13th Dalai Lama.  This was enforced at least nominally from Beijing.

No that is not correct. There were two separate secular regimes over a period of 40 or so years, before the 7th was installed.

Buddha, in Mahāyāna sutras, was acting out of his infinite and omniscient compassion. Not only that, while Śariputra may seem like a foil against which many unkind tricks were played, Śariputra in fact is a very high bodhisattva on the stages, a player in the drama of the Mahāyāna sutras.

I think that until I am at that level, I will refrain from criticizing the other vehicles.

Of course, when we openly discuss the fact that Vajrayāna promises the ideal practitioner full buddhahood replete with the two accumulations in a single life, it is natural that others might feel criticized or that we are making "triumphalist claims", but we are not. There isn't even one single Mainstream sutra or Mahāyāna sūtra that suggests that full buddhahood can be attained in a single life, so what need to mention the complete absence of the methods of doing so? Moreover, the Mainstream Sūtras do not detail the path of the bodhisattva, so people who wish the embark on the career of a bodhisattva must learn that from Mahāyāna sūtras. The Mainstream sūtra teachings have one goal primarily, to guide people to the four fruits of the śravakas path.

It was another 50 years before a Dalai Lama was the nominal ruler of Central Tibet and Tsang. Even here, principalities like Sakya in Western Tsang maintained their independence.

Malcolm wrote:
Well for example, in Mahāyāna sūtras, it very clearly explains that the Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī actually attained samyakasambuddhahood countless eons ago. If it is the case that in Mahāyāna they accepted the statement in the Dhātubahuka-sūtra as authoritative, how is it that Mañjuśrī could appear as a disciple of the Buddha? For example,in the bKa' 'gyur, the translated words of the Buddha, the Ārya-mañjuśrīnāmāṣṭaśataka praises Mañjuśrī in the following words:
You are a Buddha, a pratyekabudddha,
and you are the Primordial Buddha.
How can this be possible, if the Dhātubahuka-sūtra is to be regarded as definitive?

Further, to underscore the point that Mahāyāna sūtras are more definitive for Mahāyāna followers than Mainstream Buddhist Sūtras, consider the following from the Arya-sandhinirmocana-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:
At first, since the Bhagavan demonstrated the aspects of the four noble truths to those correctly participating in the vehicle in the deer park called Ṛṣivadanam, the amazing Dharma wheel he turned first was amazing, a corresponding Dharma had not been turned in the past by any deva nor any human. However, that Dharma wheel that the Bhagavan turned was surpassable, contextual, of provisional meaning, and a basis for contention. The Bhagavan turned a second very amazing Dharma wheel with the aspects beginning with the absence of inherent existence of phenomena, and beginning with their nonarising, noncessation, peace from the beginning, and intrinsic parinirvana to those correctly participating in the Mahāyāna. However, that Dharma Wheel turned by the Bhagavan too was surpassable, contextual, of provisional meaning, and a basis for contention. The Bhagavan then turned the third very amazing Dharma Wheel perfectly differentiating for those correctly participating in all vehicles beginning with the absence of inherent existence of phenomena, and beginning with their nonarising, noncessation, peace from the beginning, and intrinsic parinirvana. This Dharma Wheel turned by the Bhagavan is unsurpassable, not circumstantial, definitive in meaning, and not a basis of contention.
Here you can see that Mahāyāna sūtra, the teaching of the Mahāyāna is clearly defined as definitive. while the teaching of the Mainstream Buddhists, the Agamas and so on are defined as provisional in meaning, etc.

There are indeed a few scattered Śravakayāna sūtras in the bKa' 'gyur in the mdo sde section, but in any case, these are not considered as authoritative as Mahāyāna sūtras,

As pointed out to you, now for the third time, I have not, and no one has said, that there can be two SUPREME nirmanakāyas in a given world system, but there is nothing forbidding anyone to obtain the same result as the Buddha himself in this world system during the dispensation of Shakyamuni's Dharma. Such persons therefor are nirmanakāyas, known as "nirmanakāyas through birth" because they have fully completed both stores of wisdom and merit and are completely free from the two obscurations. NIrmanakāyas are Buddhas.

But not necessarily the supreme authority of any of the Mainstream Buddhist canons.

For example, in Tibetan Buddhism, the doctrine of the three kinds of nirmanakāyas comes from the Sutrālaṃkara attributed to the Maitreya Bodhisattva. Because this text is by a tenth stage bodhisattva, it is considered to Buddhavacana. Likewise, the Three Bodhisattva Commentaries on the Tantras are considered in the same light since they are authored, according to tradition, by tenth stage Bodhisattvas.

Copied from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tummo " onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false; by Kurt Keutzer
Kundalini yoga in the Natha Sampradaya and Vajrayana in Tibetan Buddhism both take their origin from the Mahasiddhas who were active in India from the 8th century to the 12th century. Kundalini yoga practices formed the core of the teachings of a number of these Mahasiddhas and are strongly represented in both Tibetan Buddhist practices and contemporary kundalini yoga practices. Kundalini yoga was spoken of as "Candali yoga" by these Mahasiddhas and became known as gTummo rnal 'byor in Tibet. Candali yoga was a key practice of the famous Tibetan yogin Milarepa.

How does this claim fit in the picture?

What little I've heard or read of tummo, they have to do with breathing, moving attention and visualising in the central channel in the spine. I don't mean to be a drag Malcolm but what you say is a major surprise for me. If spine practices nor kundalini energy are utilised what do they/you guys do then? No specific information needed, just general remarks with slight explanations, please.

Malcolm wrote:

Yes, caṇḍali yoga involves kumbhaka.

The http://www.amidanet.com/contemplation-sutra.htm says about birth on the lowest level of the lowest grade:

"Because he calls the Buddha's Name, with each repetition, the evil karma which he has committed during eighty kotis of kalpas of Samsara is extinguished. When he comes to die, he sees before him a golden lotus-flower like the disk of the sun, and in an instant he is born within a lotus-bud in the Land of Utmost Bliss. After twelve great kalpas the lotus-bud opens. When the flower opens, Avalokiteshvara and Mahasthamaprapta teach him with voices of great compassion the method of extinguishing evil karma through the realization of Suchness of all dharmas. Hearing this, he rejoices and immediately awakens aspiration for Enlightenment."

The 19th vow in the http://www.amidanet.com/larger-sutra-1.htm:

"If, when I attain Buddhahood, sentient beings in the lands of the ten quarters, who awaken aspiration for Enlightenment, do various meritorious deeds and sincerely desire to be born in my land, should not, at their death, see me appear before them surrounded by a multitude of sages, may I not attain perfect Enlightenment."

And vow 46:

"If, when I attain Buddhahood, bodhisattvas in my land should not be able to hear spontaneously whatever teachings they may wish, may I not attain perfect Enlightenment."

Malcolm wrote:
These three statements have nothing to do with buddhahood in one lifetime. There is a very strong Amitabha tradition in Tibetan Buddhism, it is an important practice for millions of Tibetans.

Malcolm wrote:
First of all, Buddha differentiates the bodhi of a buddha and the bodhi of an arhat.

Secondly, Buddha taught according to the needs of the disciples he had in front of him. They compiled a canon. He taught other things to devas, brahmans, kṣatriyas, etc. He even says so himself in the Mainstream sūtras, but he does not state what he taught them.

And Buddha was not the founder of Buddhadharma. Buddhadharma has existed for eons and eons in many different expressions. Sometimes there is a monastic Sangha, sometimes there isn't a monastic Sangha and so on.

Moreover, the Buddha explains in the Lankāvatara sūtra that he is not even the definitive buddha.

In any case, if you want to understand the difference between the bodhi of an Arhat and a Bodhisattva, you should read Maitreya's Abhisamayālaṃkara, which explains the Prajñāpāramitasūtras treatment of the bodhi of arhats and so on.

Of course not all realms of rebirth are material, so in those "places" consciousness is sustained on karma alone.

Does the Bodhisattva not have to attain liberation from delusion? So does the Vajra path speed that up?

Malcolm wrote:
Arhats are liberated from affliction, according the Sarvastivadins, Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas still posses a non-afflictive ignorance. Only a Buddha is completely free from all afflictive obscurations. Further, according the Lankāvatara, Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas are roused from the samahdi of cessation in which they enter at their death, only to begin on the bodhisattva path. There are also differences in the depth of emptiness taught in the Mainstream Canon, i.e. the Agamas and Nikayas.

So, yes, the Vajrayāna does speed up the process, because unlike common Mahāyāna where emptiness is the result, etc., Vajrayāna experientially introduces the wisdom to be realized right at the very beginning.

Since someone asked, I have answered.

Granted, in order gain the satisfaction of Vajrayāna claims, one must do the practice very perfectly and study and practice under a qualified guru.

The Avatamska sūtra, volume nga, folio 147a, Lhasa:
Oh Jinaputras, when the samyaksambuddha, the unsurpassed dharmarāja, manifests with an unceasing manifestation of Dharma, the entire dharmadhātu is entirely filled with the cloud of dharmakāya, and truly shows a cloud of kaȳas according to the inclinations of sentient beings. In this way, each and every sentient being is fully shown a cloud of kāyas being born; each and every sentient being is fully shown a cloud of nirmanakāyas; each and every sentient being is fully shown a cloud of kāyas of blessings; each and every sentient being is fully shown a cloud of rūpakāyas; each and every sentient being is fully shown a cloud of full accomplished variegated kāyas; each and every sentient being is fully shown a cloud of punyakāyas; each and every sentient being is fully shown a cloud of jñānakāyas; each and every sentient being is fully shown a cloud of unconquerable strong kāyas; each and every sentient being is fully shown a cloud of fearless splendid kāyas.
The Lanka states:
In delightful Akaniṣṭha,
beyond the pure abodes,
the true Buddha becomes a Buddha;
an emanated one becomes a Buddha here.
So you see, there is no reason any number of persons cannot become Buddha here on Jambudvipa, because Buddhas do not, according to Mahāyāna, actually attain buddhahood here anyway.

It is true that teaching of the variegated nirmankāya is more throughly taught in Vajrayāna texts, but it is present in Mahāyāna as well, as you can see from the above.

This claim is hard to believe, since the Buddha is not really known for making such a distinction. The Suttas are about liberation, and according to them the arahats attain full release. Of course one can believe that there is something higher and beyond, but this is a belief, and one based on latter developments. I take it no one here surpassed arahatship?

But considering that most of us are not going to, and seeing that the Buddha taught that release is possible in this lifetime too, I think it takes the wind out of the Vajra claim. As far as I can make out, the speediest path is the one that one is ready to commit to fully, and the one with the right teacher and Sangha.

Malcolm wrote:
No one doubts that the Mainstream Buddhist path brings about freedom, in the sense of full freedom from afflictions, that is the awakening of an arhat or a pratyekabuddha. But that is not the awakening to which Vajrayāna refers. The awakening to which Vajrayāna refers is the full buddhahood that results from gathering the two accumulations as taught Mahāyāna. The bodhisattva path is not detailed in any of the Mainstream canons. For the Mainstream canons, it is extra-canonical.

I have to keep repeating myself because you are not understanding the implications of what I am saying.

We don't need to enter into a philosophical debate about the nature of energy.

Yes and no.

There is no means for realizing total buddhahood in Mainstream Buddhism, not in Theravada, not in Sarvastivada nor in Dharmaguptaka, the only three Mainstream Buddhist schools left.

In Mahāyāna, total Buddhahood takes a minimum of three incalculable eons, for the best practitioner.

In Vajrayāna, total Buddhahood can be realized in a single lifetime by the best practitioner, but even if you do not practice, as long as you maintain your vows perfectly, one will achieve total Buddha within seven lifetimes.

You can either accept or reject these accounts as you wish. There is really nothing to argue about. Incidentally, I am merely reporting the assertions made in these schools. Whether one accepts these assertions or not depends upon one's own inclinations.

That does not really answer the question. It is not a question whether science is "honest" -- indeed, there is as much faith and zeal among scientists in scientific endeavor as there is in evangelical Christians. The question is, can you reconcile what you truly have faith in, i.e. science, with the Buddha's teachings? Unlike Andrew, for example, I don't think that science as gotten at what consciousness is, they don't have the math for it, consciousness cannot be mathematically modeled. I don't think that science will ever be able to get at consciousness because consciousness is not a physical process, in the end, even though nama and rūpa do interact. But the interaction is strictly one way, consciousness interacts with matter, matter does not interact with consciousness. Our brains, our physical eyes, our body are all, in essence, inert matter, conventionally speaking (forget about going into higher Buddhist teachings like Dzogchen where matter is merely the reified luminosity of consciousness). Chemical processes do not amount to consciousness. There is no experiment that can produce consciousness. Consciousness cannot be created in a lab. There is no way to verify experimentally what consciousness is at all, that is, not by any means known to western science. But there is a means to know these things and it involves personally developing the skills to verify the Buddha's teachings on such issues. It's not hard, per se, you just have to be dedicated, and do the work.

My advice is that you should practice as if you accept rebirth. A Buddhist version of Pascal's wager, as it were.

The apparent contradiction is due to the fact that I attribute the Buddha's teaching of literal rebirth to skillful means on his part. But that is a point of contention that I feel it best not to elaborate on.

Praṇā and warmth are the supports for consciousness.

But it has energy. Warmth? What do you mean warmth? If it had no mass how could it have warmth? Bizarre.

Malcolm wrote:
Consciousness does not have warmth, warmth is a support for consciousness, as is lifeforce.

Unknown said:
The preceding moment of consciousness, i.e. the mental organ (manendriya) acts as the support for consciousness the same way that a son becomes the father of another; a fruit, the seed of another.

Malcolm wrote:
The preceding moment of consciousness is as massless as the following moment? So how does a massless mental organ exist? The examples you give all have mass.
Well, "organ" is not a completely adequate translation of indriya. Indriya really means "faculty" or power. The mental organ is not an organ like cakṣuendriya, for example, i.e. the eye faculty.

Unknown said:
No substrate is necessary, according to Madhyamakas. The Yogacara sūtras propose the ālayavijñāna to account for memory, continuity and so on.

Malcolm wrote:
But a mental organ is necessary or is the mental organ something that is made at the same time as the following moment of consciousness?
No, the mental faculty (lets not call it an organ since that is really not the right term) is the immediately preceding moment of consciousness.

Unknown said:
The point here is that the mental organ and the moment of consciousness can't exist at the same time. So one must precede the other and therefore you have continuity based on a continuing mental organ and moment of consciousness. Here continuing mental organ is no other than functional 'substrate' for continuing moment of consciousness.

Malcolm wrote:
There is a continuing mental faculty in as much as this moment of consciousness always arises on the basis of the previous moment; the immediately antecedent moment of consciousness is always the mental faculty.

Seeds and sprouts cannot exist at the same time, still, sprouts come from seeds, and produce other seeds all in good time, when there is proper cause and condition.

Unknown said:
So this doesn't accord with Madhyamaka reasoning or the definitive teachings of Buddha.

Malcolm wrote:
It obviously corresponds with Madhyamaka teachings since Candrakirti instructs us that the functions of memory and so on are worldly conventions, and as such should not be examined. Or did you just choose to ignore the citation about memory taken from his commentary on MAV 6:75. Ultimately, of course, it cannot bear analysis -- but then, neither can any conventional phenomena. Still, since we are deluded, in the refined sense of not being free from grasping at self, for us conventional truth is where we live.

Unknown said:
Consciousness is driven by thirst for existence.

Malcolm wrote:
So it has that kind of characteristic? How does it know to strive for existence? Or is it like a seed striving to find the light? Is it instinctive? If so then how can a massless thing like consciousness also have instinct and striving?
As before, consciousness is that which knows objects. When it is contaminated, it experiences craving.

There is a fundamental contradiction in Buddhism:

The Buddha is known as an independent thinker and innovator. We are encouraged to emulate him, yet are obliged to follow his teaching without question and without making any compensation for the enormous social and cultural changes that have occurred over the 2000+ years since it was written down.

Malcolm wrote:
You are obliged only to understand what the Buddha himself meant by suffering, the cause of suffering, it's cessation, and the path.

Despite all the enormous cultural changes, there is one thing that is still true: there is suffering because of karma, and there is karma because of affliction.

The Buddha framed his entire teaching in terms of rebirth. If this is discarded, then Buddha's teachings collapse like an old house.

There is no point in teaching a path to nirvana if there is no rebirth in samsara.
