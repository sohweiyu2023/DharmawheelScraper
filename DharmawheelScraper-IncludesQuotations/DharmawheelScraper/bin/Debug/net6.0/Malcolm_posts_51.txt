You are over-defining what avihimsa actually means. It is for this reason I am criticizing your point of view.

The Vegan definition of ahimsa and the Buddha's teaching on ahimsa are not the same. The Vegan definition of ahimsa comes from Gandhi, and while Gandhi was not a Jain, he was strongly influenced by Jainism in his views. Like the Jains, not only are you defining ahimsa as avoiding killing, you over extend it to mean that you should not drink milk, use honey, etc. This is far beyond the range of what Buddha taught as ahimsa.

So both the Gelugpas and Karma Kagyupas are off base. Lol, no bias there!

Malcolm wrote:
Not all Karma Kagyus were gzhan stong pas (for example, the 8th Karmapa, who refuted it). Gzhan stong only became a Karma Kagyu brand in the late 18th century. And even then, really only at Palpung, which had a close relationship with the Kathok (the one Nyingma monastery where it was very prevalent, also from the late 18th century, as I have already explained to you).

So, it is not that Karma Kagyu is "off base", since gzhan stong does not define it, it is just gzhan stong that is a bit of a problem. Gelug view is more or less a mirror image of gzhan stong.

Buddhadharma points unflinchingly to non-harming of sentient beings.

Malcolm wrote:
Avihimsa is a mental factor associated with all positive minds in the desire realm. It is not, within Buddhadharma, an ideological commitment. It is connected with personal conduct (śīla), specifically, of actively engaging in killing other sentient beings.

You would be very surprised at how few sūtras mention it. It is mentioned in only two Vinaya texts, twenty three sūtras, and eleven tantric texts in the Tibetan Canon. These mentions are very brief. In other words, there is very little sustained discussion of this concept, and certainly no ideological dimension in any of the discussions of nonharming.

While it is true that the benefits of being free from a harmful mind is praiseworthy, what it boils down to is that if your mind is free from harmfulness, himsa, you will not kill things, or ask others to do so for you.

It has nothing to do with whether or not you use honey, milk, eat meat, wear leather shoes, or even furs. It has everything to with how you treat sentient beings you encounter day to day and your freedom from the impulse to harm them.

Using honey is not harmful to bees, no more than milking cows is harmful to cows.

Neither is any diet a bar to it. It is of a different level of reality.

So, as we all know, the Buddha was omniscient. He did not talk nonsense. If he stated that honey was actually acceptable to eat, and, in fact for monks something that could be eaten outside of their limited rations (when considered as medicine), and also something that is considered as good food for meditators, it goes without saying, that in order to eat honey, you necessarily have to collect it before consumption.

Honey has had a central place in Buddhadharma since day one as a very precious substance, and there is nothing wrong with it. Observe the following, from the Lankavatara Sutra:

" Now, Mahamati, the diet I have allowed for my disciples to take is satisfying to all wise people, but is avoided by the unwise. This diet produces many merits, keeps away many harmful effects, and was prescribed by the ancient sages. It comprises rice, barley, wheat, kidney beans, beans, lentils, oil, honey, molasses, treacle, sugar cane, coarse sugar, and similar foods. Food prepared with these ingredients is proper food.

This goes to show that the Buddha was not a vegan.

Kindness to, and non-harming of, animals is inherent to all forms of Buddhadharma. Vegan ideology is Buddhadharma because Vegan ideology = kindness, compassion and non-harming of sentient beings.

Malcolm wrote:
Buddhadharma says we must even treat the soil with kindness, the plants that live in it, etc. Avihimsa does not merely apply to animals. It applies to the entire world. And of course, in my opinion, we need to recognize that plants are also sentient communities. Even colonies of bacteria display sentient properties. What happens to your Vegan ideology then?

Sanders is saying, "Electing me is only the beginning. Without you, without continuous engagement in the democratic process, nothing will change. It is up to you, not me."

Śruta means hearing.

Queen Elizabeth II said:
True enough, yet in many modern Indian languages a person of great learning is called a bahuśruta, "one who has heard much" (e.g. Hindi बहुश्रुत and Gujarati બહુશ્રુત), no matter if he got that learning by reading books or by sitting at the feet of his guru. Is there any reason why in a Buddhist context the meaning of śruta should be strictly limited to things heard and that learning acquired by reading would not count as prajñā?

Malcolm wrote:
Such a person of great learning learned by sitting with their guru and orally reciting texts: first the ācarya gives a passage, indicating proper rhythm, tone, and so on, passage by passage, one at a time, and the student repeats it until it is memorized. Along with this, the meaning will be explained. Texts support this process, but by no means can they replace it. This kind of learning is fundamentally different than the sort of discursive learning we prefer today. The invention of the printing press fundamentally changed the way Europeans related to texts and the process of learning.

Classical Indian teachings tend to assume that three things are necessary for realization: 1) personal experience; 2) a teacher; and 3) scriptures. Why?

And personal experience prevents it from being a merely intellectual exercise.

A scripture simply can't tell you whether you're on the right track or not.

I'd say that's true of the duller folks who study Madhyamika... the ones who get lost in it precisely as they're warned not to.

They tend to emphasize the ultimacy of the analysis and ignore the remainder. Sad for them.

The remainder is what's interesting, IMHO. But you need to put the Madhyamika aside and utilize alternative methodologies for that.

To belabor the metaphor, if the pyre is soaked with water it will not burn. Then it is still nothing but afflictions. The only scenario whereby a monk can take a consort without breaking his vow of celibacy is if the pyre is bone-dry (renunciation) and the fire burns as wisdom.

But with an asterisk. My Gelug mentor told me that even in the Vajrayana the defilements are not to be indulged in per se. If they can be transmuted into wisdoms they are the means to enlightenment and therefore part of the Path. But if they remain as defilements they are still the source of suffering/dukkha.

He did not elaborate much beyond that, but my impression is that the Vajrayana still has "renunciation" as a premise. What it does not have is avoidance of anything in life--as long as it is lived with refuge, renunciation, and bodhicitta.

AFAIK, when the samaya is given at the end of the empowerment and it is said "The samaya is the view", then there is no specific practice commitment as such, and one unifies that practice with one's view (which to me is hugely challenging as practice).

But if a Vajra Master gives a specific practice commitment, then I see that as a literal instruction.  It's not my domain to literally reinterpret that.  (But one could always go to the VM as state why it's not possible to keep that practice commitment).  I admire magnus for walking out of that Yamantaka empowerment... that's a sign of respect and perspective.

I was told after taking the Sakya Vajrakilaya that the standard Vajrakilaya mantra would not suffice for the recitation commitment, and that one was required to do that specific mantra.

I must confess I don't do a lot of various daily practices that many of my better vajra brothers and sisters do, but I've been taught these practices combine to effect ones tendrul and manifestation and auspicious connections.

In the case of many great masters they did many daily practices, and regular retreats on these different practices.  In general, they are lineage holders, and myself, best to focus on the heart of the practice I'm focusing on.

Quite honestly, this is not what all the great masters of the past have taught. This practice 1) comes from lower tantras. 2) it arises from lineage provincialism.

For example, while it is the case that Vajrabhairava and Yamantaka are separate lineages, etc., there is not point in practicing both. There is no point in practicing the Sakya and the Gelug transmissions of Naro Khachö separately. There is no point in practicing two different forms of Hevajra, Vakrakilaya, or Kalacakra.

The way to unify all commitments is in Guru Yoga. If you understand this, you understand the real point of the teachings.

It is said that when Atisha came to Tibet, he thought he had nothing really to share, until he noticed one day that Rinchen Zangpo was practicing different several mandalas a day. Then Atisha realized he had a purpose and advised Rinchen Zangpo (many years his senior) to focus on one mandala, commenting, "Tibetans practice one hundred mandalas and realize none, whereas Indians practice one mandala and realize all."

Most obviously your criticism of Buddhist academics and scholars who conclude that Mahayana is a later development (Ray is also clearly saying this above) and that the historical Buddha was not teaching Mahayana/Vajrayana concurrently. I think your criticism reveals a clear double standard.

Malcolm wrote:
You are discussing two separate issues:

One, there is Ray's opinions about the formation of Mahāyāna. All modern research about the putative formation of Mahāyāna is at best speculative and there are very contradictory opinions in the scholarship. For example, no one takes Ray's thesis that Mahāyāna formed in South Indian forest dwelling ascetic communities seriously anymore.

The traditional Mahāyāna account however is clear: Mahāyāna was taught by the Buddha, Mahāyāna teachings were preserved by ārya bodhisattvas, and eventually, they were promulgated widely.

The second issue, where I think that Ray is really out to lunch, is his perspective on Hinayāna: what the term means and to whom it applies. The basis of my argument about is the texts of the Mahāyāna tradition itself and the traditions it self-consciously identifies as objects of polemic, Sthaviravāda/Theravada being among them. Then of course there is irrefutable fact that people calling themselves "Theravadins" lay claim to being in fact the Sthaviravada tradition. As I pointed out, either there is a continuity of the Theravadin ordination lineage which goes back to Upali or there is not. If there is, there is no decent reason not to consider Theravada the modern representative of the Sthaviravādin tradition. That being the case, within the literature of the Pali Canon itself, the path of attaining Buddhahood, the practice of a bodhisattva, is nowhere taught. Therefore, in order to practice that path, aspirants must turn to Mahāyāna sūtras if they wish to have any hope of understanding how to practice that path beyond a vague notion.

I did read the text you cite. It was very interesting and I thank you for it. When I said "Theravada was not included by name as one of the 18 schools."  I meant to refer to the early Mahayana polemics, of course, and not to any text at all. That was my error.

Malcolm wrote:
If the Theravādins regard themselves as the heirs of the mantle of the Sthaviravadins, and the Sthaviravadins are explicitly mentioned in early Mahāyāna polemics, when the Ārya Sthaviravadins are mentioned for example, in the Karmasiddhiprakarana, the Tarkajvala, The Yogacarabhumi, the Mahāyānasamgraha [where a passage of theirs is cited concerning the bhavanga citta], or when Vasubandhu mentions the Sthaviravadins in the Vivṛtagūḍhārthapiṇḍavyākhyā (which contains a number of views of various śrāvaka schools) we can understand that this includes Theravada. Therefore, it is disingenuous to imagine that mainland Indian Mahāyānists were unaware of Sthaviravada/Theravada.

Caodemarte said:
It is likely that the Dīpavaṁsa’s account was a portrayal of the situation at the time the Dīpavaṁsa or its sources was composed, when the Sri Lankan Mahāvihāra was in deep and protracted conflict with the Mahāsaṅghika schools. This situation was backdated to the time of the root split, providing mythic authority for the Mahāvihā.

Malcolm wrote:
My reply to this is simple. When we examine the positions of Sthaviravadins that are discussed by Mahāyānists, we find they correspond precisely to ancient, middle as well as modern Theravada positions: for example, the nonexistence of the antarabhāva, the theory of the bhavanga consciousness ( srid pa'i yan lag gi rnam par shes pa ), etc.

And whether or not Theravadins were the REAL heirs to the Sthaviravada, they certainly imagined they were, and held to positions and continue to hold positions which are clearly identified as Sthaviravadin in Mahāyāna polemical texts.

And: Mahāmati, while the abandonment of the afflictive obscuration is not different for śrāvaka [arhats] and pratyekabuddhas because there is only one liberation, they do not abandon the knowledge obscuration.
Mahāmati, the knowledge obscuration is purified by seeing the selflessness in phenomena.
The one thing that never fails to amaze me is the presumption that we know Agamic Buddhism better than those who were raised in it, such as Nāgārjuna, Asanga and Vasubandhu. So when I see objections like yours, Astus, I just have to shake my head.

The pre-Mahāyāna historical traditions such as the Theravāda are far richer, more complex, and more profound than the definition of ‘Hīnayāna’ would allow. ...The term ‘Hīnayāna’ is thus a stereotype that is useful in talking about a particular stage on the Tibetan Buddhist path, but it is really not appropriate to assume that the Tibetan definition of Hīnayāna identifies a venerable living tradition as the Theravāda or any other historical school …"

Such a category can be used to exploit otherwise ordinary stories and claim that arhats are not that perfect. At the same time, similar events in the Buddha's biography can be found as well, but those are explained in a very different light.

But still the source of such ignorance is not explained. Or maybe it's the expectation of fantastic omniscience - beyond what logically can come from clear seeing of appearances - of a buddha that would need to be established. Otherwise, such stories can only fall into the category of parables.

Malcolm wrote:
Uhuh. So basically what you are saying is that if a source does not fit your preconceptions, it is a "parable" and does not conform to your notions of what is "logical."

Glad you have placed it on such a subjective basis.

In short, omniscience is not required for arhatship, indeed, none of the five mundane abhijñās are required. All that is required is that through seeing phenomena through the lens of the four noble truths, one relinquishes all ten fetters. That's all. In the Hināyāna teachings, only a buddha does this in one session, without a teacher to guide them. Arhats have a teacher to guide them, and generally gradually so. However, the same Hinayāna sources note there are severe restrictions on the knowledge of arhats like Maudgalyayāna which do not apply to a buddha.

Malcolm wrote:
This essay depends on acceptance of the idea that there was no Mahāyāna at the time the Buddha was teaching in India. However, as we know, Maitreyanatha states in the Sūtra-alaṃkara that "Mahāyāna arose at the same time," meaning that Buddha taught Mahāyāna during the Early Buddhist period. Not only this, Agamic teachings are explicitly referred to in the Samdhinirmocana sūtra as the first turning of the wheel teachings, where as Mahāyāna teachings are referred to second and third turnings. Thus means that from a Mahāyāna point of view, Mahāyāna teachings existed during the early Buddhist period.

Arhats have ignorance, and this means they possess the knowledge obscuration.
What are they ignorant of? Knowledge obscuration means being bound by the view of grasper and grasped, the concepts of agent, object, and action. They are free from clinging to the five aggregates and the six sensory areas, so there is nobody to grasp anything. What is left then to be obscured by?

Malcolm wrote:

All of the causes 
in a single peacock feather
is not an object of knowledge for the one who is not omniscient, 
but that can be known through the power of omniscience.
Other examples include Śariputra rejecting a candidate for ordination that Buddha later deemed suitable, and so on. These commentaries on the Kośha provide examples extracted from the Agamas which display the non-afflictive ignorance of arhats and pratyekabuddhas.

You believe in none of it. Do you know why the Buddha taught dependent origination, his motivation?  It was to prevent people from asking him who they were in their past lives. So he said instead, based on affliction in a given continuum, there is karma, based on karma there is birth, if affliction is not eliminated, one will engage in karma, and if one engages in karma, suffering will result for that continuum until the end of time.

You believe that when you die, the terminus point of your mind is when your brain is dead. The Buddha described such a point of view as annihilationism (ucchedavāda). You see, there were whole schools of people in iron-age India, not followers of the Buddha, who hold your modern twentieth century belief that when the body dies, the mind dies with it.

All authentic Dharma teachings from Theravada to Dzogchen teach that based on affliction in a given continuum, there is karma, based on karma there is birth; if affliction is not eliminated, one will engage in karma, and if one engages in karma, suffering will result for that continuum until the end of time. The difference between all these schools, from Theravada to Dzogchen lay in the details of how this problem is approached and resolved, not in the essential problem itself.

It is possible to keep buddha-nature with a one-vehicle explanation, where every level is only a stage on the path to buddhahood. And in order to explain the historical problem raised here by many, it can be said that while the Agamas are not at fault or lacking, the way they were interpreted by some is incorrect, thus we see that Mahayana apologetics are against Abhidharmic ideas primarily. Similarly, in Tibetan Buddhism they find the sutra teachings somewhat deficient as they actually view them through a number of treatises (while, for instance in some Mahamudra works quoting sutras that match with the highest teaching is fine).

Malcolm wrote:
Or, the Agamas, as Nāgārjuna says very clearly, do not teach the path to Buddhahood, let alone buddhanature (which itself can only be seen by buddhas).

Mahāyāna sūtras provide details on a path that are not detailed in the Agamas. If they were detailed, the Mahāyāna sūtras would be unnecessary, not to mention the tantras and the Dzogchen tantras, etc.

I notice Dan was making pretty much the same points as I was writing my reply.

I have to add these are typical misrepresentations of the path expounded in early Buddhism. On these gross misunderstandings (most typical in Vajrayana) the Mahayana can't be trusted to define what Theravada is.

Malcolm wrote:

It is not the case that Hinayāna is some monolithic entity when it comes to tenets. However, it is monolithic with respect to its goals, arhatship as opposed to buddhahood. Why? It conceives of buddhahood as being merely a special kind of arhatship, attained by special kind of person, a bodhisattva, who hasn't even an inkling of awakening until his final birth in which he attains buddhahood. A buddha must be a "he," since in all Śrāvakayāna schools there is no chance that a women can become a buddha, even though she can become an arhat.

However, it should also be recognised that the bodhisattva path is more extensive when it comes to other aspects, particularly the ability to teach beings, as that's the main quality a buddha has to possess. And when I say extensive, it doesn't mean one cannot find those qualities in arhats, but they are not requirements.

They basically accept (without any nuance) the Western view that the Buddha's "original" teachings are those contained in the Pali Canon/Agamas. They do not contend the general thrust of Buddhist text critical studies at all. They really have no confidence in Mahāyāna teachings because at the end of the day, they do not believe the Mahāyāna was the Buddha's teaching. For them, there is no issue of whether or not Theravada is Hinayāna because for them there is no Mahāyāna.

Theravada is a śrāvakayāna path.

The question centers not around whether Mahāyāna judgements about Śrāvakayāna paths are valid —— that is an entirely separate question — the question centers around whether the Theravada path matches the criteria set out in Mahāyāna Sūtras for such a path, and the answer, as far as I am concerned, is yes.

The question of superiority or inferiority can only be answered by an analysis of view and practice. In my opinion, the view, meditation and result of Mahāyāna is in every way superior to that of any śravaka school —— but hey, that is just me. Everyone has to come up with that answer based on their own study and practice.

and why would you consider texts that are, by your own admission, "edited, formalized, formatted, sanitized and generally prepared for an audience" authoritative at all? Its not that the sutras are not of interest or don't contain interesting ideas. The problem is when one set of texts are arbitrarily considered "authoritative" then other texts are by definition considered false, mistaken or "provisional". Buddhism is not the only tradition that has wasted time and energy arguing about what is authoritative on arbitrary grounds (usually appeals to mythological sources for the texts). All religious traditions do this. But in the West since the 17th century we have developed the idea of judging ideas on their own merits without appeals to authority. This seems to me to be progress in awakening, which is what Buddhism purports to be the goal. Ironically, even the Buddha is portrayed as discouraging his followers from blind adherence to his teachings and that they should rather test them on their own merits and not simply appeal to authourity.

People are free, and they can make up their own minds, gurus or not.

There is these days a species of Buddhist Correctness however, which misguidedly tries to claim that the path of an arhat is just the same as the path of a bodhisattva, no better, no worse, just "different" (whatever that means) even though Theravadins by and large have abandoned the idea that it is possible to become an arhat — examples of this anecdotally exist in Tibet, where Vajrayāna practitioners who lack Mahāyāna bodhicitta still manage to eliminate their afflictive obscuration.

If the various early canons have all come down to us in fragmentary state, then you would expect a random mix of teachings, both shravaka and mahayana. This is obviously not the case. The pali canon has only non-mahayna sutras. how do you propose to explain this?

As regards Theravada, I've seen precious little understanding of what Theravada does or does not teach here and elsewhere in Mahayana/Vajrayana circles and much misunderstanding. Just like I've seen plenty of misunderstanding of Mahayana/Vajrayana among Theravadins. That's why I suggested earlier in the thread, that if one if genuinely interested in Theravada-related questions, it is best to turn to Theravada sources and teachers.

Malcolm wrote:
Dan, the Theravada teachings are not some mysterious "other." Many of us here have studied Theravadin and other Śrāvakayāna teachings in quite a great bit of detail. Many of us here have read in detail and extensively all the Pali Canon translations that are available both from Bhikku Bodhi and the PTS. The sum total of all classical Theravada meditation practices can be found in the Visuddhimagga, and they are little different than their counterparts in Sarvastivadin Abhidharma. We all share the 37 bodhipakṣa dharmas, the five skandas, the three afflictions, various schemes of dependent origination, and so on. We all share the common ideas about stream entry, etc. So you see, many of us have done our homework and checked into these sources.

The differences lie mainly not between the Sarvastivada and Theravada employment of these key concepts, the difference is that in Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna these ideas are treated a little differently. Nevertheless, Mahāyāna too is grounded in these key concepts.

Another point is that the meditation practice tradition in Theravada is largely reconstituted from books. It was revived, and does not have a living continuous tradition as in Tibetan Buddhism, Zen and so on. Indeed, Theravada for many centuries even seems to have given up the idea that arhatship is possible, though, in the 20th century it appeared that this skepticism was partly reversed. In Mahāyāna, it has never been the case that we have ever given up the idea that awakening and even buddhahood is possible.

The usual contested "misunderstanding" is the Mahāyāna assertion that the path of buddhahood does not exist in the Agamas/NIkayas. Well, it does not. It does not matter if there are such texts as the Buddhavamsa and so on. Texts such as these are hagiographies, not manuals for practice. Mahāyāna sūtras cover many topics, but their central concern is describing the bodhisattva path, which is distinct from the arhat path.

There is another point — anyone who is a Theravadin can follow Mahāyāna by properly taking the bodhisattva vow if they so choose, just as many Mahāsamghikas, Sarvastivādins, Dharmaguptakas, Mulasarvastivadins and so on have. They can also follow Vajrayāna if they so choose. Some people seem to think that Theravada is the only active Śrāvakayāna school left, but it is not true.

Sarvastivada abhidharma ideas, such as the six causes and four conditions actively permeate even Dzogchen teachings. Whole mandalas are constructed on the basis of the thirty-seven bodhisapaksa dharmas, such as the mandala of Cakrasamvara.

Śrāvakayāna teachings form the backbone of Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna, but the goal put forward in those teachings is limited in its scope since they concern only achieving liberation for oneself.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, you do have to bear in mind that Jundo's teacher thinks the goal of seated practice is to cause a spontaneous alignment of the vertebrae of the spinal column resulting in a balanced "body-mind" which, according to him, is the essence of Soto practice. Here is his own summary of his theory of Zazen:
When he was 29 years old he left the palace in search of the meaning of life, and after several years, when he was 35 or 36, after adopting a simple method of physical practice that balanced his body and mind, he discovered what he had been searching for; he found that the world exists just at this time and in this place, and that the whole universe is splendid just as it is. For many years he taught his disciples about the simple practice and what it meant as the essential truth that all human beings should know. Gautama Buddha was not a god, but a man. And he taught that we can all return to our original state, which is serene and peace- ful. His teachings are not spiritual, but essentially humanistic; with this simple practice we can all attain our perfection as hu- man beings.
And:
What do we experience in Zazen?

Zazen is the simplest form of action, and when we are practicing
Zazen we do not intentionally think about anything or concentrate
on our feelings and perceptions. We sit in a simple nondiscriminating
state where our body-and-mind are balanced and
undivided. However, in order to discuss the state in Zazen we
cannot avoid making divisions and categorizations. In spite of
these categorizations, the actual experience of Zazen remains a
wholistic one.

We can describe four aspects in the practice of Zazen. They
are: 1) Different from thinking; 2) Making the body right; 3) Oneness
of body-and-mind; and 4) Oneness with the Universe.

1. Different from Thinking
The state in Zazen is without intention and is different from thinking.
This statement sounds strange as we normally believe that
we are always thinking. We avoid intentionally following a train
of thought during Zazen by concentrating on maintaining the
posture. Of course spontaneous thoughts and images arise in
our consciousness during Zazen, but they are not important.
When we notice that we are thinking about something, we should
simply stop. If we correct our posture, the thought or perception
will disappear and our consciousness will slowly become clear
and we will feel peaceful. In this peaceful and balanced state,
we are in the state that is “different from thinking.”

However, if we intentionally try to attain the state that is different
from thinking, we can never do so. When our consciousness
is full of thoughts and feelings during Zazen, we should
leave our state as it is. Our worries will bubble to the surface
and evaporate into the universe! In this way, by concentrating
on the posture, we will return naturally to our original state
during our practice.

2. Making the Body Right—a Balanced Autonomic Nervous System

In Zazen we sit on a cushion on the floor with both legs crossed,
and with our lower spine, upper spine, and head held straight
vertically. Keeping the spine straight has a direct and immediate
effect on the autonomic nervous system that controls many of
our body’s functions. Its effects include control of heart rate and
force of contraction, constriction and dilatation of blood vessels,
contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle in various organs,
the ability to focus the eyes and the size of the pupils, and the
secretion of hormones from various glands directly into the blood
stream.

The autonomic nervous system is composed of two subsystems:
the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems.
When the sympathetic nervous system is stimulated, our
heart rate increases, arteries and veins constrict, the lungs relax,
and our pupils dilate; in short, we become tense and alert. When
the parasympathetic nervous system is stimulated, the opposite
happens; our heart rate decreases, arteries and veins dilate, the
lungs contract, and the pupils constrict. You can see that the two
systems prepare the body for an active or passive response—
sometimes known as the “fight or flight” syndrome. When the
effect of the two systems on the organs is in balance, we are neither
ready to fight, nor ready to run away; we are in a normal
state.

The parasympathetic nerves emerge from the spinal chord
at the base of the spine (the second, third and fourth sacral vertebrae)
and through the cranial vertebrae in the neck, whereas
the sympathetic nerves emerge from the spinal chord through
the middle vertebrae in the back (the T1 to L2 vertebrae). 
Keeping the spine normally upright, with the
head sitting squarely on the top of the
vertebral column minimizes the compression
of the nerves of these two systems
at the points where the nerves
emerge through the vertebrae,
and ensures an uninterrupted
supply of blood, allowing them
to function normally. When the
parasympathetic and sympathetic
systems are both working
normally, they function in
opposition to give us a state of
balance of body-and-mind; not
too tense, and not too relaxed,
not overly optimistic or pessimistic;
not too aggressive
and not too passive. It is this physical state of balance in the
autonomic nervous system that give rise to what we call a balanced
body-and-mind.

In addition to this, sitting in the upright posture, where the
force of gravity acts down through the spine onto the pelvis, is a
position in which our body’s reflexes can work efficiently to integrate
the functioning of the whole body.

3. Oneness of Body and Mind in the Present Moment
Usually we think there is something that is called “mind” and
something else called “body” and that the two are separate, although
they have a great effect on each other. In Buddhism we
believe that body and mind are two sides of one entity, which
we call “myself,” but that we actually cannot fully grasp. We
believe that every mental phenomenon has a physical side, and
every physical phenomenon has a mental side. We do not believe
in the independent existence of something called “mind”
that is separate from the physical body, brain, nervous system,
and so on. When we sit in Zazen, because we do not concentrate
on thoughts, or perceptions, our body-and-mind exist undivided
in the present moment. When our mind is in the ordinary state
and our autonomic nervous system is balanced, we are in the
“balanced state of body-and-mind.”

4. Oneness with the Universe
When we are practicing Zazen, not only can we say that bodyand-
mind are one; we are also sitting in the state where there is
no distinction between ourselves and the external circumstances—
the world around us. Most people have at some time
experienced this simple feeling of oneness with everything, and
in Zazen we can notice that it is not just a feeling, but the actual
state of things in the present moment. When we are sitting in
Zazen we are one with the Universe, and the state includes all
things and phenomena. In that sense, although we are experiencing
the state, we cannot grasp it intellectually. We cannot
describe it completely. We call the state “ineffable,” or “dharma,”
or “truth,” or “reality.” But even these words are inadequate to
describe the simple and original state that we return to in Zazen.

Theres really no qualitative difference between arguing about which flavor of Buddhism is superior/inferior and being ISIS. Its only a quantitative difference: you use words, ISIS uses guns and bombs.

Malcolm wrote:
There is both a qualitative difference as well as the quantitative difference you mention. The qualitative difference is that no one is suggesting that Śrāvaka schools are peddling something false (that is the what Śrāvaka schools say about Mahāyāna), what is being suggested is that if you want to become a buddha instead of an arhat, you need to follow Mahāyāna because the path for achieving that does not exist in Śrāvakayāna.

Astus said:
It would be possible to point out that Mahayana has a different interpretation of all three of the treasures, so while on the surface they sound the same, they don't mean the same, just like Buddha is the ninth incarnation of God for Vaisnavas. And even if they are the same, it still seems illogical to give any "benefit of doubt", as that would also mean doubting one's own tradition.
However Mahayana sutras are addressed to those embarking on the Bodhisattva path, they're not intended to make sravakas feel bad about themselves. As I already said, these types of things are contextual teaching devices, not proclamations to be heralded on billboards or in a Theravadan forum.
Vimalakirti sutra, ch 3 is a good example of making sravakas feel bad. But if such instances are teaching devices, then there is no discussion of any Hinayana school, only a number of misinterpretations that do not represent any actual doctrine and discipline, therefore it not only has nothing to do with Theravada, but it's not relevant to the Agama scriptures either. Personally, I am sympathetic to that interpretation of the Mahayana supremacist rhetoric, but so far it has not really surfaced in this thread as an option.

SpinyNorman said:
But then a Theravadan probably wouldn't accept the premise that the Theravada path is incomplete.   So again we're back to the problem of subjectivity, one vehicle judging another according to it's own assumptions, and not to any objective standard.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, Theravadins would not accept their path is incomplete, but the ultimate of the lower is the relative of the higher, and from a Mahāyāna point of view the Theravada path, along with the path of the rest of the eighteen schools, is incomplete in that following it will not result in buddhahood.

In other words, for a Mahāyāni, the point of the path is not only personal freedom, but rather it is the attainment of bodhisattva awakening and eventual buddhahood in order to free all sentient beings from suffering. The path laid out in the 18 schools simply does not cover the bodhisattva path.

The Buddha teaches in many sūtras that the arhat path is incomplete and inferior. So, really, it is not Mahāyānis who are making this statement, it is the Buddha.

You may choose not read those sūtras the Buddha taught where he expresses these things, that is your privilege. But in a Mahāyāna forum, one assumes that the Buddha's teaching in Mahāyāna sūtras are the baseline for what is higher and lower, and so on, and in this case, the Buddha in these sūtras clearly lays out which paths lead to which results. Moreover, there is an entire literature explicating in detail the meaning of these issues, authored by Nāgārjuna, Maitreyanatha and their followers, who clearly explain the intent of the Buddha in the Mahāyāna Sūtras. Those are the teachers we follow, and it is their teachings on this matter to which we refer.

In such case, "properly trained" may come down to being the fellow and his interpretation that the speaker happens to believe.

A fascinating book of a few years ago was Richard Shankman's "The Experience of Samadhi", not particularly for the author's personal interpretation, but for the interviews with many experienced and venerated teachers from a variety of lineages (granted, primarily on the Theravada/Vipassana side of things), who agreed on very little in the details.

Malcolm wrote:
Considering that Theravadins completely reconstituted their meditation traditions from books, it is not surprising at all that there are disagreement among them.

Fortunately, in the Tibetan tradition we have a continuous meditation tradition which goes back to Indian Buddhism and its continuities. While there are indeed disagreements over some philosophical issues, there is broad agreement, experientially as well as theoretically, over such issues was what constitutes the first dhyāna and so forth.

I consider that too extreme a view. It is undeniable that not only rebirth but also superpowers have always been very much elements of Buddhism. Seeing them as metaphors and superstitions is failing to understand what they meant to our ancestors and even to many contemporary practitioners. Instead of rejecting them out of cultural habit, there are two important areas where we can practise openness towards initially strange teachings. One is the anthropological and historical approach, considering the role of those teachings in the past. Second is the practical approach, in how we can actually make use of those elements of the path. I think both are possible, interesting and educational.

One could argue that those who reject rebirth aren't Buddhists, but neo-Buddhists. Why? Because they reject the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Noble Truth. Under the materialist view, the origin of suffering is biological birth, and suffering will cease upon death. Accordingly, the Buddhist teachings are at best, merely an early exit from suffering. At worst, they are a complete waste of time.

Rather than spend time on practice, we would be better off spending our time earning money or otherwise making ourselves as comfortable as possible until the liberating moment of death. The quickest and surest path to the end of suffering is not Zen, Vajrayana, Dzogchen, or Mahamudra, but actually a premature death.

It seems like the whole enterprise falls apart without rebirth.

The first section of the Mahāyāna Sūtrālaṃkāra similarly contains a fairly detailed critique of Hināyāna schools and a defense of Mahāyāna.

These are just the treatises involved. In the sūtras themselves the Buddha mentions many reasons why the path taught in the Agamas/NIkayas is incomplete and not the definitive meaning.

Therefore, Open Dharma means that no source whatsoever have primacy. Although in a way that is a straight way to chaos and confusion, it could also mean a 'pure reason' arena, where only the very basics of perception and logic counts. Except that very few, if any, can uphold such argument rules. Still, we can try.

When evidence is provided from Mahāyāna Sūtras and treatises, it is dismissed as invalid. But this is quite ironic — here, in a Mahāyāna forum, evidence from Mahāyāna sūtras themselves are not counted as sufficient evidence for the Mahāyāna position. Amazing and disgusting.

If this is the Open Dharma forum, than this means that it is entirely appropriate for me to post any and all sūtras where Buddha discusses the difference between Hinayāna and Mahāyāna (there are many), as well as any commentaries which are germane to the point.

Further, this agenda of this forum is unfair. The Dhamma Wheel Open Dhamma Forum simple states, "An open and inclusive investigation into Buddhism and spiritual cultivation."

Why should we experience the discrimination of having "The only forum on Dharma Wheel in which all Mahayana teachings are open to challenge. Discuss ‘hot topics’ such as rebirth, karma and differences between schools..."?

Hmmm.. would

appearances be equivalent with the dependent nature
conventions equivalent with illusory nature


In the Yogacara view?

Bakmoon said:
I also would really like to know the answer to this question. The Yogacara teaching of the three natures has always been a bit confusing to me because different sources seem to present them differently (and that's just in a Cittamatra context, not even going into the Shentong version of the three natures).

Mostly I am confused because some sources make it sound like the dependent nature means the appearance of the object and the illusory nature is the designation applied to it, but in other places it sounds like the dependent nature refers to the mind, and the illusory nature is the appearance.

Also, is the idea of mapping the three natures onto the two truths with the illusory nature and dependent nature being subdivisions of conventional truth something that is laid out in Indian texts or is that a latter appropriation?

Malcolm wrote:
Conventions are the imputed nature. Appearances are the imputed nature in the dependent nature.

The mapping of the two truths to the three natures is a Tibetan thing.

There is no mention at all of the the two truths in the three of the five treatises of Maitreya. The two truths are mentioned briefly in the Uttaratantra and once in the Sutra-alamkara. Any discussions about relative and ultimate truth are generally confined to Vasubandhu's Yogacara commentaries, etc., apart from Asanga breifly discussing them in his Uttaratantra commentary.

Basically, it appears that Yogacarins tried to come up with an explanation of emptiness that completely bypasses the idea of the two truths.

This is not an easy question to answer. Take this cup. Lots of appearances--- table, floor, cold feeling, tingling etc., but I select some of them and say "cup." So I can't say the appearance doesn't depend on the convention. On the other hand, if I close my eyes, the cup appearance vanishes, so I can't say that the appearance does depend on the convention.

Even worse, whatever one would call a convention is also an appearance--- a thought or set of thoughts, feelings, etc.

I would reject them both and say interdependent.

Malcolm wrote:
It is pretty clear that conventions depend on appearances. In other words, there has to first be an appearance upon which a convention is settled.

Relative truths are appearances to a misapprehending mind, while conventions are designations made on the basis of appearances.

Thus, when it is said that something exists conventionally, this means no more and no less than a group of people have agreed that a given appearance bears the identity which has been agreed upon. Thus appearances do not depend on conventions, but conventions certainly depend on appearances. As such, they are a step removed from perception. Appearances are perceived, conventions are not, the latter are superimposed on appearances.

- Could you explain the difference here between Tsulug and Phulug ?

Malcolm wrote:
Simply put, they are two different systems of calculating the calendar based on the information in the commentary on the Kalacakra Tantra called Vimalaprabha.

Bonpos indentify three different Kalacakras: the Sūtra Kalacakra found in the Ziji, which I mentioned already, which details the formation of the eon and so forth. The Buddhist Kalacakra Tantra, and finally so called Kalacakra of oral instructions for calculating the years, months, days and hours, which is basically the elemental calculation we know today. In the Bon tradition, the last one was taught in China by the Bon version of Mañjuśrī, Mrawey Sengey, to Kongtse Trulgyal. In the Buddhist tradition, elemental calculation was taught by Mañjuśrī in China to Kongtse Trulgyal. The two systems are so similar, that in the Bonpo astrology manuals, constant reference is made to earlier Buddhist texts, especially a Karma Kagyu text called the Bumzang, which is very popular in Eastern Tibet.

Really, about the only real difference between Bon and Buddhist astrology is the origin myths, and even here, the Bonpos include Sakyamuni as being one of the teachers of Kalacakra in general. A second difference is that the name Kalacakra is applied also to elemental calculation in the Bon tradition, but in the Buddhist tradition, elemental calculation and Kalacakra are regarded as being distinct and as having separate origins.

It means that they followed the Karma Kagyu system of calculating calendars, that's all. It is just a kind of math.

However, putting aside my shorthand summary, some others have spelled out more detailed arguments and evidence against:
If we take that time period back to the aeons of cosmic contraction and expansion, the problems only ramify. Around 700,000 to a million lifetimes and we are into the pre-hominid.

At this point there is certainly no developed language, and the bodhisatta would have had no name. He could only have been one or another variety of animal, but even so, animals only go back about 600-700 million years.

Prior to that it’s not clear the bodhisatta could have been reborn on Earth, at least that would be the case if we assume that only animals have the consciousness available for kamma and rebirth.

Of course, the Buddha could have been reborn on other planes or planets, but once again there is no mention of vast divergences in body plan, language, culture, or surroundings that would indicate such a rebirth. Indeed, the evidence provided in MN 39 is consistent with a world in which humans always existed in a way much as in the Buddha’s own time. If this is evidence for rebirth, it is not very convincing. More convincing would have been some otherwise inexplicable stories about social, linguistic, and morphological change as the Buddha retreated into memories of the distant past.

Now let us go back to the case of young Lama Osel and his predecessor. Although one hypothesis to explain his appearance in Lama Zopa's dream, and his choice of the right rosary, is that he is the reincarnation of Lama Thubten Yeshe, could we not conceive of an alternative hypothesis that would be no less problematic than the theory of rebirth? One has to remember the environment in which Lama Osel has been brought up. From a very early age he has been immersed in images of Lama Yes he and the world of Tibetan Buddhism (like the photo he referred to in the interview), subjected to high-profile media attention because of his having been identified as a tulku, and surrounded by people with a high investment in believing that he is the reincarnation of their teacher. Let us imagine that the child is simply responding to the expectations of the adults around him. He already knows that when he makes certain gestures or speaks in a certain tone of voice, those who care for him will exclaim with joy, "Oh, that's just like Lama Yeshe!" So when this sensitive child is confronted with a range of rosaries, could he not simply be responding to the hopes and expectations of his audience—none of whom are indifferent to the outcome? One wonders if the same tests were run under laboratory conditions in the presence of neutral observers whether the results would be the same.

This is an irrelevant example. Buddha himself never spoke of such an institution of recognizing tulkus, but when Maudgalyayāna inquired of the Buddha where his mother had taken birth, the Buddha was able to answer him.

Thus, the institution of recognizing reincarnations has no bearing on whether or not rebirth is a fact of being a sentient being.

Right, because it comes from the 20th chapter of the Ziji, and this text was a terma not revealed until the 14th century, nearly 400 hundred years after the Kalacakra Tantra was introduced to Tibet.

Hi Malcolm,

I have no trouble with any of this. This is what I teach in our little Sangha.

The only question I hold (and likely share with most skeptics on this issues in the Buddhist world) concerns very detailed models of rebirth in which, once this corpse is dumped in the grave, my soulless stream of Karmic effects comes back as a bunny rabbit, Asura, a god somewhere over Mt. Sumeru (another hard to defend model of reality that Buddhism has pretty much learned to survive without) or a prisoner of the ice hell.

Not important to Practice. Take that or leave that. If I come back as a bunny, please give me a carrot. We are dying and reborn in each moment, and we create endless little heavens and hells for ourselves and for others in this life by our volitional words, thoughts and acts. We need to see through all that, plus through the life and death of the grave. That's enough.

Gassho, Jundo

Malcolm wrote:
There is and only ever has been one model of rebirth in Buddhadharma. You keep conflating cosmology with the principle of punarbhāva, rebirth. The former is not necessary to the latter.

One, in Mahāyāna it is maintained that the three realms are mind only. This includes the six lokas, features such as Mt. Meru and so on, including the perception you have of your own sense organs, body and so on. According to Mahāyāna, all of these perceptions and experiences arise from traces activated in the all-basis consciousness.

Now that we have removed physicality and cosmology from the equation, we can understand that the apparent death of our physical body is not a death of a physical body, rather it is the cessation of the perception of a physical body we have now and in this life time. But given that we accept, as Mahāyānists, that all phenomena are only mind, the exhaustion of this life's appearances do not preclude the arising of the appearance of a new series of aggregates to our consciousness, whether or not we have any memory of a past life.

Descarte had it wrong, there is no demon in the mix; but there are afflictions in the mix, and for as long as the traces of those afflictions contaminate our minds streams, then for us there is no end to birth and death.

Heart Sutra:

No old age and death, no [start nor] cessation of old age and death [because empty]

Vimalakirti Sutra

"The Dharma knows nothing of living beings, because it is removed from the defilement of such concepts as "living beings." The Dharma knows nothing of "I," because it is removed from the defilement of such concepts as "I." It knows nothing of a life span, because it knows nothing of birth and death. It knows nothing of individuality, because it is cut off from considerations of past or future lives. The Dharma is forever still and serene, because it has wiped out all characteristics.

...

Shariputra said to the goddess, "When your present existence comes to an end, where will you be reborn?"
The goddess replied, "The way the Buddha is born in his transformation body-that's how I'll be born."
Shariputra said, "When the Buddha is born in his transformation body, it is not a matter of birth or death.
The goddess said, "It's that way with living beings too-they are without birth or death."

...
The bodhisattva Good Will said, "The realm of birth and death and that of nirvana form a dualism. But if one sees the true nature of birth and death, one sees that there is no birth or death, no binding, no unbinding, no birth, no extinction. One who understands in this way may thereby enter the gate of nondualism.

...

Again, the sutras enable one to practice the teachings as the Law directs, to accord with the twelve-linked chain of causation, to set aside erroneous views and accept the truth of birthlessness, to realize once and for all that there is no ego, no existence of living beings, no deviating from or disputing with the law of cause and effect, thus removing all thought of personal possession. They teach one to rely on meaning, not on words; to rely on wisdom, not on consciousness; to rely on sutras that are complete in meaning, not on those that are incomplete in meaning; to rely on the Law, not on the person; to go along with the true form of things, realizing that there is no entering in and no destination. They teach that, since ignorance in the end does not exist, so too action in the end does not exist, and so on through the other links in the twelve-linked chain of causation down to the fact that, since birth in the end does not exist, so too old age and death in the end do not exist. And when one learns to see in this manner, the twelve-linked chain of causation will cease to have any form that comes to an end, and one will no longer entertain the view that it does. This is called the finest of all offerings of the Law'"

Surangama Sutra
While the (illusory) knower became a living being.í This is the origin of a living being.
Ever after, this living being grasped at his body and mind as his Ego. How then can he now
recognize his (essential) boundless True Mind? So in delusion, he thinks that his mind is in his
body. Since ‚nanda clung to a mind within his body, he mistook this (illusory) mind for True Mind;
hence he saw only the Buddhaís excellent characteristics which he admired but failed to realize that
neither body nor mind exist. As he relied on the five aggregates, he divided them wrongly into six
sense organs with corresponding sense data. He further clung to the four elements that produced
five sense data as his Egoís fields of activities, thereby (creating) six consciousnesses and indulging
in discriminations, illusions and karmic acts.
This was the origin of the cycle of births and deaths caused by attachment to body and mind
as an Ego.
...
ë‚nanda, you are still not clear about the illusory appearances
of all passing phenomena which vanish wherever
they arise. These illusions in the shape of forms spring from
(their underlying nature which is) the substance of wonderful
Bodhi. So also are the six entrances (organs), the twelve
‡yatana (six sense organs and six sense data) and the eighteen
realms of senses which falsely arise from the mixture
and union of causes and conditions and which falsely vanish
when the same causes and conditions are disconnected.
They are but creation and destruction appearing and vanishing
within the permanent, wonderfully bright, immutable,
all-embracing and profound Bhåtatathat‡ (absolute) nature
of the Tath‡gata store wherein neither coming nor going,
neither delusion nor enlightenment, and neither birth nor
death can be found.5
The Korean Son Teacher Chinul:
: Birth and death are originally nonexistent; they exist because of a
false notion. It is like a person with diseased eyes who sees flowers in the
sky. If a person without this disease says there are no flowers in the sky, the
afflicted person will not believe it. But if his disease is cured, the flowers in
the sky will vanish naturally and he can then accept that they were nonexistent.
Although the flowers he sees have not yet vanished, they are, in fact,
still void. It is only the sick man who takes them to be flowers; their essence
does not really exist.

In the same way, people wrongly assume that birth and death exist. If a
man free of birth and death tells them that birth and death are originally
nonexistent, they will not believe him. But one morning,if c.ielusion is put to
rest, and birth and death are spontaneously abandoned, they will realize
that birth and death are originally nonexistent. It is only when birth and
death are not yet ended that, although they do not really exist, they seem to
exist because of this false conceptualization. As a sutra says:
Men of good family! Since time immemorial all sentient beings have been subject
to all kinds of inverted views. They are like people who have confused the four
directions. They wrongly assume that the four elements are their own bodies.
They regard the shadows conditioned by the six sense-objects as their own'minds.
This is like diseased eyes which see flowers in the sky. Yet even if all the flowers in
the sky were to vanish from space, it still could not be said that they actually
vanished. And why is this? Because they never came into existence in the first
place. All sentient beings mistakenly perceive an arising and a ceasing within this
non-rising state. For ,this reason, it is called the revolving wheel of birth and
death."
According to the text of this sutra, we can be sure that if we have a penetrating
awakening to the true mind of complete enlightenment, then, as originally,
there is no birth or death.
We know now that there is no birth and death; but still we cannot liberate
ourselves from birth and death because our practice is imperfect. As it says
in the texts, Ambapali once asked Maiijusrf, "I can understand that birth is
actually the unborn dharma, but why then am I still subject to the flow of
birth and death?" Maiijusrf answered, "It is because your power is still insufficient."
The mountain master Chin asked the mountain master Hsiu, "I
understand that birth is actually the unborn dharma, but why am I still subject
to the flow of birth and death?" Hsiu replied, "Bamboo shoots eventually
become bamboo. But can you use them now to make a raft?"" Accordingly,
to know that there is no birth or death is not as good as to experience
that there is no birth or death. To experience that there is no birth or death is
not as good as to be in conformity with the birthless and the deathless. To be
in conformity with the birthless and the deathless is not as good as to make
use of the birthless and the deathless. People nowadays do not even know
that there is no birth or death, let alone experience, be in conformity with,
or make use of the birthless and the deathless. Is it not only natural, then,
that people who assume there really is birth and death would not be able to
believe in the birthless and deathless dharma?

Malcolm wrote:
As I said, the first step is to see whether or not Theravada fulfills the criteria that the Mahāyāna lays out for what a Hinayāna path might look like.

This can be evaluated in two ways:

1) There are two results to which one can aspire in Buddhadharma, arhatship and buddhahood. The path of arhatship, as everyone knows, does not lead to buddhahood. The bodhisattva path does lead to buddhahood.

2) It is claimed that the bodhisattva path is superior to the arhat path because the former results in buddhahood while the latter does not.

The Agama/Nikāya sutras teach only the arhat path. The principles of the bodhisattva path are not taught not in those sūtras, as observed by Nāgārjuna in the Ratnavali. Only Mahāyāna sūtras teach the bodhisattva path.

For example, as I mentioned before, if you take the bodhisattva path, according to Theravada ideas, you cut yourself off from the possibility of stream entry, and thus, if you elect to follow the bodhisattva path, you are barred from the basic fruits of the path for eons, until you achieve full buddhahood. Therefore, as a regular person, it is indeed important to know the differences in presentation between Mahāyāna and Śravakayāna schools like Theravada concerning such things the path and so on so one can make an informed choice.

It is just not the case at all that the paths of all common people are alike in every respect.

I've been away so long that I feel that I should re-introduce myself. Due to the loss of loved ones and experiencing the daily and increasing suffering of my best friend, I spent the last three years pretty much in a dark hole, with lots of doubt, anger, experimentation, far too much intellectualization, self-pity and other very ugly sentiments. Through it all, thankfully, I have managed to hold on to my own daily Dzogchen and Mahamudra practices, even though I had hardly any contact with my teachers or dharma centers during this time. In a sense I feel that I could have dealt with this better, in another odd sense I however also sense some big breakthrough, some bigger understanding of many things.

The question here is not really whether Theravada is superior or inferior. The question is whether it is fair to include Theravada among the schools counted as "Hinayāna" in Indian Mahāyāna polemical literature.

Caodmarte's contention is that it is anachronistic to make this claim because, according to him, Theravada did not exist to be a butt of those critiques. Of course, this contention is false, since the rise of Theravada coincides with the rise of Mahāyāna. The earliest self-conscious use of the term we know of is in the Dīpavamsa where Theravada is identified as one of the 18 schools.

There is a prevailing BC attitude where it is considered wrong to include Theravada among the other schools classically identified in Mahāyāna polemical writings as Hināyāna. My point is that this attitude is wrong. Anyone who belongs to any ordination lineage [of the three remaining] can be a Mahāyānist providing they reject certain points of view of the bodhisattva path which are shared among all eighteen schools, and accept the Mahāyāna account of the bodhisattva path in their stead since the two perspectives about this are mutually exclusive.

There are many different teachings for people of many different capacities in Buddhadharma.

Theravada Buddhists say that Mahayana Buddhists say that Theravada in an inferior vehicle, and that Theravadins are selfish or lacking in compassion. How well does this idea match the views of the Mahayana Buddhists on this forum? I don't feel like it's inferior; the best path is whatever you are drawn to. There may be Mahayana sutras which extravagantly expound that Hinayana is lesser, but I would be surprised and confused to go to a dharma talk and hear a Mahayana teacher give a whole lecture about how Mahayana is better than Theravada. There are also texts that say the Buddha cut off his flesh as a bodhisattva, but that doesn't mean Mahayanis like to cut off their flesh. So, when Theravada Buddhists say this I sort of feel like it's a sound bite and stereotype.

Although phrased rather dramatically by Kalupahana (one of the giants of Buddhist studies), it is quite reasonable to argue that the ideas of the Mulamadhyamakakarika were in no way meant to be or seen to be revolutionary in any way, but were natural expressions of (or mild natural developments of) early Buddhist thought.  It is almost certain that Nagarjuna would not have thought of himself as a Mahayanist although claimed as such after his death (reminds me of the truism that Jesus was not a Christian), but rather as a Buddhist intellectual expounding the orthodox wisdom of his day against those whose views had strayed into heretical error inconsistent with Buddhist thought. Of course, it is very difficult, if not flat out impossible, to believe that Nagarjuna or later Theravada or Mahayana Buddhist thinkers would have said anything that they thought contradicted orthodox early Buddhist thought.

Malcolm wrote:
Clearly Nāgārjuna thought of himself as a Mahāyānist, just read the Mahāyāna Vimsika, the Ratnavali, or the Surhleka.

Just as clearly, Kalupahana's treatment of the MMK is severely flawed by his refusal to use the Indian commentarial tradition, and reading passages in direct opposition to what that maintains, breaking up the question and answer format of the MMK. For example, on egregious error DK makes is that he asserts that Nāgārjuna does not reject the four conditions outlined by the Sarvastivadins, the latter embraces them. There are many other interpretive mistakes that DK makes.

Caodemarte said:
Studies on comparative subjects like the Bodhisattva concept in Mahayana and in Theravada (yes, there is a bodhisattva concept in Theravada) have greatly increased our understanding of both Mahayana and Theravada as well as the deep connections between them.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course there is a bodhisattva concept in Theravada, just as there is one in all the Hinayāna schools. For example, the Abhidharmakosha narrates the career of the bodhisattva at the end of one chapter. It is exists in Hinayāna schools because Buddha was once a bodhisattva. But their concept could not be more different than the Mahāyāna ideal.

But this is not the issue before us. The issue is: is there anything which exempts Theravada from Mahāyāna polemics which were aimed at its forbears? The answer is no. There nothing doctrinally unique about Thervavada, as opposed to Sarvastivada, which renders it immune to inclusion among the Hinayāna schools.

There is however these days a BC (Buddhist Correctness) movement to try and pretend that Theravada does not belong to the Hinayāna schools based on some putative idea that since it was outside the main stream developments in India, it is also somehow outside these criticisms. Nothing could be further from the truth. The very ideas put forth in the Abhidhammapitika, the realism of the Visuddhimagga, etc., are exactly the targets of Mahāyāna theoretical polemicists like Nāgārjuna.

One, Hinayāna schools are defined by ordination lineage. Second, any person of any ordination lineage may adopt Mahāyāna, but all the eighteen schools and their offshoots are by definition Hinayāna schools because they favor pursuit of the arhat path over pursuit of full Buddhahood.

I already gave my definition of a Hinayāna practitioner above, i.e., someone who chooses arhatship over full Buddhahood. There are a number of other criteria, but the latter is the most important.

For example, while many people make much noise about the fact that indeed one can adopt the bodhisattva path in Theravada (as well as the rest of the Nikāya/Agamic schools), the barriers to doing so are no different than the barriers and conditions laid down in the Abhidharmakosha for someone who wishes to take up the bodhisattva path (must be male, must have been predicted by the Buddha during his lifetime, etc.). Such people are further barred from stream entry, etc. In other words, while compassion may not be lacking in the Theravada path, bodhicitta is.

Caodemarte said:
I doubt anyone would claim Theravada was immune from criticism. However, there is no evidence that Theravada was one of the traditional 18 schools (or the 17 to 19 if you count differently).

It is often claimed by non-scholars in Theravada countries (Sri Lankans seem big on this) that Theravada is a direct descendant of Sthaviravada (both names mean the same thing). However, when you probe this it comes down to at best, "inspired" by Sthaviravada. Theravadins assume that Sthaviravada was the oldest Buddhist school and therefore assume it must be the most correct and therefore must have taught Theravada  since Theravada is correct (all this may be true but is hardly an historical or convincing argument to non-Theravadins) . It is akin to the claim that Theravada started at the 1st Council. Since this is impossible the claim becomes the more historical idea that the 1st council and what Theravada "reformers" thought was taught served as a distant inspiration, apparently primarily because  the Theravada "reformers" had an  interpretation of what happened which agreed with Theravadin theories!

"There is no historical evidence that the Theravada school arose until around two centuries after the Great Schism which occurred at the Council of Pataliputra" (Oxford Dictionary of Buddhism, 2003). To claim that they are the descendants of Sthaviravada is similar to claims you occasionally read that Sri Lanka has always been a Theravada country (which is true if you ignore the Tantric monuments and other obvious historical evidence!). But even that date is controversial and is probably too early.

So if you want to criticize Theravada (a school with many traditions, but let's treat it as a more or less coherent unit for our purposes) as a Hinayana school using your definition of what that means  you will first have to understand what a Theravadin would describe as Theravadin goals and what is meant by "arhathood" and Buddhahood by the tradition. This is an immense task, but you simply can't claim with intellectual honesty that they believe what a far-distant critic or a 19th Century Western scholar outside the tradition with no direct knowledge asserts they believe unless we are doing simple sect bashing.   Then you can see how they contrast or share points with the Mahayana. For example, you have written  they were "influenced by Nāgārjuna." Although I don't think  Kalupahana would quite agree on who influenced who when, he argues that the Mahayana concept of emptiness and the Theravadin no-self, no substance are extremely similar, if not developments of the same idea in different language. There has been a lot of fascinating recent work on this topic.

Malcolm wrote:
You should read more carefully. I said that some modern Theravadins have been very influenced by Nāgārjuna.

That aside, Thervada subscribes to a Nikāya model of Buddhadharma. This makes them a Hinayāna school by definition.

From a Mahāyāna point of view, the Theravada claims about the nature of Buddhahood and the nature of Arhatship really are no different than what can be found in the Pali Canon's Katthavatthu, etc.

Although there are varying definitions, it is clear that the term was very definitely applied to schools as a criticism, 17 to 19 specific schools by name,if memory serves.  Theravada was not among the targeted schools as it did not exist at the time. In modern times Theravada has been misidentified  being one of these specific schools or incorrectly categorized as holding the beliefs, as defined by ancient Mahayana critics, of one or another of the extinct schools. The question as to how Theravada as a school is fundamentally different in goals or philosophical beliefs from Mahayana in other than lineage and history is a surprisingly difficult and subtle question as Kalupahana and others kept and keep pointing out.

Malcolm wrote:
Umm, this is not correct. Theravada is the descendent of Sthaviravādas, which itself is a descendent of Vibhayavādins.

The positions that modern day Theravadins hold, apart from where they are influenced by Nāgārjuna, are not significantly different than the positions held in the Katthavattu and so on. Claiming therefore that Theravadins are exempt from Mahāyana criticisms is flaw in thinking. In reality, Theravadins are one of the so called eighteen schools, as they count their ordination lineage from Upali.

So the the short answer is no. You or I can certainly be inferior or selfish. But then we would not be good practitioners of any form of Buddhism!

This all probably comes from the misidentification of the Theravada with Hinayana. Hinayana comes the early polemical wars in early Indian Buddhism and was a put down by Mahayanists of an attitude or a whole sect. The schools it was used against died out as did the polemics  before Theravada came to be and I don't believe it was ever applied to (what became) Theravada in India.  Western scholars originally thought Theravada was one of the old, extinct schools  and that is  how why introduced Theravada to the West (and to Japan) as Hinayana Buddhism in modern times. A lot of that got channeled back to Theravada countries and early modern Thai Buddhist writers would say we must be Hinayana. No one believes that now and Hinayana is applied to an attitude, regardless of sect, and not to a contemporary group.

Malcolm wrote:
Hinayāna applies specifically to the goal of attaining an Arhat's cessation, rather than a school. So you do the math. What is the primary goal of a Theravadin? If it is not full Buddhahood, than that practitioner has a Hinayāna motivation.

By inference, schools which do not advocate the attainment of full Buddhahood as a goal are Hinayāna no matter when they existed or in what country.

Actually, Malcolm's critiques are more or less in line with those of Ju Mipham, who was a student of Kongtrul. Mipham rejects affirming negations and considers Longchenpa a Prasangika who likewise upholds the supremacy of non-affirming negations. Mipham's critiques are often squarely leveled at how Dolpopa constructs and separates his two truths, and not just the three natures. Mipham is no slouch, so I don't think he was just wiping away the distinction, but arrived at his conclusions carefully.

Don't take anyone else's word for Kongtrul's opinions on this or any matter.  Look for yourselves.  If I have misrepresented him, you can see it for yourself.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, this is indeed Kongtrul's opinion, no one disputed that this was his opinion. What is under dispute is whether his opinion about Longchenpa is correct. I don't think that it is, and I think there is ample internal evidence in Longchenpa's writings that he was not a gzhan stong pa. As we have already seen, he identifies Candrakirtī has the one who holds the definitive view of Madhyamaka on page 798 of the grub mtha' mdzod. He declares on pg. 821, in the section devoted to explicating Candrakīrti's perspective:
This principle is the pinnacle of all views of the vehicle of causal characteristics.
It is simply inconsistent to maintain that someone who clearly articulates that the pinnacle of cause vehicles views is Prasangika belongs to the gzhan stong persuasion. Longchenpa does state on page 900 that:

In response to including the needs of those of lower intelligence, this garbha is empty because it is empty of faults, conditioning and so on, but it is not an emptiness that discards the phenomena of its qualities, as already mentioned:
The characteristic of distinction is
is that the element is empty of the temporary [afflictions],
the characteristic of the absence of distinction
is not being empty of unsurpassed phenomena.
The pure element that has the nature of the limit of reality is unconditioned like space. The happiness and suffering of samsara (supported on karma and affliction) appear like clouds. Moreover, the suffering because of improper afflicted mental activity is like a cloud. Since karma appears without any nature, it is like the aspect of a dream. The aggregates generated by karma and affliction are explained to be like illusions and clouds to remedy the grasping to one extreme of clinging to self. After that, since there arise five faults of clinging to the reifications of grasping to extremes in emptiness, in order to remove that, the tathagātagarba is explained...."

But frankly, the above statement by Longchenpa is simply not sufficient to place him in the gzhan stong camp, especially with reference to his declaration of the definitive Mahāyana view above, and in light of the fact that he clearly indicates the purpose of the tathagatagarbha view is to make the Mahāyāna path acceptable to those of lesser intelligence.

What is the source for these four logical reasons for future reincarnation?
The first and second sound slightly dubious. In the Sutra of the Seedling of Rice Maitreya says that a small cause can give a large result, like from a small seed a great tree grows. Is this a cause of the similar type or not? A seed is not a tree.
In the process of Dependent Arising name and form are preceded by ignorance, karma formations and consciousness, which are very different in character from a material body.
Ignorance etc.. do not constitute a substantial cause.
There is no substantial cause in Buddhism, for the arising of Samsara, the Wheel of Life.

Of course when the mandala is created, one is a deity within that mandala. Seems to be congruent with what you said about viewing wisdom as something to be attained.

You've probably described all of this on this forum several times before. Thanks for your patience. I'm pretty confident  this doesn't actually contradict what my teacher said.

If we are practicing a sadhana Ati yoga style, we don't even bother visualizing anything, we recite the words, knowing that just thinking about the deity is sufficient, there is no need to meditate on it, and then we recite the mantra resting in our natural state, which is all the deity is anyway.

tomamundsen said:
OK, I wasn't being specific enough. It wasn't taught that there is a being that is "invoked into" oneself in some kind of physical sense. But it was taught that the wisdom being is real, at least as real as we are.

The wisdom being is real in so far as it is symbol of your own innate wisdom which was awoken through the process of the descent of the blessing in the first part of the empowerment rite.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, you create yourself in the form of deity X, and then you activate your own wisdom by summoning the wisdom being as a symbol of that innate wisdom that was pointed out to you during the empowerment. You are not summing deity X from outside to come into you in real sense.

tomamundsen said:
I don't think that necessarily means "invoked into" like what you're saying here. It would mean that one is training to view themselves as inseparable from the deity. And at some levels of practice, we start out from a view where the deity is separate from us and then transition toward the view of union.

Malcolm wrote:
The view that deity is separate from us is the view of kriya, where we practice with the deity before us and slightly higher than we are. Otherwise, the view of yoga tantra is that when we are finished with our practice, the wisdom being is dismissed since in post-equipoise we are engaging in impure activities. In higher tantra, since we are never separate from our innate wisdom, the nature of our minds, we remain in the form of the deity 24/7/365.

tomamundsen said:
From a higher view, there is no separation at all from the beginning and there would effectively be no "merging" at all.

Malcolm wrote:
In the practice of Mahāyoga, there is still a summoning of the wisdom being, because there is still an idea that wisdom, even though it is innate, is something to attain. In Anuyoga there is no summoning of the wisdom being because it is understood that the wisdom being and commitment being have always been inseparable as the basis and are nothing other than the basis.

What is novel is your idea that gzhan stong is merely concerned with explicating the teachings of the Uttaratantra, but this perspective is incredibly anachronistic and wrong headed as we can see from the historical progression of the master who gave gzhan stong its foundation [Dolbupa] and the various scholars who followed his lead.

FWIW, I point out the following passage from "The Crystal and the Way Of Light": There are eight principal classes of Guardians each with many subdivisions. Some are highly realized beings, others not realized at all. Every place - every continent, country, city, mountain, river, lake or forest - has its particular dominant energy, or Guardian, as have every year, hour and even minute: these are not highly evolved energies. The various teachings all have energies which have special relationships with them: these are more realized Guardians. These energies are iconographically portrayed as they were perceived when they manifested to masters who had contact with them, and their awesome power is represented by their terrifyingly ferocious forms, their many arms and heads, and their ornaments of the charnel ground. As with all the figures in tantric iconography, it is not correct to interpret the figures of the guardians as merely symbolic, as some Western writers have been tempted to do. Though the iconographic forms have been shaped by the perceptions and culture of those who saw the original manifestation and by the development of tradition, actual beings are represented.

In a nutshell the question is: Does the ultimate nature of the deity negate its relative nature, and therefore make faith unnecessary?

Malcolm wrote:
This question is a non-sequitar. First of all, there is no ultimate "deity" — if it has hands, colors, eyes, legs, a torso, etc., it is something relative. If you are referring to the continuum of a bodhisattva like Mañjuśrī, it is not something which exists in one place that can be summoned to another place.

Secondly,  Mañjuśrī's continuum cannot displace your own, no matter how hard you try to practice divine pride. But with practice, your continuum can become the same as Mañjuśrī's continuum, and depending on your chosen vehicle, with more or less effort.

And, the higher up you go in the yānas, more and more emphasis is placed on personal experience and direct perception, and increasingly less is placed on testimony and inference.

My personal opinion is that since Ati yoga places the most emphasis on personal experience and direct perception it is the best vehicle for westerners, among all the available Vajrayāna options. But that is just my orientation. Other people like imagining themselves as this and so on



And that is all well and good, very excellent paths, very excellent practices, all practiced with full attention and carefully can result in Buddhahood in a single lifetime, but Dzogchen is still faster and more direct...

Malcolm wrote:
First of all, Ray is not an authority I would turn to.

Second, your definition of faith has nothing at all to with Vajrayāna practice. Faith here means simply that one has to be confident in the teacher and their teachings, thats all. It does not mean that one has to believe the sun shines from their keister. It is not a heavy emotional charge.

Śraddha, which is often translated as faith, is defined in Abhidharma as the mental factor which brings clarity to the mind, and that is it. It is quite a bit different than the faith being extolled  here by smcj.

Śraddha is a path dharma [part of the 37 adjuncts to awakening], one of the five powers and the five strengths — in other words, it is only relevant to our confidence in the path, and it has nothing do with believing in ghosts, goblins, etc., including any and all supernatural powers of buddhas, bodhisattvas, siddhas, and dakinis. The existence or nonexistence of these phenomena are irrelevant to our progress on the path, and there is no way in which our belief or disbelief in them affects our path at all. The only "supernatural" things we need to accept are rebirth and karma, since without these, the path taught by the Buddha makes no sense at all.


Punya said:
Inspired by another thread, it would interesting to explore, in a respectful way, what faith means in a general buddhist sense and in the different traditions (leaving aside the specific topic of guru yoga). These dictionary definitions seem like a reasonable starting point:

1. complete trust or confidence in someone or something
2. strong belief in the doctrines of a religion, based on spiritual conviction rather than proof.

It seems like you would need some faith in the begining as a dharma student or is it just that you just need an open mind and an acceptance that you don't have a complete understanding yet? What does spiritual conviction mean?

And, if you accept the advice of teachers like HH the Dalai Lama about the complexity of karma, and you content yourself with a more basic understanding, is that just accepting it on faith. (There are more than enough threads here on karma so please confine the discussion to the faith aspect).

Right. That's why earlier I made the point that in Christianity the objective is faith and in Vajrayana the prerequisite is faith. The Path starts there, but you've got to follow up with practice. That is very different than dismissing faith entirely.
Buddha wanted people to see for themselves.
Yes. However in the Vajrayana, until such time as they can see for themselves they must initially rely on faith. With realization direct knowledge replaces any need for faith. Someone who has realized the Dharmakaya has no need for faith at all.

Malcolm wrote:
This is not at all true. The Buddha began all his teachings with something that everyone can see without having faith at all. Sarva dukkham, all is suffering.

In Buddhadharma we do not go from lack of knowledge to knowledge, we go from verifiable knowledge to verifiable knowledge.

The message of Dzogchen teachings is that one can have direct knowledge of one's primordial state, aka the basis, long before one can speak of realizing dharmakāya -- this direct knowledge is made into the path.

We don't need to fully realize the dharmakāya. We just need to have personal experience of the positive benefits of the Dharma, then we don't need "faith" because we have experience.

In any case, you are asking the wrong question; it is not about the material world, per se. It would seem to be about the conditioned vs. the unconditioned. However, we don't take refuge in space or cessation, so it is not a question of conditioned vs. the unconditioned.

In Dzogchen, for example, one goes for refuge in one's own knowledge, i.e., rang rig la skyab su mchi'o or something to this effect is very common in Anuyoga level sadhanas.

The real refuge is realization. When one begins to experience the positive effects of the Dharma in one's life, then one can have increased confidence in the Buddha's realization, and thus his Dharma. But the Buddha never wanted anyone to merely have blind faith and leave it at that. Buddha wanted people to see for themselves.

No, because in my own lifetime I have observed a reduction in my obscurations through practicing the Dharma, which has resulted in a clearer appreciation of the things the Buddha has taught.

Even if your main practice and modality is Dharma, i still think there's space for the Christian /Abrahamic pantheon [aswell as  'extraterrestrials'] within Buddhist cosmology. If one can believe in Indra and the possibility of god and deva beings , the idea of Archangels doesn't seem so far-fetched.  Sure, they may also be embedded within samsara to some extent.

I suppose the cosmology of the 6 realms and the various kinds of beings your average practitioner has no perception of, may be one of those 'unseen' aspects that westerners reject in your view smcj?

Malcolm wrote:
SMCJ seems to be arguing for some emotive kind of faith, a bhakti approach, tears streaming, etc. While such descriptions are certainly to be found in every description of Guru Yoga in traditional manuals, reading them over and over again in a hundred manuals, one comes to understand that these are literary themes meant to instill the point that we should feel deep gratitude to our gurus. It certainly does not mean that everytime we think of our teacher we should be overwhelmed with emotions.

To illustrate my point further, most of the Tibetan teachers I have come into contact with deride the faith of simple Tibetans as being grounded in ignorance. They understand that kind of faith will never win with Western Buddhists who have a four hundred year history of the Enlightenment, and who, because of our vastly superior educational opportunities in the West, are never going to believe in Meru Cosmology merely because some teacher insists that we must.

We do not live in a world with a Christian worldview anymore, despite smcj's insistence that all problems Western Buddhists face is our rejection of Christianity [or in my case, an utter lack of interest and connection with it], we live in a world dominated by a scientific worldview, with all of the faults and qualities inherent to it.

Buddha's message is still "come and see for yourself." The further we get away from that message, the further away we get from the Dharma.

Some dharmapālas, such as Mahākāla also double as yidams, that is, they can be practiced as both depending on context and need.

Wisdom dharmapālas are considered dharmapālas who are on the pure bodhisattva stages. Worldly dharmapālās are those who are not on the bodhisattva stages at all. The latter are generally powerful beings of the preta class who have been bound to the Dharma as losers in a conflict with a mahāsiddha such as Padmasambhāva. They frequently need to be reminded of their vows.

Vasana said:
SMCJ , there are different kinds of faith.

"There are different levels of faith. First, “clear faith” refers to the joy and clarity and change in our perceptions that we experience when we hear about the qualities of the Three Jewels and the lives of the Buddha and the great teachers. “Longing faith” is experienced when we think about the latter and are filled with a great desire to know more about their qualities and to acquire these ourselves. “Confident faith” comes through practicing the Dharma, when we acquire complete confidence in the truth of the teachings and the enlightenment of the Buddha. Finally, when faith has become so much a part of ourselves that even if our lives were at risk we could never give it up, it has become “irreversible faith.” - Dilgo Khyentse Rinpoche  from the book "The Excellent Path to Enlightenment: Oral Teachings on the Root Text of Jamyang Khyentse Wangpo

Irreversible faith is more akin to complete confidence free of any doubts as apposed to any kind of blind-faith or unconditioned trust in something one has no personal certainty in.[ but holds faith in none-the-less]  When faith is irreversible, it's more akin to knowledge.

Devotion for the Guru can also arise in conjunction with confidence in the reasoning ,logic and direct-cognition of the dharma as one knows that the outer-guru is the living link for realizing the ultimate-guru. It can also be a method of practicing or emulating pure-perception which will in turn eventually leads to effortless and actual pure-perception/realization.

At this point it's not really the same as the devotion or 'clear-faith' we find at the beginning of the path before any direct-perception of one's nature has occurred.

By that I assume he meant that having a direct experience of the deity can be so startling that it can precipitate a fear response if it is thought of as something other than one's own nature.

With that type of understanding you can see how saying that a deity is of the same nature as your own mind does not nullify the need for faith while doing deity practice.

Just to be clear, my thesis is as Matt J said: On the other hand, the gzhan stongpas have a good explanation for how Buddhahood is both uncreated and "positive." If I'm understanding correctly, the gzhan stongpas would say that once the obscurations are removed, then the virtues of Buddhahood naturally manifest. So from that POV, compassion is natural while greed, hatred, and delusion are distortions based on ignorance. Once the distorting influences are removed, then compassion and so forth would come forth naturally and effortlessly.
Thus an intellectual understanding of Shentong can give the intellect an opportunity to let go of intellectuality.

No, it is necessary to get past intellectualism and proceed with direct perception, that is the main point. There are two ways to approach that, the upāyamarga and mokṣamarga, i.e., the paths of method and liberation respectively. The former depends on  empowerment, and the two stages; the latter depends in direct introduction — but the main point is illustrated in the following way. In sūtra — and this applies to gzhan stong as much as anything else — the understanding of dharmatā is like a painting of a moon. The understanding of dharmatā in the path of method is like seeing a moon in the water. The understanding of dharmatā in the path of liberation is like looking at the moon directly from the start.

Since gzhan stong is principally a sūtrayāna tenet, it requires a lot more faith. The teaching of sugatagarbha,for example, exists to remove five faults, it does not however mean that faith in sugatagarbha constitutes entering the path.

As such it is 100% valid to use the term when if it is explained to be as used by a major author such as Dudjom R. In his "Big Red Book",

Right?

Malcolm wrote:
The first Tibetan to use the term was Kawa Paltseg, ninth century, and he used it refer to the Madhyamaka that was based on freedom from all extremes. More or less everyone had this usage until Dolbupa gummed up the works in the 14th century with his brand new "Uma chenpo."

Because of the popularity of Trungpa, when he introduced the gzhan stong/rang stong distinction in his seminaries, the term "Great Madhyamaka" became associated in western minds with gzhan stong. This was further reinforced by Hookham's book and by the Big Red Book, accompanied by a fairly aggressive campaign to promulgate gzhan stong as an alternative to Gelug Madhyamaka.

I am not arguing that the view of Dzogchen is gzhan-stong, or that there is little difference between them.

Malcolm wrote:
You are assuming that Longchenpa's views and Mipham's views are monolithic, cut from the same mold. They aren't. You can't just paste them up side by side without taking into account the vast differences in environment that produced them.

Longchenpa is writing in a fairly polemic free environment, a full 100 years before the major controversies raised by Tsongkhapa and his opponents. He was mainly writing in an environment where Nyingma teachings in general were being somewhat neglected and provided a basis in scholarship for many of the teachings of Dzogchen. That being said, Longchenpa's writings also seem to have been neglected for quite a long while, perhaps because during this period Nyingma was institutionally weak.

Mipham is writing at the end of 400 years of trenchant polemics between Gelugpas and everyone else. The vast majority of his critiques in the Original Mind Trilogy are being leveled at Gelugpas who presume to interpret Dzogchen through the lens of their own educational background. For example, the main recipient of criticism of MIpham is a guy named Jawa Dö ngag, who was a student of Zhabkar and Paltrul, who also had a Gelug background.

The whole of the Original Mind series is a recording of Mipham's oral teachings in response to that fellow's interpretation of Dzogchen. Indeed, we can see a great deal of similarity between the ideas about Dzogchen that are being rejected by Mipham and some ideas about Dzogchen advanced today by HH Dalai Lama.

Duckworth then provides lots and lots of Longchenpa to substantiate the claim that in Dzogchen pontentiality manifests Buddha qualities. One of such snippets is as follows:

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, the qualities exist as potentials in the basis,  but not as fully manifest. The manifestation of the potentiality of the qualities of the basis occurs because of realization. We  see Mipham defining the presence of qualities based on a subjective criteria:
While maintaining the position, “This purification of any obscurations is the feature of the time of path. This total purification of obscurations is the feature of the time of the result,” is in accord with the mode of appearance of sentient beings, from the perspective of the mode of existence of dharmatā, it is not possible to move even slightly away from abiding in state of uniformity which lacks any divisions of dualistic phenomena such as division by three times, division into pure and impure, sentient beings and buddhas, and so on. Therefore, the unfixed mode of appearance (of not realizing the basis just as it) is not defined as if the basis was the time of the sentient beings, and the path was the phase of a bodhisattva. The extremely pure result is the dhātu of the basis that has always been free of obscuration in the sight of the Buddha, because that seer who sees the qualities as having always been perfect is the pristine consciousness that sees ultimate reality in which existence and appearance totally correspond. 

From the perspective of seeing that ultimate sight of the ultimate, since this assertion by the treatises of the Great Perfection that all phenomena have always been buddhahood in the essence of the buddhahood of the result is proven with reasoning of ultimate investigation. it cannot be refuted by anyone as not being so. Therefore, since it is similar with the teaching in the Mahāyāna sūtras that the sugatagarbha has always been endowed with the qualities such as the ten powers and so on, it is also definitive in meaning.
He also points out:
Therefore, similarly,  since there is no proliferation of any kind in the dharmatā of the mind, the naturally luminous self-originated pristine consciousness, the conventions of dualistic dharmas such as whether that is newly realized or not do not exist. Realization and nonrealization are dualities in the mind. Therefore, that dharmatā of the mind, the object to be realized with the path, is the suchness that has always been present. The realizer of that is the mind (blo), which is the wisdom of hearing, reflection and meditation. That is the mind (yid) at the occasions of the unceasing concepts of hearing and so on. When that mind (yid) is introduced to that dharmatā, the mind itself is also realized in the state of that dharmatā, and there is no difference between the subject and the object. Therefore, though the convention of realization and nonrealization do not exist in the dharmatā of the basis, this convention of realization and nonrealization is to be understood to be from the perspective of the mind of the sentient being that arises from the state of dharmatā.

The point of view of both Dzogchen and Lamdre is that qualities are present in the basis in the form of a potential, but are not present as fully expressed. The latter is the gzhan stong perspective, which you can read about in Mountain Doctrine and other places.

The difference is pretty well established in this way: in Dzogchen, the qualities are expressed by realizing the nature of the basis. Those qualities do not exist prior to realization.

In gzhan stong, the qualities already exist, and are revealed merely through the removal of afflictions.

In Dzogchen, afflictions become the five wisdoms through the process of realization; in gzhan stong the afflictions are absolutely different than the five wisdoms, the removal of the former reveals the latter.

Moreover, the gzhan stong pas, the basis and result are undifferentiable. Mountain Doctrine, ppg. 89 states, "These say that this which is the body of attributes, matrix-of-one-done-to-bliss, element of attributes, omnipresent in all three states, is the very perfection of wisdom, the undifferentiable entity of the basis and fruit, the buddha lineage, and say that it exists at all times and the basis of all phenomena..."

Now, you may believe that takes three incalculable eons, or you may practice mantra and wisdom.

Either way, the Buddha taught the dharani and mantra gate in sutra, and spoke of its incalculable benefits.

Which do not require empowerment.

The empowerment of the 10th Bhumi Bodhisattva is automatic.

In fact, the Treasure Chest Seal sutra, discussed here recently, speaks of receiving the empowerment of all Buddhas through that very dharani.

You are trying to reduce an incredibly complex sutra to a self-serving point that tries to elude the simple matter discussed here.

Sutra mantras do not require empowerment, and somehow people are making it sound different.

It's not.

Malcolm wrote:
The empowerment of tenth stage bodhisattvas occurs at the end of three incalcuable eons, dhāraṇis and all.

There is no method taught in any sūtra of going from the stage of a beginner to a fully awakened buddha in a single lifetime. That kind of teaching belongs to Vajrayāna alone. In order to practice Vajrayāna, one must receive empowerment. In order to receive empowerment, one must have a guru. There is no other way.

There is nothing at all wrong with reciting dhāraṇis, but reciting them will not lead a beginner to fully awakening in this life.

In Vajrayana, many things require empowerment, and your own little theories on the matter are of little import, you're not in any position to be disputing what some people are taught by their teachers, while of course you're welcome to your own practice.

Some traditions of course have practices that require no empowerment, however, I wonder how many would say "sure just get it off the internet and start with no instruction". I'm sure there are a few (maybe pureland works like that?), but i'd imagine that it'd still be recommended to make some kind of connection, and get a walkthrough.

If Stearns is correct (i.e., if his translations of Dolpopa are accurate), then Dolpopa's version of gzhan-stong is indeed quite incompatible with Dzogchen -- but for entirely different reasons that the supposed inherent existence of intrinsic Buddha qualities:

Stearns' Dolpopa, in Buddha from Dolpo, 103 said:
Buddhahood is stated to be the buddha-body of gnosis, and the incidental impurities are stated to be the groups of consciousness. In that way gnosis and consciousness are stated to be extremely different, like light and dark, or nectar and poison. Nevertheless, the differentiation of those two is very rare. These days the majority maintains that this very mind-as-such is the buddha-body of reality, self-arisen gnosis, and the Great Seal, and many maintain that concepts are the buddha-body of reality, the afflicting emotions are gnosis, samsara and nirvana are indivisible, these appearances and sounds are the three buddha-bodies or the four buddha-bodies, and so forth.

treehuggingoctopus said:
Stearns' commentary is as follows:

Stearns, Buddha from Dolpo, 104 said:
For Dolpopa appearances cannot be the manifestation or self-presencing of gnosis (ye shes rang snang), or the buddha-body of reality, because ordinary appearances are completely fictitious, imaginary (parikalpita) and dependent (paratantra) phenomena, which are both actually nonexistent. The fully established true nature (parinispanna), nondual gnosis, the buddha-body of reality, and so forth, are real and existent.

On the other hand, the gzhan stongpas have a good explanation for how Buddhahood is both uncreated and "positive." If I'm understanding correctly, the gzhan stongpas would say that once the obscurations are removed, then the virtues of Buddhahood naturally manifest. So from that POV, compassion is natural while greed, hatred, and delusion are distortions based on ignorance. Once the distorting influences are removed, then compassion and so forth would come forth naturally and effortlessly.

How is this handled from in Dzogchen?

Malcolm wrote:
gzhan stong pas claim that the qualities of the result are fully manifested in sentient beings, from the beginning.

This is how Mipham characterizes it:
From the perspective of the mode of appearance, the basis itself never ripens as the result, and since that non-ripening is not the actual dharmakāya, since this present basis is not the buddhahood that manifest the ten powers from the mere cause of the dharmakāya, it may be considered that “dharmakāya of the basis” is not "the actual one.” Nevertheless, from the perspective of the just the time of the original basis, since the conventions of liberation and nornliberation do not exist, while there are no sentient beings, there are also no buddhas because liberation and delusion are totally impossible [in the basis]. 

When the appearance of the basis arises from that, there are two paths, liberation and delusion, that are produced from this appearance of the basis. Liberation arises from realizing the basis just as it is. Delusion arises from not realizing the basis. When the appearance of the basis arise, when one arrives at the liberation of the initial state of original purity, since realization is manifest buddhahood, the ten powers are actualized. Therefore, though the qualities of nirvana such as the ten powers and so on that do not exist in the basis exist as a primordial endowment, other than those who have reached the ultimate realization, buddhas, when even the bodhisattvas of the tenth bhumi cannot see the manifestation of all qualities, what need is there to mention ordinary sentient beings [being able to see them]? That being so, the difference between all the qualities of the basis being manifestly apparent or nonapparent is not from perspective of just the basis. [4/a] It is necessary to make a distinction in dependence on the appearances of a buddha, one who realizes the basis just as it is, and a sentient being, the one who does not realize that.
Hence we can see there is truly a great chasm between the view of gzhan stong and the view of Dzogchen.

Yes, the basis, path and result are not simultaneous for Dzogchen. If they were, there would be no need for a path. Dzogchen is not gradual in the sense that it is a path where one gathers the two accumulations.




smcj said:

Exactly. But regardless of non-realization we are discussing things from the realized perspective (the "one yana perspective").

An enlightened being sees things the way things actually are as well as understanding how their appearances are mistaken by the unaware. That same level of enlightenment that teaches Dzogchen and Mahamudra also teaches all the yanas. There is no difference from the enlightened being's perspective, except for the degree of unawareness of the sentient being(s) in question.

Yes, that is what yāna means, conveyance, etc. Thus, when we say there is one vehicle, it means that regardless of whatever path we choose to follow, rapid or slow, the overall goal is the same.

Malcolm wrote:

There cannot be something free from extremes.

Dolbupa's great middle way avoids extremes precisely in reverse of the way Tsongkhapa has it. For him freedom from extremes is arrived at in the following way. He tries to avoid eternalism by asserting that relative phenomena are never held to exist more than conventionally, being intrinsically empty; and he tries to avoid nihilism by asserting that ultimate phenomena are held to have always existed, being extrinsically empty.

Here, what Longchenpa is referring to is the standard four fold negation of the extremes found every in sūtra on up to to the Dzogchen tantras, like the Realms and Dimensions of Sound Tantra [ sgra thal 'gyur ]:

The amazing, miraculous pristine consciousness
did not exist before, does not exist later, has not existed from the start;
is at present beyond all conceptual objects, 
having the nature of the emptiness that is free from extremes.

Maybe it's quotes like this:
Dzogpa Chenpo's view is freedom from extremes is similar to Prasangika-Madhyamka's for the most part. [The main difference] is that the important basic view of Madhyamaka is of a spacelike empty aspect, while the principal basic view of [Dzogpa Chenpo] is of primordially pure and naked intrinsic awareness [ rig pa ] which is ineffable and unceasing. According to Dzogpa Chenpo, intrinsic awareness and everything that arises within it are free from all extremes, like the [nonexistence] of the limits to space.
Ch'os dbyings mdzod kyi 'grel ha Lung gi gter mdzod, by Longchen Rabjam, translated by Richard Barron in A Treasure Trove of Scriptural Transmission, page x.

So if I were more Gelug minded (which I'm not), I might say this goes beyond the non-affirming negation of emptiness by positing something, namely rig pa which has the nature of clarity.

No, it is not an affirming negation, since Longchenpa states:

Malcolm wrote:
Damn autocorrect....


All Mipham is saying is that there are two perspectives, how things are and how things appear. From the perspective of how things are, "it is necessary to propose that the universe and beings are primordial buddhahood and meditate in that way."

From the point of view of how things appear, the basis, path and result are divvied up by wisdom according their features: the basis concerns proving the validity of buddhahood. This is why, for example, we have the account of Samantabhadra's buddhahood and the account of the delusion of sentient beings. There is also a practice, and also the culmination of the purification of the delusion which gave rise to sentient beings in the first place. Since only deluded people are concerned with liberation, the path of Dzogchen is very much concerned with correcting the delusion that arises from ignorance [ ma rig pa ] by remaining in the knowledge [ rig pa ] of how things actually are, i.e. that the universe and beings are primordial buddhahood.

We are not approaching practice from the point of view of accepting something that is not true, i.e., that the universe and beings are impure, etc. But we must acquiesce that this is indeed how things appear to us, and that as long as things appear in this way to us, we are under the influence of the two obscurations, which while temporary and not innate, conceal from us our actual state.

The whole gzhan stong project, beginning with Tshan Khawoche, was to reconcile the teachings of the three own natures with the the two truths of Madhyamaka, with a view towards proving that the former illuminated the latter with respect to the notion that buddha qualities are inherent and not newly developed on the path.

Malcolm wrote:
The so called "primordial state" aka the original basis is called "the basis" because it has not been realized. When that is realized, it is given the name, "the result." "The path" is just the method of realizing that, which in the case of the Great Perfection, is the intimate instructions of the direct introduction and their application.

Florin's point of view is influenced very much by "sems sde", which is primarily about the basis. Your point of view is more influenced by man ngag sde, which is more concerned with the methods of realizing that basis.

Another useful snippet from Mipham:
According to that principle, though from the perspective of ultimate reality it is necessary to propose that the universe and beings are primordial buddhahood and meditate in that way, from the perspective of the conventions of the mode of appearances, the differentiation by wisdom into three — the basis, the reasoning that buddhahood is valid; the path, the time of practice; and the result, the culmination of purification — are asserted up to the Great Perfection. Also the treatises of the Great Perfection purpose buddhahood once the fives paths of trekchö and the four visions of thögal are finished, but in terms of the mode of appearances, they never assert the accomplishment of buddhahood without finishing the path. When these two are differentiated, after the darkness of doubt about the topics that any of the vehicles of the cause and result have difficulty realizing, since there arises the appearance of confidence knowledge that cannot be diverted, this differentiation is very important.

In the realization of the Great Perfection that the three times are not time, there are no phenomena of the ten directions and three times that are not perfect.

While maintaining the position, “This purification of any obscurations is the feature of the time of path. This total purification of obscurations is the feature of the time of the result,” is in accord with the mode of appearance of sentient beings, from the perspective of the mode of existence of dharmatā, it is not possible to move even slightly away from abiding in state of uniformity which lacks any divisions of dualistic phenomena such as division by three times, division into pure and impure, sentient beings and buddhas, and so on.

When this is noticed, you cannot fault the person who is noticing this. That would be similar to blaming a reader for a spelling error in your own composition merely because he or she noticed you made a mistake.

Yes, his translation is certainly challenging.

I hope at some point to bring out a new translation of this this text, as well as the second of the trilogy, An Investigation into the Meaning of the Luminous Original Mind, the Differentiation of the Basis, Path and Result of the Great Perfection entitled Illuminating Wisdom.

The first text, which Hopkins translated, is very citation heavy; this text is very argument heavy, with not so many citations. The third text is a dated collection of various comments made over the years by Mipham on the subject, gathered into a single text. It is my hope to comb through that third text and present illuminating passages, perhaps as footnotes, which expand the topics in the first two texts. This is my present side project. I think that the gnyug sems skor gsum, aka the Trilogy on Original Mind, is a very important series of texts. In it, Mipham corrects many misconceptions about Dzogchen. One thing he especially attacks at length is the idea that the so-called "original mind" is a subtle mind, rather than what it actually is, the nature of the mind, whether that mind is subtle or coarse.

BTW, however challenging Hopkin's translations may be, he is to be highly commended for being the first to bring this into English, as well as Mountain Dharma by Dolbupa.

Thus, in the Highest Yoga Tantra system of the New Translation Schools, the fundamental mind which serves as the basis of all the phenomena of cyclic existence and nirvana is posited as the ultimate truth or nature of phenomena (dharmata, chos nyid); it is also sometimes called the “clear light” (abhasvara, ’od gsal) and “uncompounded” (asamskrta, ’dus ma byas). In Nyingma it is called the “mind-vajra”... This is the final root of all minds, forever indestructible, immutable, and of unbreakable continuum like a vajra [or diamond]. Just as the New Translation Schools posit a beginningless and endless fundamental mind, so Nyingma posits a mind-vajra which has no beginning or end and proceeds without interruption through the effect stage of Buddhahood. It is considered “permanent” in the sense of abiding forever and thus is presented as a permanent mind. It is permanent not in the sense of not disintegrating moment by moment but in the sense that its continuum is not interrupted—this being analogous to the statement in Maitreya’s Ornament for Clear Realization that a Buddha’s exalted activities are considered permanent in that they are inexhaustible. It is also non-produced in the sense that it is not adventitiously and newly produced by causes and conditions [since its continuum has always existed].

My point exactly. To me there is no difference between my grandmother killing a chicken for her Sunday family gathering and the butcher.

Even though the butcher doesn't kill all the animals having specific clients in mind, when one is buying meat it is like taking meat expressly killed for this person. Why so?
Because if the butcher doesn't have the specific piece of meat the client is looking for, the client will ask for it, complain about the absence of meat. Therefore, in the very act of buying meat-even already prepared, there is the actualization of an order placed implicitely and that reveals itself in plain words when the clients complains in case his favourite piece of meat is lacking in the store. In the economic field,  it is duly called 'demand', and there is a reason for that it seems to me.

That is definitely what Malcolm is saying.  He notes a number of zhentong texts, including Kongtrul's Treasury of Knowledge, which delineate the three natures as a part of zhentong.  It is interesting to note these chittamatra doctrines which Kongtrul says are free of the errors of chittamatra.

Malcolm wrote:
The point is that the way the gzhan stong pas use the three nature theory is not at all consistent with the way they are used by Maitreyanatha, Asanga, and Vasubandhu, etc. Not only does Tsongkhapa, Gorampa, Rongton and many others note this polemically, but even Khenpo Karl notes:
Though most followers of gzhan stong accept Vasubandhu’s Yogācāra texts in general as belonging to the gzhan stong view, in light of his always using model (1), the frequent explanation in gzhan stong texts that model (1) is characteristic for sems tsam, while model (2) represents one of the most crucial features that distinguishes gzhan stong from sems tsam, then appears to be problematic not only with regard to Vasubandhu’s works. This equally applies to the texts of Maitreya and Asaṅga (held to be the principal forefathers of gzhan stong) and all other Indian Yogācāras, since they all use model (1). In addition, Tibetan gzhan stong pas differ as to which ones among those Yogācāras they consider to be proponents of gzhan stong and which ones they merely regard as sems tsam pas.
http://wordpress.tsadra.org/?p=1215

Kongtrul falls into the same trap as all the other gzhan stong pas who preceded him when he tries to differentiate sems tsam and gzhan stong through the difference in the way they use the three natures.

You are demonstrably wrong about Kongtrul's treatment of the Uttaratantrashastra not being zhentong.  For example, in his text 'The rays of the vajra moon, a guide to the zhentong madhyamaka view', he says:
....
He refers again and again to the Uttaratantra in this text and does not mention the three natures.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, while it is true in this text of instructions on how to meditate gzhan stong view that he takes his primary scheme as the impure, partially pure and impure and the pure, derived from Uttaratantra, it is completely disingenuous for you to claim that his presentation of gzhan stong excludes mention of the three natures. For example, even in this text, he resorts to the use of the term parikalpita, kun btags, on page 599, vol 8 of the Palpung blockprint of the text in question.

More to the point, in his formal presentation of the gzhan stong view in the Treasury of Knowledge, Frameworks of Buddhist Philosophy, ppg. 249-269, he devotes a good two pages to outlining the three natures as a key doctrine in this system, but in fact, the use of the three natures pervades his explanation of the system in the twenty or so pages he devotes to it.

So while it may be the case that in this meditation manual you bring up there is no full explication of the three natures, in fact the three natures are vital feature of gzhan stong theory that cannot be ignored. As I pointed out, this one difference between Longchenpa, who, while a huge fan of the Uttaratantra, happily consigns the three yogacara treatises of Maitreya to Yogacara-cittamatra; and Dolbupa, who believes that all five treatises of Maitreya have the same intention and that they cannot be placed on a scale.

Indeed, this is a key ingredient to understanding gzhan stong thought, for not only are its exponenents willing to try and understand all the treatises of Maitreya as definitive in meaning, not only do they interpret the three natures in a way substantially different than Maitreyanatha, Asanga and Vasubandhu, but they also, unfortunately, adhere to a historical interpretation of the three turnings of the wheel that does not even come from India, but rather, Korea [i.e. Won'chuk's Three Volume Commentary on the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra], widely popularized by Buton in his history of Dharma.

sherabpa said:
So you should not keep telling yourself and everyone else that zhentong is essentially or primarily about the three natures, notwithstanding a few apposite comments by Rangjung Dorje.

Malcolm wrote:
I think I shall, since it is demonstrable.

sherabpa said:
Essentially your 'zhentong' is a straw man.  It was no more refuted by Nagarjuna than the Uttaratantrashastra was refuted by Nagarjuna, since it does not go beyond what was taught by Maitreya.

Malcolm wrote:
I don't have a problem with the Uttaratantra. I accept it as a definitive summary of the Buddha's teaching in sūtra, just as I accept Nāgārjuna's Madhyamaka as the definitive statement of Sūtra Mahāyāna Buddhist view. There is no contradiction between them.

What I can't accept is 1) any hermeneutic based upon the so called three turnings of the wheel interpreted as historical epochs in the life of the Buddha, since this hermeneutic is directly contradicted by Maitryeanatha in the Sutralaṃkara 2.1, and thus is a still born hermeneutic; 2) I cannot accept the gzhan stong presentation of the three natures which is demonstrably distorted and incorrect. In other words, I do not accept the basic groundwork upon which the gzhan stong view is erected.

To enlarge on the first point, there is no Indian source, none at all, for any of the various schemes to bracket this or that Mahāyāna sūtra into the second two turnings mentioned in the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra. Therefore, to say that the "Yogacara" sūtras belong the third turning, or the "Prajñāpāramita" Sūtras belong to the second, or the "Tathagātagarbha" Sūtras to the third etc., is entirely speculative. All we can say is that the Agamas belong to the first, and Mahāyāna sūtras belong to the second and third; but of the latter, we have no inkling of what sūtras are to be included in the second and third turnings, since as Maitreyanatha points out in the Sutrālaṃkara 2.1.a:
Not previously predicted, arising simultaneously...
And that is where we stand.

Luminosity is not equivalent to mere clarity. Luminosity is the ultimate nature of the mind, according to the Perfection of Wisdom tradition, which you accept as definitive.

Tsongkhapafan said:
The Perfection of Wisdom Sutra does not say that luminosity is the ultimate nature of mind. The mind being clear light is not dealt with in Buddha's Sutra teachings.

Malcolm wrote:
You are quite wrong. According the Perfection of Wisdom Sūtra in 8,000, not only is the nature of the mind luminous [clear light, 'od gsal ba ], everything is luminous, from the material aggregate all the way on up to omniscience. Luminosity pervades everything, but the clarity [ gsal ba ] of the mind does not.

For example, the Play of Noble Mañjūśrī Sūtra states:
Afflictions are temporary, they cannot simultaneous with the realization of emptiness; they cannot simultaneous with the knowledge of the absence of characteristics and the absence of aspiration; they cannot simultaneous with natural luminosity.
Or for example, the Ornamental Illumination of Pristine Consciousness that Enters the Domain of the Noble Buddhas Sūtra states:
Awakening [bodhi] is the natural luminosity of the natural luminosity of the mind. If it is asked why [bodhi] called luminosity, whatever is natural, that is without affliction, equal with space, possessing the nature of space, properly included within space and like space, because it is very luminous by nature.
Here we have a very clear equivalence: bodhi = clear light/luminosity.

Further, the Śūraṃgamasamādhi Sūtra states:
All phenomena nonabiding, because they are naturally isolated. Because they are nonabiding, they are called nonabiding; since all phenomena are naturally luminous, they are not entities.
The Pratyutpanna Sūtra states:
Because all these phenomena are naturally luminous, they are equivalent with nirvana.
The Vajra Essence Dhārani Sūtra states:
Mañjuśrī, the absence of afflction is awakening, natural luminosity is always nonarising.
The Sūtra that Explains The Manifestation Into the Domain the Method of Of the Sphere of Bodhisattvas states
The mind for unsurpassed true perfect awakening is the mind without afflictions because the turmoil of afflictions has been removed; is the mind of luminosity because it is luminous by nature...
The Sūtra of The Definitive Explanation of the Compassion of the Tathāgata states:
Because the mind is naturally luminous, awakening is naturally luminous. If it is asked for what reason it is naturally luminous, what is natural, that without afflictions, equivalent with space, the nature of space, remains equal with space, is even because it is even with space. That nature is very luminous. Since childish ordinary people do not comprehend natural luminosity, they are afflicted by temporary afflictions. The tathāgatas engage sentient beings with compassion, thinking, "They should comprehend natural luminosity."
The Sūtra of the Intimate Instructions of Mahāyana state:
Due to all sentient beings being like illusions and all sentient beings being naturally luminous, because one's mind is the same, comprehend that the minds of all sentient beings are the same.
In fact the tantras use the same terminology as the above to describe natural luminosity.

Tsongkhapafan said:
Even in the Tantras where the ultimate nature of phenomena is asserted as the union of bliss and emptiness a distinction is made between mind and its emptiness - they are not one and the same.

U huh, so for you, the nature of one thing is inserted into another thing. Like stuffing an olive with pimento. For you, things are not empty, they just have to have emptiness inserted into them.

Malcolm wrote:
If mind is not emptiness, there is no union of the two truths.

Yes, actually it does, just as wetness and water are the same thing, heat and fire are the same thing.

Moreover, the default attitude towards men in the justice system is based on the high incidence of men in the legal system being there because assault and rape are perpetrated by men on women. That being said, according to the Bureau of Justice itself, between 2006 and 2010 65 percent of all rapes and sexual assaults go unreported.

10. Female privilege is being able to divorce your spouse when your marriage is no longer working because you know you will most likely be granted custody of your children.

Malcolm wrote:
You do understand that when men and women divorce, it used to be the case that the standard of living for divorced women with children declines 37% while a man's improved. This has changed in the last decade or so because of improvements in pay equity. These days both men and women can expect a decrease of about 25% in standard of living following a divorce. Some privilege.

Jesse said:
11. Female privilege is being able to call the police in a domestic dispute knowing they will take your side. Female privilege is not having your gender work against where police are involved.

Malcolm wrote:
This is not a privilege, this based on the fact that men beat women and children. It is a preventative measure which prevents a great number of assaults and murders. So, not a privilege.

Jesse said:
12. Female privilege is being able to be caring or empathetic without people being surprised.

Malcolm wrote:
Dude, you are really reaching on this one.

Jesse said:
13. Female privilege is not having to take your career seriously because you can depend on marrying someone who makes more money than you do. Female privilege is being able to be a “stay at home mom” and not seem like a loser.

Malcolm wrote:
This is so wrong on so many levels. This is not reflected in today's economy on any level.

Jesse said:
14. Female privilege is being able to cry your way out of a speeding ticket.

Malcolm wrote:
Ummm, no, this is a result of male sexism.

Jesse said:
15. Female privilege is being favored by teachers in elementary, middle and high school. Female privilege is graduating high school more often, being accepted to more colleges, and generally being encouraged and supported along the way.

Malcolm wrote:
No, this is really nonsense.

Jesse said:
16. Female privilege being able to have an opinion without someone tell you you’re just Misogynist .”

Malcolm wrote:
No, they just get, "Why are you being such a bitch?"

Jesse said:
17. Female privilege is being able to talk about sexism without appearing self-serving.

Malcolm wrote:
No, this is a result of the fact that there is sexism against women, it is pervasive, and it is damaging to the people who experience it and perpetrate it, both.

Jesse said:
18. Female privilege is arrogantly believing that sexism only applies to women.

Malcolm wrote:
You have yet to demonstrate any so called female privilege at all.  A women's right to her own body is a right, not a privilege. Since the legal definition of life begins in the second trimester, in this country women have the right to choose. I support the right to choose, but not abortion itself.

Title: Re: What is wrong with feminists these days?

I don't know any feminists. The only experience I have with them is online. Like I said if there are more moderate feminists, I have never heard from them. I thought feminism was a good idea until I started reading articles written by them, because they do indeed reek of an anti-men sentiment, entitlement, and pure generalized judging of all 'white men'. Which I find it incredibly stupid.

There was an article not too long ago where a group of feminists wanted their school principle to be fired unless he made a public announcement at his school acknowledging and apologizing for his 'white male privilege', etc.

Malcolm wrote:
But there is such a thing as white male privilege.

Jesse said:
There forums are filled with questions on how to 'educate' men in their lives of how privileged they are etc. If you go and point out the ways in which women are privileged, you'll instantly be cast a misogynist, verbally attacked and usually quickly banned.

Malcolm wrote:
White women are privileged with respect to their race, but not their gender.

Jesse said:
Women also have privileges in society which men do not. I'm sure everyone can think of at least a few.

Malcolm wrote:
For example?
