Yes, someone objects and says Madhyamaka are basically nastikas for claiming that there is no good or bad actions, no agent, and no result because there is no inherent existence,  they are like nihilists.

Candra agrees that both nihilists and Mādhyamikas are alike in rejecting inherent existence, but they differ in that Mādhyamikas advocate dependent origination, and claim that this life and the next lack inherent existence. The second thing is that nihilists reject what they cannot see, whereas the Mādhyamika willing infers from dependent origination that there is another world after death in this one and so on.

Nāgārjuna's arguments were with opponents that what we would call philosophers. But they weren't concerned with scientific or theoretical questions about 'how the world works' or what are the principles behind why objects fall or what radiation is. They were concerned with the question of ultimate truth. They had various doctrinal formulae about the ultimate nature of things, all of which were shown by Nāgārjuna to be self-contradictory.  When it is said that 'something cannot be established' or has no 'sva-bhava', it is in the context of a discussion about ultimates.

There is a sense in which the 'common people' are deluded (speaking as one of them) - but the way 'common people speak' is perfectly adequate in respect of matters of mundane fact. If you were ill, you would go a common person designated and trained as a doctor for treatment, and hopefully he would diagnose the cause of the malady and proscribe the appropriate treatment. It would do you no good to have him say 'well according to Nāgārjuna neither your illness or yourself have any basis in reality'. That might be true in an ultimate, philosophical sense, but it is very much a matter of context, and in the context, appealing to Nāgārjuna would not be germane.

Malcolm wrote:
Nāgārjuna strictly defines his notions of existence and nonexistence to what common people consider existence and nonexistence. This is evident from reading chapter 15 of the MMK and a number of other sections.

Where we disagree, is over whether or not relative truth is to be left alone. It is not. It is by analyzing the things of relative truth that we arrive at the ultimate. In other words, we analyze our mistaken perceptions in hopes of coming to a veridical one.

But in the end we have to accept that neither the relative or ultimate are established as real in anyway.

But, Malcolm, isn't it true that Tsongkhapa's graduated system is intended to guide one through method and wisdom into union? He makes it clear that once a practitioner has achieved a certain level, the lam rim isn't enough and it is necessary to invoke vajrayana.

Malcolm wrote:
The Gelugpa point of view, along the later Sakya POV, is that view of reality in sūtra and tantra is the same. The Gelugpas further insist that even if you are meditating Vajrayāna, your view must be strictly in accord with their understanding of Prasangika.

Jeff H said:
In the meantime, the examination of mere existence is about discerning which appearances function and how to choose between that which is helpful and that which is harmful.

Malcolm wrote:
Ascertaining that which is a wrong path and that which is a right path is not really the specific domain of Madhyamaka critique, though indeed Aryadeva does spend four of his eight chapters in clarifying correct relative truth.

Jeff H said:
Madhyamaka may indeed be as limited as you say. But I don't think it can be argued that Tsongkhapa is focusing on the point where convention means the ultimate.

Malcolm wrote:
No one made this assertion. The assertion being made is that by asserting that the ultimate is only the absence of inherent existence, the consequence of this is that the ultimate is a mere nonexistence.

Jeff H said:
He is trying to make it clear that the conventional is not about what's "real", and to begin cultivating a mere concept of emptiness to be further realized when bodhicitta has been more fully developed.

Malcolm wrote:
Nevertheless, in discussions about Madhyamaka with Gelugpas in general, one finds oneself discussing the how to make a conventional truth that won't upset the neighbors. So endless verbiage is spent trying to perfect something which is not essential and has no essence in the least.


Jeff H said:
In the conventional world suffering is real enough that it needs our attention. Tsongkhapa addresses that while telling us let go of the appearances.

Malcolm wrote:
The suffering of suffering seems real enough for those to whom it appears. For example, when I have a kidney stone, it seems pretty real in that moment, since I am just an ordinary guy. But I also have training and so I also know it is not real, it is not essential, and is principally a function of delusion and karma by which this false appearance is maintained. I also know that delusion is not solid or real, and that any tendency to give into feelings of solidity or realness reinforces that mistaken perception. So while I am writhing in agony I am also acutely aware of the fact apart from pain that has been experienced and has not been experienced, at present there is no pain — at least in my better moments.

Where does your definition of nihilism come from?

Wayfarer said:
The dictionary. But, accusations of nihilism were often made about Buddhism, generally, and Nāgārjuna, in particular, from time immemorial. Nāgārjuna goes to lengths to rebut those accusations, but I don't often see much mention of those rebuttals. Nihilism - the idea that nothing is real - is a very pervasive attitude in today's world - just a Nietszche predicted it would be. It is insidious and often hard to notice - it might be as simple as a shrug and a 'whatever'.

Malcolm wrote:
Ucchedavāda, very often mistranslated as nihilism, was originally the assertion that a self which exists now perishes at death.

It was later applied to the general idea of asserting that a thing which exists now perishes and becomes nonexistent.

In common perception, if something exists, it can be destroyed. For example, a pot or a tree. When we cut down a tree, we commonly say, "There used to be a tree there, now it no longer exists."

"There used to be a coral reef there, now it no longer exists."

This is the way common people speak, and it is not accurate.

When read carefully, one comes to understand that Nāgārjuna shows that nothing in conventional truth, that which is perceived by common people, has any basis in reality whatsoever.

Things are false entities we abstract from appearances. When examining these things we find that they do not exist apart from our definition of them. Their boundaries are arbitrarily drawn and defined.

The point of Madhyamaka is not to claim there are no appearances. The point of Madhyamaka is to understand these appearances are not real. For example, a liquid entity appears in six different ways to the beings of the six different realms, an appearance conventionally valid for one is invalid for the rest. Water is real for a human but not a hell being. We cannot therefor say that appearances are real.

What cloudburst means when he says things "merely exist" is that these appearances function within our scope of perception.

But the point of Madhyamaka is to find the real nature of these appearances, whatever it is, because these appearances are not real entities.  The point is Madhyamaka is not make a perfect relative truth for human beings, because no relative truth is perfect. They are all flawed perceptions. The objects of flawed perceptions are deceptive. The way they appear and the way they exist are not integrated. For a Buddha, the way things exist and the way things appear are integrated. Madhyamaka is trying to uncover the meeting point between the way things exist and the way things appear. Since conventional truth is not the way things exist but merely the way things appear to ordinary people, we say that conventional truth is unreal since it does not conform with how things exist. The Gelugpas would have one believe that merely by understand that the things that appear are devoid of inherent existence is itself the reconciliation point between the way things exist and the way the appear. They assert that the way things exist is free of inherent existence, and that solely by negating inherent existence one comes to harmony between the way things exist and the way they appear.

I personally have found yet no convincing argument that the negation of inherent existence is all there is to Mahāyāna emptiness. In this I follow a 600 year old tradition of objection to the Gelugpa point of view.

I also think Madhyamaka is a very limited tool.

That's not the consequence at all. There are a couple of instances where one would still have the seeds of delusion but not be in samsara.

The first example is Hinayana Foe Destroyers as I have said. These Superiors take rebirth in the fourth form realm which has eight levels. The last five are Hinayana Pure Lands called Not Great, Without Pain, Excellent Appearance, Great Seeing, and None Higher. When Hinayana Foe Destroyers die they often choose to be born in one of these Lands, where they can remain at peace for as long as they wish. These Pure Lands are beyond samsara, but they are not Buddha Lands, but even though practically they are beyond samsara they would still have self-grasping at subtle and very subtle levels of mind.

Another example would be where someone takes rebirth in a Buddha's Pure Land either through their own power or through the powa prayers done by others. They would have the seeds of delusion in their minds so they would not have attained liberation strictly speaking, but they would be liberated from a practical point of view because they would be in a world where there are no true sufferings and no possibility of falling into samsara again.

In both of these cases, the beings still have work to do to attain actual liberation, and of course Buddhahood.

Sorry, fellas, no satisfactory answers so far.

Its vague, but this seems to be an account the Buddha gave of his enlightenment.

As Malcolm suggests, this does seem to be limited to an analysis of this life. But I've never understood why there are these two versions of the arising of the mass of suffering. At what point did the Buddha realize this 10 linked chain, and at what point did he realize the 12 linked chain? Or maybe the correct question is, when did he decide to to teach the 12 links, tracing suffering to ignorance?

The implications of this 10 link teaching is very different than the 12 linked chain. This suggests that consciousness and name and form are a twofold basis from which suffering arises. This seems to teach the cure to suffering is annihilation of the the conciousness/name and form complex.

I wonder if this difference is the basis on which Mahayana divides the Hinayana into the Sravakayana and Pratyekabuddhayana? In Mahayana, they say the Sravaka seeks annihilation, while the pratyekabuddha's awakening is based on the 12 linked chain.

Notwithstanding, I would like to understand why the Buddha taught this 10 linked chain.

Here we can see you trying to say that it is not correct to say that dependent phenomena exist inherently or by way of a nature or essence, and your reason is that they have never arisen, but we can see that you means things are not produced, or arisen, ultimately.

Malcolm wrote:
Things do not arise. Why? Because their causes and conditions cannot be established when investigated. This is why Buddhapalita states:
Here, with respect to your claim for an ascertained cause for the production of a result, wheat, etc., and a non-productive condition and non-condition, ‘the arising of a result is not accepted’ was previously explained. 

If that result does not exist, where will ‘these are not conditions, these are conditions’ be accepted? If both of those come to be from depending on a result, also that result is does not exist. Because the result does not exist, where will there be a non-condition or a condition? If that is so, still results are not accepted, and even conditions and a non-conditions are non-existent. Because results, conditions, and non-conditions do not exist, descriptions for arising are merely conventional.

Dependently-originated food does not sustain us. Our addiction to things, however, does.

If you say yes, it is clear you are simply trying to avoid admitting fault, if no, then perhaps you can give a coherent account as to why the illusion simile should be separated out from the rest for special (unindicated) meaning?


Malcolm wrote:
Your car is an echo, your wife is a city of ghandarvas. How so? When you analyze your car, it cannot be found, just as when one searches for the source of an echo heard in a valley it cannot be found. Your wife is a city of ghandaravas whose evanescent appearance vanishes just out of reach when sought. Illusions, echos, and cities of gandharvas refer to phenomena that clearly appear but when examined are not found to exist. All dependently originated phenomena are just like that— clearly apparent yet nonexistent. It is not necessary to add the qualifier "inherently" or "ultimately." Why?

As Śantideva says, when neither an entity or nonentity remain before the mind, the mind is pacified. Clearly apparent nonexistents are neither entities nor nonentities.

Therefore, since in this Madhyamaka system to be a dependent arising is to lack autonomy, lacking autonomy is what emptiness means; emptiness does not mean that nothing exists.

Malcolm wrote:
And since nothing can be be found which can act as a cause or a condition for any other thing, nothing ever arose; and so to say of the nonarising that it does not exist is incorrect since there is no existence by which its nonexistence could be known.

I'm not talking about the obstructions to omniscience - according to Tantra, a direct realisation of emptiness with a gross mind is not an actual direct realisation and so these Hearers and Solitary Realizers are not actual Superior beings and they still have delusions at subtle and very subtle levels of mind and thus, strictly speaking, they are not liberated. Practically speaking though they have reduced their ignorance to the extent that it can never ripen throwing karma - thus they are not reborn in samsara.

The second mode of being and non-being is seen in the ‘orders and differences of created natures’ (I.444a), whereby, if one level of nature is said to exist, those orders above or below it are said not to exist:
For an affirmation concerning the lower (order) is a negation concerning the higher, and so too a negation concerning the lower (order) is an affirmation concerning the higher.

According to this mode, the affirmation of man is the negation of angel [or 'higher being'] and vice versa.
This mode illustrates Eriugena's original way of dissolving the traditional Neoplatonic hierarchy of being into a dialectic of affirmation and negation: to assert one level is to deny the others. In other words, a particular level may be affirmed to be real by those on a lower or on the same level, but the one above it is thought not to be real in the same way. If humans are thought to exist in a certain way, then angels do not exist in that way.

Malcolm wrote:
Clearly, that is not a Buddhist account, and I'm not presenting it as such. But it is much closer to the style of Buddhist arguments, than anything from modern analytical or empirical philosophy. It's also interesting because of the dialectical nature of the analysis, i.e. things that are real on one level, are unreal on another. I think that aspect is quite close in meaning to the original import of the two truths teaching.[/quote]

It is a little different. As Śantideva points out, the ultimate of the lower is the relative of the higher. When we come to Madhyāmika, the negation of the lower is not an affirmation of its own tenets because Madhyamaka has no tenets to proclaim.

Thanks for those explanations.

I think in Buddhism (as in other wisdom traditions) there is an understanding of the hierarchy of being, with the Buddha signifying the utmost or highest reality, and beings in lower realms being subject to delusion. That is why the same thing can appear differently to different levels of beings, such as is often discussed in relation to the hypothetical glass of water. That is also signified in symbolic form by the Bhavachakra, with the Buddha appearing outside the Wheel.

Malcolm wrote:
No. The Buddha has the same state as us. The only difference is whether we recognize that or not. As Nāgārjuna states in the MMK:

Tsongkhapafan said:
The first example is Hinayana Foe Destroyers as I have said. These Superiors take rebirth in the fourth form realm which has eight levels. The last five are Hinayana Pure Lands called Not Great, Without Pain, Excellent Appearance, Great Seeing, and None Higher. When Hinayana Foe Destroyers die they often choose to be born in one of these Lands, where they can remain at peace for as long as they wish. These Pure Lands are beyond samsara, but they are not Buddha Lands, but even though practically they are beyond samsara they would still have self-grasping at subtle and very subtle levels of mind.

Malcolm wrote:
You are conflating the afflictive obscuration (kleśa -avarana) with the knowledge obscuration (jñeya-avarana). The five pure abodes are where a certain kind of never returner takes rebirth. But once they attain arhatship there, they cease taking rebirth in any of the three realms, including the five pure abodes.

Tsongkhapafan said:
Another example would be where someone takes rebirth in a Buddha's Pure Land either through their own power or through the powa prayers done by others. They would have the seeds of delusion in their minds so they would not have attained liberation strictly speaking, but they would be liberated from a practical point of view because they would be in a world where there are no true sufferings and no possibility of falling into samsara again.

In both of these cases, the beings still have work to do to attain actual liberation, and of course Buddhahood.

They are not nonexistents from the point of ordinary people. From the point of view of ordinary people, things which arise in dependence exist. When one discusses with ordinary people how things are, the only acceptable way to talk about the things which they believe to exist is from the point of view of dependent origination, where this exists that exists, and so on. But this manner of speaking about phenomena is not definitive nor is it final. But if you prefer that I treat you as an ordinary person who has no training in tenets systems, etc., then for you I will say that this and that exists.

From the point of view of some like ourselves who have examined phenomena, it is not correct to state that dependent phenomena exist since they have never arisen, just as illusory elephants and so on have never arisen and yet appear. It is also not correct to state they do not exist since it is improper to say of something which has never arisen that it does not exist.

So we craft this term, "clearly apparent nonexistent." It is a standard term in Sakya and Nyingma Madhyamaka. You may not like it but we don't care.

Your proplem, identified by Rongzom centuries before Tsongkhapa lived, is that Mādhyamikas in his day were excessively attached to relative truth and did not comprehend fully the meaning of illusion. While the introduction of Candrakīrti abolished this problem for a time, it was reintroduced with Tsongkhapa.

This is the reason why Gelugpas have a more difficult time understanding Dzogchen, than say Kagyus or Nyingmas. Sakyas also have their own hangups with respect to attachment to the two stags that get in their way as well. If there is an obstacle for Kagyus with respect to this, it is that they are too attached to meditating. And of course, Nyingmas are too attached to sex and drinking.

It presents as more of a diffuse feeling -- an inkling -- than a thought, but when I examine it, it reveals itself to "contain" a coherent thought.

From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment: 'Name-&-form exists when consciousness exists. From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&-form.' Then the thought occurred to me, 'Consciousness exists when what exists? From what as a requisite condition comes consciousness?' From my appropriate attention there came the breakthrough of discernment: 'Consciousness exists when name-&-form exists. From name-&-form as a requisite condition comes consciousness.'

"Then the thought occurred to me, 'This consciousness turns back at name-&-form, and goes no farther. It is to this extent that there is birth, aging, death, falling away, & re-arising, i.e., from name-&-form as a requisite condition comes consciousness, from consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&-form. From name-&-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media... Thus is the origination of this entire mass of stress. Origination, origination.' Vision arose, clear knowing arose, discernment arose, knowledge arose, illumination arose within me with regard to things never heard before.
This formulation of the arising of suffering has puzzled me for a long time. It differs from the more common teaching on the 12 Linked Chain in that consciousness does not have its base in "constructing activities" which in turn has its base in ignorance. Rather, consciousness and name-and-form are proposed as mutually dependent and arising. Name-and-form is a function of consciousness and consciousness is a function of name-and-form. This is not quite a materialist view, but seems closer to it than the picture given by the 12 Linked Chain.

Can someone please explain what is going on here?

Content:
Panaesthesia said:
“The stages of training with the three kāyas emphasize the qualities of the elements. By training with the sound of the supreme aspect of earth, fire, water, and wind, supreme attainment will be certain. The sound of water is roaring and carries the melodious sound of the ḍākinīs. To always engage and become familiar with this, it is certain that the nirmāṇakāya will be attained. The characteristic of earth is cool and heavy, possessing the sound of great Brahmā. To always engage and maintain balance with this will bring the certain attainment of the nirmāṇakāya. To accomplish the sambhogakāya,  by listening to the sound of fire, this reveals the sound of the great Viṣhṇu. Whoever listens to this will certainly attain the qualities of the dharmakāya: the characteristics of wind are cool and fierce and carry the sound of uniting with the king[1] of birds. If one knows how to constantly practice this, then that is training with the common aspect of the three kāyas.” ( Reverberation of Sound Tantra)

￼My emphasis on the word "supreme" in the quote. Notice that each stage given above notes the common sound aspect and the supreme sound characterization of each element: "sound of water" - "sound (language) of the dākinīs," etc., except for earth, which doesn't commonly have a sound unless it's moving, so only the supreme aspect is pointed to (but look for low rumbles like kettle drums). The common sound aspect is given to characterize the inner resonances that one uses. Don't confuse the "four elements" with physical manifestations like waterfalls, fires, rocks pounded together, and wind. The supreme sound characterization is specified to make sure you don't make that error.

Place awareness on the related chakra associated with each element, gather the inner sound (which will be very subtle at first, thus "gather" it), and once gathered, draw it up to the next element by moving awareness. Do this in the order specified: Earth, Water, Fire, Wind (Air). Start with Fire though and bring it down to Earth, to ground yourself, since fire is associated with ego, and this isn't about you. Then continue, repeating fire in the correct location. The visions of the four lamps will naturally arise when you're ready, so no need to put your eyeballs at risk with a mudra as when the practice of Thögel is introduced.

This "preliminary" attains the "common aspects" of three kayas, and the common siddhis, and is a natural pathway into Thögel.

Malcolm wrote:
First, Reverberation of Sound is a completely incorrect (but common) translation, and it comes from a late attempt to normalize the titles of the 17 tantras by back translating them into Sanskrit in the Derge Nyingma Gyudbum. This mistake is absent from the Tshamdrag and Tingkye editions where the original, non-Sanskrit title is preserved.

The thal gyur in the title has to be translated separately. Thal ba, as explained in the tantra itself and the commentary, refers to buddhafields which are strewn with precious powder ( thal ba ). Gyur ba refers to the transformation of the elements.

Caffeine can have both positive and negative health effects. It can treat and prevent the premature infant breathing disorders bronchopulmonary dysplasia of prematurity and apnea of prematurity. Caffeine citrate is on the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines.[12] It may confer a modest protective effect against some diseases,[13] including Parkinson's disease[14] and certain types of cancer. One meta-analysis concluded that cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery disease and stroke is less likely with 3–5 cups of non-decaffeinated coffee per day but more likely with over 5 cups per day.[15] Some people experience insomnia or sleep disruption if they consume caffeine, especially during the evening hours, but others show little disturbance. Evidence of a risk during pregnancy is equivocal; some authorities recommend that pregnant women limit consumption to the equivalent of two cups of coffee per day or less.[16][17] Caffeine can produce a mild form of drug dependence – associated with withdrawal symptoms such as sleepiness, headache, and irritability – when an individual stops using caffeine after repeated daily intake.[1][3][5] Tolerance to the autonomic effects of increased blood pressure and heart rate, and increased urine output, develops with chronic use (i.e., these symptoms become less pronounced or do not occur following consistent use)

srivijaya said:
Hey! Okay, I get the message - don't beat me up guys!

On the OP though, the Two Truths Doctrine differs from *ahem* other Buddhism on a fundamental point (can't speak for Dzogchen though).

Briefly, Two Truths postulates a mistaken grasp of phenomena (ie. inherently existing). It sees the solution to this problem as breaking this illusion and seeing the underlying "nature" of self and other, as being emptiness. Furthermore emptiness gets called the ultimate state, which is a bit odd when you consider it carefully. Emptiness being the absence of inherent existence, rather than a "state" itself. Even the formulation 'form is empty, emptiness is form', equates the two. Equivalents cannot have one ultimate and the other not - it's like saying one half is larger than the other half. Quite how much of the Two Truths overlaps with Dzogchen, I have no idea, so if anyone can chip in, that would be great.

Rinpoche states again and again it is better to have bodhicitta based on recognition of one's real state then the contrived bodhicitta of common Mahāyāna. He is not saying bodhicitta is unnecessary, he is distinguishing contrived bodhicitta from authentic bodhicitta and the need to give rise to the latter rather than the former since the former is not stable and can disappear in a second.

For this reason, he uses the generation of bodhicitta that comes from the Anuyoga tantras:
I and all sentient beings
have always been buddhas;
recognizing this to be so, 
I generate supreme bodhicitta.

Astus said:
The Shurangama Sutra existed in China by around 730, if not earlier. Trisong Detsen, who invited Padmasambhava and Vimalamitra to Tibet, began his rule in 755. According to Sam van Schaik Dzogchen did not exist on its own until the 10th century, and Menngagde works date back only to the 11th century. In other words, not only sky gazing and leap over practices were nowhere around when the sutra appeared, but even Dzogchen has not yet formed.

Tsongkhapafan said:
In other words, Buddha did not teach Dzogchen. How then can it be a Buddhist practice? Buddha Shakyamuni predicted the appearance of Nagarjuna and Je Tsongkhapa but not Garab Dorje.

Coëmgenu said:
Do the words need to come out of the Buddha's mouth in exactly so-and-so order, in exactly such-and-such linguistic terminology and phrasing, to be, nonetheless, Buddha's teaching?

Take for instance the Heart Sutra. It is very unlikely that the Buddha himself said exactly those words in exactly that order, but Avalokiteśvara delivers Buddhavacana nonetheless, from a wide variety of sources, and condenses them into a succinct composite statement built from long but textually disparate Prajñāpāramitā Buddhavacana that was spoken by the Buddha (Buddha willing ), in so-and-so order and such-and-such terminology/phrasing, it is simply put in a new order for the purposes of expounding the heart of the wisdom-perfection teachings.

Is the Heart Sutra not Buddhavacana? I would say it is, despite not being said by the Buddha in exactly that phrasing originally.

The same could be true of Dzogchen teachings.

Astus said:
If one wants to establish a historical sequence, then it does not matter how old a tradition believes itself to be. What one should look for are datable and verifiable evidences. At the same time, it also means that one cannot say anything more than what the evidence can corroborate. So, for instance the Shurangama Sutra can be believed to be 2500 years old, but historically it is datable only to 8th century China. Similarly, Dzogchen may proclaim itself to go back to India, but the earliest texts are 9th century Tibet. To put it another way, who would believe today a person who claims to be the sole representative of an ancient Buddhist lineage nobody has yet heard of and nothing can back up its existence?

Malcolm wrote:

As for your first question. There are of course other differences, but the they are mainly technical, not practical.

However, the essential difference between Dzogchen and other systems is thögal. Otherwise, Mahāmudra, Lamdre, Trekchö and so on all have the same main point, equipoise in a moment of unfabricated consciousness aka tha mal gyi shes pa.

Astus said:
No. There are two interpretations of the four yogas I know of, and the more popular one among Kagyupas seems to be the view that one-pointedness is interpreted as the common practice of calming and concentration, while it is during simplicity / non-elaboration that one gains insight into the nature of mind. Accordingly, calming and insight are practised in order to gain knowledge, and only following that can one cultivate their unified form (the third yoga of one taste) based on the realisation.

The first is called "śamatha," because one cultivates an experience of a state of calmness. The second is called "vipaśyāna," because one recognizes that movement and calmness are identical in nature. These leads to the experience of their nonduality, and finally, the experience of natural perfection.

But all four of these samadhis are based on having had an experience of the nature of the mind based on direction introduction. In reality, these samadhis are not practiced gradually but are four qualities of equipoise on the nature of the mind.

It is a very common belief among Dzogchen teachers that Gampopa borrowed the four samadhis and changed their names, since he had started out as a Dzogchen practitioner. Further, Dzogchen teachers very often teach the four yogas of Mahāmudra when they teach sems sde, for example, Adzom Drugpa, Tulku Orgyen and so on.

The reason calming and insight is practised is to experience the nature of mind. The difference between sudden and gradual according to Tashi Namgyal is that those with supreme intellect do not need to practise calming but can directly gain insight following their familiarity with the teachings. Then, according to Thrangu rinpoche, the difference between common and special practice of calming and insight is that in Mahamudra one begins with insight into the nature of mind instead of insight into the nature of appearances. Finally, systematic instruction in calming and insight is more reliable and efficient according to him then pointing out instructions.

I'm not debating what you say about Mahamudra, but it seems to me that is a somewhat selective presentation. Furthermore, I consider those detailed instructions in the Mahamudra tradition of Gampopa an asset, and I'm not saying that it makes it anything inferior.

Firstly what is naga, naga is not a race of people, its an abode of knowledge~vidya, usually its mystic and always above ordinary understanding, the nagas were known as mystics, who reside in subterranean worlds as one description. Nagarjuna same as the Buddha has two dimensions, one in the human form and other as an abode of consciousness, Buddha is not just confined to Siddhartha and the knowledge that Nagarjuna had is not uniquely his, the sage Nagarjuna discovered that abode of knowledge .

Buddha Dharma is a discovery, an awakened discovery of things that are already are there. Naga is if we put in modern language a junction within the subtle body, when a nadi opens then certain forms of knowledge is revealed, this knowledge is universal and applies to all and all can have access to it via sadhana or skillful means., many lokas many abodes, all with varying degrees of illuminating knowledge,  So when the Buddha said that he keeps teachings with Naga's then he is meaning that they are stored in nagalands or deeper abodes or lokas, which are conscious and luminous and reside in all of us on a  subtle level and are universal applicable and accessible to everyone,  the sutras came from knowledge and illumination of that naga being experienced.

Is the Buddha in hell, yes he is in all states of consciousness but it may be covered by ordinary consciousness, Buddha is not created or a product of thought/meditation. It is said if one is bit by a naga then its a blessing.

,,,That is, Bhavaviveka must think that the only difference between Madhyamikas and non-Madhyamikas is that we have analyzed more deeply and worked out the correct implications of the common body of empirical evidence upon which all agree. In this way, Tsong-kha-pa argues, Bhavaviveka implies that intrinsic nature, just as it appears to our ordinary senses, does in fact exist conventionally.

Malcolm wrote:
You should realize that Newland's statements are obviously speculative and cannot be born out by examining what Bhavaviveka himself actually states in his criticism of Samkhya and Buddhapalita's argument against it. This is why, among non-Gelug Mādhyamikas, it is generally held that Bhavaviveka's arguments are more effective at refuting non-Buddhists, while Candrakīrtī's arguments are more persuasive against Buddhists. Further, since inherent existence appears to no-one, ever, anywhere, at anytime, and is a learned object of negation, Bhavaviveka confines the objet of refutation to the coarse object of refutation, existence.

By treating Bhavaviveka the way you do, you are effectively saying that everything is a nail, and so you will only use a hammer, when sometimes, in some cases, a saw is needed.

Jeff H said:
Point taken. Thank you.

I don't have the resources to bear out your position for myself, nor the inclination since my interest is in the point about subtle clinging to true existence rather than who said what. I have to mention that I consider Newland a reliable source for several reasons. I've read three of his books, listened to him lecture, my teachers hold him in high esteem, and he was the senior translating editor (under Joshua Cutler) for the Great Treastise project. The book I quoted from is his attempt to explicate some of Tsongkhapa's more difficult passages (in this case, he was talking about chapters 17-20).

In any case, I also consider you a reliable source and I appreciate you sharing your perspective.

Malcolm wrote:
There are two issues at stake here: one, your primary goal, which is to understand Tsongkhapa's perspective. In general, LRC is an excellent book. It is very detailed and interesting. The second issue, which should be of concern to everyone who cares about Madhyamaka in general, is the extent to which Tsongkhapa's use of the terms Prasanga and Svatantra actually reflect real positions in Indian Madhyamaka. If they do reflect substantive differences between Indian Madhyamakas, then the distinction becomes substantive. But if it is merely pedagogical, than the distinction is not substantive, apart from various Indian Madhyamakas who level against one another the charge of being making poor arguments, a trend begun by Bhavaviveka, rejected by Candra, who in turn was castigated for poor arguments by Jñānagarbha (in the Satdvayavibhanga ).

Frankly, apart from the religious dimension of Tsongkhapa's impact on Tibetan Buddhism, most of the research done on his thought has been by adherents with a vested interest in trying to defend his view rather than a critical appraisal to verify his claims. So it becomes an issue when this or that person boldly proclaims this or that to be the position of Prasangikas (who never existed in India), when in fact it is really just the postion of post 11th century Madhyamakas in Tibet who were trying to understand differences between the new fangled Madhyamaka introduced by Patshab Nyima Dragpa and the older Madhyamaka schools introduced during the Imperial period. This older, Tibetan Madhyamaka (Kadampas, 11and 12th century) indeed made many of the claims about intrinsic characteristics and so on Tsongkhapa rails against, but they did so in error, because they did not understand Madhyamaka perfectly. This is the reason why, for example, that Dzogchen authors like Rongzom castigate Kadampas in the 12th century for being too attached to characteristics in debate.

Thus, if your goal is understand Madhyamaka, this is one thing; if your goal is to understand Tsongkhapa, that is another. But don't mix these two goals up please.

So pristine mind is nothing more than stopping thinking?  Surely, at best, it's only a meditation on the conventional nature of the mind ('clarity'). It seems directionless and not very profound! (sorry!).

DGA said:
No, "clarity" in this context does not refer to the conventional nature of mind.  Here is a discussion in which one party promotes a meditation on a conventional object of mind, a so-called "generic image."

http://dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f=51&t=24334&start=60#p368782

I can't speak for Orgyen Chowang, but generally "clarity" is used to translate the Tibetan term lhundrub, which denotes something that is not limited to the conventional mind.  It would be worth your time to investigate the Tibetan concepts kadag and lhundrub.

If you are accustomed to the highly structured programs characteristic of a cult, then yes, this material will likely seem directionless and open-ended to you.
I can see that it's relaxing but Bodhichitta is far more splendorous and beneficial.
Are you referring to conventional or ultimate bodhicitta?  the answer to your question about clarity and the point I was making about lhundrub in some respects depends on your answer to this question

I certainly support Buddhist women who prefer not to have abortions. However, your notion that "lives have been lost" due to abortion is a religious opinion, not a universally agreed upon fact. Therefore, I cannot in good conscience seek to legislate laws that limit a women's right to choose what do to with her own body and the tissues that reside in it since not all women are Buddhists. But we live in a society where free speech is cherished, and so people who are against abortion for this and that reason have a right to speak out against the practice as long as they do so legally.

Engaged Buddhism, like liberation theology, is essentially a class-based interpretation of Buddhist social action, which seeks to bring fairness to all living beings (sentient and otherwise), not only human beings. As such, Buddhism also cannot support the ecological and economic irrationality of Capitalism and its oppressive practices anymore than it can support Communism. In practice therefore, engaged Buddhists tend to follow Deep Ecology.

Further, since inherent existence appears to no-one, ever, anywhere, at anytime, and is a learned object of negation, Bhavaviveka confines the objet of refutation to the coarse object of refutation, existence.

By treating Bhavaviveka the way you do, you are effectively saying that everything is a nail, and so you will only use a hammer, when sometimes, in some cases, a saw is needed.

In any case, Malcolm has been using literal meanings of individual words, while not taking into account the context, to interpret the meaning of passages. Go back to the beginning of this thread and anyone can see that this is exactly the case. Malcolm even argued that there is no such thing as "Madhyamika philosophy" based on linguistics, and he even argued that he had refuted the fact that the findings of quantum mechanics provide strong scientific evidence that Lama Tsongkhapa’s view that all things are empty of inherent existence because they are dependently originated is correct, although he apparently changed his mind later. Please recall this earlier post:

Malcolm wrote:
That has never been under question.

Kenneth Chan said:
This is truly strange. Now you admit that Lama Tsongkhapa's view that all things are empty of inherent existence because they are dependently originated is correct. As I have informed you, quantum mechanics is essentially a scientific finding that has been experimentally verified for over a century, which means that it is also correct.

Then why were you so adamant on trying to refute what I have repeatedly stated? And that is the fact that the findings of quantum mechanics provide scientific evidence that Lama Tsongkhapa's view that all things are empty of inherent existence because they are dependently originated is, in fact, correct.

Why did you repeatedly challenge this, and even go to the extent of claiming that you had refuted it (when you actually had not)? Even if you were unable to follow the reasoning behind how quantum mechanics provides evidence for Lama Tsongkhapa's view, surely you must have realized that it is just a matter of finding the correct way to connect the two, since both quantum mechanics and Lama Tsongkhapa's view are correct.
As Cloudburst correctly points out, there are some here who refuse to understand the Gelug point of view correctly by interpreting the words they use in the appropriate sense, i.e., according to what the Gelug texts actually mean by those words. This, unfortunately, calls into question the motivation behind such an attitude. I agree with Cloudburst's comments here below:

Matt J said:
But isn't the Gelug position summarized as:
The vase is not empty of the vase, it is empty of the inherent existence of the vase?

cloudburst said:
As always, the meaning of the words is what is important.
If you read my previous response to you, you will understand what "empty of inherent existence of the vase" means.

It's ludicrous to think that the view of Je Tsongkhapa is that phenomena are lacking something extraneous to themselves, but themselves are actually existent. This is the point of view of those not familiar with the Gelug point of view, and those insecure partisans who wish to aggrandize themselves and a particular school. I take you to be the former, others here as the latter.

It sounds to me like you have been reading the Center of the Sunlit Sky or similar, and relying on polemics to adequately express the views of the opponents of those polemics. These disputations are perhaps helpful in some respects to those who rely upon them, but really you cannot take the views posited therein as accurate. In many cases, they are simply representing an incorrect point of view and ascribing it to the opponent for the purposes of refutation. To really understand the Gelug pov on this you should consult Je Tsongkhapa's works.

Matt J said:
If the Gelugs are simply calling inherent existence what others call existence, and conventional existence what others call appearances, then there isn't an issue

cloudburst said:
I think that is actually the crux of it.
The main issue is no issue, although differences in this main issue create many subsidiary differences, but I dont believe these differences would obstruct either side from attaining liberation.

Kenneth Chan said:
This last point that Cloudburst makes is very important. Please remember that the purpose of the teaching on emptiness is to help us progress along the spiritual path. Since surely no one would dispute this, the onus is on us to try to understand the meaning being conveyed by the different traditions by accepting the terminology they use in the correct sense. Otherwise, we would be unnecessarily causing confusion which would work against the purpose of the teachings on emptiness, which is to help us progress along the spiritual path.

Malcolm wrote:
The point is that the Gelug school pretends they have the definitive take on the intention of Madhyamaka. It is this claim, among others, that is under dispute and always will be. The bearing that this has on your OP is your uncritical acceptence and dogmatic promulgation of a somewhat nihilistic understanding of Madhyamaka as a panacea for errors in physics that Madhyamaka was never intended to resolve since physics has nothing to do with liberation from suffering in samsara.

When those who seek liberation have analyzed it in every way, they do not observe a self, and thus [Nagarjuna’s Fundamental Treatise] says:

Georges Dreyfus calls the Prasangika's "realists", not because they advocate a material reality but because they ascribe validity to the workings of conventional reality. That is the context in which everyone other than buddhas do our work and pursue the path.

Malcolm wrote:
Please tell us upon what appearance a self is designated, and I will show the appearance that Candra rejects as a basis for designation a self. If Candra ever rejects designating a self on the basis of a consciousness, what else could there be left over? Nevertheless, Candra says this imputation of the nonexistent I is fully functional and can generate karma as well as experience its ripening.

Kenneth Chan said:
Malcolm, how did you come to the conclusion that "self and inherent existent are synonyms"? Please explain.

Also, what exactly do you mean by " valid basis" and " valid designation"? In terms of the ultimate truth, of course, we can say that there is no valid basis, no valid designation, no basis of designation, etc, etc. Because all things are empty of inherent existence, we can always say no this and no that, and no one can dispute it. But what exactly is the point you are trying to make?

Malcolm wrote:
The self proposed by ātmanāvadins is permanent, unchanging, and unconditioned, just the way inherent existence is defined.

As someone mentioned before, Bhavaviveka asserts that consciousness is a suitable conventional basis for designation a self, but Candra rejects this and asserts out there is no suitable basis for designating a self, even conventionally. Instead Candra says that I-making is a habit which imputes a nonexistent. He also claims this habit is capable of generating karma and experiencing its ripening. The habit of course is a dependently originated phenomena, but the I which it imputes does not exist at all. Likewise, the imputation of inherent existence arises in dependence, but that imputation is a false one, like the imputation of self.

Tsongkhapafan said:
Self and inherent existence are not synonyms. Inherent existence does not exist but the self clearly does as it can perform actions. The self of Buddha benefits all each and every living being every day.

It's a big mistake to conflate the merely imputed self with an inherently existent self. Those who are unable to tell the difference will definitely fall into the extremes of inherent existence and non-existence, as you have done.

Malcolm wrote:
The imputation of a self exists I.e., the conception exists, but it is a false imputation since it has no valid basis of designation. The proposition of a self is exactly the same as proposing inherent existence. The refutation of one is the refutation of the other.

In other words, the negation of the self does not confirm a merely existing self. It merely points to its absence in the aggregates, and so on.

This is also why existence is included in inherent existence sui generis. The Buddha said it is fine to use say "self" as long as one understood nothing real was indicated. It is the same with the term existence.

You were getting at this before but I didn't understand.

Also - if a basis of designation is merely an aggregate, is it not posssible for a "sense of self" to conventionally exist, like a thought? I'm not sure what the difference would be between that kind of "sense of self" and "awareness" or "self-awareness" in its ordinary sense.

It seems difficult to me to embrace all that under Nagarjuna's second lemma. What is the proper understanding of it?

On the whole, I think Verardi's thesis is reductionist, wrong-headed and naive. He shows no understanding of Tantric Buddhism at all.

I find this rather hard to believe. Buddhism certainly was on a decline cycle from the 5th century (collapse of WRE destroying trade with Europe etc) but Buddhism was respected enough to be adopted by the mandala surrounding India up throuh the tantric period. Indonesia, the Maldives, Cambodia, Tibet all adopted Buddhism long after the 5th century.

Muhammad Ghuri was in fact the first Central Asian ruler who projected Muslim power beyond the Punjab.

And in order to secure their hold on power they followed the age-old Muslim custom of temple destruction. Although it is now known that the claims of such destruction are vastly inflated in Muslim conquest literature as well as in Hindu and Buddhist histories, we do know that at least eighty temples were destroyed during this period. 32 Two of these destroyed temples were Buddhist. 33

Harvey also points out in this book, that Theravada survived in in South Indian Tamil Nadu until the 12th century. Far from the islamic invasions. This also makes evidence of the disputes between Buddhism and tamilian Shaivism. May shaivite tales tell of how shaivite saints defeated buddhist monks with miracles etc. That's why I don't bite in the hindutva proposal of Indian religions being all one same thing.

But besides Buddhism in the case of Tamil Nadu, why also Janism also survived only under the protection of mostly hindu rulers in the deccan plateau? Like Buddhism, it almost vanished from north/central India, Kashmir, Bengal, Bihar (its birthplace like Buddhism) etc ?Another question to think about!

What about classical indian/hindu culture, like classical dance, sculpture, architecture, in many ways it has disappeared from North India? Things like chola bronzes, city temples like madurai and hampi? Classical dance like bharatanatyam, odissi or charya nritya, only survived in places much less affected by muslim rulership. Instead the monuments of the north are the Taj Mahal, Agra, Delhi Mosque etc.
At its peak Nalanda had an extensive faculty teaching a diverse student body of about three thousand on a beautiful campus composed of numerous cloisters with lofty spires that “resembled the snowy peaks of Mount Sumeru.” 3 Then suddenly the serenity of this Buddhist institution was shattered. In the fall of 1202, Muslim soldiers on horses rode in and hacked down teachers and students where they stood. The once majestic buildings were left in ruins. 4 The savagery was so great it signaled the end of the Dharma in India. This powerful story has been told countless times. Today it is ubiquitous, being found in everything from scholarly monographs to travel brochures. Indeed, by its sheer pervasiveness, this one episode has in many ways come to encapsulate and symbolize the entire thirteen-hundred-year history of Buddhist-Muslim interaction. And on account of this, whenever the topic of Buddhism and Islam is ever mentioned it almost invariably revolves around the Muslim destruction of the Dharma. 5 This is problematic for many reasons, not the least being that the story of Nalanda is not true. For example, not only did local Buddhist rulers make deals with the new Muslim overlords and thus stay in power, 6 but but Nalanda also continued as a functioning institution of Buddhist education well into the thirteenth century. 7

But its worth noting that Buddhism survived in South Asia In regions that were quite far from muslim invasions and subsequent muslim rule. This is the case of Sri Lanka and Nepal. Much like the classical hindu culture, high culture, is also much more better kept in these places, as Nepal and Tamil Nadu. Not that I don't agree with you and Namdrol in most point, specially when you considere the survival of Jainism and its ties to royal patrons.

Verardi says that Buddhism and Brahmanism had a back-and-forth dialectic for centuries, in periods where international trade flourished, Buddhism gained power, when it declined, Brahmanism was on the ascendant. Islam disrupted this balance as it was also a mercantile-based religion which displaced Buddhism.

So yes, Brahmans obviously were opposed to Buddhism, but to say Islam had no effect on the demise of Buddhism in India is absurd. The Kalachakra writers clearly recognised what was a greater threat to them early on, and it wasn't the Brahmans per se.

And that is just the written form of the sūtra. It could have predated that as oral teachings, passed from master-to-student individually, or memorized in monastic academies. So it isn't too much of a stretch to think that Nāgārjuna, at the time that he was writing his early treatises, could have believed in and been aware of the present-day form of the Tathāgatagarbha-teaching, there just isn't any way to prove that using the historical record.

I might be wrong about this, but Tathagatagarbha is presented mainly in Buddha's Third Turning of the Wheel of Dharma when he taught the Chittamatrin view. Nagarjuna was more of Second Turning of the Wheel guy (when Buddha taught mainly the Perfection of Wisdom Sutras that are the source of the Mahayana teachings) which are considered to be Sutras of definitive meaning; Tathagatagarbha is not considered as definitive (although some traditions may disagree) so I doubt Nagarjuna had much to say about it.

Malcolm wrote:
Longchenpa considers the definitive view to be Prasaṅga Madhyamaka and the definitive sūtras to be the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras.

But in reality this interpretation of the three turnings comes from a Korean commentary on the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra preserved in the Tibetan canon. There is no evidence the Indian masters ever paid any serious attention to this idea. It is mostly a Tibetan obsession inspired by a Korean guy.

The Sakya Master Loppon Sonam Tsemo has the best approach when he cites one of the commentary tantras of the Guhyasamaja, which to paraphrase states, the single vajra word is heard by different people of different capacities who wrote down different meanings according to what they heard the Buddha say.

From one viewpoint, this is true, but the Perfection of Wisdom Sutras are also the source of the lamrim instructions presented by Atisha, Gampopa, Je Tsongkhapa and other Teachers, so Madhyamaka not really all about negation. If you know what the Dharma is not implicitly you know what it is.

Now you are conflating two different systems: Madhyamaka, which is a method for eradicating wrong views in Buddhadharma, and the Abhisamayālaṃkara, which is a Yogacāra work on the Prajñāpāramita Sūtras that brilliantly, but rather arbitrarily, imposes a structure of paths and stages on the Prajñāpāramita Sūtras. It is important to take note of the fact that Tibetan Tradition has selected the Madhyamaka interpretation of this work (those of Ārya Vimktisena and Haribhadra, etc.) over the Yogacāra commentators on this work (Vasubandu, etc.).

The spiritual path in Buddhism does not depend on belief. The clearest illustration of this is the fact that even if we genuinely and strongly believe everything that the Buddha taught, we are still not enlightened. Mere belief achieves very little other than serve as an incentive to actually embark on the spiritual path.

This process of verification on the spiritual path—by direct personal experience brought about by a progressive transformation of our being—is, of course, very different from the experimental verification of science. Nonetheless it is a process of verification. Thus, it means that both Buddhism and science are investigations of reality based on the principle of verification.

If what you say is true, why don't we just follow our attachment and anger then? Since there is no difference between them and the path to awakening (because a delusion is a delusion) that would work just as well by your logic.

Furthermore, delusion is not possible at all? That's nonsense. Wrong awarenesses clearly exist and function.

You need to read Haribhadra on this point. What he says, in essence, is that the path and everything in it, up to Buddhahood is an illusion, a false appearance, and when we attain buddhahood, we look back and realize we were never deluded to begin with. In other words, we are illusory sentient beings following an illusory path to attain an illusory buddhahood which in the end we realize we never needed to follow. Why? Just as when one understands that an illusory elephant is just a trick of the eyes created by the magician, likewise, one understands that all of samsara and nirvana are just tricks created by afflictions. When one sees through the trick, one recognizes that the elephant never existed; likewise, when one attains buddhahood, one recognizes one was never deluded.

Science is a discipline that necessarily should be free from religious and political ideology even if politicians and religious people do not like the results of imperfect empirical observation. Buddhadharma is not scientific, is not a science, and it is a mistake to regard it as such.

For example, we have such Advaita sentiments as:

Kenneth Chan said:
This then is the final meaning of Advaita Vedanta. The same Absolute Substance, called the Brahman, is the origin of both our material universe and our consciousness, and this Brahman can be experienced within our consciousness, and this is the spiritual goal of our life.

You can find much discussion of such things out there. We can find out that Schrödinger wrote in his book My View of the World: “In all the world, there is no kind of framework within which we can find consciousness in the plural; this is simply something we construct because of the temporal plurality of individuals, but it is a false construction….The only solution to this conflict in so far as  any is available to us at all lies in the ancient wisdom of the Upanishad.”

So again, you find confirmation of QP in the doctrine of the Perfection of Wisdom, Schrödinger and Heisenberg in the Upanishads, and then we have the very well funded ID community, lead by the Templeton Foundation. It is normal that people wish to find confirmation of their religious beliefs in science, and indeed, that is HHDL's main intent. I personally think is better to let religions be religions, politics be politics, and science be science.

I will say one thing, as I dont usually do the challenges on etymology, as English for one isn't  the best language to convey all these concepts, plus the modern education system of learning isn't the best platform to copy how dharma is learned or expressed. Seems one of my post was not approved due to double clicking

All Dharma Shastra includes experience, or the experiencer, its not an objective study. Sama is the neutral, the equanimity that keeps calm and poise, this is conscious and as you say a neutral mental factor, samatha is calm abiding, but that is nothing unless vipassana happens, just feeling calm and equi[osed is not enough, one wouldnt know how to discriminate or operate even in this world with the faculty of intelligence, but when dhi is combined with sama to make samadhi then the supra mental faculty, or the higher faculty that understand dharma is united with t hat ground of equanimity to break down the defilement, so sama and dhi are in union at all times of its a real experience of samadhi, and all of this can only be known via experience, via sila, good character and culture to bring balance to the mind. I think people nowadays are well aware that unskillful habits leads to suffering for oneself and others and should be given up to experience higher states of mind, that dont really need to be analysed literally. But why would dhi be considered as part of the supra mental faculty, why not ordinary intelligence ? can dharma be approached by the normal faculty of intelligence, scholars and academics who dont practice dont seem to be getting the right understanding, would you agree ?

I do not really see much of a difference from you said to me, in texts usually the context is kept pure, so without going into to many variations of the translation of the word samadhi as there are many levels expressed in different traditions, as  the experience can only be one. If we stick for the time being as sama as equanimity or balance and dhi as you mention to hold still holds the same context, what would be holding that sama or equanimity it would then again be that supra mental faculty, or intellect that holds the mind by superior knowledge in the state of sama, so even though sama and dhi make up the compound they are always in union.

When you say that both correct and false relative truths are mere appearances you are claiming they have equal status. But you qualify the latter as "functional." Thus you are making the claim that these appearances are more real than the others.

It would be better for you to say that correct relative truth is mere existence, while false relative truth is mere appearance, as opposed to true nonexistents like the sons of barren women and hairy turtles which have no causes for arising.

This is the point of my saying your understanding of delusion is not subtle enough. Candra is quite clear: all relative truths are objects of false cognitions. This means that even conventional truths are actually delusions, subtle delusions, as opposed to coarse delusions.

I believe in the contest of miracles between the buddhists and the bön priests, even Guru Padma distinguishes between siddhis which can be witnessed by everyone and those than can be experienced only by those to posess clairvoiance. But I don't have the book at hand, so maybe it was the author who wrote that.

Recently, while perusing Sam van Schaik's blog, https://earlytibet.com/2010/12/13/secrets-of-the-cave-i/, I discovered that apparently there is a longer form of Buddha Amitāyus' name: Aparamitāyus.

As far as I can tell, the initial element means "Unrivaled," according to http://www.sanskrita.org/wiki/index.php?title=apara#.E0.A4.85.E0.A4.AA.E0.A4.B0.C2.A0a-para_.5B_apara_.5D: अपर a-para [ apara ]
1 mfn. having nothing beyond or after, having no rival or superior
Can anyone confirm or deny this?  My knowledge of Sanskrit is certainly much more limited than some on here.

Obvioulsy the name should not be parsed a-paramita-ayus, since this would mean something like "not-transcending-life," though the syllables 'paramita' in this longer form is what first jumped out at me.

Aparamita means beyond estimate. Thus Aparamitāyus means life span beyond measure or estimate.

That is why, in Madhyamika philosophy, we say that this object is empty of inherent existence—its very existence depends on causes and conditions (represented by the quantum wave function ) and depends upon the mind that apprehends it (which is the experiential event that occurs in the act of observation). There is no such object without this dependent origination via these factors.]

But this assertion is in itself not correct. Designations are dependent on appearances. But appearances are not dependent on designations. Designations do not bootstrap appearances into existence.

Further, you are making an assertion of parabhāva, other or dependent existence. We have already discussed this before.

Yogacāra is not solipsism, it is not even remotely close to solipsism. Yogacāra argues for the existence of separate mind streams. It negates external phenomena (in various ways, not all Yogacārins absolutely reject external phenomena), but not separate mind streams.


Kenneth Chan said:
Yes, I know Yogacara is not solipsism. That's why I only said that it "may be too close to solipsism." The problem is that, like solipsism, it negates external reality (although perhaps not absolutely).

Malcolm wrote:
It is not close at all. Yogacāra is called "cittamatra" following the method they use to discover ultimate truth. However, the ordinary things of everyday existence which are included in the imagined nature still function, like cars, etc. "Cittamatra" is a method of ultimate analysis they use.

The way in which external reality functions in the Yogacāra analysis is very complex and subtle, and beyond any discussion here. But because it is complex and subtle, and because the basic concepts to which they refer are found in the Buddhas sūtras, Madhyamakas were compelled to comment on them to remove misconceptions Madhyamakas felt Yogacārins had introduced in the latter's explanations.

So for example, if the Buddha had taught a sūtra on quantum physics, then Madhyamakas might have some business commenting on the same. But since he didn't, I still maintain that QP is properly outside the domain of proper Buddhist discourse because it can only be speculative, a thicket of views.

Kenneth Chan said:
Another problem with solipsism is the fact that all the different minds seem to agree with what is happening in the external world. They all perceive the same blue sky, the same green grass, and the same events happening in the external world. How is this agreement possible if everything is only happening in each of their minds? Why would these events be correlated at all?

Malcolm wrote:
In the Yogacāra model all external perceptions of the three realms is accounted for by traces (vasanas) which exist in the mind streams of sentient beings. These vasanas are traces of actions and act as seeds which when meeting special conditions ripen into karmic appearances. Because these traces are so deep, sentient beings in general never question appearance of their common container universe. It is more detailed than this, but this is a brief overview of how it works.

This means that all collective appearances arise from common karmic traces, while individual appearances arise from specific traces. Thus all hell beings share common traces to experience a hell realm, but the individual suffering of each one is based on traces unique to that individual.

At that point I had never done single deity Vajrasattva in my Sakya practices ever.  You can actually enter Sakya practice and do Sakya sadhanas for years and not encounter the single deity Vajrasattva form.  I'm not saying that everyone will have this expereince though.  If you are introduced to Sakya ngondro right away then you definitely get the single form.  But it is very common to get the typical tantric introductory initiations (Hevajra or Chakrasamvara and Vajrayogini), practice that and really just do Atisha's refuge prayer with extensive sutra lineage study for a long time.  And then later begin ngondro.

There is great compatibility. I have a degree in physics and I find it interesting that particles can sometimes act as particles and sometimes as waves, for example.

They do not act as particles or waves, they are best described sometimes as particles or sometimes as waves.

We have two contradictory pictures of reality; separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena of light, but together they do."

And of course, there is still no absolute consensus on the issue, with some contemporary 21st century physicists arguing that in reality all we are observing is particles, and others arguing that all we are observing is pure waves of matter. Thus, I really do not see how any version of Madhyamaka is going to help this situation along.

"Objects of knowledge posited by the mind as existent and nonexistent;
Valid forms of knowledge dependent on objects true and false.
Having seen that the source of falsity in one is entrusted to the other,
I am uncomfortable about positing the validity of convention.

The presentation of the unexamined, unanalyzed world;
The systems of tenets that examine and analyze.
Having seen that the foundation of one rests on the other,
I am uncomfortable about positing the validity of convention.

Illusions that are mere appearances to the mind;
The mode of being determined to be real.
Having seen that if one is true, the other is false,
I am uncomfortable about positing the validity of convention.

The first speaker hides the mountain of his own faults;
His opponent searches for the other’s faults with a needle.
Having seen them take turns defeating each other,
I am uncomfortable about positing the validity of convention.

The nonobservation of what is suitable to appear negates the extreme of existence;
The nonobservation of what does not appear abandons the extreme of nonexistence.
Having seen that the presentation of one is destroyed by the other,
I am uncomfortable about positing the validity of convention.

Because there is no difference in the attachment produced
By the conception of true existence that holds a friend to be real and
By the valid knowledge which understands that friends are helpful,
I am uncomfortable about positing the validity of convention.

Having seen no difference in the hatred produced
By the conception of real existence that holds an enemy to be true and
By the valid knowledge which determines that enemies are harmful,
I am uncomfortable about positing the validity of convention.

Inferential valid knowledge is produced from direct perception;
Inference analyzes whether direct perception is true or false.
Because the child is serving as the father’s witness,
I am uncomfortable about positing the validity of convention.

Analysis by reasoning depends on the founders’ systems;
The founders are established by the power of reasoning.
If I can decide on my own, whom should I follow?
If I cannot decide, on whom can I rely?

Correct reasoning is found in definitive scriptures;
The provisional and definitive are distinguished by stainless reasoning.
If one understands with reasoning, why search for definitive meaning?
If one does not understand with reasoning,
how does one find definitive meaning?

Because of this way in which Maitreyanātha was seen as a female dog,
I do not believe in the unanalyzed, innate mind.
Because of this way in which the views of Madhyamaka and Cittamātra
abbots contradict each other,
I do not believe in the minds of analytical scholars.

Vulgar people, having repeatedly followed what is right,
Find the innate conception of true existence; it is the root of all downfall.
Scholars, having repeatedly followed what is right,
Find the artificial conception of true existence; it is worse than that.

In this world where there resounds the noise of debate
About existence and nonexistence, is and is not, true and false,
Whatever is constantly seen appears as an object of knowledge.
Whatever one has always known appears to be valid.

Whatever most people like appears as the truth;
Whatever most mouths agree on appears as dogma.
Inside each person is a different valid form of knowledge,
With an adamantine scripture to support it.

Beyond each mountain pass is a different religious sect
With thousands of scholars and fools who follow, saying,
“Just this is true; this will not deceive you.”

This self-authorization of one’s own truth
Delights a group of like-minded beings.
When told to a group that does not agree, they are scornful.

Here in the capital of six types of beings who cannot agree,
What is asserted by ten is not asserted by a hundred;
What is seen by humans is not seen by gods.
Who makes the laws that validate truth and falsity?”

It seems to me the semantics here would be resolved if we distinguish between the method of madhyamaka and the Madhyamaka School, according to the tenet systems tradition.

This quote from The Presentation of Tenets by Jetsün Chökyi Gyaltsen (trans. Glen Svensson) indicates that Madhyamikas (proponents of the Madhyamaka tenet system) utilize madhyamaka (the method of non-affirming negation) to further the Mahayana. “Propounding Great Vehicle tenets” means following Mahayana. The non-affirming negation of true establishment is a distinguishing method for this school, but it doesn’t eliminate the assertion of the Mahayana.

Malcolm wrote:
Yogacara and Madhyamaka represent to different approaches to Mahāyāna, so we agree on that much. The former is constructionist, in that they engage in many detailed explanations and the elaborations of positions based on the Buddha's teachings found principally in the Samdhinirocana Sūtra, Lankāvatāra Sūtra and so on. The latter is deconstructionist, principally following the prajñāpārāmita sūtras. There is of course a third school, the Tathātagarbha school which is based on the ten tathāgatagarbha sūtras, but in terms of treatises it is represented only by the Uttaratantra, its commentary, and some texts attributed to Nāgārjuna.

The point is that neither of these three schools promote a separate path. All three schools promote the same path, with different understandings of consciousness and reality, and different methodologies for ascertaining the same. Madhyamaka's approach, as you correctly note, is strictly critical.

I am afraid your reply here still does not answer the question why you have such a problem with a Madhyamika philosophy that considers the conventional truth as crucial.

Malcolm wrote:
Madhyamaka is not a philosophy. It does not set forth its own propositions. For example, the Buddha proposes that there are two truths. This is not a Madhyamaka proposition. The idea of the two truths is also addressed in Abhidharma. Madhyamaka merely corrects Abdhidharma misconceptions about the two truths. For example, Buddha taught mind-only, the three natures and the all-basis consciousness in the so called Yogacara sūtras. Candrakīrti did not invent these ideas, but he endeavors to correct Yogacara misinterpretations of these teachings.

Unknown said:
It does not explain why you are so against any suggestion that Madhyamika philosophy has anything directly to do with the spiritual path that necessarily requires bodhicitta (I say this because you repeatedly argue that Madhyamika philosophy is not concerned with the conventional truth).

Kenneth Chan said:
I have never suggested that Madhyamaka has nothing to do with the spiritual path. The elimination of incorrect views is crucial to the path. What I stated was that the Madhyamaka focus was on the elimination of wrong views; that it, Madhyamaka, is a critical method and not a philosophy. Madhyamaka does not set forth propositions or claims about anything. As Buddhapalita so clearly states, Madhyamaka does not make the claim that this or that does not exist; it merely removes claims that this or that exists without the need for adding the qualifier "inherently."

Malcolm wrote:
Since, as you say, “the elimination of incorrect views is crucial to the path,” Madhyamika philosophy must definitely be concerned with the spiritual path.
One, there is no Madhyamaka philosophy since Madhyamaka does not make propositions about things. Madhyamaka does not set forth either an epistemological theory nor an ontological theory. It merely shows an opponent the inherent contradictions which are a consequence (prasaṅga) of their own assertions without putting forth any counter assertions.


Kenneth Chan said:
While you admit that the Madhyamaka masters are concerned with the spiritual path, you insist that the word “Madhyamaka” must, nonetheless, be restricted to mean “the elimination of wrong views,” and that the word “Madhyamaka” must be strictly and only used to mean “a critical method” and must never be used to mean "a philosophy."

Malcolm wrote:
Yes.

Kenneth Chan said:
So this means that your motivation is over semantics and the correct usage of words. If this is not so, can you now clarify exactly what your motivation is?

Malcolm wrote:
My personal motivation is that people understand what Madhyamaka is and what it is not. It is a critical method used to prune wrong views. It is not a spiritual philosophy nor does it make any propositions of its own. It serves strictly as a critical method for removing misconceptions about what the Buddha taught, that's all.

So for example, when you proclaim that Madhyamaka philosophy solves the mystery of quantum physics, this is wrong on two counts: 1) Madhyamaka is not a philosophy, since as explained above it make no propositions of its own. 2) Madhyamaka has no role in confirming mundane theories such as quantum physics, much less karma. If Madhyamaka is to play a role in quantum physics, it would be merely to show that propositions in quantum physics suffer from internal contradictions if and when quantum physicists make ultimate truth claims that contradict the teachings of the Buddha (i.e. claiming there is arising from self, other, both or without a cause). To the extent that they do not do this, Madhyamaka has no interest in quantum physics.

If I had a thesis, I would be at fault;
since I alone have no thesis, I alone am without fault.

So your motivation is simply on the basis of how you choose to interpret Nagarjuna's words?
But there are many different ways of interpreting any words. Perhaps I am wrong but it appears to me that your motivation may be something else.
That is your speculation, something which I am not able to control.

Kenneth Chan said:
Otherwise, just consider this. If your interpretation happens to be incorrect (especially since many people, including Madhyamaka masters, disagree with your interpretation), and you are forcibly pushing this onto everyone else, you may end up doing more harm than good.

Kenneth Chan said:
Without entering into refuge on the Buddha's path, one is not following a correct path. Without developing the aspiration for supreme awakening, one is following a lower path. Without understanding that all phenomena are natureless, free from the four extremes, nonarising and inexpressible, one will be subject to conceptual proliferation and be long delayed in attaining buddhahood— as Mañjuśrī said Sachen, "If grasping arises, one does not have the view."

Malcolm wrote:
How is any of this a problem with a Madhyamika philosophy that considers the conventional truth as crucial?
As I pointed out, there are only four uses of the term "convention" in the MMK.

The concern for creating a perfect conventional truth is very much confined to the Gelugpa school. Of course, as we see, Gelugpas like TKfan ignore conventional truth whenever it suits them to do so, such as proclaiming with absolute certainty that Nāgārjuna lived for 600 years and expressing shock at the idea that a traditional story might a legend rather than a historical fact.

Kenneth Chan said:
It does not explain why you are so against any suggestion that Madhyamika philosophy has anything directly to do with the spiritual path that necessarily requires bodhicitta (I say this because you repeatedly argue that Madhyamika philosophy is not concerned with the conventional truth).

Malcolm wrote:
I have never suggested that Madhyamaka has nothing to do with the spiritual path. The elimination of incorrect views is crucial to the path. What I stated was that the Madhyamaka focus was on the elimination of wrong views; that it, Madhyamaka, is a critical method and not a philosophy. Madhyamaka does not set forth propositions or claims about anything. As Buddhapalita so clearly states, Madhyamaka does not make the claim that this or that does not exist; it merely removes claims that this or that exists without the need for adding the qualifier "inherently." This also does not preclude those who write about Madhyamaka from writing about other issues, such as the Bodhisattva path, Abhidharma, Vajrayāna and so on, for example, Śantideva wrote not only the Bodhicaryāvatara, but also the Compendium of Training (Śiksasammucaya). Nāgārjuna I wrote not only on Madhyamaka, but he also wrote a short text on Ayurveda called the Jivasūtra, as well as a detailed discourse on Mahāyāna training called Ratnavali. You should read it, it is really quite remarkable.

It is essential to combine wisdom and compassion on the spiritual path to enlightenment, and that is why conventional truth is crucial in Madhyamika philosophy. Let me quote from the book “Relative Truth, Ultimate Truth” by Geshe Tashi Tsering:

“Understanding conventional truth enables the practitioner to develop the method side—compassion, concentration, and ethics—whereas understanding the ultimate truth leads to the wisdom side—emptiness. These realizations will, in turn, result in the two Buddha bodies, the truth body and the form body.

People who want to be free from suffering need to cultivate an understanding of reality, the wisdom of ultimate truth, while developing the method side of the practice, which entails a thorough understanding of conventional truth. There is no other way.”

Malcolm wrote:
There are virtually no Madhayamaka texts which illustrate the bodhisattva path. This is because Madhyamaka and Yogacara present the same path; while having differences over the nature of consciousness and reality. The texts by Madhyamaka authors that treat the path (the Abhisamayālaṃkara literature) are taxonomic, and do not present a path different than that of the Yogacara masters since the Abhisamayālaṃkara was written by a Yogacara master, Maitreyanatha.

The collection of reasoning and the praises of Nāgārjuna are entirely critical. One might imagine Āryadeva's 400 to be a path text. In reality, it engages in what you would like to call "conventional analysis" for the first four chapters and ultimate analysis for the final four chapters. But in general, it does not present a path. It is wholly concerned with correcting misconceptions.

It is really only Śantideva that presents a Madhyamaka path text, and to a lesser extent, Nāgārjuna's Ratnavali.

But for the most part, Nāgārjuna and other Madhyamakas are concerned only with refuting the mistaken views of others without putting forward some unique view called "Madhyamaka." They are instead attempting to critically restore the Buddha's middle way.

Am I right? If so, why are you so insistent on this?

Malcolm wrote:
If you want to look at Nāgārjuna's writing on the Mahāyan̄a path, they really are only to be found in three texts which we can be certain were written by Nāgārjuna I: the Mahāyānavimsika, the Ratnavali and the Suhṛllekha. Of these three, the first barely mentions the Mahāyāna path at all, but focuses mainly on a nonpolemical exposition of the view of Prajñāpārāmita. Ratnavali has an extensive presentation of Mahāyāna view and practice, and the Suhṛllekha mainly focuses on such things as the need the practice the ten virtues, the results of negative actions and so on.

Otherwise, it is quite difficult to ascertain which of over 300 texts in the bstan 'gyur were authored by Nāgārjuna I since they are never mentioned anywhere by later Madhyamaka authors or cited by them. Then of course there are Chinese translations, but they are beyond the scope of our discussion.

However the Madhyamaka texts we do have that everyone accepts are authored by Nāgārjuna leave no details on how to practice Mahāyāna, I therefore contend that Madhyamaka is strictly a critical method to eliminate wrong views.

For example, in his autocommentary, Candrakīrti devotes very little time to an exposition of anything other than the sixth bhumi. He devotes 12 folios to the first five bhumis, 40 folios on the sixth bhumi, and another 12 folios on the bhumis 7-10. In other words, he devotes two thirds of his entire text to one bhumi.

People have no problem negating an illusory elephant. It is also mere appearance. The problem comes about when one uses the term "mere existence."

It is instructive to note that the term conventional truth appears nowhere in Nāgārjuna's writing. He does not according truth status to mundane conventions, he merely advises in the analysis on karma that they should not be be violated (for obvious reasons), and that they should be employed in order to make it possible to understand ultimate truth. In fact, the term "convention" appears only four times in the whole of the MMK.

the Madhyamika  understands conventional reality, does not dismiss it

the whole point is to blow away both simultaneously and maintain a middle view by seeing the empty nature of all things.
to blow away the concept of inherency and the concept of nihilism . which brings you to a view that everything is empty .

even emptiness is empty , and that awareness is also empty .

to deny conventional reality and dismiss it, is fanatical , taking something to the extreme and missing the entire point of the philosophy.

These are good points, thanks for making them. The whole idea that Madhyamaka is just about emptiness is incorrect, as emptiness cannot exist alone without conventional reality.

the truth is so many assertions and contradictions have been asserted and dropped in this conversation that is would be impossible for someone who was not already versed in these issues  to make any sense of it.

Do you recommend that we should accept that Nagarjuna, the prototypical Madhyamika, accepts the law of the excluded middle?

Malcolm wrote:
Ah, typos. Gotta love em.

"there will however be non-existence"

You can find this in the Hopkins translation.

It seems that Nāgārjuna accepts the law of the excluded middle as well as the law of noncontradiction conventionally, except in the case of the four fold negation, or with respect to the https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/contradiction/#LNCBudTet.

The problem is that your view is coarse and so you are unable to make a distinction between the mode of existence that normally appears to the minds of sentient beings (inherent existence), and mere appearance, mere imputation.

Malcolm wrote:
Inherent existence is not a mode of appearance that appears to any sentient being's mind. This is your basic mistake. Appearances are not imputations; instead imputations are based on appearances. Therefore, the coarse object of negation, existence, is sufficient.

For example, when we negate the existence of an illusion, we are negating the appearance itself. The elephant in an illusion is not an elephant. We are not negating some inherently existing elephant in the illusion, we are saying in that appearance of an elephant is not an elephant. All phenomena can be understood the same way.

Tsongkhapafan said:
Thus your object of negation 'existence' is too general and is also negating mere appearance. Negating something that does exist is a wrong view.

Since existence is included in inherent existence, and since you claim inherent existence never existed, for you also existence never existed. You must accept this consequence.

Bakmoon's comments are correct. Negation of inherent existence establishes the non-existence of inherent existence (it never has existed). It is not non-existence that is being negated, it's the inherent existence of lack of inherent existence that is being negated. We are not negating emptiness, merely its falsely appearing as inherently existent. Thus one is realising the non-true existence of emptiness such that emptiness itself is not grasped as something.

When you negate existence, it is not so much a negation as a not finding. When analyzed, things are not found to exist, not exist, both and neither, both in the relative and the ultimate. We don't negate existence, but when sought, it is not found.

Kenneth Chan said:
This means that you essentially agree that we do not “negate existence in its entirety.” You are just putting the same meaning in different words, and placing the emphasis on this idea that “it is not so much a negation as a not finding.” Nonetheless it means that we do not negate existence in its entirety. You are just using a different interpretation of the word “negate.”

Malcolm wrote:
When something is not proven and is completely unfindable when sought, we can conclude it is nonexistent. Thus, when an existent thing is not proven and cannot be found when sought, we can concluded it is nonexistent. For example, when a mirage appears we search for the water in that place where the mirage appears, we can conclude that mirage is an appearance of water that does not exist. Of course the mirage arises because of causes and conditions, but if we assume that the mirage exists, this represents a limitation of our analysis. It is not a conventional analysis, it is a defective ultimate analysis.


Kenneth Chan said:
The next part of your comment is also another case of a difference in the interpretation of words. In this case, we are talking about the word “analysis.” It is important to make the distinction between analysis concerning the ultimate truth (ultimate analysis) and analysis concerning only conventional matters (conventional analysis). Here, Malcolm, you are mixing up these two forms of analysis in your use of words. Let us look closely at your comment line by line.

Malcolm wrote:
When we use analysis in Buddhadharma, we are not engaged in conventional anlysis; we are always engaged in ultimate analysis. Why? Because all analysis is a search for the real. An analysis which is incomplete is a faulty analysis.

However, what Nāgārjuna show is that some kinds of analysis are defective. For example, Vasubandhu states that truths are cognitions: a relative truth is an appearance that has not been analyzed, such as water; ultimate truths are analytical cognitions of those appearances, for example, ascertaining that water is limpid, cool, and wet. Thus, for Sautrantikas following the scriptures, these svalakṣanas, intrinsic characeristics are ultimate (paramartha satyas) because they represent the final limit of analysis. However, from a Madhyamaka point of view, these are not conventional analysis, these are defective ultimate analysis. See for example Nāgārjuna's analysis of the five dhātus.


Kenneth Chan said:
According to you however, appearances can bear analysis.
Now we are having a problem with your use of the word “analysis.” You are failing to make a distinction between ultimate analysis and conventional analysis. Appearances can bear conventional analysis even though appearances cannot bear ultimate analysis.

Malcolm wrote:
Madhyamakas never engage in conventional analysis. What would be the point? The point of Madhyamaka is not to reinforce conventional appearances which are by definition objects of false cognitions. The point of Madhyamaka is solely to point of the defective ultimate analysis of others.

Kenneth Chan said:
For example, a snake is an appearance to nonanalytical mind;
This is referring to a mind that does not use both conventional and ultimate analysis, and not just ultimate analysis.

Malcolm wrote:
This is referring to a nonanalytical mind.


Kenneth Chan said:
the rope is an appearance to a mind that has embarked upon analysis,
This refers to conventional analysis.

Malcolm wrote:
No, this refers to a mind that has not completed an ultimate analysis. For example, analyzing water into its intrinsic characteristics, or the perception of the shards left over when a vase is smashed with hammer, in Vasubandhu analysis of the two truths.


Kenneth Chan said:
but if we stop analyzing there, the rope remains a false appearance, because it is composed of parts, etc. When subjected to an ultimate analysis, no rope is found when sought.
Now, suddenly, you revert back to ultimate analysis only.

No, here the ultimate analysis is continued to its final conclusion.

Tsongkhapafan said:
It is a conceptual image. The empty space that your car occupied has no meaning from it's own side; your eye consciousness just sees a vacuity. You conceptually impute 'no car' on this space so now you have a generic image of no car, not just an empty space.

This emptiness has meaning - the object of negation is car, and what is realised conceptually is 'no car'. Your mind is resting in the generic image of an absence of car.

Malcolm wrote:
The problem here is the notion of "the generic image of emptiness." Emptiness cannot have a generic image since emptiness is not a thing, like a vase and its blueness. Meditating on the concept, "this is empty" is also unworkable. Of course, when we are learning about emptiness, of course we have to come to confidence in emptiness rationally, through reasonings. But when it comes to applying confidence in meditation, it is the position of the Sakya and Nyingma schools that focusing on a concept of emptiness is not a correct vipaśyāna, and in fact can lead to rebirth in the formless realms.

Correct vipaśyāna meditation on emptiness is resting the mind in an objectless equipoise discovered through exhausting all possible conceptual proliferation concerning entities in terms of all modes of their existence, as Śantideva notes. It is not resting the mind on the concept that results from conceptual analysis, rather, the mind that deconstructs even the notion., "this is ultimate" and rests in that state, free of proliferation.

For example, consider yourself right now in comparison to when you were a young child. Physically the body replaces it's material after every so many years, and mental phenomena only arise for very short spans of time, so there isn't any underlying 'packet' that makes the child-you and the current-you the same person. And yet at the same time, there is continuity between the two, so we can designate it as the same person.

The only difference between this little thought experiment and how rebirth works is that in rebirth, you get a different physical body. But because the body clearly isn't a self or person, that doesn't really change anything. The continuum of mental states between one rebirth and the next is there, and that's what makes it possible to designate them as the same person, just as the continuum of you and you as a child allows you to be considered the same person.

rachmiel said:
It's a vivid analogy ... but does it hold? The body-brain is the material medium in which the energy of self arises. Isn't it a leap of faith (in Buddha, the teachings, your own intuition) to believe that this energy continues when the material is no more?

Malcolm wrote:
One cannot abandon concepts through conceptuality. It simply isn't possible. One can exhaust conceptuality through examining all possible modes of the exustence of a given thing, but the Buddha says nowhere that one should meditate on a conceptual view of emptiness.

Right.  Which is to say that while someone (anyone) who applies the correct effort after having received the right teachings can become realized and may share "pure vision" teachings with the world, BUT only those with the correct past life connection to Guru Rinpoche can reveal terma now.

This takes us back to a discussion we were having in which the distinction between mind terma and pure vision was disregarded, which was unfortunate.  Here:

This  problem also plagues Dzogchen Community. ChNN has said over and over again he is not a terton. People keep insisting however that the Longsal teachings are termas. But they are not. They are dream teachings. ChNN never had an treasure index and so on. And it is not like he receives these teachings while he is awake ( I suppose he could, but it never appears that way in the texts of his teachings. They are always received in dreams). Of course, if one accepts he is the tulku of Adzom Drugpa, one could argue that this manner of receiving teachings is easier for doubtful westerners to swallow than the trope of pulling caches out of caves guarded by nāgās.

There is no need to reconcile them. Relative truth is an appearance to a nonanalytical mind. Ultimate truth is found upon analysis of those appearances. Why? Because as Candra points out, all things bear two natures, one relative (pre-analytical) and one ultimate (post-analytical). This is why, until Buddhahood, there is an equipoise (ultimate truth) and post-equipoise (relative truth) phase of insight meditation. In buddhahood, the mind is completely integrated with ultimate truth, and there is no division into equipoise and post-equipoise. The buddhas have no false cognitions at all.

Malcolm wrote:
That has never been under question. Other things about Tsongkhapa's presentation, such as asserting that only inherent existence is to be negated, are much more problematical.

Tsongkhapafan said:
Certainly not. By negating inherent existence only, this allows harmony with conventional truth because existence per se is not being negated - that's nihilistic. That's saying that the objects perceived by worldly people are not valid and do not exist because they are ONLY hallucinations of ignorance. Yet they perform reliably, which is quite different to the water of a mirage which is definitely wholly a hallucination.

You have no way to explain this reliability if you negate existence in its entirety - you are throwing the baby out with the bathwater by negating that mere appearances exist and function in accordance with karma. For you there is no difference between a horse and a unicorn so your conceptions about conventional truths are inadequate. It seems you are denying relative truths.

Malcolm wrote:
When you negate existence, it is not so much a negation as a not finding. When analyzed, things are not found to exist, not exist, both and neither, both in the relative and the ultimate. We don't negate existence, but when sought, it is not found. In other words, there is an appearance, when it is examined, its existence cannot be found in its parts, in one part, or separate from its parts, etc. In other words, we accept appearances as they are prior to analysis, since a relative truth is an appearance to a nonanalytical mind. When appearances are analyzed however, they cannot withstand analysis. According to you however, appearances can bear analysis. For example, a snake is an appearance to nonanalytical mind; the rope is an appearance to a mind that has embarked upon analysis, but if we stop analyzing there, the rope remains a false appearance, because it is composed of parts, etc. When subjected to an ultimate analysis, no rope is found when sought.

Negating inherent existence is not nihilistic because inherent existence has never existed.

When you realise there is no inherently existent I and there never has been, all fears and suffering disappear because these hallucinations were based on the experience of a false self.

The fourfold negation has no generic image, that is the point. The fourfold negation stills all false concepts possible about the relative and the ultimate leaving the mind in a state of freedom from proliferation. Śantideva says in Chapter 9:
When neither entities nor nonentities are present before the mind,

This latter point is what your paper fails to prove.

I also do not see it as a problem. Why should it be. All conventional presentations of reality, no matter how subtle or embracing, are bound to be incomplete, because no one but a Buddha has the omniscience to understand everything in its essence and in all its diversity.

I think the issue here is that you have failed to see the brilliance of what Lama Tsongkhapa has done. He has simply essentialized the critique. Refuting the first extreme, inherent existence sorts the issue, the rest is just clean-up. It's celan up that may need to happen, and of course we study it.

Malcolm wrote:
But it really does not.

The reason why Nāgārjuna refutes four extremes is that Jains, for example, maintain that things both exist and do not exist simultaneously, thus the refutation of the third extreme is needed, or the speculation that in the phase of arising, an entity may be said to both exist and not exist, as in the opinion of some Abidharmikas. Nonexistence is refuted because the Carvakas hold that a self which exists now is later annihilated, and existence is refuted in order to eliminate the belief that existents are veridical and nondeceptive, etc.

Production from self is refuted because this is what the Saṃkhya school holds, production from other is what the Vaiśeṣika school holds, and production without causes is what the Carvakas hold, and so on.

Each and every one of Nāgārjuna's refutations has as specific opponent in mind, and it is sloppy to think that one can simply clean them them with a pen because one imagines they are unnecessary double negatives.

Thus when the Buddha or Nāgārjuna says, "Not existent, not nonexistent, not both existent and nonexistent, and not neither existent and nonexistent" he has a specific opponent or class of assertions in mind which he is negating, one by one. Since these points of view are very possible in the mind and can be and are held, it is necessary to go through each one, step by step, in order to eliminate the faulty conceptualization which produces them in one's own mind.

Negating inherent existence only addresses the first extreme, but not the rest. That is the point.

Despite his strong arguments, I’m not inclined to renounce the wisdom of the lineage that has taught me about inherent existence. I need to understand what he is saying, and learn what the Gelugs say, then decide for myself. I think that is what Buddha taught. (And, yes, even though I am no academic scholar like many on DW, my method is still largely intellectual. It’s my karma now, and by following through, I hope to generate a more practice- and faith-based karma for the future.)

The disagreement 1) is over the issue of the intellectual history of Madhyamaka in India, and 2) over novelties in Tsongkhapa's own interpretation which seem unwarranted when Indian Madhyamaka is examined.

Finally, the purpose of these conversations is to eliminate concepts which lead us deeper into the cave, for everyone involved, including myself.

Finally, the reason why this conversation comes up again and again is because of the historical accident that the political dominance of the Ganden Phodrang propelled the teachings of Tsongkhapa to prominence and thus, they were the first version of Tibetan Madhyamaka to which early Western Buddhist scholars had access. This has skewed Madhyamaka studies in the West almost from the beginning.

It is necessary to redress this imbalance.

It is quite clear what you are saying. The problem is quite simply that you have an axe to grind with other physicists, and are using Madhyamaka incorrectly in order to bolster your claims about the lack of accounting for consciousness as a factor in observations of quantum phenomena. The problem with your whole theory is that Madhyamaka does not make any statements about consciousness per se. In Buddhadharma, theories about consciousness belong to Abhidharma and Yogacāra. At best, Madhyamakas are like Supreme Court justices, who are only interested in resolving ultimate truth claims.

You have claimed, over and over again that quantum physics is plagued by problems of inherency. It is true that physicalists regard the material world as real in the strong sense, in varying degrees. But their notion of the real does not necessitate that things are permanent, constant, unchanging, and independent— the ancient sense of "the real" that Madhyamaka critiques.

Instead the modern sense of the real is "the matter of fact." So for some physicists, the big bang is a matter of fact, i.e., real, until it is proven otherwise. In other words, the notion of the real in modern science is pragmatic, ala Charles Pierce, who echoes quite well the notion of conventional truth in Madhyamaka, "The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed upon by all who investigate is what we mean by the truth, and the object represented in this opinion is the real."

I don't see how substance dualism survives even conventionally. When you hear a science vs faith argument, the scientist is always eager to contrast monistic materialism with dualism because dualism collapses under its own paradox: that if things are separate, how do they interact, and if they interact, how are they separate? The poverty of dualism makes it an ideal punching bag for materialists.

In addition, things are never established even conventionally, so what is the basis for erecting different substances? There is none. And Vasubandhu made a lot with breaking down the atomistic dharmas of the old Buddhist schools. Plenty of modern Madhyamaka teachers use his analysis to refute particles, and QM upholds that refutation scientifically.

Also, one thing QM shows us is that binary options are not the only options. It is not that X is either a particle or a wave, but it manifests as both. X is something else entirely. So I don't agree that if we reject substance dualism we are left with Yogacara or materialism even conventionally, which is kind of the point of the paper. There may be a higher, simpler level in which matter and mind are united the way waves and particles are. Or they may be an explanation we simply don't know about.

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddhist perspective is that matter arises from consciousness, in fact. This is clearly stated by Vasubandhu in the Kośa.

Also, I did not say this, "Yogacara or materialism." My point was that Kenneth original proclaimed that solution to QM was to overthrown substance dualism. He then retreated on this point when I pointed out to him that there really are only two choices if we choose substance monism: everything is either a mental event or a physical event.

First of all, the charge that the Copenhagen interpretation rejects causality is not mine.

Second, dependent origination is strictly deterministic, "where this exists, that exists; from the arising of that, this arises."

... with respect to causality, Buddha is a determinist.

Kenneth Chan said:
This argument concerning the fact that quantum mechanics is not deterministic is extremely important and needs to be carefully addressed. Malcolm, it may surprise you to know that your argument, concerning how the indeteministic nature of quantum mechanics contrasts with the deterministic nature of causality in Buddhism, actually supports the argument that the application of Madhyamika philosophy solves the mystery of quantum mechanics. Let me elaborate.

The lack of determinism in quantum mechanics is a lack of determinism when only the materialistic factors are taken into account. It means that given all the information concerning materialistic things that it is possible to have, we cannot predict the exact behaviour of particles in the future.

Quantum mechanics can only take into account the materialistic information that experimental science can provide. Currently there is no scientific equipment that can detect or measure consciousness directly. And no such equipment means no actual data on mind and consciousness per se. And that, in turn, means that quantum mechanics does not take into account factors pertaining directly to the mind and consciousness.

Malcolm wrote:
So now you are a substance dualist? And further, your proof depends on something (mind) that cannot be measured.


Kenneth Chan said:
So when we say that quantum mechanics is not deterministic, we actually mean that, given all the information on only materialistic things, we cannot predict the future behaviour of materialistic particles. This is not a problem for Buddhism. In fact, the reverse would be a problem. If, in fact, quantum mechanics is deterministic, there would then be no room for karma, motivation, mental factors, and so on, to have a role to play.

Malcolm wrote:
So you now are retreating from your position regarding the nonduality of mind and matter and are proposing instead substance dualism?


Kenneth Chan said:
If quantum mechanics is fully deterministic while being based only on materialistic considerations, we would be back to the classical idea of a clockwork universe, where mind and consciousness are totally insignificant and are to be considered only as “side-effects.”

So the fact that quantum mechanics is not deterministic actually supports the understanding that Madhyamika philosophy can actually explain the mystery of quantum physics. Also, the fact that the mind plays an important role in quantum mechanics actually suggests that the indeterminant nature of quantum physics may actually be due to the fact that quantum mechanics does not take into account factors pertaining to the mind itself.

Malcolm wrote:
That would depend on nama (mind) and rūpa (matter) being distinct substances (dravya), i.e., substance dualism.

Kenneth Chan said:
There is also no reason why Madhyamika philosophy cannot be applied to solving the problem of quantum mechanics, regardless of whether or not the Madhyamaka masters actually focused on these kinds of issues. Also, I see no reason why I have to prove that the interpretation according to the Madhyamaka view must necessarily be incompatible with the Yogachara position. That’s not really relevant.

Malcolm wrote:
I merely point out that everything you say can equally be explained from a half-eggist Yogacāra position, since they do not refute external objects.

Kenneth Chan said:
As far as I can see, the only thing that remains unresolved is the question of whether Lama Tsongkhapa’s interpretation of Madhyamika philosophy represents the ultimate truth. That point cannot be resolved on the basis of the findings of quantum mechanics. Regardless of that, it still remains true that the findings of quantum mechanics provide strong scientific evidence that Lama Tsongkhapa’s view that all things are empty of inherent existence because they are dependently originated is, in fact, correct.

Malcolm wrote:
We already know things are empty of inherent existence because the teaching dependent origination negates prime movers, i.e. unconditioned first causes. The point Nāgārjuna was making was that any explanation of dependent origination which involved inherency theories is incoherent (we don't need to bring Tsongkhapa into this since the idea that a given thing that is dependently originated lacks inherent existence is not Tsongkhapa's idea to begin with).

This already renders the speculations of physicists about the big bang and so on a priori invalid from a Buddhist point of view because they do not correspond to relative truth, rendering the world static and functionless. Of course, at this point, physicists are beginning to understand that the universe has no actual beginning, it is also based on causes. But they have no math to describe the cyclic universe of ancient Indian cosmology since their observations necessarily end at conventional beginning of this one.

So, the point is not that quantum mechanics validates the Buddha's insight into dependent origination, the point is that unconditioned entities beget nothing; only conditioned entities beget conditioned entities. The real problem at the heart of modern physics is the Aristotelian notion of prime movers which is deeply embedded in our concepts of God and the origin of the universe. In my view, physicists import such ideas into their modeling unconsciously, or quite consciously in the case of the Templeton Foundation and the intelligent design folks.

However I am quite sure, since dependent origination is the correct interpretation of conventional truth, that as science progresses, its view of reality will more closely match the ancient philosophical intuitions of the Buddha— on this much we can agree.

Kenneth Chan said:
I note that you complain that I keep making this statement. It is, however, an important statement, and is, in fact, the crux of the matter. So if you disagree with it, you have to refute it. However, up till now, I see no indication that you are able to do so. So the statement stands.

I do not see how quantum mechanics is reaffirming the basic insight that there is no inherent existence.

For example, in the half-eggist theory, physical phenomena exist, but how they exist for us is determined by our perception of them, much like your collapse of the wave function.

Kenneth Chan said:
There is no “overwhelming emphasis on the role of the observer” in my paper. I have already said, many times, that Madhyamika philosophy avoids the extreme position of solipsism. So it is not at all like the Yogacara argument.

Malcolm wrote:
It is a total mischaracterization to state that any school of Yogacāra is in anyway solipsistic.


Kenneth Chan said:
There is no solipsism because it is the interaction of the mind and the “causes and conditions” of the external world that constitutes our primary reality (although even this is empty of inherent existence). This interaction (which I call an experiential event ) involves both the mind and the “external world” in equal measure.

Malcolm wrote:
As in half-eggist Yogacāra.

Kenneth Chan said:
The quantum wave function, in quantum mechanics, would correspond to the “causes and conditions” of the “external world,” and the eigenstates and their corresponding eigenvalues would correspond to the experiential events that manifest upon the act of observation by the mind. So both mind and “external world” have the same ontological status.

Malcolm wrote:
As in half-eggist Yogacāra.

Kenneth Chan said:
The quantum wave function is not something that only occurs in the mind; it is present in the "external world" although it is empty of inherent existence because what the quantum wave function does is merely to provide a probability distribution of possible measurement results if and only if there is an actual act of measurement by the observer. So, because the very meaning of the quantum wave function depends on the mind of the observer, it is empty of inherent existence. Nonetheless, it is definitely not totally nonexistent. The presence of the quantum wave function in the "external world" means that we do not have a case of solipsism.

Malcolm wrote:
Madhyamaka cannot be applied as solution to this problem because Madhyamaka merely provides a rule set for falsifying ultimate truth claims. It does not set out any ultimate truth claims of its own.

Kenneth Chan said:

The problem of having to fit quantum mechanics into the framework of an inherently existing mind-matter dualism led physicists to the extremes of either solipsism or materialism.

Malcolm wrote:
Or course it is. You yourself have admitted it to be so. However, there is one problem here. You have never defined what for you materialism means. As I understand it, materialism— by which I understand you to mean physicalism— is the claim that a "mind" is merely a convention for physical events which occur in a brain which give us the illusion of of self, and so on.

Kenneth Chan said:

Malcolm, how many times do I have to say this? We are dealing with the problem physicists have in interpreting quantum mechanics, and physicists are generally not interested in philosophy per se. I know physicists; most of them, in fact, claim that philosophy is "a lot of hot air"! So if you ask them about Hume or Dennett, they will probably tell you that they are not interested in what they say. So whether or not Hume has addressed the problem of inherency is irrelevant here. Physicists, in general, insist on materialism and that is the problem.

Malcolm wrote:
I think the problem here is that you are not defining your terms well. Physicist in general tend to be physicalists, that is, they reject the idea that there is some kind of mind which exists separate from materials processes, if they even accept that mind exists at all. Hence they tend to be substance monists. You keep claiming they are dualists, in general, and I do not see how you can make this generalization. Your claim is something like the "all true scotsman" fallacy.

However, whether or not all physicists, some physicists or none of them are substance dualists or physicalists, this has no bearing at all on whether or not they agree in principle that observation affects the outcomes of experiments in quantum mechanics. Einstein rejected this idea, but his rejection of this, his insistence that there had to be an actual physical event which correlates to an observation, has been dismissed for 80 years.

There is no connection between meat that I buy, and the suffering of said animal. It already happened and is finished, for that life.

Karma is volition, and the secondary acts of body and voice that proceed from that. In order for killing to be part of my karma, I must request some being be killed or do it myself. Otherwise, there is no karma involved.

The minute that I point out that Madhyamaka does not reject the classical substance dualism which pervades Sūtrayāna Buddhism, you then deflect.

Madhyamakas do not spend time erecting theories about conventions. A conventional truth is something which is functional, designated on the basis of relative appearance to healthy sense organs. The minute something which was previously thought functional is shown to be conventionally false, Madhyamakas also reject that. As long as everyone accepts it is true, Madhyamakas will waste no time tilting windmills. for example, if physicalism proves to be true, Mādhyamikas would be bound to accept it, since it would be conventionally established. And as there are no ultimate phenomena, there would no refuge for Madhyamakas there.

When you collapse mind/matter dualism, you have two choices, all events are mental events (Yogacāra) or all events are physical events (Dennet, etc.). This still does not prevent the observation of phenomena.

Unicorns are imputations. Horse are imputations. Now you have to define the difference between a false one and a true one. And that is where you start making ontological assertions. A true imputation involves a correspondence theory between what you perceive and what is out there. Now, we already know that a correspondence theory is invoked by Candrakīrti on the basis of the distinction between two modes of false cognitions: 1) false cognitions about natures 2) false cognitions about common appearances, i.e., seeing one moon as opposed to two.

However, this does not bear up to analysis either since in the experience of a yogi, he or she may see a given space as the pure land of Avalokiteśvara, Potala, where we all see a midden heap filled with trash. In this case then, is the experiential appearances of a yogi deluded, like the drunk's perception of two moons? A madmen too may see his region as the Potala buddhafield. A madman too may believe he is Avalokiteśvara.

Can't you make a distinction though based on the mind of the perceiver though? A Yogi has a valid yogic direct perception, whereas the madman has impaired faculties.

In any case, I'm not surprised that you can easily get into trouble when you start looking at these issues in pramana. It's like the old chicken and egg problem with perception relying on inference and inference relying on perception. Under analysis, pramana falls apart just like everything else, so if you are trying to work things out conventionally, you have to accept that pramana is able to function and remember to steer clear of the issues that lead you to analyze too deeply.

The point is that in the Gelug persentation, conventional truth is put forth from the perspective of Sautrantikas following reason, which is essentially a pramana based perspective. Why do you think other schools give Gelugpas such a hard time. No only are the contradictions in Tsongkhapa's teachings with respect to what Nāgārjuna fathers and sons have said, but there are problems with his resorting to the conventional truth perspective of pramana.

i just posted this in what could hijack another thread , i think it is appropriate here for this is where i got sparked to think about  what i just deleted.



Malcolm and others, i am not a Dzogchen initiate, but am fascinated with it.
I once asked a Rinpoche,in a group setting, who i was practicing under diligently.
I asked what are the chances of a  Tantra practioner who is a householder ,attain enlightenment in this life.
He said out right. "very slim to none."
What about Dzogchen, which I am thinking about embarking on.
Also 10 years ago I wanted to embark on this path but it was like you really needed to be close for awhile to a Guru / Teacher before recieving the empowerments.
In other words , really be close to one.

Now it seems that it's easy to find someone , even online in a webcast to receive this empowerment.

Back in the day only a select few monks could receive any sort of empowerment , then it became like me....walk in off the street and for a few bucks  you too can be Vajrayogini .

really hope this received well and in the light of just what the words say with no agenda here..
i need honesty and compassion to comfort a part of my being at this juncture.

It is rare anyone achieves Buddhahood in this lifetime. It is very common however for Vajrayāna practitioners to attain buddhahood at the point of death, or even in the bardo. It is even more common for Dzogchen practitioners to achieve buddhahood at the time of the death or in the bardo, and in the case of Dzogchen practitioners, provided they understand the teachings and practice in a precise way, it is certain they will never return to samsara again.

Unicorns are imputations. Horse are imputations. Now you have to define the difference between a false one and a true one. And that is where you start making ontological assertions. A true imputation involves a correspondence theory between what you perceive and what is out there. Now, we already know that a correspondence theory is invoked by Candrakīrti on the basis of the distinction between two modes of false cognitions: 1) false cognitions about natures 2) false cognitions about common appearances, i.e., seeing one moon as opposed to two.

However, this does not bear up to analysis either since in the experience of a yogi, he or she may see a given space as the pure land of Avalokiteśvara, Potala, where we all see a midden heap filled with trash. In this case then, is the experiential appearances of a yogi deluded, like the drunk's perception of two moons? A madmen too may see his region as the Potala buddhafield. A madman too may believe he is Avalokiteśvara.

Bakmoon said:
I guess my main summary of the whole issue is that everyone (both Gelug and non-Gelug Madhyamikas) agree that mere appearances are not refuted, but the Gelug tradition puts qualifiers into all the negations to make this clear up-front, and non-Gelug Madhyamikas generally leave the qualifiers out and don't feel the need to make all of the technical terms fit together into a detailed and comprehensive philosophical system.

Malcolm wrote:
Appearances are the object of analysis, but they are not the object of negation. For example, when we have a moon in the water, we do not say, that moon in the water does not exist. We do however subject it to analysis to understand that it is not the real moon. Also the appearance of the moon in the sky is an object of analysis. However, since conventional appearances are not able to bear ultimate analysis, any concept regarding their existence or nonexistence has to be abandoned. It is the only way the creation stage works. For example, the third Docupchen asks Gelugpas, "If for you appearances are conventionally established in the perception of ordinary people, does this not render the creation stage a mere imputation and a false appearance?"

In reality, when practicing Vajrayāna, Gelugpas use a species of Yogacara Madhyamaka just like everyone else.

In the thread concerning Kenneth Chan's essay on https://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f=102&t=24265#p367191, there was a familiar sub-topic critiquing Tsongkhapa’s use of “inherent existence”. The sub-topic started around https://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f=102&t=24265&start=80#p367976, and reached a pinnacle for me https://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f=102&t=24265&start=160#p368353, with my summation and the replies from Malcolm and Bakmoon that followed, concluding with this from Bakmoon: Thank you both, Malcolm and Bakmoon! These direct responses are particularly good grist for my still churning mill. I'm struggling to formulate a coherent question about all this to put to a couple of my teachers.


Bakmoon said:
Would you like to talk over some of these issues in a new thread? I know from experience that these subtle issues are really opaque if you haven't studied the subject fairly closely already, so I can definitely sympathize with the confusion.

Jeff H said:
I’d like to take Bakmoon up on his suggestion of a thread to explore the critique of Tsongkhapa. I’m putting this in the Gelug forum because my purpose is to compose a question for my Gelug teachers, and I’d like some assistance.

On DW it seems like a foregone conclusion that Tsongkhapa’s teachings on the topic of inherency as the object of negation have been overturned. Tsongkhapafan always takes up the banner, but it appears that most of the rest of us who follow Gelug teachings aren’t really up to entering the debate.

How should I present this question to my teacher? Here’s my starting place:

“Some say Tsongkhapa’s qualification of ‘inherent existence’ is unnecessary. Worse than unnecessary, as one person put it, ‘The main criticism of Tsongkhapa's view is that it supposes that a nonexistence (the absence of inherent existence) is ultimate. This makes Tsongkhapa's point of view subtly nihilistic.’ 

“They point to references from Nagarjuna and Chandrakirti that indicate the object of negation is simply existence and, by extension, non-existence. They say there’s no reason to belabor conventional appearance as an instance of what might be called ‘false existence’, and that to do so leaves an impression of true existence in the student’s mind.

“I revere the Tsongkhapa-based teachings I have received, but I do not know how to respond to these criticisms.”

Malcolm wrote:
The actual problem is that the Gelug view promotes relative realism (not nonexistent in the relative) and ultimate nihilism (not existent in the ultimate).

Your teachers will probably tell you to stop listening to Sakyapas and Nyingmapas. But the truth is that the Gelugpas have never amounted an effective rebuttal to Gorampa or Mipham. The scholar who has the most balanced view about all of this in the modern epoch is HHDL. He is committed to Tsongkhapa's view, but has the largeness of heart to try and understand the critiques against Tsongkhapa's view and to try and see where there is commonality among them.

The normal trope is that Tsongkhapa explains the view from the perspective of an ordinary person; the Sakyapas explain the view from the perspective of the path; and the Nyingmapas explain the view from the perspective of the result. It is a gross generalization, but there is some truth in it.

in that case, this is the basis of the meditation that generates awakened mind. 
After the three samadhis are stable, and after binding three symbolic mudras,

Mipham, summarizing Mañjuśrīmitra's autocommentary, adds:
If it is asked, “What is the method of realizing the definitive meaning through the indirect method?,” since nonactivity is illustrated with the activity of fabricated efforts, like pointing to the moon with the finger, also awakened mind correctly grasped through a symbol will accomplish awakening, because the Bhagavan Buddha, the teacher of devas and humans, has declared that it is “great awakening.” Any unfortunate one who conceptualizes entities should make efforts in the indirect method of realization.

This is similar to what Dudjom Lingpa says in Vajra Essence 182-184

"For the direct identification within your own being, you first establish all phenomenon included in samsara and nirvana as emptiness. Once you have ascertained them as the displays of the space of ultimate reality, you identify this state as the great revelation and apprehend your own natute. As a result, you naturally settle in ground pristine awareness as the great freedom from extremes. This is the swift path, the yana of the great perfection.

In reliance upon the relative, effortful path--as a means for leading beings to ultimate, effortless absolute space-- the kayas and facests of primordial consciousness of the ground sugatagarbha are generated as signs. And many sadhanas involving visualisations and recitations are taught in accordance with the many accounts of the names and meanings of deities to be revealed, buddhafields, palaces, teachers and retinues
All accounts assering that by striving in meditative practice you will reach some vast region somewhere else, called a buddhafield, are called paths of expedient means."

Because the Copenhagen interpretation is the dominate interpretation, and it explicitly rejects causality, contra Einstein, etc.

Anders said:
That is too simplistic, and only considers Bohr.

The Copenhagen interpretation rejects determinism. Not causality per se. As can be seen from this quote from Bohr:

"In physics, causal description, originally adapted to the problems of mechanics, rests on the assumption that the knowledge of the state of a material system at a given time permits the prediction of its state at any subsequent time."

Moreover, as a strict instrumentalist, Bohr did not reject causality as a physical law (of which he was noncommittal), but as a useful mode of description and measurement concerning certain properties at the quantum level, of which he claimed their causal (deterministic) properties could not be known at the quantum level.

Heisenberg, in contrast, did not equate causality with determinism and understood quantum physics to be very much causal, albeit probabilistic causality.

Kenneth Chan said:
The Copenhagen interpretation is one of the interpretations I discussed in detail in my paper. And Anders is absolutely correct. It does not reject causality. What the Copenhagen interpretation actually rejects is determinism, not causality.

The Copenhagen interpretation, and, in fact, quantum mechanics in general, is not deterministic because we cannot determine the exact future behaviour of a particle, even if we have all the information it is possible to have concerning a particle. This is because the quantum wave function of the particle only provides us with a probability distribution of possible measurement results if and only if we make a measurement. With only knowledge of a probability distribution of possible measurement results, it means that we cannot predict the exact result of a future measurement on a particle.

But that hardly means that it rejects causality. There is still cause and effect, only the exact effect cannot be predicted beforehand from the information we can have about a physical particle. Einstein’s unhappiness about this probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics was what prompted him to declare: “God does not play dice.”

There is, nonetheless, still cause and effect. The clearest example of this in quantum mechanics would be that it is the act of measurement by an observer that causes the collapse of the wave function ... only we cannot predict beforehand exactly how the quantum wave function would collapse. That surely does not mean that there is no cause and effect.

In fact, it is exactly this cause and effect that constitutes the process of dependent origination. In the collapse of the wave function, the physical particle, in Heisenberg’s words, makes the transition from the “possible” to the “actual” and manifests as a particle, in dependence upon the mind of the observer that apprehends it. And since the particle is only dependently originated, it is empty of inherent existence.

How then does this not provide scientific evidence for Lama Tsongkhapa’s view that all things are empty of inherent existence because they are dependently originated?

Malcolm wrote:
First of all, the charge that the Copenhagen interpretation rejects causality is not mine.

Second, dependent origination is strictly deterministic, "where this exists, that exists; from the arising of that, this arises."

Further, I do not see how quantum mechanics is reaffirming the basic insight that there is no inherent existence. For example, to take your line of thinking, one can make a argument that (half-eggist) Yogacara is affirmed by quantum mechanics because of the overwhelming emphasis in your theory on the role of the observer. For example, in the half-eggist theory, physical phenomena exist, but how they exist for us is determined by our perception of them, much like your collapse of the wave function.

But in fact, with respect to causality, Buddha is a determinist.

I am sure you are more familiar than I with the intellectual history of quantum mechanics, but how, for example, can you show that causality is necessary, when quantum mechanics theory for the last century 80 years has in general rejected it?

In order to show that quantum mechanics confirms dependent origination, you would have to show that quantum mechanics confirms causality.

The Buddha's proposition is a simple one, all conditioned entities arise from a cause, and all causes are themselves effects.

This is entirely separate from the notion of the presence or absence of inherent existence, introduced into Buddhism in order to explain causality by ṥrāvakas later on.

There is a recent book http://www.wisdompubs.org/book/authorized-lives which explores this. It is very interesting and worthwhile reading.

There is no term in Sanskrit niḥniḥsvabhāva. This is only svabhāva and niḥsvabhāva, inherent existence and the absence of inherent existence.

It is an argument which mainly concerns 1) pedagogy 2) Tsongkhapa's novel attempt to create a system out of what he called "Prasangika" which would be largely unrecognizable to any Indian Madhyamaka scholar. A great deal of the debate turns on how definitive Nāgārjunas own writings are. For those who consider Nāgārjuna definitive and straightfoward, many Gelug attempts at subtly and nuance seem off-base. Gelugs respond that Nāgārjuna needs interpretation, which is tantamount to saying that Nāgārjuna's own writings are not definitive.

Tsongkhapa is saying that what we experience is a relative existence in the minds of people like me.

When NIda started teaching Mantra Healing though Shang Shung Institute (SSI), Norbu RInpoche felt this was outside the scope of SSI's mission, and so Nida, after fulfilling his obligations to SSI, parted with SSI and struck out on his own. It was not a sudden thing, but a gradual disengagement. Nida's departure seems to have been precipitated by a Sache project Nida had initiated at Mergigar in 2003. Nida, at some cost, had five boulders placed in a meadow (below the Yellow House) at Merigar and painted the colors of the five elements. Norbu Rinpoche really did not like this at all  and immediately had some Dzogchen community people who had helped Nida paint the boulders scrub the paint off with wire brushes. FYI, I was there at the time and witnessed everything first hand. After this point, Nida and SSI began to slowly disengage.

So I think it is fair to say that there was some substantive disagreements over the direction Nida was taking at SSI, and so in order to be more free to follow his own dictates, Nida moved on, since he was not a student of Norbu Rinpoche. I would not characterize this as a falling out, but rather, a parting of ways after a largely successful collaboration seemed to have run its course. The Italian SSI still teaches Kunye in Nida's style, rather than Dr. Phunstok Wangmo's style. Actually, I think it is good Nida moved on. Diversity is good in education, and hopefully Nida's various projects with respect to Tibetan Medicine will bear fruit.

Malcom,

Can you recommend this book as a starting point for those who have received transmission yet are new to Dzogchen teachings and have not read any other material?

If not can you recommend a starting point so one can work towards this material?

Thanks!

There are parts in this book suited to beginners, specifically topic 8, in the sections on semzins and rushan. The first seven topics mainly cover theory and yogic anatomy. Of course the latter is very important, and one should understand them well.

Otherwise, get the Precious Vase and work through it. Or get both.

Yes it makes perfect sense and it is the expression of a view. Through the negation of inherent existence we come to realise that things are dependently-arisen appearances and on this level, they exist. This is an assertion and therefore a view. The Madhyamaka is therefore not 'no view' or merely the negation of others' views.

That really isn't what I'm saying. Emptiness is the mere absence of all the things we normally see. That's a view but that mere absence is not a 'thing'. This  is the mistake that Nagarjuna is referring to, the reifying of emptiness, feeling that it is a separate reality existing behind conventional appearances when it is actually the real nature of those appearances.

Again, Nagarjuna's words require interpretation. 'renunciation of views' means 'renunciation of views of inherent existence' not renunciation of views per se - that's going too far.

Malcolm wrote:
You, my friend, have a view of emptiness, precisely as Nāgārjuna described it, " the reifying of emptiness, feeling that it is a separate reality existing behind conventional appearances when it is actually the real nature of those appearances."

You think, by making a distinction between separate reality on the one one hand and a real nature on the other that you are avoiding this problem, but it is not so. This exactly the mistake to which Nāgārjuna refers.

Emptiness is the recognition that the things we perceive are not real. It is not their absence. If you claim emptiness is the absence of things, you are reifying that absence, similar with the one who reifies the mistaken thought of a fairy castle. Thus you are dragged underwater by the crocodile of the view.

It is an affirmation of the key principle of Prasangika Madhyamaka: All things are empty of inherent existence because they are dependently arisen. This has to be how Chandrakirti, Shantideva and Lama Tsongkhapa interpreted the meaning of Nagarjuna to arrive at this conclusion. And it makes sense.

In his commentary to this line, Buddhapalita states:
For example, someone with a confused mind sees a fairy castle and the thought arises in his mind "fairy castle," but when he is free from that confusion and sees it as it truly is, there is no entity called "mistaken thought of a fairy castle" in the mistaken thought of a fairy castle and  he only then becomes free from a concept about a nonexistent. In the same way, when seeing how it truly is, that mistaken emptiness (which arises from the crocodile of the view [of emptiness as an] entity) is not [in fact] an entity called "emptiness." Apart from the mere expression, "emptiness,"  those that view emptiness as an entity have their eye of wisdom obscured by the darkness of ignorance and thus the great doctors, the victors, able to discern for whom a treatment will succeed or not, have said [the treatment] will not succeed [for them].
Thus emptiness is merely a therapy for wrong views, and cannot be construed as a view itself. To construe emptiness itself as a view is to render oneself incurable.

Nagarjuna's argument is very clear though. Fundamentally his argument is that there are two kinds of Bhava, namely Svabhava and Parabhava. Both Svabhava and Parabhava are refuted, and since there is no Bhava apart from these two, Bhava in general is refuted.

It just doesn't make sense to say that Bhava means something truly existent in this passage, because he is using the term Bhava in contradistinction with Svabhava. If Bhava means a truly existing thing as opposed to just an existing thing, then Nagarjuna's argument in this passage is illogical and fails, because Bhava ans Svabhava are synonyms, and Parabhava isn't a subset of Bhava.

Kenneth Chan said:
Well, if you look at the two translations of this passage that I quoted, you can see clearly that both translators do not agree with you on this. They are considering Bhava in the sense of true existence which can only be established if there is essence or nature.

Getting the correct meaning of any passage does not depend on sticking rigidly to the meaning of the literal translation of individual words. We have to look at the context to get the true meaning, and we must check that this meaning does not contradict other parts of the same text.

Malcolm wrote:
But you have not got at the meaning— Bakmoon's presentation is perfectly correct. Bhāva never means "true existence" in either Sanskrit nor in its translation into Tibetan as dngos po, where, in this case, it means "existence" ( dngos po also translates the term vastu, i.e. entity). I am afraid that you are going full Humpty-Dumpty on us, by asserting that words do not mean what they mean in the context from which they derive their meaning.

Again I think we are dealing with the context in which the word "inherent existence" is being used. It may be the same word, but in a different context, the meaning may be different.

I am not sure what you mean by "no preference for conventional truths." Both conventional truth and ultimate truth are important in Madhyamika philosophy. As Nagarjuna says:

The Buddha’s teaching of the Dharma
Is based on two truths:
A truth of worldly convention
And an ultimate truth.

Those who do not understand
The distinction between these two truths
Do not understand
The Buddha’s profound truth.

Without a foundation in the conventional truth,
The significance of the ultimate truth cannot be taught.
Without understanding the significance of the ultimate,
Liberation is not achieved.

Malcolm wrote:
If you wish to understand this properly you have to understand what a "truth" (satya) is. According to Candrakīrti, a truth is an object of a cognition. An ultimate truth is the object of a veridical or unmistaken cognition; a relative truth is the object of a mistaken cognition. Within relative truths there are two more subdivisions: conventional truths, which are functional phenomena; and false relative truths which can be defined as delusions, like the two moons seen in the sky by a drunk.

All discussions of emptiness then, belong to the realm of conventional truth because these discussions are effective in generating an understanding of ultimate truth, and when ultimate truth is understood (the enumerated ultimate), nirvana (the unenumerated ultimate) can be attained. That, for Nāgārjuna, is all he cares about with respect to conventional truth. Nāgārjuna is not interested in making relative truth prettier or more effective, he is solely interested in the realization of nirvana and how one achieves that. Apart from that, Nāgārjuna has no interest in conventional truths which have no bearing on liberation.

Therefore, all one needs to do to make sure quantum mechanics is consistent with Buddhadharma is to subject every claim made in quantum mechanics to a simple test. One does not even have to involve emptiness, absence of inherent existence, and any claim of conventional existence. What is that simple test? Does this claim violate the principle of dependent origination? If there is a proposition that something arises either from itself, from another, both, or in absence of a cause, that proposition automatically fails the dependent origination test and can be regarded as conventionally invalid from a Madhyamaka point of view. If a proposition does not assert arising from self, other, both or without a cause, that proposition passes the "Madhyamaka" test with regard to being a valid convention. Any other sort of proposition will fail the test and can be rejected.

For this reason, Madhyamaka does not advocate any specific kind of conventional presentation. It merely sets up a rule set for falsifying all propositions.

Kenneth Chan said:
I am certainly no expert in Sanskrit, but simply having a different term for "true existence" does not change the meaning of Bhava. For example, the presence of terms like "adult male" or "male person" does not mean that the word "man" has to mean something else. In any case, words can used in differing senses depending on the context. In the context of the verses by Nagarjuna, Bhava certainly suggests the meaning of "true existence."

Bakmoon said:
No one in the history of Madhyamaka has ever said that the word Bhava means true existence. Not even Lama Tsongkhapa ever said that. If you read the relevant portions of Lama Tsongkhapa's Great Treatise on the Stages of the Path where he argues for his distinctive presentation of Madhyamaka (in particular, Part III Chapter 17) he doesn't say that the terms Sutras and Shastras explicitly teach that the object of negation is only inherent existence, but rather his argument is that even though the texts very often refute existence (as opposed to inherent existene), these passages are not to be taken literally. Everyone agrees that the apparent meaning of the texts is a refutation of existence; the only issue is are these texts to be accepted without the need for further interpretation that goes beyond the plain meaning of the text.

Kenneth Chan said:
If we look at the word Bhava in isolation, we would translate it as "existent." But even the word "existent" can have different shades of meaning depending on the context in which the word is being used. That is why the same word of one language can be translated into different words of another language by different translators. This is because of context. We have to try to understand Nagarjuna by looking at the verses in their entirety and how the verses link to one another. Rigidly sticking to the meaning of the literal translation of a word in isolation is ignoring the fact that we need to consider the context.

Here are two different translations of Verse 4 of Chapter 15 of MMK:

Without having essence or otherness-essence,
How can there be entities?
If there are essences and entities
Entities are established.

Without self-nature and other-nature, whence can there be an existent? For, the existent is established only when there is self-nature or other-nature.

Although the word is translated as “entity” or “existent,” the meaning of this word has to be taken in context. Nagarjuna is saying that without essence or nature, the entity or existent cannot be established. The sense of the word entity or existent here surely suggests the meaning of an entity having true existence. It is in the context of the passage.

Malcolm wrote:
The passage means that all assertions of existence are incoherent because they all imply imply inherency. That is why Nāgarajuna says that whoever sees inherent existence, dependent or other-existence, existence or nonexistence has not seen the Buddha's teaching.

That which arises dependently is free from all of these designations. All of these designations— inherent existence, dependent existence, existence and nonexistence— do not apply to dependently originated phenomena. It is not simply that phenomena are empty solely of inherent existence, they are empty of all forms of existence. Their existence is just a convention, a designation, a mistaken imputation. There is nothing real behind those designations, just as, in the example Śantideva uses, there is no real woman behind the illusory women created by the magician.

This is also why Madhyamaka has no preference for conventional truths, per se. Why? Because all conventional truths depend on imputations of arising and ceasing, coming and going, permanence and annihilation, identity and difference. Dependent origination however is free of those eight, that is why it is called "profound."

In fact, the whole argument boils down to a debate over whether the coarse object of negation, existence, is sufficient, or whether one has to more sharply define the object of negation to inherent existence. All Madhyamakas including Candrakirti and Śantideva along with all Tibetans (outside of Gelug) accept the former point of view. Only Lama Tsongkhapa insists on the latter.

Even if we accept that the latter is the proper formulation of the object of negation, this still does not mean that Madhyamaka supports any given position about conventional truths, since conventional truths, according to Gelugs, are designations, and designations change over time and in cultures. For example, a conventional truth of ancient Tibet is Meru cosmology. It is not a conventional truth for us.

When there is another paradigm shift in physics that takes us beyond quantum mechanics in the same way quantum mechanics took us past the clockwork universe of Newton, then quantum mechanics will be deprecated too, and no longer valid outside of a very limited type of operation for which it is effective, like Euclidean geometry today. We can use Euclid, but it is limited in its scope.
