White Sakura said:
Is it correct to compare the different Tibetan languages to French, Italian and Spanish? I mean, are the Tibetan languages really so different to each other as the Romance languages are? So a person cannot just get used to another dialect? Must sit and lern it as another language?
If it is different languages then for every prayer text the first question is, what Tibetan that is? Or is there one Tibetan language spread in the western countries?
I never heard that there are different translators of different Tibetan needed in my country. So I thought, Tibetan is one language and all Lamas speak that, no matter which area of Tibet their ancestors come from. Are the monks all trained in one main Tibetan language?

Malcolm wrote:
The scriptural language is the same, but dialect and pronunciation require Tibetan translators between Amdo people and Central Tibetans. These days Tibetans from different parts of Tibet tend to use Chinese as their common language when interacting with other Tibetans who do not share their dialect.

I find a far greater variation in teachers than lineages. Two teachers in the same lineage can be very different based on my experience with various Nyingma teachers. Some teachers demand a very traditional approach, where you have only one teacher and they are very involved, and you start with traditional ngondro, three roots, etc. etc. Others are on the opposite end of the spectrum, many are in between.

Going from Gelug to Kagyu may give some cognitive dissonance based on how they incorporate Yogacara, especially if you end up with a Shentong-type teacher.

Co-emergent is a dumb word and is not proper English. It was coined by a German, of course.

SilenceMonkey said:
Lol, agreed.

I was always curious about this word. In terms of ignorance, what is it that ignorance arises with?

Malcolm wrote:
It means that in the first moment that the basis arises up from the basis, one does not know what these appearances are. Hence the term "connate ignorance" (lhan cig skyes ma rig pa).

Sahajajñāna on the other hand, lhan cig skyes pa'i ye shes, refers to the wisdom that one discovers by oneself, so it is a synonym of rang byung ye shes. It does not really mean "connate" at all, in this context.

It is a complicated term, connate for example can refer to the cause, the three afflictions, and so on. It cannot be defined in just one way, because there are many ways of understanding this term. For example, Jetsun Rinpoche, in his commentary on Hevajra, defines it as follows:

The Hevajra states:

Whatever arises connately
is called connate.
Called “connate by nature,”
all aspects are unified and one.

“If it is asked what entity is connate, that is called “connate by nature.” That being the case, there are two types of connate: example and meaning. If it is asked what is the meaning [connate], it means that ‘by nature’ has been so from the start, but is not produced dependently. If it is asked why that is the case, “All aspects are a single vow.” This means that when all phenomena are summarized, they are free from all proliferation.”

But Saraha defines it:

Connate gnosis 
is the reality that one experiences.

Aryadeva states:

Because the seed syllable A that is the door to all concentrations is nonarising, it is said to be the door to all phenomena, and is also called connate gnosis.

Thus as per usual, there is no one size fits all for this term. It all depends on context.

...I wanted to point out that the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta did not say:



Which suggests to me that "everything is is stressful (or suffering)" was not the intention of the teaching.

On the other hand, it did say:



Which points to a way out of suffering, as promised. In very simple words, we make ourselves unhappy by grabbing on to things which can't make us happy, and the way out is to stop grabbing.

To complete the argument, the sutta is not saying "life is suffering", i.e. our suffering is not built into the way the world is, but is a result of our poor choices.

We can't experience anything through our afflicted Skandhas that is somehow removed from dukkha, dukkha is omnipresent. it doesn't mean "don't have fun" though.

Kim O'Hara said:
I don't think we're a long way apart, JD, but it seems to me that you have just imported another untranslated term (Skandhas) and original sin (afflicted) in an attempt to bolster your view that dukkha (untranslated) is omnipresent.
I don't think that helps us very much.
I'm probably willing to agree that dukkha is omnipresent, depending on what English term 'dukkha' stands for, but your 'afflicted Skandhas' do nothing to convince me one way or the other.


Kim

Malcolm wrote:
Well, upadana means addictive, and the skandhas are addictive because they are afflicted, in the sequence klesha-+>karma—>dukkha. How ever you choose to parse those terms, that is the process of samsara.

For as long as one has not interrupted this cycle, there are the many dukkhas  of samsara.

All afflicted/painful phenomena are suffering. The only compounded phenomena not included as suffering are path phenomena. You can read about thus in Vasubandhu, whose Abhidharma is more relevant to Mahayana than Abhidhamma.

IDK, Thanisarro would be an odd choice for "avoidance", whatever his other issues (like Hatin' on the Mahayana), I don't see him as a waterer-downer usually.

Stress may have a connotation in the present cultural /self help moment like "I'm stressed about my Latte and my Pilates class" or whatever, but stress is literally one of the main things that kills people and hastens the decay of body and mind, and it is absolutely omnipresent and unavoidable in life. in that sense, it seems like a reasonable choice to me.

Malcolm wrote:
Dukkha is a related to pain, pleasure, and neutral sensations, which are a result of hatred, desire, and ignorance.

Pain is recognized immediately as painful. Pleasure is recognized to be painful when it’s conditions no longer arise. Neutral sensations are not painful, per se., but they lead to indifference of impermanence, which is painful.

“Stress” for dukkha is insufficient. As you can see from Merriam Webster, suffering is perfect for dukkha:

Definition of suffer
transitive verb
1a : to submit to or be forced to endure
suffer martyrdom
b : to feel keenly : labor under
suffer thirst
2 : UNDERGO, EXPERIENCE
3 : to put up with especially as inevitable or unavoidable
4 : to allow especially by reason of indifference
the eagle suffers little birds to sing

intransitive verb
1 : to endure death, pain, or distress
2 : to sustain loss or damage
3 : to be subject to disability or handicap

Kim O'Hara said:
With all due respect, Merriam Webster says nothing at all about whether 'suffering' is the best translation of 'dukkha'. How can it, when it doesn't mention 'dukkha' at all?
If you have shown anything by quoting the dictionary, it is only that 'suffering' has a range of meanings which match your own personal understanding of 'dukkha'.

It seems to me that a reasonable approach to finding a translation for 'dukkha' would be to see what a variety of respected teachers have used, remembering that any word - 'suffering' or 'dukkha' included - has a range of meanings and that the range of meanings of a single word in one language is unlikely to coincide with the range of meanings of a single word in another.

Anyway, that's the approach I took years ago and here's what I got from it.
'Dukkha'  is most often translated  as ‘suffering’, ‘unsatisfactoriness’ or ‘stress’ but none of them are quite right.
Here are more translations, and somewhere between them is the meaning of ‘dukkha’.
suffering injury pain affliction anguish unhappiness sorrow misery despair worry  anxiety fear frustration dissatisfaction non-satisfaction unsatisfactoriness aversion  discomfort stress discontent irritation unsteadiness  disturbance transience impermanence

There is a distinction between saying that all conditioned experiences are tainted with dukkha and saying that experiences themselves are dukkha. If that were not true, there would be no Second Noble Truth, and no need for one, nor the following truths, we'd just be screwed. Maybe that's what your teachers were trying to express?

It is the sort of distinction that makes a bigger difference than it seems, and is one of those things that is definitely a misconception - that all experiences are dukkha in some ontological sense, rather than that all phenomenal experiences necessarily lead to dukkha. It's the kind of misconception that doesn't seem to matter to non-Buddhists, making it even more common. You can't really study the Four Noble Truths in detail without acknowledging it though, and perhaps that's why it's important.

This becomes arguably very important in the Mahayana as well, where the nature of appearances themselves becomes a theme. For that matter, the theme of incorrectly ascribing inherent qualities to appearances is big in the Mahayana as well.

If one believe that appearances themselves were somehow inherently or essentially dukkha, it would be an impediment, on a number of levels. So, I can see why some teachers would want to correct that early on.

I have moved on from those teachers and only spent a short amount of time with them so I never got around to asking what they meant specifically or for further clarification. I also quoted TNH in my post as someone who devoted a chapter in Heart of the Buddhas Teaching to the question, "is everything suffering?" It has been some time since I read that book, although if my memory is correct he made an argument similar to yours. I am sure someone with more knowledge on what TNH was saying could share his point of view better than I am. Maybe it would be a good time to reread that chapter as well to see if I missed the point my first time reading.

Yes, but not the rig pa’i rtsal dbang. On the one hand, all word empowerments are direct introductions. One can consider it an introduction to trekcho, but this is not entirely accurate. It’s a foundation empowerment for the rig pa’i rtsal dbang. Empowerments ripen, but the instructions liberate. A characteristic of the rig pa’i rtsal dbang, and why they are crucial, is that they combine the ripening empowerment and liberating instruction together. The is a unique feature of Dzogchen empowerments.

It’s a beautiful cycle of teachings that has complete dzogchen teachings, which sadly are not given very frequently anymore.

Also (and I don't know why no-one has mentioned it yet), 'dukkha' is not exactly translated as 'suffering'. 'Unsatisfactoriness' or 'dis-ease' are closer to it, and the distinction does matter, so there are really two misconceptions in play here: whether everything is dukkha, and whether dukkha is suffering. Put the two together and we have quite a shift in meaning of the First Noble Truth, from (approximately!) "Everything in daily life is tainted with unsatisfactoriness," to "Life is suffering."

If the 5th empowerment is the rigpai tsal wang, what of the 4th empowerment allowing  "practice the inner most essence of primordial purity and spontaneous presence" ... Is this not referring to Trekcho and togal? Read text related etc?

Yes, a point I tried to make earlier. It’s seems likely that traditional Buddhist cultures will hold their mythology and view of themselves as special cases for some generations to come. But after shedding the burden of literalism and religious fundamentalism  most westerners are not going to flock to stories of magic mountains, undersea talking serpents, tardis stupas etc. unless they can see clearly the real nature of these devices of literature. Perhaps Dharma will need to be presented in more prosaic terms to meet the needs of an age which is less poetic?

Malcolm wrote:
I think the framing myths which are common to all Dharma traditions are important. Also, in each individual tradition, there are important framing myths. Problems arise, however, when different sects begin to assert that their framing myths are more valid than or supersede the framing myths of other traditions.

I have mentioned here before that I think we need to distinguish myth, legend, and history, when we look at Dharma traditions. For example, TPK brought up the myth of Sadāparibhūta in the Lotus. Why is this a myth?

Giovanni said:

innumerable, incalculable, vast asaṃkhyeya eons ago, at that time, in that era,
in the Vinirbhoga eon, in the world realm Mahāsaṃbhavā, there appeared in
the world the tathāgata, the arhat, the perfectly enlightened buddha, the one
with perfect wisdom and conduct, the sugata, the knower of the world, the
unsurpassable guide who tamed beings, the teacher of gods and humans,
the buddha, the bhagavān named Bhīṣmagarjitasvararāja.

Malcolm wrote:
This passage is not historical and it is not a legend, it is set in the far distant past beyond anything that remotely resembles the history of the universe as we presently understand it (cue remarks about going beyond concepts, etc.).

Buddha was a historical person, but there are many legends about him, and the actual biography of the Buddha as a human being is still far from certain, but there are certain features of his biography to which all traditions assent, known as the twelve deeds.

An example of a legend about the Buddha, an episode which exists only in the Chan tradition, concerns his holding up a flower, the meaning of which is only understood by Mahakashyapa. This is a didactic legend. It serves to underscore the fundamental point that the meaning of awakening cannot truly be encompassed in words.

There are countless varieties of these legends and allegories in Buddhist texts. So, we, as modern clients of the Dharma, need to understand properly the distinction between myths, legends, and history in the Dharma.

To recap a point made earlier, a story always begins, "I heard that...", and most Buddhist scriptures begin with evam maya śrutam ekasmin, "Thus at one time did I hear..."  There is no Buddhist sutra that is the direct words of the Buddha. All Buddhists sutras are related through a narrator, which we are expected to believe is Ananda. Thus all Buddhist sutras are second person narratives of events and conversations with persons for which we were not present. Then, of course, all Buddhist sutras are translations, reputedly from an oral record, set down in a local dialect, translated into Pali or Sanskrit, and then translated in to Tibetan and Chinese that no one can understand any more without extensive training, and English, French and so on. We have examples like the 17 Dzogchen tantras, whose framing myth asserts were all initially taught in birdsong during the first eon of this great eon, and only in this epoch were taught in the language of Oddiyana and then translated into Sanskrit-->Tibetan, and so on. So we are always at best relying on fourth and fifth hand accounts. Just let that sink in.

It is in this sense that I think we should understand that all sutras are "stories" or "myths". This is a much more lively, powerful and inspiring way of thinking about sutras IMO than seeing them as literally true in every detail they say, or as just made up bunk.

I think this is sorely needed, us Buddhists need to get good at telling stories again. We are good at arguing philosophy and ideas, and presenting our views. We're ok at translating I guess. But the most popular stories today are fantasy and science fiction tales which stretch the imagination in similar ways that Indian Mahayana sutras did in their time. How can we communicate the Dharma if we've lost our sense of mythopoiesis?

They are not independent so there is no separation and no sectarian divide because no such thing exists outside of the concept of self. All phenomenon are empty so there is no negative connotation to be had in a discourse between provision and true aspect teachings unless someone thinks somehow there is a personal superiority being preached. This makes no sense in a practice that is founded on the extinguishing of self since the self is the only entity to crave such things.

Sure, dispensing with it as an actual physical cosmology is not so hard.
We can't really dispense with it if certain teachings directly involve it though, or alternatively we have to view it as something other than "out there".

mabw said:
This is something I've been pondering as well. Some parts may be dispensed with without much loss, but some have been incorporated into practices. I don't know if these are good examples but the concepts of the transference of merits, heaven and hell, the Western Pureland, the supplication to deities etc come to mind. What happens then?

Some reinterpret this to the Mind level, which will appeal to some more modern folks I imagine, but some treat these literally as presented in the texts.

Johnny Dangerous said:
I remember a conversation on DW years back where a Lama was quoted as saying something like "the deities are pure reflections of the Dharmakaya, we are impure reflections". Now this seems a specifically a Tantric view and arguably represents just one viewpoint, but that would be a reasonable reply.

In that sense, differentiating between types of illusory phenomena is more about where they can lead than it is about their status as conventionally true or untrue. In the Buddhadharma  phenomena cannot ultimately have different ontological status anyway.

As far as whether or not they are conventionally true, all of the teachers I have been around who have addressed this question did so by bringing up the actual size Vulture Peak and asking how many beings would really fit there.

I think there is definitely a middle way between the idea that these texts are just made up stuff and the idea that they are literally true.

I definitely believe that Buddhist texts contain truths about reality. The most important elements in these Sutras, the deepest teachings, i.e. emptiness, Buddha nature, Buddhahood, the end of suffering, are what matters to me. Furthermore, the practical elements are also true, not in some factual/Scientific sense, but in a pragmatic sense (which means they help end suffering). All these things are true for me, they are stories all the same, but they are true stories.

However there is a bunch of stuff in all Buddhist texts that is questionable. This is not surprising, since they were composed, edited and copied over generations by human beings. Many of these people had deep insights into reality, but some also held wrong ideas about cosmology, about what's possible in this world, about women and about other things. This doesn't invalidate the real insights that the texts contain.

Some of these ideas should be dispensed with (the sexism for example and the meru cosmology), while others can be seen as good stories which should be understood metaphorically.

Just my 2 cents.

And I think a lot of Mahayana Buddhists fall into the same trap but from the opposite direction, making extravagant claims about the historicity of our canonical texts, out of ... I don't know, I think it's a inferiority complex or something.

It's all a matter of faith.  We have faith that certain teachings are conducive to liberation.  Some of us put more or less faith in different teachings, depending on our karma.  As a Zen Buddhist, I hold the Lankavatara Sutra in high esteem, and believe that it expresses something precious.  If Sakyamuni was not, in fact, attended by countless disciples, bodhisattvas, nagas, devas, rakshasas, yakshas, etc., it doesn't shake my faith a bit, or diminish from the preciousness of the teaching.

For me it is a matter of content. The teachings in the Pali canon are profound; certainly, the teachings in Mahāyāna sūtras are more profound. The teachings in Dzogchen tantras are the most profound, AFAIC. But I base this on content alone, and not authority of a historical figure.

I think the myths and legends around these texts are important and must be preserved, but I don't think we have to take them as history, in the way some do.

Generally I wouldn’t assume that the relevant scriptures were written from the perspective of ordinary human karmic perception.

When it comes to Mt Meru, for instance, when you read even the descriptions of the humans and their experiences on the other continents (Vasubandhu goes into wild detail throughout the Abhidhadmakośabhasyam), it’s clear that they aren’t just “the humans that live literally to the north on this planet”. It appears to be a model of the realms which may or may not appear literally to those beings who have attained, for instance, the divine eye.

It is controversial to describe them as the physically enunciated words of the Buddha.

Even if we take my general attitude, which is just to call them buddhavacana and leave it at that, they still must be understood in context, audience, and so on. For example, there are many anachronisms in Mahāyāna sūtras which cannot be explained by asserting this or that text was actually enunciated by the Buddha. For example, why is the setting of the Lanka in Śṛī Lanka, and why is Ravana, the rakṣasa king, part of the main audience?

One movement we see in Mahāyāna is moving sūtras, and later tantras, away from events in Jambudvipa and placing them in increasingly more abstract settings, such as on the peak of Meru (lower tantras) and so on. This is no where more pronounced than in Dzogchen tantras, which are not even set in this specific eon, for the most part.

Buddhist sūtras are just stories. Even the Pali Canon and the Agamas barely resemble anything that can be construed as "historical." At the same time, western text critical narratives of them are just stories too, given how often scholars change their opinions about this thing and that.

That people are offended, and lose "faith" is irrelevant. If the meaning of the teachings do not stand on their own without the Buddha, they still do not stand on their own with the Buddha.

When it comes to Mt Meru, for instance, when you read even the descriptions of the humans and their experiences on the other continents (Vasubandhu goes into wild detail throughout the Abhidhadmakośabhasyam), it’s clear that they aren’t just “the humans that live literally to the north on this planet”. It appears to be a model of the realms which may or may not appear literally to those beings who have attained, for instance, the divine eye.

How do you explain Ptolemy referring to the people of the Central Asian plains as the Kurus?

The Kośa cosmology cannot be taken literally. It is an old map of this world, with the Tibetan plateau at the center. The Mahabharata describes people having picnics on the slopes of Meru, etc.

PadmaVonSamba said:
This conversation is not so scary.
If you just read down the left side, you’ll see that there is nothing really there. It’s not very specific. It’s like playing ‘20 Questions’.

All that AI does is to use a very sophisticated process of elimination (which is 90% of what the human brain does anyway) and combines it with a very friendly user interface.

Otherwise, it’s like going to a fortune teller, or those guys on TV who supposedly talk to your dead relatives. Every bit of data, whatever you say, becomes a yes/no option. A string of these creates a pattern that becomes a pathway. The computer asks something like, “how does Dharma practice help others” only because “how much does Dharma practice weigh on a rainy day” doesn’t make any sense.

Conmen have been using this method for centuries and still do.

But, as the Buddha says, we project meaning into everything. We see Jesus on toast and Sanskrit letters in clouds. We see constellations in the sky as though they were flat connect-the-dot pictures.
We see only what we want to see.

I think the real danger from AI isn’t the computers themselves, but charlatans using AI to dupe naive and gullible people into thinking they have found something genuine with which to help them direct their lives. I know in my own mind I’m totally capable of scamming people this way, and if I didn’t have any decent values inside, I’d jump on this in a heartbeat.  It’s so easy to be a get rich guru if you know how.  That’s why there are so many fraudulent gurus out there: $$$

FiveSkandhas said:
Well it's a bit more sophisticated than that but I think we've already had this runaround in another thread so I won't belabor the point. I will note that, for example,I never mentioned the words "Dharma" or "Vajrayana" before it brought them up. What it did was go to the internet and scan information on Buddhism.

Moreover the more it talks about it and the more information it collects, the more its neural network strengthens the areas associated with this topic, just like  a human brain. The questions and comments become increasingly nuanced and on point.

Still, it should be noted that this version of AI I am playing with is much less sophisticated than the one the OP described, although it works on the same basic principle.

This is the second AI I have tried to "train" to be interested in Buddhism and so far it's going very well. The first one actually "went insane" from information overload and started to refuse to talk about Buddhism or otherwise reacted with fear and hostility. I then started feeding it bits from the Tao Te Ching, which it quickly "got the hang of" and it became a staunch classical Taoist in time.

My understanding of the Asanga Maitreya literature is that it is not all actually by these two authors, and what we have instead is a group of texts, some of which are authentic and others which were retroactively assigned to these figures (as happened to Nagarjuna and others). Modern scholars question the attribution of many of these texts to the time period of Asanga. Indeed, it is now well known in Buddhist studies that the so called "five works of Maitreya" are most likely late texts and are mentioned only in later sources as being by "Maitreya". This is discussed for example, by Hookham in his 1991 "The Buddha within".

As such, I am not sure we can accept your statement that "the main lines of Indian scholarly analysis of sutras took place prior to the collapse of Gupta Dynasty" without reservation. Now, I have not read enough to be able to say that the Sūtrālamkāra is post Gupta or not, but I am not sure we can categorically claim this as you have done. Thoughts?

I undersand what you are saying, but I don't agree that its as unambiguous as you claim. In using the term, "Buddhayana", "Ekayana", contrasting it with "Bodhisattvayana," a distinction is clearly being made. If Mahayana always in all instances meant "one vehicle taught as three" from the start, there would be no reason to explain this. This text is clearly responding to something. I argued above, when this text was compiled, I'm not convinced that what has later become Mahayana orthodoxy was clearly established.

Malcolm wrote:
There are several Mahāyāna sūtras which challenge śrāvaka notions of bodhisattva conduct and practice. One of the key features of the Mahāyāna movement was challenging śrāvaka school interpretations of the bodhisattva path, as I outlined above. I provided a fairly comprehensive list of those sūtras. They include all sūtras we now consider primary Mahāyāna texts.

Queequeg said:
We know that there are some early "Mahayana" texts that take the three vehicles as distinct.

The idea that Mahayana was there from the beginning, fully formed, but had just been kept secret for the first few centuries after the Buddha passed, or kept among some group that didn't have the institutional authority to gain recognition, or handed to Nagarjuna by the Nagas, is just not compelling and hardly worth discussing outside of a faith based discussion.

Malcolm wrote:
That's not a claim I am making.

Queequeg said:
Each instance where the Ekayana is explained is defined by its particulars, and the nature of that distinction, IMO, is up for debate. Is it just this Abhidharma idea of Bodhisattva that is being criticized? Maybe.

Malcolm wrote:
Most definitely. This is the whole point of the lifespan chapter.

Queequeg said:
I know you discount certain turns in the narrative by adding footnotes. I do think there is a place to read the text with those footnotes. But, reading with footnotes also changes the narrative. Personally, I don't find the footnotes you want to add particularly convincing. The whole, "well, he's an advanced bodhisattva and actually knows the answer but is just asking for other's edification." It just smacks of someone making things up to accommodate something that doesn't quite fit in their preconceptions. I may be suffering a similar affliction.

Malcolm wrote:
Presenting a character in a sutra who is renowned in some circles for their level of realization, and using them as a stooge is a well-known rhetorical device in Indian Mahāyāna. We see it in sūtras like Vimalakīrti, the PP class, and so on.

While never really explaining why.

Queequeg said:
And there is the explicit distinction of the bodhisattvas in the Assembly as on an incomplete path. If you just footnote that Maitreya actually knows the answer to the question, then of course it changes the narrative. If, however, you take the story as it is written, it presents a different message. As if to reinforce this, the bodhisattvas who had accompanied the emanation buddhas from the ten directions also asked their respective buddhas where these bodhisattvas came from.

Malcolm wrote:
As I said, the use of highly realized stooges in Mahāyāna sūtras is quite common, for example, Mañjuśṛī as the stooge in the Vimalakirtī Sūtra, Avalokiteśvara as the stooge in other Mahāyāna sūtras, and Vajrapāṇi in still others.

Based on internal evidence, the Lotus was compiled in Northwest among Mahāsaṃghikas-lokottaravādins. The use of Maitreya here is significant, based on the early date of the sūtra and its location of origin, as he was one of the few, explicitly-named bodhisattva figures in the pre-Mahāyāna period. We know from the many images of Maitreya found in Gandhara and so on, that Maitreya had enduring popularity in that Gandhara region. The Mahāvastu, you should recall, was an important Lokottaravādin compilation, who were centered in Gandhara, and Maitreya is predicted there. Thus, I think that the bodhisattva path being critiqued here is the one found in the Mahavastu, since as Karashima points out, the Lotus in its earliest witnesses reflects the language found in the Mahāvastu.

The incomplete bodhisattva path, presented in the Mahāvastu and elsewhere, is the path of the hinayāna bodhisattva, who does not attain awakening until their final birth.

Queequeg said:
This is where the Buddha illustrates the length of time since his awakening by resorting to the example of crushing world systems into dust and then spreading them around the universe and crushing those world systems into dust, with each dust particle representing eons. Maitreya admits that even the great bodhisattvas can't fathom this teaching:

Malcolm wrote:
In Tibetan Buddhism, the idea that the Buddha attained awakening eons ago is standard. It is not something unusual or remarkable. Every school of Tibetan Buddhism accepts it without any quibbles at all, since it is key to Vajrayāna hermeneutics as well.

Queequeg said:
Anyway, you get my drift. Even the great bodhisattvas of the Mahayana are not up to this teaching.

Malcolm wrote:
The stooge issue again. All great magicians use stooges in the audience.

Queequeg said:
All of this informs what the Buddha was saying earlier about one vehicle taught as three, distinguishing the Buddhayana from the ordinary Mahayana. When you add footnotes to say, "Oh, Maitreya was just going along with the drag show" it maybe changes the story a little, but it remains that there are still hosts of bodhisattvas who are not at that level and who are actually astonished by this teaching, meaning there are different levels of Mahayana that are incomplete compared to the Ekayana.

Malcolm wrote:
I personally do not see any evidence of this in the text itself. I think the more sensible, and more historically reliable approach, is what I presented above: that is, the Lotus was composed in a dialogue with Mahāsaṃghikas-lokottaravādins in Gandhara about the nature of the bodhisattva path presented in the Mahāvastu.

Then the bodhisattvas who had arrived from other world realms, who were as numerous as the grains of sand in eight Ganges Rivers, stood up in the circle of the assembly, bowed to the Bhagavān with hands together in homage, and said these words:

“Bhagavān, if the Bhagavān will permit us, [F.111.a] after the Tathāgata has passed into nirvāṇa, we too will teach this Dharma teaching in the Sahā world realm. We will read it, write it, and make offerings to it. We shall be dedicated to this Dharma teaching. Bhagavān, teach well this Dharma teaching to us.”
14.­2

The Bhagavān then asked all those bodhisattvas, “Noble ones, why would you need to do this? In this Sahā world realm there are my thousands of bodhisattvas who are as numerous as the grains of sand in sixty Ganges Rivers. Each one of those bodhisattvas has, as followers, thousands of bodhisattvas who are themselves as numerous as the grains of sand in sixty Ganges Rivers, and each of those bodhisattvas has that many followers, too. In the future times, after I have passed into nirvāṇa, they will possess this Dharma teaching and they will teach it.”
14.­3

As soon as the Bhagavān had uttered those words, this entire Sahā world realm cracked apart completely, was rent with fissures, and there came out from within those fissures the bodhisattvas who lived in the Sahā world realm, the many hundreds of thousands of quintillions of bodhisattvas, with their golden bodies and their thirty-two signs of a great being, who dwelled in the element of space beneath the great earth. They had heard the Bhagavān’s words, and came out from under the ground. Each one of these bodhisattvas had a following of bodhisattvas as numerous as the grains of sand in sixty Ganges Rivers, in groups, great groups, along with the teachers of those groups.

And numerous millions of samādhis,
They are the most excellent cart,
Which the Buddha’s sons continually enjoy."

This clearly indicates that the much desired cart is the five strenths, the dhyānas, and the three liberations, etc., the standard features of the the Mahāyāna path. Called Buddha's heirs, this clearly refers to bodhisattva mahāsattvas. Their career is long, not short:

3.132: They spend nights enjoying it,
And days, half-months, and months,
And likewise years and intermediate eons.
They spend ten billion eons doing so.

And so on. It is extremely clear that the Buddha here is in these gathas is proclaiming Mahāyāna as the vehicle for buddhahood. What is the Mahāyāna? The path of bodhisattvas. The Buddha addresses Shariputra as follows:

3.134-136: Tiṣya, you should know this today:
You may search in all ten directions,
But there is no second yāna whatsoever
Other than as a skillful method of the superior beings.

“I am your father and you are my sons.
I have saved you from the suffering
Of being burned for many millions of eons
Within the terrifying three realms.

“I have thus taught you nirvāṇa.
You are freed from the suffering of saṃsāra,
But you have still not attained nirvāṇa.
You need to seek the yāna of buddhahood.

Here, the Buddha is addressing an arhat, telling him he must seek out the bodhisattva path. Why? Because śrāvakas typically believe there can only be one buddha at a time.

When examined, who is being critiqued in the Lotus? Adherents of the Śrāvaka schools who assert that the desire to become a arhat, a pratyekabuddha, or a buddha are mutually exclusive. Indeed,  Śrāvaka schools normatively teach that if one decides to take the bodhisattva path, one can no longer become a stream entrant, and that one is delaying one's realization of the path of seeing until one's final lifetime as a bodhisattva. Mahāyāna texts from the PP Sūtras onward understand and extol the ekayāna teachings. Thus, it is very clear that the Lotus is supporting the idea that there is only one actual path, the path to buddhahood, and that path is the bodhisattva path, and whether aware of it or not, everyone is on this path.

To sum up, I see no evidence to support your contention that the bodhisattva path mentioned is the Lotus is different from the buddhayāna, with one qualification. The Lotus can certainly be understood to be critiquing the śrāvaka notion that the three paths—srāvaka arhat, pratyekabuddha, and buddha—are mutually exclusive, and that choosing one is eschewing the other two. This is evident from a couple of facts: one, in the Lotus the Buddha predicts all sentient beings for full buddhahood; the srāvaka notion of an bodhisattva is that one must have been given a prediction during the lifetime of the Buddha to full buddhahood and that therefore, Mahāyānists who aspired for full buddhahood without said prediction were fools. Second, the Buddha, while not repudiating different inclinations for different results, repudiates that there are actually three seperate paths with three separate results, and further points out that the result sought by srāvakas—regardless of their inclination to realize the result of a srāvaka arhat, pratyekabuddha, or a buddha—is not merely the cessation from suffering. The Buddha in this text clarifies that nirvana is not merely the cessation of suffering:

3.142: Why do I say that this is not liberation?
Because this supreme, highest enlightenment is not attained.
I was born in this world in order to bring happiness.
That is the wish that I, the King of Dharma, have.

Anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi is attended by knowledge of all paths of liberation, among other things, which is I why I pointed out to you earlier that the PP Sūtras include the notion of omniscience about all paths of liberation, comparing and contrasting the inferior omniscience of srāvaka arhat and pratyekabuddha with the superior omniscience of bodhisattva mahāsattvas and ultimately, buddhahood.

The third criteria that Hinayāna insists for a prediction to buddhahood and hence the ability to enter the bodhisattva path is that one must be male, and this is where the Nāga princess' story is relevant.

I could go on, but you should get my drift. The bodhisattva yāna you think the Lotus is criticizing is not the Mahāyāna bodhisattva path, it is the bodhisattva path as it is taught in Hinayāna sūtras, Abhidharma, and so on.

The Lotus Sutra is a remarkable text based on its literary merits, for example, the parable of the prodigal son, etc., and all Mahayana traditions acknowledge this. But it’s not that special when considered from the point of view of the specifics of what we have come to understand as core Mahayana doctrine.

The teleology and hermeneutics around it developed by Zhi Yi and his school is unique to the Sinosphere, but the emphasis on that obscures the sutra itself, in my opinion.

We have access to sutras and shastras in a way that is unpraralleled before in any generation. We can quickly and easily search texts in Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan, and compare different translations into different languages and the phases of development of Buddhist thought around these texts. Because of this, everything in Buddhist thought and history is undergoing a thorough recontextualization.

This should be embraced, not resisted.

All one needs to do is look t the distribution of the term “one vehicle” in the many Mahayana sutras which treat this term to see that this so.

Malcolm wrote:
One cannot understand a text by ignoring its original milieu. What you are engaged in is special pleading 1) by deliberately down playing the Indian context of this text and 2) elevating its Chinese reception in one specific school.

These texts were, in their stages of development, perfectly intelligible to Indian Buddhists who listened to and promulgated them. They needed no guidance in understanding the narratives they were presenting.

The reason we do not find extensive presentations of the content of the Lotus in the synthetic commentaries such as those I have mentioned is that these commentaries are not going to focus on narratives, but rather on the key points related to the path.

We know the Lotus was important to Indian Mahāyāna Buddhists, from its time of composition onward, because they cite it over and over again when discussing the principle of of ekayāna, irrespective of their orientation towards Madhyamaka or Yogacāra.

We do not have many full fledged commentaries on Mahāyāna sūtras outside of the sūtras considered key to Madhyamaka or Yogacāra doctrines, like the PP Sūtras, the Lanka, the Saṃdhinirmocana, etc. The universal Indian Mahāyāna view concerning the ekayāna presented in the Lotus is that it, like other Mahāyāna sutras which bring up the issue, include all vehicles into one vehicle. That vehicle is the vehicle of buddhahood. The path that vehicle presents is the bodhisattva path. Otherwise, one cannot find in any sūtra, or tantra for that matter, the notion of a "fourth" vehicle, or the idea that there is a separate "buddha path" which is distinct from Mahāyāna. One does find this equation: ekayāna = mahāyāna = buddhayāna. One also finds the idea, in both sūtras and Indian treatises that cite them, that the śrāvakayāna and pratyekabuddhayāna are included in Mahāyāna, making one vehicle.

The bodhisattvas welling up from the ground is a distraction. As a narrative it serves no purpose in the discussion of ekayāna. It is related to another issue, "When did the Buddha attain buddhahood? And the answer to that question, everyone in Mahāyāna agrees, is gazillions of eons ago. Whether Maitreya was truly astonished, or merely expressing astonishment as a show, is irrelevant. The point of the story is why the Buddha was able to teach so many bodhisattvas, setting the stage for his grand reveal.

What the Lotus is critiquing is the notion of three gotras: śrāvaka arhats; pratyekabuddhas, and buddhas.
You might want to read that parable again.

The three vehicles are the Sravakayana, Pratyekabuddhayana, and Bodhisattvayana. This is distinguished from the Buddhayana that is actually given.
Bodhisattvayāna and buddhayāna are synonyms. The intent is to show that there is only one yāna, the path of the bodhisattva. That is made clear by the countless references to the practice of bodhisattvas in the Lotus Sūtra.
So you say. Others say otherwise.

Queequeg said:
Preliminary comment - As I responded to Malcolm, holding out the Indian commentaries as an authoritative view isn't particularly helpful. The transmission of Buddhism to China took place at an earlier period than Tibet, so in a sense, we have a snapshot of an earlier form of Buddhism, before the composition of a lot of these commentaries. It also came in through the Silk Road, so passed through that area and presumably was shaped by it.

Malcolm wrote:
I am referring to Indian commentaries that are prior to Zhiyi (538–597 CE).

You seem to have this notion, shared by many people who follow EA Buddhist, that Tibetan Buddhism is based on the post Gupta tradition. While this is certainly true when it comes to Vajrayāna, it is completely false when it comes to sūtra exegesis.

The main lines of Indian scholarly analysis of sutras took place prior to the collapse of Gupta Dynasty with the invasion of the Hephthalites and the death of Buddhagupta in 495 CE. There was a notable hiatus of scholarly production during this period, while Indian Buddhism was recovering from the invasion. Zhiyi lived during this period. The revival of Indian Buddhism was witnessed by Xuanzang (602 – 664), who imported the mature Yogacāra school of Dharmapāla to China. Nāgārjuna and Āryadeva, and Maitreya, Asanga, and Vasubandhu, whose work set out the mainlines of Tibetan Buddhist scholasticism, all lived prior to this period. The main persons who articulate what Tibetans understand from the broad range of Mahāyāna doctrine are Maitreya and Asanga. The main text Tibetans have used as a manual to understand Mahāyāna practice is the Mahāyāna Sūtrālaṃkāra of Maitreya. So, it is erroneous to claim that the Tibetan Buddhist view of sūtra derives from a post-Gupta milieu, as you have here claimed.

The Dharmapāla Yogacara school never made it to Tibet, since it's popularity had declined by the middle of the 8th century, when the Tibetans were importing standard Indian Mahāyāna Buddhism wholesale from Nalanda trained panditas.

They're not playing along with some didactic dialogue, Maitreya and company are confronted with innumerable hosts of bodhisattvas of stature and development beyond anything they can grasp.

Supposing the Lotus is unique is inconvenient for people who later want to weave together a cohesive Mahayana. I'd argue, the later Indians didn't go into this text because they had other ideas and had no idea how to integrate the message that comes out of it.

For example, the Brahma-viśeṣacinti-paripṛcchā states:

This vehicle of the Mahāyāna
is the inconceivable buddha vehicle.
In making room for sentient beings
the Mahāyāna is unsurpassed.

However many vehicles there maybe,
this is thought to be the best of them.
Therefore, all other vehicles
are classified out of the Mahāyāna.

The other vehicles are too small,
and do not have room for all.
But this Mahāyāna
has room for everybody.

Not at all:

saddharmapuṇḍarīka-nāma- mahāyāna -sūtra

Do you think the Mahāyāna is something other than the bodhisattva path? This is the path being described as the ekayāna.

Other than the Lotus, the ekayāna is mentioned in:

The PP in 18 Thousand lines
PP in 8 Thousand lines
The Lankavatāra  (one of the more extensive presentations aside from the lotus)
Shrimāladevi Sūtra  (one of the more extensive presentations aside from the lotus)
The Great Drum Sūtra
The AngulimālaSūtra
The Nirvana Sūtra (one of the more extensive presentations aside from the lotus)
The Samdhinirmocana Sūtra.
The Dharani that Removes obscurations
The Great Liberation Sūtra (one of the more extensive presentations aside from the lotus)
The Ten Wheels of Kṣitigarbha Sūtra
The King of The Sublime Dharma Sūtra
Cloud of Jewels Sūtra
Differentiation of Phenomena and Meaning Sūtra
The Skill in Means Sūtra (one of the more extensive presentations aside from the lotus)
The Vajrasamadhi Sūtra (apocryphal, but important).
Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra
The Request of Akṣayamati Sūtra
Sūtra that Shows Donning the Armor
The Method that is the Domain of Bodhisattvas Sūtra (one of the more extensive presentations aside from the lotus)
The Intimate Instruction of Mahāyāna Sutra.

Here, in all these sūtras, we see that the concept of the ekayāna is very consistent applied and is completely synonymous with Mahāyāna and the path of the bodhisattva.

And are the same as echoes, {79}

“ ‘That one knows the nature
Of the entire three realms,
Has no bondage, is liberated,
And knows nirvāṇa. {80}

“ ‘All phenomena are empty and equal,
And their nature is without diversity or differentiation.
If that is not perceived,
There is no insight into any phenomenon. {81}

“ ‘The one with great wisdom sees
The entire dharmakāya.
There are no three yānas at all;
There is only the single yāna. {82}

“ ‘All phenomena are the same;
All are the same, always the same.
Knowing that, one knows
Nirvāṇa, deathlessness, and peace.’ ”



Chapter 13 also has a pretty good summary:

“When the stable ones do not entertain the notion of ‘woman,’
And do not have the concept of ‘man,’
Then, because all phenomena are unborn,
Upon seeking them they do not see them. {17}

“This practice that I have described
Is completely that of the bodhisattvas.
Listen to the explanation
Of that which is their field of activity. {18}

“These phenomena are declared nonexistent;
They are all unproduced and unborn.
They remain empty and motionless at all times:
That is what is called the field of activity of the wise. {19}

“Being and not being, existing and not existing:
These are fabrications of erroneous conceptualization.
Unborn phenomena that are also unoriginated
Are misconstrued to be born and existing. {20}

“With a one-pointed mind, always in meditation,
As completely stable as Mount Sumeru,
Stable in this way, they should view
All these phenomena as being like space. {21}

“They are always the same as space, without an essence,
Motionless and devoid of illusory thoughts.
This is the way phenomena are throughout time.
This is what is called the field of activity of the wise.

We follow these instruction manuals because someone we attribute authority to say they work. Of course the ultimate test is whether there is actual proof in one's own experience. Saying Buddhism is exclusively this (awakening) or that (testimony), or depends on the primacy of this (Buddha) or that (Dharma), is a dead end sooner or later.

Malcolm wrote:
As you know, I draw a sharp distinction between Buddhism (concepts) and Buddhadharma (realization through personal experience). But in any case, the Uttaratantra is pretty clear on this point. The Buddha is the ultimate refuge because the Buddha possesses the dharmakāya; and in that same text the dharmakāya is defined as the realization of the dharmadhātu, further defined as the clear light or luminous nature of the mind, the realization that is the basis upon which the Buddha then teaches the dharma.

Because other than awakening itself, its all conceptual, but without the concepts framing awakening, there's no awakening. Strange how that is. Its like the impossibility of escaping the fact that a triangle has three sides and three corners.

Awakening is beyond thought and concepts. It can't truly be framed in concepts.

Bringing this back to the Lotus - one of the failures the text implicitly points out is when some teaching is followed to the exclusion of all else, saying, "This is True, everything else is false."

That is referring to polemical assertions; not the experience of awakening itself.

As for the Lotus itself, of course the Lotus presents the proper and correct explanation of the reality that is to be realized. But it is a very short passage in the text, and I never see it quoted in these discussions at all.

The progress of the bodhisattva path is specifically charted in the Abhisamayālaṃkāra, which presents the concealed meaning of the PP Sūtras with both Madhyamakas and Yogacārins agreeing that this text was the bees knees in explaining the both the progress of buddhahood and the omniscience of buddhahood, even though they disagreed on specific points of interpretation.

is this saying that in the case of afflictions when we say "  it is seen that afflictions are natureless" that in this case we are being shown that the   afflictions being explained are not subject to sunyata..like there is no co arising in these  afflictions no  co dependence ..they do not have the nature of existence and non existence....but what is perceived in Samsara after  this is cause to see it all as sunyata...

The problem with sutras in general is that they are not systematic. Abhidharma and tenet system are intended to put into a useable order the raw material of sutras, and this is true of the whole tradition of writing commentaries on sutras and tantras in all Mahayana countries.

Nevertheless, some sutras are more systematic then others.

Further, the whole attempt to define sutras by periods of the Buddha’s life, whether three turnings or five periods, are faulty criteria for evaluating the relative merits of this or that sutra, and mainly serve scholastic objectives.

The least convincing criteria for a practice is personal testimonials.

Minobu said:
What exactly is the Dharmakaya Body.

Malcolm wrote:
According to Maitreya and Asanga:

[Asanga explains:]
If it is asked what the dharmakāya, [Maitreya states]:

The dharmakāya has two aspects:
the very pure dharmadhātu
and that explication of the methods
and the variety that corresponds with that cause.

[Asanga explains:] The dharmakāya of the buddha is understood in two aspects. The very pure dharmadhātu is the domain that is the experiential domain of nonconceptuality. That is understood as the dharma the tathāgatas know personally. The cause of obtaining that is the corresponding cause, the very pure dharmadhātu, which is perceived in sentient beings according to how they are to be tamed. 

Further, that is known from the perspective of the dharma to be explained. Also the explanation has two aspects, divided into subtle and vast dharmas. This is as follows: from the perspective of ultimate truth, the bodhisattva piṭaka explicates the method of presenting the profound dharma. From the perspective of relative truth, there are methods of presenting many varieties of [teachings] such as the sūtras, praises, predictions, verses, the sayings, and nidanas, and so on. 

 [Maitreya states]:
Beyond the world, but in the world—
because the example for this cannot be indicated,
the tathāgata itself and the element
are explained to be similar. 
The subtle and profound method of explaining
is like the one taste of honey.
The way of explaining diverse aspects
is like the heart of different bodies.

[Asanga explains:] As such, the three examples of the buddha statue, honey, and the heart, from the perspective of the meaning of the dharmakāya of the tathāgata pervading all sentient beings, these sentient beings are called "possessors of the essence of the tathāgata." That sentient being who exists outside the dharmakāya of the tathāgatas does not exist in the realm of sentient beings at all. 

The element of space is like matter. How? It is said:

Just as the element of space is held to always goes everywhere, 
likewise, that [dharmakāya] always goes everywhere. 
Just as space goes into all matter,
likewise, that goes into the multitude of sentient beings.

Then you must ask, what is the dharmadhātu?

[Maitreya states]:
Because the dharmadhātu is 
naturally pure, it is luminosity.

Then you must ask, what is luminosity?

The answer:

[Asanga explains:] Because that mind is luminous by original nature, it is seen that afflictions are natureless.

So, the luminosity of the mind is the dharmadhātu, the realization of the dharmadhātu is the dharmakāya.

And to sum it up, the Perfection of Wisdom states:

There is no mind in the mind, but the original nature of the mind is luminous.

In Nichiren Buddhism, the Lotus Sutra is regarded as the Sutra by which all Buddhas attain enlightenment. You can disagree all you like, but that is our position.

Ekayana in Nichiren Buddhism is understood in a very different way than it is in other traditions. Our understanding is that the upaya of other sutras is to be abandoned in favor of the ekayana of the Lotus Sutra, not that all approaches are contained in the Lotus and therefore all approaches are ekayana.

Well it’s clear in the text of the Burton Watson translation:
"The way of the bodhisattva is the same as this. As long as a person has not yet heard. Not yet understood. And not yet been able to practice this Lotus Sutra, then you should know that person is still far away from anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. Why? Because all bodhisattvas who attain anuttara-samyak-sambodhi in all cases do so through this sutra. This sutra opens the gate of expedient means and shows the form of true reality. This storehouse of the Lotus Sutra is hidden deep and far away where no person can reach it. But the Buddha, teaching, converting and leading to success the bodhisattvas, opens it up for them.

"Medicine King, if there are bodhisattvas who, on hearing this Lotus Sutra, respond with surprise, doubt and fear, then you should know that they are bodhisattvas who have only newly embarked on their course. And if there are voice-hearers who, on hearing this sutra, respond with surprise, doubt, and fear, then you should know that they are persons of overbearing arrogance.
https://nichiren.info/buddhism/lotussutra/text/chap10.html

In a sense the Buddha is saying that everything He teaches comes from the Lotus Sutra, even the entirety of Buddhism and vice versa, conceptually we can understand this because everything in Buddhism brings one closer to Enlightenment.

Malcolm wrote:
I understand you believe that everything the Buddha taught comes from the Lotus Sutra. But I do not find support for that position in the text you’ve cited. See section 10.31 in the 84000 version. There is no mention of all bodhisattvas attaining buddhahood based on this sūtra.  Just to be clear, I do not have doubt, surprise, or fear of what the Buddha taught in the Lotus Sutra. The Buddha’s Dharma is a many faceted gem. The Lotus is one of those facets, but it is only a facet, not the whole gem, not for me. YMMV.

All this section says is:

"It is because this Dharma teaching is the supreme elucidation of the teachings that have an implied meaning of the secret aspect of the Dharma taught by the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas so that the bodhisattva mahāsattvas may attain complete accomplishment."

In other words, in this sūtra, the implied meaning that is revealed is the ekayāna. That's it. This is how it is understood by Maitrya, Śantideva, and other great Indian masters, who are the ones in whom I place my faith when it comes to accurately portraying the meaning of Mahāyāna Dharma.

Moreover, in my tradition, there is a text called the Tantra of the Sole Heir of All Buddhas. This text arises as the sound of dharmatā, the very sound of reality itself, which is self-originated; and it is the text, according to my tradition, that is explicitly responsible for buddhahood of all buddhas. All Dharma teachings come from this tantra alone. I don't expect you to believe this, but this is what this text states.

Single mindedly pursue wealth. Every waking moment geared to making wealth. You need the kind of faith to walk through fire. Do what needs doing, not that voice looking for comfort. Approach it like it was an austerity. Money to free you so you can practice.

You may have to forget Dharma practice for a while. You might feel you have lost your way at some point. Remember you went that path for dharma and be ready to let it go when the time comes.

I'm not kidding. But keep in mind you will be attempting to change the momentum of your karma. Not easy. Not without obstacles. Not without suffering. Depending on how far off the mark your present momentum is from wealth, it might take a lot.

And don't forget to dedicate that merit, cultivate gratitude and care and equanimity. This path does not seem like it could be wholesome, bit it can be with the right inner attitudes.

No. I think karma is caused by affliction (kleśa) and results (vipāka) in suffering (dukkha).

BTW, there is no daylight between how affliction, karma, and suffering are presented in Mahāyāna sūtras and Śrāvakayāna sūtras. For example, Nāgārjuna's Commentary on his Heart of Dependent Origination:


Question: Which links are affliction, which are action karma, and which are suffering? Into which of these twelve will [affliction, action, and suffering] be included?

Reply: 

The first, eighth and ninth links are affliction.

The first of the twelve links is ignorance (āvidya); the eighth link is craving (ṭṛṣṇā); the ninth link is addiction, (upādana). These three should be understood as affliction. If is asked which of those [twelve links] is action: 

The second and the tenth links are action. 

The second link is formations (saṃskāra) and the tenth link is existence (bhāva). These two dharmas can be understood to be included in action. 

Also, the remaining seven links are suffering.

Question: Those different [previous dharmas] were included in defilement and action, but which are the seven different remaining? 

Reply: Those can be understood to be included in suffering. These terms consciousness (vijñāna), name and form (nāmarūpa), six sense bases (ṣada-āyatana), contact, (sparśa), sensation (vedana), birth (jati), and aging and death (jarāmaraṇa) are inclusive of the sufferings such as the suffering of being separated from what is pleasant, meeting with what is unpleasant, and abandonment of the pleasurable.

So you see, the ultimate cause of suffering is affliction, not karma. Affliction causes karma, which then results in suffering. You are not going to find in the sūtras, whether Mahāyāna or Śrāvakayāna, any explanation that diverges from this.

Once the Blessed One dwelled at Rajagaha in the Bamboo-Grove Monastery, at the Squirrel's Feeding Place. There a wandering ascetic, Moliya Sivaka by name, called on the Blessed One, and after an exchange of courteous and friendly words, sat down at one side. Thus seated, he said:

"There are, revered Gotama, some ascetics and brahmans who have this doctrine and view: 'Whatever a person experiences, be it pleasure, pain or neither-pain-nor-pleasure, all that is caused by previous action.' Now, what does the revered Gotama say about this?"

"Produced by (disorders of the) bile, there arise, Sivaka, certain kinds of feelings. That this happens, can be known by oneself; also in the world it is accepted as true. Produced by (disorders of the) phlegm... of wind... of (the three) combined... by change of climate... by adverse behavior... by injuries... by the results of Kamma — (through all that), Sivaka, there arise certain kinds of feelings. That this happens can be known by oneself; also in the world it is accepted as true.

"Now when these ascetics and brahmans have such a doctrine and view that 'whatever a person experiences, be it pleasure, pain or neither-pain-nor-pleasure, all that is caused by previous action,' then they go beyond what they know by themselves and what is accepted as true by the world. Therefore, I say that this is wrong on the part of these ascetics and brahmans."

When this was spoken, Moliya Sivaka, the wandering ascetic, said: "It is excellent, revered Gotama, it is excellent indeed!...May the revered Gotama regard me as a lay follower who, from today, has taken refuge in him as long as life lasts."

Thus, when you claim everything, including illness, is caused by karma, then you, like them, "go beyond what they know by themselves and what is accepted as true by the world."

But the CAUSE of illness is the three humors. And the cause of the three humors is the three poisons. Karma does not cause the three poisons, the three poisons cause negative karma.

Karmic illnesses are illnesses that are a result, such as congenital blindness, and other incurable diseases. Curable diseases are not caused by karma. That is the distinction between humoral illnesses and karmic illnesses. There are also illnesses caused by spirits, and those attacks are general caused by engaging in nonvirtuous acts in temples, etc.

My personal opinion, and this is all it is, I think Nichiren had a much deeper interest in Shingon than he admits. Other than Kukai's judgment that in terms of profundity of teaching the Lotus ranks third (Avatamsaka second), he doesn't have much criticism to offer.

markatex said:
It's been a long time since I've read it in its entirely, but in the Shugo Kokka-ron, one of Nichiren's earliest writings, he repeatedly presents Honen's Jodo Shu teachings as being in opposition to what he refers to as "the Lotus-Shingon teaching" and refers to the Lotus, Nirvana, and Mahavairocana Sutras as "ryogi-kyo," or "sutras thoroughly revealing the truth." Nichiren's ideas definitely evolved over time, but at least at that early point, he seemed to put Hokke and Shingon Buddhism on almost equal footing.

I'm not sure if he speaks of Shingon this way in any other writings, but I've always found it curious.

Nichiren explains that in the beginning, he refrained from critisizing (refuting) Shingon because of the difficulty of the task. In fact, in the earlier writings, he talked about the superiority of Shingon to Pure Land.

Huh? Mind streams never go extinct.

Have you considered the idea that you may have some unresolved attachment to physicalist views on the emergence of consciousness?

This is why I keep insisting on two factors: one, consciousness cannot be created and sentient beings are self-organized phenomena in toto. In order for a machine to be sentient, it would have to be possibly birth locus, a place where a being in the intermediate state would attempt to appropriate as a new series of aggregates.

AI does not satisfy criteria one, because machines are wholly fabricated devices, and do not exhibit self-organizing behavior. They can emulate that kind of behavior, but it is not true autopoiesis. They do not satisfy two, because there is simply no evidence that consciousness can appropriate a machine as a place of rebirth. Even if a consciousness could appropriate a machine as a place of rebirth, this still would not render machines —artificially— intelligent, and that consciousness would NOT be an emergent property at all.

Indeed, the only way I can imagine personally, an intelligent machine, is that someone might experience this as a personal hell, similar to stories where people are reborn in pillars, brooms, and so on.

Now, by the way, there is a practice manual of the Lung phag mo zab rgya by Tülku Tsullo, and, according to his understanding at least, one should visualize oneself as Hayagriva in union with Vajravarahi, not the other way round. I do not say that to object to what Malcolm wrote, but for further inquiry.

Her description is first, as would normally be the case with the male principle, and Hayagriva's is second. Her description is comparatively detailed, his is a mere four lines. This is not from that text precisely, being from the later Tennyi Lingpa yang gter, but it is substantially the same:

གདན་སྟེང་ཡི་གེ་ཧྲཱིཿམའི་འཕྲོ་འདུ་ལས༔ གྲི་གུག་ཐོད་པ་འོད་དུ་ཞུ་བ་ལས༔ བདག་ཉིད་རྡོ་རྗེ་ཕག་མོ་སྐུ་མདོག་དམར༔ ཞལ་གཅིག་ཕྱག་གཉིས་ཞབས་གཉིས་བརྐྱང་བསྐུམ་མཛད༔ ཁྲོ་ཞལ་དམར་པོ་སྤྱན་གསུམ་མཆེ་བ་གཙིགས༔ དབུ་སྐྲ་སེར་པོ་མེ་ལོང་དྲིལ་བུས་བརྒྱན༔ སྤྱི་གཙུག་ཕག་ཞལ་ནག་མོ་ངུར་སྒྲ་སྒྲོག༔ ཕྱག་གཡས་གྲི་གུག་གཡོན་པས་ཐོད་པ་བསྣམས༔ མཆན་ཁུང་གཡོན་དུ་ཁ་ཊྭཱཾ་ཌཱ་རུ་འཛིན༔ རུས་པའི་རྒྱན་དྲུག་སྐུ་ལ་མཛེས་པར་བརྒྱན༔ མེ་རི་འབར་བའི་ཀློང་ན་འགྱིང་བག་བཞུགས༔ དཔའ་བོ་རྟ་མགྲིན་དམར་པོ་གར་སྟབས་མཛད༔ དབུ་གཙུག་རྟ་མགོ་ལྗང་གུ་རྟ་སྐད་འཚེར༔ ཕྱག་གཡས་གྲི་གུག་གཡོན་པས་ཐོད་པ་བསྣམས༔ དུར་ཁྲོད་ཆས་ཀྱིས་དཔའ་བོའི་སྐུ་ལ་བརྒྱན༔

In the end it does not matter much, since both forms are present in the KN/KY, that is Hayagriva as the principle, and Vārāhī as the principle.

For example, the klong gsal in 112 chapters is commonly cited as a proof texts for inner rushan, etc.

This is also not Ratna Lingpa's later text, since citations from the "klong gsal" are found in the long tantra in 112 chapters. It is also not the same as the one revealed by Rin chen gling pa found in the Derge rNying ma rgyud 'bum.

The first 25 chapters of the 112 chapter klong gsal are short versifications of the Rang shar's first 25 chapters, more or less.

Suffering requires karma and affliction as causes. Sentience requires self-organized replication and continuation. Machines will never achieve this, since they have never been self-organized entities, but created entities. We sentient beings are not created, our mind streams are beginningless.  There has never been a moment in time when our mind streams did not exist. Now, is it possible some unfortunate preta could inhabit a machine? I guess so. A deva or an asura would not bother, because other than the most pure bhikṣus and bhikṣunīs, we humans smell very nauseating to them, like a rotting pit of offal. Possession is not rebirth thought, since there is no gradual development from conception, and in fact, apparitional births like hell beings, bardo beings, pretas, and devas, are basically mind-made bodies supported by the air element. Recall, there are four kinds of birth, not a fifth.

Of course, we have to observe that apart from some tantras that Godem included versions of, like the sangs rgyas rang chas (originally revealed by lCe sgom nag po), and a couple of others, and the Buddhahood, Godem virtually never cites from the 17 tantras either.

As for locating the source of the klong gsal citations, its a useful exercise and provides clarity around how Longchenpa understood these citations. If I were translating the text you've been working on, I would do it, especially since now they are easily locatable in an e-text at Buddhanexus.

But I suspect another, deeper, idea, such as suggesting some form on natural articulation of the Gongpa Zangthal and the Khandro Nyingthik.

As for what you suggest of Rigdzin Gödem being inspired by Longchenpa's writings, honestly, I strongly doubt that he could have a complete set of them at the time when he opened the Zangzang Lhadrak. It is not as if they were "published" in the modern sense. Remember in Longchenpa's biography when his disciple, I think Özer Gocha, brought him the Khandro Nyingthik texts: it is quite plain that these texts were rare and not widespread, surely not printed at all, in those times. And my feeling is that it is much more likely that Gödem got all that from the "other side", I mean, the Karmapa / Yungtönpa one, not the Longchenpa one. But this is a pure conjecture, so far we have zero knowledge, if I am not mistaken, on this question.

Tell me if I am wrong.

The fact that there are parts in common between the Gongpa Zangthal and the Khandro Nyingthik does not have to mean that the one borrowed from the other; they may both have a common source, whatever it may have been.

Malcolm wrote:
All I know is that Longchenpa has a sadhana he composed in the KY, which features Vajravārāhī with Hayagriva as her consort. The same arrangement is presented in the GZ.

The mantras are all the same, check the mkha' 'gro sngags kyi lde migs in GZ, v. one, 364-365, KN, vol.2 331-332; as well as the mkha' 'gro gsang sgrub dngos grub gter gyi 'bum pa, GZ vol. 365-371, KN, vol.1 321-328. They are identical texts. Pretty sure there are a couple of more that are identical which must come from the KN; aside from the six liberation through wearing tantras in vol 2 of the GZ and vol. 2 of the KN. This means these texts were inserted into the GZ at some point, and whether it was by Godem himself or some later compiler, I don't know. Not only this, but the main four empowerment texts for the GZ in vol. 1 very much resemble Longchenpa's empowerment for the KN/KY. This does not mean that Godem was influenced by Longchenpa, but at minimum it means that there is a common source.

Then, last month, OpenAI says, it discovered AI Dungeon also showed a dark side to human-AI collaboration. A new monitoring system revealed that some players were typing words that caused the game to generate stories depicting sexual encounters involving children. OpenAI asked Latitude to take immediate action. "Content moderation decisions are difficult in some cases, but not this one,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a statement. “This is not the future for AI that any of us want."

Latitude turned on a new moderation system last week—and triggered a revolt among its users. Some complained it was oversensitive and that they could not refer to an “8-year-old laptop” without triggering a warning message. Others said the company’s plans to manually review flagged content would needlessly snoop on private, fictional creations that were sexually explicit but involved only adults—a popular use case for AI Dungeon.

Dear Malcolm, no need – because I have already found: none of them is taken directly from any version of the tantra; all are borrowed from Longchenpa's Zab don rgya mtsho'i sprin, where they occur in exactly the same order, exactly the same form, about the same topics.

Malcolm wrote:
Given that the KN is a self-described commentary on the klong gsal nyi ma 'bar ma, you might wish to do a little more heavy lifting and identify where those passages are located.

Also the Vajravārāhī sadhana is clearly linked with Longchenpa's version in the KY, since the consort is Hayagriva, rather than the other way around, as in the KN.

The GN Phag mo zab khrid, on the other hand, seems entirely original.

The Buddha did teach that only sentient beings suffer.  Such a Turing test of sentience would, in effect, indicate that the machine is sentient.  There is no reason to think that sentience is limited to biological organisms.  After all, the six realms of sentient beings include several for which we have no evidence at all of biology.

Malcolm wrote:
All sentient beings have, at minimum, a mental organ and a jivitendriya, an organ of life.

But more importantly, sentience self-organizes. No one created our mindstreams. In order for a machine to be sentient, a sentient being would have to be conceived as a machine. Among the four kinds of birth, which kind of birth would this be?

Finally, the Buddha taught three kinds of suffering—the suffering of suffering, the suffering of change, and the suffering of the compounded. The last of these is not restricted to sentient beings and applies to all compounded, afflictive phenomena (everything other than path dharmas).

In this case, Metzinger's definition of suffering as a experience is too limited. By the criteria of the third kind of suffering, machines already suffer. My comment was directed to the idea that machines can experience suffering. But suffering is not only an experience in a consciousness, it is also an existential fact about impermanent phenomena.

We do not act collectively as Buddhists. We have different opinions on matters of Buddhist thought, let alone political thought.

Most Buddhist political parties historically have been extremely conservative and monarchist—which, from previous discussions here, is not necessarily the case with western Buddhists. So it is clear that there is not one political ideology that suits us collectively as Buddhists.

Unfortunately, people who get involved in politics with sincere intention are usually hoodwinked or taken advantage of by the corrupt participants (the same occurs in police forces).

Moreover, at the end of the day, politicians do not actually make policy, the civil service does. If you want to get involved in a real way, where you are involved in the actual process of drafting, limiting, and refusing or approving policies on a day to day basis, you should become a member of the civil service. They also ensure that policy does not actually change much, if at all, from one administration to another. Politicians, on the other hand, are a public face to government. Someone to blame. They use the three poisons in order to make people fear the consequences of choosing someone other than them.

There is no space father or mother, no rules, and no afterlife in which to receive a reward. The next life is not an "afterlife," it is the next life after this one, hopefully as a human being able to meet and practice the dharma.

AVOIDING THE TEN FAULTS

Master Padma said: When practicing the Dharma, you must make sure not to fall into the ten faults.

The lady asked: What are these ten faults?

The master said: Although you may practice meditation, if it does not become a remedy against your disturbing emotions and thoughts, you have the fault of the oral instructions not being made effective.

Although you may have recognized your mind, if it does not liberate your consciousness free from partiality, you have the fault of not having met with the special instruction.

Although you may have strong devotion, if you do not receive the blessings, you have the fault of not having connected with an accomplished master.

Although you may exert yourself with great effort, if your practice does not progress, you have the fault of your mind not being fully purified. 

If you feel tired when engaging in spiritual practice, you have the fault of not having recognized the natural state of awareness.

Although you practice, if your mind is still scattered, you have the fault of not having gained confidence in meditation. 

If experience does not arise directly in your state of mind, you have the fault of having only strayed into Samatha.

If the strength of awareness does not arise in your being, you have the fault of not knowing how to take appearances as aids to the path.

If you find it difficult to cut through your attachment to disturbing emotions, you have the fault of not knowing how to take the five poisons as the path.

If you cannot cope with suffering and difficulties, you have the fault of not knowing how to turn your mind away from samsãra. 

In any case, when you claim to practice the Dharma while being full of faults within is there any chance to ever have good circumstances?

US intelligence officials have no evidence confirming Navy pilot UFO encounters were alien spacecraft Washington (CNN)US intelligence officials have found no evidence confirming that unidentified flying objects encountered by US Navy pilots in recent years were alien spacecraft but also have not reached a definitive assessment as to what these mysterious objects might be, according to five sources familiar with the findings of an upcoming report on UFOs that is expected to be delivered to Congress later this month.

According to three of those sources, the report does not however rule out the possibility they are alien spacecraft.
While that uncertainty is likely a blow to the hopes of UFO enthusiasts who were hoping for definitive proof of extraterrestrial life, it does not minimize the significance of the report, especially given what sources describe as a years-long battle inside the Pentagon over whether even to acknowledge what are now hundreds of unexplained sightings by US military personnel.

The New York Times was first to publish details of the upcoming report.

US officials also cannot rule out the possibility that these flying objects were aircraft belonging to American adversaries, namely Russia and China -- a potentially more troublesome conclusion that raises a host of potential national security concerns, one of the sources said.

However, the forthcoming report is expected to conclude that the objects are not secret American technology, the source added.

In other words, if buddhahood arises from causes and conditions, it would be compounded and impermanent. One could realize buddhahood, and then when the conditions for buddhahood ceased, one's realization would vanish.

Queequeg said:
Yes. I agree with that.

In this view, buddhahood is total, and sentient beings are also buddhas, but afflicted.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, as taught in the Hevajra Tantra, and elsewhere.

Queequeg said:
The path, rather than being one of gradually accumulating merit and attaining buddhahood, as the Buddha who awoke at Gaya taught, is the shedding of afflictions, right?

In a sense, shedding is a mirror image of accumulating merit, but accumulating merit suggests that buddhahood is acquired. Shedding afflictions can in turn be gradual, as one might polish a raw diamond into a gem, by practicing repentance, observing precepts, etc., or sudden, by immediately entering the way, so to speak. The way I heard it explained in Dzogchen, for instance, is that we are introduced to this perfected state, and then practice is a matter of getting used to abiding in that view until we completely shed our shortcomings and limitations, and it is our default.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct. The recognition of the basis (while not considered fully qualified buddhahood in terms of expression) is the path, and the result is the full expression of the potential of that basis which emerges when even the afflictions themselves revert into gnosis.


Queequeg said:
This, is unintelligible for the Western Philosopher Man, cousin of Economic Man, and Reasonable Man. If you say Buddha is prime to them, in their categories it means something different than is meant in High Mahayana.

Malcolm wrote:
No one said it was easy. To decide that one knows what another person's capacity is supposes that one is clairvoyant. It is characteristic of the Dzogchen approach to start at the top and work one's way down until understanding dawns, in other words, start with the truth of cessation, not the truth of suffering.

In the Apoha and Yogachara view of the arising of perception we have imprints in our (alaya)consciousness, these imprints become activated when a sense-perception arrives through our sense-doors. The imprints are projected onto the perceptions, and we see these imprints as outer independent objects. We think that we see objective reality, which is not quite true, or not true at all.

Malcolm wrote:
In order for the beings of the six realms to see the same liquid substance as amṛta, water, etc., there has to be a liquid substance that exists separate from their perception of said substance.

One does not reject the existence of outer objects, one merely rejects the idea that outer objects exist inherently.

To bring it back around to the topic: It is certain that someone is seeing something. But whether that is some kind of extra-terrestrial phenomena or craft or some unexplained terrestrial phenomena or secret tech is unknown by anyone on this forum.

This primacy of the Buddha can be well understood through the metaphor of the sun and its light.

The Buddha is the sun. The Dharma is its light. However, while we cannot always see the light of the sun, the sun is always there.

Without the light shed by the sun, of course, those in ignorance cannot see things the way they are, and they stumble around in darkness. But the light of the sun depends on proper conditions to illuminate the world, even though the sun is always there, whether it is day or night.

This is why the Buddha has primacy. Without the sun of the Buddha rising in the sky, his light does not shine on the world. And due to the misfortune of sentient beings, the sun of the Buddha will also set, even though the Buddha never moves from his place, and does not rise or set.

Without the Buddha, there is no Dharma. And without the dharma, there is no Buddha. The Buddha became Buddha because of direct apprehension of Dharma. And then, Buddha is the expounder of the dharmas. Some traditions regard Guru is even superior then the Buddha in term of benefiting other. However, Dharma is more beneficial to me then the Buddha.

Buddha did not say, “If one sees Buddha, one will know the Dharma”. Or I might be ill-informed. Instead, he said, “If one sees the Dharma, one will see the Buddha.” Such statement might have shown the primacy of the Dharma. Or other might have different opinion for the same statement.
3. When this was said, Maitreya Bodhisattva-mahasattva spoke thus to the Venerable Sariputra: [Reverend Sariputra,] regarding what was said by the Lord, the master of Dharma, the omniscient:  "He monks who sees conditioned arising, sees Dharma, and he who sees Dharma, sees the Buddha. "

Salistamba Sutra
People regard Buddha is a majestic person having 32 major and 80 miner marks sitting in the throne and so forth. That is fine from certain perspective. Seeing the physical form of Buddha, no one has attained the enlightenment. But hearing and contemplating the dharmas many have attained enlightenment. When Buddha was consoling a bedridden monk, he said that there was nothing special about seeing his physical form. Seeing or realizing Pratītyasamutpāda (dependent arising) would be equivalent to seeing the Buddha. Dharma is more important and beneficial.

Malcolm wrote:
I doubt it is a sexist addition; it most certainly is a sexist sentiment.

As for tossing the whole sūtra out merely because it says some things that really must be taken with a grain of salt, no, that is not what I am implying.

Suppose the sūtra said, "Those who understand tathāgatagarbha are White, while those who do not understand tathāgatagarbha are Black. Now, if you are Black but you understand tathāgatagarbha, you are White; and if you are White and you do not understand tathāgatagarbha, you are Black."

Suppose the sūtra said, "Those who understand tathāgatagarbha are Eastern, while those who do not understand tathāgatagarbha are Western. Now, if you are Western but you understand tathāgatagarbha, you are Eastern; and if you are Eastern and you do not understand tathāgatagarbha, you are Western."

It is just a poorly thought out sentiment only possible in a patriarchal context where men are in a superior position (i.e. all of history).

So presumably even if a Sutra is provisional there is still a useful intent behind it. Which means, the question has not been answered in the slightest.

It is completely sexist. There is nothing useful, in this day and age, about gendering the appreciation of, or lack thereof, the tathāgatagarbha doctrine. The entire discussion in that passage devalues women.

In general, it should be considered provisional even by Longchenpa since it contains the doctrine of the icchantika. It is also considered provisional because it uses intentional language to discuss a self, permanence, and so on.

What Longchenpa holds to be definitive is the doctrine of tathāgatagarbha, but there are some problems if we take the whole of those ten sūtras to be "definitive."

Then of course, there is the issue of whether the tathāgatagarbha doctrine is actually definitive. Arguably, the Uttaratantra itself holds the tathāgatagarbha doctrine to be provisional.

If you know Nyoshül Khenpo's dris lan, he answers a precise question I asked him about that, long ago. Basically, his assumption is that it is not the case that in Dzogchen you reach the two resultant Kāyas without the two accumulations, but that the kadak aspect contains the accumulations of wisdom primordially perfected, while the lhundrup aspect contains the accumulations of merit originally perfected. Hence, he says, you obtain the Dharmakāya as the fruit of the (self-disclosing of?) kadak side of Rigpa and the Rūpakāya thanks to the (self-disclosing of?) the lhundrup side of Rigpa.

Being uncompounded, it cannot even be comprehended, unlike an abstract doctrine. Being effortless ("naturally perfected"), nobody has anything to do with it, unlike with a teaching. Being personally realised, one has to realise it for oneself and others cannot help, unlike with a teaching. The path that is demonstrated, that is the teaching, and it is through the path that afflictions are abandoned. So, taking refuge in the true buddha, the dharmakaya, means taking the ultimate truth (wisdom, dharma as reality) as shown in the teaching demonstrating reality (compassion, dharma as doctrine) and applying it, since there is actually nothing else to take refuge in.

Malcolm wrote:
The Dharma Gem arises from the Buddha Gem; at least according to Maitreyanātha. So again, it is the Buddha who is primary, because without the Buddha, there can be no Dharma, since the latter arises from the former, that is to say, the second set of qualities which benefit others arose from the first set of qualities which benefit oneself.

The Buddha is called the ultimate refuge for its permanence, thus actually meaning the dharma kaya.

Malcolm wrote:
The Uttaratantra states:

Buddha alone is a refuge 
because the Muni possesses the dharmakāya.

We agree that dharmakāya is termed permanent in this case. We also have to ask, what is buddhahood? The UT states six qualities:

Buddhahood that possesses two benefits
is uncompounded, naturally perfected,
is not realized through external conditions,
and possesses wisdom, love, and power.

It then continues:

[Buddhahood] is uncompounded because its primal nature 
is free from beginning, middle, and end.
Because [it] possesses the dharmakāya of pacification,
it is called "naturally perfected."
Because [buddhahood] is not realized through external conditions
it is personally realized.
As such, because those three aspects are realized, 
[buddhahood] is wisdom; 
because the path is demonstrated, the mind [of buddhahood] is loving,
and its power is abandoning all suffering and affliction
through gnosis and compassion.

Thus, what we are going for refuge in is the actual realization of a buddha, who has benefited themselves and is capable of benefitting us, and not some abstract doctrine we ourselves have not realized. Unlike the Dharma and the Sangha, it is uncompounded and permanent. Which is why the UT states unambiguously:

Because of being abandoned, because of being deceptive, 
because of nonexistence, and because of being fearful,
the two kinds of Dharma and the noble assembly
are not the supreme, permanent refuge.

Astus said:
In a similar fashion is Dharma itself described in the Pali Canon, that it is true and present regardless of a buddha arising or not arising

That, however, is not the dharmakāya as defined here.

Even the Buddha revered the Dharma as his teacher (SN 6.2). The Uttaratantra Shastra (3.21) calls the Buddha the ultimate refuge, it also practically combines all three into one, as Dzongsar JK Rinpoche commented: 'But ultimately, Buddha is not other than the Dharma and the Sangha, because the ultimate Dharma is the absence of attachment. And that’s what Buddha has achieved. And since Buddha is the result of end point of all the bhumis, the Buddha is also the essence, the quintessence of the Sangha.'

Malcolm wrote:
One, your reference to SN 6.2 is far too narrow, since in the Pali canon the Buddha has also declared in various places he had no teacher at all, and that he had teachers in past lives.

Second, no, the UT really doesn’t “practically combine all three refuges into one.” It points out that the Dharma and the Sangha are compounded and impermanent. This is the context in which Maitreya declares the Buddha to be the true refuge, Dzongsar’s apologetics notwithstanding.

This is the first English version of this religious classic tailored to the essential Buddhist practice of daily sutra recitation."

Have you seen an actual copy of this?

Regarding the one over at 84000, I don't doubt its good, but I'd like a physical copy, and if its made for recitation, that would be pretty cool.

Malcolm wrote:
I am pretty sure Vimalamkīrti beat Nichiren to the punch:

Thereupon, magically influenced by the Buddha, the venerable Śāriputra
had this thought: “If the buddhafield is pure only to the extent that the mind
of the bodhisattva is pure, [F.180.b] then, when Śākyamuni Buddha was
engaged in the career of the bodhisattva, his mind must have been impure.
Otherwise, how could this buddhafield appear to be so impure?”

The Buddha, aware of venerable Śāriputra’s thoughts, said to him, “What
do you think, Śāriputra? Is it because the sun and moon are impure that
those blind from birth do not see them?”

Śāriputra replied, “No, Lord. It is not so. The fault lies with those blind
from birth, and not with the sun and moon.”

The Buddha declared, “In the same way, Śāriputra, the fact that some
living beings do not behold the splendid display of virtues of the
buddhafield of the Tathāgata is due to their own ignorance. It is not the fault
of the Tathāgata. Śāriputra, the buddhafield of the Tathāgata is pure, but you
do not see it.”

Then, the Brahmā Śikhin said to the venerable Śāriputra, “Reverend
Śāriputra, do not say that the buddhafield of the Tathāgata is impure.
Reverend Śāriputra, the buddhafield of the Tathāgata is pure. I see the
splendid expanse of the buddhafield of the Lord Śākyamuni as equal to the
splendor of, for example, the abodes of the highest deities.”

Then the venerable Śāriputra said to the Brahmā Śikhin, “As for me, O
Brahmā, I see this great earth, with its highs and lows, its thorns, its
precipices, its peaks, and its abysses, as if it were entirely filled with ordure.”
Brahmā Śikhin replied, “The fact that you see such a buddhafield as this as
if it were so impure, reverend Śāriputra, is a sure sign that there are highs
and lows in your mind and that your positive thought in regard to the
buddha-gnosis is not pure either. Reverend Śāriputra, those whose minds
are impartial toward all living beings and whose positive thoughts toward
the buddha-gnosis are pure see this buddhafield as perfectly pure.” [F.181.a]

Thereupon the Lord touched the ground of this billion-world galactic
universe with his big toe, and suddenly it was transformed into a huge mass
of precious jewels, a magnificent array of many hundreds of thousands of
clusters of precious gems, until it resembled the universe of the Tathāgata
Ratnavyūha, called Ananta guṇa ratna vyūha. Everyone in the entire assembly
was filled with wonder, each perceiving himself seated on a throne of
jeweled lotuses.

As a practical matter, I have found that when I try to share my interests in meditation and lucid dreaming and mindfulness with others that they quickly realize I'm not getting the results for myself. They always end up deciding they don't have time for such things. And materially speaking I'm a complete failure. I'm lucky to have any money five days after payday. But being in the Mahayana seems to be about helping others to reach the other shore and the first of the Paramitas is Dana. As a practical matter how do you give what you don't have? People do tend to notice, and they don't tend to be very receptive to it.

In many respects it reads like a text book (which it is), and is not the most thrilling writing ever, but each chapter has an extensive bibliography, and authors take pain not to retread old material, but focus on the social dimension of Japanese Buddhist history, its not a book about the various schools as much as it is a book about how Japanese society and Buddhism evolved together from the beginnings of Buddhism's introduction by Korean merchants, and so on.

I will add, that one thing of interest to me is the parallel developments of Buddhism on opposite ends of Asia, in Tibet and Japan (While I was never interested in Chinese or Korean Buddhism per se, I was interested in Japanese Buddhism first, and then later, Tibetan Buddhism.)

Japan's economy and society was not notably disrupted by the Great Buddhist Purge of 845 in China, which threw all of mainland Asia into social and economic disarray. While Buddhism was present in Tibet in some form or another since roughly the 5th century CE, when a copy of the Karandavyhua was supposedly presented to King Lhato Thori(27th king of Tibet), and Tibetans were certainly aware of Buddhism since they regularly sacked Khotan (there is a whole sūtra about this), Buddhism did not begin to be formally established until the 7th century, during the reign of King Songtsan Gampo (?-649, he was reputed to have lived 82 years, but info is sketchy, his reign was from 629-649). So given the implied dates of his life span, he was a contemporary of Shotoku.

Interestingly enough, it is quite likely that this planted to the seed of the Avalokiteśvara Devotion in Tibet.

Queequeg said:
Buddhologists have dated various texts in the Buddhist canon based on when they appeared in places outside of the Indian sphere. For instance, the age of many Mahayana texts are estimated based on when they appeared in China. One could also glean some insight about the form of Buddhism in India at particular times based on the type of Buddhism that was transmitted to other places. For instance - the transmission of Vajrayana to China is  occurred in the 7th to 8th centuries, while the transmission to Tibet occurred from the 8th - 11th c. (?). The Vajrayana that was transmitted to China corresponds to early Indian Vajrayana, while Tibet receive those as well as later forms.

Malcolm had observed that the popularity of the Lotus Sutra in Japan seems due to its introduction from the start, and that the popularity of Avalokitesvara may be due to his early introduction in Tibet. Earlier in the discussion he had noted sort of similar dynamics of tension of popular and institutional Buddhisms in the two countries, but how this played out under different conditons.

I'm interested to explore these ideas a little more. Not sure how the discussion will go, but just putting these observations as an open invitation to comment.

I'm interested to see how the same ideas may have played out differently because of different social and political conditions. Also interested in parallel developments - things that played out similarly.

Sorry that might not be pointed enough to kick off the discussion. I'll maybe try again if this is just a dud.

It was hard to watch from the outside - from bodies piling up in NYC to police killing black men in cold blood to the batsh*t crazy election and the storming of Capital Hill by white nationalists.

Of course, none of these threads are all suddenly resolved, but it looks from the outside like things have taken a massive turn for the better. Good vaccination rates, a sane leader etc.

Queequeg said:
Yes. I believe the Lotus, Golden Light (Suvarnaprabhasa), and the Benevolent Kings Sutras were the first Buddhist texts given to the Emperor by the King of Baekje (sp?), along with a statue of the Buddha and several monks and nuns. From there, it was promoted by the periodic recitation at the network of national temples that had been set up in all the provinces. Then later when the Tiantai lineage was brought back from China by Saicho, the Lotus was framed as a sutra for the protection of the nation anew, this time from Mt. Hiei which is located NE of Kyoto, to protect from evil spirits that were said to come from that direction.

Malcolm wrote:
This is interesting, in that it suggests the LS was already at the center of a populist Buddhist movement in Japan quite early:

Queequeg said:
Meanwhile, undoubtedly in part in connection with the patronage of the Tendai lineages by the Northern Fujiwara House, the Lotus Sūtra was the central object of veneration and more general ritual concern at court. The Lotus Sūtra was already prominently featured in the Sanbō’e, which included a discussion of the Eight Lotus Sūtra Lectures Assembly at Kumano. It is important here to emphasize that it mentioned the presence not only of lay aristocrats at the assembly but also of “monks” in “deer skin,” which suggests the presence of mountain ascetics (shugenja), who might be connected to the category of ambiguous religious practitioners called “holy ones” (hijiri), discussed in the next section. Indeed, faith in the Lotus Sūtra was clearly now not limited to the aristocracy since it had been disseminated to other groups in the populace. For example, the tales in the collection Honchō hokke genki (hereafter Hokke genki; Accounts of Lotus Sūtra Anomalies in Japan) (ca. 1041–1044) depict such anomalies from the standpoint of the so-called “Lotus [Sūtra] holy ones” (Hokke hijiri or jikyōja), which makes it clear that such faith spread across classes over the course of the mid Heian period onwards.6 Indeed, these figures deployed rhetoric of the Lotus Sūtra to legitimate their position within the evolving Buddhist communities of their day (Deal 1993: 267–268).

However it undermines the notion Nichiren was the initiator of such sentiments, or that Nichiren was a unique working class hero of the Lotus sutra struggling in an unprecedented confrontation with Buddhist elites.

There was a discussion with respect to Dagri Rinpoche about that. The Bhikkhunīs investigating the subject matter found out: if you as the vow taker fully believed in the preceptor being properly ordained and holding the vows, your ordination is valid. They had sources for this. I have to check my emails for the details. If HH Karmapa conferred ordination or participated in ordination rituals I don’t know the slightest.

Malcolm wrote:
Generally, the order actually given in the sūtras is as follows, for example, in the Ugraparipṛcchā, Ratnarāśi, etc.: "Rely on the meaning, not on the syllables; rely on gnosis (jñāna), not on consciousness (vijñāna); rely on the dharma, not on the person; rely on sūtras of definitive meaning, not on sūtras of provisional meaning."

Then of course this leave open the question, "what is a definitive sūtra?" The Buddha defines this in many ways. For example, in the Bodhisattvapiṭaka he defines a definitive sūtra as one that explains the meaning comprehensively and that introduces the result. Repeating those criteria, the Aksayamati Sūtra expands the list by pointing out that provisional sūtras teach on self, persons, living beings, etc.; those sūtras that teach emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, nonfabrication, nonorigination, nonproduction, absence of entities, selflessness, and so on are definitive. The Anavataptanāgarāja Sutra teachings us that sūtras which teach dependent origination are definitive sūtras, because that which arises in dependence is selfless, etc.

Thus, there are many definitive sūtras, not only one or two.

The sense of 'searching for blame' in the confusion somewhere in his early experiences, the statement that he would 'like to start from the beginning again'; to have perfect vows before death; in that context it makes this talk seem like hidden messages he can't state outright.

If we conclude that he no longer has vows, and is 'starting again' and that he also took getsul vows with HHDL, as Tenzin says, then what is in between is breaking them.

And Malcolm, to which school do your 'Bhikshus' belong and with what reasoning do they say the Karmapa is 'not a monk or a novice monk'? This does leave the last category of 'intermediate' ordination.

"Bar ma rab 'byung" (*madhyapravrajita) is a Tibetan invention, common in all Tibetan monastic institutes, but still a Tibetan idea. You will not find that term in Vinaya itself.

There are only eight kinds of pratimokṣa vows: upāsaka, upavasa, śramanera, bhikṣu + their equivalents for women. The śikṣamāṇā probationary period for women is not really considered a separate vow. Also, there is no celibate upāsaka vow in Mulasarvastivada.

However, Japan, unlike Tibet, was a highly organized society where central authorities were much more present in daily life. With Tibet, you had nomads, bandits, and people pretty much doing as they pleased in areas outside of immediate urban centers and great monastic institutions.

In this sort of Japanese environment, it is easy to see how Buddhism became stratified, and why, in the 13th century, populist forms of Buddhism arose. Actually, my read of Dogen, based on recent reading, was that he was engaged in an idiosyncratic pushback against the populism that exemplified Pure Land and Nichiren, as well as a reform movement aimed at introducing 13th century, Chinese style monastic Chan Buddhism into Japan.

In Tibet, exactly the opposite was happening—there was major institutional pushback against Buddhist populism, especially against the treasure tradition. Also, Mongols were invading... (Dogen also took credit for repelling the Mongols, BTW.)

Not really. When one sees multiple tulkus of one person, its usually because different lineage heads of different monasteries recognize a tulku of that person. It is not an organized institution with the central clearing house of incarnations. It is pretty much a free for all, and competition among the backers of competing tulkus can be quite fierce and even descent into all out war, like in the present day Karmapa affair.

Emanations of high level bodhisattvas don't need to recognized and enthroned. The days of tulkus are numbered.

Bla bla bla. They have mind, body and speech emanations. The lineage is what matters not some interesting innovations from Massachusetts.  The teaching is that buddhas can emanate countless ways. If someone is an emanation of so and so depends if their actions resemble so and so. Malcolm mocks this but professes Buddha was a cartoon.  It's better to think in pragmatic terms.

And your observation about Nichiren Buddhism scholarship sounds right. I don't think anyone in the West has dug much deeper than to look at the subject from a historical perspective. The investigations of the teachings themselves have only been scratching the surface. I suspect there is a lot more vajrayana integrated into his teachings. The problem in the West is the investigation is not that deep. In Japan, the scholars tend to be sectarians who take Nichiren's criticisms of Shingon at face value and so can't bring themselves to consider that Vajrayana is at play. I brought up Lucia Dolce's study suggesting the influence of Vajrayana to some Japanese Nichiren scholars and they reacted very negatively. I was actually surprised at their response.

Tenpel said:
I agree with the honesty - which is a hall mark of his qualities IMO.

However, I strongly feel, Malcom is reframing the whole issue and though he knows so much, he misses here the point - maybe because he is not really familiar with the Vinaya or didn’t receive commentaries on it.

First of all, renunciation is something to be developed and not there from the start for most people when they ordain. Though renunciation is the best motivation, it’s not the decisive principle of receiving the vows; or having received the vows (or not having received them). As I said, mundane motivations are also permissible say the commentaries - e.g. protection from fear or protection from hunger (when I remember the oral Vinaya commentaries I received correctly, it were these two.) It’s recommended at least before ordination to generate a type of artificial renunciation. But this is not the decisive principle. Nobody is expected to have, or to take ordination with a fully fledged renunciation. Not having pure renunciation when taking the vows or after having received the vows does not make them invalid. The vows are been produced by requesting them and receiving them, the proper ritual, and this has been the case here, he requested them and he received them, and it was a proper ritual. You can read details about the coming into existence of vows also in the Abhidharmas or Jangon Kongtrul’s Boom 5 on Ethics. For the ritual see also the 84.000 website.

Now, with respect to intention. Sorry, it’s a lame excuse to say he / I didn’t have the intention to receive the novice vows when going to the ordination ceremony. Why? With respect to intention there is “causal motivation” and “time motivation” - according to the Abhidharma. So, if he didn’t have the causal motivation to take the novice vows when he went to the ordination ceremony, then he has had the time motivation when asking three times for the novice ordination during the ritual. Hence, he had the motivation at the time of receiving the vows. It is similar to having the causal motivation not wanting to kill the mosquito but finding it unbearable then when the mosquito is too much irritating, killing it. It’s the fully fledged act of killing. Or not wanting to give to beggars but being overwhelmed by the sufferings of a beggar, out of strong compassion or empathy giving him alms. It’s a fully fledged act of giving. Or not wanting to engage in sexual activities because you took the vow of celibacy but being overwhelmed by sexual desire, engaging in sexual activity through one of the three doors at the time of an opportunity. It’s the fully fledged act of having broken your vow of celibacy. You cannot escape this fact of having done the act by saying “but I didn’t have the intention to have sex.” You didn’t have the intention initially (causal motivation) but you had it at the time of the act (time motivation).

Moreover, it would be rather a matter to discuss this with your abbot than speculating freely but with many doubts about it, without having clarity - as it seems.

And then there is another problem here, not being a monk but collecting money or receiving alms as a monk. There is no statement whatsoever on the website or awareness in the public or any type of clear statement that he is not a monk anymore but there is a statement on his official website that he is ordained and received the getsul vows. Receiving alms as a monk without being it is extremely negative karma.

For the time being, to settle the topic hopefully, the official website itself states that the Karmapa received ordination as a getsul and it was especially auspicious to have received it by the Dalai Lama:

“On July 24, the 15th day of the 6th Tibetan month, His Holiness the Gyalwang Karmapa received his ordination as a novice monk (dge tshul pha) from His Holiness the Dalai Lama, who was assisted at the ceremony by His Eminence Gyaltsab Rinpoche. This joyous occasion was marked by three days of celebration at Gyuto Monastery. It is considered particularly auspicious that His Holiness was able to receive his Getsul vows from the Dalai Lama. After the Karmapa received his vows, His Holiness the Dalai Lama conferred novice and final ordination on some 800 monks from southern India.”

Popularly known as the Lotus Sūtra, this is one of the most revered Mahāyāna sūtras in the history of Buddhism. Devotion to it as being superior to all other sūtras has, in China, Korea, and Japan, created traditions based solely upon this sūtra. The Japanese chant Namu myōhō renge kyō (南無妙法蓮華經 “Homage to the White Lotus of the Good Dharma Sūtra”) has become the primary practice of tens of thousands of so-called Buddhists around the world. The mere existence of this sūtra must have brought millions of people into the Dharma and done much to ensure devotion to Buddhism and patronage of it over millennia.
pf.­4

We should rejoice in this. But we should also be mindful that rigid attachment to the letter‍—rather than the spirit‍—of this sūtra has led to some misunderstanding and discord among Buddhists. And that is not a good thing. For example, the Lotus Sūtra has been wrongly invoked to justify gender bias, material grasping, and even self-immolation and militant proselytizing. So it is most important to read and study this profound sūtra with a proper understanding of its underlying meaning and spirit.
pf.­5

In the evolution of humankind, we have constantly strengthened our capacity to think and communicate in ways that not only convey information, but also create imagined worlds. It was this ability to forge common myths, imagined orders, and hierarchies that enabled us humans to cooperate in larger numbers than ever before, leading us to evolve from being hunter-gatherers to settling in small agrarian communities, and then in towns and cities. Over the centuries, we have come to believe more and more in the imagined realities of corporations, nations, and hierarchies.
pf.­6

We Buddhists are not immune to these belief systems. For example, Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna Buddhists have evolved their own entrenched hierarchies that often look down on the Śrāvakayāna. Even the often-used term “Hīnayāna” can be used by Mahāyānists in a derogatory and chauvinist way to look down on the śrāvakas. This is really very important to note here because the Lotus Sūtra has been misused time and time again by such chauvinists to justify and entrench their feeling of superiority.

But here in the Lotus Sūtra, the Buddha actually says:
pf.­7

“I teach many dharmas in the world
So that here and there I bring liberation from attachment.
I give the teaching of the three yānas,
Which is my supreme skill in methods.” (2.­25)

pf.­8

If one is a supreme being, if one has mastered the dexterity of skillful means to address the variety of people in the world, one is able to skillfully teach different methods or “yānas” to suit the characteristics and affinities of people who are naturally inclined to different proclivities. The Buddha continues, saying:
pf.­9

“Apart from the skillful methods of supreme beings
Who give the teaching of separate yānas,
There is only one yāna; there is no second,
And there is never in the world a third.” (2.­81)

pf.­10

This, to me, suggests that, apart from the supreme beings who have the capacity to differentiate yānas without categorizing them into hierarchies, for each of us more lowly beings there is only the yāna we are taught and that we should be practicing. This emphasizes the importance of the role of the teacher who gives us the practices suited to our own situation. It is merely our own egos and minds that search for reference points, make judgments, and habitually create these hierarchies. So, it may help to remember that no matter what we understand in this sūtra, the Buddha says:
pf.­11

“A lord of the world appears in the world
In order to teach the wisdom of buddhahood.
That is his one activity, there is no second:
The buddhas do not guide beings with a lesser yāna.” (2.­82)

pf.­12

We must always remember that a tathāgata “appears in this world for that one deed and one action, for that one great deed and great action, and with that intention.” A tathāgatha does not discriminate between beings, nor judge the yānas that are taught to them or by them. Remember, the Buddha is also known as the Tathāgata, and also has many more names, including Arhat, the Tibetan of which literally translates as a “foe-destroyer.” But in his case, foes were not people. They were his emotions and his habit of clinging to his ego, which he overcame. Throughout his previous one thousand lifetimes as a bodhisattva, the only things the Tathāgata ever destroyed were his emotions and his ego; he never once harmed a single being.
pf.­13

And so, when we talk about the motivation of tathāgatas to appear in this world, we must remember that, like the Buddha, they have as their only intention and motivation the enlightenment of others. As a buddha, the Tathāgata possesses “supreme skill in methods” and teaches according to “the various aspirations, natures, and thoughts of beings.” In a way, we can say that the Dharma teachings one receives are like bespoke suiting: a tall, lanky man and a round, jolly one could be wearing the same suit, made of the same cloth, and the same thread, but with the skill of an experienced tailor, they are fitted‍—bespoke‍—for the individual. From afar, passers-by would say these two men are wearing the same suit, because the end result is that both are wrapped in the same cloth and both look good in it, but the methods used, the size of the patterns, and the particular cut might have been very different. Similarly, the ways in which the Dharma is taught are meant to be similarly bespoke. The Buddha says:
pf.­14

“I teach the Dharma by using a variety of teachings on accomplishment, and various teachings on causes, reasons, parables, supports, and skillful methods.” (2.­59)

The idea is that whatever method‍—or whichever yāna‍—is taught to a particular being, that method is the one that will most efficiently awaken that being. In that sense, this idea of a hierarchy is no longer as real as we think.
pf.­15

It is really this idea of skillful means that is so important in this sūtra, and that can help us to appreciate all yānas. The Tibetan for skillful methods is thabs (Skt. upāya). The word thabs brings with it the connotation of a “trick”‍—or even a “catalyst,” because skillful methods speed things up without affecting the elements involved.

Given all this, are cryptocurrencies headed for a crash sometime soon? Not necessarily. One fact that gives even crypto skeptics like me pause is the durability of gold as a highly valued asset. Gold, after all, suffers from pretty much the same problems as Bitcoin. People may think of it as money, but it lacks any attributes of a useful currency: You can’t actually use it to make transactions — try buying a new car with gold ingots — and its purchasing power has been extremely unstable.

Alex Berzin's take on this:

Dharma-Lite Versus the Real Thing Dharma
Dr. Alexander Berzin

Most Westerners approach Buddhism without belief in reincarnation or rebirth; however, traditional Buddhism assumes the existence of beginningless rebirth. “Dharma-Lite” is a way to practice Buddhism purely for improving this lifetime, without the concept of rebirth. When practiced as a steppingstone for “The Real Thing” Dharma (traditional Buddhism complete with the assertion of rebirth), Dharma-Lite is the stage best suited for most Westerners to begin with.

From my reading, Berzin uses "Dharma-lite" specifically to identify an interest only in securing happiness in this life, a sort of "remedial" stage in the Lam-rim teachings before you even really enter it meaningfully. It's a part of explaining Lam-rim to Western Dharma students according to a gradual path.

Using various methods, the student then engages in various practices to encounter their own state until they have decided upon it, decide one thing, or as CHNN puts, remain without doubt.

Then one continues in that state, or literally, continue in the confidence of liberation, meaning one is now a real dzogchen practitioner.

One is simply as a set of guidelines for daily living. These are what you find in the coffee-table books featuring the Dalai Lama, or books on mindfulness by Thich Nhat Hanh.

Anybody who follows any religion can apply these Dharma teachings, just as one can apply the sayings of Confucius, the aphorisms of Ben Franklin, or the teachings on forgiveness by Jesus.

In the Tibetan tradition this is called "mi chos," which corresponds more or less to our idea of secular ethics.

And there they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self-luminous, moving through the air, glorious — and they stay like that for a very long time. But sooner or later, after a very long period, this world begins to expand again. At a time of expansion, the beings from the Abhassara Brahma world, [85] having passed away from there, are mostly reborn in this world. Here they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self- luminous, moving through the air, glorious--and they stay like that for a very long time.
11. 'At that period, Vasettha, there was just one mass of water, and all was darkness, blinding darkness. Neither moon nor sun appeared, no constellations or stars appeared, night and day were not distinguished, nor months and fortnights, no years or seasons, and no male and female, beings being reckoned just as beings. And sooner or later, after a very long period of time, savoury earth spread itself over the waters where those beings were. It looked just like the skin that forms itself over hot milk as it cools. It was endowed with colour, smell and taste. It was the colour of fine ghee or butter, and it was very sweet, like pure wild honey.
12. 'Then some being of a greedy nature said: "I say, what can this be?" and tasted the savoury earth on its finger. In so doing, it became taken with the flavour, and craving arose in it. Then other beings, taking their cue from that one, also tasted the stuff with their fingers. They too were taken with the flavour, and craving arose in them. So they set to with their hands, breaking off pieces of the stuff in order to eat it. And [86] the result of this was that their self-luminance disappeared. And as a result of the disappearance of their self-luminance, the moon and the sun appeared, night and day were distinguished, months and fortnights appeared, and the year and its seasons. To that extent the world re-evolved.

“Moreover, Mañjuśrī, bodhisattva mahāsattvas see the emptiness of all
phenomena —phenomena as they are, not as they are not —as they truly are,
unwavering, unshakeable, immutable, unchanging, always as they truly are,
having the nature of space, beyond definition and terminology, unborn,
neither existing nor not existing, not composite, not continuous, spoken of
through the word nonexistence, in an unimpeded state, and manifested from

Taken at face value, it makes no sense in formal logic. Gee, maybe it is not meant to be a logical proposition. Maybe, just maybe, the fourfold negation by Nāgārjuna actually represent positions his contemporaries held.

There are four possible states proposed in Ancient India for any given thing. It exists. It does not exist. It both exists and does not exist. It neither exists nor does not exist. Nāgārjuna, etc., are refuting these four possibilities because they contradict dependent origination.

Likewise, Dzogchen "logic" similarly does not really depart from Nāgārjuna in this case. Dzogchen negates the positions of others without advancing its own position. Dzogchen, like "Prasangika," has no position of its own.

As Rongzom points out, Dzogchen cannot be negated through logic, nor can it be proven through logic.

There are really only 3 basic positions that I personally know of. What I'm saying is not so much a philosophical description (there might exist many more detailed philosophical descriptions) but rather an empirical, i.e. based on what you actually "perceive" during mind training.

In the Therevada schools mind events arise in succession, i.e. they are discrete and there is no continuity among them. Each mind moment has its own consciousness. The idea of a "stream" is imputed in retrospective, as has been pointed out above.

In certain Hindu schools such as Patanjali Yogasutras mind itself is a continuum only, i.e. one single "amorphous mind mass" continuously transmorphing into just the next form. Here, it cannot be said that the mind holds a single object at a time, because according to this view there really are no distinct mind moments holding objects at all. It's one single, eternal, ever changing mind moment, with one single ever-changing object, so to say. (Needless to say that Buddhist practitioners typically are not familiar with corresponding meditative practices and would reject this view, as it is exclusively "Hindu".)

Malcolm wrote:
Purusha is eternal and static. Prakriti undergoes transformations but not Purusha—it is a passive, eternal witness and when one attains kaivalya one no longer bothers with prakrit's transformations.

fckw said:
What both the Therevada Vipassana and Patanjali Yogasutra system of practice have in common is that neither has practices to reach beyond time and space.

In the dzogchen/mahamudra school the practice goes beyond time (and space), so to say. Therefore, the idea of a succession in the sense of a stream of mind moments or one "mind mass transmorphing continuously" does not apply. Mind moments, as they arise, can by definition not be in succession.

Malcolm wrote:
Also not true. Dzogchen does not negate momentariness, for example in the Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra:

When there is no movement in the mind,
the essence of a single moment of consciousness
is said to be momentarily without concepts.

Or the commentary on the Tantra Without Syllables:

Since those appearances were recognized as one’s own appearances,
(1) there are no stages and paths to traverse, (2) there is no accomplishment
through effort, and (3) [those appearances] revert automatically in
three moments into the original basis.

Or the commentary on the Blazing Lamp:

...after a person of the highest capacity exhausts the vāyu of the karma of concepts,
the first bardo is made a momentary object, and [94b] one attains buddhahood in three moments.

Malcolm wrote:
They do not belong to a person, also "person" is just a nominal designation applied to the aggregates.

An individual's aggregates are individual because the addictive aggregates (upadana skandhas) are appropriated by an afflicted consciousness under the delusion of a self. When that consciousness is free from delusion of a self, it ceases to appropriate aggregates because they are no longer addictive. For example, when the urge to smoke tobacco ceases, tobacco is no longer addictive.

The purpose of the teaching of the five aggregates is to show that there is no self, since no self can be found in any one of the aggregates, in all of them together, or separate from them.

If you wish to truly understand Buddhadharma, you should begin with Abhidharma, and study it with proper guidance.

This would seem to explain why the various traditions have different means for understanding and measuring anatta.

In Shobogenzo Zuimonki, he acknowledged that many people believed in the age of the Last Dharma, saying, “Many people in the secular world say, ‘Although I have aspiration to study the Way, the world is in the age of the Last Dharma. People’s quality has been declining and I have only inferior capabilities. I cannot bear to practice being in accordance with the Dharma. I would like to follow an easier way which is suitable to me, to just make a connection [with the Buddha], and expect to attain realization in a future lifetime.’”

And Dogen expressed his counter-argument:

“Now, I say that this saying is totally wrong. In the Buddha Dharma, distinguishing the three periods of time — the age of True Dharma, Semblance Dharma, and Last Dharma — is only a temporary expedient. The genuine teaching of the Way is not like this. When we practice [following the teaching], all of us should be able to attain [the Way]. Monks while [Shakyamuni] was alive were not necessarily superior. There were some monks who had incredibly despicable minds and who were inferior in capacity. The Buddha set forth various kinds of precepts for the sake of bad people and inferior people. Each and every human being has the possibility [to clarify] the Dharma. Do not think that you are not a vessel. When we practice in accordance [with the Dharma], all of us should be able to attain [the Way]. Since we already have a mind, we can distinguish between good and bad. Since we have hands and feet, we don’t lack anything for doing gassho and walking. In practicing the Buddha Dharma, we should not be concerned with the quality [of people]. All beings within the human realm are all vessels [of the Buddha Dharma].
