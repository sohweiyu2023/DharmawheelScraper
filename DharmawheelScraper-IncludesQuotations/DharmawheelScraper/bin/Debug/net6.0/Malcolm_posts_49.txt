The Buddhist teaching that the mind is by nature radiant is a very wholesome notion in working with suffering.

When the mind is attended to directly with mindfulness, one touches the natural radiance, and when one clears away the mental hindrances and other defilements, the mind shine radiantly again.
This not only a dhyānic radiance.

As the sutta itself says, consciousness ceases. Adding in brackets "activity of" means little, since a non-active consciousness is just unconsciousness.

See my previous comment. Although it can be said that since there is no attachment, it doesn't rely on anything, doesn't identify with anything, so in a way it is as you say. My problem is that when it is said there is an "unconditioned consciousness", because consciousness means knowing and thinking, and there can be no knowing and thinking without causes and conditions, it is a contradiction.

Malcolm wrote:
It is a contradiction only if one has stubborn clinging things as real. But we already know that causes and conditions are completely unreal, so why get stuck on a consciousness being unconditioned? In reality, there are no conditioned phenomena because cause and conditions are not established, having never arisen from the beginning. If you claim it is merely an essence of phenomena that have not arisen, this means you grasp to the conventional as real. This comes from not understanding homogeneity and nonduality.

Astus said:
So what isn't a theory?
That's a valid question. The difference here is that while normally it is easy to identify the first six consciousnesses, and that's what one works with, the 7th and 8th are not seen nor used for anything, except for theorising about karma.

Malcolm wrote:
That is really not true at all. For example, what takes rebirth in the yogacara system is precisely the ālayavijñāna.

No, the basis of the "conventional" is delusion. Cause and condition cannot be established apart from delusion, they are rooted in delusion, and therefore, the basis of the conventional is also delusion.
The delusion in conventional is to take it for the absolute. When conventional is seen as conventional, there is no problem, so it is then the absolute. In other words, conventional is not negated but enlightened. But, again, we can say that there is either deluded functions and buddha functions, and the two never meet. However, I consider that model more misleading.

Malcolm wrote:

Further, the Kāśyapa-parivarta Sūtra states:
"Permanent," that is one extreme;"impermanent," that is another extreme. Whatever is the middle of those two cannot be investigated.
Sthiramati's comment on how this is understood is instructive:
If it is asked what is an extreme, the extreme of the tirthikas is grasping at a self. That is grasped as permanent, reifying the aggregates, sense bases and elements..."'Permanent,' that is the first extreme..." means "self, that is the first extreme." 

The śravakas and pratyekabuddhas grasp the aggregates and so on as impermanent and grasp them as selfless..."'Impermanent,' that is the second extreme..." means "selfless, that is the second extreme." 

"Whatever is the middle of those two, that is..." means that is nonconceptual pristine consciousness. Because that cannot be analyzed, it cannot be investigated.
Something [nonconceptual pristine consciousness] which is neither permanent nor impermanent can hardly be called conditioned. It also cannot be called something that arises from cause and conditions. Nonconceptual pristine consciousness is by definition beyond the range of conventional analysis and can only be discovered for oneself.

While it was Dogen who made that interpretation one of the main elements of his teachings, as he shows by a number of quotations, the common reification of buddha-nature has been pointed out by teachers before him as well.

As I see it, the dual qualities of emptiness-awareness can be applied perfectly well to the five aggregates, in the sense that they are without essence, and at the same time exist as experiences. But assuming that there is something beyond, an eternal knower, is just a self-view.

Malcolm wrote:
You have not grasped the point. The notion of conditioned/unconditioned depend on reification. They depend on the notion of time and entities being real.

When you insist that emptiness is only the emptiness of dependently origination things, this is wrong on two counts. Dependent origination was never taught to explain the nature of things. It was taught only explain the process of delusion and how to reverse it. Second, there are no "things" for which dependent origination is the nature.

Since the conditioned is not established, it goes without saying that the unconditioned is not established.

However, since the eight consciousness are strictly deluded, there can be no buddhahood in them. Since pristine consciousness is free from conditions, time, entities, concepts and so on, only in it can buddhahood be found. When it is said that self-originated pristine consciousness is unconditioned and beyond the eight consciousness, this means that one has realized that there is also no basis for dependent origination nor the conditioned, not to mention the unconditioned. The real meaning of dependent origination is nonorigination. There can be no time, conditions, causes, etc., in a real sense. This is why there is no buddhahood in the mind because the mind [citta] is always conceptual, always bound causes, conditions, time, etc.

Therefore, the original mind is dharmatā emptiness, the luminous mind that does not become solely empty by nature or an inert emptiness and is called self-originated pristine consciousness. Since there isn’t an iota of a characteristic of conditioned or unconditioned apart from being intrinsically clear emptiness, it [original mind] is beyond the inert composed of particles, clarity which possesses subject and object, and a knowing consciousness. It is to be realized with personal knowledge that sees the true state. It has no correlation with the group of eight consciousnesses. Since the apprehending subject and apprehended objects of concepts and signs have never existed in the dharmatā of the union of knowing and emptiness, the signs of dualistic phenomena such as samsara and nirvana, delusion and liberation, self and other, beginning and end, and so on, have never existed in it since it naturally abide in uniform nonconceptuality.

Mental discernment (manovijñāpti) is the reason for discerning that the eye and so forth encounter phenomena. The discernment of mental consciousness possesses a view. Mental consciousness is conceptual because discernment generates all appearances.
The problem is, that aside from the five sense organ consciousness, all the three others can be described as conceptual consciousnesses, which still makes your presentation from Living Yogacara illsuited. The Mahāyānasamgraha states:
The the concept of the foundation is the all-basis consciousness.

Since the fundamental concept is "imputation," it is defined as the foundation of concepts, that is also the all-basis consciousness.

I didn't mention it. The sūtras maintain this is so. They also maintain that dharmakāya is jñāna. Draw your own conclusions.

Astus said:
Unconditioned knowing is not possible, unless one accepts a soul. So, the meaning is something else.
Mano-vijn̄āna is a nonconceptual consciousness, like the other five sense consciousnesses.
The mano-vijnana is the thinking mind, the one with all the thoughts and ideas, i.e. concepts. It is also the one that becomes discerning wisdom (pratyavekṣaṇājñāna / 妙觀察智). So, what you seem to be saying is that conceptuality is non-conceptual. Manas only adds the grasping at self, and a number of basic defilements.

The first mind as subjective transformer is the ālaya-vijñāna. The ālayavijñāna flawlessly retains all of our past experiences, and recognizes and contextualizes things as we cognize them. our experiences, according to their depth and significance upon our lives, are difficult to remove.
The second subjective transformer is the manas. in this case, objects of cognition are transformed by a deep attachment to the self, and the resulting tendencies to protect and further that self.
Then, already subject to these subconscious influences, the cognitive function of the thinking consciousness and the five sense consciousnesses—that is, the discrimination of things — arises.

PTSD, etc., this is a completely different issue. But here we are talking about neurological damage to nerve pathways caused by excess stress in combat, accidents, repeated abuse, and while it is the case that we see that kind of damage from cocaine, methamphetamine, and so on, so far no one has ever demonstrated any neurological damage resulting from using LSD, Psilocybin, Mescaline, DMT, etc. Part of the problem of course is that no one is allowed to do research on these compounds in any systematic way.

Another way it is put is that all kāyās at the time of the basis (before any realization occurs at all) are the dharmakāya. All kāyas at the time of the path are sambhogakāya. All kāyas at the time of the result are the nirmanakāya.

Mapping the three kāyas to the clarity and emptiness of the mind, as I pointed out already, is from the point of view of the explaining the basis of the three kāyas, not their realization. We can say that emptiness corresponds to dharmakāya because dharmakāya is the the ultimate realization of the nature of reality. We can say that clarity corresponds to the sambhogakāya because clarity is evident and distinct and the sambhogakāya emerges as a visible result, and so on. There are many ways to parse these things. But parsing things in this way does not mean that the emptiness of one's mind is the resultant dharmakāya, such arguments destroy the path. Why, because the basis has not been realized in a proper way and that basis and the result are confused.

'The Dharmakaya, though manifesting itself in the triple world (past, present, and future), is free from impurities and desires. It unfolds itself here, there, and everywhere, responding to the call of karma. It is not an individual reality, it is not a false existence, but is universal and pure. It comes from nowhere, it goes to nowhere; it does not assert itself, nor is it subject to annihilation. It is forever serene and eternal. It is the One, devoid of all determinations. This Body of Dharma has no boundary, no quarters, but is embodied in all bodies. Its freedom or spontaneity is incomprehensible, its spiritual presence in things corporeal is incomprehensible. All forms of corporeality are involved therein; it is able to create all things. Assuming any concrete material body as required by the nature and condition of karma, it illuminates all creations. Though it is the treasure of intelligence it is void of particularity. There is no place in the universe where this Body does not prevail. The universe becomes, but this Body forever remains. It is free from all opposites and contraries, yet it is working in all things to lead them to Nirvana.'

In which system? In which context?

I am talking about the three kāyas of the result. Your comments, especially the comments from Kongtrul and so on are derived from discussions about the three kāyas of the basis, but they are not the actual three kāyas.

If you claim, as you have, that dharmakāya is only emptiness, there is the fault that dharmakāya will be a blank void. The dharmakāya is realization of emptiness, the realization of dharmatā. That realization is nondual with emptiness, but it still is a realization. A blank void cannot realize anything.

Furthermore, the next fault is that a blank void cannot be a source of anything, and dharmakāya is the source of the two rūpakāyas.

Then you have to change the roles given to sambhogakaya and nirmanakaya as the functional aspects. Because where dharmakaya refers to emptiness, the three bodies together make up a complete buddha-mind, and they do not exist separately.

Malcolm wrote:

Interesting. In the dictionaries online it translates to "rag, patched garment; wall, town". But if it means anything mindless, how is it specifically for rocks?

Malcolm wrote:
If it is for everything, it is also for rocks.

Astus said:
That is how it is parsed in some Vajrayāna contexts,  but never in sūtra, where it is generally treated as synonym of dharmakāya.
Maybe in TB, but have not encountered with it in EAB. But their unity is known:

"The dharmakāya, saṃbhogakāya, and nirmāṇakāya—
The three bodies are fundamentally a single body.
If one can see it oneself within the nature,
This is the cause of bodhi and the achievement of buddhahood."
(Platform Sutra, ch 10, BDK Edition, p 90)

Malcolm wrote:
The three kāyas are inseparable, just as your body, speech and mind are inseparable. Three aspects, one entity.

Astus said:
"The concluding practice is the conviction that the ordinary mind that was from the beginning the unity of clarity and emptiness is itself the naturally arising three kayas - its emptiness is dharmakaya, its clarity is nirmanakaya, and the union of those is sambhogakaya."

(Jamgon Kongtrul on Mahamudra of the Shangpa Kagyu, in The Treasury of Knowledge: Book Eight, Part Four: Esoteric Instructions, p 246).....

Malcolm wrote:
You can parse it like this, and this is very characteristic of the new tantra schools, where dharmakāya is related to the emptiness aspect of the nature of the mind, but that is not the real dharmakāya. As we already saw dharmakāya = jñānakāya.

The Śrī Māladevi Sūtra states:
The dharmakāya of the tathāgatas is space-like pristine consciousness, the kāya of the pristine consciousness of the tathāgatas.
Vasubandhu's commentary on the Dasabhumi Sūtra states very clearly:
With respect to that, the first deliverance is the dharmakāya that exists only through pristine consciousness, devoid of mind, intellect, or consciousness. Why? Because dharmakāya is the kāya of pristine consciousness.
The Amnāyamañjarī, a commentary on the Saṃputa Tantra states:
The kāya of pristine consciousness is the dharmakāya.
The Vimalaprabha, commentary on Kālacakra states:
The omniscient kāya of pristine consciousness is is the innate nature of the victors and is likewise the dharmakāya.
The Great Tantra Clarifying The Meaning of Freedom From Proliferation states:
Since there are no causes and conditions in the dharmakāya, 
self-originated pristine consciousness, it is not conditioned.
The Tantra of the Dimension Of Samantabhadra’s Pristine Consciousness, The Most Refined Gold states:
The buddhas of the three times are free from mind [sems]. 
Since they lack the group of eight consciousnesses, they also lack the mind. 
The self-originated essence, dharmakāya,
is the pristine consciousness that does not arise from mind.
Mipham says about this:
It must be understood that pristine consciousness does not arise from the mind because the reality of the mind is natural luminosity, just as emptiness, the dharmatā of all entities, is the reality of entities but does not arise from entities.
Furthermore, the Tantra of the View of the Great Perfection, Perfect Deep Pristine Consciousness states:
Since this self-originated essence that has always existed
was not produced from a cause nor generated by a condition,
be confident that the self-originated pristine consciousness
is the dharmakāya that was not fabricated through any sort of effort.
Mipham futher states:
However, that dharmakāya, the original knowing and empty pristine consciousness, does not need to be based on methods with characteristics such as the cessation the vāyu in the central channel and so on. [20/a] If there is no contraction between the empowerment that transfers the blessings of the guru and our own path of the Great Perfection’s introduction of the mind essence as the dharmakāya that actualizes the transcendent state (dgongs pa) of the nonarising original purity of one’s own mind, the pristine consciousness that resembles that is the meaning pristine consciousness indicated by the fourth empowerment.

It seems that Buddhist thinkers did not bother with creating a special word for the insubstantiality of rocks. Note: dharmakaya is just one of the three/four bodies, so it is not all there is to a buddha/mind.

Direct introduction uses three experiences: bliss, clarity and conceptuality to point to the nature of the mind. But the "nature of the mind" being pointed to is an example wisdom, not a result of analysis. It resembles the wisdom of buddhahood, but is not it. However, since it is not a result of analysis, it is easier to actualize the real nature of the mind based on introduction, or so the theory runs.

hence [the state of a buddha] is uncreated.
Since it possesses the peaceful dharmakaya,
it is described as being “spontaneously present.”
Since it must be realized through self-awareness,
it is not a realization due to extraneous conditions.
Uttaratantra Shastra

And that's just page two.  What is being said here seems to have no bearing at all to what has been said in this thread over the past few pages.

Malcolm wrote:
The translation is a little wrong:

Should be:
Because it is a nature without beginning, middle or end,
it is unconditioned. 
Because it is peaceful and the dharmakāya's possession,
it is called "effortless"
Since it must be realized by each one for themselves, 
it cannot be realized through other conditions.
Now then, Asanga's comment on "dharmakāya's possession" states, "it is seen distinctly by the dharmakāya."

And as the Nirvana Sūtra states several times:
Son of a good family, though tathāgatagarbha exists in their bodies, even tenth stage bodhisattvas see only a rough approximation of it.

If the Tathagatagarbha is primodial and unconditioned and beyond the range of samsaric beings then it would follow that:

a)  There is no reason to engage in wholesome actions because the Tathagatagarbha cannot be realised via them and there is no reason NOT to carry out unwholesome actions because the Tathagatagarbha cannot be effected/tainted by them.

b)  There is no way to become enlightened since our enlightened "bit" is already enlightened and can only be approached by the enlightened anyway.

c)  Samsara and Nirvana are mutually exclusive.

Seems to me to miss the whole point of Buddhism since it is the UNenlightened (ignorant) that need to be enlightened.

The teaching of tathagātagarbha is supposed to be encouraging, but it is never said anywhere it is something like an engine of liberation operating in the background. As the Uttaratantra states:

It is to abandon five faults
in whomever they exist:
timidity, criticizing sentient beings as inferior, 
holding the true to be false, 
slandering the true Dharma,
and elevating oneself.
It is also never said anywhere in the tathāgatagarbha literature that tathāgatagarbha is within the experiential range of anyone but the buddhas.

Well that's a strange view.  Are you saying that the Dharmakaya has no relation with the phenomenal world?  So how do/can I, a phenomenon, relate to my Tathagatagarbha?  Is my Tathagatagarbha seperate to me?  Is there an enlightened Greg, and an unenlightened Greg, and never the twain shall meet?

The "some" I am referring to are the Yogacara.

Malcolm wrote:
There is no such thing as a pure ālaya in Indian Yogacara.

In sutra, you can but have mere faith that you possess tathāgatagarbha, other than that, there is no way for you to relate with it. Only buddhas can perceive it.

A study of the Uttaratantra might prove useful for you.

So in order for one to "advance" in meditational practice one has to be "advanced" in meditational practice.  Interesting theory. When you cultivate dhyānas as a normal person, not an ārya, you are doing nothing more nor less than cultivating samsaric paths for rebirth.
If one is not attached to dhyana, then why would this necessarily lead to the cultivation of samsaric paths?

In which case, and please correct me if I am wrong, are you saying that we have to give up meditation practices (and here I include sadhana, mantra, Yidam, etc... all of which are meditation practices) and devote ourselves to Dana while waiting for stream entry to spontaneously manifest?

Malcolm wrote:
You are now changing the scope of the discussion. I was focused specifically on dhyāna.

The practices you describe are bhavana (sgom pa) practices, not specifically the cultivation (sgom) of dhyāna.

Because the pleasures of dhyāna are quite intense, there is a great danger of being distracted by them if one is an ordinary person. And they do create traces for rebirth in the form realms which need to be eradicated later, because their very cultivation is a form of karma. In fact, the main reason why the Buddha went through the eight dhyānas was to eradicate traces he created through meditating them previously. And of course, bliss, clarity and nonconceptuality themselves place one at risk for taking rebirth in one of the three realms, depending upon which one there is attachment for, which is why in Mahāmudra there are extensive remedies for attachment to these three experiences which result in rebirth in the three realms.

For all I know the mantra was being used before the 14th century, and this text is just further teaching on the practice. If you're answering with knowledge that it is indeed the first written appearance of the mantra, then thank you.

Mind is the subjective experience. To make it an object is not any more a subjective experience, therefore not the experience of another's mind, but a concept about what is in another's mind. In other words, you can think that I think about a ball. That happens even when I tell you that I think of a ball, so you know what I think about. Telepathy is knowing what I think without I telling you. But since there is no connection between the minds, what is the cause of knowing it? Without connection it is like seeing a ball that's in another room - there is no light reaching the eyes from the ball, so it cannot be seen.

Also, realized people (bodhisattvas, arhats) with liberated minds may indeed cognize characteristics when in post-euipoise. All the examples you gave merely demonstrate that point.

No, a great deal of that debt has already been paid down. Keep in mind, it is not the US economy that will be upset by a US default. If the Republicans get in, you can be sure that there will a) be another war b) that US debt will again grow.

But the debt is not really a problem, people imagine that it is because it sounds "bad." But that is a silly judgement which stems from not understanding how the economy works and how money is created (i.e. through lending).

Astus, indeed minds do not enter each other. However, in knowing the mind of another, what is required is that the mind to be known apprehends characteristics. If it does not apprehend characteristics, there is nothing for another to apprehend about that mind— for example, when some devas became unnerved when they could not locate a favored monk, they were informed that he was a) now an arhat b) in equipoise, which is why they were unable to find him with their minds.

I don't hold liquor against him, but in view of the wider Buddhist ethos (not to mention the Trungpa fiasco) this is in questionable taste. Is his point that tantra means incorporating samsaric delights into the path, like those famous peacocks in the poison grove? Or that we ought not to judge one another (or our gurus) according to normal, possibly dualistic / conceptual standards of spiritual propriety, lest we accidentally condemn Drukpa Kinlay? Is the consumption of intoxicants fundamentally different from the actions-to-avoid of the other precepts? Surely no one would produce a book like this, but about shoplifting, or slaughtering chickens.

Inequality is at its http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21621908-what-impressive-work-economic-history-tells-you-about-inequality-breaking. I don't dispute that education has increased. I say its distribution is unequal. At the end of the day husbands and wives sleep in the same bed, but poor people in other countries have no reprieve, and the only solace they might find in the narcissistic issues forwarded by developed nations is the possibility of joining them - which is the elites' worst nightmare. Unless these people are educated, in which case the most ambitious and unattached will emigrate, and they take all their horror stories with them, partly to earn sympathy and attention, partly as a poultice for their conscience.

Malcolm wrote:
Indeed, globally speaking, income inequality has never been higher in human history, this is perfectly true. But this state of affairs will not continue forever, or it will shift somewhere else. After all, it used to be the case that Europe was largely quite poor in comparison with China, the Muslim world and so on, and it was only the Columbian exchange which gave the Europeans and their descendants the present global dominance they presently enjoy.

In the meantime, while regressive forces such as Boko Haram may be may be acute, they are limited. In general, most people wish to emulate the lifestyle of Europe and North America, our civil liberties and opportunities, unequal though they may be when compared to the global economy as a whole. And for as long as people aspire to emulate our civil liberties and opportunities, they will continue advertise their support for equal rights, democracy and so on., as they do now, no matter how inexpertly or superficially.

This is a question of justice, which should be balanced against other principles of welfare. But the force you are talking about is largely unsolicited and coming from outside of these societies, which is unjust. Take Martin Luther King's hyperbole 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.' This approach has led to skilful change in some countries through embargo (such as South Africa), but only when the unjust group was of little economic value. The hypocrisy is evident when a group continues to enjoy economic benefit with another while being at odds with their principles. So forcefully liberate the Saudi people from their oppressive government if it means so much to you (I don't support this) but don't continue to buy their oil while decrying their iniquity. You need to make honour an implicit requirement for trade. Otherwise it is just your greed that is powering their inequality (not the cause, but the condition. See my previous posts).

Well I didn't mean to say that in order to pit him against you and argue over who's right and wrong. I'm more curious about why exactly it would not be understood as an abbreviation in that usage? He has an explanation of what gsal ba means as an adjective/adverb: "To be evident to the senses.  Although this could be taken as "clear", the term is used in the sense of "obvious", "evident", "distinct", and hence clear to the senses." Which seems to line up with your explanation.

I guess this distinction is more relevant when you're look at an actual instance when translating a text... Maybe not as helpful when just trying to understand the word.

Malcolm wrote:
The sanskrit term underlying gsal ba is vivṛta (and a few other terms that mean the same thing). For example, in one commentary on Hevajra, we find གསལ་བ་ནི་མངོན་པའོ, i.e., "clear" means "evident." A long commentary on Abhidharma states,"Clear means fully knowing, but unclear means it is not clear."

Your mind is empty, because it cannot be established, but it is "clear" because it is distinct.

With this logic anyone who says samsara is suffering should be given blows to the neck and groin. The essence of what you are saying is that a view of how things are, combined with modern pragmatism, results in reaffirming the state of things. The call to fight for rights does not liberate us from the conditions that deny them to us, it mires us in trying to fix what the sutras have always told us is beyond repair.

Malcolm wrote:
You seem to fail to understand that in order to give something away, first you must own it. If you give away or sell something which you do not own, in Buddhadharma this is considered theft. In order to give away your wife and children, no matter how unbearable it may seem to you to do so, as was the case in this jataka, the tacit understanding is that they are your property which can in fact be disposed of as you wish.

Your argument, "The call to fight for rights does not liberate us from the conditions that deny them to us, it mires us in trying to fix what the sutras have always told us is beyond repair," is morally bankrupt in so far as it suggests that the struggle for human freedom and rights (as well as the freedoms and rights of animals, plants, and all other living things) ought to be abandoned at the outset because it is "samsaric," and from a Mahāyāna point of view, is even more problematical, because it is predicated on the mistaken idea that one should never strive to improve conditions which result in temporary happiness for sentient beings. The Buddha himself never hesitated to to advise rulers to understand the rights of their subjects and their own obligation to defend those rights. In fact, improving the temporary conditions of sentient beings through supporting the struggle for human rights in general, and women's rights specifically, properly falls within the Mahāyāna's four means of conversion (offering protection). Indeed, your reactionary dissent shows that you have utterly failed to understand that Mahāyāna Buddhists should be in the vanguard of the struggle for human and ecological rights precisely because aiding those who are in need of protection and emancipation (and there is no better way to ensure secular protections and emancipation than through social justice predicated on a theory of intrinsic rights) precisely falls within the activity of a bodhisattva, for example, HH Dalai Lama, Bhikku Bodhi, Roshi Glassman, Thich Naht Hahn and many others.

While the seeds of the emancipation of women, the explicit condemnation of slavery and human trafficking, and so on, can all be found in the twelve limbs of the Buddha's teachings, so too can regressive attitudes and practices, such as the patriarchal notion and practice of considering women and children to be the property of husbands and fathers.

Buddhists need to be honest about these patriarchal memes in Buddhist core literature, as well as secondary literature, and understand them, analyze them, and not make wan excuses for their presence in our Dharma traditions. Why? Well, for one, in the West, arguably, the majority of active practitioners of Buddhadharma appear to be women. Buddhadharma must accommodate this situation. To accommodate it, we must recognize that within Buddhadharma sexist and patriarchal culture forms have been preserved and promulgated, which has lead to the disenfranchisement of women. For example, given the literary output of Western women in the past 100 years, one can hardly imagine any other reason there are so few women Buddhist authors in the past 2500 years than the fact that women were systematically barred from higher education and that their gender was the reason they were barred from such educations. The institutionalization of patriarchal norms in Buddhadharma is found right at the beginning of the bhikṣuni sangha, when it was declared that even the most senior bhiḳsunis were required to bow to and sit behind male novices.

The time for this to change has arrived. It is changing, and we should be supportive of these changes. For the first time in history there are women Geshes, thanks to HHDL, and so on. Male dominance in Buddhadharma is coming to an end, as it should, and for the first time in history, women are finding their voices in the Dharma. We should recognize that wholesale suppression of the Dharma voices of human women (as opposed the transvaluation of women's voices as ḍākinīs and so on, something extraordinary as opposed to something ordinary) for the past 2500 is a loss to the Dharma.

It always astonishes me when people who follow Buddhadharma are unwilling to address on of the chief causes of suffering among human beings, the exploitation of and discrimination against women, and are unwilling to take a hard look at the inequality women have been subjected to in Buddhist countries and how women are portrayed. For example, in the sūtra of the Guru of Medicine, this sentiment is expressed:
When I have attained the the awakening at of actualizing buddhahood in that unsurpassed perfect, complete awakening, any women who are afflicted by the one hundred faults of womanhood, who decry the state of womanhood, who wish to be completely liberated from birthplaces of women, they will turn away from the state of womanhood, and until they have attained the state of awakening will be born with a male gender.

There is nothing blameworthy in giving up one's wife and family, per se. But giving them up as slaves to a brahmin in order to perfect generosity could only be seen as laudable in an extremely patriarchal civilization where women and children have no legal status as holders of personal rights.

The story illustrates that in highly venerated Indian Buddhist Sūtras, a man's family was considered his chattel, to be disposed of as he wished, however he wished.

It is one of the most famous of all the Jatakas, carved into the walls of Angkor Wat.

At some centers it's a "badge of rank," and those within that framework recognize it as such.  Variously it's referred to as a DrupDra Zen, or Tummo Zen, etc. At some centers it's worn to distinguish merely serious lay practitioners from monks, who wear solid maroon.   Some centers encourage the straight white zen for layfolk, while wearing a straight white zen at other centers is taboo--unless you're "qualified."

Then again, wearing any sort of clothing really is no sign of anything.  Perhaps that's what you mean.  Some dress as monks, and are not monks.  Dzongsar Khyentse Rinpoche's comments are pretty clear, I think, in that regard.

Well wearing a striped ngakpa zen while keeping long hair still differentiates you from being a) a monk and b) merely a layperson with primarily worldly concerns even if you aren't wearing the entire uniform.

My opinion of Drukpa Kunlay's autobiography is that in the context of Tibetan culture, it is very bawdy, ribald, entertaining, and that for Tibetans it represents a kind of transgressive taboo breaking of an awakened person, in imitation of Indian Mahāsiddhas.

It is nevertheless sited within Himalayan patriarchal culture, and his attitude towards women, and that of 15th century Bhutanese men in general, leaves much to be desired from a modern perspective, much as, from a feminist perspective, Buddhism as a whole is rife with sexism. If you are not a woman, you might not be aware of how much the sexism in Buddhism is hurtful to our sisters, mothers, and daughters.

realising it relies on a complete transformation of perception and if we say 'well there's nothing to realise' then why not simply stay as we are?

Astus said:
To stay as we are would mean being lost in the concepts of gain and loss. Seeing that all is empty means that there is nothing that can be grasped. When there is nothing to be grasped, there is no attachment, and without attachment there is no suffering. But nothing to grasp doesn't mean total blankness, it means that all experiences constantly change, hence nothing to rely on. That is the non-abiding mind, but not simply mindlessness.
Realisation pertains to the nature of reality, or to the 'nature of all experience' if you like. As I understand it, that is why realisation is for keeps, it doesn't come and go
The realisation is the realisation of all being in a flux. It is giving up the mistaken idea of permanence, and one that misconception is completely removed, there is no view attached to, and that lack of grasping doesn't come and go.

Mahāsiddha Virupa chimes in:

All sentient beings are emanations of mahāmudra,
the essence of those emanations is the forever non-arising dharmadhātu,
also all characteristics of dualistic appearances, happiness, suffering and so on,
are the play of mahāmudrā, the original dharmatā.

Because there is no truth and nothing on which to rely in play itself,
reality never transcends the seal of emptiness.

Some are completely tortured with empowerment rites,
some always count their rosary saying hūm phaṭ,
some consume shit, piss, blood, semen and meat,
some meditate the yoga of channels and winds, but all are deluded.
And:
That great profound term “mahāmudrā”, 
whatever it’s basis of designation is, also has the label “empty”;
as moments are empty by nature who realizes selflessness?
There is no realizer, just a name, a term, a label,
Also that is not perfect, a projection of disciples, 
also in disciples there is no self, similar with illusions and emanations,
“Mahāmudrā” is a mental imputation of the childish. 

“Delusion” and “non-delusion” are mere names, mere labels,
who is the person to feel or be aware of delusion?

If not even an iota of the result, nirvana, exists, and is not perceived,
“liberation and non-liberation” is an adventitious reification,
Nothing exists in peaceful and pure space, so what is the path of liberation?

“Ultimate and relative” are also just emphatic labels,
but the two truths don’t exist in the dharmadhātu, the dharmadhātu does not exist.
Mahāsiddha Kotalipa also adds his voice:
Inanimate and animate phenomena
abide as appearances because there is no duality;
they are naturally pure,
peace, space, and immaculate.

Nonduality is a merely a name,
even that name will not exist;
sensation and one who senses are free from signs,
nonduality is great bliss.

Liberated from all concepts,
without the dualism of duality, supreme peace,
like space, liberated from conceptuality,
that is called nondual, 

the meditation on the appearances of all phenomena
with the yoga of abiding in the inconceivable.
And:
whether I become a Buddha
or not and go to hell,
hell itself blissful.

What I find so strange is why a so called "prasangika" spends so much time on a species of mind-only theory. A proper Prasangika just accepts at face value what the world accepts. Certainly Candrakirtī never makes the distinction you are trying to make, and never would assert that direct perceptions are a result of imputations. For example, he states in his commentary to the MAV:
The wisdom that knows all aspects

i think Candrakirti's presentation is grounded on the buddhist bhumis which renders it more difficukt to extract the pure rational philosophy in contrast to the "Final exposition of wisdom" which actually consists of extracted chapters of Tsongkhapas's works but which is more easily accessible as to its rational philosophical core. One just has to skip certain chapters.

Direct perceptions are non-conceptual by definition, so what you propose is impossible.

Herbie said:
i would not say "impossible" but that it is the only way the expression "direct perception" could make sense: you can directly perceive objects only because you are familiar with the conceptual imputations of them. And "you are familiar" means that you are conditioned appropriately before you "directly perceive". So it boils down to the dichotomy of " inherently direct vs. inherently conceptual" being completely inappropriate.

Malcolm wrote:
No, Herbie, direct perceptions are by definition non conceptual. In other words, a direct perception happens when a sense organ and object and a moment of consciousness come together: for example, when an eye consciousness apprehends a blue object before any labeling of the object as blue occurs.

As the flip side of wisdom, the perfection of knowledge can be seen as the function or implementation of wisdom -- but fully informed by wisdom's insight into the essential.

Yes, I did say that, not because I was advocating Vedanta, but because of the impossibility of making the mind an object.

The essay by the Dalai Lama says:
As to the question of whether or not a single mental state can observe and examine itself, this has been a very important and difficult question in the Buddhist science of mind. Some Buddhist thinkers have maintained that there is a faculty of mind called "self- consciousness," or "self-awareness." It could be said that this is an apperceptive faculty of mind, one that can observe itself. But this contention has been disputed. Those who maintain that such an apperceptive faculty exists distinguish two aspects within the mental, or cognitive, event. One of these is external and object-oriented in the sense that there is a duality of subject and object, while the other is introspective in nature and it is this that enables the mind to observe itself. The existence of this apperceptive self-cognizing faculty of mind has been disputed, especially by the later Buddhist philosophical school of thought the Prasangika.

There is no organized curriculum, by any NIchiren groups AFAIK, that can provide an accessible and practical approach starting with basics through the higher levels of practice. Japan was so unstable in the 13th, 14th and 15th centuries and the Nichiren community immediately after Nichiren's passing more or less struggled. Nichiren's description of the Daimoku as an amulet tied around our necks really bore out. Through those centuries of turmoil, little survived except the Daimoku. We certainly lost the curriculum Nichiren taught which appears to have been heavily loaded with study of Zhiyi, Zhanran and Saicho, and without that foundation, I don't think you can really understand him.

At this point, the curriculum needs to be reconstructed. I don't see anyone in a position to do that. SGI is stuck and lost without Ikeda. Shoshu has gone back to being their closed off sect. Nichiren Shu, while pleasant and open does not seem to have the inspiration, content to be the managers of historic temples. To the extent that they've innovated practices, it seems to be in the direction of Japanese style asceticism. Everyone else seems like they are sleep walking through the performance of the traditional rites.

Just one question: You are aware probably, that such logic is not valid reasoning according to Western philosophical standards, right? In Western thought you of course cannot conclude from the premise "...did not exist..." to "...would not be any different than physical matter...". According to Western thought, if something did not exist, then it could not be either different or same as anything else that does exist. (Whether a non-existent thing is same or different from another non-existent thing is an open question.)

Malcolm wrote:
The passage means that if the basis isn't a consciousness, it would be inert, like the four elements.

What is the basis? Garab Dorje states in a commentary in the Vima Snying thig:
"The fundamental basis is the trio of essence, nature and compassion of each individual's vidyā."
We saw already that essence, nature and compassion are aspects of what is termed "pristine consciousness" aka ye shes or primordial wisdom.

I also want to point out, that though it may seem to some people that Dzogchen is proposing some temporal beginning to samsara and nirvana, this is really not the case. Dzogchen is not a cosmology. It is a phenomenology of bondage and liberation.

Dante, the term "basis" describes a state of nonrealization, nothing more.

We use the term to describe a set of qualities of what is termed "pristine consciousness." The basis is a consciousness, term "pristine consciousness, as the Six Dimensions states:
Because pristine consciousness has three aspects, 
the basis is explained in different words.
The Sgra thal gyur states:
The pristine consciousness dwelling in its own essence
is inseparable in three modalities.
Further, the Illuminating Lamp commentary on Sgra thal gyur states
the pristine consciousness—subsumed by the consciousness which apprehends primordial liberation and the abiding basis as ultimate—is inseparable in all buddhas and sentient beings as a mere consciousness.
A rock in a garden is just a projection of a mind that does not recognize its own state. This is very explicitly stated of inanimate objects — they are reified out of the five lights from our nonrecognition of the five lights. For example, the Illuminating Lamp states:
The luminous aspect of delusion resulting from that is stirred by a subtle vāyu. Also, all the previous lights are stirred and obscured, such that the light’s own appearance grows dimmer and dimmer. After it becomes impure, the latent appearances of earth, water, fire, and air emerge and appear as subtle particles.
Etc.

although the discourses of the eighty-four thousand aggregates of Dharma and so on,
taught by all the victors of the three times,
are equal with space and immeasurable,
in reality, they were taught in order to realize one’s own mind;
apart from this, nothing else was taught by the victors.

And:
All perceived appearances are the appearances of one’s mind.
The outer world that appears to be inert is the mind.
The sentient beings inhabiting it appearing in six classes are also the mind.
The appearance of the happiness of the higher realms of gods and men is the mind.
The appearance of the suffering of the three lower realms is also the mind.
Avidyā appearing as the five poisons is also the mind.
Vidyā appearing as self-originated pristine consciousness is also the mind. [106]
Negative thoughts appearing as the traces of samsara are also the mind.
Positive thoughts appearing as buddhafields are also the mind.
The appearance of obstacles of ghosts and demons is also the mind.
The appearances of gods and siddhis are also the mind.
The appearances of the variety of concepts are also the mind.
Non-conceptuality, appearing as one-pointed meditation, is also the mind.
The signs and colors of things are also the mind.
The absence of signs and non-existence of proliferation is also the mind.
Appearances without the duality of being one or many is also the mind.
Appearances that are not established as being either existent or non-existent are also the mind.
There are no appearances at all apart from the mind.

And:
This relaxed unfabricated ordinary mind
is the vast space of the realization of the Jinas free from extremes.
Frankly, my friend, I think you are a little too hung up on words.

yet he also says that through the experience of emptiness and clarity one may discover instant presence/rigpa. And discovering rigpa means, first the discovery of the inseparability of emptiness and clarity, not as experiences but as the nature of reality, and then, through that, the discovery of the basis, which, as he says, is the nature of both the individual and the universe.

Malcolm wrote:
The universe does not exist outside the minds that project it, and there is no inseparable clarity and emptiness for us to discover apart from the inseparable clarity and emptiness of our own minds. The fact that we can discover the knowledge of our own state through the three experiences proves that we are discovering the knowledge of the real state of our own minds, and nothing else. As far as the reality of the universe goes, well as Āryadeva put it, when one discovers the emptiness of one thing, one discovers the emptiness of all things, and as the Dzogchen tantras put it, knowing one thing liberates everything ( gcig shes kun grol ).

You should should also bear in mind that the experience of clarity, which is connected with lhun grub, is just an example, the same goes with the experience of emptiness, it is merely an example. This is why, for example, we don't attain the first bhumi at direct introduction (99.999 percent of us at any rate) —— that only happens if one happens to be diligent enough to reach the third vision in this life.

Malcolm wrote:
so what you are saying is that when someone perceives emptiness and enters the first buhmi, they are not perceiving emptiness, just non-conceptuality?[/quote]

What I am saying is that the the term "experience of emptiness" refers to an experience of nonconceptuality, where one's mind seems empty of thoughts and concepts (actually there is still a very subtle stream of thoughts and concepts). It is not the same thing as realizing emptiness, a point which ChNN (since he seems to be the only authority you accept) has made repeatedly over the years.

Likewise, "the experience of clarity," as opposed to the clarity aspect of the nature of mind, refers to a heightened sense of awareness, where, as ChNN notes, Longchenpa describes being aware of things even though they are outside of his immediate audiovisual range, such as features of the mountains behind him and so on.

The experience of bliss, obviously, does not refer to the bliss of awakening, but rather pleasurable sensations, for example, during sexual intercourse.

As to your first question, these are indeed karmic appearances.

As to your second question, a buddha perceives only a display of pristine consciousness, so pristine consciousness or primordial wisdom is what is "actually" there once the delusion ceases.

This is old argument in Tibetan circles. What Tsongkhapa actually argues is that the posited liquid substance  is validly divisible into six portions: molten iron, pus and blood, water as an environment, water as water, and water as nectar over which asuras and devas squabble, thus rendering all perception conventionally valid, not only in their own domain, but generally so.

those who are interested in the Ati Dzogpa Chenpo teaching and follow its principle must first of all train earnestly in separating nature of the mind, or instant presence, from mind. The principal reason for the need for this separation is to avoid the deviation and error that can occur when most practitioners apply the practice on the path, i.e. that of mistaking experiences such as emptiness or clarity for our real nature.
So: our real nature is beyond emptiness and clarity. That is the basis, and direct knowledge of that is rigpa.

Likewise, we don't need to speak about the basis in plural or singular terms because we can understand at the outset the term "basis" refers to the dharmatā of the mind, and not some entity out of which minds arise, or in which they are somehow located.

Since the ultimate pervades them without any nature at all, it is contained within each individual consciousness.
this is very different from saying, as you do, that the ultimate is each individual consciousness

Malcolm wrote:
I never said that each individual consciousness was ultimate per se. The point is that the ultimate (inseparable luminosity and emptiness) is a generic attribute they all share, in the same way all fires share the generic attribute of heat, and so on, or that each and every entity is empty. As Candra points, all things have two natures, one relative, one ultimate. In Madhyamaka, the ultimate nature of each and everything is emptiness. This is true also in Dzogchen; but in Dzogchen, not only are all minds ultimately empty, they are also ultimately luminous. This inseparable luminosity and emptiness is given the name "one's unfabricated mind" by Vimalamitra, or as Mipham puts it:
That basis is originally pure from the aspect of lacking any proliferation, and since it is not solely empty like space, its impartial clarity is naturally perfect without being delimited or falling into extremes. Since it is the source of the appearances of all samsara and nirvana, compassion is said to pervade everything. In the Dharma terminology of the Great Perfection, the pristine consciousness that is said to be three-fold. 

Likewise, in the sūtras and tantras,  it called “the dhātu” and “emptiness” from the aspect of the characteristic freedom from all kinds of proliferation that cannot be perceived at all. [4/a] From the aspect of intrinsically radiant (mdangs) clarity it is called “self-originated pristine consciousness.” Since it does not change in aspect, it is called “original mind (sems),” “original mind (yid),” “naturally luminous mind,” “the vajra of mind,” “the vajra of space that pervades space” and so on. Even though there is an explanation with many different names, all of them are not different in meaning than dharmatā of the mind, the nondual dhātu and vidyā, or bodhicitta, the ultimate reality is like a vajra.
 
Therefore, since the so called “dharmadhātu” is not understood to be only empty, it is the emptiness that possesses the supreme of all aspects, whole and indivisible from luminosity. Though it is called “self-originated pristine consciousness,” the subjective mind that realizes the emptiness of the duality, and of subject and object, does not know conditioned signs. It is also necessary to understand that such natural clarity does not have an iota of a sign that can be designated as conditioned.

The bodhicitta mentioned in the mind series of the Great Perfection, the dharmadhātu mentioned in the space series, the self-originated pristine consciousness mentioned in the intimate instruction series, the dharmadhātu mentioned in the Prajñāpāramitā, the original mind mentioned in most of the mantra tantras and so on may have different names by virtue of their purposes, but since the meaning to understand is the pristine consciousness of that meaning which illustrates the union of knowing and emptiness, the reality of all phenomena, it is the original connate pristine consciousness. Since it is naturally settled dharmatā because it is not generated by the traces of transmigration’s three appearances, it is called the great bliss that is free from all pain of transmigration.

If you realize yourself, you realize the nature of the universe"

Malcolm wrote:
There is no need to remove "mind" from the sentence, since rig pa is knowledge that a mind has, apart from which, no rig pa is possible. This is the reason why prajñā and vidyā are synonymous. For example, Vimalamitra in the Vima sNying thig, among the five definitions of vidyā, which are contextual, states first that vidyā is "a clear nonconceptual consciousness contaminated by many consciousnesses." The second type is the vidyā that appropriates the basis (meaning the body) existing in the body, generates consciousness, existing within its own clarity, also termed, "unripened vidyā." The third type of vidyā is the one that exists in the basis, defined as possessing three pristine consciousness of essence, nature and compassion. The fourth is defined as the vidyā of insight, vipaśyāna, having to do with the visions. The fifth is the vidyā of thögal, here meaning vidyā at the conclusion of the fourth vision.

In the end, all five of these are just means of talking about one's own mind and it's knowledge of its own state or lack thereof, since all five of these vidyās, Vimalamitra points, are essentially the same.

I don't think a giant stupa actually, materially came out of the ground and floated up in the air while Shakyamuni was discoursing with disciples at Grdhakuta some eight years before his parinirvana. That does not mean to me that its an untrue story.

The Lotus Sutra more or less says that its fiction if you read between the lines. The parables of the burning house, the rich man and poor son, the phantom city, the good doctor who sends word that he is dead, Shakyamuni who was born at Lumbini, awakened at Gaya, turned the Wheel at Sarnath, and passed at Kusinagara - he says its all upaya. It presents the Buddha as saying, everything is an expedient to bring you to awakening and make you equal to me.

Look, Mahāyāna sūtras are not history, no sūtras or tantras are. They are legends about people who lived 2500 years ago. However, the legendary though they may be, this does not mean they are not documents of events.

One tantra states, "The single vajra word is heard differently by those of different capacities."

Nyala Pema Dudul was a buddha. If he says he chatted with Vajrapani, I believe him. Three of my teachers are tertons. One of them (now deceased) chatted with Guru Padmasambhava regularly as clearly as we are typing words on this board. If you ever meet such a person, worries about whether the scenario in the Lotus Sūtra, etc., happened or not will vanish. Such concerns just are not important.

You can put scare quotes around "mind" and make all kinds of distinctions in English around words you have not defined nor clarified; but the basic reality is this: Dzogchen teachings describe how sentient beings become deluded, and how to remedy that delusion with the path.

"mind" is an imputation, a conceptual proliferation. the basis is neither since it is beyond all conceptual categories. seeing this directly is called rigpa.

Malcolm wrote:
No, seeing that the display of the mind as your own state is called "rigpa."

For example, how do "sense organs rise up from the basis" in the following citation from the sgra thal gyur?
since the buddhas did not become deluded,
the sense organs that rose up out of the basis
recognized the self-appearances as natureless
For that matter, how would one account for this citation as well?
In the basis, totally undifferentiated
and undefined,
consciousness is grasped as moving, vanishing,
and spreading out,
and holding taints through accumulation.
Moreover, we here have a citation from the commentary on the sgra thal gyur would adds more understanding:
In Ati, the pristine consciousness—subsumed by the consciousness which apprehends primordial liberation and the abiding basis as ultimate—is inseparable in all buddhas and sentient beings as a mere consciousness. Since the ultimate pervades them without any nature at all, it is contained within each individual consciousness.
Again, the so called generic basis is set of qualities which all consciousnesses share.

Even when we get to defining sems, what does the sgra thal gyur say?
Sems enters the pure and impure
three realms, and also buddhahood.
The basis has an aspect of consciousness, as the Six Dimensions clearly states:
If that aspect of pristine consciousness did not exist, 
it would not be any different than the physical matter of the four elements.
If it were the case that the basis was single entity, there could not be separation of samsara and nirvana. How can delusion be accounted for, which is the whole reason for describing the basis? As Vimalamitra further states:
[D]elusion arises from the difference between the basis and the conscious aspect of the basis.
If the basis is some unitary entity, this conscious aspect would have to be unitary, etc., in the sense that it would there could be no diversity. But when it is understood that the basis is generic set of attributes of every consciousness, there are no contradictions which remain.

In other words, Dzogchen is describing a phenomenology of liberation and delusion, and the language around the so called "basis" is merely a starting point for discussing that which we are deluded about. What we are deluded about is the nature our own states, and apart from a stream of empty consciousness, there is no other state that is under discussion.

Malcolm wrote:
The basis is just your mind. Not your thoughts, not its content, etc. It has three qualities, essence, nature, and compassion.

There is no basis apart from your mind, in its unfabricated, unmodified state. If this wasn't the case, your nonrecognition of the five lights would not result in samsara, and your recognition of the five lights would not result in buddhahood. But in any case, it is just your own mind and its characteristics we are discussing. These five lights are just the result of the stirring of vāyu which is the internal movement of your own consciousness prior its self-recognition/nonrecognition.

Now, you don't have to accept the Dzogchen account of the basis and the arising of the basis, and that is just fine with me. But let's not pretend that Dzogchen has some other kind basis in mind than the one I have just described.

From the point of view of the potentiality of the basis, your own consciousness, the basis is luminosity; from the point of the essence of the basis, your own consciousness, the basis is emptiness free from extremes. This emptiness and luminosity are inseparable, and are the essence and nature of your own mind. This is all very clearly explained in Dzogchen texts, I am not sure why you have a problem with this.་

Further, the basis is only called "the basis" because one has not realized this.

It is not really that complicated. We say that minds are empty and luminous. When we analyze a given mind (for example, our own, since we cannot examine the minds of others), all we can discover is emptiness and luminosity. These are the irreducible facts that pertain to minds. The fact that minds are empty means they are free from extremes and not monadic, or even plural entities. The fact that they are luminous means that they are not inert, like rocks, etc. We don't need to discuss these things in terms of the two truths, because there is no separation between the two truths anyway.

Mipham for one distinguishes between valid and invalid conventional cognition, and also various levels of pure vision--- accordingly, a human being's vision is more "pure" than a preta's, but still under the influence of delusion.

For example, the Chinese original text where it literally reads Bodhidharma faced a wall for 9 years, in the Tibetan translation of the same passage, the passage reads "faced reality." In explaining Chan to Tibetans, Chinese Chan masters often had to depoetacize their texts to make them understandable to Tibetans. Studying Chan texts in Tibetan translation is illuminating because of the (invisible) oral commentary that was required to make often multivalent passages in Chinese comprehensible to non-Chinese speakers, and it gives us a sense of use of how colloquial passages that are hard to understand were understood at that time.

Taigen Dan Leighton
Dōgen’s Appropriation of Lotus Sutra Ground and Space

The Lotus Sutra is prominent among the many sources quoted by Dōgen in his
writings, highlighting the Mahāyāna context of his teachings and worldview.
In this paper I focus on Dōgen’s use of the pivotal story in Lotus Sutra chapters
fifteen and sixteen—the myriad bodhisattvas emerging from underground and
the inconceivable life-span of the Buddha—to express his own worldview of
earth, space, and time as enlightening forces. The shift in perspective expressed
in this sutra story reflects a fundamental shift in East Asian Buddhist soteriology.
A close reading of Dōgen’s references to this story discloses how his hermeneutical
play with its imagery of ground, space, and emptiness expresses
immediate awakening, beyond stages of cultivation; he cites the inconceivable
life-span story as an encouragement to present practice.

...

A full investigation of the roles of metaphor, polysemy, and intertextuality in
Dōgen’s writing would be illuminating, but is far beyond the scope of this essay.
However, Dōgen’s use of metaphor as applied to “ground,” “underneath,” and
“space” may be somewhat clarified by some of Paul Ricoeur’s discussion of metaphor.
Ricoeur says, “The understanding of a work taken as a whole gives the
key to metaphor…. The hermeneutical circle encompasses in its spiral both the
apprehension of projected worlds and the advance of self-understanding in the
presence of these new worlds” (Ricoeur 98, p. 7). Dōgen’s playful interpretations
of the world of the Lotus Sutra certainly express a pre-understanding of
a “projected world,” and also a self-understanding, or rather, Dōgen’s particular
understanding of the inner nature of self itself, from his Buddhist perspective.
His interpretive play with the world of the Lotus Sutra, in turn, further informs
and explicates the world of Dharma and practice he is expressing.

Sign and signified - "Impermanence" is something we can talk about - its a concept, a descriptive of how things are. The actual reality, is beyond words, concepts - it can only be known/realized, etc.

They understood that cancer was a disease in which certain cells of of the body run wild. They did not understand DNA sequencing, of course. Nor did they understand genetic switches. Cancer in general however was also much more rare than it is today. But they understood the disease in general and its many secondary causes. I study this for a living. The study and practice of Tibetan medicine is part of my livelihood. The chapters on brain injuries, injuries to the limbs, etc., are really quite remarkable for their modernity. Modern Surgery was invented by Sushruta roughly around the first century AD. His textbook on surgery (Sushruta Samhita) is also truly amazing and the implements he invented, shapes and all, are used to this day by surgeons around the world.

For example, one can certainly argue that reforms allowing greater access and equality for women, and greater opportunities for practice and exposure to the teachings by lay people, allow for the first time a majority of Buddhist sentient beings to have opportunities to awaken that they were de facto denied for millenia. This is so even though allowing such a role to women and lay folks often flies in the face of traditional ways. The women and lay folks were pretty much denied the opportunity even to ask those "existential questions", let alone engage in serious practice for solution.

Some ways will rely on traditional beliefs and assumptions more, even if modern science and understanding seem to point elsewhere. Others will reject such beliefs, turning instead to a Buddhism more informed by modern worldviews. (At one extreme, for example, there may still be those who seem Mt. Sumeru and traditional views of cosmology as how this world is physically organized, while others will come to see it as but helpful metaphor or simply some which can be done without).

Malcolm wrote:
There are several cosmologies taught in sūtra and tantra. Thus we can presume that cosmologies are something relative, which are in accordance with the relative perception of the karmic vision of sentient beings.

The goals of Buddhist practice and the existential questions which drive it have not changed. Frankly, if you don't ask the right question, you will not get the right answer, and this true also of Buddhadharma. I would argue that Buddhist modernism fails to recognize the existential questions that have driven people's motivation for practice for the past 2500 years, and seeks to replace the existential questions that drove Buddha to awaken with existential questions that won't lead anyone to awaken.

It's like creating contrast, I not sure if I can put it proper in the word to show what I mean, but ma rigpa is non existent as only means to stop and look.

Malcolm wrote:
My friend, I can assure you that is indeed the case that rig pa becomes ma rig pa. And why? Because vāyu stirred consciousness and that consciousness that does not recognize its own display is ma rig pa. As it states in my forthcoming translation (Wisdom, 12/16) of one of the most seminal of all Dzogchen commentaries:
As such, knowledge (vidyā, rig pa) itself becomes ignorance (ma rig pa, āvidyā) and nondelusion becomes delusion.
And how does this happen?
The trio of the essence, nature, and compassion of the original basis becomes the three ignorances. Since the essence is made the cause of delusion, it is designated “the ignorance of the same identity” and becomes so. Once the nature is made the condition of delusion, since the vāyu of the impelling karma manifests as color, it is designated “the connate ignorance” and becomes so. Compassion is made the result of delusion. Since pristine consciousness manifests as different names, that is designated as “the imputing ignorance” and becomes so. As such, from not recognizing that knowledge and ignorance have the same cause, like the front and back of one’s hand, the ignorance of the same identical cause arises from not arriving at ultimate nonduality. The connate ignorance (arising from the preceding) is a term of duality, meaning as soon as the conceit “this is originally pure” occurs, it is inseparable from that ignorance. Thus, ignorance depends on knowledge and delusion depends on nondelusion.
And as Vimalamitra states:
The vidyā that is moved and stirred by vāyu
is subtle; its stirring is difficult to understand.

You might wish to reconsider your point of view in this light.

Nope. All Bhavaviveka says is that in the refutation of an opponent's position, a consequence is insufficient to convince them of emptiness. They must be shown that emptiness is provable through a formal syllogism which destroys their position. Candrakirti disagrees, and asserts that a mere consequence is sufficient.

There are other things for which Candrakirtī (and later Tsongkhapa and many others) criticize Bhavaviveka, but they are inconsequential to his main point.

In other words, Tsongkhapa's Svatantra is not represented by Bhavaviveka. His Svatantra is just as idealized a school as his Prasanga. Neither idealized position exists in Indian Madhyamaka in the manner in which Tibetans since the 12th century have presented it.

It has taken some time for scholarly consensus to grapple with this, but it has gradually come around. In brief, Tsongkhapa's Madhyamaka is his own. Brilliant, unique, and scholarly, but it is not a Madhyamaka that is recognizable in any Indian school. In fact it represents a rapprochement of Madhyamaka dialects with a species of Buddhist logic invented in Tibet by Phyapa at Sangphu (a famous opponent of Candra and the formulator of the system of logic employed in Gelugpa).

There are many "modern" Buddhism(s) and many "traditional" Buddhism(s) developed by people in varied places over the millenia. But in general, "modern" means to me Buddhism which breaks traditions in ways heavily influenced by modern outlooks such as, for example, allowing women equality with men despite past restrictions, greater emphasis on actual lay practice (as opposed to a role as primarily a source of Dana for Merit), and a greater willingness to challenge, reject or revise stories, teachings and doctrine due to a modern understanding of historical events or how the physical universe works.

This is already accounted for in Buddhist teachings through the distinction between provisional and definitive teachings.

Bucking the consensus earns you the dubious privilege of being ignored and irrelevant.

Furthermore, when someone does ask me to explain something in Vajrayāna, if there is something I cannot express, I will be honest and direct about it, "I cannot explain this to you." I certainly do not badger people with insider rhetoric and then deride them for not understanding it, a pattern all too common in your posts.

Oh man. You can search up and down in the archives of Dharma Wheel and I would never call someone's Ordination "supposed".

Malcolm wrote:
I did not call anyone's ordination "supposed." I question it when people use their supposed authority (as scholars, what have you), or their ordinations (bhikshus, Zen preists, Ngakpas, etc.), to bolster their authority. Please read more carefully and be less reactive. Thanks.

For example, no where have I ever insisted that anyone listen to me because I have the benefit of expertise in Tibetan, have done a solitary three and 1/2 year retreat, and have been awarded an Ācarya (slop dpon) degree in Tibetan Buddhism as well as a degree in Tibetan Medicine. People listen to me because they have decided they agree with me. The people who do not listen to me have decided not to listen to me because they do not agree with me. But I would never insist that someone had to agree with me because of my credentials.

Does Buddhism also allow for gradual enlightenment? More like a slow dawning upon rather than a sudden flash.


Malcolm wrote:
It rather depends on what you mean by awakening. Awakening itself is the first moment of the so called ārya or noble path. This is then followed by a gradual eradication of the two kinds of obscuration. Prior to this moment of awakening, one is trying to realize the union of emptiness and compassion. When that is realized, one has awoken.

It will be in the eye of the beholder which doctrines are keepers, and which are outdated or inaccurate.

Malcolm wrote:
The point, which really seems to escape you, is that we all already know this. This is the essence of studying tenet systems for example, where it is understood that Vaibhashika is superior to Pudgalavada, Sautrantika superior to Vaibhashika, Yogacara superior to Sautrantika, and Madhyamaka the supreme intent of Buddha's common Mahāyāna teachings.

However, there is such also thing as community consensus, and on such issues as rebirth, the existence of three kāyas and so on, the career of the bodhisattvas, there is here too a general consensus. For example, there is a consensus among Japanese Buddhists that their ordinands are monks. However, there is a wider consensus that they have not fit the bill as such for some centuries, and definitely not since the Meiji era. I don't pretend to be expert at negotiating these differing consensuses, but then I don't have to be. For example, there maybe a consensus among Vajrayāna Buddhists that the only path to awakening in a single lifetime, from soup to nuts, is highest yoga tantra, but in conversations with people who do not share that consensus, I don't discuss it at all. What would be the point? So I don't bring it up.

jundo cohen said:
Further, many doctrines and beliefs which may be inaccurate based on their original premise can be retained for other reasons. For example, I no longer believe that the "Platform Sutra of the Sixth Patriarch" represents the accurate and actual words of the Sixth Patriarch "Hui-neng", if such a person in that capacity actually existed at all. Scholars have produced very strong, redundant and convincing evidence that the work was written later, is largely fiction, possibly as a bit of inter-sect politics.

Your example is not an example of doctrine or belief. Is there something the Platform Sūtra you dispute or find archaic, apart form dismissing its author and his hagiography as legendary and not historical?

Hi Dave, you did just fine.

Several years ago I was in a bad place. I sent emails to two teachers asking them for help and advice. The question I asked them was regarding samaya. I wanted to know if I had broke mine. I had been in a cult which left me devastated. I won't name the cult because of TOS of Dharmawheel. As a result I spoke out against the cult and its teacher. I created a group called the Survivors for former members of the cult. The group became a success and in September of last year His Holiness the Dalai Lama met with Survivors and even invited them to attend his teachings in India this year. I have received a lot of thanks from people over the years for creating the group. One man even thanked me for saving his marriage. When I first created the Survivors group I wasn't sure if I did the right thing. We after all where being critical of our former teacher. So when I asked for advice I was surprised to get two different answers. One teacher told me it was the wrong thing to do, and I did break my samaya. He went so far to suggest the result will be hell for me when I die. The other teacher on the other hand said I did nothing wrong. The teacher from the cult I was in had broken his samaya with His Holiness the Dalai Lama and had been expelled from his university. According to the second teacher I had no samaya to break. I have struggled with this for several years and would like to know how others feel about it. Did I do the wrong thing by creating the group? Just in case I did  send a letter to my former teacher and begged his forgiveness for speaking so harshly about him. I would like to get past this but I really don't know enough about samaya to know which teacher is correct. So any help would be appreciated.

Thanks,
David

So, is the policy that I can go into any section of Dharma Wheel and "set you guys straight" (not that I would, and certainly not that you guys would see me as "setting you straight"? ) That is not what I was told several times about how this place works. I was told to stay in the Zen Section or here because people consider my criticism and skepticism of certain doctrines and historical claims as "attacks" on their beliefs and schools. I never intend my opinions to be an attack on anyone.

Anyway, even if I could go in, I would just not go into the Tibetan or Nichiren sections and "set people straight" (not that they would see it that way). WHY? I do not meddle with people's beliefs, but celebrate them and let each person be. It would not happen. I have no interest (or expectation) of "setting anybody straight" and, furthermore, my "straight" is crooked to someone else, their "straight" is crooked to me. May we each and all walk our own straight and crooked paths.

Anyway, that is a side issue ... forget I mentioned it.

The definition of valid cognizer is a cognizer that is non-deceptive with respect to its engaged object. Conventionally, if the mind is valid the object that it perceives is also valid and exists, and mind and object are mutually dependent.

Malcolm wrote:
If you assert, as you are, that a valid cognizer depends on a valid object, and that a valid object depends on a valid cognition, the consequence of this is two fold: a valid object will always be valid, irregardless of whether it is cognized or not, because it determines whether or not the cognition that perceives it is valid or not. A valid cognizer will always be valid irrespective of whether it's object is delusive or nondelusive because its validity is what makes the object valid.

For example, in a dream, appearances seem valid. We react to them as if they are valid. We only determine dream appearances to be invalid when we wake. How is waking consciousness actually different than a dream consciousnesses? Unlike a dream, we have no outside reference to judge its validity. However, our waking consciousness is merely a dream as well, and when compared with the consciousness of a Buddha, is found to be wholly invalid.

Of course we can always claim that a certain practice is "not exactly" the same as another one, but such an argument is really futile. Just look at the enourmous amount of various tantric texts in Vajrayana, where each and every text says something slightly different than the other one.

The third area of difference between Kashmir Śaivism and Vedānta concerns the essence, the substance, the basis of this universe. Vedānta holds that this universe is untrue, unreal. It does not really exist. It is only a creation of illusion (māyā). Concerning this point, Kashmir Śaivism argues that if Lord Śiva is real, than how could an unreal substance come out from something that is real? If Lord Śiva is real, then His creation is also real. Why should it be said that Lord Śiva is real and Hs creation is an illusion (māyā)? Kashmir Śaivism explains that the existence of this universe is just as real as the existence of Lord Śiva. As such, it is real, pure, and solid. This is nothing about it at all which is unreal."
-- pg. 104, Kashmir Shaivism, The Secret Supreme; 1st Books,  2000.

In Dzogchen it is held that the appearance of the universe is caused by the imputing ignorance which is a result of the neutral awareness at the time the basis arises from the basis not recognizing its own appearances as being its own state. Needless, to say, that mind is also empty, and lacks any nature or inherent existence. That mind is also individual, which accounts for why Samantabhadra woke up at the time the basis arose from the basis, and sentient beings did not.

In short, the foundation of Dzogchen teachings is the Buddha's teaching of the five elements, five aggregates, emptiness, dependent origination,etc.; while the foundation of Kashmir Shaivism is Samkhya, with an added eleven principles on top of Samkhya's original 25, in addition to asserting there is only one universal puruśa, Śiva, as opposed to Samkhya's assertion that there are infinite individual puruśas.

Here there are some philosophical parallels with Dzogchen. Although the Tibetan term rtsal, “energy, potency, potentiality”, is never glossed as Shakti in the Dzogchen texts, the conceptions embodied in these two terms are quite similar. The Dzogchen term rig-pa’i rtsal, “the potency or energy of awareness”, could almost be translated as Vidyashakti, which is a technical term found in the Shaiva and Shakta systems. It refers to the energy inherent within the primordial non-dual Awareness which gives rise to the diversity of manifestations. Also, the term for “manifestation” or “appearance” (snang-ba, abhasa), is found in a similar context in both systems.
Malcolm has dismissed the idea of a "primordial non-dual Awareness which gives rise to the diversity of manifestation."

Virgo is coming from a tradition where before one can even really begin to say one is practicing the main point, first one has to distinguish the mind (sems, citta) from pristine consciousness (ye shes, jñāna). One must also learn the distinction between ignorance (ma rig pa, avidyā) and knowledge (rig pa, vidyā, usually mistranslated as "awareness" by translators of Tibetan texts.)

This is exactly what dependent existence is because everthing that is imputedly existent is dependently existent, i.e. dependent on imputation.

Malcolm wrote:
Herbie, there are four terms at word here at work here: svabhāva, parabhāva, bhāva and abhāva.

Nāgārjuna defines dependent or extrinsic existence (parabhāva) as a species of inherent existence (svabhāva).

As I pointed out to you already, bhāva (existence) is included in svabhāva.

Nāgārjuna is saying that if you cannot prove or establish svabhāva, you cannot prove bhāva. If you cannot prove bhāva, you also cannot show abhāva, i.e., nonexistence, since abhāva is always the nonexistence of something that once existed.

This translation is incorrect. It is from this passage:
Samantabhadri is the unrestricted vast sphere.
Vast Samantabhadra is displayed to all.
Samantabhadra father and mother have a non-dual single form. 
The state of Samantabhadri endowed with the meaning of realization
arises as every diversity since her unchanging bhaga is vast. 
The whole universe is included in her bhaga. 
The bhaga of the mother is the field of great emptiness. 
The non-dual form of the father and mother totally pervade migrating beings.

According to The Golden Letters, there are significant similarities between the Dzogchen and Shaktism view.
The view associated with Kashmiri Shaivism and with Shaktism is known as Shaktivada, wherein Maya, or the world illusion, in all its diversity, is granted a certain ontological status. This diversity is an illusion in the sense that it lacks any inherent or independent reality, but it does possess a kind of relative reality in that it represents the energy, or shakti, of Chit, or primordial awareness (chitshakti). Maya is thus not just a mistake in perception, mistaking the rope for a snake; it is not something merely passive but something active and dynamic, a creative energy, or Mayashakti, which brings diversity into manifestation. Here there are some philosophical parallels with Dzogchen. Although the Tibetan term rtsal, “energy, potency, potentiality”, is never glossed as Shakti in the Dzogchen texts, the conceptions embodied in these two terms are quite similar. The Dzogchen term rig-pa’i rtsal, “the potency or energy of awareness”, could almost be translated as Vidyashakti, which is a technical term found in the Shaiva and Shakta systems. It refers to the energy inherent within the primordial non-dual Awareness which gives rise to the diversity of manifestations. Also, the term for “manifestation” or “appearance” (snang-ba, abhasa), is found in a similar context in both systems.

Could anyone more knowledgeable go a little bit into the similarities and differences between the two philosophical views?

There is no universal basis in Dzogchen. The view of Dzogchen is emptiness.
