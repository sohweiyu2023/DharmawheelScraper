I know. I'm just not aware that Meister Eckart speaks of this soul's spark as a substance, and just because he calls it unconditioned doesn't mean it has to be wrong or completely opposed to the Dharma, because Buddha-nature is also unconditioned.

Malcolm wrote:
Are you making the assertion that use of the term “unconditioned” renders all traditions that use the term compatible? The sugatagarbha doctrine has a few variations, for example, the Lanka equates it with the all-basis consciousness. As I understand the term, tathagatagarbha refers to the union of the mind”s clarity and emptiness. That union is unconditioned, but the mind itself is conditioned. Just this is the “god” ChNN is referring to, and nothing else, since the basis is just this.

If you don’t discuss the teachings with those who are not interested, there is no risk of being seen as a narrow minded sectarian.

With respect to dhyana and so on, these mental states are not in and of themselves liberative. In fact, without right view they merely create paths of samsaric rebirth. Further, improper meditation blocks right view.

I mean, isn't that a little bit at odds with the spirit of Mahāyāna?  Obviously, we're not going to talk about advanced teachings we're not authorized to share with someone who wouldn't benefit from them anyway.  But things like śamatha, for example, can benefit everybody, even non-Buddhists.  Lamas like Chökyi Nyima Rinpoche and Alan Wallace have said it would be lacking in compassion not to share general teachings that can help alleviate suffering, relatively if not ultimately.  We are enjoined to rejoice even in the samsaric happiness of sentient beings.
Are other traditions profound? How so? How do they lead to something other than higher birth in samsara?
Even if you don't believe another tradition leads to anything beyond favorable rebirth, you're not going to get anywhere when engaging with a knowledgeable adherent of that tradition if you are willfully ignorant of it.  They will notice when you misconstrue it and rely on strawman caricatures of non-Buddhist teachings, brought out only to be summarily dismissed without serious investigation.  If you have actually studied different systems with sincerity and are still convinced that only Buddhist vehicles are valid, and that of those Atiyoga is the undisputed pinnacle, then they will respect your judgment more than if you come across as a narrow sectarian.
The only thing similar between Buddhadharma and other traditions is that we all emphasize compassion; but even here, the compassion of other traditions is limited in its scope.
I think the cultivation of attention, along the lines of śamatha, has parallels in the Hindu, Christian, and Sufi traditions; perhaps in others.  Nowadays it is taught even in secular contexts.  Not that these approaches are in every respect identical, but that ethically neutral meditative practice is fairly universal in the major world tradtions.  Someone who has cultivated their attention well, even if in a non-Buddhist context, might be better prepared to receive the View.  That compassion you mentioned couldn't hurt either, even if it isn't Great Compassion.

Fair enough.  Would it, however, be undue speculation to suppose that some non-Buddhists like Eckhart encountered the ālaya-vijñāna and then tried to articulate their experience in theistic language?  I thought that's what thousands of Hindus are supposed to have been doing all these years.

Malcolm wrote:
The ālaya-vijñāna is not an object of consciousness. The basic error nonbuddhist make is that they hold consciousness, whether dualistic like the Samkhya, or nondually like Advaita, to be permanent, unconditioned and so on. This is Eckhart's flaw as well. They do this because they do not have the view of dependent origination.

But Eckhart went further in deconstructing the very idea of God.  He talked about something called "the essence of God":

Eckhart, Sermon 87 said:
While I yet stood in my first cause, I had no God and was my own cause: then I wanted nothing and desired nothing, for I was bare being and the knower of myself in the enjoyment of truth.  Then I wanted myself and wanted no other thing: what I wanted I was and what I was I wanted, and thus I was free of God and all things.  But when I left my free will behind and received my created being, then I had a God. For before there were creatures, God was not 'God': He was That which He was.  But when creatures came into existence and received their created being, then God was not 'God' in Himself—He was 'God' in creatures.

Therefore I pray to God to make me free of God, for my essential being is above God, taking God as the origin of creatures.  For in that essence of God in which God is above being and distinction, there I was myself and knew myself so as to make this man. Therefore I am my own cause according to my essence, which is eternal, and not according to my becoming, which is temporal.  Therefore I am unborn, and according to my unborn mode I can never die.  According to my unborn mode I have eternally been, am now, and shall eternally remain.  That which I am by virtue of birth must die and perish, for it is mortal, and so must perish with time.  In my birth all things were born, and I was the cause of myself and all things: and if I had so willed it, I would not have been, and all things would not have been.  If I were not, God would not be either. I am the cause of God's being God: if I were not, then God would not be God. But you do not need to know this.

Spelare said:

The story of an "I" reposing in its first cause and then giving rise to creation sounds very much like the accounts we've heard of dualistic samsaric experience arising through non-recognition and the arising of false knowledge on the basis of ignorance.  In fact, I would suggest that that is what Eckhart is trying to get at.  But he phrases it in the language of "creation" that was known to everyone in his culture the same way that Buddhist accounts of how dualistic consciousness arises would be familiar to Buddhists.  Eckhart saw the need to go back to the ground from which all conceptual proliferation arises.

Does he have to have fully realized and integrated that awakening in order for us to suspect he had a genuine glimpse?  Of course we won't find Buddhist words coming out of his mouth, because he was unacquainted with Buddhism.  However, if we take seriously the teaching that all sentient beings have buddha-nature . . . very possible.

Spelare said:
Here is an example of what I am talking about.  If you read this, don't only scan for specific words that prove this author didn't realize the nature of mind (though you are, of course, free to do that).  Try to get a sense of what state he might be trying to communicate to his audience through the skillful means of the Biblical and Greco-Roman philosophical literature they would have been familiar with:

Meister Eckhart, Sermon 60 said:
I have sometimes spoken of a light that is in the soul, which is uncreated and uncreatable.  I continually touch on this light in my sermons: it is the light which lays straight hold of God, unveiled and bare, as He is in Himself, that is, it catches Him in the act of begetting.  So I can truly say that this light is far more at one with God than it is with any of the powers with which it has unity of being.  For you should know, this light is no nobler in my soul's essence than the humblest, or the grossest of my powers, such as hearing or sight or any other power which is subject to hunger or thirst, cold or heat, and that is because being is indivisible.  And so, if we consider the powers of the soul in their being, they are all one and equally noble: but if we take them in their functions, one is much higher and nobler than the other.

Therefore I say, if a man turns away from self and from all created things, then—to the extent that you do this—you will attain to oneness and blessedness in your soul's spark, which time and place never touched.  This spark is opposed to all creatures: it wants nothing but God, naked, just as He is. It is not satisfied with the Father or the Son or the Holy Ghost, or all three Persons so far as they preserve their several properties. I declare in truth, this light would not be satisfied with the unity of the whole fertility of the divine nature.  In fact I will say still more, which sounds even stranger: I declare in all truth, by the eternal and everlasting truth, that this light is not content with the simple changeless divine being which neither gives nor takes:

rather it seeks to know whence this being comes, it wants to get into its simple ground, into the silent desert into which no distinction ever peeped, of Father, Son or Holy Ghost. In the inmost part, where none is at home, there that light finds satisfaction, and there it is more one than it is in itself: for this ground is an impartible stillness, motionless in itself, and by this immobility all things are moved, and all those receive life that live of themselves, being endowed with reason.  That we may thus live rationally, may the eternal truth of which I have spoken help us.  Amen.

Spelare said:
In this passage, he is not using the words "God," "soul," "reason," "eternity," or even "truth" according to the commonly understood definitions of his own time (or ours).  They seem to have been the nearest approximations he hoped would be intelligible to his audience.  And often they still didn't understand, as he often comments in his writings!  Eckhart sought the ground prior to God, prior to being, and he sought it in himself, not in a distant separate entity above the sky.  Clearly, he had some recognition, even if we cannot be certain how to classify it.  Of course, that might be an interesting exercise, but I think his poetic evocation was intended to awaken his listeners.

Your taxes are still being used for war, even if you don't want them to be. You aren't intentionally supporting the war, but you are supporting it materially whether you like it or not, that was my point.

What are you basing this on, if I may ask?

Also, in many cases, you don't "pick sides", a war comes to your part of the world and you just have to respond, in many cases, its impossible for someone not to be already identified with a certain ethnic or national group by merely being born in it, speaking a language, etc. If one can do good by being a medic, providing relief for others etc in a military organization, then there is nothing wrong with this.

If one keeps a mind of bodhicitta towards all beings, it doesn't matter what "side" one happens to be on really.

Malcolm wrote:
If you support one side in a war, you accrue all the negative karma of all people who support the killing in that war. It does not matter if you personally never fire a shot.

If you are there merely to treat the wounded of either side, that’s different.

It depends on your understanding the real situation of samsara. If you don't understand— you join in, pick sides, and go to three lower realms. This is called having a one-lifetime view.

Javierfv1212 said:
I'd like to add that its not as black and white as this makes it sound. That is, there are many things a bodhisattva can do during a war besides sit there that does not break the precepts or the injuction to right livelihood.

In fact, any role in a military, government agency or NGO which helps people during a war is admissible for a bodhisattva as long as it does not involve killing, convincing others to kill or lying (for example propaganda and so on) and dealing with weapons (weapons manufacture, research, munitions management, etc).

IMO any of the following roles in the armed forces would be admissible as long as one keeps the precepts: field medic, doctor, cook, chaplain, therapist, disaster relief, etc.

There are probably several roles which are pretty grey area, like transportation (where in some cases you might have to transport weapons and munitions) which I would steer clear from.

And of course one can work for NGOs providing relief and so on.

Even if one is somehow put in a combat role due to circumstances outside of one's control (this is not as rare historically as one might imagine, forced conscription and so on), one could still keep the precepts, just aim and shoot over the heads of the enemy with no intention to harm. Its still a really difficult position to be in of course. Hopefully things don't get that bad in my lifetime that I am forced into a position like this, but it has happened historically (Germany and Soviet Union during WW2 is one example).

Due to these possibilities, bodhisattvas in states which have conscription laws should research the status of Conscientious objectors in their countries and understand how the law works, should the need arise to claim such status.

Great wisdom is present in the body,

present in, but not arising from the body.


Or for example, in Buddhahood, Vimalamitra is quoted as saying:

The ultimate bindu of light,
the size of a mustard seed, arises clearly;
its self-illuminating light exists as round,
immaculate, and beyond the extremes of permanence and
annihilation.

The tīrthika view is held to be as following in the Rangshar:

The view that the cause is permanent holds that there is a substantial
cause in the center of one’s heart center that is round,
white, the size of a bean, does not come from the father, does
not grow through the condition of the mother, and is held to be
permanent.

In Buddhadharma however, the mi zhigs thig le is composed of elements from one's father and mother. This is very clearly described here by Padmasambhava in the Kandro Nyingthig:

[T]o begin with, the material bindu of the father and mother is created by it [vidyā], [they] are inseparable. On the other hand, the kāyas and pristine consciousnesses are a luminous emptiness not established as some kind of entity, and are free of birth and death. But this body created by a cause is perishable. [438] If one thinks there is contradiction with the former characteristic, that has not been understood. Since that critical point of luminous empty vidyā was not recognized, grasping onto that [luminous empty vidyā] produced the five elements, and the material bindu [was produced] from the refined part of those [five elements.

Basically, the Bonpo "tshon gang" is just talking about this, and when it is being discussed from the point of view of Dzogchen practice it is talked about one way, and when being talked about from the point of view of general tantric anatomy, it is discussed another way.

Quotes compiled from collective karma thread

Malcolm wrote:
But dependent origination, when reduced to its essential components, simply means: where there is affliction, there is a cause for action; where there is action there is a cause for suffering; and where there is suffering, there is a condition for further affliction. Without affliction, there is no cause for action; without action, there is no result, suffering.
A Buddhas deeds are not based on afflcition (desire, hatred, and ignorance); they are based on wisdom. Hence, they do not result in suffering.
A buddha's mind stream is conditioned and relative; it is however free of affliction and endowed with omniscience.

Ogyen said:
From this thread
Malcolm wrote:
Dzogchen mainly describes how samsara begins (with an aim to reverse it), but the “mechanics” of samsara are the same: affliction—> action —> suffering —>affliction as infinitum unless one breaks the chain at affliction.

An action always has a result. An affliction does not need to have a result.



Ogyen said:
Two definition questions:

What is the definition (in the context of Dharma) of an affliction?

Malcolm wrote:
A painful mental state, i.e., desire, hatred, and ignorance, or anything that is conducive to a painful mental state, i.e., impure conditioned phenomena.


Ogyen said:
What is the definition (in the context for Dharma) of an action?

Malcolm wrote:
Volition is action, this produces verbal and physical acts.

Ogyen said:
Per the mechanism illustrated in the sequence above, WHY is it that affliction does not need to have a result?

Is it because:
A. As we remain in a state of Vidya we discern what "action" to take from wisdom on how to act (free of affliction?)

B. The "action" is performed without cetana, so its source is wisdom and not ignorance

Malcolm wrote:
Afflictions do not necessarily produce volitions. When we are aware of our afflictive state, we can disengage our minds from actions related towards afflictive objects. This is why we practice śamatha, actually, so that we are aware of our mind's afflictive state. Being aware of our mind's afflictive state is called mindfulness and attention. Being unaware of our mind's afflictive stated is called being mindless and inattentive.

MiphamFan said:
If we are beginners, then our smrti is weak, and will get distracted by thoughts. Samprajnya is the caitasika dharma which "guards" our smrti, as we progress through the nine stages of shamatha, our samprajnya develops and helps redirect our mind-vijnana to the object whenever it wanders more and more quickly, and our smrti also gets stronger, so it doesn't leave the object. Samjna helps us distinguish the object of our shamatha from e.g the feeling of our legs on the meditation seat, the wind etc. Apramada is what makes us care about returning to the object of our shamatha if our samprajnya finds that our mind-vijnana is distracted. So as a rough metaphor, let's say we are using a telescope to look at the moon, we want it to be fixed on the moon, and we have lenses that bring the moon into focus if it loses it, a homing lens on the moon and so on.

So basically all these other caitasika dharmas accompanying smrti are completely normal and even desireable in shamatha. I was under the impression that they were "thoughts" and a sign that my shamatha was still very shallow, but from what I understand now, they are not problems at all. They are not additional objects of mind-vijnana, which is the real problem e.g. a song lyric appearing in my head, and then I go after the song, think about where I last heard it, the life of the singer, and so on. Subtle thoughts about the object are also a problem such as e.g. thinking about where the Buddha statue came from etc and should not be confused with the caitasika dharmas.

The common Western understanding of "mindfulness" in daily life is closer to the Vaibasika/Theravadin idea as opposed to Asanga's definition, and involves applying smrti to each moment of cognition. But aside from that, the same caitasika dharmas also arise and are fine.

Is this correct? This is for shamatha with an object.

However, karma does not form ideologies and philosophies. If you believe this, then you will be forced accept the consequence one's beliefs are predetermined. At best, all one can say that one's  karmic predispositions towards certain ways of thinking one held in past lives may color what religion, if any, one might seek out in this life. And if one does not have a precious human birth with eight freedoms and ten endowments, what does not matter what one believes. One is not going to get out of samsara anytime soon. Given this is so, all these worldly political theories and social systems are irrelevant. It is one's personal actions that determine where one takes rebirth. For nonbuddhists, to the extent which their religious or moral beliefs compel them to engage in positive deeds of body, voice, and mind and avoid negative deeds, to that extent they will take rebirth in higher realms in samsara. But it really does not matter what religious or social beliefs they hold as long as they engage in the ten virtuous actions and avoid the ten nonvirtuous actions. Even so, without having a precious human birth, they are not getting off the train of samsara.

Of course, one of the reasons it is hard for nonbuddhist to get off that train is that they all engage in the mental nonvirtue of ignorance. This also the case for buddhists. If we do not cultivate correct mundane view, then we won't get off the train either.

However:

"By the power of meditation the yogin can have such clear representations that they appear to him almost like the specific forms of the mind of another person, just as deities will bestow grace on a person by appearing in their dreams etc. So even the yogin does not directly grasp another person's mind through his representations. He can be said to know another person's mind only in the sense that the representations which appear in his own mind have the same form as those in another person's mind. therefore yogipratyaksa is called perception only for the sake of convenience."

What you cite here is not even slightly different than what I said. Therefore, one can know another's thoughts, because thoughts have characteristics and so forth, which are perceptible to those who possess the abhijña of knowing the minds of others.

Apprehending the blue vase in another person knows, for such people, is exactly the same as direct perception of a blue vase; first the blueness, etc, of the representation in the mind of another is apprehended, and then it is constructed as the blue vase they have perceived in one's own mind.

Turkey, rebel allies have lost hundreds in Afrin fighting, Erdogan says

ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey and its Syrian rebel allies have lost “hundreds” of fighters in total since the start of a campaign in northwest Syria three months ago, President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday, with the rebels suffering the bulk of the losses.

Turkey and its Free Syrian Army (FSA) allies launched the operation, dubbed “Olive Branch” by Ankara, in January and have since swept the Syrian Kurdish YPG from the Afrin region.

Erdogan has previously threatened to push further east, a move that would ratchet up tension in Syria’s multi-sided conflict.

“Alongside our 56 martyrs, the FSA army had hundreds of martyrs,” Erdogan told Turkey’s NTV in an interview broadcast live.

Turkey sees the YPG as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), considered a terrorist group by the United States and Europe. The PKK has waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey’s largely Kurdish southeast that has left some 40,000 people dead.

The United States has trained and backed the YPG militia in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. That support has infuriated Erdogan and strained ties between Washington and Ankara, both NATO allies and members of the coalition against Islamic State.

Mohammed is not his real name. He asked me not to share personal details, fearing retaliation from the fighters he passes when he walks around his city. I can say only that Mohammed is a Kurd living in Afrin, a city in northern Syria that was held for more than five years by Kurdish-led forces until it was, about three weeks ago, overrun and occupied by the Turkish army and its proxy forces fighting under the umbrella of the Syrian National Army (SNA), formerly known as the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army (FSA).

To be a Kurd in Afrin, once a majority Kurdish city, Mohammed says, is now to find oneself a member of a despised group, suspected of disloyalty, and liable to be robbed, beaten, put to flight, or worse. In its seventh year, the Syrian civil war has seen the warring parties and their foreign sponsors foster and exploit ethnic and sectarian divisions in order to realize their strategic ends. The looting and ethnic cleansing of Afrin by Turkish-backed militias is the latest ugly episode of this grim and cynical logic.

At the same time, Human Rights Watch has documented that armed groups working with Turkish forces are looting and destroying civilian property in the city of Afrin and surrounding villages, exacerbating the plight of civilians there. Turkish forces and non-state armed groups in control of Afrin should halt the looting and hold those responsible for the damage accountable.

Palestinians protested for a fourth Friday along the security fence dividing Gaza from Israel, some of them burning tires, hurling rocks or flying kites with flaming tails in the hope of setting ablaze the fields of Israeli rural communities on the other side. The Israeli military distributed a photograph of one kite with a scrawled swastika.

The military estimated the number of participants at about 3,000 in five locations along the Gaza border, down from at least 30,000 on March 30, when the protest campaign started.

The organization was originally founded to counter American isolationism during World War II, and played a role in pushing the United States to get involved. Formed to confront Nazism, Freedom House expanded its role after World War II, promoting trans-Atlantic partnerships and vehemently opposing McCarthyism.

In 1947, Freedom House urged New York Governor Thomas E. Dewey to create a state university that would “accept all qualified students regardless of race, color or place of habitation.” (Dewey would later sign legislation that created the State University of New York.) This marked the beginning of the role Freedom House would play in the civil rights movements.

Bayard Rustin, the organizer of the March on Washington, served as the chairman of Freedom House’s Executive committee, and was part of the organization throughout the ’70s and ’80s. Also among Freedom House’s leadership was the notable civil rights leader Roy Wilkins, executive director of the NAACP during the critical years of the Civil Rights movement.

As for the first point, Clinton was impeached for perjury and obstruction of justice. The House rightly found him quilty, and he was acquitted on appeal to the Senate. It was, in my opinion, a bad decision. But it is History.

The Democratic Party has no ideological core, unlike the GOP.  They generally only win in recessions and depressions. When people are fat and content, they usually vote in the GOP to cut taxes, a recession inevitably ensues, and the Dems find themselves back in office.

How does it work? A mind which grasps signs is something which can appear to the mind of others.

Astus said:
It is exactly direct perception that cannot happen, as that would mean having the same state of mind. What might be said is that one can conceive a representation of another mind, just as one can see only representations of physical objects.

"[Consciousness] is only said to perceive the minds of others because it is like a mirror in which appear seemingly external objects. It cannot immediately perceive [others' minds]. What it immediately perceives are its own transformations. Therefore, a scripture says, "There is not the slightest dharma that is capable of seizing other dharmas. It is just that when consciousness is born, it appears resembling images and is said to seize things." As with having the minds of others as objects, so with form, etc."

The journey of the Pink Oshun within is about bringing forth the healer within me to assist our community towards healing from our oppression.

Malcolm wrote:
Interbeing is an extension of dependent origination, based on East Asian ideas.

But dependent origination, when reduced to its essential components, simply means: where there is affliction, there is a cause for action; where there is action there is a cause for suffering; and where there is suffering, there is a condition for further affliction. Without affliction, there is no cause for action; without action, there is no result, suffering.

Title: Syria war: The online activists pushing conspiracy theories
Content:
Unknown said:
Inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) are attempting to access the previously rebel-held town of Douma, where medical organisations and rescue workers say President Bashar al-Assad's forces dropped bombs filled with toxic chemicals in an attack on 7 April, killing more than 40 people.

The Syrian government and its key ally, Russia, say the incident was staged. But the US, UK and France - who support the opposition to Mr Assad - say they are confident that chlorine and possibly a nerve agent were used.

Despite the uncertainty about what happened in Douma, a cluster of influential social media activists is certain that it knows what occurred on 7 April.

They've seized on a theory being floated by Russian officials and state-owned media outlets that the attacks were "staged" or were a "false flag" operation, carried out by jihadist groups or spies in order to put the blame on the Assad government and provide a justification for Western intervention.

The group includes activists and people who call themselves "independent journalists", and several have Twitter followings reaching into the tens or hundreds of thousands.

The activists call themselves "anti-war", but as they generally back the Syrian government's military operations against rebel forces seeking to overthrow Mr Assad and Russian air strikes carried out in support, it might be more accurate to describe them as "anti-Western intervention" or "pro-Syrian government".

According to their narrative, international media organisations across the political spectrum, along with human rights organisations, are somehow covertly aligned with Western governments, Saudi Arabia, the Islamic State group and al-Qaeda and taking part in a secretive plot to take over Syria.

...

White Helmets
The Sarah Abdallah account is, according to a recent study by the online research firm Graphika, one of the most influential social media accounts in the online conversation about Syria, and specifically in pushing misinformation about a 2017 chemical weapons attack and the Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are widely known as the "White Helmets".

The White Helmets operate in rebel-held areas. They have been one of the sources that Western media outlets, including the BBC, have quoted about alleged chemical attacks in Syria. With regard to the incident in Douma, the BBC has not been able independently to verify the group's reports.
Graphika chief executive John Kelly says his company's analysis showed distinct patterns emerging.

"When you're looking at these disinformation campaigns, a lot of the same characters show up for every party," he told BBC Trending.
Graphika was commissioned to prepare a report on online chatter by The Syria Campaign, a UK-based advocacy group organisation which campaigns for a democratic future for Syria and supports the White Helmets. The White Helmets have been the subject of two Oscar-nominated documentary films and have been nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize.

Graphika found 20 million messages about the White Helmets, split between tweets in support and in opposition. Among the opponents, Kelly says, Sarah Abdallah was "by far the most influential", followed by Vanessa Beeley.

The firm found that Sarah Abdallah's account was primarily followed by a number of different interest clusters: supporters of pro-Palestinian causes, Russians and Russian allies, white nationalists and those from the extremist alt-right, conservative American Trump supporters, far-right groups in Europe and conspiracy theorists.

These groups were instrumental in making the hashtag #SyriaHoax trend after the chemical weapons attack in the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhoun in April 2017.

That hashtag, pushed by Sarah Abdallah and influential American conservative activists, became a worldwide trend on Twitter. Many of those tweeting it claimed that the chemical weapons attack was faked or a hoax.

Again.  Regardless of what you personally call it, this is a gross misunderstanding of the principle of karma.  There are no "unrelated events" just ignorance and the ability to see or not see them. Everything existing has a causality.  Sometimes causalities meet. Like and intricate outlet systems of rivers.  I may not be responsible for being raped by my stepfather (per previous example) and now my karma is to manage all the sequence of events that comes out of it.

Malcolm wrote:
Just to inject some definition into this discussion: the Buddha, Naḡārjuna, and Vasuabandhu in one voice proclaim, "Karma is volition (cetana) and what proceeds from volition."

Then there is karma vipaka, of which there are three  kinds:  1) the ripened result, 2) the result that corresponds to the cause, and 3) the dominant result.

With respect to the first, the Ratnavali states:

One is born in hell through hatred;
one is born into the preta realm through desire; 
and one is generally born as an animal through confusion.

As for the second:

Due to taking life, life is short.
Due to stealing, one is impoverished.
Due to sexual impropriety, one has enemies. 
Due to lying, one is criticized.
Due to calumny, one is separated from friends. 
Due to harsh words, one hears unpleasantness.
Due to gossip, one’s word has no value. 
Due to greed, one’s hopes will be dashed. 
Due to malice, one will have fear. 
Due to wrong view, one’s view will be bad.

As for the third, the dominant result, Khenpo Ngalo states (and this is all very standard):

The dominant result is said to ripen as the container universe where one is born and lives. For instance, due to taking life, one must be born and live in a bleak region with ravines and so on that are harmful to life. Likewise, due to taking what has not been given, frost and hail will arise, fruit will not form on trees, and famines will arise.

Ogyen said:
If my karma is reallllly bad I might rape back.  If it is really good I might make it my mission to protect children in the world.  My karma has as much to do with the conditions I've cultivated to handle inevitable pain.   Regardless of "who seems at fault", the event placed my being in that time and space and according to previous aspirations and karmic conditions that led me there, and then the choices I have, at the point of needing to take actions, are all based on my awareness (cultivated qualities) that will permit me to decrease or increase suffering as a result of that karma. If I don't know how to manage rape and abuse I might fetishise it as a child and grow up repeating this scenario to others.  If I realize there ARE tools like therapy and meditation and learn all about the cycle of violence, my capacity to learn this is also a karma from cultivated conditions.  My own ignorance is my transparent cage.  You think you have a choice... But much of your choice really is self determined by what qualities you habituate/cultivate.

This is why it is so important to cultivate the positive qualities.  Not because of moral ground, because what you know is how you suffer. The more you integrate, the less any relative event sways you into suffering.

While much about the attack remains unclear, a New York Times review of more than 20 videos of its aftermath, an examination of flight records compiled by citizen observers, and interviews with a dozen residents, medics and rescue workers suggest that during a military push to break the will of Douma’s rebels, pro-government forces dropped charges bearing some kind of chemical compound that suffocated at least 43 people and left many more struggling to breathe.

“You imagine yourself on Judgment Day, and there is death all around you,” said Mr. Hanash, the student. “It was a scene that you don’t want anyone to have to see: old men, women and children screaming and suffering.”

Regardless of the munitions used, the attack worked. Hours later, as rescuers lined up bodies in the street, the rebels agreed to hand over the town and be bused with their families to another rebel-held area.

By socialist bullshit, what I am referring to the kneejerk reaction to paint everything about the US in a negative light. It is characteristic of Socialist Newspapers in this country, who would not last five seconds elsewhere, people like Chomsky, etc. I am happy they voice their perspective because it necessary for them to speak freely so the terrible ideas they sometimes espouse can be torn apart and exposed.

Karma is unerring. While one's birth in more or less fortunate places in samsara is a result of one's past karma, one's future place in samsara is assured by one's actions in this life. Thus, actions due to hatred, desire, and ignorance inevitably take one but one way: down.

Malcolm wrote:
Samadhi/dhyāna is a natural mental factor, we all have it. The problem is that we naturally allow this mental factor to rest on afflictive objects such as HBO, books, video games, etc.

Śamatha practice is the discipline of harnessing our natural predisposition for concentration, and shifting it from afflictive conditioned phenomena to nonafflictive conditioned phenomena, i.e., the phenomena of the path. We do this in order to create a well tilled field for the growth of vipaśyāna. Śamatha ultimately allows us to have mental stability and suppresses afflictive mental factors so that we may eventually give rise to authentic insight into the nature of reality. While it is possible to have vipaśyāna without cultivating śamatha, it is typically quite unstable and lacks the power to effectively eradicate afflictive patterning from our minds.  Therefore, the basis of all practice in Buddhadharma, from Abhidharma to the Great Perfection, is the cultivation of śamatha as a preliminary practice for germination of vipaśyāna.

The same would be true here. I still ask of anyone knows why the Kuten performed this odd ritual, if the Lama really is what she says she is, etc. because that information will help people decide whether to get involved with them.  I think that is something DW does quite well.

I don't think it is conditioning anyone to ask why a Kuten would get involved or indeed a 3 year retreat Lama with decades of Vajrayana practice.  That is not a witch hunt, and on DW I think one of the useful functions members can perform is to point out uncomfortable truths. As you say, people can do as they wish, but many do so having been better informed from reading DW discussions.

I used to 'condition' my hands by punching straw and concrete as a kid, from 'Teach Yourself Karate' (Bruce Tegner?). It would have been better to have a good teacher and guidance to 'condition' my mind. Sometimes, it is a bit like that here, as we see people engaged in things which are pointless, painful or harmful.... Helping them reach a point where they can make a more informed decision is not 'conditioning' them, except to the extent that anyone may read anything and be affected by it. Hopefully, some of the threads here are useful in informing us all, as with the Aro g'Ter one, where your own input was extensive and very useful in enabling those interested to form their own views.

Chemical Weapons Experts Blocked From Site of Syria Attack, Officials Say

LONDON — Western officials accused Syria and Russia on Monday of preventing weapons inspectors from reaching the site of a suspected chemical attack by the Syrian government that led to airstrikes by the United States and its allies over the weekend.

Inspectors from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons arrived in Syria on Saturday, but two days later, they still had not reached Douma, the Damascus suburb where about 70 people were killed in the attack on April 7. Syrian and Russian forces have captured the area from rebels.

The inspectors are going to the scene to take samples and interview people, but “they are currently being prevented from doing so by the regime and the Russians,” Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain said in Parliament on Monday afternoon.

Even as the war in Syria exacts a fearful toll on the ground, discussion of the suspected chemical attack, like so much of the international posturing about the war, was wrapped in a fog of contradiction and confusion. Nations made charges and countercharges, claiming to have damning but secret evidence about each other’s conduct, with Russia in particular spinning an array of theories of varying degrees of plausibility.

Syrian and Russian officials have told the O.P.C.W. team “that there were still pending security issues to be worked out before any deployment could take place,” Ahmet Uzumcu, the organization’s director general, told its executive council on Monday. The meeting was held in private, but the organization released the prepared statements of Mr. Uzumcu and some other officials.

The British delegation to the organization wrote on Twitter: “Russia & Syria have not yet allowed access to Douma. Unfettered access essential. Russia & Syria must cooperate.” Other Western diplomats confirmed that Syria and Russia were impeding the team.

Senior Russian diplomats said it was the United Nations, not Syria or Russia, that had prevented inspectors from entering Douma. “The problem was the absence of the U.N. Secretariat security department’s approval for O.P.C.W. experts to visit Douma,” Sergei A. Ryabkov, deputy foreign minister of Russia, told reporters, according to the news agency Interfax.

A spokesman for the United Nations, Stéphane Dujarric, disputed the Russian explanation. “The U.N. has given them all the necessary clearances,” he said by telephone. “We’re supporting the team as much as we can.”

Later at his regular noon briefing, Mr. Dujarric said of the O.P.C.W. experts: “We’ve not denied them any sort of clearance.”

Mr. Dujarric declined to say whether Secretary General António Guterres would demand that Russia and Syria provide the experts with access to the Douma site. But the spokesman said Mr. Guterres wanted the investigation to move forward “so we can have a full picture of all the facts.”

The O.P.C.W. declined to comment, and did not even say whether its inspectors had reached Douma, saying in a statement, “We are unable to share operational details.”

The United States ambassador to the organization said at the meeting on Monday that Russia could be trying to conceal evidence of chemical weapons.

“It is our understanding the Russians may have visited the attack site,” the ambassador, Kenneth D. Ward, said. “We are concerned they may have tampered with it with the intent of thwarting the efforts of the O.P.C.W. fact-finding mission to conduct an effective investigation.”

In an interview with the BBC, Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister, said, “I can guarantee that Russia has not tampered with the site.”

The United States and its allies Britain and France used missiles on Saturday to strike targets in Syria that they said had been involved in producing chemical weapons, which President Bashar al-Assad’s government denies having used.

Even before the O.P.C.W. inspectors arrived in Syria, the Western allies said they had ample evidence that the country had dropped a chemical agent on Douma, and that it had used chemical weapons many times during the seven-year civil war.

East-West tensions have been high since Britain accused Russia of using a powerful nerve agent to poison a Russian former spy living in England and his daughter. The Kremlin has denied the accusation, which set off the expulsion of hundreds of diplomats and a series of economic measures against Russia.

“It is the style of today’s London to blame Moscow for everything and ascribe certain actions to which we bear no relation whatsoever,” Mr. Ryabkov said.

Russian and Syrian officials have suggested that the chemical attack in Douma never occurred, or that it was staged by rebel forces or Western powers as an excuse for attacking Syria. Mr. Lavrov accused Britain of playing a part in the alleged ruse.

The Syrian military, with help from its Russian and Iranian allies, this month retook control of eastern Ghouta, a suburban area that was the last major rebel-held enclave near Damascus. Douma was the last part of the region to fall."

The Nazis did.  I don't know if the Communists would have done this had they gained power, but I know the Nazis did.  So...

And Stalin did not abandon Greece.  The Greek Communist Party was being supplied with weapons and support via Yugoslavia, when Tito broke off ties with the USSR and sided with Mao, the supply route through Yugoslavia was cut off.  You could ask:  Why did they not continue to supply the Greek Communist Party through Bulgaria?  Well, because Bulgaria and Greece were involved in a war with each other since Greece was expelling the Bulgarian Nazi collaborationist government from Greek territories.  Don't forget that Bulgaria did not join the Eastern Bloc until after 1946.  We also have to remember that Bulgaria and Russia never got on well, not even before the East-West divide, which is why they sided with Germany in both World Wars.  And Greece and Bulgaria had been at conflict since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire.  By the time Stalin sold out Greece, the situation was beyond redemption anyway.

Hard right?  That is an understatement!  A government composed of Nazi collaborators!  The British then brought in a Bavarian based royal family and ruled Greece via them for 3 years, before the far-right (Amerikan backed) military junta took over power for 6 years.  Let us also not forget Britain's role in the invasion and (ongoing) partition of Cyprus.

And even before all of this there was the Italian Fascist attempted invasion and occupation (finally pulled off with help from their friends the German Nazis).  And the German Nazi occupation which (together with the Italians and Bulgarians) lead to the largest number of Greek deaths in modern history (barring the liberation from the Ottoman Empire and the subsequent displacement of Greeks from Asia Minor): around 70,000 people were executed.  That figure does not include the number of Greeks that died during the enforced starvation during the occupation (around 50,000 dead).

As you can see, the only major European power that Greece does not have a (direct) issue with is France.

You really do have the strangest way of putting things. How can a Buddha manifest as the personification of delusion and self-grasping? As a general rule, anything or person that offers a distraction from the three trainings of the path— discipline (ṡīla), one-pointed concentration (samadhi), and wisdom (prajñā) — can also be regarded as a personification of Mara. Thus, how can a buddha offer distractions from the path of awakening? For what possible reason?

Any entity which manifests through a trance medium and claims to be either a buddha or an āryabodhisattva is necessarily a māra, and further, anyone who claims an entity who manifests through a trance medium is a buddha or āryabodhisattva is either mistaken due to ignorance or is deluded.

Tsongkhapa fan will bring up the fact that Tsongkhapa seems to have used two mediums in his career: a Nyingmapa Lama through whom he had a conversation with Vajrapani to remove his doubts about Dzogchen teachings; and Lama Umapa, through whom he had conversations with Mañjuśrī and clarified his doubts about Madhyamaka. Frankly, in my reading of these accounts, it actually appears that it was on account of Tsongkhapa's own pure vision that he perceived these masters as Vajrapani and Mañjuśrī, since the former was someone whose main practice was Vajrapani Maṇḍalacakra, and the latter was someone whose main practice was Vajrabhairava, respectively. However, the way that Khedrupje composed the secret bio of Tsongkhapa, it is made to appear as if Tsongkhapa relied on Umapa as a sku rten, a trance medium, and this is surely a mistake. There is no fault at all in having pure vision of one's master as this bodhisattva or that, or even as Buddha Vajradhara in person. But there is a very great fault in suggesting that buddhas and bodhisattvas on the stages resort to trance mediums to speak the Dharma.

cyril said:
I imagine that, if Buddhas emanate into the preta realm, they would do so in a form able to communicate Dharma to the pretas. I therefore assume that such a preta nirmanakaya would actually manifest as a preta just like Buddhas manifested in the human realm in the form of human nirmanakayas. I also imagine that such a preta nirmanakaya would possess all the physical abilities of a regular, non-enlightened preta in the same way Sakyamuni, Padmasambhava, Garab Dorje were capable of doing all the normal physical actions of a non-enlightened human being. Now, if this line of reasoning is correct, it follows that a preta nirmanakaya should also be able to possess mediums and oracles, just like non-enlightened spirits do. But since the general consensus is that such thing does not happen, I wonder what is wrong with the reasoning above.

Malcolm wrote:
Jvalamukha teaches the Dharma to pretas in their own form. Śākyamuni Buddha teaches Dharma to humans in their own form, etc. Also, this doctrine is very specific to the mandala of peaceful and wrathful deities, and should not be confused with the Buddha's actual career. The Buddha himself, during his sojourn in this world, appeared in the hell realms to beings there, and also the deva realms to the beings there.

As mentioned above, the mode of teachings of the Buddha has been ascertained to be three and three only: the vacana of his own voice, blessed vacana, and permitted vacana, and no fourth kind has ever been mentioned or ascertained such as vacana through trance mediums, channelers, tarot cards, seances, and so on. This is distinct from the Tibetan custom of the using trance mediums of reliable, mundane entities such as Nechung, Tseringma, and so on for oracular predictions about worldly matters.

The invocation of āryas such as Mañjuśrī, Śrī Devi, and so on for divinations must be understood as an invocation of their blessing, not their presence through mediums — thus it is completely different and must not be confused with the possession of trance mediums by worldly spirits.

Can someone explain coherently and with valid reasons why a Buddha cannot speak through another living being?

There is the classic example of the Heart Sutra being delivered by Buddha through Avalokiteshvara, for example. This is an example of Guru Yoga.

If a worldly spirit can communicate through an oracle - in other words, if such a spirit can enter their body - then it goes without saying that Buddhas can do so too. Buddhas are not limited beings, their speech has extraordinary qualities that cannot be understood by ordinary beings. Their words can be heard as the sound of the wind through trees, from Buddha's ushnisha and in the Pure Land, even the birds make the sound of Dharma, so why isn't it possible for a Buddha to communicate through another living being?

Malcolm wrote:
Indeed the Buddha gives teachings in three ways: directly with his own voice, by blessing, or by permission.

However, there isn't a single example in the sūtras or tantras where the Buddha gives teachings by literally possessing and then speaking through the body of another being in the manner of being a channelled entity. Further, these three modes of teaching were confined to the duration during which the Buddha was physically present in his nirmanakāya in this world, 2500 years ago. For this reason, apart from teachings of the sambhogkāya revealed by the mahāsiddhas of India and Tibet, there have been no new Dharmas in the world since then.

You might suppose, "In the world other buddhas have arisen, albeit not supreme nirmanakāyas, what is to prevent them from possessing the bodies of others and speaking through them."

1) No more than three modes of the Buddha's granting teachings have been identified in the sūtras by the paṇḍitas of India and Tibet. 2) There is no example in sūtra or tantra of such an occurrence, in other words, there is not a single example of Buddha giving teachings through a medium (sku rten).  3) Since the Buddha's nirmanakāya is no longer present in the world, also the three kinds of teachings are complete. 4) Among the beings the Buddha blessed or permitted to teach Dharma, it is only āryaśrāvakas and āryabodhisattvas who received such blessing or permission. 5) By inference, worldly devas and humans are not proper vehicles to be given permission to speak for the Buddha via blessing and permission since there is no example of Buddha giving such worldly people blessing or permission to speak for him. 6) Māra can appear in any guise, including that of a buddha or a bodhisattva, so it is unsound to consider the utterances of trance mediums to be valid Dharma. How is one to determine whether such teachings have a valid source or not?  We have already seen the negative effects in Tibet of mistaking worldly entities who possess mediums as buddhas.

Therefore, the idea that buddhas can speak through trance mediums must be utterly rejected both because it is an irrational supposition and because if it is accepted that such a phenomena is valid, many distorted teachings will enter the world, as is already the case with respect to those insufficiently wise to avoid such spurious teachings.

The underlying issue - well, one of the many underlying issue - is that for decades, the loosely-defined 'coalition' hasn't had a clear, consistently-pursued strategy that lasted more than a few months. This goes back at least as far as GHB's bait-and-switch in 1991 with the Iraqis, but frankly that was just the continuation of a pattern of behavior dating back to before WWII. US/UK/EU governments have been consistently unable to decide what they want, partly because they are politicians and their voters have never bothered to understand the situation enough to decide what *they* want. This is never going to change. We at least know what 45 wants, which is a new shiny little distraction from the dumpster fire which is his domestic administration. But he's not really that much worse than his predecessors. One doesn't need conspiracy theories when there is ample evidence of collective idiocy.

If the article had said "a living oracle, and an emanation of Mamaki" (note the added comma), it would not have been subject to the interpretation that she was channeling Mamaki, which is an absurdity on many levels. As has been noted many times on this forum, the title "emanation" is tossed about pretty carelessly, and being recognized as an oracle is not that weird or unusual in Asia, and perhaps in Africa either (I don't know anything about Yoruba culture).

If her work is channeling human energies in a positive direction, and she's not just a money-grubbing charlatan, then that work deserves to be recognized, just as the spirit that animates Nechung is to be honored for major contributions to Tibet's and HH's welfare.

There is a huge difference between manifesting THROUGH oracles and manifesting AS AN oracle.  A Buddha can manifest as or emanate anything.  Therefore, there is no reason why a Buddha cannot manifest or emanate an oracle.

As to "fully enlightened Buddhas CANNOT manifest through oracles", I think this makes no sense.  I think a Buddha can do that if he/she wants to but that would be unskillful and unnecessary.  Unskillful because it would create a precedence for any medium to claim that he/she is channeling a Buddha (I actually met a medium who claimed to be channeling Buddha Amitabha) and unnecessary because a Buddha can manifest as anything, so he/she can manifest as an oracle to deliver a message instead of going through an oracle to deliver a message.

What does this statement even mean?  Couldn't one say (wn the yogacara approach, it seems to me, and I am open to correction, the two truths are not reconciled. There is a leap between the two lower levels of understanding and the perfected understanding which sees emptiness, ie. only the ultimate truth of the two truths; all dharmas, whether false or dependently originated, are not the ultimate truth.

Malcolm wrote:
No, this is not correct. The absence of the imputed nature in the dependent nature is the perfected nature.

The two truths are reconciled in Yogacara through the dependent nature.

In other words, the dependent nature is the hinge for the relative and the ultimate, samsara and nirvana, etc.

The main difference between standard Madhyamaka, where one perceives that a given entity has two natures, and the Yogācāra three natures, is that first, all given entities are reduced to mind-only, that recognition of mind-only is the transition point to recognizing that they exist only as seeds in the ālayavijñāna (the dependent nature); through recognizing that they do not existas  anything other seeds, one is no longer confused about the imagined nature (relative truth), recognizing that the dependent is empty of the imagined itself is ultimate truth. The main  problem with Yogācāra is that they are unable to account for how a conditioned consciousness transforms into unconditioned jñāna, hence Yogācāra is held by Madhyamaka to be a realist school.

When one's analysis fails to find something, one discovers the absence of inherent (a.k.a ultimate) existence, otherwise known as the absence of existence with respect to any of the four extremes. This analysis is not endless, since one only needs to discover the emptiness of one thing to realize the emptiness of all things. To echo Āryadeva, those who propose any sort of existence must prove the existence of each and everything they propose as existent, whereas those who make arguments via emptiness need only to prove the emptiness of one thing in order to prove the emptiness of all things.

dear climb-up,

if you're looking for a one-size-fits all methodology in vajrayana, i think you're going to be disappointed. as the well-known tibetan saying goes, "every valley has its lama; every lama has his dharma (meaning how he or she does things)."

personally,  i recommend your finding (or sticking with) a teacher whose teachings work for you and not worry about the rest. if ChNNR's method of DI or initiation works for some, that's wonderful for them. others may need (or simply favor) in-the-flesh teachings in a small group setting. the issue is the result, not necessarily the delivery system.

just my two cents. sorry if i'm way off base.

climb-up said:
Thank you for your thoughtful post. I appreciate it.

I am not looking for a one-size fits all approach, nor am I looking for a teacher who works for me, I have found that in ChNN's teachings and practice. I'm good on that front, and have full faith in teachings.

My question was specifically in regards to Malcolm, a very well known and vocal supporter of ChNN and his teachings saying that everything in the article was correct. I can understand both approaches being true in the "every lama has his own dharma" sense, but not in the sense of a student of ChNN saying that everything in there article is true.
I am curious if Malcolm has some understanding that some how reconciles these two perspectives and, if he would share it. I am (very genuinely) not trying to start any sh!t ...

Are aspirations mentioned in Dzogchen literature, or does it rely on the natural compassion doing its business? Wish-fulfilling jewel a and wish-fulfilling jewel b have no differences in activities and potentialities, surely?

Each deity manifests from separate aspirations to provide methods for different sentient beings. Tārā the bodhisattva and Tārā, the deity in the sadhana that one manifests are not the same, but by doing the latter one invokes the aspirations of the former. However, if one realizes Tārā, there is basically no difference at that point between oneself and Tārā because the pristine consciousness of all the buddhas is identical in terms of object of realization and so on.

There are some very good answers and sources here, which I think address the point (and thank you for them ).

Actually the whole distinction between ‘conventional and ultimate’ is really a deep philosophical question.

The problem with identifying any "thing" with the Original Buddha is that the Original Buddha is not a "thing". If it is, then we have to make clear that we mean this only in a conventional sense. Otherwise, we're not discussing Buddhism and rather something else.

In the sutra I reproduced ( https://dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f=53&t=28193 ) The Original Buddha is identified as "no mind, no thought". I didn't reproduce Swanson's comments, but he suggested that this Original Buddha of No Mind and No Thought is jisso - True Aspect of Reality. The suggestion is that the beginningless and endless original Buddha that awakens, awakens by "hearing" the teaching of the True Aspect of Reality, in other words, coming to know reality as it is by observing reality.

I don't know if this is meant to be understood as some temporal event, or rather implies that the practitioner should likewise seek awakening by listening to the True Aspect of Reality.

As for identifying this myoho renge kyo with the True Aspect of Reality, that's probably partially true. It is also the wisdom (in the form of the Buddha) of the True Aspect, as well as the practice of it.

In other words, I don't think that sutra aligns particularly well with what Nichiren taught.

No, it is not like that at all. The statement is pointing out the consequence of what would happen if 7.5 billion people overnight stopped raising livestock for food. Of course that is not going to happen, since I do not foresee, in world of 2.5 billion Christians, 1.8 billion Muslims, etc., that the demand for meat is going to decrease anytime soon. In fact, it will only increase as we move deeper into the Kaliyuga.

pueraeternus said:
It would not be so bad if there were no such thing as modern factory farming practices. But in the face of what we know what goes on in meat factories, people continue to spout Buddhist doctrines that do not factor these realities in.

Malcolm wrote:
You apparently selectively ignored my agreement that modern agribusiness in toto is terrible. For the record, I do not buy meat or dairy that is not pastured, i.e. raised humanely, and preferably locally, since I have that luxury. Nor do I buy nonorganic food as much as possible.

On the other hand, the world appetite for meat is increasing as developing countries increase the demand for meat every year.

The FAO projected:

pueraeternus said:
Meat consumption in developing countries has been continuously increasing from a modest average annual per capita consumption of 10 kg in the 1960s to 26 kg in 2000 and will reach 37 kg around the year 2030 according to FAO projections. This forecast suggests that in a few decades, developing countries’ consumption of meat will move towards that of developed countries where meat consumption remains stagnant at a high level.

Malcolm wrote:
http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ai407e/AI407E02.htm

In reality, more and more people are going to be eating meat. The trends are pretty clear:

pueraeternus said:
Thanks to all of this meat eating, at any given point in the year, there are 19 billion chickens, 1.5 billion cows, 1 billion pigs and 1 billion sheep on the planet — more than three times the number of people. And these numbers are set to rise as the human population grows and more people shift toward a meat-based diet. The number of cattle, sheep, goats and buffalo — animals that require quite a bit of land for feed production and grazing — alone is increasing by 25 million annually, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization.

It is as if just because technically they may not be incurring direct karmic penalties, they will be alright. But we are all supposed to be on the Mahayana path, and it is not enough to just not further incur negative karma - we have to actively bring benefit for others. It is truly the age of kaliyuga when supposedly learned practitioners can't see the obvious contradictions.

Malcolm wrote:
You seem to have a misunderstanding of the bodhisattva path. Shantideva raises the question of how the Buddha could have perfected generosity since there was still poverty in the world. Shantideva responds to the qualm by pointing out that even though the Bodhisattva could not actually relieve the poverty of all sentient beings, he sincerely wished they were all free of it, and thus he perfected generosity. You also seem not to make a distinction between aspirational bodhicitta and engaged bodhicitta.

One must disentangle what impacts one's liberation, and what impacts the world. There is really no way to prevent the transient suffering of sentient beings. The view that one can is really a one-lifetime view at best. That is why the Buddha clearly stated, "I cannot remove suffering with my hands." Mature Dharma practitioners know with sadness there is really nothing that can be done about the suffering of others, even though we make aspirational vows to lead all beings to nirvana, in order for that to happen, those sentient beings need to be reborn as human beings first. This is why, for example, when training on the four Brahma-viharas, Kamalashila recommends that we first develop equanimity. The lack of equanimity on the part vegetarian ideologues is basically what fuels their idealistic "compassion."

pueraeternus said:
And I am not even now saying everyone should suddenly be vegetarian - just accept the fact that reducing meat intake is good for every sentient being involved (including insects, since we will be killing less of them), the environment and planetary well-being, and then try to reduce meat in our daily life. Even this they do not accept and give all sorts of spurious reasons and denials. There is no other way to say it - it is disgusting and shameful.

Malcolm wrote:
Your feelings of disgust and shame are your own since you are imputing positions upon me that I do not hold.

Frankly, a lot of Western Buddhist hysteria over the consumption of meat comes from living in advanced economies where being a vegetarian is a first world luxury. A point completely overlooked in these debates is that most Buddhists in the world, living in developing nations as they do, eat meat and want to eat meat. Actually, so do most Hindus, they just avoid beef, eating lamb and chicken in great quantity instead. And Hindus would not dream of abandoning milk, etc., since it is sanctioned in the Vedas.

It is pretty clear there is suffering in the world. But the only way suffering can be removed in a real sense is by meeting the Dharma and practicing a path. In the meantime, I will seek to help those I can directly help, and feel sadness at my limitations in not being able to help all sentient beings, even though that is my most sincere wish.

Yet vegetarianism isn't about being self-centered. Focusing on your own liberation, your own purity or your own karma, is by definition, a self-centered focus. Vegetarianism is the opposite of self-centered.

The idea that omnivores are less compassionate than vegetarians is entirely fallacious.

The social conditions of India were such at the time that in order to attract converts to Buddhism, vegetarianism was encouraged. Today we have precisely the opposite conditions, at least in the US. Here, the vast majority of people eat meat. Insisting on vegetarianism will simply cause many people to have no interest in the Dharma. When Buddhism spread to Tibet, the majority of people did and still do eat meat, and thus, Indian Buddhists did not insist on vegetarianism understanding that Tibetans would reject them. Insisting that Buddhists be vegetarian is Devadatta's doctrine, as has been pointed out before. The Buddha understood that we have to work with circumstances. Insisting that others must follow one's own dietary conscience is in fact contrary to the Dharma. One can certainly be a compassionate person and also be an omnivore.

So by supporting those companies, you support the exact same group of people who also provides meat to people, and you have no control over where your money goes (it could be for the installment of a new slaughter house, you never know).

The only way to truly avoid these things is to grow your own food, but then you run into the dilemma of killing sentient beings when you till the soil, and having to protect your crops later on, etc...

Extensive cattle ranching is the number one culprit of deforestation in virtually every Amazon country, and it accounts for 80% of current deforestation (Nepstad et al. 2008).

With respect to the Buddha's teaching in Mahāyāna on eating meat, if we are to judge things by their commonality in the Mahāyāna sūtras, the question of meat eating does not come up very frequently, and and the prohibitions on consuming meat are exclusively found in sūtras considered by the Madhyamaka tradition to be of provisional meaning such as the Lanka, the tathāgatagarbha sūtras, and some lower tantras.

A text I have brought up before in this thread, the Blaze of Reasoning ( Tarkajvala ), a comprehensive Madhyamaka commentary, addresses various objections to meat-eating found in these sūtras, such as the claim that eating meat will make the body impure. Bhavya points out, for example, that the body is already impure by nature, thus eating meat will not make it more so. He points out a number of other inconsistencies in these sūtras as well. He does so to point out that the prohibition on consuming meat is not a definitive teaching, but is interpretable.

Hi,

I just want to put it out there that I strongly believe this seminar is an occasion not to be missed. We have the rare opportunity to dive into one of the oldest texts that gives a comprehensive commentary to the Dzogchen tantras; and what's even better is we will have the chance to learn from someone who knows the language precisely and can give an accurate presentation of what is being explained in this sublime text. I have met Acarya Malcolm in person and I can say without a doubt that he has clarified a lot of the confusion I had. Anyways I just wanted to share that because I think this is important.

So by your logic there is no need to avoid products made by child labor, or fair trade, or companies that indulges in abominable practices. If we can't even activate ourselves to lessen the monstrous slavery and killing of sentient beings we can clearly see their suffering, then what kind of Bodhisattvas are we? Why use the excuse of insects and worms to continue encouraging the abominable factory farming practices? Even if there is still the problem of sentient beings dying in the farming process, we can at least reduce the deaths and hellish lives of billions of livestock, not even talking about the reduction of said insect death by reducing the need to grow feed for the livestock. And of course since we are at it, let's discount the fact that reducing livestock is one of the key elements in slowing down climate change due to the enormous amount of methane gas byproduct and massive loss of vegetation to support that industry.

Malcolm wrote:
These issues are distinct from what is permissible or prohibited to practitioners. Liberation through diet and clothes was not something the Buddha taught.

As to the hellish lives of billions of livestock, humanity has shown that animals that we use are more immune to extinction than those for which we find no use at all.

If and when we cease to use domestic animals for food, their very population will swiftly decline. This may indeed be a desiderata for some.

I also know that karma is unerring and that all that suffering is a result of karma.

This is a completely different issue from whether or not there should be abattoirs at all.

However, as long as we live in societies dominated by non-buddhists there will always be meat readily available. Thus, eating meat or not is a personal choice entirely unrelated to karma as long as one does not order, see, or know that animal was killed specifically for oneself, as in ordering a lobster and unlike ordering a streak.

The difference is that what pervades phenomena is not buddhas. Emptiness is that which pervades phenomena, in other words, all phenomena are empty.

When we say pervades, we mean that all phenomena are similarly empty, just as all fires are similarly hot. It is not that there is one emptiness without a second that pervades all phenomena. And even emptiness is just a convention.

It seems that in YY the asanas are arranged and linked into vinyasas and that also that they are coordinated closely with pranayama, and with an emphasis on ujjayi. Krishnamacharya's approach to asana and pranayama seems very similar, although conceptually and spiritually he was basing himself in Yoga Sutra. It seems like academic consensus now is that Krishnamacharya was deeply influenced by European physical culture, but I always wondered if he was influenced by trulkor and tsa lung as well.

Well, let's take it one aspect at a time. I think there are 2 aspects to this:

1. Is he correct that the original Pali in the Jivaka Sutta did not contain the 'slaughtered for oneself' qualifying clause, and are there contemporary Sanskrit texts which support or undermine this assumption?

Malcolm wrote:
This paper undermines the assertion of your friend: http://dharmafarer.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/43.4-Majjhima-Jivaka-S-m55-piya.pdf

2.  How does that apply to the Three Vows and those who practice according to them - is the vipaka going to be different for each of the three?

Malcolm wrote:
The consumption of meat is permitted for ṥrāvakas; forbidden for bodhisattvas, and permitted for those who practice inner tantras (but prohibited for those who follow outer tantras).

Mantrik said:
Well, it depends on one's perspective. If you regard the 3 Vows as applicable to different and to some extent (containing) discrete forms of Buddhism, one may argue that those Hinayana monastic rules are only appplicable to them. If however, you regard all later forms as revisions and developments of an original set of (Pali) teachings, then you are more likely to form the view that they also amended things in an 'attempt to justify their appetite for the flesh and blood of animals'.

Malcolm wrote:
The three vows are related to the path that one follows. The higher vow transforms the lower vow. Thus śrāvakas are absolutely forbidden from handling money, owning property, killing sentient beings, and drinking alcohol. Bodhisattvas may handle money, own property, and even kill sentient beings, if warranted and drink alcohol, but are prohibited from eating meat. Practitioners of inner tantras are permitted to handle money, own property, kill sentient beings if warranted, drink alcohol, and eat meat.

Mantrik said:
Another perspective on this from a Jonangpa Lama friend:

''In an attempt to justify their appetite for the flesh and blood of animals, some individuals allege that the Buddha permitted the consumption of meat under three conditions. This is a patently specious claim.

The Pali text of the Jivaka Sutta, the putative source of the infamous ‘three purities’ argument, states:

“I say that there are three instances in which meat should not be eaten: when it is seen, heard, or suspected. I say that meat should not be eaten in those three instances.

“I say that there are three instances in which meat may be eaten: when it is not seen, not heard, and not suspected. I say that meat may be eaten in these three instances.”

Clearly, the Buddha is stipulating here that if a monk inadvertently consumes meat that has been placed in his begging bowl, he is not at fault. His action is pure. However, if he sees, hears, or even suspects that there is animal flesh in his bowl, he must not eat it.

Later commentators gratuitously inserted the phrase “that the living being has been slaughtered for oneself” after each repetition of the word ‘suspected’. The phrase does not appear in the original Pali text. It is a spurious addition, making it seem as if the Buddha allowed his monks to eat meat when the animal was not expressly killed to feed them, or at least when they did not see, hear, or suspect it.''

Malcolm wrote:
This is a mistaken point of view. It is not correct at all. Your Jonang Lama friend needs to read Sapan's Three Vows as well as Bhavaviveka's perspective on the issue. Of course, Madhyamakas in general regard Tathāgatagarbha sutras as provisional as well.

Here is my interpretation of what you are saying that Tsongkhapa was saying.  Correct me if I am wrong:
(1) Existence that is free from the extremes of eternalism and nihilism refutes existence in the ultimate (i.e. eternalism and nihilism).
(2) Non-existence of eternalism and nihilism refutes non-existence in the relative.

In other words, in (1), when you examine phenomena, they look like endless continuums from past to the future.  This refutes that kind of existence that are eternalism or nihilism.  In (2) Since the forms of existence as represented by eternalism and nihilism do not exist, it refutes these kinds of existence in the relative.  The kind of existence in the relative is therefore a form of existence that is neither eternalism nor nihilism.

The general scholarly consensus is that they borrowed many Buddhist teachings and recast them into a narrative reflecting Tibetan cultural debts to Zhang Zhung and Central Asia, rather than India. Naturally, Bonpos in general dispute the latter claim and claim on the contrary that Indian Buddhism is ultimately derived from Bon, similar to the way Taoists claimed that the Buddha was a student of Lao Tzu.

The Bonpos preserve a lot of lore important to understanding many Tibetan religious ideas that do not derive necessarily from India, China, or other sources.

The Buddhas are those who have eliminated all their confusion so that they are able to use their potentials fully to benefit others. On the definitive level, the safe direction of the Buddhas is provided by their dharmakaya or bodies encompassing everything - namely, their omniscient awareness and its nature, both of which encompass everything.

Since a Buddha’s subtlest wind and subtlest clear light mind have the same essential nature (ngo-bo gcig), a Buddha’s subtlest wind also pervades all phenomena – for example, all phenomena that are forms of physical phenomena (gzugs, Skt, rupa, form). This is similar to space (nam-mkha’) pervading all forms of physical phenomena. Taking the four elements – earth, water, fire, and wind – of some form of physical phenomena, such as the table, as a basis for imputation (gdags-gzhi), we can impute not only space on that basis, but also the person (gang-zag) of a Buddha.

But since the referent object of the labeling (btags-chos) and the basis for imputation are not the same, then just as the table is not the space of the table, so too the Buddha that we meditate on as being imputed on the basis of the table is not the table. Thus, we can meditate on the Buddha as being imputed on everything and everywhere, but that does not make Buddha identical to the universe or Buddha as being the size of the universe. Thus, the Buddhist assertion of a Buddha’s omniscient mind pervading the universe is not equivalent to the non-Buddhist Samkhya and Vaisheshika assertions of persons (skyes-bu, Skt. purusha) or “souls” (bdag, Skt. atman; selves) pervading the universe and being static, partless, and existing independently of a body or mind.

So is there vipaka if you purchase meat from a farmer or a company who you know will put some of that money into further killing of which it is probable you will also purchase in the future?

Isn't any support of another's actions still support?

Malcolm wrote:
If you make this argument, let's say you buy a tomato from a grocer.  And that grocer also sells meat, milk, cheese, etc., all products that require killing (cows have to be impregnated and with calves to make milk). If you take seriously this reasoning you have presented, you have to accept that spending any money at a grocers is "support."

I suggest that there are two issues, which are unrelated to one another. One concerns the ethics of animal husbandry over humanitarian and environmental issues. This is a valid discussion on its own merits. It is demonstrable that industrial agriculture is toxic and bad for the environment in general. It is demonstrable that the conditions of the animals in Concentrated Animal Feed Operations (CAFO) are dreadful.

The second, and the one that concerns us here, is to what extent we bear a karmic burden if we eat meat or participate in an economy in which this practice of eating meat is present. And what, if any impact meat eating has on our path. The latter issue is resolved via an examination of three vows. Analyzed this way, meat is permissible for śrāvakas, forbidden for Mahāyanīs, and permissible for those who practice Niruttarayogatantra (but not practitioner of the three lower tantras).

Here is my interpretation of what you are saying that Tsongkhapa was saying.  Correct me if I am wrong:
(1) Existence that is free from the extremes of eternalism and nihilism refutes existence in the ultimate (i.e. eternalism and nihilism).
(2) Non-existence of eternalism and nihilism refutes non-existence in the relative.

In other words, in (1), when you examine phenomena, they look like endless continuums from past to the future.  This refutes that kind of existence that are eternalism or nihilism.  In (2) Since the forms of existence as represented by eternalism and nihilism do not exist, it refutes these kinds of existence in the relative.  The kind of existence in the relative is therefore a form of existence that is neither eternalism nor nihilism.

Tashi delek.   

As a TCM practitioner, i am involved on a regular base with Taiosm principles like Yin and Yang. The Pa kua is a fundamental part used in one of the 5 Chinese classical Chings, the I Ching the book of oracles. 
 
Here it is clear that the Pa Kua is very old and has as well in TCM as Bon so its own history with nice examples.

What is very similar in both cultures is the turtle as the source of the Pa Kua.
Further interesting philosophy regarding Taoism would be the prime cause or the Wu Chi out of everything is originated.

That resembles very much the emptiness aspect known in Dzogchen etc.

kirtu said:
I'm stunned.  BTW - Taoism is essentialist, at least in the interpretation of my former Taoist teacher (and presumably his teacher).  Essentialist in this case means something close to atmanistic if not directly atmanistic (because along the way to enlightenment in Taoism the spirit is basically an essential element and it is further developmend usimg a kind of spiritual alchemny).

Anyway, that Bon also has an interpretation of Bagua is stunning and fascinating.

kalden yungdrung said:
Tashi delek K,

Yes it is stunning and i asked one very educated Geshela today about the source of the Pa Kua / Ba gua and he assured me it was a teaching of Buddha Tönpa Shenrab Miwoche.

We have also a Chinese "Kung Fu" style Pa Kua which is a certain style which is stepped in circle patterns, with a certain palm technic which goes round. Practised this for a short time in my youth, never finished it.



Then we can consider that the story of the turtle is also known in Taoism as well the "founder" of that,  the Medicine man dressed in herbal leaves, forgot his name. Would be around 3000 - 5000 B.Chr.

The I Ching is one of the best divination books i know and it was my first book together with the Tibetan book of the dying.
Here the 64 signs or trigrams can predict for me every situation and it never fails in the right prediction.
The person who likes to know, throws my 3 blessed silver coins and i tell the person what he/she will meet/experience etc.
I Ching never was wrong and the persons who consulted me know that the hexagram "knew" the question .
The answer was always to the point and never mistaken and i could give always the right story, cannot explain that, it goes automatic.

So the Pa Kua is a very powerful  tool to predict and it never fails to do so, based on my 49 years experience with this I Ching.
Therefore i can believe it that the Pa Kua is used also elsewhere, like in China and i can imagine myself that the Pa Kua is of Bön origin.
Ok here we can have different meanings, but i am convinced that Bön was spread to China and Uddhiyana.

if the Pa Kua would be Chinese of origin, then the Kalachakra Tantra would also be a mixed up Tantra somehow and that is what i do not believe.

I think we all have to wrestle with the complexities of these issues..even when they appear to be clear cut.  So, for example, you say that the insects are not intentionally killed in order to provide vegetables and fruit Mantrik.
I'm sorry but they are.
All commercial crops of vegetables, fruits and grains are treated with substances to kill insects. If they are grown on an organic farm they will be treated with Bordeaux mixture or nicotine or something similar.. which pass the criteria needed for the produce to be considered organic. But whose express useage is to kill invertebrates which otherwise will reduce yields considerably, in some cases the yield will be reduced to zero.
Obviously many invertebrates are killed unintentionally in order to produce food plants..but many others are killed with conscious intention.
Without organic insecticides, few brassicas would make it to the shops, due to caterpillars, and few potatoes would be free of wireworm.
What Situ R. et al are saying is that we in the west subconsciously assume that the life of a  caterpillar is worth less than the life of a cow.  Largely because they are smaller. But a caterpillar avoids painful stimuli just as avidly as does a cow or sheep.

Mantrik said:
Can we clarify the aspect of karma and vipaka here?

If I participate in the process of planned meat production by ordering a whole carcass (as Simon gave as an example) I am pretty sure of my intention and that the animal was killed 'for me'.  So my karma in ordering it is directly connected to the suffering, pain and death. It is absolutely connected if I kill the being whilst hunting of course.

Malcolm wrote:
Depends on whether one orders a carcass before or after it was killed. If was killed on your order, then you own that karma and its ripening. If not, then not.

Mantrik said:
If I buy meat, I can be sure the store will plan future slaughter on the basis of the demand I create with others who eat their meat.  (The Olympics, for example, have huge breeding and slaughter plans based on previous demand at events.)  So my karma in buying it is, at best, indirectly linked to killing. If I order the meat from a farm, for example, then it is as the first example, directly connected.

If I eat veg and fruit, some beings are killed in the process. However, and this is a big however, I did not plan to identify specific beings and knowingly kill them or order their deaths. I did not round them up and spray them or slice them up with a plough, they just happened to be there. So, is my action considered 'complete'?

Malcolm wrote:
You can be certain that all the food you buy involves harming sentient beings, and that in creating more demand for more food, you will be harming more sentient beings.

You cause suffering just by wearing clothes. Cotton, for example, is one of the most pesticide-heavy crops there is. When wool is sheared, millions of creatures are sliced in half, not to mention the suffering of the sheep.

Malcolm wrote:
You mean is there one book that demonstrates this? No, but it is obvious when one reads through Tibetan history that Dzogchen was a very poorly kept secret for something so reserved, esoteric, and only for the elect. Dzogchen masters like Rigzin Godem had thousands of students, same with many popular tertons like Jatson Nying, Dudul Dorje, Jigme Lingpa, etc. For something so secret, it is amazing there is more literature on Dzogchen in Tibetan literature than any other tantric genre. I mean, if Dzogchen is so secret, how is it possible that 100,000 monks at Kathog attained rainbow body, as the story goes? Kathog was the earliest Nyimgma monastery, founded in the 12th century by Deshek Dampa, Phamgo Drukpa's younger brother.

That equals 100 monks a year for the past thousand years attaining rainbow body, 8.3 per month— one rainbow body every 3.6 days for the past thousand years!

Hello,

I know that Tantra speaks about the unity of conventional and ultimate truth or the feature of there being the unity of this in one act of consciousness but I am uncertain if this is something that runs through all of Tantra or if it something that comes into play only during a specific phase. For example, if you are practicing the generation stage with the visualization of the deity and the mantra repetition besides merely focusing on the deity or the mantra do you try to have the two aspects unified or is it something that will only occur in a specific section of the practice?

Thank you.

Malcolm wrote:
When you are a beginner, you generally practice the two stages, creation (relative) and completion (ultimate), in stages. But the real intention is that the two stages be unified from the beginning.

The "logic" of Madhyamaka is in its consistency and internal justifications. Ultimately it is working with what is essentially a "illogical" proposition. Depending on how one views "logical", the entire Buddhadharma is illogical.

You are confusing the Madhyamaka analysis of causal series, neither the same nor different, with the four extreme. This is the basis of most of your errors.

The reasoning why "not existent and not nonexistent" is rejected is because there are some who proposed that existents, while arising, have a phase where they are not existent and not nonexistent.

Madhyamaka arguments are not formal proofs in logic. They are rebuttals of other's positions.

Take the opening statement of MMK:

At no time, no where,
does any thing arise from (1) itself,
(2) from other than itself,
(3) from both, or (4) without a cause.

The first extreme is existence, arising from self; the second extreme is nonexistence, arising from other; the third extreme is both, arising from self and other; the final extreme is without cause, neither existence nor nonexistence.

All four extremes must be refuted. There is no short cut around this.

Thank you very much Malcolm. Truly extraordinary. How long did it take you to translate the whole text? Must have been a few days.

BTW, if anyone has lack of funds but has the requirements to read this text, please let me know. I will pay for three sets and shipping for those who can't afford it. It would be best if that was in the US as shipping overseas gets very expensive but let me know and I can see what I can do.

Malcolm wrote:
The initial draft of the Rangdrol took about three months, finished in Dec 2011, and subsequently, five drafts.

The initial draft of the Rangshar took about 6-7 months, that was completed in October 2012. It subsequently went through six drafts.

Then, after a hiatus where we worked on Buddhahood (originally translated over three months in the fall of 2012) to tighten up our lexicon, we returned to editing the Rangshar and Rangdrol which we envisioned publishing together.

After Wisdom agreed to publish this work, frankly due to the success of Buddhahood, I spent six months researching and writing essays to support the text, only 25 percent of which actually made it into these two volumes. In addition, the work altogether went through five rounds of editing with one of Wisdom's senior editors, Laura Cunningham. Wisdom had an expert in Sanskrit, Rory Lindsey, review all of the Sanskrit terms in the text for proper diacritics and accuracy, and it was proofread by Emily Bower, who used to be an editor at Shambhala but now works freelance. Right now it is being indexed, and all final changes will be implemented in April. So, from start to finish, this project will have taken eight years. Amazing. When I began to translate these two texts, I had no idea it would wind up this way.

We commissioned Tashi Mannox to do calligraphy for the two volumes. We also commissioned an original line image for Bhagavan Pawo Zhonnu Tobden, the teacher of both tantras, drawn according to how he is depicted in the Vima Nyinthig's Great Chronicle by a thangka painter, Urgyen Gyalpo, who lives and works in Toronto.  The cover design was done by Gopa Campbell. The interior book design also is based on Gopa Campbell's original interior design for Buddhahood, but was executed by Wisdom's inhouse designer, Lyndsay D'Andrea.

Tulku Dakpa RInpoche and Jean Luc Achard (a leading western authority on Dzogchen) kindly wrote forwards for the book. In addition, Sangye Khandro has expressed amazing kindness in giving her support to our efforts, and there are a couple of other translators who have kindly agreed to lend their support, but until they actually send us their blurbs, they should remain anonymous for now. Credit is also due to the original sponsors of the Rangdrol.

It is really amazing how many hands touched this book to bring it to completion. It has my name on it, but in reality it was a huge team effort. We owe a great debt to Daniel Aitken for his vision in seeing the possibility of bringing our work to the reading public.

At present Team Zangthal is working on volumes three, four, and five of the series. Volume three has been submitted, the Without Syllables and its commentary. We are editing drafts of volume four, the Blazing Lamp and its commentary, and I have begun work on volume five, the Six Dimensions and its commentary. (And all of this does not count all the other translation work I have been involved with over the past 7 years.)

Arnoud, your offer is very generous, thank you.

The exceptional features of each of the seventeen tantras of Ati Yoga’s quintessential secret cycle of the upadeśa class are described with metaphors.

In the second watch of the night the Buddha awakened, he attained the second knowledge, which is most relevant here:
"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, & attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away & reappearance of beings. I saw — by means of the divine eye, purified & surpassing the human — beings passing away & re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior & superior, beautiful & ugly, fortunate & unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings — who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech & mind, who reviled noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views — with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings — who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, & mind, who did not revile noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views — with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus — by means of the divine eye, purified & surpassing the human — I saw beings passing away & re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior & superior, beautiful & ugly, fortunate & unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.

While still on this topic of logic, another place where we disagree is this: whether there is two extremes or four extremes.  I hold that when the two extremes of eternalism and nihilism are properly defined, there is no need for two of the extremes in the four extremes: the extreme of <eternalism AND nihilism> would be incoherent; the extreme of NOT <eternalism OR nihilism> would be indeterminate, which is say that anything that belongs to this set cannot be ascertained.

There are four extremes because there are opponents who adhere to each of the four extremes, such as yourself, who adhere to the fourth extreme, neither existent nor nonexistent, as your post above shows.

The whole first half of the Lotus Sutra (which I must point out, contrary to your characterization, is not mine) is a series of predictions for the arhats.

This does present a serious question about the Buddha's ability to predict the future, and is something that I've considered. I have no idea what to make of it, as I don't know what to make of most of this.

But, I say this - such predictions are problematic because on their own logic, this would mean all time is static, and we only float along the surface observing, like watching a movie. One can readily see the problem with that sort of fatalism.

Malcolm wrote:
I amended by post above, but will reproduce that here, "Since his omniscience transcends time, objects, etc., his omniscience of the future does not indicate determinism, his omniscience can handle all possibilities for all phenomena simultaneously."

Queequeg said:
The only way that the predictions to the arhats make sense is if they are therapeutic in nature, correcting the theirmistaken view that arhatship is the real end, and that the real end the Buddha teaches is something else. And this would be consistent with the explanation of upaya in the sutra, and consistent with what I observe of reality, which is that it is dynamic and not determined.

Malcolm wrote:
Or, that the Buddha's omniscience transcends the three times, etc., and is unimpeded.

Knowledge of the three times, even unbounded knowledge, implicitly means that it only extends to what is knowable. Is the future known to the Buddha in all its detail? There's something of the Wizard of Oz quality to such a view.

Not just my opinion. It is also explained quite well in your preferred sūtra in chapter 5. In chapter 5 the Buddha states:

I fully know the present world and the other world just as it truly is with correct discerning wisdom. (I am) omniscient and all seeing. Devas and humans come before me in order to hear the Dharma! I show the path, expound the path, know the path, and am the one skilled in the path.

The corresponding passage in the BDK version is at the top of the page 96.

This chapter leaves no room for your assumption that the Buddha does not know everything about the path, nor what practices are suited for every sentient being.

With respect to terma, both systems are based on Kama, as are all valid treasure revelations. With respect to Tsongkhapa, he did not actually invent some new set of teachings, he organized lineages he had received into a system of teachings, with a special emphasis on the father tantras. Some of his students got into polemical quibbles over matters of interpretation, but if you go to a Gelug initiation and then a Sakya initiation, and then a Kagyu initiation, you won't notice much difference, because the procedures governing how empowerments are bestowed were set down in India, and have not been altered by Tibetans extensively. Potential novelties introduced by Tibetans are addressed in such polemical works as Sapan's Three Vows, and the responses to it that it continues to earn to the present day. You should read it in order to understand the issues we are addressing.

It was along the lines of "we don't need to limit ourselves to one tradition, and we can take the best parts of many traditions as it helps us in our practice and daily life".

Lineage is the most important thing in Vajrayāna because the practice in general involves initiation into various mandalas, and the procedure must be like impressing a seal in wax.
Although this I haven't really heard about actually happening - except perhaps by Yogi Chen - if the method and transmission is left intact, any Vajrayana practice could be incorporated into another system, like in Tendai, could it not? Tantric rituals are still present in Chinese Buddhism, just as they were there in Zen in Japan before the 18th century reformations.

Malcolm wrote:
Tendai practitioners can practice Vajrayāna providing they follow Vajrayāna rules. The same goes for any Buddhist of any tradition. If they want to practice Vajrayāna, they must do so in a precise way, placing the guru as the head of all refuges, and guarding their samaya carefully. But once you have joined Vajrayāna teachings, you won't really be a Tendai, etc., practitioner anymore.

Sherab said:
Anymore more such assertions and I would begin to think that you are trolling me:
What was the logical argument that I made? You said "even ultimate truth is merely a conventional truth" Call this statement 1. You also said, "An ultimate truth is the veridical perception of a given entity, a relative truth is the non-veridical perception of a given entity. " Call this statement 2.

Statement 1 can be represented as U -> C, where U = ultimate truth and C = conventional truth
Statement 2 can be represented as U = V, R = not V, where V = veridical perception of a given entity.
Substituting 2 into 1 gives V -> not V, which is incoherent.

Anyone with an understanding of logic will tell you that the argument above is logically correct. Whether the argument is valid or not depends then on whether the premises, statements 1 & 2, are true. If we take your premises as true, than the argument is true and you have an incoherent conclusion. So one of your premises must be false. I would suggest that Statement 1 is false, namely that the ultimate truth is merely a conventional truth. I have already stated before that I thought that saying the ultimate truth is merely a conventional truth is to over negate. It is my view that the incoherence from over-negation implies the undermining of the possibility of knowing what reality is, a consequence that I tried to argue in an earlier post. In other words, when you negate the ultimate to such an extent that it reduces the ultimate to the convention, and since the convention excludes veridical perception, that veridical perception that is necessary for knowing the ultimate is excluded as well.

Refute the above argument if you can. If not, do not make wild allegations of misrepresentation of your position as it only serves to diminish your status.

I answered this in many ways, but the most expressive is that there simply is no reality beneath things. There is nothing to find. Not even something free from two extremes. Therefore, ultimate truth, emptiness, is a conventional truth, because it is effective at bringing about liberation.

Your attempt to reduce it to a formal proposition via western logic is a fools errand. Richardson already attempted this, and when he reduced Madhyamaka to statements in formal logic, he found they were incoherent. But he also missed the point of Madhyamaka, and the two truths.

I understand what you wrote, as above, I think you are suffering from lack of understanding the what the two truths actually are, which causes you to adopt a transcendentalist/realist position with respect to the two truths. For you, the ultimate is something free from the two extremes. For me, ultimate truth is merely the perception of the absence of inherent existence/four extremes in entities which arise from conditions. Among the emptinesses Candra lists, for example, is the emptiness of the ultimate:

Because it is the supreme necessity, 
the ultimate is nirvana, 
Whatever is the emptiness of that
is the emptiness of the ultimate.

The knower of the ultimate
taught the emptiness of the ultimate 
in order to avert the grasping 
of the thought that nirvana is real.

And:

Whatever is not an extreme
is described as transcending extremes;
since that is empty of itself, 
it is conventionally the emptiness of the transcended extremes.


Now, the question for you is, is ultimate empty? Of what is it empty? If the ultimate is also empty, how can be it any thing other than a conventional truth?

And since you are fond of citing the two extremes, if freedom from extremes is empty, how can it be anything other than a conventional truth?

Since everything from matter to omniscience is empty, how can they be anything other than conventional truths? A true ultimate truth would not be empty, now would it?

You think the ultimate is something independent which can be uncovered. It isn't. The only thing that is an ultimate truth in Buddhadharma is emptiness, and that ultimate truth is also merely a conventional truth.

one cannot randomly use one completion method given in one system with that of another system

Astus said:
But one can use them systematically, like what is itself a combination of different methods from all three systems: the six dharmas of Naropa.

Malcolm wrote:
Suppose you are a Lamdre practitioner, this does not automatically allow you practice the six dharmas of Naropa (Naro chos drug). There is a specific transmission for this which you must receive from a lineage holder, and which is normally practiced on the basis of the creation stage of Vajravārāhī. True, the various of the six dharmas are derived from different tantras, but if you don't have that specific transmission, you cannot practice it.

Further, even if you have received the six Dharmas of Naropa and Lamdre, you cannot mix the two. I.e. you would not apply the Six Dharmas to Lamdre, nor would you apply Lamdre to the Six Dharmas. The basis of these distinctions is lineage of transmission.

Further, you would not apply the practice of Atiyoga to Sarma traditions. In the Tibetan tradition, we maintain very strict boundaries around transmissions, and mixing tranmissions is considered be a personal fabrication. When you are practicing Lamdre, you practice Lamdre, when you are practicing Naro Chödruk, you practice Narochödruk. You don't mix. For example, in Sakya, there is Naropa's Khechari, but it is considered extremely bad form to mix Naro Chodruk with Naro Khachö, the completion stage for the latter is entirely dissimilar from the former, and has its own special transmissions and requirements.


Astus said:
And if one has learnt different techniques from different teachers, it is quite normal to practise them, from which comes a person who can then teach such previously diverse techniques as a single set.

Malcolm wrote:
No, this is mixing lineages. If you want to teach Naro Chodruk, then you do so based on the constraints of that transmission. For example, even if you have received Hevajra in a Kagyu tradition, this does not grant you permission to practice Hevajra in Sakya — the visualizations are different, the sadhanas are arranged differently, the oral instructions are different, and so on.

Astus said:
Isn't that rather the usual situation, while knowing only one technique and having a single teacher is fairly rare?

Malcolm wrote:
The usual situation is that when a teacher, holding multiple lineages of the same deity, for example, Hevajra, gives an empowerment of Hevajra, they do it according to one specific tradition, and do not mix other traditions in that transmission.

For example, let us say you are a Karma Kagyu who practices Shangpa as well. The six dharmas of Niguma are basically identical to the Naro Chodruk, however, in the Shangpa system, each yoga has a separate empowerment, and cannot be practiced with that empowerment, according to the dictates of the lineage. Naro Chodruk however, has a transmission, but does not have separate empowerments for each of the six, Hence, when teaching Shangpa, a Karma Kagyu teacher will respect the Shangpa tradition very precisely, and follow that system. When teaching Karma Kagyu Naro Chodruk, they will do it according to that school.

This is how we roll in Vajrayāna. If you mix systems, it is considered very bad. The point is to understand how each system agrees with the others in terms of meaning, but practice just that system without mixing other elements into it from other lineages. Even when you have broad heterogeneous systems like Lamdre, which assembles its practice out of nine separate upadesha transmissions, one does not just add the Naro Chodruk system to make a tenth. That is very bad, not allowed, and the Dharmapālas of both systems will become unhappy and punish the offender.

As for translators following precedents, they do it all the time. At the translators conference, I ever heard Thubten Jinpa opine we should follow older, incorrect translation equivalents merely because they are in use and have become standard.

As before, I made allowance for commentarial drift in Chinese from the Sanskrit for this passage. But even so, when you are citing some passage, you have to make sure that it is acceptable to both parties, otherwise it is a failure right from the start.

Vajryāna does in fact mean a specific method: creation stage and completion stage, which themselves depends on empowerment.

Astus said:
Is there anything in Vajrayana that could not be categorised under those two stages? If no, are all creation and completion stage practices equal? If no, why call it a specific method, when they are actually large categories of numerous methods?

Malcolm wrote:
All deities in highest yoga tantra possess two stages.

The procedures of creation differ very little from one to another. They all generally possess the five abhisambodhis and the four limbs of approach and accomplishment.

Completion stage practices vary quite a bit more, but one cannot randomly use one completion method given in one system with that of another system since the transmission lineages are different, as well as the specific tantric system to which any given deity might belong, that is, father tantra, mother, tantra or nondual tantra, and that influences what kind if completion stage practice one engages in. However, there are some completion methods that are universal, like vajra recitation.

In sum, the method of Vajrayāna is the two stages and everything is included in those two.

Astus said:
Furthermore, what would not allow someone to practise first a sadhana of Tara, then contemplate on Joshu's Mu, and finish off with observing the disgusting nature of the body?

Malcolm wrote:
What people do in their own caves is their own business, but I have never heard Vajrayāna master teach Joshu's mu. It isn't needed.

As to observing that the body is disgusting, this contemplation cannot be performed by Vajrayāna (HYT) practitioners at all. People in kriya, cārya, and yoga tantra, on the other hand, can practice that contemplation since there is no vow of maintaining pure perception of the body 24/7/365.

Yes. They all follow Hurvitz, who in turn follows Kern.

Queequeg said:
Do you really think so little of these translators?

Malcolm wrote:
I just know what the Sanskrit and Tibetan say, and that Kern, someone with little knowledge of Buddhism, got this passage in particular wrong, and up to the present, the Kern translation has been regarded as the standard reference translation from Sanskrit. Thus, errors in Kern's presentation have unfortunately been enshrined and continuously repeated in every translation to the present since they were perpetuated by Hurvitz in his 1976 translation.

Sorry for being a pain in the ass and checking English translations of passages against Sanskrit and Tibetan before accepting them as scripture. I guess I shouldn't do that again, someone might get offended.

Queequeg said:
Where do you get this? You're speculating about the translation methods.

Malcolm wrote:
Nope, it is pretty clear. Scholars, like judges, tend to follow precedents.

Queequeg said:
It has nothing to really do with the Sanskrit original, which presents a different issue, but how Kumarajiva rendered the passage in Chinese. The question is how the Chinese reads.

Malcolm wrote:
I allowed for commentarial variation above.

Queequeg said:
The translators after Hurvitz' knew the weaknesses of his translation and we're careful about that, among them, he rather uncritically considered the Sanskrit version Kern translated as coming from a close recension to the one Kumarajiva translated. This has been established to not be the case. He also relied too much on Kern.



Malcolm wrote:
It is unlikely there was any drift for the passage in question among the differing Sanskrit recensions. According to https://www.scribd.com/doc/284915735/Saddharma-Pundarika-Sutra-Dr-P-L-Vaidya, the Kumarajiva recension closely resembles the Tibetan translation. Hence my contention that people translating the text are just relying on precedent. And in fact, Kern may be deferring to Burnouf's earlier French rendering. I don't read French, so I cannot be certain of this.

Queequeg said:
The fact is the recent translators have looked at the text with fresh eyes and have tried to render the Chinese as written. That's why this passage reads very differently in the several recent translations. In all of them, the Buddha explains he responds to conditions.

Malcolm wrote:
Actually, I have checked several translations for this specific passage, and they all basically say the same thing (Reeves, Threefold, BDK, Watson) in virtually identical language with respect to this passage.

Queequeg said:
This point about response not being just some thoughtless act is explained throughout the text in the examples of the fathers who, in response to conditions, try one thing without success and then contrive another to save their children.

I'm not really interested in a minute debate about the nature of the Buddha as presented in the Lotus Sutra. You have made clear you have your ideas about it and have preconceived notions that the text doesn't mean what it reads.

Malcolm wrote:
In fact, I have far less preconceived notions of the text than you, since it is not that important in our tradition. Nevertheless, when cited as scripture, is appropriate to check the citation.

The translation of the passage you cite simply is not that rigorous and stands on long, though erroneous, precedent. The Buddha simply is not asking himself a question in this passage. The word kathaṃ can be an interrogative, but more often than not, as reflected in the Tibetan translation, means "by all means."

Again this is why Madhyamika is dialectical, i.e. a dialogue between two poles 'is' and 'is not'. Something becomes clear from that understanding of 'neither is nor is not'. Whereas what we're always naturally inclined to do, is to hold to one side or another. That is what makes Madhyamika dynamic, i.e. it's not a fixed view regarding 'what is', but an understanding of the conditioned nature of objects of perception and of the perceiver.

That is what you think.  And you think that what you think is correct.  Such hubris, and coming from one who does not wish to confront the logical incoherence of his position when pointed out.  That is precisely why no progress can be made in this discussion.

Go back and re-read the thread and you will not find anywhere where I claim that there is an ineffable absolute.  I repeat, I made the claim that there is an ultimate.  You are equating that the ultimate I claim is equivalent to an ineffable absolute.  You have been repeating this claim so many times, despite my disputing your claim each time.  I am beginning to think that you are hoping that by making the claim often enough, it will stick and allow you to win the argument.  That would be consistent with your unwillingness to confront the logical incoherence in your position.  This is not something that I expect from someone of your standing.  It is truly disappointing.

Malcolm wrote:
An ineffable ultimate isn't the slightest bit different from an ineffable absolute. "Ultimate" and "absolute" are synonyms.

BTW, I guess you believe if you crow about my "logical inconherence" long enough, someone will believe you.

The long and short of it is, the only incoherence here is your position that there is some sort of ineffable, independent ultimate in Buddhism. There isn't. Emptiness is also empty.
