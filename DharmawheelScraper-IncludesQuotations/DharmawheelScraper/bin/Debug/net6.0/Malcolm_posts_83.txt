The nature of things is "non-dual", simply meaning free from existence and non-existence. Great, now one knows this. Then what? How are you going to use this fact? How do you integrate this into your practice? Better not do so conceptually, since that will just result in taking rebirth as a formless realm god.

The purpose of emptiness is to cure views. Emptiness is not a view. "Non-duality" is a view. That is why Vimalakirti kept his trap shut.

Baizhang Huaihai opined that it was a most efficient gateway for clarifying the way, of course the Vimalakirti Nirdesha devotes a fair few words to the topic. But I see it more as a useful tool in regards to ironing out hidden conceptualisations than as ontological schematic. For the latter it usage is quickly exhausted.

gregkavarnos said:
Excuse my ignorance!

So you are saying that the "ultimate Dhamma" mentioned in the Dhammapada quote is, in the dhatu categorisation scheme, the dharmadhatu?  It seems to make sense but the commentary to the Sutta quoted by TM states: Thus it seems more this discourse's discussion of "All" is meant to limit the use of the word "all" throughout the Buddha's teachings to the six sense spheres and their objects. As the following discourse shows, this would also include the consciousness, contact, and feelings connected with the sense spheres and their objects. Nibbana would lie outside of the word, "all." This would fit in with another point made several times in the Canon: that dispassion is the highest of all dhammas (Iti 90), while the arahant has gone beyond even dispassion (Sn 4.6; Sn 4.10).
Thus Nibbana IS beyond the "All" and incapable of expression or perception at the relative level.

This seems to be contradictory, because isn't the dharmadhatu the source of all phenomena:  Relative and Ultimate?

So either we are steeped in (or ultimately are) dharmadhatu and thus, being inseperable from it, we can perceive the Ultimate which also arises from dharmadhatu (when the veil of ignorance is lifted) or phenomena are seperate to the dharmadhatu and thus have no contact with the ultimate.  But, then again, I guess if I take the Middle Path approach then this contradiction will be erased.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, that may be how Theravadins approach that sutta -- but some tendencies in Theravada are slightly eternalist. We also have that Sutra in the Agamas, and the way the twelve āyatanas are described by Vasubandhu and the way I have outlined this is completely normal and consistent with that sutra. Nirvana, for stream enterers and so on, is an object of their consciousnesses since it is included in the dharmāyatana/dhātu.

There are no phenomena that lie outside the twelve āyatanas.

Malcolm wrote:
No, actually it does. The Sabbasutta is just a description of the twelve āyatanas. The twelve āyatanas contain all conditioned and unconditioned phenomena, including the supreme Dharma, nirvana.

The twelve āyatanas:
eye | form
ear | sound
nose | scent
tongue | tastes
body | tactiles
mind | dharmas

That is it. There are no phenomena taught in any buddhist teachings that can go beyond this list. The dharma āyatana contains the aggregates of sensation, ideation and formations (vedanasamjñā̄saṃskaraskandha), as well as space and the two kinds of cessation. When the twelve āyatanas are broken out in to the eighteen dhātus, the dharma āyatana changes its name to the dharmadhātu. Mano āyatana, the mind ayatanā is the aggregate of consciousness, vijñāna skandha, and the ten material āyatanas, eye, form, etc, are the rūpaskandha.

I personally know one bhiksuni who says she has received direct teachings from Bodhisattvas before. She doesn't advertise this or generally tell people about it, but being a friend and fellow Buddhist she revealed to me some exquisite poetry written in Classical Chinese verse which she claimed was transmitted to her through Bodhisattvas. It all contained references to Buddhist concepts and having a background in Classical Chinese I found it impressive.

So this is not necessarily an issue of canons, but at times a matter of experience. Those who have visions of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas need not be convinced of their existence. They already have direct teachings and take them as seriously as they would any canonical text. It is not really uncommon for high-calibre practitioners to have such visions. You might have difficulty meeting them and hearing about their experiences though.

I'm considering starting a FB interfaith group on capitalism and how to reform it from an American perspective.  Marxism formed a useful critique of capitalism and it's exploitations (although I far prefer Dickens) but the resulting solutions usually brought misery to the world.  The sole successful counter to capitalism, social democracy, cannot be adopted in it's European form in the US.

Capitalism has become the central ideology in the US.  However the pursuit of profit without recourse to it's moral and social effects is an actual evil.  Socialists and labor activists in the US in the 20's-40's did form an effective criticism of capitalism and did have some influence on introducing humanizing reforms to the US labor environment.  However socialism as a political force was eliminated and labor itself became corrupted.  More recently some religious groups have been present during anti-globalization and esp. anti-war protests but as these have become dominated by starkly materialist organizations like ANSWER most of these religious groups have not made their voices heard on an ongoing basis.

This interfaith group will address these issues and attempt to reform capitalism so that it can become a force for good in society rather than mindless profit.

What should such a group be called?  What should it's guiding principles be, etc?

Therefore, I think "emptiness as non-duality" is pretty trivial. Like a rock, a stone. It is just there -- nothing worth getting excited about. Well, you could get excited about a rock or a stone, but not because it is empty. You get excited about it because it is useful for something. could help some sick person, could be tied to the end of rope and used as a anchor, etc. But its emptiness is not that exciting or that interesting. Neither is the emptiness of all phenomena in general. Now, the wisdom that intuits the emptiness of persons and phenomena and burns away afflictions, that is a little more exciting. But on its own, non-dual emptiness is trivial and totally uninteresting.

Yes, I can agree with that. But it's still not like a living being's evolution as certain teachings can not just go extinct but resurrect too, not to mentioned cases when one teaching is integrated into another and thus lives on as part of a bigger organism from what later it can break off. So much for applying biology to Buddhism. Whether dependent origination is what to be identified as the core, well, if that equals for instance the "tolerance of no-birth", "seeing the nature" and "unity of samsara and nirvana" than sure.

Dependent origination is exactly the meaning of non-arising -- Manjushri states in PP sutras "Whatever arises dependently, just that does not arise in truth."

Extensive or condensed It matter not so long as good conduct is kept for focusing the mind.

Perhapes it should just be common courtesy to treat anyone who abides by morale discipline with respect regardless of what ones views are on how many vows there should or should not be afterall the basis of friendship is having a respect for one and other.

People you are talking about won't care one way or another what they are called. But Bhikshus are the ambassadors of Shakyamuni Buddha.

The true practice of Dzogchen is based on wisdom. The nine yānas is based on mind. That is the basic difference.

This is not my idea, magnus. This is what is explained in many Dzogchen texts and upadeshas. Moreover, this is also explained by our mutual master, Norbu Rinpoche.

We can speculate all we like.

But there are some salient points to bear in mind. It was not imagined by Mahāyānists that there were persistent oral lineages of Mahāyāna teachings in Jambudvipa.

Quite the contrary. Mahāyāna is the original treasure tradition. Mahāyānists came to believe that their texts had been laid away for four centuries or more and then revealed by such masters as Nāgārjuna and so on, kept by Bodhisattvas such as Mañjuśrī for safe keeping until the time was right for them again to be promulgated. Therefore, any honest person whose mind is not clouded by the delusion of religious zeal and fervor has to admit that it is unlikely that the detailed and highly complex literary compositions which we now know as Mahāyāna sūtras could not possibly have been composed in any thing other than a visionary manner at a much later time than their purported setting. Moreover, they would have to admit that these detailed literary compositions, (even as early as the Digha Nikāya), betray evidence of extensive editing and development over many centuries, as is proven by the layers of such texts in Chinese translation. For example, the Maitreya Chapter, so important to gzhan stong exegesis, is completely missing in Chinese sources, proving that it was a Yogacara addition to the PP corpus.

Pema Rigdzin said:
You make a good case, and what you say is probably the most likely explanation. Since we've already established that these texts' provenance is beside the point (aside from the enlightened nature of that source), my continued participation here is just for the sake of it being interesting to me and because I may learn new things as I continue to probe.

With that in mind... It was my understanding that the PP sutras were rediscovered by Nagarjuna, and Maitreya's five treatises were kind of like pure vision teachings received by Asanga, etc., but are all of the Mahayana sutras said to have come to us in a similar way? Were none said to have come to us in a long lineage from the Buddha (a la kama)? If there are cases where a "kama" lineage of certain Mahayana sutras is claimed traditionally, is it not possible that the historical teachings spoken of in these sutras did in fact take place, were faithfully transcribed and hidden, and later edited and added to throughout the centuries following their rediscovery? Again, I acknowledge that it really doesn't matter, but I am curious.

Malcolm wrote:
It is highly unlikely.

No Pali suttas of which I am aware are so highly self-referential, making constant references to worshipping themselves in book form, or constant references to the doctrine they contain, or defensive remarks about criticizing their contents. In other words, the Agamas and Nikayas seem to lack any anxiety at all; whereas Mahāyāna sūtras seem to be filled with anxious polemics about their authenticity.

This anxiety that is so noticeable in early Mahāyāna texts begins to vanish when India authors, copying a strategy of the Theravada Abhidhamma pitika authors, hit on the strategy of ultimately siting the original source of Mahāyāna sūtras in the person of Tathāgata Vairocana in Akaniṣṭha Gandavyuha.

Now freed form the spatio-temporal constraints of Kapilavastu, Rajagriha, etc., and utilizing docetic strategies of transmission (the three kāyas), these texts were now immune to hermeneutical critiques of authenticity based on their composition as texts ultimately voiced by Shakyamuni located within the lifetime and career of Shakyamuni. Shakyamuni's role, in India, as the proponent of Mahāyāna was subordinated to that of Vairocana. Shakyamuni-as-nirmanakāya now appears more as a shepherd of the Dharma, rather than its ultimate source. There are many other threads one can work out from this basic premise.

This did not happen without some dissenting backlash, of course i.e. the Saddharmapundarika can be seen as a reaction to this firm trend, with the ultimate result that in India the Saddharmapundarika was completely sidelined since it did not fit into the innovative Yogacara docetic model of sūtra transmission with the sambhogakāya acting as an intermediary between the dharmakāya and the nirmanakāya.

Yogacara doceticism is a vital key also in the composition and dissemination of Vajrayana. Now, freed utterly from the dictates of the career of Gautama, Buddhist authors/mystics could fearlessly compose tantras free of concern about their historicity. The only evidence of anxiety in the tantras is that they would fall into improper hands.

The Agamas, Vaipulya-sūtras, and tantras should be seen as a successive record of the religious experiences of people who attained awakening in some measure, starting with The Buddha. When the main themes of Indian compositional strategies in Mahāyāna had been set down, these themes adopted to compose original sūtras in Chinese, Tibetan, Khotanese, etc. These themes of composition were so strong, so compelling, that even nominally non-buddhist peoples such as Bonpos adopted them hook, line and sinker, developing a religion in Tibet that is virtually indistinguishable from Tibetan Buddhism other than details of narrative origin, and used these narrative strategies to express their own spiritual evolution.

I am a firm believer in evolution. I personally think that Buddhism is a religion that underwent and is undergoing significant evolution, reaching its high point in the teachings of the great perfection, and adapting itself to various cultures in an evolutionary manner according to the environment in which it found itself.

The reason Buddhism was able to undergo this evolution without it's core being destroyed, but rather revealed and expressed with greater and greater clarity as successive generations of buddhas refined its essential message, is that the essence of the dharma is dependent origination.

Ok, said enough, now have to get back to work.

I should think that by now, having been here from its days of infancy, under two profiles (the other one given a funeral ) until now, Dharma Wheel perhaps has attained some sort of maturity (I believe we do have Ordained members in here) to have a forum of its own on Ordination.

If not mistaken, when Ordination comes to mind in the Mahayana/Vajrayana contexts, one is looking at:
a. the monastic and non-monastic systems (Dharmagupta/Mulasarvastivada and Bodhisattva/Tantric Vows/Precepts)
b. the East Asian Mahayana and its affiliates, the Japanese and its affiliates, the Tibetan Vajrayana and its affiliates

Then, this Forum should be an avenue to discuss and exchange ideas on:
a. Ordination
i. General discussions (typical Q&As, specifics on robes, fake monastics, customs/protocol of the Ordained and etc)
ii. The Experiential (from the fully Ordained to those who participated in short term monastic retreats and those who disrobed)
iii. Legal/Administrative issues (e.g when ordaining in a foreign country or when foreigners ordain in one's country)

b. Resources on Ordination

What do you think Admin/Mods/Members?
The above suggestions are not exhaustive and ideas are welcomed to improve and enhance further.

What you mean is the Yogacara teaching of the five gotras, and it is not relevant to the question here.

Namdrol,

Yes, there were some Hinayana schools, the Mahasamghikas for instance, who had some concept of other buddhas. So maybe this problem never occurred in India or anywhere else. Still, in the agamas/nikayas there is no sign of other buddhas and those are the texts said to be preached for the sravakas. Consequently, since in the Mahayana sutras sravakas are also present, they should have known about other buddhas.

Pema Rigdzin said:
Haha sorry, what I wrote about the five gotras was just the set-up to my main point which I obviously forgot to make... however, now in light of my reflection upon what Namdrol has suggested, I have to rethink the point I was going to make. Maybe he's right, which doesn't matter because as he mentioned, the liberating power of the Mahayana sutras is in their Dharma, not their supposed historicity. But I'd like to look further into this for myself, and hopefully it'll be stimulating convo for others as well. So, before I abandon the possibility that the Mahayana sutras did indeed literally fall off the lips of the Buddha himself as we're lead to believe, I'll start with this question:

First, I'm assuming those Arhats in attendance during the Buddha's supposedly historical Mahayana teachings conceived the mind for enlightenment. Might not they have nonetheless recognized that some future beings would also have an affinity for the Bodhisattva vehicle, while others would only be attracted to the individual liberation vehicle? If that were the case, wouldn't they have been selective in who they passed either vehicle on to once they began to teach after the Buddha's death? Then, accordingly, wouldn't two different narratives and Dharmas have developed over the hundreds of subsequent years before it was decided to commit the Buddha's teachings to writing? And by that time, wouldn't one lineage have maintained their Mahayana focus while appreciating the upaya of having two different paths for beings of two different affinities, while another lineage would have held only to the authenticity of the Shravaka approach, committing to writing only the teachings they viewed as authentic and pertinent to their goal?

Sure, and that is exactly the historical point. But since, just as you said, Mahayana followers in the past (and present) think that the sutras were spoken directly by the Buddha, thus I was wondering whether there is an explanation from their side on the lack of other buddhas in the agamas. Although it is possible there isn't such an answer.

Anders Honore said:
Isn't it obvious? Th Mahayana sutras reveal things that weren't spoken in the agamas, either because it wasn't needed for the time or because it is not suitable for the Hinayana. Standard explanation for any addition the Mahayana sutras make to early Buddhism really.

This is a new translation, from Snow Lion, of Nagarjuna's Root of the Middle Way with an extensive (over 500pp) commentary by Mabja Jangchub Tsondru (d. 1185).  The main translator is Thomas Doctor, part of the Dharmachakra Translation Committee. The root text stands alone, and later each verse or line is commented on.

I am only 100pp or so into it, so these first impressions may change.  It is an excellent, very clear and helpful commentary.  Mabja's detailed outline is included, but not displayed in the usual indented lines, with italics and oodles of 2.2.A.b.x stuff.  The outline has little boxes with text connected by lines; sounds primitive, but much easier to use.

The only small quibbles I have are the translation of almost every term.  This would be fine if there were a glossary or the index had the Sanskrit equivalent next to the translated word - but neither is in this book.  When mentioning some old Indian schools - Enumerators is probably the Sankhya school and the Ritualists is Mimamsa, but "Far Throwers" ???

Another question that is not answered in the book is more biographical info on Mabja bodhisattva.  Maybe there is little or none, but considering his detailed, precise, scholarly and wise comments (plus relying on Chandrakirti) leads me to guess Sakya roots for him.

This is a new translation, from Snow Lion, of Nagarjuna's Root of the Middle Way with an extensive (over 500pp) commentary by Mabja Jangchub Tsondru (d. 1185).  The main translator is Thomas Doctor, part of the Dharmachakra Translation Committee. The root text stands alone, and later each verse or line is commented on.

I am only 100pp or so into it, so these first impressions may change.  It is an excellent, very clear and helpful commentary.  Mabja's detailed outline is included, but not displayed in the usual indented lines, with italics and oodles of 2.2.A.b.x stuff.  The outline has little boxes with text connected by lines; sounds primitive, but much easier to use.

The only small quibbles I have are the translation of almost every term.  This would be fine if there were a glossary or the index had the Sanskrit equivalent next to the translated word - but neither is in this book.  When mentioning some old Indian schools - Enumerators is probably the Sankhya school and the Ritualists is Mimamsa, but "Far Throwers" ???

Another question that is not answered in the book is more biographical info on Mabja bodhisattva.  Maybe there is little or none, but considering his detailed, precise, scholarly and wise comments (plus relying on Chandrakirti) leads me to guess Sakya roots for him.

Anyone else started reading it?

Malcolm wrote:
Not really a Sakya pa. He was scholar at Sangphu, a contemporary of Sonam Tsemo, probably knew him well. Died 1185.

"Far throwers" means Carvaka/lokayati, i.e. materialists who deny rebirth and ripening of karma.

We know virtually nothing about him apart from the fact that he was in the immediate circles of Patsab, the main translator of Candrakiriti's material into Tibetan.

Couldn't the passage of the Lotus Sutra about the lifespan of Shakyamuni be also valid for the view, that many Buddhas exist in the universe (and therefore the guidance by a Buddha is always available)?
"Good men, the Thus Come One observes how among living beings there are those who delight in a little Law, meager in virtue and heavy with defilement. For such persons I describe how in my youth I left my household and attained anuttara-samyak-sambodhi. But in truth the time since I attained Buddhahood is extremely long, as I have told you. It is simply that I use this expedient means to teach and convert living beings and cause them to enter the Buddha way. That is why I speak in this manner. (...) Why do I do this? Because if the Buddha remains in the world for a long time, those persons with shallow virtue will fail to plant good roots but, living in poverty and lowliness, will become attached to the five desires and be caught in the net of deluded thoughts and imaginings. If they see that the Thus Come One is constantly in the world and never enters extinction, they will grow arrogant and selfish, or become discouraged and neglectful. They will fail to realize how difficult it is to encounter the Buddha and will not approach him with a respectful and reverent mind."

I'm not looking for text critical conclusions, for that there are some fine scholarly works like "The concept of the Buddha: its evolution from early Buddhism to the trikāya theory" by Guang Xing. Also it's possible to go for a conspiracy theory that the sravakas deleted all the other buddhas but that's just non-sense to me. That's why I'm looking for another perspective on this. Of course, there's always the option to say that buddhas are upaya and such, but that doesn't answer a few things.

Yes, there were some Hinayana schools, the Mahasamghikas for instance, who had some concept of other buddhas. So maybe this problem never occurred in India or anywhere else. Still, in the agamas/nikayas there is no sign of other buddhas and those are the texts said to be preached for the sravakas. Consequently, since in the Mahayana sutras sravakas are also present, they should have known about other buddhas.

It doesn't seem valid to say that teaching about other buddhas is only a bodhisattva matter since in Mahayana texts it is all fine for sravakas to learn about them and even to aspire for other buddha-realms. So why are there no other buddhas mentioned in the Hinayana teachings, only some buddhas of the past and the next future buddha? Again, it is not the modern historical explanation what I'm looking for here but the addressing of it from a traditional Mahayana perspective.

There is an argument in the Katavattu where some other nikaya Buddhists assert Buddhas in other world systems. This rejected, saying that if there were such Buddhas, one should know their names and so on.

Malcolm wrote:
Hi Magnus:

The system of the nine yānas is actually an Anuyoga perspective, where Dzogchen is conceived of as the result of Anuyoga practice.

However, since the dgongs pa zang thal cycle, the Vima snying thig cycles, etc., frequently define the most secret unsurpassed great perfection cycle as not part of the nine yānas I am pretty comfortable in asserting there is a dzogchen that lies outside the nine yānas. This is the source of Chogyal Namkhai Norbu's assertion that there are two approaches to Dzogchen, one gradual, based on the nine yānas; and one which does not depend on the nine yānas at all, Dzogchen as a completely self-contained system of realization that does not depend at all on the vehicles of cause and result.

The Lamp The Severs Proliferation from the Copper Lettered Collection in the Vima snying thig has the following passage which will put things in context:

"The conceited vehicles of the nine yānas
do not depart even a an iota from eternalism and annihilationism."

The two can be taught separately, interwoven, or side by side.

Saying that the utterly secret unsurpassed cycle of Dzogchen is outside the nine yānas is the teaching of Nirmanakāya Garab Dorje. Therefore, since it is the teaching of Nirmanakāya Garab Dorje, it is not outside the pale of Buddhism.

Common Atiyoga is the basically sems sde, in this scheme of things.

The point is whether the cognition is deluded or undeluded in a definitive sense. The object of an undeluded cognition is an ultimate truth. The emphasis lays on the cognition apprehending the object, not the object. But since there cannot be a cognition at all sans an object, it is important to include an object in the formulation of how a truth is defined.

I select Chandrakirti for convenience since he is generally regarded as the authoritative commentarial voice concerning Nagarjuna's corpus of Madhyamaka works.

Conventionally, things have nature.  So if emptiness is the nature of things, it must be in the conventional sense.

So yes, there are terma systems where the lineage of Dzogchen teachings is as you describe, even so, believe it or not, Padmasambhava declares to Yeshe Tsogyal that Vimalamitra, and not he, is the main regent of Dzogchen teachings in Tibet. The resason Padmasambhaba teaches her Dzogchen is that she did not have the karmic connection with Vimalamitra to learn Dzogchen from him, or so it is stated in the dgongs pa zang thal.

And lots of other lineages too numerous to mention both long and short, kama and terma.

In any case, Dzogchen is not subject to the criteria of sutra. Things such as Supreme Nirmanakāyas and all this stuff is just a conceptual limitation created by trying fit Dzogchen within the narrow hermeneutics of Mahāyāna sūtra dogmatism. That is like trying to fit Mahāyāna sutra criteria into Hīnayāna sūtra dogmatism.

Just as Mahāyāna shares some features with Hīnayāna, Dogchen shares some features with Mahāyāna, but just as Mahāyāna cannot fit inside of the narrow criteria imposed by the Hīnayāna conception of the personage of buddhas; likewise, Dzogchen cannot fit inside the broader, yet still limiting conception of the personage of buddhas imposed by common mahāyāna. In other words, if you try to impose a common Mahāyāna hermeneutical framework on Dzogchen, it does not work. It is best to abandon that framework since it is not important in Dzogchen and does not work at all. So while Shakyamuni is considered one of the twelve historical teachers of Dzogchen prior to Garab Dorje for reason we have already discussed (he predicted the arrival of the effortless vehicle in the future), our teachings of Dzogchen do not come from Shakyamuni and there is no evidence that he ever taught it on Jambudvipa.

Nirmanakāyas do not have the certainty of place, time, teacher, teaching and retinue. Just accept that and move on.

Garab Dorje is not a tulku in the Tibetan cultural sense of the term. He is a tulku in the Padmasambhava and Shakyamuni sense of the term i.e. a nirmanakāya of compassion.

Mariusz said:
As I know Garab Dorje realized the Body of Light (Wyl. A'od-Phung) and  Padmasambhava the Great Transference Body (Wyl. Pho-Ba Ch'en-Po).

So are Garab Dorje and Padmasambhava  the same  Supreme Nirmanakayas as Buddha Shakyamuni and Buddha Maitreya who have limitless qualities (as 64 main features of Buddhahood, 18 distinctive qualities of Buddhahood, 32 physical marks of the Perfect One, 64 verbal marks of the Perfect One, 9 qualities and skills of Perfect One's enlightening influence and so on)?

Malcolm wrote:
Garab Dorje was an emanation of Vajrasattva/Vajradhara. He was not an ordinary human being, according to the Dzogchen tradition. He possessed all of the infinite qualities of a nirmanakāya. Padmasambhava was predicted by Shakyamuni in the sutras to be greater than himself, according to many biographies of Padmasambhava.

Anyway, this sort of limitation is unnecessary. Both Shakyamuni Buddha and Garab Dorje are emanations of Vajradhara -- their historical manifestation and set of teachings is different, but their continuums ultimately the same. Even so, in terms of historical manifestation, Garab Dorje is more important for Dzogchen practitioners. Thus we have many dzogchen guru yogas of Garab Dorje, no dzogchen guru yogas of Shakyamuni at all. Not even one. Why? Because the historical manifestation, Shakyamuni, is not in the lineage of Dzogchen. This is not a criticism of Shakyamuni, not at all. It is just a recognition of how the teachings come to us.

Thanks Nangwa, dzoki and Namdrol.

Perhaps I should have been more specific when I said "detailed".  I'm not looking for diagrams of all 72,000 channels.  I'm more concerned with the 3 major ones.  Specifically how they link to the crown of the head, between the eyes and below the naval.  Also I think I've been misunderstanding how (and if) they connect to the urethra and anus.  This misunderstanding is a bit disturbing to me as I'm concerned about the status of my practice now.  That's why a side view is important for me since the front view diagrams I have aren't that clear.  This is in reference to Sarma tradition too.  PM's would be much appreciated.

In order to establish that "dzogchen" is "without buddhism"; one would have to identify something in Buddhism that Dzogchen is missing; or conversely, something in Dzogchen that Buddhism is missing.

In reality, Dzogchen is just another way of explaining śūnyatāprābhāsvarāsaṁbhedaḥ in relation to the trikāya. No matter how profound Dzogchen may be (and it is the most profound teaching of Buddhism), it does not go beyond explaining how to realize the trikāya state through knowledge (vidyā,) of one's own basis (sthāna):
emptiness (śūnyatā, stong pa nyid; svarūpa, ngo bo; visuddha, ka dag; dharmakāya)
luminosity ('od gsal, prābhāsvarā; prakriti,rang bzhin) nirabhogana, lhun grub; sambhogakāya)
inseparability (āsaṁbhedaḥ, dbyer med; karuna, thugs rje; nirmanakāya)

Since śūnyatāprābhāsvarāsaṁbhedaḥ is nothing more than what the Buddha taught, even Dzogchen cannot go beyond being a teaching of a Buddha.

And as for "Essence Mahamudra," there is, in fact, a "Practice"--if you want to call it that.  It is the path on which one receives a special kind of empowerment, that's the "method."

Most, if not all, Kagyupas engage in some form of deity yoga, and even pranayama, as well as vipassana and samatha, and we apply these methods in combination with the "View" of Mahamudra.  I have never met a Kagyu Lama who does not embrace Vajrayana methods.  Then again, I haven't met every Kagyu Lama.

This knowledge has existed much before what you call "the advent of tantra", it has existed from the beginning, This is the inner experience area, it is also the area of tantra. It seems that there developed some schools that consciously deny the inner experience aspect of Dharma, in name only they accept that there is "enlightenment", their "enlightenment" is without knowledge and without experience, only then is it "true" enlightenment.
In the history of Dharma there is inner experience from the very beginning, therefore there is also tantra, or the likeness of tantra, from the very beginning. But then there are people with authority and power who want to decide what "true " enlightenment is, and hence they start their own schools whose main purpose is to wipe out some irritating persons and their influence who actually attained dhyana, samadhi and samapatti.
I think that for example Buddhaghosha had a wealth of inner the Dharma,  I would even say that innerly he was a tantric, this is because of the necessary dynamics of the dhyana process.

Is this so difficult to understand?


Malcolm wrote:
I understand your point of view, though I do not agree with it. I don't agree with your conspiracy theory either.

You seem think that Vajrayāna is all about dhyāna, samapatti and samadhi. It isn't.

Vajrayāna practice is a method of reversing dependent origination. Of course, in that process we need to use samadhi and samapatti. But not in the way it is used in sutrayāna methodology.

There is a school in Tibetan Buddhism called the Kagyu school. They teach a system called mahāmudra. They assert that mahāmudra is also found in the Mahāyāna sūtras (but not, of course in Hīnayāna sūtras. And they teach, in their mahāmudra, a system called sūtra mahāmudra which is the basis of the famed four yogas of mahāmudra of Gampopa.  They emphasize the practice of dhyana in their system of mahāmudra

They also clearly recognize a mahāmudra that comes from Vajrayāna practice. They further recognize a type of mahāmudra that comes from sudden insight based on a kind of introduction by a master, called essence mahāmudra.

They clearly differentiate sūtra mahāmudra and "tantric" mahāmudra by the methods that are used. The methods used in tantric mahāmudra are things like creation stage (visualizing oneself as a deity), mantra recitation, working with prāṇayāma (not mindfulness of breathing), "erotic" yogas, yogas connected with sleep, waking, etc.

The methods used in sutra mahāmudra are solely śamatha and vipaśyāna combined with the four yogas -- which are really stages in the deepening of śamatha and vipaśyāna.

Essence mahāmudra has no methods.

Vajrayāna is different than sūtra teachings because the methods of deity yoga, prāṇayāma, etc., are never taught in sūtra. No cakras, no ṇāḍīs, etc. None of that newage hippy Vajrayāna stuff is found in the sūtras, nor explained by sūtra masters -- not in India, not in China, not in Japan.

We Vajrayānists assert that all of our hippy methods, deity yoga, and so on, cause our path to be faster than the pure Mahāyāna sūtra route. These criteria did not evolve in Tibet, they evolved in India. Of course, there is some internal debate as I mentioned above. The Kagyu school in many respects is close to Chan school and even uses some Chan scriptures as a basis for their arguments.

You can accept or reject Vajrayāna claims -- but at least you should clearly understand what they are -- a clarity that thus far has been absent in your presentation.

Could be but irrelevant Can Shakyamuni as the Supreme Nirmanakya be compared with Garab Dorje as only a tulku (trans. Nirmanakaya)? I guess Garab Dorje is only a tulku, somehow "the predicted teacher" particulary "emanated" to teach Dzogchen, because the next supreme Nirmanakaya will be Maitreya Buddha only. The Supreme Nirmanakaya is limitless, not only particular for any class of teaching.


Malcolm wrote:
Maitreya won't even teach Vajrayāna, let along Dzogchen.

Garab Dorje is not a tulku in the Tibetan cultural sense of the term. He is a tulku in the Padmasambhava and Shakyamuni sense of the term i.e. a nirmanakāya of compassion.

Namdrol,
In one of your posts you mentioned that people here could be guilty of tawa chogs dzin.. Holding views as supreme or something like that.. I believe that tawa chog dzin refers to holding asceticism and ritual/discipline to be supreme methods of liberation .  Certainly the Buddha held views that were correct to be superior to views which were incorrect.



Malcolm wrote:
There are two terms -- one is ལྟ་བ་ཕྱོགས་འཛིན -- holding a biased view. What you are taking about is ལྟ་བ་མཆོག་ཏུ་འཛིན་པ, dṛṣṭiparāmarśaḥ -- this is simply holding something inferior or hīna as good or high. They sound very similar in Tibetan, and it is possible that in common language they have become somewhat interchangeable.

What you mention above is in fact śīlavrataparāmarśaḥ as well as mithyādṛṣṭi i.e. false views. While we are at it, the other two, just to round things out are satkāyadṛṣṭi and antagrāhadṛṣṭi respectively, holding a view of personal identity and holding a view of extremes (either existence or non-existence).

I was just saying that people are often chauvinistic about this issue of eating meat, almost becoming like Devadatta.

I believe the use of the word Buddhism is quite complicated and polemic as it is a western neologism. What Buddhism are we talking about? Dzogchen differs a lot from some schools.
The path taught by the Buddha leads one beyond concepts too. We can't assume Sadharma is Buddhadharma. It's its fruit. Sadharma is beyond "Buddhism" too, and it's the fruit of practicing Buddhadharma.
Don't assume I don't like Jim Valby. I don't know him, but knowing he is a cherished disciple of my lama, I naturally feel respect for his methods, although in this particular case it is not the sort of presentation that rings my bell (the title, note, because the rest I don't know).

Hello Teachers/Friends,

I've been wondering about the real meaning of the "good"/"wholesome" which we should cultivate according to the teaching of the Buddhas:

The Teaching of The Buddhas

Not to do evil,
To cultivate good [the Chinese translation: to do all the good],
To purify one’s mind –
This is the Teaching of the Buddhas
-- Dhammapada 183

After studying the Buddha's teaching, especially the Noble eight-fold path, I came to the understanding that the "good"/"wholesome" the Buddhas would like us to cultivate is non-evil/non-unwholesome (non-sensuality/non-greed, non-ill will/non-aversion, non-cruelty, non- wrong speech/action/livelihood...) instead of doing all the good like a world saver. If my understanding is correct, then I worry about the Chinese translation/interpretation/practice of "To do all the good" instead of "To cultivate non-evil/non-unwholesome".

I'd like to know your opinion about it. Metta to all,

Malcolm wrote:
It is easy to say something does not accord with logic or reality and refuse to explain anything. Point one simply is a claim. Ok, you have made an unsubstantiated claim.

Vasubandhu clearly states that whatever accords with dependent origination, etc., can be accepted as "buddhavacana" even if not spoken by Shakyamuni.

However, some narrow-minded people make assertions such as "Dzogchen is not buddhist because it was not taught by Shakyamuni Buddha." Other narrow minded people say "Anuttarayoga tantra is not buddhist because it was not taught by the Buddha", etc. .Still other narrow minded people say "Mahāyāna was not taught by by the Buddha", etc.

Yet in each case, Mahāyāna, Vajrayāna and Dzogchen are successively held by their adherent not only to hold the central message of Buddhism, but illustrate the most essential and salient part of Buddhist teachings not expressed in "lower" yānas. Of course, these adherents can also be accused of narrow mindedness too (even if they are correct).

So, yes, there are narrow minded people who reject teachings based on biased criteria. And for that they are at fault.

As Shantideva points out, the ultimate of the lower system is the conventional of the higher system.

The spirit of Buddhism is not about fault-finding. Buddhism, as a spiritual & religious vehicle for the diversity of humanity, has certainly evolved since Shakyamuni Buddha, to accommodate the needs of the human & cultural diversity. Most good Buddhists accept this. Most good & well-meaning Buddhists do not find fault with this.

But, to assert:...the point of view of narrow minded people is that if something is not taught by Shakyamuni Buddha, it is not the teaching of the Buddha...
falls down in two ways:

Nyoshul Khen's approach is a bandaid applied to Nyingma Hermeneutics to avoid Gelug refutation. He is basically claiming -- since the dharmakāya of all buddhas is the same, any teaching of Samantabhadra is a teaching of Shakyamuni Buddha.  The converse would also have to be true, since Garab Dorje is a nirmanakāya, Shakyamuni's teaching of Vinaya is also Garab Dorje's teaching.  Thus, this idea is only formally true -- it is not historically true.

For example, both Shakyamuni and Garab Dorje are nirmanakāyas of Vajradhara. Vajradhara is an emanation of Samantabhadra. But Shakyamuni and Garab Dorje are not the same person. They lived in different bodies, at different times, and taught different teachings.

According to Nyoshul Khenpo,
"Samantabhadra and SHakyamuni are both aspects of a single state of Buddhahood.   This buddhahood in the context of dharmakaya is Samantabhadra; in the context of the sambhogakaya, it is Vajradhara; and in the context of nirmanakaya, it is Shakyamuni.  And so we need to understand the three kayas as inseparable.  Otherwise we could reach some kind of erroneous conclusion, such as, "Dzogchen is not the teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni."  Misconceptions such as this develop out of ignorance of this inseparability of the three kayas"

Malcolm wrote:
Nevertheless, not all Nirmanakāyas give the same teachings. For example, Anuttrarayoga tantra will not be taught during the dispensation of Maitreya, so they say. Vipasi, Sikhin, Krakucchamunda are not mentioned in the lineage of teachers of Dzogchen -- and yet they too have all three kāyas. And yet Kashyapa and Shakyamuni Buddha are.

To say that Shakyamuni did not teach Dzoghen means that the words never left his lips while there was a Shakyamuni Buddha living in Jambudvipa.

Kashyapa actually taught Dzogchen, Shakyamuni predicted Dzogchen. None of the other past buddhas are mentioned at all in that lineage.

So I don't accept the fault you are implying (i.e. that I am suffering from a misconception about the inseparability of the three kāyas). On the contrary, you are not making a proper distinction between the five certainties possessed by Sambhogakāyas and the lack of those five certainties for Nirmanakāyas (time, place, teacher, retinue, and teaching).

Incidentally, it is also the position of Chogyal Namkhai Norbu that Shakyamuni never taught Dzozgchen. His role in being mentioned as one of the twelve teachers of Dzogchen is a result of his having predicted the effortless vehicle. But he did not teach it, according to ChNN. I concur since in general the nirmanakāya for Dzogchen is Garab Dorje, and not Shakyamuni.

I was responding, in the main, to your notion of "as defined by Mahayana doctrine".  There are ages when there is no such doctrine, nor Theravada, nor any school of Buddhism.  So Namdrol's point about compassion is important. There must be some powerful wish within a person that leads to actions, when there is no teachings of a Buddha around, that lead that one to strive to help others beyond one lifetime.  Whether that inner drive is based on some old vasanas from previous contact with a Buddha or his teachings, I do not know.  Vasubandhu & Nagarjuna (and others) have laid out the root causes & conditions for one's original bodhicitta vow or aspiration, but no time right now to look them up.  Memory says that compassion for others is the best motive, but other motives can result in bodhisattva-hood.

I know this is impossible to quantify but in general could you feel comfortable saying something like the average Northern European needs to eat a small steak every month for optimal health?  Could you posit a very general rule of thumb on this matter?

My former Taoist teacher (a Westerner) was told by his teacher (a well known Taoist Chinese martial artist) to eat some meat every once in a while for years.  He didn't follow this advice (very uncharacteristic for him as he usually followed everything his teacher told him) until one day at a party he sort of accidentally ate some lamb (actually his teacher basically fixed this situation)  and the effect on him was so galvanizing that he felt like he was superman.  So he now follows his teacher's advice even on his diet.

This story did arise in the context of karmic consequences of meat eating many years ago (I haven't studied with my former Taoist teacher for at least 15 years now) but the Taoist view on this is different from the Chinese Mahayana view to begin with.

Well, according to Sonam Tsemo, what actually happened was this: when the Buddha was a hell being he aroused great compassion for other hell beings, and asked the yamas whether he could take on the sufferings of other hell beings. In doing, after his head caught fire and he died, he was born first as a deva of Trāyāstriṁśā heaven, then as the son of the a potter in Jambudvipa. At that time, he met the ancient Buddha Shakyamuni and, offering that Buddha some porridge, generated bodhicitta.

So while one may technically claim that one must by necessity generate bodhicitta in the presence of a buddha in the past, the necessary precondition for bodhicitta is compassion, and it is for that reason that Candrakirit cites compassion as the cause of all bodhisattvas.

Whether the above events are true or are a parable is irrelevant -- the point is that compassion is the cause of bodhicitta and so therefore it is possible to say that one can become a bodhisattva without having ever met a Buddha. I would rate compassion as more important than a vow.

HHDL does not eat meat when in Dharamsala. He only eats meat when he travels. His kitchen is vegetarian.

Malcolm wrote:
I didn't say they were violent because they ate meat. What I said was that meat eating, in excess, makes people more aggressive. This is actually taught in the sutras that people bring to bear to criticize the habit of eating meat. If you read back in the thread, you will read some of those statements.

The sutras however do not really give a precise reason why this is so. The reason is that anger cuts the root of compassion. The meat the people tend to like are warming meats like lamb, buffalo, or aged meats and so on. All of these things reinforce pitta dosha, which increases the klesha of devsha i.e. hatred/anger. When the klesha of anger increases, it is more difficult to give rise to compassion.

You brought in the example of Tibetans.

I merely pointed out to you that Tibet has a fairly violent culture -- there is no doubt in my mind that their excess fondness for lamb and yak contributes overall to the cultural violence which is fairly common in Tibet. But it is not the sole reason, the only reason, or even the main reason. It is one contributing factor. Meat eating is also a contributing factor in the aggressive nature of Western Culture especially Northern European culture.

We are what we eat, to invoke a cliche.

To give an example, pork greatly increases kapha (bad kan), therefore, it reinforces ignorance. It is commonly held that chicken and eggs increase desire; snake meat increases anger, and pork ignorance ala the diagrams of the six realms.

But in a general way, the three doshas increase the three kleshas, and the three kleshas support the three doshas.

Adamantine said:
Why would you ever want to eat any of these things, considering we are trying to go beyond these negative emotions? In tantric practices where
you are transforming anger or desire would you want to increase the intensity of these emotions for fuel? I understand many yogis would only eat lamb meat, as it is one of the few meats that doesn't add to obscuration. . .

You say 'it is commonly held that'; but do you believe that eggs really increase desire?

Malcolm wrote:
When three doshas are in balance, they are also called dhatus in this sense, constituents. The health of our body is based on having a proper balance of the three dhatus -- when vata, pitta and kapha are balanced, we are healthy. So for example, if someone has a severe vata imbalance affecting the heart, one of the main remedies for this condition is a eaglewood formula that contains yak heart. It works beautifully. I have used this for patients experiencing severe heart issues connected with edema.

As far as lamb goes -- lamb or any food overused will lead to increased afflictions. In the case of lamb, it is very warming which is why Tibetans like it so much. Same with Yak.

Eggs are pure reproductive tissue. So, I think there is something present as a "prabhava" in eggs that does indeed increase desire when overused.

The main point I am making is that there is relationship between any food we eat and the three doshas and three afflictions. To much red meat increases pitta dosha and vitiates blood -- leading to high blood pressure, heart attacks and so on. It also makes people very aggressive. We can easily see that cultures where people eat a lot of red meat, cow, yak, etc., that people are more aggressive, etc.

Malcolm wrote:
I used to plagued by this issue as well. But then I realized -- we have the capacity (mostly undeveloped) to know the minds of others and communicate through the mind.

Consciousness is a field. It is one of the six aggregate fields that make up the universe i.e.the sadadhātu:

the field of earth
the field of water
the field of fire
the field of air
the field of space
the field of consciousness

Consciousness is limited only by the delusion of matter. In reality, one's mind has the capacity to be anywhere in the universe. Therefore, it does not matter where any sentient being may be located after that being leaves the body of this lifetime.

By thinking of that being and making a connection through certain mantras that directly spring from dharmatā, we create a positive cause for that sentient being to attain full awakening. This kind of method is a special feature of the teachings of the great perfection. You will not find this kind of teaching in other yanas. If our knowledge and wisdom are sufficiently developed, even mantras are unnecessary.

As a result, there are two benefits -- one, the mind of that being of the animal realms is benefitted. Second, their karmic body does not go completely to waste merely to feed others who are not on a path and have no concept of a path.

Everything in Dharma practice works because of the mind. When for example we do the Jvalamukha water torma -- in reality pretas cannot drink water. But through our intention we bring them to mind and briefly influence their minds so that they see a stream of nectar with everything they could ever want contained in the water we pour from our hands.

Different meats affect different doshas, as do different diets in general.

Likewise, a diet that is too spicy, too much red meat, alcohol, etc, increases pita dosha (mkhris pa) and this reinforces hatred and anger.

In particular, if we are tantric or dzogchen practitioners, it is very important to understand our diet in terms of the three doshas and the remedies prescribed for them in various tantras and upadeshas.

Of course, if we are common Mahayana practitioners without any methods of transformation, etc., then it is better we do not eat meat at all save conditions of illness.

I have once read that the actual reason for abstaining from meat is that its consumption leads to an increase of desire and anger. For those practitioners who skillfully apply the suitable methods from the path of transformation or the path of self-liberation, such increase of defilements should not be a problem.

What HHDL means is that among religions there is no shared authority, no central committee deciding for everyone what is true and what is false. Recognizing the subjective nature of religious opinion, HHDL offers a more secular view. This is correct. To protect everyone's liberty, it is necessary to subordinate religious views to secular law i.e. insist on separation of church and state.

Since there can be no agreement among various religions around which is the "true" religion -- tolerance is required. This however does not mean that if you are a Buddhist you are required to think that Christianity makes truths claims that are as valid as Buddhist truth claims. All that needs to be recognized is that all religions make truth claims that cannot be verified by any mutually agreed upon standard.

So, I know for a fact that HHDL feels that Buddhism is the best religion. He also recognizes that this is just an opinion and insisting on this opinion to someone who does not share the same idea leads to strife and war. So rather than insisting that Buddhism is the best religion for everyone, he merely asserts it is the best religion for himself.

Then, when we cross that divide, we try to look at people from the point of view of their goodness. We try to meet people at that point.

Since we cannot make all religions the same, we need to recognize where it is that people are the same. Where they are the same is that they want happiness and freedom from suffering -- and religions evolve to provide those answers, differently for different people.

You have posted a vast array of valid and pertinent points, before continuing I will draw your attention to the fact that I consider eating meat in order to overcome sickness/illness can be valid, but I want to ask a question (that of course you do not need to answer):

To me the points you are presenting here veer widely from the position you used to post on e-sangha where you quoted from practitioners like Shakbar, who out of his boundless compassion for all sentient beings reached the verge of death from starvation (a number of times) on the plateus of Tibet, rather than consume the flesh of sentient beings; to your current more "practical" position, based on research from the Medicine Buddha Sutra (and other teachings obviously), where you believe that the flesh of sentient beings may be consumed for medical purposes.

I am not going to go into the karma vipakka of consuming flesh as I believe that the teachings of the Buddha (both in the Suuta and Sutra Pitaka) are quite clear.

My question is how much of this change in view rests on a wish to increase your capacity for boundless compassionate action and how much on a more (again logical) self-centred attempt to preserve this impemanent illusory body?

Malcolm wrote:
Hi Greg:


As for Shabkar, he was not an ordinary person -- I doubt he was at risk from starving at any time. Same goes for Nyala Pema Duddul.

You will recall I maintained quite consistently on e-sangha that meat as medicine was perfectly allowable.

So I have not really changed my view that much. I still think that meat industry is an environmental disaster from every point of view. I still think that eating meat is over all a negative habit. Etc.

What I was negating here was that meat-eating necessarily has a karma vipaka of killing.

There is no fallacy - you are creating a premise in assuming that the plants are grown with harmful chemicals etc. whereas it is a certainty that all meat requires death, and almost always in the human context, deliberate killing for that purpose.

Malcolm wrote:
It is always certain that modern agriculture requires harming millions upon millions of creatures, both deliberately in the case of pesticides, and unintentionally.


Yeshe said:
Earlier in the thread you claimed intention (re. karma) was a key. So how do you now arrive at the conclusion that the intention to feed yourself is unconnected to the intention to eat a being reared and killed to satisfy your demands, and that this is not worse than a vegetarian diet.

Malcolm wrote:
No being has ever been reared and killed to satisfy my demands. Ever.


Yeshe said:
You also want to tie the plant based diet to your assumptions about it, deliberately killling with pesticides etc, as this suits your argument.  I know no vegetarians who wish for beings to die in orde to feed them.

Malcolm wrote:
And yet, they regularly support an agriculture system where millions of beings are killed deliberately in order to meet their demands for food. Blindness at best.


Yeshe said:
I know no meat-eaters who can think otherwise - they desire a killing as it is the only way to create the food they crave.

Malcolm wrote:
False connection -- I don't desire any animals to be killed at all. At all. Yet they are, all the time. Whether I eat a little meat or not is irrelevant. Your imputation of intention is based on a false premise i.e. "If you eat meat, you necessarily desire that an animal has been killed for you.".

Yeshe said:
I feel you are also incorrect in that the meat is free of any connection to the consciousness of the being it once was.

Malcolm wrote:
Once there is no vāyu in that body, there is no consciousness. Consciousness is inextricably bound to vāyu (rlung). Once an animal has been butchered, etc., that sentient being's consciousness is not longer connected with that body in anyway.

Yeshe said:
You cannot be sure at what point the bardo being is truly separated from its former life - up to 49 days I believe, during which that bardo being can be very much attached to its former 'form' and need help through Phowa to move on.

Malcolm wrote:
Sure you can. You can be absolutely certain. If an animal or a human dies on its own, within three days or less it's inner breath will have ceased. At that point, its consciousness will have left its body; in the case of a butchered animal, as soon as it is eviscerated and its heart is removed. The only beings exempt from this in our dimension are yogis in thugdam.

Once you are in the bardo, you are no longer connected with your former body. Full stop. You have a new body, since you are now a ghandharva. The gandharva might linger in the place where it died, but not in the body it has separated from and left behind.

In any event, "49" days is a symbolic number. There is no guarantee that any ghandarva will remain in the bardo for 49 days.

Yeshe said:
No, on the contrary, I think that just because something can be used for medicine, even if effective, it does not mean that we should use it.  My guess is that the tigers massacred for Chinese medicine may agree.

The same argument obtains with our sources of food.

Malcolm wrote:
That is not medicine. That is superstition (tigers, etc, poached for male potency formulas in China).

Agreed, people should start growing more of their own food to limit the harm caused by industrial agriculture, both organic and non-organic, to "pests" and to the environment as a whole.

However, in my pervious post I was addressing the fallacies inherent in asserting that a modern vegetarian diet is inherently "more compassionate" than a diet in which some meat is consumed. There are people who think that we should just wear only plastic (whoops,BP), or soy based "plastics (Whoops, Monsanto), etc.

Of course, if we abandoned milk and dairy there are also consequences. Animals that humans don't eat wind up on extinction lists sooner or later.

Personally, I think we need deep ecological solutions to these issues, managed non-catastrophic scaling back of human populations to a hundred million would make this world a much nicer place. If we don't manage it, catastrophe will, sooner or later.

You are surely not suggesting that he should ingore it.  If that was the approach, they would make scant progress.

Equally, if a 'scientist' discovers a plant-based cure for a headache (aspirin) the Ayurvedic practitioner should close their minds?

By all means have faith in Rishis but don't deny them the opportunity to continue their learning. When, exactly should they decide that they know everything and close their minds to new cures?

In terms of what humans are intended to eat or use as medication, I would hope that the over-arching consideration in all such choices would be Compassion.  Should an Indian or Tibetan medical practitioner really be so arrogant as to assume they know everything?  After all, what is a traditional healer in search of natural medicines other than a scientist?

There I was directly exposed to people, and to a movement, that attempted to bring together the wisdom of the world's spiritual traditions, as well as science... After more than three months in what was a most amazing country ... I was a changed man.  I could no longer live in the comfort of an exclusivist standpoint that takes Buddhsim to be the only true religion.

I guess it comes down to 'need'. The peoples you cite eat that meat because they is often little else available there. However, IMHO that is viable more because as omnivores we are wonderful at surviving on practically anything.

Your case is based on 'animal protein' as if it alone has the amino acids necessary for humans.

No, that is not it. Like anything in nature, there are synergistic properties in meat that cannot be reduced to mere "amino acids" etc. I am not making that argument. You are.

[/quote] Where are these people who must have meat instead of other food sources ?[/quote]

well, eskimos, mongolians, Tibetans, many Northern Europeans, etc. you might be surprised at the large numbers of people who have evolved with a high percentage of animal protein in their diet.

I am vegetarian and heal very quickly - a balanced human diet does not need meat for health.  I know hundreds of vegetarians who are also healthy, which in research terms is a good sized sample. Anecdotally, I know some very well, such as one at my gym who is a retired world class cyclist and still marathon runner and is strictly vegan. You've also had research quoted to you on this thread.

They add a little meat to their diet -- health problem solved. I have seen this many times, not only once. You can criticize and imagine that such people are not really eating properly, but you would be wrong.

Such people are generally of European descent, but not only.

If you reply, "Use organic crops", this does not help matters at all. Organic food production, especially at the scale we produce food in the US for the organic market requires the use of a whole range of organic pesticides and herbicides.

In order for these pests to die, isn't it so that someone must intend to kill them? And isn't it so that by ordering such vegetables and grain you are creating a demand for a food that involves abusing, torturing and killing animals such gophers, rats, birds, and insects? Since we are not raising pests for food, when we kill them, this is just a "by-product" of a vegetarian diet?

Every action has an effect, so what do you suppose the karmic effect of consuming the bodies of others unnecessarily is going to create?

Malcolm wrote:
I don't know about you, but when I eat meat, the sentient being associated with those remains has long since exited the bardo. When I eat meat, I am not torturing anyone. There is no magical trace on the corpse of that animal. There is no magic connection. When I eat meat, I understand that the animal of course did not want to die. I feel compassion for that animal.

Nevertheless, that animal would be dead no matter whether I eat its remains or not. This is a fact.

At least when I eat the remains of an animal, I have a direct representation of a suffering sentient being to work with -- and to the bargain, its death is not completely wasted. At least its remains, its physical elements, are reinforcing the life and practice of a Dharma practitioner.

When I eat meat, I have a mind, the animal has a mind -- and through my intention in considering that animal's plight in samsara, I make a connection with that animal through the mind. That connection is made stronger because now I have a direct representation of that animal. Thinking of that animal, I can recite a healing mantra. By thinking of that animal, I make a connection. And that animal, according to the teachings, will eventually be reborn as my student. By eating meat, I am using meat as a means for increasing compassion.

And since, at this point the animal's mind is no longer connected to that piece of meat in front of me, the sentient being that used to own that flesh is not harmed at all when I consume that left over meat from its corpse. Whatever harm it experienced had already happened. It is somewhere else in the three realms, it is not a ghost inhabiting the dead flesh in front of me. There is no shamanistic trace of the animal left on that dead corpse once the mind has parted the body. At that point, it is just an inanimate collection of four elements.

When I eat plant based food, it is the same. I know for a fact that many beings were harmed in the process of bring that food to my plate. So I also consider that when I am eating an apple, for example. Or an orange. Etc. So I bring awareness to that act of eating, recite a healing mantra, make a connection with all the beings harmed and destroyed by harvesting of that plant-based food.

Living in samsara necessarily involves harming other living beings. But harming other living beings does not necessarily involve negative karma. Buddha understood this distinction; Mahavira and Devadatta did not.

For example, many kinds of beings make homes in trees, in plants, and so on. When we destroy their homes and bodies to harvest plant food, or build a house, or mow our lawn, etc., we are contributing to their suffering -- but we don't care. Somehow, this escapes the attention of some strict Buddhist vegetarians. Somehow, they don't seem to care about the poisons used in agriculture that poison not only insects, but birds, small animals, and so on.

The illogic of your point of view is that when someone eats meat they are necessarily 1) responsible for the karmic acts of another (already rejected) 2) contributing to the suffering of the animal (already rejected). Neither of these arguments is valid.

It is certain that when you slaughter meat, or order it from a butcher directly, you are contributing to that suffering -- but that is all. It is also a certainty that when you harvest plants you will kill some creature. There is no doubt. And you will also be robbing many others of their homes. Not only that, you will be stealing the food of many other creatures. Oh, for sure you can claim -- "This is my food, I planted it, the birds, deer and insects are stealing it from me" -- but they do not see it that way.

So we can imagine a perfect samsara where no one is suffering -- but of course such a samsara is just a fantasy.

I don't believe that consuming the bodies of others is conducive to attaining enlightenment; the Lankavatara Sutra agrees, saying that the comsuming of meat harms the development of compassion.

Malcolm wrote:
Right and the Hevajra tantra says that those with compassion eat meat. So? You can follow provisional sutras like the Lanka-avatara, I will follow tantra. And yes, I am aware of what Kalacakra says on the subject. I have also read Shabkar.

Unknown said:
If you think about it, it makes perfect sense.  If we want even the tiniest thing from others, much less disregarding their pain so that we can consume their bodies, a supremely compassionate mind will not be forthcoming.

Malcolm wrote:
Who's disregarding pain and suffering? When I eat meat [the little meat that I do eat], it is a conscious choice, and serves as a cause for compassion, as I have explained.

In reality, my body is made of four elements, a plant is made of four elements, the bodies of sentient beings are made of four elements. There is no difference in this respect. We use different combinations of the four elements for different purposes, depending on our constitution and our health.

You may claim that no one needs to eat meat to maintain a healthy body -- but then you have to explain why Medicine Buddha explains the use of so many different kinds of meat in our diet as well as in medicine.

So as I have said, the main point is to be aware of what you are doing.

Fair question.

I have said repeatedly in this thread that eating meat is not good. That in general it is negative.

What I have rejected is that meat eating has a moral i.e. karmic consequence even though one is not involved in killing animals and do not ask people to do so on one's behalf.

I also made this clarification on e-sangha.

As for myself, due to a surgery I had slow healing injuries that required that I eat meat.

However, I maintain a vegetarian kitchen, and never cook meat at home.

I do eat meat in restaurants provided that the meat is not raised inhumanely.

So, while I do not claim to be a vegetarian -- my diet is 95 percent plant based. I eat perhaps at most a pound of flesh a month on average.

When I do eat meat, I employ a method to make a connection with the creature in question, so I do not remain indifferent or unaware.

Malcolm wrote:
"Eating meat" does not mean one is not concerned.

We do not eat the minds of sentient beings -- we eat their bodies which have been separated from their minds. What suffers is the mind, not the body. It is quite possible to eat meat and be a supremely compassionate person, for example, HH Dalai Lama, etc.

Somehow, we think it is ok to be indifferent if one animal kills and eats another for food -- but somehow it is worse when humans kill and eat animals. We don't spend much time worrying about spiders feeding on flies, etc. We think it is "natural", part of samsara, part of their suffering. Well, the suffering of animals is to eat one another. In this respect, human beings eat animals, and always have. Of course there are some exceptions, but virtually everywhere we go in the world, we find human beings are consuming animals. This is part of Samsara. Are we indifferent to suffering? No. Can we fix that suffering? No. No one can stop the suffering of another being. Itis impossible. Not even Buddha can stop the suffering of the six realms. If he could have, he would have.

So we are left with samsara. It is suffering. We are trying end that suffering. If one thinks that refraining from eating meat is stopping some animal's suffering in a real sense, one is deluded. By the time its remains come to your plate, it is already reborn, lunch for something else. This is not indifference, this is reality.

There is only one way to stop suffering. Meet Dharma, reflect on Dharma, realize Dharma. That's it.

So, whether we eat meat or not, we try to be compassionate and move on to more important issues.

Some Buddhists turn vegetarianism into kind of a political party, spending lots of time trying to condition others with their views: "We are the fantastic vegetarians, true followers of Buddha". All this amounts to is "lta ba phyogs 'dzin", grasping onto biased views.

You need to distinguish between "taking a life" which is an act that has a karmic result from "killing", which is not necessarily a karmic act in the Buddhist sense of term. If people going to slaughter animals whether I eat them or not (all evidence suggests they will), than there is very little reason to assume my eating meat is "creating" demand.

"Taking a life" i.e. killing in this sense is an intentional act. You have a being, you have motivation (you want to kill this being), you have the act itself, and then you are happy you did it. This is a perfect act of killing i.e. taking a life. This is explained very well by the Buddha.

Eating meat does not satisfy any of these criteria of necessity. Hence, you can eat meat without it necessarily being an act that produces some kind of huge negative karmic burden.

Aemilius,

Could you brush up your sources? I mean, when you refer to a text as a source you should have access to it and be able to give an exact citation. First you say Wayman said the Avatamsaka Sutra is among the tantras, now that Conze was unaware of the large number of meditation texts. Both are unlikely statements.

"As a more or less public system of thought, the Tantra gathered momentum after 500 or 600 A.D. Its beginnings do, however, go back to the dawn of human history, when an agricultural society was pervaded by magic and witchcraft, human sacrifice and the cult of the mother goddess, fertility rites and chtonic deities. The Tantra is not really a new creation, but  the result of an absorption of primitive beliefs by the literary tradition, and their blending with Buddhist philosophy."
(Edward Conze: Buddhism - Its Essence and Development, p. 176-177)

Later he lists three practices specific to Tantra:

1. the recitation of spells
2. the performance of ritual gestures and dances
3. the identification with deities by means of a special kind of meditation

There is no involvement with Shakyamuni in any Mahayoga Tantra in Nyingma. It is not necessary. Teaching of tantras is mainly a Sambhogakāya teaching. Nirmanakāyas do not possess the five certainties.

In my personal opinion, these "proofs" that Shakyamuni Buddha was directly related to disseminating Anuttarayoga tantra are baseless.

As I said, we have example where according to tradition, the Buddha manifested the mandalas of Kalacakra and Guhyasamaja. But manifesting a mandala and teaching are two different things altogether. Even here, while Indrabhuti spread the Guhyasamaja in his kingdom eventually the lineage died out. It was later revived by a Dakini who received it from Vajrapani, and bestowed both the Tattvasamgraha and the Guhyasamaja to King Visukalpa, who then spread it very widely in South India. In reality the author of the present recension of the Guhyasamaja Tantra is Indrabhuti. The author of the present recension of the Hevajra is Mahasiddha Virupa, etc.

Check out David Orton's Left Bio Centrism Primer:

Left Biocentrism Primer
March 15, 1998

The following Primer is a result of a protracted collective discussion among a numer of those who support left biocentrism and deep ecology.

- Left biocentrism is a left focus or theoretical tendency within the deep ecology movement, which is subversive of the existing industrial society. It accepts and promotes the eight-point Deep Ecology Platform drawn up by Arne Naess and George Sessions. Left biocentrism holds up as an ideal, identification, solidarity, and compassion with all life. "Left" as used in left biocentrism, means anti- industrial and anti-capitalist, but not necessarily socialist. The expressions 'left biocentrism' or 'left ecocentrism' are used interchangeably.

- Left biocentrism accepts the view that the Earth belongs to no one. While raising a number of criticisms, left biocentrism is meant to strengthen, not undermine, the deep ecology movement which identifies with all life.

- Left biocentrism says that individuals must take responsibility for their actions and be socially accountable. Part of being individually responsible is to practice voluntary simplicity, so as to minimize one's own impact upon the Earth.

- Left biocentrists are concerned with social justice and class issues, but within a context of ecology. To move to a deep ecology world, the human species must be mobilized, and a concern for social justice is a necessary part of this mobilization. Left biocentrism is for the redistribution of wealth, nationally and internationally.

- Left biocentrism opposes economic growth and consumerism. Human societies must live within ecological limits so that all other species may continue to flourish. We believe that bioregionalism, not globalism, is necessary for sustainability. The perspective of the late German Green philosopher Rudolf Bahro is accepted that, for world-wide sustainability, industrialized countries need to reduce their impact upon the Earth to about one tenth of what it is at the present time. It is also incumbent upon non- industrialized nations to become sustainable and it is necessary for industrialized nations to help on this path.

- Left biocentrism holds that individual and collective spiritual transformation is important to bring about major social change, and to break with industrial society. We need inward transformation, so that the interests of all species override the short-term self-interest of the individual, the family, the community, and the nation.

- Left biocentrism believes that deep ecology must be applied to actual environmental issues and struggles, no matter how socially sensitive, e.g. population reduction, aboriginal issues, workers' struggles, etc.

- Social ecology, eco-feminism and eco-marxism, while raising important questions, are all human-centered and consider human-to-human relations within society to be more important and, in the final analysis, determine society's relationship to the natural world. Left biocentrism believes that an egalitarian, non-sexist, non-discriminating society, a highly desirable goal, can still be exploitive towards the Earth.

- Left biocentrists are "movement greens" in basic orientation. They are critical of existing Green political parties, which have come to an accommodation with industrial society and have no accountability to the deep ecology movement.

- To be politically relevant, deep ecology needs to incorporate the perspective advanced by left biocentrism.

Did not think you are imposing, just adding that as it is important component to these discussions.

We Buddhists don't kill -- this is axiomatic. It is the first rule. Second, we try to limit harm (ahimsa).

There is never a time when meat, in the medicine tantras, is absolutely endorsed or prohibited. It is regarded as a normal part of human diet. Sometimes eaten, sometimes not.

It is clear to me that eating meat is not "good" for all the reasons many have given. In our culture, eating industrial meat is very bad, actually in terms of grain, water, fuel, cruelty, etc.

In more ancient cultures, people were closer to the source. If a monastery wanted meat, they had to order it directly from the nomads that butchered the meat and so on. So there is a little bit of difference. etc.


Namdrol said:
First of all, this objection has been addressed by Bhavaviveka.

You have to understand -- we are under no obligation to regard all sutras as definitive except those sutras defined according to the criteria of Akshayanirmatinirdesha sutra. So there is a limit to how much citations can serve you.

Adamantine said:
Not serving me, these are citations Chatral Rinpoche uses. Apparently he is not that concerned with the criteria of the Akshayanirmatinirdesha sutra? What are these criteria?
Medicine Buddha taught the four tantras of medicine, also he included meat as part of diet, not just medicines.
I am assuming, as with ayurveda, that prescriptions of meat in the diet are for those with particular constitutions, not for everyone-- therefore it still functions as a type of medicine. Or do the tantras prescribe dietary meat across the board? And btw, what is the history of the Medicine Buddha tantras? Why would we accept these over the sutras cited above?
When you go a restaurant. You have a menu -- on it are several items beef, lamb, fish, poultry, and some vegetarian items. Merely going to the restaurant that serves meat means that you are participating in the negative karma of eating meat. Why? Because they are preparing meat whether you eat it or not.

When you go a market that sells meat -- whether you buy their meat or not you are supporting them, thus you are supporting their meat sales. And on and on it goes.
I totally agree, I used this same argument in a similar way in another thread because I also believe fanatics should walk their talk in this regard. And while I do accept there are certain conditions where meat eating is acceptable and should be used as medicine, or in particular cases for diet, and for ganapuja-- I also think there is certainly a web of interconnection in the marketplace and we can't ignore that even a drop in the water creates ripples that may become quite vast. Because of this, whenever possible I try to eat at vegetarian restaurants and shop at vegetarian marketplaces. I realize this may be hard to do in certain locations, however it is not difficult where I live. Ultimately, it'd be great if some Buddhist-ethic farms developed here where bugs were not intentionally killed and dairy animals were treated with love like pets and never killed. I did meet a couple old ladies in an LA farmers market once who had a goat-dairy business, they make nice cheeses and all the goats are treated this way-- they just live till old age and die of natural causes.. none are ever sold for slaughter..
In the end, you have to do what you feel is right.
Sure.
But also you have to be aware enough that you are not imposing your idea on others. Conditioning others through your own moral sense never works.
I believe having discussions like this to clarify Buddhist views is only a positive thing. I didn't feel I was trying to impose my own view on others, however, there are Tibetan lineage masters who certainly feel strongly about this issue such as HH the Karmapa and Chatral RInpoche, HH the Dalai Lama, Paltrul RInpoche, Shabkar, etc. not to mention the lesser known ones. However, since there are other great teachers who hold a different view I try not to impose or judge anyone. Because there is a lack of consensus among the
masters themselves we are left to our own reasoning, by sharing the views of some of these teachers, or my own thoughts with others it is not an attempt to impose my view! Debate is always meant to clarify, no?

When you go a restaurant. You have a menu -- on it are several items beef, lamb, fish, poultry, and some vegetarian items. Merely going to the restaurant that serves meat means that you are participating in the negative karma of eating meat. Why? Because they are preparing meat whether you eat it or not.

When you go a market that sells meat -- whether you buy their meat or not you are supporting them, thus you are supporting their meat sales. And on and on it goes.

In the end, you have to do what you feel is right. But also you have to be aware enough that you are not imposing your idea on others. Conditioning others through your own moral sense never works.

I agree with Namdrol that the karma of wearing leather shoes, for example, is not the karma of killing.  Knowing that they are made from killed animals and not caring is the karma of not caring.  Avoiding knowledge of where they come from is the karma of willful ignorance.  Wearing them just because you like them is the karma of craving.  None of them is the karma of killing, but none of them is wholesome either.

Malcolm wrote:
As I said Keith, the point is to be aware. To understand your world. Then, if you are aware, you can understand why Buddha permitted monks in cold places from far away to wear leather. Also plastic is not better -- proof of that is BP and a chemicals industry poisoning the waterways and air.

Buddha's path is not ideological. It is about awareness. To not be indifferent. Often we must do things that are not ideal -- so, we do not remain indifferent, we do not remain ignorant, and we do not just give into craving. We bring awareness to our state.

Using electricity brings one problem; burning wood brings another. Driving a car brings one problem, riding a bike, another. Everything we do harms something else. Impossible to live completely without harming others. This is why Ahimsa from a Buddhist point of view does not involve living in a desert starving oneself to death -- it involves being aware.

Of course, we can criticize eating meat for all kinds of reasons -- it creates demand, causing others to kill and so on and so forth. But Buddha was clear -- we do not share karma. Karma is personal, and individual. If I kill an animal and sell its meat to you, I alone am responsible for that act of killing -- and not you.

Sorry, but I have analyzed in detail the contents of the bka' 'rgyur personally, so I will have suggest that my direct experience of reading many texts in this collection sutras and tantras supersedes your second hand report.

You can of course choose to read through it yourself to prove me wrong: http://www.tbrc.org/#library_work-O3JW118743JW21498 " onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;

There are six bka' 'rgyurs at the end of this link. Look there.

The only text, as I have said, in the rgyud 'bum from Avatamska is the dharani:

http://www.tbrc.org/link/?RID=O1GS12980%7CO1GS1298001JW14118$W22084#library_work_Object-O1GS12980%257CO1GS1298001JW14118$W22084 " onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;

I don't claim to say that there is no difference between them.  But when you read and hear various definitions of initiation, -and they are many and various-, it is not so obvious what is and what is not Tantra?
There are four types of initiations in Vajrayana. There are no types of initiations at all in Sutra, apart from the name "abhisheka" found in the sources referenced above, and I am sure, others Mahayana sutras that talk about the transition from tenth bhumi to buddhahood.

The four types of initiations found as described in Indo -- Tibetan sources are:

a rig gtad i.e. the simple entrustment of a vidyāmantra -- this system belongs primarily to kriya tantra.

rje gnang: this is permission right, which is a blessing of body, speech and mind. This is comes from Carya tantra, and can be applied to most deities.

There is abhisheka [dbang skur] -- this comes from Kriya tantra, is more developed in Yoga tantra.

byin rlabs -- this is a type of blessing ritual specific to Anuttarayoga tantra -- it is an abbreviated form of dbang skur, abhisheka where the outer vase empowerment is significantly shortened and the main emphasis is on the three higher abhishekas.

We might add to this, the so called rig pa' rtsal dbang of Dzogchen Atiyoga.

The names may be different in Shingon and Tendai, but the basic principles will be the same up to Yoga tantra.

Other than these aforementioned types of inititations, there are no other types of initiations in Vajrayana.

What is your opinion, is Vairocana Abhisambodhi a Sutra when it is a called by that name ?
Also some Dzogchen tantras are given the name "sutra". What counts is content and method.

When we say "Sutra" and "Tantra" we are making a distinction between methods. This does not mean that every tantric text must be called a "tantra" to be in fact a tantric text.

This is mostly confusing when we are talking about early transitional texts in the evolution of the Buddhist tantras -- for example, the Mahāvairocana abhisambodhi tantra is called a sutra in earlier, Japanese recensions.

Tantra is not dependent on the word tantra, or the word rgyud!

Malcolm wrote:
Primarily what distinguishes a tantra from a sutra is method.

Anyway, if you are still confused about this I suggest you try to read Jamgon Kongtrul's Systems of Buddhist Tantra where he makes it quite clear what the difference between sutra and tantra is.

Indrabhuti wrote down the Guhyasamaja after that point. Kalacakra is similar. Buddha manifested Kalacakra mandala in the Dhanyakataka stupa. Others wrote the tantra down at a later time. Chakrasamvara has never been connected with Shakyamuni indirectly or directly. Of course some scholars, mainly Gelugpas, in the past have gone to much trouble to prove otherwise.

It depends on  how you see it; "sutra" is merely a word, "tantra" is merely a word. In Tibet they have a transalation of the Avatamsaka Sutra in Kangyur, but they felt it belongs to the category of Tantra, and so it is found in the Tantra section of the Kangyur, not in the Sutra Section. Similarly in Japan the Vairocana Abhisambodhi Tantra is classified as a Sutra. And so on,... The Sutra Of Golden Light has also been classified a Tantra by some tibetan scholars,( this is told in a work translated by Alex Wayman).
Obviously there is oral transmission in all of the Mahayana schools, it is not something peculiar to tantras only.
Avatamsaka sutra speaks of abhiseka or initiation in the career of a bódhisattva, etc...

The abhisheka mentioned in the Dasabhumi sutra and the Lanka-avatara is only bestowed upon tenth stage bodhisattvas. It is not a method that is taught for ordinary people.

The Jains I know best live in the desert where any food is scarce, so I also reject the argument that some people 'have to' eat meat. I also reject the argument that an omnivore must have meat for good health.

Malcolm wrote:
Rejecting that argument that meat is medicine is to reject parts of the Vinaya (Bhaisajyavastu),where meat is recommended as medicine. It also is to reject the dietary and formula recommendations in the four medicine tantras where various kinds of meat, bones, etc., are often prescribed as medicine.

Some people must have meat for good health. Other do not require meat for good health. Some people require meat for repairing tissues after surgeries, others do not. There is no golden standard.

The issue is not "death" -- that is inevitable for all creatures. The issue is whether eating meat involves the karma of killing. The answer is that eating meat is not necessarily involved in the karma of killing. It can be or not depending on circumstances.

As to whether it is better not to eat meat, yes, of course it is better not to eat meat. In some places Buddha said it is ok to eat meat under three criteria. In other places he said it is not ok. And in still other places, he said it is ok. In the end it is up to each person individually. But in terms of karma, as long as you are not directly involved in slaughtering animals or happy about it, then you are free from the karma of killing -- this is what the famed Madhyamaka scholar Bhavaviveka determined.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, it is common sense. But this does not mean that one has the intention to kill, merely because one is wearing leather shoes, or killing weevils because one is wearing non-organic cotton* etc.

The point is what at what point does eating meat become negative karma? Abhidharmakosha states "Karma is volition and what proceeds from volition". When someone else kills an animal, this is not necessarily my volition.

Bhavaviveka addresses this issue at length from a Mahāyāna point of view and concludes (Yogacara Sutras notwithstanding) that meat which you did not see slaughtered, did not order to be slaughtered or was not slaughtered specifically for you by another person could be eaten with fear of karmic consequences.

This does not mean that one should not take into consideration other factors when considering one's decision to eat meat or not. It does mean that however wrong eating meat may seem to us, as long as these three criteria fullfilled we cannot say the act of eating meat is an act of negative karma.

Furthermore, of course, in Dzogchen teachings we also have methods which we can use to benefit animals whose remains find their way to our plate. Depending on our capacity, we should use them.

*organic in general does not necessarily mean pesticide free. It means that one is not using petrochemical pesticides -- it does not mean that one is not releasing ladybugs to kill aphids and so on and so forth.

There is the difference here of intention.

I know that eating meat creates the demand for animals to be killed.  Meat is evidence that killing has taken place and a person buys it intentionally to benefit from killing. There is no other way to produce meat.

In the case of vegetables etc. the intention is not to create death, nor is there direct evidence of causing killing.

If a bug flies into your windscreen when you are driving, then their karma is parrtly the cause of their death.
If an animal is dragged off to be tortured and slaughtered in an abbatoir, karma is very different  with respect to the killing.


Malcolm wrote:
When you make silk, you are intending to kill some being to make clothes, no less than hunting a tiger for its skin, or a musk deer for its musk gland.

When you grow vegetables, for example, and use pesticides, you are intending to grow food, and not kill -- nevertheless, if you use pesticides, you are intending to kill something for your convenience.

When someone eats that vegetable, by your logic they are also sharing the karma of the killing since in general it is impossible that some being is not killed and so on in the production of vegetable food.

Of course, it is easier to sympathize with animals in a slaughterhouse -- it is easier to imagine our culpability because of their suffering, so close to our own. But the fact remains that while buying meat in the market is negative, it is not a negative act of killing -- you simply cannot connect the two correctly.

Of course, if you stand by the butcher, cheer him on, then of course, it is different, you are sharing in that karma, multiplying it.

This is why I said, some of us need to eat meat, for many reasons. When we eat meat, we need to understand that it is negative and not make excuses, but it is not the case that we are intending to kill animals. It is subtle point, but necessary to understand.

Yet whoever I reveal it to, they will not understand, and so
Without speaking, in this very jungle I should remain.

He explained how this first utterance was actually an expression of Dzogchen, and elaborated on it to give us an extended Dzogchen teaching. And this was clearly coming from lineage understanding. But of course, this is not how Dzogchen is usually historically referenced.

Since this post-enlightenment utterance was recorded, it was either heard
by others or he himself recounted it (I'm not aware of the sutra source, anyone?)
So either way, the fact that it's been transmitted to us through the
ages means it is a form of teaching-- the above explanation
describes it as a Dzogchen teaching therefore he did teach Dzogchen,

These kinds of statements and teachings are referred to "ldem dgongs" i.e. "indirect intention" in Dzogchen literature.  They can be interpreted from a Dzogchen pov to support Dzogchen teaching without actually being Dzogchen.

This statement however fails to provide us with a path to realize that result in the direct manner that we refer to as "Dzogchen". Hence it is not Dzogchen.

We can also interpret Manjushrinama samgiti as a dzogchen text. It is not however as Dzogchen text and does not explain Dzogchen directly.

It is better not to eat meat.

But if you eat meat, be aware. When you are aware, there is benefit. Understand why you are eating meat. Since there is nothing that cannot be used as medicine, if you are using meat as medicine, there is benefit -- therefore, understand that in general food is just medicine to cure the illness of hunger.

When you eat meat, take care -- try not to foolishly waste meat that you have purchased, or for that matter, any food.

If you are a tantric practitioner, always do ganapuja.

Understand that the principle underlying abstaining from meat is Ahimsa, non-harming. The principle of non-harming is more important than whether or not one is eating meat. But, it is better not to eat meat.

I realize you people are right....

My christian Judaic guilt is alive and well.....hence my participation in the thread....

my justification is also alive and well......

i feel there are validity to my points though....

If your going to take the podium and tell me not to eat meat...then live like a Jain....In the sense that they seem to be more concerned with harming sentients to the point of a fault.....

so how's my guilt trip doing as per driving cars and killing insects.....

any chance of getting Namdrol to avoid cars and buses....



yikes there is a fruit truck coming to a grocery store with a bug screen one inch thick with dead bugs....

DO NOT BUY COMMERCIAL FRUIT OR VEGETABLES.....

Killing, from a Buddhist POV, requires the intention to kill. When I drive from point a to point b -- I am not intending to kill anything. Of course, it is impossible to live without harming something unintentionally. This is why the Buddha's point about karma is completely involved with intention.

Killing is the intention to end a life.

Eating meat, etc. is the intention to preserve a life.

Two different intentions, hence two different karmas and two different results.

The fault of the Jain pov is that is assigns absolute moral values to unconscious events. From a Buddhist POV this is an extreme and unreasonable view.

Still, it is better not to eat meat -- and any rational person can see that if they just stop to think about it for a second.

Of course, it is better not to drive cars too -- and any rational person can see that.

We live in the society we live in -- we can either be indifferent, defensive, or try to justify what we do -- or we can simply be aware of ourselves and how we affect the world -- limiting what is harmful, emphasizing what is beneficial.

The main point is simply being aware of yourself. That awareness is the essence of all mindfulness practices.

from my uneducated understanding,

tariffs are an extension of the law of admiralty, to regulate commerce, since most commerce is done by shipping, and then onto land, the law of admiralty continues along with the "vessel" on land, i.e. by truck ( thats why you have insurance ). the ancient law of mortgage and lien, means the owner, or loaner i.e. the bank, has 100% lien on the goods, the money, the vessel etc, the tariff means the loaner, makes money at both ends, from the purchase and the sell.

the central banks control commerce, and they by definition of the law of admiralty, remain offshore. BTW when i say offshore i mean the "district of columbia", or the "square mile" of london, or "vatican city" or "wall street".

but we already see that the central banks are the problem.

Malcolm wrote:
Historically, perhaps but since the establishment of the US, tariffs have been the means whereby the US protected it's fledging economy from the kind of commodity dumping the sparked the original Tea Party (remember, the East India Tea Company obtained permission to dump tea on the colonies at a much cheaper price than they were allowed to sell their tea for in England).

Farming in the US was healthy until Butz changed the structure of farm subsidies in the 1970's. America was wealthy until Reagan.

Now 400 people own as much wealth as 150 million Americans. Sickening.

Hi Gfreg:

The term neo-liberal is not an American term. It has only been recently employed US discourse. It was formerly used primarily outside the united states to refer to the new liberalization of international trade under the WTO. Neo-liberalism is term used to describe neo-conservative free market corporatist ideology.





gregkavarnos said:
Isn't it funny how Americans have made the terms liberal and conservative have the same meaning just by adding a neo- before them?  In Australia there are two major political parties (which once had very seperate ideologies) the Australian Labour Party (socialist politics) and the Liberal party (free market politics).  The socialists had a radical social agenda whilst the free marketeers had a conservative social agenda.

In America both the major parites are free marketers, just that the Democrats seem to have a more radical social agenda.  Seem to.  So I guess that makes the Democrats social liberals AND economic liberals and the Republican party social conservatives and economic liberals.  Of course it is almost impossible to seperate the social from the economic so the outcome is the current American reality.

On a more humorous note the word Democrat (from Greek) and the word Republican (from Latin) both actually have exactly the same meaning.  Democracy is the Greek word for republic, in Greece we do not use/have the term republic because we use/have the term democracy.

So the next time you go to vote in America you are now aware of the fact that, in reality, you are voting for the same thing either way! (I can assure you, the same thing stands for all of the worlds "two party democracies").

Heruka said:
the intrinsic value is its conventional value, its leverage value is its imputed value......

we can agree a conventional base value by some arbitary reference point, its weight, size and so on. silver for instance has a base value by its troyness and its purity and so on, its imputed projected value is based on future sales on the market. since the imputed projected price is what is traded and sold, its imputed value is inflated or deflated in day to day trading, but its rareness and conventional value, slowly and steadly increases.

most old ladies at a supermarket are not buddhists, they only know food prices have risen 30% under globalization.

Malcolm wrote:
The solution to globalization is not an ideology that informs it. The solution to globalization lies in the dismantling of corporatism, the establishment of bioregional governments, separate currencies in these regions (i.e. no world dollar), managed trade between them and so on.

As for intrinsic value, this is an incorrect term. What you mean is a standard value. That is also an imputation since it cannot be fixed.

Heruka said:
quite the opposite, true market value is based on logic and not some mathmatical complex con of leverage. if we take the market today, it is enjoying a fixed playing field, of artificial interest rates and pumped in liquidity, and not its intrinsic true value, but a created inflationary leveraged bubble. your argument is based upon the rigged casino gulag of global markets by jp morgan, goldman sachs and so forth. mine is more local and decentralized market, to hell with globalism, where the price of milk is set by the local farmer, and if another farmer lowers his price to compete, the buyer wins.

There are always limitations on markets because out of control markets can be very socially disruptive.
I agree.


Malcolm wrote:
Decentralization requires regional controls (tariffs and so on) to prevent market marauders from upsetting local exchanges and always has -- for example, corn dumped on mexico after NAFTA that forced 50,000 small farms to close, forcing people off the land into cities, then subjecting them to higher corn prices due to upward price pressure from ethanol production making it impossible for them to ever return to their farms and make a living because the investment is now too high, now that they have lost their traditional farms.

So you see, markets are not logical, they are not intelligent, and require regulation and maintenance to function beneficially.

Second, there is no such thing as intrinsic true value -- all value is conventional and imputed (can't believe I have to point this out to a Buddhist).

The reason why neo-liberal/neo-conservative free market ideology ala Austrian school is dangerous is that it eschews all market controls anywhere to ensure that market marauders can always take profits anywhere it is convenient for them to do so.

would be good topic to discuss, the merits/demerit of the Keynesian vs Austrian models of economics, i personally lean towards a individual libertarian Austrian "let the market set the value" system, rather than the gross manipulation of the other. Whether it is collectivism or capitalism, the banks get the loot.

I wonder whatever happened to code pink?


Malcolm wrote:
"Letting markets set values" is allowing the irrationality of impulse guide economic life. Limiting economic irrationality too much is not a good thing, and giving it total free reign is also not a good thing -- in the latter scenario, all that happens is the wealthy become wealthier and wealthier until the poor kill them and divide the spoils, beginning the cycle again.

There are always limitations on markets because out of control markets can be very socially disruptive.

I agree with you using the words "present free market ideology". and the key word is present. Pre 1913 america was a free market system. however the rise of the present coporate personhood and the federal reserve's ( in fact a private bank cartel not federal at all ) fiat ponzi fraud, no such free market exists today.


Malcolm wrote:
No it wasn't. Markets were controlled by moneyed interests and banksters then too. There has never been a free market, ever. For example, from 1863 to 1913, the US instituted as system of high tariffs on goods imported from Europe and so on.

Free market ideology is the very backbone of neo-liberalism. It is a fallacious doctrine, very damaging to the environment, and so on.

The present wars were started not by the liberal left, but by the neo-conservative right who bullied and fear-mongered Congress into approving these wars. If you think otherwise, you are tripping.

For the record, that is not why I opened the Dzogchen forum on E-Sangha.

I opened the Dzogchen forum on E-Sangha because there are practitioners of Dzogchen in Sakya, Kagyu, Gelug, Nyingma and Bon who, at the time seemed to need a place to discuss things separate from the Nyingma forum

The Dzogchen forum was closed because the discussion was becoming completely dominated by people from Dzogchen Community.

The Bon forum was closed primarily because one: the narrative histories of Bon and Buddhism in Tibet are largely incompatible with each other, despite many doctrinal similarities, and two: E-Sangha was a Pan-Buddhist Web site.
