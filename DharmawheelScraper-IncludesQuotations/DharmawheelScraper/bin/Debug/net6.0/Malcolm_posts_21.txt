The benefit of knowing past lives is repentance. Though it is unlikely we will know our past lives in this life, knowing our past deeds even from this life is important in developing the mind that aspires to birth:
Longer Sūtra said:
“If these sentient beings become aware of their past offenses and deeply repent with a desire to leave that place, then immediately as they wish, they will be able to go to the place of the Buddha of Immeasurable Life, where they can worship and make offerings to the Buddha. In addition, they will be able to visit all the other countless and innumerable Buddhas and cultivate various meritorious acts.

Zhen Li said:
Ajataśātru is an example of this. If you repent deeply from the deeds of this life, how much more so will you progress if you know of your negative deeds from countless prior lives? True knowledge of the evils of saṃsāra would require knowledge of past lives, so it is crucial for attaining Buddhahood to know more than one life.

Indeed, you can know your past lives by being born in the Amitābha's Pure Land, according to the fifth vow:
Longer Sūtra said:
(5) If, when I attain Buddhahood, the humans and devas in my land should not remember all their former lives, and thus be unable to know at least the events of the previous hundred thousand kotis of nayutas of kalpas, may I not attain the perfect enlightenment.

Let it be known that memory of past lives is a common attainment and not a characteristic of bodhi.

You can just look at the world of textual criticism of this sort ("Early Buddhism" is one of the best examples) to see that it quickly becomes a treasure hunt of sorts, and rarely brings people to actually practicing. To me, that is evidence enough that this approach is one that is only peripherally valuable to Dharma practice. Peripheral value like that has it's place, but once it becomes central it ceases to be Dharma practice.

Although there has been a significant growth of studies during the last few decades that showed how most of the important elements of Chan/Zen self-presentation as a "special transmission" is fabricated (and worse, fabricated with ill intentions), I have not seen anyone trying to answer that challenge, but rather things seem to continue as if such academic works did not exist at all. Although it might be that some in Japanese/Korean/Chinese academics try to work out a response. Not that it's anything new, after all, attacking the validity of the lineage was the tactics of both Tiantai and the various Chan factions.

Astus said:
There is a shared field in the accounts of past events, where the traditional story says one thing, and historical documents say another, like in the case of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moheyan. Furthermore, the very concept that one relies on a tradition - i.e. something transmitted to the present through past generations - invokes the assumption of validation through history. Only when authenticity is independent of the reliability of one's perception of history could it be said that verification of past events is irrelevant. Such freedom from historical constrains is said to be the quality of the Dharma, that it is readily visible (saṃdṛṣṭika) and timeless (akālika). The words of the Buddha are necessarily from the past transmitted to the present, therefore not free from historical circumstances, but the meaning delivered through them is immaterial, so while it is the meaning that matters more, it cannot be wholly removed from the words themselves.

Malcolm wrote:
If you wish to measure the validity of your practice through the erasures necessitated by adopting a settler colonialist perspective on Buddhist history, go ahead. But I think you will find that such histories are mainly concerned with coercion and the assertion of dominance and power over their subjects, and not really "facts." The very way you posed the question shows this, "but at least some level of recognition of the need to be able to communicate Buddhism on the highest levels of human intellectual culture of our times would be beneficial."

Where the Japanese Pure Land sects do differ from others is in seeing the definitive practice as the fulfilment of the 18th Vow.

"the fulfilled land."

I assume this is your translation of sambhogakāya-buddhakṣetra, sambhogakāya buddhafield.


Zhen Li said:
But to summarize, there is no justification at all in commonly accepted scriptures for your two central claims: 1) "[Y]ou are learning from the Dharmakāya itself;" 2)"[It] is instantaneous and beyond the need for methods that can be calculated in the normal sense of duration and ascension."

Malcolm wrote:
You too have stated that dharmakāya emanates sambhogakāya and that emanates nirmāṇakāya, and that these are distinct and yet without a difference, thus you are contradicting your first objection. [/quote]

This is a misrepresentation of my statement, unless by "dharmakāya as compassion," you are actually referring the rūpakāyas, in which case there is a difference between the three kāyas in terms of cause, the dharmakāya arises out of the accumulation of gnosis, the rūpakāya out of the accumulation of merit.


Zhen Li said:
On the other hand, attaining birth having not harboured doubt is the attainment of buddhahood and nirvāṇa, this is because it is the realisation of suchness and the dharmakāya as suchness in fulfilment of the 11th Vow.

Malcolm wrote:
This is uncertain. The eleventh aspiration only assures following a proper path, and nothing more.

Zhen Li said:
This is quite simple. As you stated, the dharmakāya emanates sambhogakāya, etc. Without the dharmakāya, Amitābha would not be a Buddha and Sukhāvatī could not be established.

Malcolm wrote:
Are you asserting then that the Sahāloka is nondual with the dharmakāya? If so, then all the benefits of Sukhavati should apply in the Sahāloka, because if you assert that Amitabha is the dharmakāya, then you must assert all buddhas are the dharmakāya, and therefore all buddhafields of all buddhas are nondual with the dharmakāya, whether they are so called pure or impure buddhafields.

Thus, the only reason there is a difference between the Sahāloka and Sukhāvati is that the aspirations of Śākyamuni and Amitabha while on the path were different, accounting for differences in their respective buddhafields. The same applies to Amoghasiddhi's buddhafield, Bhaisajyaguru's buddhafield and so on. This means these nirmāṇakāya buddhafields are only compounded phenomena, not uncompounded.

Zhen Li said:
Moreover, if the dharmakāya is limited in the way you are suggesting, then you are asserting that the dharmakāya is separate from this world, its buddhas, and is not equal to suchness. This is not Mahāyāna, but perhaps you are asserting a different doctrine.

Malcolm wrote:
The question is not the limitations of the dharmakāya, the question is the limitations of the nirmāṇakāya, since the latter appears in various realms to various beings in those realms as a result of their karma, unlike the dharmakāya, which does not appear to sentient beings at all, not even bodhisattvas on the tenth bhumi.

Zhen Li said:
As I understand, perception of the dharmakāya comes about with the attainment of the dharmakāya, realisation of suchness, nirvāṇa, and buddhahood. This is not the same as attainment of the recompensed land as effected by the 48 Vows, but it is claimed in the East Asian Pure Land tradition that the 18th vow in particular does enable one to attain the fulfilled land (Ghanavyūha if you will), but this is only because it is through the Buddha's power. Anyway, beings born in Sukhāvatī as the recompensed land are on the stage of irreversibility, they are at least on the 8th Bhūmi.

Malcolm wrote:
There are levels of irreversibility on each path. For example, someone on the path of accumulation reaches a state of irreversible generation of bodhicitta; someone on the path of application reaches a state of patience where they can no longer fall into lower realms, etc. It is quite impossible for beings to attain the eighth bodhisattva stage merely through birth in Sukhāvati. There is no justification in the sūtra for this position whatsoever. This also ignores the presence of srāvakas of various levels of attainment in Sukhāvati, bodhisattvas of inferior merit, and so on. There is also no statement in any Sukhāvati sūtra or its like which guarantees that one will be born as a eighth stage bodhisattva. Instread, it is due to the incredibly long lifespans of beings there that they are assured that they have only one lifetime before attaining buddhahood, and not because of any guarantee of immediate realization.

Zhen Li said:
The Buddha says different things on different occasions and to people with different conditions. Upāya are meant to encourage right action. Whether we take this literally or as an upāya, the point is clear: attain the three minds of the 18th Vow, attain birth in the first rank of the first grade, become irreversible.

Malcolm wrote:
The upaya card is must stand up to scripture and it must stand up to reason, otherwise one can say anything about any text that one likes. Your assertion does not stand up to scripture, since the eighteenth aspiration makes no mention whatsoever of these three minds, and further excludes those who have committed the five deeds of immediate retribution from birth in Sukhāvati, so not only does this assertion not stand up to scriptural analysis, it also does stand up to reason since if it were the case, there would be no arhats or bodhisattvas of inferior merit in Sukhāvati, unless of course you argue that they lack these three minds. But the eighteenth aspiration guarantees only that apart from those who commit the five deeds of immediate retribution, those who hear the name of Amitabha and have trust in him are granted a vision of Amitabha at death.

Zhen Li said:
This is the Tibetan Buddhism forum, so I won't push the translations of other traditions here but the Chinese recensions are older.

Malcolm wrote:
This does not mean they were accurately translated. In fact, in this early period, when Saṃghavarman was working, the third century CE, translation into Chinese was still in its infancy. Given that we have a Sanskrit version that the Tibetan reflects very well, it casts doubt on the accuracy of the Samghavarman's translation on this point. We would need to compare it with later translations of the same text to see if there is a correspondence with other recensions of the text.

The Amitābha sūtras do not specify a limit to methods practiced by bodhisattvas in Sukhāvatī, nor is there specified that they need to practice to attain the thirty-two marks, infinite dhāraṇīs, or all the supernatural powers—they have them naturally and inherently by the power of Amitābha's vows. Practicing or not practicing vajrayāna or sūtrayāna is not really a question, since "practice" Sukhāvatī is essentially just ekayāna—you are learning from the Dharmakāya itself, it is instantaneous and beyond the need for methods that can be calculated in the normal sense of duration and ascension.

Zhen Li said:
Apologies, because this is where East Asian Pure Land differs from the Indo-Tibetan tradition (in fact I initially responded to this thread without noticing it is in the Tibetan Buddhism forum, so excuse my butting in), in that the dharmakāya is considered to have two aspects:


Tanluan said:
All Buddhas and bodhisattvas have dharma-bodies of two dimensions; dharma-body as suchness and dharma-body as compassionate means. Dharma-body as compassionate means arises from the dharma-body as suchness, and dharma-body as suchness emerges out of dharma-body as compassionate means. These two dimensions of dharma-body differ but are not separable; they are one but cannot be regarded as identical.

Zhen Li said:
The other bodies are considered to be part of dharma-body as compassionate means:

Shinran, Kyogyoshinsho said:
The dharma-body is like the sun, and the light of accommodated and transformed bodies pervades all the worlds. Sun is inadequate for expressing immovability; hence, it is further said, like Mount Sumeru abide [immovable].

Zhen Li said:
In East Asian Pure Land thought, there are nirmāṇakāya aspects to Sukhāvatī but it is inseparable from dharmakāya. Of course, it goes without saying that Amitābha is regarded as a dharmakāya, which has these aspects of compassionate means.

Malcolm wrote:
Your objection is not really valid. Why? Because there is only one dharmakāya, and only one teacher, the dharmakāya, since the dharmakāya of all buddhas is the same, that is, the dharmakāya of Amitabha is not different than the dharmakāya of Śakyamuni, etc. But it is nevertheless the case that no one can see the dharmakāya other than a buddha, since the dharmakāya of the buddhas is just their complete realization of buddhahood.

Because of the compassionate nature of buddhahood, different sentient beings experience different nirmāṇakāyas, but only bodhisattvas on the pure stages, 8-10, are able to perceive the sambhogakāya, since the sambhogakāya cannot be perceived by any person who is tainted with afflictive obscurations.

As for the dharmakāya having two aspects, this is a distinction without a difference. The dharmakāya emanates the sambhogakāya, and the sambhogakāya emanates various buddhas such as Amitabha, Śākyamuni, and the other of the 1002 buddhas of the fortunate eon.

But rather than be distracted by buddhology of Amitabha Buddha, we ought to be focusing rather on the nature of Sukhāvati. 1) Sukhāvati is compounded because it was formed out of the Bodhisattva Dipaṃkāra's cultivation of a buddhafield. This is an undeniable fact. 2) Sukhāvati may be regarded as permanent, because it is sustained by Bodhisattva Dipaṃkāra's aspiration, which is limitless, given that he was an āryabodhisattva who perfected the perfections, one of which cultivating a buddhafield, however, Akaniṣṭha Ghanavyūha is uncompounded.

it is free from the experience of I and mine,

Ghanavyūha is unconditioned.

but without buddhahood in the supreme place, Akaniṣṭha,
the deeds of the buddha will not be performed in the desire realm.
Once they depart Ghanavyūha
ten million emanations of the Buddha
will always remain in yogic equipoise.

Malcolm wrote:
Thus, Amitabha also actually attains buddhahood in Akaniṣṭha Ghanavyūha. Further, unlike Sukhāvati, Ghanavyūha has no śrāvakas, since even arhats have afflictive obscurations. There is a great deal more that could be said about this.

But to summarize, there is no justification at all in commonly accepted scriptures for your two central claims: 1) "[Y]ou are learning from the Dharmakāya itself;" 2)"[It] is instantaneous and beyond the need for methods that can be calculated in the normal sense of duration and ascension."

As to your comment on your two citation, "In East Asian Pure Land thought, there are nirmāṇakāya aspects to Sukhāvatī but it is inseparable from dharmakāya."

This is unsupportable as well: the first contradiction is that if Sukhāvati is nondual with the dharmakāya, then the dharmakāya must be compounded, because beings take birth there. The second contradition is that If Sukhavāti is nondual with the dharmakāya, then it is impossible for sentient beings to attain birth there, and the aspirations of Bodhisattva Dipaṃkāra cannot be fulfilled. Both of these negative consequences arise from asserting that Sukhāvati something more than a nirmāṇakāya buddhafield. In fact, that whole point of Sukhāvati is that it is a nirmāṇakāya buddhafield, because 1) all learned people understand that even noble bodhisattvas from the seventh stage on down cannot see the sambhogakāya, must less those of us on the paths of accumulation and application, and because 2) not even bodhisattvas on the pure stages can perceive the dharmakāya since they have remaining knowledge obscurations. Since Dipaṃkāra's vows are specifically aimed at ordinary sentient beings, it is simply an exaggeration to make the two claims you have made, since they lack a basis in scripture and they cannot be defended with reason.

These rebuttals should not be seen as a negation of Bodhisattva Dipaṃkāra's vows, nor should they be seen as a rebuttal of the aspiration to attain rebirth in Sukhāvati. Rather, they are merely proffered in order to correct misconceptions that birth in Sukhāvati is somehow a short cut to buddhahood—it is not—or that birth in Sukhāvati relieves one of having gather accumulations and perfect the perfections, and so on, the normal duties of a bodhisattva on the path. In fact, as it is well known and as you admit above, some who are born in Sukhāvti do not hear the voice or see the face of Amitabha for five hundred years. This is crucial because the http://databases.aibs.columbia.edu/index.php?id=4c80390678a9883498b73fd877664edb&enc=sanskrit_romanized_title_4_search&coll=kangyur states that a single day in Sukhavāti equals a kalpa in the Sahā world. This means that those who are stuck in lotuses in Sukhavāti must remain there for the equivalent of 182,500 kalpas (500 * 365) in human time. Of course they don't suffer, but still they are trapped, cannot hear the dharma, see the Buddha and so on. This is an unimaginable amount of time.

Further, this assertion of yours that the Large Sūtra is the last remaining sutra after the Buddha's doctrine is questionable, and lacks scriptural support, despite the Chinese translation of this text.

What is known as the http://databases.aibs.columbia.edu/index.php?id=ae49b016746c95489e8507a6f8a9ee4a&enc=tibetan_wylie_title&coll=kangyur in the Tibetan canon does not affirm this, It merely states, "In the future, until the sublime Dharma utterly perishes, this great Dharmapariyaya will be truly praised by all the buddhas, extolled by all the buddhas, and conferred by all the buddhas." But there is no mention at all of it being the last surviving sūtra at the end of Śākyamūni's dispensation, as the Sanskrit (See Gomez, Land of Bliss: Hawaii, 1996, pg. 108: section 150) also bears out.

Further, the great Tibetan Buddhist master, Tāranātha (as well as other masters) clearly identifies Sukhāvati as a nirmāṇakāya buddhafield in his reply to one Geshe Paldan Śākya, "The Kusmalatagarbha buddhafield mentioned in the ninetieth chapter of the Avatamska Sūtra is the nirmāṇakāya buddhafield of Buddha Vairocana, not Akaniṣṭha Ghanavyūha, because it is explained that the buddhafield of Buddha of Vairocana has definite dimensions and is newly made, like Sukhāvati." In other words, Sukhāvati is a conditioned buddhafield, unlike the sambhogakāya buddhafield of Akaniṣṭha Ghanavyūha.

In the context of birth in Sukhāvati, no one there directly receives teachings from the dharmakāya, other than in the sense that they hear the words from the tongue of Buddha Amitabha. And of course, many beings there are not so blessed, since they reside inside of lotuses which block their sight of Amitabha Buddha for what are in human terms, eons. So while your enthusiasm for Amitabha and Sukhāvati are indeed laudable, it is misconception to claim, as you do, "you are learning from the Dharmakāya itself, it is instantaneous and beyond the need for methods that can be calculated in the normal sense of duration and ascension." Sukhavati is a pure buddhafield, but it is a nirmāṇakāya buddhafield only, it is not beyond time.

You are correct in asserting however, that from the vantage point of Sukhāvati one may obtain teachings from other nirmāṇakāya buddhafields with more ease.

I suspect that what happybuddha is unhappy about is that we disagreed with his friend and challenged their view of the Dharma as this comforting world of rainbows, love and world peace.  Again I don't think we should apologize for that in the slightest.  The starting point for serious practice of the Dharma is wanting to do something about suffering. If you think there's no (conventional) suffering, why even practice?

I agree with Ayu's comment earlier that a discussion of the view vs. conduct question is helpful.  Using statements about a very high view to dismiss the importance of conduct It is a very common misunderstanding, and should be challenged.

There are different lifespans, depending on what epoch a Buddha is born into. We are in the Kaliyuga, locally speaking, and so Śākyamuni only had an 80 year lifespan.

Anyone have any ideas what this poor frazzled mind is remembering? I distinctly remember the number 900 or 600 kalpas related to this length of time.

Malcolm wrote:
https://encyclopediaofbuddhism.org/wiki/Kalpa

We are in the Bhadrakalpa over all, and there are still 998 buddhas to come before it ends. The next Buddha is Buddha Maitreya, as we commonly know who whose advent will be either 5.6 billion or million years hence.

One tradition, seemingly based on the Maitreya Sūtra, maintains that Sākyamuni's dispensation last for 5000 years, which was halved by the admission of bhikṣunis into the Sangha, and is broken into five distinct periods—this being the last five hundred years of the Dharma. So depending on when one considers Buddha's parnirvana to have occurred, we are already beyond the date when Buddha's teaching begins to completely degenerate. However, in some Tibetan Buddhist circles it is maintained that this only applies to sūtra teachings, that Vajrayāna teachings and Dzogchen teachings in particular have a longer "shelflife."

This article summarizes various positions: https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/decline-dharma

The calculation of the length of the doctrine is a major concern, and in Tibet, almost every major scholar as tackled it.

"Whatever happens, it is good"

To break this down:

All events are good;
The holocaust is an event:
Therefore, the holocaust is good.

You can try this at home:

All events are good;
The ______ is an event:
Therefore, the ____ is good.

For example:

All events are good;
The war is an event:
Therefore, the war is good.

As opposed to say:

All events are good;
The birthday party is an event:
Therefore, the birthday is good.

The above shows that the pervasion or concomitance does not apply in the minor premise; this means the major premise, "all events are good" is flawed and refuted. I merely showed through a consequence that the premise was flawed. It is not my fault his proposition is untenable as written.

PadmaVonSamba said:
Before even that, let’s first come to an agreement about exactly what is arising, occurring, ceasing, or “coming to an end”.
Also, please note that there is no disputing that conventionally we can say that a stream (of something) has a beginning, a period of duration, and an end. Conventionally, we can say that a stream exists. We can even name streams of things, such as rivers. But moment to moment, as the saying goes, “you can’t stand in the same river twice.” The stream that existed a moment ago no longer exists. The movement may be continuous, but what is moving has already come and gone. “Gone” is what is meant by “ceased” or “come to an end”.

But when we are talking about the nature of composite phenomena, we are going beyond conventional appearances. Conventionally, you can look at a newly built house and it appears solid and unchanging. But over the course of time, that house will begin to shift and settle, the roof will sag, the walls will crack, and eventually it will collapse.
While it is standing, one can literally “take refuge” in it. One can rely on it as a source of shelter. But eventually, this will not be the case, because the house is made of components which are gradually, themselves, becoming unreliable.

What The Buddha is saying is that beings are always  looking for something that will be a constant source of satisfaction (“happiness”) and so we pursue this object or that object. That thing, or that person or whatever.
But because those objects are composites, the conditions upon which they arise are always subject to change and cessation.
Not everything in one’s lifetime is temporary. The Sun, for example, although it will burn out some day, for us it is permanent. So, there is of course a relative aspect to this.

Georgia going blue is a real possibility (Abrams barely lost the governor race), as is Florida and North Carolina. Once Texas goes blue, then it's over for the GOP. I don't see any way Republicans could win the White House anymore once Texas becomes a blue state. That could happen this year or perhaps in 2024 or 2028 at the latest.

Texas is currently 38 electoral votes and that might go up once the 2020 census is completed.

Rallies really mean nothing in this election.  First, there's the pandemic. Second, both campaigns are all about turnout in their own base, and trying to lower turnout in the other's base - Biden by highlighting Trump's unfitness for office, and Trump by voter suppression.  Of these, the single most important factor is turnout in the democrat base.  That's why HRC lost in 2016, and really she lost by a tiny margin, Trump's margin of victory was fewer than 100k votes in three counties: and even before that, post-Comey's attack on her, Nate Silver was giving Trump a 1/3 chance of winning. With those odds, Trump winning was not an upset at all.

DNS said:
I think Biden is using the pandemic excuse for not holding rallies. He's afraid not many will show up. Or he'll get some crowds, but in lesser numbers than Trump. Biden doesn't have a fervent base of supporters who literally love him, the way Trump does. At Trump rallies they are literally chanting "we love Trump." However, you're probably right, it probably doesn't matter this time around. I think Biden will win, but not because people are voting for him; but rather voting for "anybody but Trump." And let's face it, even here at DW, most of us who live in the U.S. are probably voting for Biden for the same reason: "anybody but Trump" (lesser of two evils).

The current predictions at 270towin show Biden with 290 electoral votes and 163 for Trump. If those polls are correct, even if Trump wins every toss-up state still in play, he still loses since only 270 is needed to win.

Nope, but it is an absurd position that the Buddha would certainly not support, since the Buddha spent a lot of time trying to convince people that karmic ripening could be pretty horrible, and that they ought to do their best to avoid being born in lower realms and so on. So I think that we can conclude that there is no pervasion in MOP's statement:

"Whatever happens, it is good"

To break this down:

All events are good;
The holocaust is an event:
Therefore, the holocaust is good.

You can try this at home:

All events are good;
The ______ is an event:
Therefore, the ____ is good.

For example:

All events are good;
The war is an event:
Therefore, the war is good.

As opposed to say:

All events are good;
The birthday party is an event:
Therefore, the birthday is good.

The above shows that the pervasion or concomitance does not apply in the minor premise; this means the major premise, "all events are good" is flawed and refuted. I merely showed through a consequence that the premise was flawed. It is not my fault his proposition is untenable as written.

Perhaps with this we can discuss what really happened and what the situation actually is.
On Friday, August 14, an online meeting of the Gakyil and instructors of the International Dzogchen Community took place with Yeshi Namkhai, the son of Chögyal Namkhai Norbu. This was the second meeting, the first took place on August 9, attended by international gakyil and SMS instructors, and after that additional clarifications were required for a wider audience.

At the meeting, Yeshi Namkhai answered questions about the Dzogchen Community, transmission, etc. Here is a short summary of what we heard (all mistakes are on the narrator's conscience):

1) He helped the community for many years at the request of his father - until 2014, when he left the community. He no longer intends to have anything to do with it, other than tracking the correct use of the name Chögyal Namkhai Norbu.

2) He does not consider himself obligated to support the transmission of Chögyal Namkhai Norbu in line with the traditions of the community. Doesn't want to teach within the framework and context of the community.

3) He does not believe that he is the holder of the Longsal cycle and has the right to give Direct Introduction and lungs to community practices. He believes that no one is authorized to give Direct Introduction in the Chögyal Namkhai Norbu lineage.

4) In April 2020, he was going to give an explanation of the principles of Dzogchen (not Direct Introduction) in Merigar West to specially selected novices who wanted to study Rinpoche's teachings so that they could read literature for the community. But the event was canceled due to the epidemic, and Yeshi also found that the participants had little idea that they were going to study who Chögyal Namkhai Norbu was, etc.

5) He is not religious, not traditional, does not believe in reincarnation. Buddhist traditional lineages and methods of explanation do not interest him and he does not intend to support them. This is not his life, he is a Western man.

6) Regarding the history of the Dzogchen Community, The Blue Book was written personally by Chögyal Namkhai Norbu and he [Yeshi] considered it very important. While much of it is outdated, it is still the starting point for community issues.

7) He does not intend to make any official announcements for the community, since he does not consider himself bound by any obligations to it.

Yeshi Namkhai insisted that the meeting should not be recorded in any way, therefore, unfortunately, we cannot provide you with a recording, but can only summarize what we heard.

Johnny Dangerous said:
I am nearly sure there will not be another full lockdown in most places, maybe some localized ones, but that's it. As far as what's sensible, there are levels. Just the improvement in treatment protocols and plummeting death rate I think makes it less likely that officials will go straight to severe restrictions.

I mask any time I'm near other people, and I have my "bubble" of people I have contact with. Personally, I am not just hanging out at home all the time, living my life entirely by Zoom, and don't ever plan on doing that. Why? Because you can leave your house and do stuff with reasonable safety levels. Like anything, it's a calculated risk. When I had possible Covid I more than followed the quarantine recommendations to keep others safe. The testing here is such a joke, you kind of have to.

Generally, I think people being judgemental and "Covid shaming" others is unscientific lifestyle politics, and not an evidence-based practice. When individuals do it, it's one thing, but public health officials should not be engaging in it. Basically, if someone is masking when they should, distancing when they should, the rest is nobody's business. The worst is when people blame others for catching Covid, assuming that they must have been negligent, or aren't following protocols.

This is different from criticizing the people who out and out refuse masks etc., criticizing Trump (he's idiotic) they are behaving stupidly and I'm fine with pointing that out. Beyond that though, I have noticed a very white, upper-middle class tendency to shame anyone who doesn't wanna (or can't) sit around their house and live through Zoom all day, and that is nonsense, and that is a class-based expectation, frankly. It's gross and people should stop doing it. It's especially shameful to see a bunch of supposed "liberals" getting mad at poor people who have to work. I have actually seen this kind of thing in my community.

As this guy says, the people who are saying "no big deal" to lockdowns tend to be 1) people with no kids 2) people with money who can basically live their lives from their home. 3) People who -can- social distance.. That isn't everyone by any stretch, and behaving as if it is is ignorant to what a large portion of the population has to go through with severe restrictions. Perhaps another lockdown means little to those people, but to some people it is quite a dire prospect. this is especially true in the US, just watch what will happen if there is another round of "non essential" business closure(again, thankfully I think it's unlikely) and things like eviction moratoriums end, more business close, etc. The social shitstorm of another round of severe restrictions can't be overstated, that needs to be balanced with safety from Covid, period.

Anyway, a lot of interesting stuff related to Covid and these questions comes up in the interview, it's worth watching. The guest Monica Ghandi also makes a very good point about how fear of Covid is changing social dynamics. I've found this to be very true in my own social life, so wherever people fall on this question, again, it's an interesting interview.

I'll offer an argument:

I walk outside and see a tree. The tree is physical, and I apprehend it (partly) through my physical senses.

Then at night time I go to sleep. I dream of the same tree. Being (now) only an appearance in my mind, it does not depend on my physical senses or the physical tree.

Malcolm wrote:
It is a trace impressed upon you mind because of a physical apprehension of an earlier tree. Without that tree, no dream tree for you.


tobes said:
Language can be thought of the same way. I grant that each nominal word was originally an empirical sound. However just because the first time someone said 'apple' it was a physical sound that depended upon that person's physical throat, voice, breath etc, does not mean that 200 years later, the word apple is similarly physical. It has over time become something which does not depend purely on rupa, just as the dreamt tree doesn't.

Malcolm wrote:
The word "apple" is only a vocalization, which depends upon the rūpa of two people agreeing, whether in print or in conversation, that the word "apple" refers to fruit of Malus domestica, and not a potato, the tuber known as Solanum tuberosum—though both in French are called "pomme." Hence, pomme frites refers to what we called French Fries, but literally, means "fried apple."

You are confusing concept and language, because subjectively, we have a hard time distinguishing the two. But the point that you are missing, consistently here, is that it is because of the physical structure of the nāḍīs in the body that we have a body at all, and those nāḍīs contain shapes, called akṣara, syllables, which are responsible for giving rise to speech as well as our experience of the six realms.

What you are referring to as language is termed, in the sutras and so on, as "verbal conceptuality," this means that among the trio of body, voice, and mind, speech belongs to voice, it remains physical. Verbal conceptuality on the other hand, derives from learning which sounds correspond to which objects.

To return to the Buddhist perspective, the Buddha states in the Lankāvatara Sūtra that words and concepts can be neither the same nor different. The Buddha points out that if mental conceptuality and words are the same, then concepts cannot be the cause of words, because concepts are the cause of words and words are the result of concepts (though conventional agreement, of course), and it is a standard principle that causes and their effects cannot be identical. If concepts and words are different, than the same fault applies, because there is no way a word will arise from a concept in this case. But here the Buddha never varies from his presentation that composition of words are physical, based on syllables, which emerge from eight locations: chest, throat, head, the tongue, teeth, nose, lips, and palate, and so on. And this ties right in with the distinction between karma, volition, and verbal and bodily actions, which are both physical.

The entire discussion on verbal conceptuality in this sūtra is extremely interesting, because it is also taken up the Caryāmelapakaprādipa by Āryadeva II, but these texts never present a substantially different view from Abhidharma, which regards speech and language as fundamentally physical phenomena. And of course the whole point of the discussion is to show how the personally known gnosis (pratyatmyavedanajñāna) is completely beyond expression and not within the range of words and concepts. The discussion begins with how the notion of nonbuddhist permanence is a mere verbal conception, pointing out that like the horns of a rabbit, their permanent and inconceivable entity can have no cause and no characteristic, being a mere imputation. However, when contrasted with the personal knowledge of āryas, since it has a cause, and is free from the extremes of existence and nonexistence, our permanence and inconceivability is validly established, and therefore, it is not a mere verbal conception; its is a product of noble realization.

Which gets us to the real point of why the nāḍīs are physical structures in the body. The Buddha states in the Lanka, "For as long as there is engagement with verbal conceptuality, there will be permanence and annihilation. By exhausting thoughts of verbal conceptuality, the childish views of permanence and annihilation are averted, and due to the mind being free of them, it is no more."

The purpose of elucidating the formation of the body is to elucidate the formation of the nadis, etc. Vajrayāna theory in general holds that by eliminating the eighty course conceptual thoughts—specifically in the practice related to purifying the nāḍī syllables, which are the root of all verbal conceptuality in the Vajrayāna scheme of things—this makes it more possible for us to identify personally known gnosis and have that knowledge. This is why is is important to understand why verbal conceptuality and language are not the same thing. In addition the fact, to, as I pointed out before, that language barriers are as physical as walls.

Surely what distinguishes our actions from the action of plants is intention? A plant has no intention of turning towards the light. It is a mechanical/ chemical process.

They are discrete terms because if all is mind and mind exists, it is not temporary and not likely to be dependent either. If all is mind and mind does not exist then it is some unique state beyond normal logic and reason as stating "all is mind, mind does not exist" is technically stating "all is non existent" since the mind becomes synonymous with "non existence". If nothing exists whatsoever, including mind, then it cannot be said to be dependent, nor temporary, as these words have no meaning in reference to something that does not exist at all. This is why I made the different poll options. Option 1 cannot be the same as options 5, nor 6.

Speech is physical.

PadmaVonSamba said:
The causes of events which produce vibrations on the ear drum is physical. It doesn’t matter whether it’s by a person talking or a tree falling in the forest.

And the neurological process of converting vibrations of the ear drum into electrical impulses traveling through the brain is physical.

But the experience, or interpretation of the neural activity
as speech, Identifiable sounds, as concepts is an activity of mind, of awareness.

A tree falling in the woods makes no sound if nobody hears it. It only produces vibrations of air molecules. Those vibrations can even be recorded by digital or analog means. But does any sound exist within the recorder or the CD or whatever means by which the information is stored? No. It only becomes “sound” when those signals are intercepted by the awareness of mind.

“Speech” itself is itself an abstract concept simply referring to the conveyance of information. Sign language is speech, using the hands instead of the mouth, and eyes instead of ears.

Speech is only physical when physical means are used to convey information (which is probably always) but speech itself is not physical. Otherwise, by your logic, the mouth would always be conveying information even when it is not moving and no sound is coming from it.

If you wish to understand the classical position on this point, according to the Sautrantika school, refer to the discussion on Nāmakāya in chapter 2 of the Abhidharmakosha, verse 47ab. They say, "A nāman (word) is a sound upon which persons have come to agreement that it is signifies certain things."

Your argument is realist, i.e. that there is something underlying speech called "language." But the Buddhist position is nominalist—language comes from agreement that certain sounds are agreed to represent certain things. For example, if language was in the mind, then all creatures with minds should have language, and the same language as well. But this is not the case, since formless realm beings have no language and engage in no communication at all, even though they have concepts, such as "limitless emptiness" and so on. Your name is imputed onto your body a posteriori, not a priori. There is an appearance—the nonconceptual engagement of a sense object—and then that appearance is conventionally designated; not the other way round.

Thanks, typically cogent.

Nonetheless, this only explains 'vocal actions' - the actual sounds of speech. Do you regard language itself as purely physical?

If so, then there is no inconsistency. But if not, we're left with a physical account of something that contains non-physical content.

i.e. what moves between people is not merely sounds, but also conceptual and symbolic content.

Malcolm wrote:
Meaning is not transmitted directly, mind to mind, but through the physical media of sound, physically created images, and gestures. In other words, pada, words, are the medium for artha, meaning.

Vak—voice, speech, and language, are purely physical. The word “language,” has, as its etymon, lingua: tongue/speech/language.

Likewise Vak is a direct cognate of vox, which is the nominative of vocem, “voice, sound, utterance, cry, call, speech, sentence, language, word.”

Speech likewise comes from proto Germanic *sprek, etc, utterance, etc.

For example, if I only know Tibetan, and you only know English, it is impossible for the meaning of Dharma to be conveyed, because of a physical language barrier. And language barriers are as physical as a wall.

To out it another way, meaning (dharmakaya) is conveyed physically (rupakaya), by means  of symbols (sambhogkaya) and words (nirmanakaya).

tobes said:
I still find this a bit unconvincing, mainly because it induces us to conceive of concepts themselves as merely physical.

So, there is a physical apple, which is represented by the concept and word 'apple' or 'khu-shu'. To say both the physical, fleshy sweet thing and the representation of it in a symbolic-conceptual order are equally physical misses something important about the symbolic-conceptual order, doesn't it?

What does it miss? Namely that that entire order can be abstracted from physical reality; one can have discursive thoughts containing the word 'apple' which are purely mental, and which can induce us into obtaining and biting into one. Or into a conversation about where to find and obtain one.

So it seems to me that speech mediates between namah and rupa, depending on whether one is merely involved in conceptual proliferation or whether this spills out into verbal action.

In Buddhism, there are no entities that exists outside the six dhātus: earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness. Whatever is the limit of samsara, that is the limit of nirvana, and vice versa.

tobes said:
Thanks, typically cogent.

Nonetheless, this only explains 'vocal actions' - the actual sounds of speech. Do you regard language itself as purely physical?

If so, then there is no inconsistency. But if not, we're left with a physical account of something that contains non-physical content.

i.e. what moves between people is not merely sounds, but also conceptual and symbolic content.

Malcolm wrote:
Meaning is not transmitted directly, mind to mind, but through the physical media of sound, physically created images, and gestures. In other words, pada, words, are the medium for artha, meaning.

Vak—voice, speech, and language, are purely physical. The word “language,” has, as its etymon, lingua: tongue/speech/language.

Likewise Vak is a direct cognate of vox, which is the nominative of vocem, “voice, sound, utterance, cry, call, speech, sentence, language, word.”

Speech likewise comes from proto Germanic *sprek, etc, utterance, etc.

For example, if I only know Tibetan, and you only know English, it is impossible for the meaning of Dharma to be conveyed, because of a physical language barrier. And language barriers are as physical as a wall.

To out it another way, meaning (dharmakaya) is conveyed physically (rupakaya), by means  of symbols (sambhogkaya) and words (nirmanakaya).

Tenma said:
So, I’ve been noticing people here being concerned about not using things used by samaya breakers and some texts explicitly stating to not drink the same water from them. I wanted to ask, if someone is a samaya breaker, does that mean that they will pollute whatever environments and objects they encounter? With people who aren’t even Buddhists or those who aren’t aware that such a person is a samaya breaker, what affect does this “pollution” have, if any? How is it that whatever a person such as a samaya breaker does must be avoided as though it’s harmful? Why avoid them? Aren’t they sentient beings? This entire idea of not associating with “breakers”/“deserters” sounds awfully like a cult, especially the Jehovah’s Witnesses.

Malcolm wrote:
I shun samaya breakers, you should too. A samaya breaker is someone who hates their guru, hates their vajra siblings, lacks bodhicitta, etc.  We also have a samaya to avoid such people.

Hence, Buddha's vinaya, contextual and not assembled all at once time, bears little relationship to the speculative asceticism current in the Buddha's day. For example, note his five ascetic companions were initially shocked and dismayed that the Buddha had put on weight and was eating food again.

I think this hits the nail on the head. Our self sense includes the mind borne sensations associated with the skandhas. The subtle body is our detection of the more refined aspects of the workings of the skhandas. This does not make them any more “real” in an ontological sense.
This is an interesting perspective to consider. If that's true, this would mean that anything that has an effect on the skandhas could be subtle body work... Normal shamatha, exercising, etc.

Daniel Kenny said:
Except that the “subtle body” is a construct after the event. Maybe useful as a conceptual tool, but ultimately simply a by product..like a phantom limb. It is an attempt to make sense of what in the end is a series of ephemera.
The skandhas arise in emptiness constantly and dissolve constantly.

These are clearly much lower figures than those for whom Hitler's regime was responsible. "

I think there is still a possibility to avoid this, and this hinges entirely on finding a way to discourse which loosens the deep desire to vanquish the other side; to find some way of listening - which does not entail agreeing.

Maybe Habermas is the relevant thinker here. With Kant standing behind all three.

I have little experience and mixed feeling about Rogan. The last show I saw with him was when he had that conservative congressman with an eye-patch on.

Karl Popper, The Open Society and Its Enemies

“Justice does not require that men must stand idly by while others destroy the basis of their existence. Since it can never be to men’s advantage, from a general point of view, to forgo the right of self-protection, the only question, then, is whether the tolerant have a right to curb the intolerant when they are of no immediate danger to the equal liberties of others...while an intolerant sect does not itself have title to complain of intolerance, its freedom should be restricted only when the tolerant sincerely and with reason believe that their own security and that of the institutions of liberty are in danger. The tolerant should curb the intolerant only in this case.”

John Rawls, A Theory of Justice

We have arrived at this point in both Europe and the United States.

Abstract by Alex Gardrner:
Tibetans received the teaching first in the eighth century with the translations of the sūtras, but it only began to have an impact in the eleventh century with the translation of the Ratnagotravibhāga. Conforming to neither Madhyamaka nor Yogācāra, buddha-nature has been incorporated somewhat uneasily into both, although as a positivistic theory of reality it has been more easily accepted by Yogācārin traditions.
https://buddhanature.tsadra.org/index.php/Articles/A_History_of_Buddha-Nature_Theory:_The_Literature_and_Traditions
...and... Although over the centuries Chinese and Tibetan scholiasts have categorized the concept of buddha-nature as either Yogācāra or Madhyamaka, there is sufficient reason to believe that the tathāgatagarbha theory developed independently:

It cannot  be perceived even by tenth stage bodhisattvas, since they retain a diaphanous knowledge obscuration. Therefore, it is said to be an object of faith for people like us, but not something we can ascertain directly. We can only infer it through reasoning.

Everybody that visits the website should relax their dependence on Nagarjuna’s philosophy a bit. Trying to squeeze many interpretations of Buddha Nature into Madhyamaka is like trying to put a square peg in a round hole.

Malcolm wrote:
Longchenpa had no problem reconciling Prasanga Madhyamaka, which he maintains is the definitive view, with tathāgatagarbha sūtras, which he maintains are the definitive sūtras. Likewise Gorampa asserts that properly understood the tathāgatagarbha doctrine is definitive and does not contradict Madhyamaka, but wrongly understood leads to a wrong view. Thus, these are not examples of squeezing tathāgatagarbha into Madhyamaka, if anyone is doing any squeezing, it is the gzhan stong pas who try to squeeze Madhyamaka, Yogacāra and tathātagatagarbha all into the same box, without much success, frankly.

That is, you wouldn't 'forcefully liberate' a being just because you don't like the look of their face, or they smell funny, or even because they get angry at you in an unreasonable way. It's only in particularly severe cases that this would be done, and there are clarifying qualifications or.. like there is a list of criteria that would need to be met, more or less.

With that being said. Padmasambhava or any Buddha would never kill an innocent person or even a very sinful person as a so-called provisory act, because that would become incredibly selfish and go against the precept, and set Him back, being impossible, as He has reached the state of no regression as a Buddha. A Buddha cannot commit any falsehood, no matter what.

However, according to Mahayana Buddhism (and to reason), the mind is eternal. It is not subject to gross impermanence. It changes moment by moment, but remains eternally.

Malcolm wrote:
There is a difference between "eternal" and "permanent." Nirvana, for example, is permanent, but it is not eternal. Mind streams are permanent in the sense only that they are a ceaseless continuum of moments. Space is eternal, since it was never created. All eternal phenomena are permanent as well, but not all permanent phenomena are eternal.

The civil rights movement was not purely non-violent. Some of its bravest, most inspiring activists worked within the framework of disciplined non-violence. Many of its bravest, most inspiring activists did not. It took months of largely non-violent campaigning in Birmingham, Alabama to force JFK to give his speech calling for a civil rights act. But in the month before he did so, the campaign in Birmingham had become decidedly not-non-violent:

protesters had started fighting back against the police and Eugene “Bull” Conner, throwing rocks, and breaking windows. Robert Kennedy, afraid that the increasingly riotous atmosphere in Birmingham would spread across Alabama and the South, convinced John to deliver the famous speech and begin moving towards civil rights legislation.

This would have been impossible without the previous months of courageous and tireless non-violent activism. But it is also the emergent threat of rioting that forced JFK’s hand. Both Malcolm X and MLK had armed bodyguards. Throughout the civil rights era, massive non-violent civil disobedience campaigns were matched with massive riots. The most famous of these was the Watts rebellion of 1965 but they occurred in dozens of cities across the country. To argue that the movement achieved what it did in spite of rather than as a result of the mixture of not-non-violent and non-violent action is spurious at best. And, lest we forget, Martin Luther King Jr., the man who embodied the respectable non-violent voice that the white power structure claims they would listen to today, was murdered by that same white power structure anyway.

Though the Civil Rights movement won many battles, it lost the war. Mass incarceration, the fact that black wealth and black-white inequality are at the same place they were at the start of the civil rights movement, that many US cities are more segregated now than they were in the sixties: no matter what “colorblind” liberals would say, racial justice has not been won, white supremacy has not been overturned, racism is not over. In fact, anti-black racism remains the foundational organizing principle of this country. That is because this country is built on the right to property, and there is no property, no wealth in the USA without the exploitation, appropriation, murder, and enslavement of black people.

Sure, and she could take matters into her own hands, and kill her abuser. But she would still be arrested, taken to trial, and a jury of her peers, ideally, would decide whether she was justified in killing her abuser. But the police ought not have the power to extrajudicially murder anyone. Of course, these days, the police always use the excuse of personal safety for unloading seven rounds into the back of anyone they deem a threat. And most cops who murder people are exonerated; and this means we are allowing a consistent percentage of sociopaths in uniforms to police our streets, often poorly trained, and often not very educated.

This is still extrajudicial violence, and deprives that man the right to defend himself in court. It really doesn't matter how the alleged victim feels.

Our system of justice depends on due process. Our system of democracy depends upon people's rights being protected from police violence, just as much it depends on people's rights to be protected from mob violence, such as the Tulsa and Rosewood massacres, and more recently, the public lynchings of Floyd and so many other black and brown people who are victims of racist violence, whether they are criminals or not, or the recent murder of the Trump supporter in downtown Portland, who clearly provoked his own death by spraying people with mace.

However, at the moment, law and order has been deliberately undermined by the "Law and Order" president, who himself has broken more laws than anyone can count. It is therefore not at all surprising that disenfranchised people are going to burn shit down since they have been targets of racial violence, economic violence, and state-mandated brutality in this country since 1619, and 1492, if we include native people.

Though it is claimed that the Realms and Transformations of Sound Tantra, String of Pearls Tantra, and Heap of Jewels Tantra show that the empowerments with samayas do not exist to be conferred, all four are shown in the Realms and Transformations of Sound Tantra. Nevertheless, the very unelaborate empowerment that illustrates the symbol of the mind is therefore primarily explained. Further, the result of buddhahood arises without impediment from the conjunction of a qualified guru, a disciple who possesses samaya, and the blessings of the empowerment. For example, like grain ripening after a seed is planted in fertile soil, well-tended with water, and so on, the result ripens based on not damaging samaya after the empowerment has been conferred upon one’s pure continuum. It is not enough to leave grain such as barley and so on in their ripened state; they must be harvested. Like grain being suitable to eat after it has been harvested, the crop milled, and so on, having ripened that result of the mind, it is also necessary for the guru to correctly teach the instructions. If it is asked what the purpose is of ripening and liberation, just as ripened grain will be of no benefit if it is not harvested, even if one’s continuum is completely ripened through purification, it is wasted if one does not practice the liberating intimate instructions of the guru. That demonstrates the four empowerments that ripen the practitioner, the special support along with samaya.

Malcolm wrote:

No, that is not what he is saying at all. He is following what the seventeen tantras says about samayas, not what florin says about samayas, because we are not always resting in the state of the basis. When we are not, which is most of the time, then we have something to observe and protect while we are on the path. This text by Longchenpa does not even discussion the four great samayas, it discusses only the 27 samayas of body, voice, and mind, to which all Dzogchen practitioners are subject. He says in the same text:

florin said:
As such, protect these twenty seven commitments well, and moreover, the appropriate secrets, entrusted, and the accepted secrets must necessarily be guarded like one’s eyes.

I think America must see that riots do not develop out of thin air. Certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots. But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard. And what is it that America has failed to hear? It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years. It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met. And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity. And so in a real sense our nation’s summers of riots are caused by our nation’s winters of delay. And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again. Social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention.

...It may be the case that in modern Tibetan Buddhism Dzogchen has become mixed with anuyoga teachings, especially at the level of empowerments. For example, the Longchen Nyinthig is mostly deity practices. The Dzogchen section of it is very short, only a few very short texts (Yeshe Lama is not part of the Longchen Nyinthig, though it is included in the supporting text material)...
...
...We are talking about Dzogchen as it is presented within the Dzogchen tantras themselves and their related instructions such as the Vima Nyinthig, which have zero deity yoga practices as part of the path...

Malcolm wrote:
...Finally, just because some sadhana has really pretty Dzogchen words like "ka dag," "lhun grub," etc., does not mean that sadhana actually belongs to Dzogchen teachings. A case in point is the Chetsun Nyingthig. The Chetsun Nyingthig's actual Dzogchen instructions are included only in a very short section at the very end of the root text. The rest of it is devoted to discussing the empowerment, the ngondro practice, the sadhana of Chetsun, and so on. It is a wonderful practice, excellent in every way. But when you are practicing some sadhana reciting mantras, you are practicing the two stages, not Dzogchen. This does not mean the Chetsun Nyinthig sucks, does not have blessings (whatever that means) and so on. It means that in that system, when you have finished the two stages connected with the practice of Chetsun, then you move on to actual Dzogchen preliminaries and the main practice of Dzogchen. The main emphasis of the Chetsun Nyingthig is the Guru Yoga of Vimalamitra. It is very profound. But the main practice of Dzogchen is more profound, as Vimalamitra would agree...

Hi!
I am kind of confused over Drollo in the Dudjom tradition.
There is the "Dudjom Traktung Pema Sokdrub" and also "Düddul Wangdrak Dorje Drolö".
As I understand it, they were both revealed by Dudjom Rinpoche.
Are there 2 cycles or are there only different sadhanas ?
Are there 2 different empowerments ?
Any more information on this would be most appreciated.
Thank you !

When those shocking numbers were coming out of Italy, we did see that the vast majority were elderly with preexisting conditions. The early 3%'-5% mortality estimates were way too high too. Looks like it's under 0.5%. Still high and very contagious but not the disaster we initially feared.

Malcolm wrote:
It depends where one is. In Mexico, for example the covid case mortality rate is 10+%. In the US it is 2.1%. In the UK, 12.4 percent. In Italy, 13.2%.

Figures taken from here. The CDC is not a reliable source of information. It has been compromised by radical Christians.

The nature of the mind does, but not the mind. It’s important to make a distinction between these two. When we see the ten principles of tantra being rejected in dzogcheb texts, they being rejected from the point of view of the basis, but not necessarily the path, which is why the Rigpa rangshar, the sgra thal gyur, and other tantras teach the necessity of empowerment, samaya, mandalas, and so on. The root tantra of dzogchen is not the kun byed rgyal po, but rather, the sgra thal gyur.

Yes. In fact, the reason we are in samsara now is that we did not recognize the primordial state, the ye gzhi, aka the primordial basis, to begin with. If we have not recognized it on our own yet, how are we going to recognize it now? Dzogchen tantras are univocal in asserting that one must rely in a guru, and without one, we cannot recognize our own basis independently. There is no such thing as a self-arising Dzogchen teacher, other than Garab Dorje, and he was an emanation of the Buddha.

Sometimes one's negative karma results in one being reborn in a place where one's life will be taken in an untimely way: there are three causes of death: lack of merit, exhaustion of life force, and karmavipaka, such as being murdered.

One can reasonably assume that aborted human fetuses either lack the merit to take birth in a suitable womb or that their karmavipaka causes them to meet death before they have been born at the hands of abortionist.

After all, karma is unerring, and killing human beings is killing human beings. But it does not stop the police from killing suspects, criminals from killing the police, nor soldiers from shooting each other, etc., all causes and results of karma.

So the one dude was actually a libertarian? Hmm..interesting...I kinda liked the way he presented things

Malcolm wrote:
Libertarianism has it roots in the philosophy of a guy named John C. Calhoun.

Fa Dao said:
Hang around libertarians long enough and eventually one of them will start talking about "public choice theory" (I last heard it raised by a prominent libertarian scholar to justify corporations imposing adhesion contracts on their customers to force them to buy expensive consumables and service). It's a kind of catch-all theory that can handwave away any negative outcome from unregulated capitalism, the "freedom" of which is key to a kind of libertarian thought, above freedoms like "the freedom not to starve to death".

The theory has its origin in John C. Calhoun, a proponent of slavery, and James M. Buchanan, an opponent of the civil rights movement. Both used the language of oppression and freedom to defend elitism, characterizing any kind of redistributive movement as a form of oppressive control exercised by the majority (poor people, which, in America, overwhelmingly means racialized people) against a downtrodden, endangered minority (the one percent, again, overwhelmingly white people).

The connection between the libertarian right and white supremacy is forcefully made in Democracy in Chains: The Deep History of the Radical Right's Stealth Plan for America, Nancy MacLean's 2017 book, which attracted such a vitriolic response from the genteel face of oligarch-apologism that it bears scrutiny for that fact alone — anything that pricks those consciences so thoroughly must be pretty interesting!

Malcolm wrote:

Fa Dao said:
In marking Calhoun’s political philosophy as the crucial antecedent of public choice theory, Tabarrok and Cowen unwittingly confirmed what critics have long maintained: libertarianism is a political philosophy shot through with white supremacy. Public choice theory, a technical language nominally about human behavior and incentives, helps ensure that blacks remain shackled.

Fa Dao said:
Today’s libertarians face a similar problem that Morley faced half a decade ago. Morley obviously adored Calhoun’s anti-democratic political philosophy, but obviously could not defend slavery; thus slavery simply disappears as a topic in his treatment of Calhoun’s thought. Today’s libertarians admire Calhoun and Buchanan, but they cannot possibly admit that those figures were involved in racial segregation; thus segregation disappears as a topic. We saw the same thing with Constitutional originalists: That the theory was used for decades to defend racial segregation is simply ignored. MacLean has shown how Buchanan did work in an alliance with segregationists. Public choice theorists must face up to this fact as a flaw in their system of thought or admit that they have no answer to her case. They have not yet done so.

Malcolm wrote:

Fa Dao said:
When making your case, libertarians, please spare us the Freidmanesque “It would have worked if they hadn’t given up!” None of that counterfactual stuff.

Rand’s essay typifies two problems we have encountered before in this space. First, that the thing that united (and unites) right wing thinking is its commitment to inegalitarianism: right wing thought simply rejects equality as an important value or embraces inequality as a positive good. Second, that the libertarian reduction of all rights to property rights makes them unable to adequately respond to white supremacy. Both of these aspects of Rand’s thinking are evident in her essay and in some of her subsequent writings.

In the United States, abortion is a legal medical procedure, and women who seek it should not be be penalized by being refused financial relief if they are unable to afford the procedure.

Ideally, people should try to avoid having abortions. Realistically, unwanted pregnancies will happen. It is far better for abortions to be safe and legal, than for them to be illegal, forcing women to resort to unsafe measures to end pregnancies. I personally do not favor abortion; however, I am totally against legislating religious principles into law.

The man lived a rich life of the mind — reading on the job during breaks, taking half-day walks to ponder particular intellectual conundrums, journaling fastidiously, and writing for publications. However, he never changed his views that politicians like Nixon and, especially, Reagan (first as governor, later as president) were noble and his union leaders dupes, “true believers” of false idols who demonstrated their own lack of self-confidence by joining a mass movement. Based on the limited record, Hoffer never spoke at meetings, never ran for any union office, and never volunteered in the union to help his fellow workers.

Ironically, the best-known working-class American of the Cold War era was a conservative who was lucky enough to find a job represented by the most powerful leftist union in postwar America. As such, his life represents the cognitive dissonance of many working Americans today: profiting from — albeit less so than in the past — the great gains of the labor movement yet unwilling to become union advocates.

As for Hoffer’s legacy, history can be cruel even to those who appreciate its fickleness. Today, few people know of Hoffer and fewer read him (though the term “true believer” still carries some rhetorical weight). The “longshoremen philosopher” was a powerful thinker, and the fact that he was a literary celebrity during the Cold War and consistently identified as “working class” is noteworthy.

While historians commonly associate the conservative ascendancy with Nixon and Reagan, they rarely note that the influential writings of the slightly older Hoffer predicted and praised the rise of the New Right. Scholars of Hoffer (generally conservatives themselves) inevitably note his working-class bonafides, but they don’t mention or analyze the irony of his membership in the leftist ILWU. In that way, they’re similar to all those, Hoffer included, who forgot that the labor movement brought us the weekend and much more.

Yeshe Dorje said:
I am wondering if anyone, in this context, could guess at what the Tibetan terms could be that are being translated as 'pure' and 'perfect' and if so, are there connotations that come with the English terms that don't really equate to the Tibetan words?

Malcolm wrote:
Byang is what is being rendered as "pure," "chub" is what is being rendered as "perfect." What they are squabbling about is what is termed "the basis," which in one class of Dzogchen teachings is called "byang chub sems," or "bodhicitta." They are taking this terminology from Adriano Clemente.

Byang means "purified," as is the past tense of 'byang ba, to purify or pacify. Chub pa means "culmination, realization, or understanding," hence in Adriano's lexicon, he translates it as "perfect." "Sems" usually means mind, but not here, he is translating it as "presence."

There is a very useful explanation of this term in the long Vajra Bridge commentary:

Yeshe Dorje said:
Now the, “pure from the beginning” (gdod nas dag pa) means that without the reality of the mind essence there is not an iota of a concept established within one’s continuum. Since neither faults nor taints are established nor exist in that which has never been made nor fabricated by anyone from the beginning, it is pure from the beginning.

Pure (byang ba) means that reality of the mind essence is not adulterated by any positive or negative traces. Since transient concepts of subject and object are exhausted without remainder, it is pure.

Comprehension means (chub pa) means [6/b] 1) the comprehensions imbued with the five poisons when there is ignorance or delusion about the reality of the mind essence and 2) it means the comprehension imbued with the five pristine consciousnesses when there is knowledge and realization of that reality.

The five pristine consciousnesses: since that mind essence is recognized as the dhātu that has always in inseparable in the three times, it is the pristine consciousness of the dharmadhātu that is known as one’s mind essence. Since clarity is known as the mind essence, it is the mirror-like pristine consciousness. Since one knows the meaning of samsara and nirvana having always been uniformly permeated by the sugatagarbha, it it is the pristine consciousness of uniformity. That reality exists in the continuum of all sentient beings. This being so, all phenomena of appearance and sound are distinct and bright. Since they can be discriminated as distinct and separate in ones continuum without the need to search elsewhere, it is the individually discriminating pristine consciousness. As such, as soon as one realizes, just as it is, the meaning of how that has always been, since one understands that all objects, however they exist, have always been established in one’s continuum, this is the pristine consciousness of successful activities.

That is the five pristine consciousnesses. Furthermore, the Secret Pristine Consciousness explains:

Pristine consciousness is the consciousness
of the meaning of intrinsic clarity that has never been fabricated.

[7/a] Therefore, this is the meaning of a comprehension endowed five pristine consciousnesses.

Next, because so-called “mind” (sems) is not the mind, it is the mind essence (sems nyid). The temporary concepts of mental processes arise from conditions and perish because of conditions. Being conditioned and relative, since [the mind] cannot endure and is transformed by conditions, [mind] is not ultimate.

The mind essence has always been unconditioned. The meaning of not being destroyed by conditions and never changing in the three times is that reality which clear and nonconceptual.

Malcolm wrote:
A slightly better translation of bodhicitta, byang chub sems, would be, "The mind essence comprehended as pure."

The group that claims that we should maintain a conceptual view that everything is pure are fools, very far away from the meaning of Dzogchen. They do not understand that this term, bodhicitta, is a description the realization of the pure nature of the mind, the basis, as being pure. Of course, if one is completely integrated with the knowledge of bodhicitta, then for you there is no karma and you will act spontaneously to benefit beings. But as long as one is distracted, one subject to affliction and action and its results, as is explained in the definition provided by the author of that text, Kunzang Dorje.

Vikranta is the past participle of vikrama [vi-kram] whose first meaning is that of step, march, stride, as well as pace (not sure of this last one but it seems the meaning is also that in chinese). In this dharani, the infinite stride is to be counted as among the auspicious signs, qualities, or capacities of the Buddha. For instance, his stride (in French  one would say: “son allure”, "son pas", “son enjambée”) is like the sauntering stride of an elephant, causing the earth to tremble (“Asceticism and the Glorification of the Buddha’s Body”, p. 14). Or it can be the strides of a lion (op.cit., p. 16; "Indian Buddhism through a Chinese Lens", p. 98-99):
gajapatigatigāmī siṃhavikrāntagāmī Sauntering with the gait of the lord of elephants, with the strides* of a lion

Lichtman’s model has successfully predicted the winner of the popular vote in every presidential election from 1984 to present, with the exception of 2016. In the contested election of 2000, the system predicted the popular vote winner, although not actual winners. As a result in 2000, he predicted using his system that Gore would be the next president; Gore won the popular vote but lost the electoral college.[3] In September 2016, the Keys forecast that Donald Trump would win the popular vote in the 2016 election, whereas he lost the popular vote, but won the electoral college.

Professor predicts Trump will win in a landslide.
https://news.stonybrook.edu/facultystaff/maverick-modeller-helmut-norpoth-predicts-another-win-for-trump/
Norpoth, a professor in Stony Brook’s Department of Political Science, has enjoyed notable success forecasting elections based on his Primary Model, a statistical representation of U.S. presidential races based on data going back more than a century.

The Primary Model has correctly predicted five of the past six presidential elections, and when applied to previous elections, correctly predicts an impressive 25 of the last 27, missing only the 2000 election in which George W. Bush defeated Al Gore and the 1960 election in which John F. Kennedy defeated Richard Nixon — two extremely close and contested votes marred by allegations of voting inaccuracies.
The model appears to have good success, but how can he put Trump so likely to win based on his primary wins? He was basically running unopposed for the GOP nomination, as an incumbent. Tradition has it that no one runs against the incumbent from the same Party (with only a few exceptions; Ted Kennedy in 1980 and maybe a couple of others).

One thing I do like about this model:
Unlike many other projections, Norpoth’s equation ignores approval ratings.
Surveys on approval ratings are very subjective and change too quickly.

So now you can understand the real reason teachers recommend purification practices to their students when they become ill. It certainly isn't for their own benefit in order to live longer.

There are many instructive lessons here concerning the vicissitudes of the the tulku system, especially when incarnations are recognized outside of the Tibetan cultural sphere.

In the article which i quoted, he reflects on the drawbacks of the state taking over many of the functions previously performed by charities and the overemphasis on notions such as rights and justice (which often come about with a sense of entitlement). It was meant to be a continuation on arguments i made on previous paragraphs about how to motivate the rich to contribute more to society while minimizing the role of government.  I personally give no weight to what he does in his personal life.

Malcolm wrote:
We should not minimize the role of government. That is ridiculous. The job of the government, according to Nozik's Anarchy, State, and Utopia, is primarily to provide security and protect markets. However, when business itself is the main threat to healthy markets, business needs to be regulated, and governments enlarged to make sure these regulations are properly enforced.

The best way to motivate rich people do beneficial things with their money is to tax them on all assets in excess of say 15 million. If one cannot lead a decent life with 15 million, one is just a selfish prick. But let's say you have 100 million of personal assets, and you are faced with a choice of either give 85 to the feds, reinvesting it in a business, or setting up a charitable foundation (but not like say, Build the Wall), etc., then of course, make as much as you want, but anything above a certain number really isn't yours. You know, like during the Eisenhower years.

Here is the first of snips from Kengor's Guide - this one on religion in general:
The Communist Manifesto said that, “Communism abolishes eternal truths,
it abolishes all religion, and all morality.” Marx and Engels envisioned a new morality without God, one
based on “the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.” The things that communism promises are
entirely unnatural, completely contrary to what human beings had believed before, and even to their very
humanity itself. It was intended to transform human nature.

Nicholas, you have apparently neglected to read the Buddha’s assertion that Dharma can not be destroyed from without,  only from within. The PRC’s recent actions are wholesale, aimed at erecting the cult of Xi, replacing all religion in the PRC with it. It’s not really about religion. They don’t care about religion beyond the fact that religious groups tend to be more resistant to mundane authorities. The PRC is acting no differently than any other entity seeking to control a market.  Your focus on ideology misses the point entirely. Ideology is not the cause here, it’s the excuse.

Could you please elaborate on the difference between a humanist/secular utopia and the older religious notions of heaven and hell?

Or to put it differently, why communism is not a religion where faith in the state or progress replaces faith in the God of the Abrahamic religions?

Here, Marx's views on religion might be relevant:.

PeterC said:
I would hesitate to get into analysis of that work of Marx’s because the meaning is not obvious.  The work he’s discussing - Hegel’s elements of the philosophy of right - is really, really difficult. Not many people really understand it. And that essay that Marx wrote, he never published, we don’t know if it’s because he wasn’t sure about it or because he didn’t get around to it.  That part you’re quoting is heavily debated, and there are multiple different interpretations of it.

If you want to understand the ideas of Marx on religion that aren’t contested, you need to go back to Capital. It’s clear that he wasn’t very interested in metaphysical questions - the truth of the *claims* of religion weren’t very important to him, what he was interested in was the *function* of religion.  He saw it as both part of the ideological control mechanism that the ruling class created, and also as a means for the proletariat to express their unhappiness in a way that didn’t threaten the relations of production.  It was part of the dominant ideology in his theory.  That functional view of religion was actually a pretty fair representation of its role in society for centuries, and you could argue it still explains quite well the role of religion in society today.

He was primarily concerned with the role of the dominant religion. He didn’t have much to say about conflicts of beliefs, minority religions or pluralistic societies.

The thing to understand with Marx is, as Malcolm said, that for him the communist society was the end-point. He actually said very little about what it looked like. He spent most of the time analyzing where we are now, how we got here, what makes the current society persist, and what will eventually change it. (The answer to that last question is: development of technology.)  He was an extraordinarily insightful writer, and said a lot that was very relevant to understanding the failures of society today.

Bundokji said:
Hegel's work itself is known to be notoriously difficult to read, hence Marx's reflections on aspects of his philosophy would be equally difficult to understand.

More than 20 years ago, i bought "Capital" which was divided into five parts. The copy i bought was in Arabic, and i am not sure if it was bad translation or that the work itself is difficult. I remember after reading some 30 pages, i began to encounter mathematical formulas, so i gave up! This is why, i have sympathy with people who do not refer to primary sources.

I agree that his description on the role of religion in society is largely accurate, but i also see the drawbacks of linking it to the ruling class. My main issue with this approach is that it somehow excludes the ruling class from being equally deluded by the weaknesses of the human condition (greed, fear and ignorance), or that if the proliferates came to rule they will be radically different.

And then we could try and find a translator that would be willing to translate it all into English..I would be willing to chip in whatever I could for a project like this to donate to a Lama and pay a translator...just want to see if there would be any interest from any of Rinpoches students for this....

Fa Dao - I think if you wanted to practice Longde in ChNNr’s lineage then you’d want the lung of the first volume of the Longsal terma cycle, which contains ChNNr’s upadesha on the vajra bridge.  (Correct me if I’m wrong about the content of that.)

Could I suggest a slight variation on your plan. We track down members of the DC who have received the lungs of each of the Longsal teachings - and since they were given at different times in different places, that means a group of people, it’s highly unlikely one person will have received them all - and we organize a mass lung of the whole lot.  People can seek out explanations afterwards, but we ensure that the reading transmissions have been given.  The only requirement to give a lung of a text is that you’ve received it from someone who has received it.  So we don’t get into the contentious question of DI, but we do what we can to ensure the termas are propagated.

I would also be willing to contribute to the costs of this.

Which coincided with a more fluid interpretation of man, time, history and the nature of reality during that era, and preceded by a gradual shift towards a more scientific and objective mindset. The faith in human progress seems to be justified by rapid scientific and technological advancements associated with deconstructing the old and limiting belief system.
I remember reading that communism necessitates feudalism and capitalism as historical conditions for its applicability.
That is the historical materialist paradigm which was part of Marx's theory.  The neo-Marxists believed that communism could be reached without going through this process, by relying on peasant class (in less industrialised societies) instead of the industrial working class as the motor for change.

What interests me in the current conversation is whether the claims of wide-spread racial discrimination are true and whether they add up to be a significant impact on the welfare of the Black and other minority communities, or whether it is largely entrenched poverty and disadvantage, as I've said. Because, if it's the latter, then the conversation about race should not hog all the oxygen, and rather people should talk about removing the obstacles kids in disadvantaged communities face, rather than rambling on about racist white people.

Maybe that's an ok thing that things go in a smaller direction.

Russell said:
Yes, the organisation is there to support the teachers and the students, not the other way around, so if it needs to shrink a little we adapt to that.

I think this is the point, it takes time for the DC as a whole to recognise and give up their expectations, and when one does that one can see there really wasn't much fault in how things were handled. I'm not telling you to shut up or relax, just what worked for me.

Johnny Dangerous said:
It's not about fault, but about where to go from here, and not pretending things are something they aren't. Presenting an honest assessment of the situation to the membership at large. Basically it looks like it's going to be  a bunch of smaller groups with nothing left to unite them -if indeed there is no heir and no further transmission. Why would it go otherwise?

Speaking for myself, why would I be interested in that if I don't live near a gar or ling and have connection there? Other than the lightning bolt spiritual experience that was regular  DI and participation through webcast with Rinpoche, I know the DC members on this site more than I know anyone else in the DC, by far. There is no real mechanism for that to change. I imagine I am not the only DC member at large in this sort of situation. If things go this way, what is even the purpose of a general membership model, without a central transmission or teaching?

Without transmission being the thing that holds people together, nothing will look the same, and people like me will have little reason to remain members, without some major attempt at new ways of doing things. Yet, the communication tends to always emphasize the transmission we share, even emphasizing paying dues as a part of the responsibility of sharing that transmission! You can't on the one hand celebrate us all being unified through the transmission we were fortunate enough to receive from Rinpoche while also saying it's done with, and everyone is going to do their own thing, but that we should still support it the same as before. That's just crazy. That's the Head In The Sand approach I was talking about.

Some of this is just logisitical. For instance, if long time SMS teachers offer a class on Rushens or something, if it happens in a centralized location, accessible to DC members generally, this is a different than the more conditional offerings which seem to have gone on so far. The Webcast page has offered some interesting stuff, but simply trying to sort it is a task. If they want to go to a membership mode where transmission is no longer central, reorganization like this should be central to it. There are some real strengths too. I've personally had SMS teachers answer my questions through email over the years, and their help was vital to me - that sort of thing is serious juju. So I don't mean to sound purely discouraging, just realistic.

I don't want to blame anyone, I'm sure everyone is trying their best and no one means anything but their best intentions, but someone needs to seriously fix their messaging. It may be bitter medicine to hear that, but sorry, it's how I see it. I feel these are valid and somewhat obvious points that get shot down out of "being respectful" "being calm" "not assigning blame" etc. But this is kind of where the rubber meets the road, isn't it?

The point that I'm trying to convey is that, in my opinion, a generous free speech is a safeguard against authoritarianism. Stifling speech is a method of authoritarianism - we all know about Trumps disdain for and attacks on journalists. The problem is *who* exactly is going to regulate speech. You want laws with punching power? Great, but don't be surprised when it's used by people you don't like.

Malcolm wrote:
The US has the most generous free speech provisions in the world. The freedom of the press is written into the constitution.

However, free speech does not include the right to violate civil rights: for example, if one uses slurs against black and jewish people in one context, it is permitted, for example, among your friends, an internet forum, etc..

If one uses the same slur to verbally assault a black or a jewish person, this is a felony punishable by jail time, even on an internet forum, etc.

If you are generally raving about Rothschilds and ZOG, well, you are an idiot, but in the US, it is not a crime to be an idiot. If someone comes on your forum and you attack them with slurs, you could be facing jail time if they can afford a lawyer, etc., etc.

In fact all speech is regulated; most of it is self-regulated, by custom and convention. Some speech is criminal, demonstrably harmful and misleading speech, like false advertising, crying fire in a theater, etc. There is lots of speech others consider harmful, like forums devoted to ethnostates, but the argument here that some are making is that such speech deserves to be included amongst harmful speech. This is a legal question, since it has not been brought up in court as far as I know. But I think it would very hard to pass laws against this in the US.

However, in private forums, holding that speech which advocates for such things ought to be banned is perfectly fine. Free speech only extends to public speech, not private speech.

Now, I understand you are not advocating for ethnostates personally, but you are making an nonargument. If the gods of this forum decree there shall be no discussion of ethnostates, then there will be no discussion of ethnostates, etc. And such a drecree violates no one's free speech rights because we are all here voluntarily.

Suppressing Milo talks is perfectly fine. Milo is an asshole. No one has ever made it illegal to shout down your opponent. This is essentially what is happening with these alt-right douches, they are being shouted down, and rightly so. Some glass might get broken, but that is what insurance is for.

Of course, we know that you were raised under communism, and I think we all agree that any totalitarianism, whether it is right-wing totalitarianism, i.e., fascism; or left-wing totalitarianism, i.e., communism, or religious totalitarianism, i.e., Wahabism, Fundamentalist Christianity, etc., are fundamentally evil death cults.

On the other hand, we do have to keep in mind that the Buddha himself proclaimed the demise of the Dharma within 5000 years. So there is that.

Fascism was well defined by Umberto Eco:

Matt J said:
The cult of tradition. “One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist, syncretistic, occult elements.”

The rejection of modernism. “The Enlightenment, the Age of Reason, is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense Ur-Fascism can be defined as irrationalism.”

The cult of action for action’s sake. “Action being beautiful in itself, it must be taken before, or without, any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.”

Disagreement is treason. “The critical spirit makes distinctions, and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.”

Fear of difference. “The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.”

Appeal to social frustration. “One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class, a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation, and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.”

The obsession with a plot. “The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.”

The enemy is both strong and weak. “By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.”

Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. “For Ur-Fascism there is no struggle for life but, rather, life is lived for struggle.”

Contempt for the weak. “Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.”

Everybody is educated to become a hero. “In Ur-Fascist ideology, heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.”

Machismo and weaponry. “Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality.”

Selective populism. “There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.”

Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. “All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.”

BTW, "Sources substantiating claims about "Hindus" not achieving liberation" is a misstated question.

Think about it. What do Buddhists claim liberation is? It is very simple, and all Buddhist schools, including Dzogchen, agree that liberation is freedom from affliction that causes rebirth in samsara. There are schools in Hinduism that agree with this proposition also.

But where do they disagree with Buddhadharma?

Hindu schools do not agree with how Buddha defined rebirth, or with how Buddha presented karma, or Buddha's presentation of dependent origination, and they reject the Buddha's assertion of two-fold emptiness. Thus, how could they possibly be discussing the same liberation as the Buddha? It is quite impossible actually.

So it is very simple to examine what various Hindu Darshan's claim about liberation and the procedures for realizing it. When you find a Hindu school that is not Buddhism that presents essentially the same message as Buddhism on rebirth. karma, dependent origination, two-fold emptiness, and so on, please share your research with us. As far as I know, that only nonbuddhist school which agrees with Buddhadharma on all of these points is Bon.

Until then, this conversation is fruitless.

This means that there are no awakened people outside of those who follow Buddhadharma. Some people may object, "what about pratyekabuddhas?" A pratyekabuddha is a kind of an arhat who previously generated to the bodhicitta aspiration to achieve awakening in a future rebirth, even though a samyaksambuddha had not taken birth in the world.

PeterC said:
…but provides no further discussion of ayatana. So that seems straightforward.  So on to dhatu, the definition of which above isn’t immediately obvious:
Dhatu signifies gotra, race, lineage. In the same way that the place, the mountain, where there are many ‘families’ of gems – iron, copper, silver, gold – is said ‘to have numerous dhatus’, in this same way in the human complex or series, there are eighteen types of ‘families’ which are called the eighteen dhatus.
Gotra is thus a mine. …
The dhatus are the mine of their own species: the eye, being a ‘cause similar to its effect’ of the later moments of the existence of the eye, is the mine, the dhatu of the eye.

I find this analogy distinctly unhelpful.  It then says that the unconditioned things are dhatu in the sense that they are “the mine of the mind and mental states”.  This seems inconsistent – wouldn’t that associate them with the mental consciousness?

Malcolm wrote:
This is actually a really important point, and shows why English translations of the term dhātu as "basic space" and so on are entirely inadequate. So, for example, the six elements are called the sadadhātu—earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness—grouped together because these elements are of the same grenre, or family. Likewise, there are the genre of the mind, mental consciousness, and mental factors, etc. Uncompounded dharmas are in the dharmadhātu, because they are strictly objects of the mind and mental consciousness. In this way, the three uncompounded dharmas are the of the same genre as 49 of the 51 mental (excluding sensation and perception, which are treated separately because they are also indriyas). In Tibetan, the term dharmdhātu in this context is translated as chos kyi khams, literally "dharma element," whereas in a Mahāyāna context, it is translated "chos kyi dbying," "source of phenomena" (all Tibetans gloss dbyings as a 'byung gnas, a place of production, which resembles the definition of a mine.)

I have a question about feelings. I wanted to know what Buddhism says about it. I heard it said that we don’t genuinely feel anything during meditation. Does this mean that how we feel about events and things that happen to us is not real? Another person told me that we don’t genuinely feel things in meditation because nothing is happening to cause such feelings but that out in the world we do because there is something happening. Is this true? What does it have to say in regards to our feelings, which some (including me) think are important to navigating the world and helping us decide.

For me and for my practice it doesn't really matter, whether or not Sakyamuni was a historical person or not, but my friend who is on the beginning of the Dharma journey asked me if there`s a proof for Sakyamuni`s existence as a historical person, and it seems to matter for her, as she`s a beginner and doesn't have sufficient confidence in the Dharma and practice yet. I realised that in spite of 24 years of me practising I have never actually checked that out as it never mattered to me.

Fa Dao said:
Indian Country reacts to retiring of Redskins name and logo

The Washington NFL organization announced on the morning of Monday, July 13 that it was retiring its Redskins name and logo.  Following are comments and statements from leaders and organizations throughout Indian Country on this decision:

United South and Eastern Tribes (USET) President Kirk Francis
“USET SPF is encouraged and heartened that, at long last, this disparaging and racist word will no longer be used in professional sports.  We extend our deep gratitude to all the advocates and allies who never wavered in their efforts to achieve today’s win.  While it should have been relegated to America’s racist past long ago, we welcome this change as an opportunity for education, growth, and reconciliation, as the nation acknowledges its historic and ongoing shameful acts against tribal nations and Native people.  It is our hope that the team’s new name and logo will truly reflect our evolution as a society.  Bottom line, our people and cultures are not mascots and the time is long past due for us to be properly respected, not only within sports teams, but in all aspects.”

National Congress of American Indians
“Today is a day for all Native people to celebrate.  We thank the generations of tribal nations, leaders, and activists who worked for decades to make this day possible.  We commend the Washington NFL team for eliminating a brand that disrespected, demeaned, and stereotyped all Native people, and we call on all other sports teams and corporate brands to retire all caricatures of Native people that they use as their mascots. We are not mascots – we are Native people, citizens of more than 500 tribal nations who have stood strong for millennia and overcome countless challenges to reach this pivotal moment in time when we can help transform America into the just, equitable, and compassionate country our children deserve.”

Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez and Navajo Nation Vice President Myron Lizer
“For generations, this team name and logo has misrepresented the true history and events that define the term ‘redskins’.  History tells us that the term ‘redskins’ derived from bounty hunters, which identified Indigenous peoples by the color of their skin.  Bounties were offered for the murder of Native Americans.  Bounty hunters killed Native Americans, referenced as ‘redskins’, and brought to the market the stained, bloodied scalps in exchange for payment.  This is the tragic and disgusting history that the world is not often told.”

Navajo Nation Council Speaker Seth Damon
“The changing of a national football franchise’s name is no small accomplishment.  Today, we commend the work of Suzan Shown Harjo, Amanda Blackhorse, and others that have continued to push for this moment since 1992. The term had become so normalized to American society that it forgot, or thought it could dismiss, the violent and bloody history behind the very word.  Throughout the years, we’ve continued to hope that a retired Washington ‘Redskins’ team name and logo could become a symbol of greater understanding of the misrepresentation that many Native nations continue to face today.  No amount of symbolic ‘honoring’ can undo decades of cultural appropriation that have followed on the coat tails of centuries of extermination and exploitation.”

Ho-Chunk Nation President Marlon White Eagle
“We thank FedEx, Nike, corporate sponsors and all of those involved in this historic change. As Indigenous people inherent to this land called the United States of America, we have for a long time been portrayed and characterized in a negative stereotype.  We are not mascots.  The name change is long overdue.”

Billy Mills, Olympic Gold Medalist and National Spokesperson for Running Strong for American Indian Youth
“It’s never too late to do the right thing.  Now, I urge the Washington football team to truly turn the page and pick a new name and logo with no exploitation of Native people.  They are on the verge of righting a historic wrong.  What they do next will define this team’s legacy.”

Ponca Tribe of Nebraska
“The Ponca Tribe of Nebraska is encouraged that this long-overdue moment has arrived, with one professional sports franchise abandoning a mascot that perpetuated a racial slur and another examining how Native American mascots are offensive and have no place in our society.  Using Native Americans as sport mascots and our deeply meaningful symbols, including headdresses, are inappropriate.  Advancing troubling stereotype in popular culture and society, via sports, diminishes our personhood.  The Ponca Tribe of Nebraska is hopeful that other sports franchises will make the right decision by ceasing their use of derogatory and offensive mascots, and thereby examining their own use of mascots, chants, symbols, and themes that disparage our people.”

Crystal Echohawk, IllumiNative executive director
“This is 30 years in the making, and we honor the leaders of this movement, Suzan Harjo and Amanda Blackhorse, and important contributors such as Dr. Stephanie Fryberg, First Peoples Worldwide, and thousands of other Native organizations, people, and tribal leaders who have fought for this.  Tomorrow, our fight continues.  We will not rest until the offensive use of Native imagery, logos, and names are eradicated from professional, collegiate, and K-12 sports. The time is now to stand in solidarity and declare that racism will not be tolerated. ”

Malcolm wrote:
There are so many more, and the WSJ reports that 67 percent of people who identify as native find the name offensive, so...maybe you know the other 33 percent...

Malcolm wrote:
It will be covered, but in brief, very intelligent people can infer the other two from the skandhas. Very good mediators can meditate the dhatus more in depth, since the dharmadhatu contains all the compounded and uncompounded dharmas, other than the matter, sensation and perception aggregate, and it breaks out the six sense consciousnesses from the mano ayatana.

Recall, the whole purpose this to undermine the notion of self of the person. So, put another way, if one’s material aggregate includes all sense objects, it isn’t really “one’s” material aggregate.

PeterC said:
14a-b. These same organs and objects are regarded as ten ayatanas, ten dhatus.
Ok, I’m a bit lost here. Why ten and not twelve?  Are manas-ayatana (mind) and dharma-ayatana (thought) excluded?  The list in the text mentions sprastavyayatana and sprastavyadhatu at the end of the list, so…presumably that makes ten?  I guess this is because we haven’t yet discussed citta, and because although we’ve discussed avijnapti we haven’t yet discussed how this becomes dharma?

Malcolm wrote:
[/quote]

We are only talking here about the material skandha, that which is made of the four elements: the five sense organs and five sense objects. And let that sink in. If the five sense objects are part of our material skandha...

Then there’s a long digression in the commentary of which it’s probably worth noting:

PeterC said:
Also the Blessed One said, “The updanaskandha called samskara is so called because it conditions conditioned things,” that is to say, because it creates and determines the five skandhas of future existence.

Malcolm wrote:
So we continue with the definitions:

PeterC said:
15b-d. These three skandhas, with avijnapti and unconditioned things, are the dharmayatana, the dharmadhatu.
(Commentary) Vedanaskandha, samjnaksandha, samskaraskandha, plus avijnapti and the three unconditioned things (extinction through analysis, extinction not through analysis, and space), are seven things which are called dharmadhatu.

Malcolm wrote:
So now we have almost the full set, and go on to define the aggregate of consciousness.

PeterC said:
16a. Consciousness is the impression relative to each object.
(Commentary) Vijnanaskandha is the impression relative to each object, the “raw grasping” of each object…(the) six classes of consciousness.
(footnote) …it grasps the blue, etc. but does not say that it is blue, etc.
The text then explains that considered as an ayatana it is the mental organ; considered as a dhatu, it is the dhatus of the five sense aggregates plus manovijnanadhatu plus manodhatu.  I found this a little confusing.  There is a three-part system – object/faculty/consciousness. Isn’t it duplicative if this skandhas contains both manovijnanadhatu and manodhatu?

According to one of my Teachers in Kham, there is a Jigme Lingpa ngakpa ordination that one person can only give to 13 others in their entire lifetime.

That Teacher always wears the whole ngakpa kit. However, I know one of his Western students who asked for this ordination and then asked to be excused from some of its vows. Personally, that seems like a real contradiction.

Many Dharma Teachers will specify what clothing They want Their students to wear when. If the Teacher has given explicit teachings on this, then following those treaching becomes a samaya. For me, that's the end of discussion.

Because I have different Teachers with different points of view on this, I wear different clothes when I'm with different Teachers. No big deal.

Thanks - that makes sense.  So it’s the formation of karma from intent?

Malcolm wrote:
The way the Sarvāstivādin's conceive it, taking vows causes a material change of state of the material aggregate. One cannot perceive it, hence it is called avijñāpti-rūpa, imperceptible matter.  When the vow is broken or relinquished, this causes another change of the state of one's material aggregate.

Sautrantikas reject this idea in toto. They say, simply, vows are intents, until they are disrupted by another intent. This is actually the basis for the Tibetan Buddhist position that the five upāsaka vows cannot all be broken if one is broken, and one can keep one, two, three or all, depending on ones situation.

I'm a bit curious why this subject generates such strong emotions.

I remember wearing my zen and getting called out. Who gave you the zen? In what context? Why are you wearing that? Do you know what that means? Then on a different occasion, not wearing my zen and getting called out. Why aren't you wearing your zen? Don't you take your vows seriously? Don't you know that this is a commitment, a vow?

I've found few things in Tibetan Buddhism that draws so many projections.

It seems I've been either having this conversation, or listening to it from afar, for decades now.

If that is one's criteria, then most certainly the royal bodhicitta motivation is "superior."

As for the Buddha manifesting birth in Lumbini, this was not a real birth of a real person. Buddhas do not attain buddhahood in the desire realm. This is clearly stated in the Lankāvatāra and other sūtras. They attain buddhahood in Akaniṣṭha Ghanavyuha.

Śākyamuni Buddha's twelve deeds were like a puppet show, where mud and sticks are assembled to create an illusion of kings and queens, horses and elephants, and so on. A necessary illusion, but an illusion nevertheless.

But I am frankly appalled by the president’s recent tweet seeking to postpone the November election. Until recently, I had taken as political hyperbole the Democrats’ assertion that President Trump is a fascist. But this latest tweet is fascistic and is itself grounds for the president’s immediate impeachment again by the House of Representatives and his removal from office by the Senate.

For example, royal bodhicitta is the motivation to attain buddhahood as fast as possible in order to able to help sentient ad infinitum, but Buddhas do not take rebirth. Rebirth is a samsaric process to which only bodhisattvas below the eight bhumi are subject. Eight stage+ bodhisattvas have power over birth as well. There is of course the captain motivation, vowing to attain buddhahood simultaneously will all sentient beings, and the Shepard motivation, vowing to make sure all sentient beings attain buddhahood before oneself. In Vajrayana, we generally consider the first of these three to be the most skillful.

My friend, by now you should know that Shantideva is just another pinko commie.  For instance:
What need to mention the wish to relieve each and every limited being of fathomless miseries, and the wish to help each and every limited being to actualize fathomless good qualities (1.22)
But how’s he going to pay for all of this relieving beings of miseries?  He’s just going to blow up the deficit.  We need fiscal discipline.
Throughout my beginningless samsaric existence, in this and other lives, I’ve unwittingly committed negative acts or caused others to commit (them) , and further,
Oppressed by the confusion of naivety, I’ve rejoiced (in them) – whatever I’ve done, I see them as mistakes and openly admit (them) to you, my Guardians, from the depths of my heart.(2.28-29)
This cancel culture has really got out of hand. Now we have to apologize for things that were done before we were even alive?  I’ve always treated sentient beings well.  Some of my best friends are sentient beings.
So long as wandering beings fall sick, may I serve as the medicine, the doctors and their nurse, until they’ve been cured of their illness. May I eliminate the pain of hunger and thirst with a shower of food and drink; and, in the times of the middle eons of famine, may I myself change into food and drink. (3.7-8)
After the failure of Obamacare we all know that socialized medicine doesn’t work.  I mean, look at Canada, people are dying in the street there!  And this talk of providing food and drink for free - this is just going to create another generation of welfare queens.
People who are disturbed by sickness are powerless over all their actions. Those whose minds are disturbed by bewilderment are likewise powerless over all their actions. (4.24)
We cannot be letting people use insanity as a defence for crimes.  We need to be tough on crime.  Without law and order, we will have anarchy.
There've been many people with material wealth and there've been many with fame and reputation. But it's never been known that they've passed on to some place where their amassed wealth and fame have come with.
Now he’s putting down the job creators that fuel our economy.  When did we stop looking up to successful people in this country?
As many women as there are in the world, may they attain the status of men; and may the lowly attain high position, and the arrogant become humble.
There are those in this country who still hold to the traditional order of things. They know, like VP Pence, that a woman’s place is at home, looking after the children and supporting their man.  And they know that while some people are destined for success and high office, there are some who just don’t have the character, the breeding and the background for it.  We upset this natural order at our peril.

Should/shouldn’t are quite relative. If one teacher prefers you to wear religious gear, and another teacher discourages it, should you wear it in the presence of the teacher who discourages it? I learned early we need to be flexible when I understood, for example, that Chogyal Namkhai Norbu strongly discouraged his students from offering prostrations to him, or wearing zens and so on.

Though I have all the requisites to be part of the white-robed, long-haired bunch, I prefer casual clothes and don’t wear any religious gear at all. Other people feel they need to wear it, and that’s fine with me. But I generally discourage it among my pupils.  If I am cold, I prefer a non-religious shawl or blanket around the shoulders. So these things are quite relative. I‘ve personally never met a teacher who insisted I wear some kind of gear. I doubt I would be that interested up in such a teacher. When I go to teachings I wear decent clothes, and do not dress like a hippy. The only difference between me and others is the length of my hair, which I have never cut in 16 years, though attrition through age means is it not as long as it was a decade ago.

(Commentary) Eleven things are tangible things: the four primary elements, softness, hardness, weight, lightness, cold, hunger and thirst.
I thought it worth pausing on this briefly as at first glance, it’s extremely counterintuitive.  You have elements, properties, and physical sensations bundled together into the same category. Why?

Malcolm wrote:
They are things experienced by the tactile organ, the body, and which must be touched or experienced physically. For example, though one can see the earth element, etc., as form, in order sense it’s weight, or other quality you must pick it up or feel it with your body organ. You cannot see the air element, but you can feel breezes, and so on. The sensations of the other three primary elements are self explanatory, fire feels hot, water feels wet.

As I said before, don’t get lost in the weeds of the debates. It will not contribute to your understanding of the basic subject. Save that for when you have understood the root text and the basic commentary. Things that are absent here are taken up later. It is helpful to understand that the topics in the Kosha are recursive. For example, the most detailed discussion of avijnapti occurs in the beginning of chapter four, Karma.
