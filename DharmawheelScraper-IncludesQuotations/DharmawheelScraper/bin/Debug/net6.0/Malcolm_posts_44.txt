Im curious about the meaning of "Dakinis living in the hair". What is this about, and why is hair specifically an important residence for Dakinis? Is it meant that quite literally Dakinis will somehow reside in your hair, or is it more metaphorical like "Dakini energy" will somehow reside in the practitioner and become focused in ones hair? Also what is Dakini energy? What would it be called in Sanskrit? Is it one of the forms of Shakti? Is it Kundalini? Not sure if these are questions that can be answered publicly or not.

Does seeing/touching/tasting the hair of a "true ngakpa" therefore contain some special blessing due to it carrying this special energy?

Malcolm wrote:
When one receives a hair empowerment, one's hair is theoretically blessed as a mandala, thus you are not to cut it, much as when one takes general empowerments, one must not harm the five aggregates since they are blessed as the mandala of male and female buddhas.

Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje gave me some of his hair from his brush, and told me that if I faced serious obstacles, I could burn it and they would be removed.

Bone lineage. What an interesting phrase & not one I'd heard before in this context. I would very much like to know if that is that a translation and/or one of the qualities from the father's line or lineage in Tibetan culture/language. Thank you.

Malcolm wrote:
The mother line is called the khrag rgyud, the "blood line." The father line is called rus brgyud, the "bone line."

This is based on the fact that the father's elements contributes to the formation of bone tissue, nerves and so on; while the mother's elements contributes to the development of flesh, muscle, blood and so on.

For example, since Terdag Lingpa never had a son, but only a daughter, the Mindroling paternal line ceased, and only the maternal line continued via his daughter.

Malcolm wrote:
In general in traditional Tibetan society, no one would dream of calling themselves a Ngakpa based on having received an empowerment, or even a hair empowerment.

Ngakpas are people who have shown some juice from their practice of mantra. When I see some practitioners who develop some real juice in their practice, then I will call them ngakpas. Until then, for me, they are just earnest practitioners with aspirations.

My teachers, Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje and Kunzang Dechen Lingpa (both "heart sons" of Dudjom Rinpoche who were with him in Tibet for many years) demonstrated the juice of their practice. The former did several years of retreat on Throma in remote caves in Kongpo, the latter did one week of Vajrakīlaya practice and achieved siddhi (the latter was recognized by Dudjom Rinpoche as the tulku of Terton Longsal Nyingpo).

Ordinations do not create Ngakpas, siddhis do. That is my main point here. Since I do not have siddhis, I don't call myself a Ngakpa, even though I have all the requisite empowerments and so on.

It really does not fit with the egalitarian model you have in your head, Greg, that "anyone" become a Ngakpa in the traditional Tibetan sense.

Things are neither pure nor impure, "pure and impure" are the dualistic concepts of sentient beings. Buddhas see shit, they just don't relate to it as impure or something to avoid, nor to they relate to gold as something pure to acquire.

Since this is case, if you insist that Buddhas in the human realm do not see water (or do not see pus and blood in a preta realm), I think you are deluded and you do not understand the meaning of conventional truth.

If on the other hand you opine that buddhas do not perceive phenomena such as shit and gold in terms of purity or impurity, then I can go along with this. But to believe that buddhas live in a comic book world of pure lands is naive beyond belief, and it means, as far as I am concerned, you have not understood the real import of the generation stage nor the completion stage.

And while it is true that anyone can take some vow and not cut their hair, that is not really what a ngakpa is. A real ngakpa is someone who actually has some realization, someone who has at least generated some heat through practicing Secret Mantra. It is for this reason I don't place very much importance on the so called "ngakpa ordination" or necessarily have a lot of respect for all these people who want to take "ngakpa vows" and go about in religious gear. For example, at base, to really be a candidate for wearing the white lower robe, you must be proficient in tummo, and so on. To really be a candidate for not cutting your hair, you must have the great compassion necessary that ḍākinīs will take up residence in it, etc. Ḍākinīs are not going to inhabit your hair just because you took a vow not to cut it.

also, when he gave as Simhamukha in Dudjom tersar, he said there is also everything for become a ngakpa.

im not wearing ngakpa robe all the time, of course. hovewer Rinpoche explained, that robe is something like armour for practicioner, cos when you are wearing a robe, you will not go to pub, and so on. i do wear a robe mainly on the retreats, or when im doing practice. also Dzongsar K.Rinpoche said in his book (Not for happiness, that it is good for us to wear smthing "special" for practice.

If you grasp at inherent existence, you're right. Beings appear as enlightened to pure minds and as suffering to impure minds, no contradiction. What something is depends upon how it is viewed.

Malcolm wrote:
This means that the Buddha's view of sentient beings as pure something relative, and not ultimate, in contradiction to your previous claim.

Tsongkhapafan said:
Ultimate doesn't mean absolute, it simply means that there is no contradiction between how something appears and how it exists. Buddhas see all phenomena as manifestations of bliss and emptiness and that's how they exist.

Malcolm wrote:
When you say ultimate, which Tibetan/Sanskrit term do you mean? Otherwise, it becomes confusing. When I say ultimate, I mean don dam, paramārtha.

Still, even if you maintain the above, the Buddhas perception of phenomena is still relative.

Malcolm wrote:
The origin of the custom of wearing white lower robes goes back to the fact that in ancient India, pious Buddhist lay people often wore all white cloths, indicating their status as upāsakas and upāsikās.

In Tibet, however, the garb of the so called "mantrins" became invested with much ritual significance, much of it coming from the tradition of Chō. And since there are so many traditions, it is not surprising that there have come to be much variance with respect the uniform of an upāsaka mantrin in Tibet. Exhibit A)




You can see here there is that most of these Repkong ngakpas wear an assortment of outfits. They are mainly recognizable through the distinctive coiled dreadlocks on their heads.

However, due to the important position of the Dudjom Tradition in the exile community and in West, the characteristic uniform of the mantrin students of Dudjom Rinpoche's followers has come to represent the standard uniform of upāsaka mantrins.

Obviously he also sees delusion, suffering, ignorance, etc, because otherwise he could not have ministered to us. He wouldn't have seen us as suffering at all if that were the case. I think that my explanation of the Buddha's ability to see "things-as-they-are" is what "Tsongkhapafan" meant though. The Buddha does not "see" ignorance/suffering/delusion in that he knows that "ignorance/suffering/delusion" is false. That being said, he can still recognize the falseness in order to rectify it.

Having a realization is not equivalent to liberation. There are many realizations one must have before one enters the path of seeing. Once one has entered the path of seeing however, one begins the process of liberation that culminates on full awakening, buddhahood, at the end of the tenth bhumi. The fullest account of this, in Mahāyāna is found in the Abhisamaya-alaṃkara.

The process of liberation means gradually abandoning the afflictions which cause rebirth in samsara. Full awakening means omniscience.

That was my understanding (and thanks for the lead on the Kongtrul text.  I haven't made it through the Treasury of Knowledge.)  With that said, and at the risk of being blunt:  what's the big deal?

Malcolm wrote:
Well, for one, I think the "big deal" came about because early Western observers of the exile Tibetan community in the 1970's saw that there was a community of practitioners [like my guru Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje and Kunzang Dechen Lingpa] surrounding Dudjom Rinpoche who dressed in a specific uniform consisting of a white skirt, a stripped Zen, their hair bound in a topknot [often around a metal cylinder containing tantras and tagdrols].

These westerners saw this as a alternate ordination path, based on the lore that in the first decades of the 9th century, King Ralpcan honored the tiny community of Tibetan lay Vajrayāna practitioners on the same level as the tiny community of monastics, and based on legend that when Langdarma "destroyed" the monastic community, Nub Sangye Yeshe intimidated him into leaving the community of practitioners of Secret Mantra alone (Nub Sangye Yeshe definitely lived in the latter part of the 9th century and the beginning of the tenth. Nevertheless, Nubchen is considered one of the 25 disciples of Padmasambhava. In order to explain the latter fact, it is held that he lived for possibly as long as 130 years. Not an impossible feat by any means).

It seems certain to me that Langdarma's "persecution" of the monasteries was in fact his demand for taxes from the monasteries which had previously operated free of taxation that when the Tibetan economy went into serious recession in the early 840's (due to trade disruption along the silk route due to the fall of the Uyghur empire in 840). It was this that led to his assassination by Lhalung Palgyi Dorje.

DGA said:
...what's at stake in this discussion, given that the communities in question here don't have a baked-in demand for averting-bad-fortune, bringing-good-fortune rituals?

Malcolm wrote:
On a purely social and economic level, as a culture Tibetans have proven themselves, since the '59 diaspora, remarkably effective in creating and cultivating clients, thus creating a demand for the services they provide. These services range from religious instruction to the kind of apotropaic rituals described above, and everything in between.

DGA said:
I attended a retreat a year or two ago at a large center in rural Colorado.  I volunteered for "karma yoga" duty, which put me in the kitchen washing dishes.  I did what I ordinarily do:  rolled up my sleeves, put an apron on, tied up my hair, and got to it.  No problem.  Someone else on KP duty at that time had evidently committed to the full ngakmo costume at all times, meaning that she struggled to scrub teacups one at a time while wearing a zentra and with her hair down.  Not too productive.  It was kind of sad.  One assumes that the role of a ngakpa/mo is not to make oneself useless, no?

Malcolm wrote:
There are all kinds of commitments one can undertake, but the idea that one is required, like monastics, to wear special "Ngakpa robes" at all times, is a complete misunderstanding. There are all kinds of Ngakpa styles, short haired, long haired, monastic, dread-locked, etc.

For many Tibetans, the term sngags pa really just means, "lay people with long hair who practice rituals, eat meat, drink booze, and chase girls." While among western Nyingmapas, Ngakpas are revered with near comical devotion, the situation among Tibetans is just not the same, just as Indians do not really think that sadhus are all that. Also, as you point out, there is no market for western Ngakpas, not really. Though there are some who go around and try to cultivate markets for their services, some more successful, some less, the fact is that the Ngakpa tradition as a whole serves a segment of the Tibetan population with rites that in some respect are not really proper for monks to engage in, such as divination, hail prevention, and so on. As you astutely point out, there is no baked in demand for Ngakpa services in the West. I just don't see Ngakpas replacing Evangelical Christian prayer circles for driving out demons and so on any time soon. Perhaps in Mexico on down to South America, the situation will be a little different.

Anyway, I keep my own Ngakpa gear tucked away nicely. Maybe some day I will see a reason to put it on, but frankly, I have not seen such a reason for some years.

No, when one has been introduced and recognized the basis, that is sufficient. For example, when one has been introduced to a person, the next time one sees them, one will recognize them. Of course, it is possible to forget their face after some time in a one time meeting, so once one has been introduced to a person, familiarization with that person, going to meet them again and so on, is recommended.

No one ever claimed that one was able to introduce oneself to the basis, or that having been introduced, there was nothing further to do. But what is stated is that there is nothing that needs to be transformed, changed or otherwise modified as a result of such an introduction. One needs only to familiarize oneself with the subject that was introduced. Indeed, in Dzogchen teachings, vidyā or rig pa is sometimes referred to as "the conditional basis," because vidyā or rig pa is conditional upon introduction and does not exist without it.

Of course, we don’t ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations, but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed. I also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record. At the same time, however, given that we don’t know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I don’t want to create a misleading impression.

Individual opinions on this are fine obviously, but if your definition is grounded in a teachers words or a sūtra, please guide me to the source of them.

It is also held there are two kinds of false perception;
that of nondefective sense organs and that of defective sense organs.
And Śantideva's definition form the Bodhicarya-avatāra clarifies it well:
Relative and ultimate 
are held to be the two truths.
The ultimate is not within range of the intellect;
the intellect is said to be relative.

Perfect buddhahood is attained there,

For example, previously one could not recognize gold. However one can recognize gold when instructed in how to recognize it, but that gold is not produced by the recognition. Likewise, previously one could not recognize dharmatā. However one can recognize dharmatā when instructed in how to recognize it, but that dharmatā is not produced by the recognition.

Unlike gold, however, dharmatā is not a conditioned or compounded entity. Dharmatā does not arise dependent on the introduction. Dharmatā, one's own nature, is present whether or not it is recognized, like the wish-fulfilling gem concealed under the lintel of a pauper's door.

Just as a gold bed pan or a gold Buddha statue are equally made of gold, when our own nature is not recognized, it is called "the basis." When it is recognized, it is called "the result," but it has itself undergone no transformation at all. For this reason then, the result is never conditioned because the basis is never conditioned. Nonrecognition of the basis is not a fault of the basis, it is a fault of the consciousness which apprehends the basis. When the basis is rightly apprehended, this is called vidyā, rig pa or knowledge. When the basis is incorrectly apprehended, this is called avidyā, ma rig pa, or ignorance.

They are called "first, second, and third" due to their content, not due to their temporal sequence.

Dudjom Rinpoche's presentation is based upon that Buton Rinchen Drup. But such presentation had already been long rejected by Loppon Sonam Tsemo for the reasons I outline above. Additionally, there are a host of contradictions which arise if the wheels were not turned simultaneously.

Or as the All-Creating King states:
The one who talks about relative and ultimate—
words of exaggeration and deprecation—
does not understand the meaning of nonduality.
And:
Since I, the creator of all, have made all Dharmas, 
there is no need for the two truths in my Dharma.

All that I have made, was made in the state of bodhicitta.
Relative and ultimate do not exist in bodhicitta.

We have unconsciously inherited this idea from the kind of Buddhist historiography we find in the West, in general.

While such ideas are not absent from traditional hermeneutics, the traditional approach to this in Tibet, for example, is predicated on the three vows, rather than historical analysis of the Pali Canon, the Agamas, and so on, because the traditional sense of Buddhist history does not proceed from the same set of assumptions Westerners use to approach Buddhist history (text critical, etc.). Astus' approach exemplifies the Western approach very well, in his assumption that the Nikāya/Agamas form a layer of teachings earlier than and prior to Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna, so that without the former, the latter could not have arisen.

Although if there is no common ground for the various groups, it also means that the paths they distinguish are different, and they actually do not say anything about the others, but rather simply make up their own structure of teachings. For example, the nine vehicles of the Nyingmapas say nothing about the teachings of the Kagyupas or the Theravadins, because those nine are merely their own interpretation of the teachings.

Malcolm wrote:
The nine yānas are also a taxonomy, a way of presenting distinct kinds of methodologies. Noone ever claimed they were a "core teaching." The Kagyus however, never dispute the nine yāna presentation, no matter how much it may have been disputed by first Sakyapas, and later, Gelugpas.

Well, no. There is a famous account in the sūtras concerning one of Buddha's past lives.  Long ago, there were two groups of śrāmaneras. One group was headed by a very strict leader, whose discipline and renunciation was impeccable as it was famous. The other group was headed by a very liberal leader, who encouraged his students to go into the towns in the evenings, and mingle with the townsfolk in bars and restaurants, associating with men and women alike.

When the leader of the first faction heard about this, he was immediately disapproving of the second faction and their leader and reproached him severely. The long and short of it is, the first leader spent time in lower realms, and when he took rebirth as Śakyamuni Buddha, his sangha fractured into sectarianism as a karmic residue resulting from his criticism of the more liberal monk and his sangha.

Malcolm wrote:
No, Mañjuśrimitra is stating very clearly that there is direct method of realization and an indirect method. Mipham comments here:

If it is asked, “What is the method for realizing the definitive meaning through the indirect method?,” since nonactivity is illustrated with the activity of fabricated efforts, like pointing at the moon with a finger, also awakened mind correctly grasped through a symbol will accomplish awakening because the Bhagavan Buddha, the teacher of devas and humans, has declared that it is “great awakening.” Any unfortunate one who conceptualizes entities should make efforts in the indirect method of realization. 

In that case, this which is to be explained is the basis or cause of the meditation that generates ultimate awakened mind itself. If it is asked what that is, it is samadhi and mudra. 

Now then, through the power of cultivating the three samadhis of suchness, universal illumination and the cause, [14/a] one will be stable, and not carried away by negative conditions. After the meditation of binding the three symbolic mudras of buddhahood— the body (mahāmudra), the mind (samaya mudra), and the activities (karmamudra)—generate the mind as the great dharmamudra (the symbol of speech). One should then meditate the recitation of the essence mantra.

If one meditates generating the thought that the samadhis and the mudras are dharmatā and therefore are not different, the ultimate awakened mind will arise. If one actualizes the meditation, one realizes that all phenomena do not exist apart from one’s mind. The accumulations are gathered and obscurations are purified because of that meditation. One becomes realized because one’s continuum is blessed by the deity of pristine consciousness

Since this is so, the fact that these criteria are only accepted by some Vajrayānis merely indicates that the skill to evaluate all paths is missing from schools other than Vajrayāna, and in particular, the Great Perfection.

Furthermore, the purpose of evaluating paths is due to the fact that everyone wishes to achieve liberation as rapidly as possible. Likewise, the purpose of evaluating gemstones is due to the fact that everyone wishes to know that they are buying the best quality gem possible.

Fair enough, but a promise of rapid liberation is not a guarantee of rapid liberation.

And, of course, one should rely on expert advice, but it always happens to be the case that the expert giving the advice happens to be a practitioner of the path/vehicle, regardless of the path/vehicle.  Proof of the pudding is in the eating, yes?

But what I like to do, is not judge a tradition by its adepts, because the adepts of any religion/tradition seem to display the same qualities, I like to judge by the qualities displayed by middling/average practitioners.  They tend to be the dead giveaways.

With respect to liberation, the criteria of liberation is freedom from afflictions. But this also cannot be evaluated from outside. However, liberation is just half the Buddhist path, there is also omniscience. Since this omniscience is primarily defined from knowledge of the paths of awakening, it is also difficult to ascertain from outside.

The arguments for the efficacy of Vajrayāna over Mahāyāna is based on being an easy path, with many methods, for those of sharp faculties, and so on.

The argument for the Great Perfection, the summum bonum of all vehicles, is based on the fact that it cannot be ascertained through words and explanations, but only on the basis of the intimate instructions of a guru, which are not (as is commonly misunderstood from the name "intimate instructions," "pith instructions," and so on) solely based on explanations, but are a means of introducing someone to their own state in the form of a direct sensory perception which bypasses conceptual constructs.

The point is not to proclaim, "My diamond is unflawed, yours is flawed," the point is to relieve sentient beings from anxiety about being forever trapped in samsara. This is why I reject your charge of triumphalism. If someone thinks that Dzogchen rhetoric is mere triumphalism, they have not understood the point of Dzogchen at all in the first place.

Criteria: rainbow body, all the signs along the path of Vajrayana etc
How are those criteria objective when they are accepted only by some Vajrayana followers?

Malcolm wrote:
Someone who is not expert in paths will not necessarily be able to distinguish a correct path from an incorrect path, or a superior path from an inferior path. Only some people have the necessary knowledge to make such an evaluation.

Likewise, someone who is not expert in gems will not necessarily be able to discern a real diamond from a fake diamond, a high quality diamond from a low quality diamond. Only some people have the necessary skills to make such an evaluation.

Since this is so, the fact that these criteria are only accepted by some Vajrayānis merely indicates that the skill to evaluate all paths is missing from schools other than Vajrayāna, and in particular, the Great Perfection.

Furthermore, the purpose of evaluating paths is due to the fact that everyone wishes to achieve liberation as rapidly as possible. Likewise, the purpose of evaluating gemstones is due to the fact that everyone wishes to know that they are buying the best quality gem possible.

Gyurme Kundrol said:
Ive been studying wrathful practices, their meaning and purpose, and came across the idea that the essence of wrathful practice is something like trekchod- an immediate and forceful cutting through of delusion and a return to the non-dual state. Is trekchod considered a wrathful practice and if you can do trekchod well is there even any need to get wrathful empowerments? Does a wrathful practice (such as Vajrakilaya) add anything that trekchod doesnt already include?

Also are there wrathful practices which can be done without empowerments and or if you have received certain empowerments like the Zhitro are there wrathful practices you can do even if you havent received a special empowerment for that particular deity?

Malcolm wrote:
Trekchö is not a wrathful practice, and it involves no effort. If one is using effort to "cut through" anything, one has not discovered trekchö.

As to your second question; while wrathful yidams like Kilaya are for dealing with secondary issues, they can also be used as means for discovering the meaning of trekchö. Mañjuśrīmitra writes:
Furthermore, since the teacher has declared that awakening can be correctly grasped with a symbol,
in that case, this is the basis of the meditation that generates awakened mind. 
After the three samadhis are stable and after binding the three symbolic mudras, 
generate the mind as the great dharmamudra and meditate the recitation of the essence [mantra].
People who, for whatever reason are not capable of directly approaching the meaning of the Great Perfection directly, can do so indirectly via the means of sadhana practice.

Finally, there are no wrathful practices that do not require empowerment, but having received more or less any Shitro empowerment, from that point onward one only needs the lung and the instructions in order to practice any sadhana.

Wayfarer said:
I am aware of several online training courses and resources for Buddhist teachings, such as Dharma Ocean, and FPMT, and DharmaNet. However I think a useful resource would be a structured home-study and practice program, with some teacher oversight.

In my case, I have a regular daily practice, and have attended retreats and lectures so am familiar with the Buddhist teachings and principles. But my own practice is a bit patchy and I think a curriculum of things to learn, and a regular schedule of activities, would really help to give it structure; I feel like I'm wasting a lot of time by being so irregular in my practice, but I'm not that good at self-management with nobody to oversee my activities.

For instance, in monastic and retreat centres, there is a regular schedule, and also a calendar, around which observances and practices are organised. A lightweight version of that approach would be really helpful. I wouldn't imagine it would need to go to nearly the same depth as the above-mentioned centres. But it could incorporate some liturgical materials, meditation practices, and things to commit to memory, and so on.

Is the community aware of any such resources out there?

there is no distinction between sharpness and dullness in capacities.
If one practices, even a cowherd will be liberated.
If one understands the significance of the luminosity of one’s mind through direct perception,

I'm interested in this more because this kind of thinking seems to be a symptom of something more immediate.
Other factors are at work in creating a conspiratorial mind. Uscinski and Parent note that in laboratory experiments “researchers have found that inducing anxiety or loss of control triggers respondents to see nonexistent patterns and evoke conspiratorial explanations” and that in the real world “there is evidence that disasters (e.g., earthquakes) and other high-stress situations (e.g., job uncertainty) prompt people to concoct, embrace, and repeat conspiracy theories.”

Other factors-
1. Group Identity
2. Education

There are many reasons we need broader participation in community and community decision making and I'd go farther and say, reorganization of the wealth distribution system. Happiness of our fellows, encouraging everyone to have a sense of agency, might be one of the most important.

The Indian tradition, what we possess of it, is also largely silent on the matter.

The Gelugpa are contrarians here in this respect, rejecting the Saṃdhinirmocana and the third turning as provisional since they locate this sūtra in the Yogacara school since it also mentions the ālayavijñāna.

And this is where you theory stumbles and falls.  The Buddha chose the colours, the hairdo and the garments so that Buddhist ascetics DID stand out from non-Buddhist lay-people and clergy.

Malcolm wrote:
No, in fact he did not. All he insisted was that early robes were to be made out of discarded shrouds and dyed any color one pleased so they would not be white.

The number of robes, three, were gradual add ons.

Having a shaved head was a common practice among many śrāmanera communities of the time.


Sherab Dorje said:
This served a number of purposes:  If an ascetic behaved in a wholesome manner then the meritorious behaviour was immediately associated with the practices of the BUDDHIST monastic community.  If an ascetic engaged in unwholesome behavior he was easily identifiable and thus ran the risk of expulsion.

In reality, especially early on, there was little to distinguish a Buddhist monk from some other kind of śrāmanera.

The two truths do not exist for Dzogchen. As the Soaring Garuda states:

Since phenomena and nonphenomena have always been merged and are inseparable,
there is no further need to explain an “ultimate phenomenon.”
And Mañjuśrīmitra explains that the two truths are the same:
Therefore, because awakening and nonawakening are the same in terms of absence of characteristics, there is nothing to accept or reject.
In accordance with that meaning, all those explanations 
of the nominal ultimate, the absence of arising and ceasing, sameness, 
nonduality, beyond thought, emptiness, the dharmadhātu, 
freedom from expression and convention, and so on are neither ultimate nor relative.

It also depends on the degree you get.

Many liberal arts degrees don't get you anything, except maybe some entry level job paying $25,000 a year. That's fine if you have parents paying your rent while you work for less than minimum wage and gain experience. If you're smart enough, you'll be able to translate that into something better in a few years. Or you go back to grad school after a while. Takes money to make money, they say.

If you don't have that luxury, don't have any particular genius, you probably should pursue a Bachelor of Science (instead of arts), and pick a field where there are demands. Engineering, nursing, for instance. Be willing to transfer where the jobs are when you graduate. You may not get to live someplace sexy like San Francisco or Brooklyn or Austin, but you'll be in a position to have a solid middle class life by taking that chemical engineering job in St. Louis.

The dirty secret they don't tell kids coming up the social ladder is that they don't have the luxury of reading literature for four years or studying art history unless their parents are in a position to support them through the first few years of their post-college lives so that they can take poorly paying or non-paying jobs that allow you the experience, exposure and connections you need to build one of those creative careers.

I know little about Dzogchen but I know there is a Bodhisattva vow that warns against disparaging lesser paths, namely Hinayana, because a Bodhisattva must understand and appreciate all the necessary means for any individual being to attain enlightenment.

Malcolm wrote:
You cannot understand all paths unless you understand the limitation of each path.

Dzogchen, being the essence of all paths, merely points out the limitations of other paths, i.e., the ways in which they obscure the meaning of buddhahood.

Malcolm wrote:
The notion of gradual vs. sudden is a self-imposed limitation. Dzogchen does not make a distinction between persons of sharper and duller capacity, for example, unlike lower paths. In Dzogchen, there is no notion that there are some people who cannot understand the meaning of Dzogchen.

There is only the notion that there are people who either have not had the fortune of meeting Dzogchen teachings or whose own conceptuality regarding cause and effect, and so on, prevent them from embracing Dzogchen teachings whole-heartedly.

Once a person decides to embrace Dzogchen teachings and is willing to dispense with the conceptual limitations about buddhahood imposed by the paths of cause and result, there is no obstacle placed in the way of people who wish to learn about Dzogchen teachings. Dzogchen teachings make no distinction between persons of sharper and duller capacity as I mentioned above. A proper teacher is all that one requires to follow Dzogchen teachings.

Any teacher who claims that Dzogchen requires one to be a person of high capacity, etc., frankly, does not know what they are talking about and should be immediately understood as a person of very limited understanding of Dzogchen teachings.

On the other hand, there are today teachers who use the name "Dzogchen" to defraud students into following them, who then never give actual teachings on Dzogchen, or who are given mistaken teachings on Dzogchen. So, caveat emptor.

Who can consider Vinaya reliable since it is embedded in ancient gender disparities between men and women? How are they even relevant today?

Even the way the vow against sexual misconduct is formulated (even where I agree with it) is a reflection of patriarchal economic values embedded in property relations and principally refers to male sexual conduct. The formulation of bhikṣuni vows is clearly oppressive towards women since they must follow an additional 111 extra vows, on top of the 253 vows prescribed for bhikṣus.

Thus, in the face of this kind of disparity, whether or not monks watch porn is pretty much a nonissue since Buddhist institutional monasticism systematically oppresses women.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course, this expectation created a situation where, in Tibet, the convention came to be telling lay people that they were not privileged to know what monks vows were, because if they did know, they might criticize monastics for breaches of their discipline and loose faith.

Just another patriarchal means of control...

Interestingly, after being rejected by the Tibetans proper in Tshang, the Dzogchen teachings were first spread and preserved on the Tibetan plateau in a matriarchal society, the country of rGyal mo tsha ba rong, literally, "The Hot Gorge of the Queens.

Gyurme Kundrol said:
The rGyalrong are one of the many ethnic and linguistic groups of western Sichuan.  Due to the extreme nature of the mountains and valleys where they live, they have been relatively isolated throughout much of their history, resulting in a wide variety of divergent dialects.  There is documentation of the rGyalrong as early as the Tang dynasty (AD 608-917) describing a legendary matriarchal society, ruled by a queen, protected by fortress-like watchtowers along a river of gold.  Ancient towers still stand, and the Dajin River (大金川, Big Gold River) flows through rGyalrong territory, historically rich in gold.

As far as the three vows go, this is an interesting literature, but none of it is decisive nor conclusive. Why? Because no one agrees on how they should be interpreted, for example, the controversy over whether the fifth samaya merely refers to abandoning Mahāyāna bodhicitta, or the release of semen. Tibetan scholars spend lifetimes obsessing about issues which are of no fundamental importance.

However, if we get the essence of the three vows, rather than being distracted by their particulars, the essence of the Hinayāna vows is not harming others. Therefore, the evaluation of pornography from this point of view should be "Does my action of indulging in erotica or pornography harm others?"

The essence of Mahāyāna vows is helping sentient beings. Therefore, the evaluation of pornography should be, "Does my action of indulging in erotica or pornography cause me to objectify women (and men)— treating them as objects of personal gratification— and cause me to  lose sight of them as persons deserving of my compassion?"

The essence of general Secret Mantra vows is pure vision. Therefore, the evaluation of pornography from this point of view should be "Does my action of indulging in erotica or pornography lead me into engage in impure vision?"

We won't get into Dzogchen, since in Dzogchen, there is nothing to abandon or adopt, but only something to recognize.

I think you have too specific a definition of "middle", conditioned by your own perspective. It seems like you are using middle as an absolute point, with Marxism on the left and crony capitalism with reactionary social views to the right.

I personally would just call middle and mainstream whatever is in mainstream political discourse. The Overton window.

What is "middle" today in America was not "middle" 100 years ago, nor middle in Roman times. I'd argue for example that socialist parties posed a far greater threat to capitalism in the pre-WW2 period than they do today. So "Leftism" then was a much more effective opponent of the "Right" than it is today. But both "Left" and "Right" are meaningless if you extend the timeline over a longer period.

There are plenty of things that are not mainstream and not necessarily alt-right, for example, what I discussed in the OP, that progress and growth will face limits, we cannot expect perpetual economic growth. Even Green parties don't discuss this.

maybay said:
Nobody asked her to comply -  not in either of the translations I'm looking at. And just for everyone else who reads this Dowman has that she went to her new husband "without demur", i.e. without protest and the usual nonsense. "In her new home she performed everything that was expected of her cheerfully and uncomplainingly, always speaking modestly and sweetly, thus controlling both her body and speech."

Malcolm wrote:
In the Tibetan, "After her husband came and took her to his house...." the verb is khyer ba which means "to be carried away" The verb is commonly used to describe what happens to one when caught in a flood. This term indicates that she did not go willingly, especially in light of the protest against her parents.

Dowman's translation above is excessively interpretive— the words "new home," "demur, "cheerful," "uncomplaining," and "expected" exist nowhere in the Tibetan text and are not implied at all.


maybay said:
If we are going to characterize this story, I think Manibhadra the Domestic Drudge is a more apt analogy than "Happy Housewife."
Well that's just your opinion man. The story goes she was from wealthy family. Drudgery seems unlikely. It it weren't for Kukkuripa she wouldn't have considered liberation.

Malcolm wrote:
You miss another essential point in the story— that she sat for a whole day looking at the broken pot on the ground. Why do you think so?

Considering that she had already been beaten and abused verbally by her parents for running off to follow Kukkuripa to begin with, and was "carried off" or "taken" by her husband after having remain on her own for a year following that, the entire story suggests that she was in a situation of involuntary, domestic servitude (the condition of billions of women and girls in the world today) through an arranged marriage over which she had no control— which is what makes her doha at the end more poignant.
Now I shall go to great bliss without returning 
to the house of samsara.
In this case, the "happy" housewife is equating her home with samsara. Some happy housewife.


maybay said:
I don't know why you seem so desperate to deny this possibility.

Malcolm wrote:
This issue is not housewives in general and the obvious fact that many women today find this a fulfilling, satisfying life. The issue is Manibhadra specifically, and her obvious unhappiness with her state of domestic servitude, her youthful rebellion and her eventual emancipation more than a decade after meeting her guru.

Indeed, this tale is edifying example for women inso far as Manibhadra shakes free of the shackles of mundane, patriarchal domesticity and realizes her own power as an independent women. Recall that in general the tales of the 84 Mahāsiddhas virtually always contain some element of transgression of conventional norms. A common women shaking free of her domestic role and abandoning her husband and young children would have been nothing short of totally shocking and transgressive to Indians in the 11th century.

My critique is not directed at liberated men and women, but rather the patriarchal values that overlook, demean, and obscure women (with rare exceptions like the four female Mahāsiddhas, the Therigatha and so on) through the near total silence of women's voices and the obvious male fetishization of women found in Buddhist literature in general, and particularly in the Niruttarayogatantras.

Malcolm wrote:
The point of the story is that she is unhappy with family life, and when she breaks the pot she says:
To what home will
beginningless sentient beings go
when the clay vessel of their bodies is broken?
My clay vessel has long been broken, 
Now I shall go to great bliss without returning 
to the house of samsara.
E ma! Those who wish to attain bliss
should rely on the amazing guru!
You also seem to lack the understanding that she rebelled against her parents after receiving the Cakrasamvara empowerment and instructions from Kukkurpa:
The guru saw that the girl's continuum was ripe, and bestowed upon her the empowerment of Cakrasamvara. After she was given the instruction for unifying creation and completion, she practiced in that retreat place for a week. Then she retuned to her parents. 

Since they beat and derided her, the girl said, "If the three realms are pure, are you not my parents? Though your family and lineage are important, you do not turn away from samsara. I have been struck by the accomplishment of liberation based on my guru! I shall follow the path," and left them speechless. 

She then cultivated her guru's instructions and having giving up all activities, she remained for one year. After her husband came and took her to his house, she did all the mundane work and activities, she agreed to comply in body and speech, and spoke pleasantly, and so on.
She continued in this way for 12 years, had a couple of kids, etc., then she has the incident with the pot. So I think that your characterization (while understandable given the way it is presented in the translation you are using) is thoroughly inaccurate.

If we are going to characterize this story, I think Manibhadra the Domestic Drudge is a more apt analogy than "Happy Housewife."

you know some Mahasiddhas had prostitute consorts or some were prostitutes themselves? and they are described as dakinis taking form of prostitute. Can you just for a second imagine that porn start can be dakini too or daka for that matter?

Malcolm wrote:
The reason that Darikpa, a prince, was ordered by his teacher Luipa to serve a courtesan (not really the same as a prostitute, and did not necessarily involve sex work) was to cut his pride.

This brings up another issue: the extent to which, in the West in particular, Vajrayāna tropes such as "Mahasiddhas had prostitute consorts or some were prostitutes themselves" serve male fantasies since women's voices in these scenarios are entirely absent, apart from narratives entirely written by men which generally portray women as treacherous and dangerous to the project of yoga, as in the tale of Ghantapāda:

Karinos said:
There was a wicked whore in Pataliputra who told Devapala that she would be able to corrupt Ghantapa and ruin him. This vile woman had a virtuous and unspoiled virgin daughter who was commanded to seduce the yogin. As Ghantapa would meditate the young girl would bow and circumambulate him, begging for the opportunity to serve him and be his patron. He resisted but the girl was persistent. Ghantapa eventually moved to a small hut for the monsoon season and although the maiden followed him; he requested that his food only be brought by male servants.

For two weeks, only men tended to the yogin but on the fifteenth day the young woman told them to stay back and she went herself. When Ghantapa asked her to leave she complained that there were rain clouds in the sky and that she should wait until they pass. Once the clouds had passed it was getting dark and she cried saying that if she were to leave at night bandits would kill her. He told her that she had to sleep outside but as it got colder during the night she moved into the hut. Saying she was cold, she got closer and closer until eventually their bodies touched and thus the two came together in tantric union.

Malcolm wrote:
http://www.himalayanart.org/search/set.cfm?setID=332

Here, we have a "wicked whore" (how do we know she was wicked? What is her story?) who has a "virtuous and unspoiled virgin daughter," (at this point, we really are in a patriarchal Catholic universe where the virginity of women has "moral," and thus economic value). We have the celibate yogin, who resists this delectable young women, until, out of his kindness, he lets her stay the night because he fears for her safety. "Naturally," he is unable to resist her charms, but manages in the story to foil the plot of the "vile woman" to subvert him with the erotic power of her "virtuous and unspoiled virgin daughter." And of course, story portrays Ghantapāda as a sexual naif who takes no responsibility for his own arousal, shifting it onto the dangerous Other.

Certainly, as I note above, the manuals for selecting female consorts differ very little from the descriptions of different kinds of women found in erotic manuals like the Kama Sūtra. But what are notably absent in such manuals are the graphic descriptions of men appropriate for each of these kinds of women, described as padminis, conches, and so on based on descriptions of women's breasts, vaginas, teeth, lips, eyes, and vaginas. At least the Kama Sūtra contains descriptions of types of men, their body types, the size of their penises and the kind of women for which those penises are best suited. Corresponding descriptions of male phenotypes and their genitalia are conspicuously absent from manuals which describe such women. Present however is the strong recommendation to inflame passion through the standard Indian tropes of kissing, pinching, biting, and so on, as well as "erotic conversation (aka "talk dirty to me")" and use of visual erotica as preliminaries for karmamudra practice.  Monks and single men, of course, who wished to engage in these practice, needed to use a different kind of "consort," i.e. their hands, while visualizing an imagined consort and imagining these behaviors (you may think I am kidding, but I am not.)

Indeed, we really have to understand these stories as patriarchal accounts which obscure womens' stories, which render them as dangerous, which fundamentally serve male fantasies through the way patriarchal society fetishizes women (virginity vs. prostitution; celibacy vs. being sexual active; treacherous women vs. honorable men and so on).

For one thing, Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen and the Sakya school in general complete rejects this interpretation. The fifth samaya is simply an indication that one should abandon not relative and ultimate bodhicitta. The idea that it includes semen is also a problem, since the word in Tibetan is khu ba, and depending on context, it wither refers merely to the reproductive seed, or the precursor substances which is divided into reproductive seed and ojas (mdangs). ChNN, in his Birth, Life and Death, states unequivocally, that the reproductive seed is a complete waste product of the body and should be released. According to him, attempts to conserve can lead to sexual dysfunction, stones, and so on. His point of view is supported in various Ayurveda and Tibetan medicine, as well as cycles such as the Khandro Nyinthig.

Gyurme Kundrol said:
When the subject of sex comes up it seems most practitioners lose their common sense.

Instead of engaging in the categorization and definition of pornography as better or worse, good or bad, pure or vile, we should be engaging in pure view generally. Instead of judging a monk for masturbation we should judge ourselves for not having pure view towards our Vajra brothers and sisters. Instead of thinking some sex and some porn is fine but others is not we should seek to view all phenomena as the innately pure and empty display of the energies of our awareness. Instead of engaging in mental gymnastics to rationalize our attachment to sex we should remember the four noble truths and the fact that even small attachments will lead to small suffering, so needless to say great attachment will lead to great suffering.

Attachment leading to suffering doesnt stop just because we are attached to something we like a lot. In fact it only makes things worse. Even a house holder can overcome sexual desire while fulfilling martial duties.

Vajrayana and Tantra in general gives us the tools to deal with all these things. Sexual desire can be overcome, and saying "Im a householder" or "society is full of sex" or "this is the degenerate age" is just making excuses. You are either serious about liberation or you are not. You either want freedom or you do not. If you are serious then you will work with these energies and seek to no longer let them be your master and delude you. If not... then you will allow certain attachments to flourish and as a result will keep suffering in a state of delusion and probably stay in Samsara at least for a little while longer.

Ultimately if you are not willing to give up sexual desire you should never take Vajrayana vows. Refuge and Bodhisattva vows are fine, but Tantric vows require you to seek mastery over these energies and attachments and failure to do this is breaking your Samaya and you will suffer as a result of that.
"The fifth (root downfall) is, with a desirous mind and at an inappropriate time, intentionally emitting semen, thus forsaking the bodhicitta generated for sentient beings. The appropriate times to allow seminal fluid to leave the body are during the secret empowerment as an offering to the deities, when increasing the family line of ancestral heritage, and when making special pills or other medicines. Otherwise and especially out of desire, to ignore the words of honor and training and emit semen for ones own personal satisfaction outside the context of higher anuyoga practice constitutes the downfall. This also includes the abandonment of bodhicitta for any sentient being, because bodhicitta and the essential fluid are seen as one on the level of generation stage practice (of inner tantra). If aspirational bodhicitta is abandoned, practical bodhicitta is automatically forsaken.

-Perfect Conduct, Ascertaining the Three Vows - Commentary by Dudjom Rinpoche"
Overall its pretty straightfoward. Anyone holding Vajrayana vows should not engage these activities. Those who do not, can do as they like but the Buddha is clear that attachment leads to suffering. From an ultimate perspective its made clear all phenomena are primordially pure displays of luminous emptiness. So we should practice at the highest level we are capable of and should seek to stay committed to our vows. These vows we take also include pure view towards our Vajra brothers and sisters, which means not judging their conduct even if it is wrong and even if it occurs in a space we consider sacred.

There are also ways to go about calling someone out for breaking their Samaya and so forth, I dont recall where I read about it though and it has to be approached in a certain way. Certainly a mind of compassion is required since judging and pointing fingers and making lots of "you" statements wont do any good. Looking down on those who we share lineage with doesnt help us at all. And until our own minds are free from defilement we really shouldnt even attempt to correct others but should just keep working on ourselves.

None whatsoever. In fact, I knew people who worked in that club, and sometimes we would go there to have a drink. But strip clubs always made me uncomfortable for the simple reason that the women who work in them in general despise the clientele. This is what caused me to cease frequenting such places.

kirtu said:
Really?  It's small minded gossip to keep ones vows at a monastery during a retreat?  And these were full-time renunciates.

I agree that there are more important things in order to directly reduce short term suffering though and Malcolm highlights two of them.  Unfortunately the US and Russia and other nations spread their poison of weapons throughout the world.  People have been advocating that weapons sales from the West stop for many decades.  This has fallen on deaf ears.  Even after German tracked vehicles sold to Turkey were used to torture and kill PKK members (terrorists to the Turkish government and majority Turks), even after this hit front page newspapers decades ago, weapons were still sold.

Even now the US fails to lead on climate change forcing some of the rest of the world to initiate necessary but much too belated changes wrt energy production and efficiency and the transformation necessary to reign in mindless farming.  Still no one has significantly raised other pressing environmental issues at a high enough level.

Powerful people will always fail to lead on pressing issues until it is too late.  Wars will consume mankind.  People who are supposed to be representatives of Shakyamuni Buddha should at least keep their vows purely it shouldn't take a ngakpa, even a highly revered one, to remind them of that.

I am not sure where this appears outside of the Tibetan Vinaya Ksudraka, but in Buton's History of Indian and Tibetan Buddhism he relates how Mahakasyapa knew that when Ajatasatru heared of the Buddha's death he would surely die unless he was placed into first seven troughs of fresh butter and then a trough of sandal wood. This happens, the Bramin Varsaka acts as Kasyapa instructed him to, and the king indeed recovers.

I thought this was very strange. Does anyone have any insight into what is going on here? Perhaps a commentary in Tibetan says something. Obermiller cites Vinayaksudraka Kg. HDUL. XI. 290-1.

Is there a philosophy to counter?

Queequeg said:
Fwiw.

Wikipedia:
Objectivism is a philosophical system developed by Russian American writer Ayn Rand (1905–1982). Rand first expressed Objectivism in her fiction, most notably The Fountainhead (1943) and Atlas Shrugged (1957), and later in nonfiction essays and books. Leonard Peikoff, a professional philosopher and Rand's designated intellectual heir, later gave it a more formal structure. Peikoff characterizes Objectivism as a "closed system" that is not subject to change.

Objectivism's central tenets are that reality exists independently of consciousness, that human beings have direct contact with reality through sense perception, that one can attain objective knowledge from perception through the process of concept formation and inductive logic, that the proper moral purpose of one's life is the pursuit of one's own happiness (rational self-interest), that the only social system consistent with this morality is one that displays full respect for individual rights embodied in laissez-faire capitalism, and that the role of art in human life is to transform humans' metaphysical ideas by selective reproduction of reality into a physical form—a work of art—that one can comprehend and to which one can respond emotionally.

Academic philosophers have mostly ignored or rejected Rand's philosophy. Nonetheless, Objectivism has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives. The Objectivist movement, which Rand founded, attempts to spread her ideas to the public and in academic settings.

However, when I typed in the correct Tibetan into an on-line Tib-Eng dictionary yesterday, I also got "musk." So lu-tsi may be a synonym for la-tsi (unless the dictionary is wrong, which also could be). In this case, one needed to know that the lu tsi in the text was not a compound term, but that lu (klu) was an adjective (or possessive).

Infuriating that people wear the fact that they have slogged through Atlas Shrugged like a badge of honor. Like they had finished Moby Dick or Ulysses. I wonder if they realize the brain damage they caused themselves. When they praise Ayn Rand I am convinced of the dementia.

OK, I think I have the revised translation. On page 18 of the Saraswati Bhawan on-line version, where it says "Musk...", I believe it should read:

Naga plants and healing medicinals, such as
Suitable flat [leaves] and sprouts,

The problem is that one of the translators simply typed into their on-line Tib-Eng dictionary klu rtsi and got the word "musk." Since this person was not conversant with Naga puja and lore, this did not raise a red flag. Since I trusted the translator, I also did not notice this (even though I should have).

However, now I'm wondering if the next line, reading "The patterns of colors of a peacock [feather]," is correct. This does not really fit as a type of healing plant. Perhaps rma bya'i mdongs is the proper Tibetan name of a medicinal herb. Malcolm?

Unknown said:
So today I’m performing a public service on behalf of all the voters. I went back and re-read all the criticisms and attacks and best-selling “exposés” leveled at Hillary Rodham Clinton over the past quarter-century. And I’ve compiled a list of all her High Crimes and Misdemeanors.

Here they are:

1. When she was first lady, she murdered White House lawyer Vince Foster and then dumped his body in a park.

2. She drove Vince Foster to commit suicide through her temper tantrums.

3. She was having an affair with Vince Foster.

4. She’s a lesbian.

5. Chelsea isn’t Bill Clinton’s child.

6. She murdered Vince Foster to cover up that she once bought a tract of undeveloped land in Arkansas and lost money.

7. She murdered Vince Foster to cover up her role in firing the White House travel department.

8. After she murdered Vince Foster, she ransacked his office in the middle of the night and stole all the documents proving her guilt.

9. When Bill Clinton was governor of Arkansas, she was a partner in the state’s top law firm, and it sometimes did work involving the state government.

10. She once invested in commodities futures on the advice of a friend and made $100,000, proving she’s a crook.

11. She once invested in real estate on the advice of another friend and lost $100,000, also proving she’s a crook.

12. Unnamed and unverifiable sources have told Peggy Noonan things about the Clintons that are simply too terrible to repeat.

13. The personnel murdered at Benghazi make her the first secretary of state to lose overseas personnel to terrorism — apart from Condi Rice, Colin Powell, Madeleine Albright, George Schultz, Dean Rusk and some others.

14. Four State Department staff were murdered at Benghazi, compared with only 119 others murdered overseas under every secretary of state combined since World War II.

15. She illegally sent classified emails from her personal server, except that apparently they weren’t classified at the time.

16. She may have cynically wriggled around the email law by “technically” complying with it.

17. She once signed a lucrative book contract when she was a private citizen.

18. Donald Trump says she “should be in jail,” and he’s a serial bankrupt casino developer in Atlantic City, so he should know.

19. Former House Majority Leader Tom Delay says his “law-enforcement sources” tell him she is “about to be indicted” — and if a man once convicted of money laundering and conspiracy doesn’t have good law-enforcement sources, who does?

20. She’s a hard-left radical who wants to break up the nuclear family.

21. She’s a conservative “mousewife” who refused to break up her own family.

22. She’s in favor of single moms.

23. She refused to be a single mom.

24. When she was first lady of Arkansas, she pandered to conservative voters by dyeing her hair.

25. Before that, she totally insulted them by refusing to.

26. She’s a frump.

27. She spends too much money on designer dresses.

28. She has “cankles.”

29. She has a grating voice.

30. She yells into the microphone.

31. She spent 18 years in Arkansas and some of the people she knew turned out to be crazy rednecks and crooks.

32. She’s in the pay of the mafia.

33. She’s in the pay of the Chinese government.

34. She’s in the pay of the Wall Street banks.

35. In order to suppress the billing records from her time at the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, she cleverly packed them up and took them to the White House rather than shredding them.

36. When she handed over the documents to public officials, they couldn’t find any evidence she’d committed any crimes, so she must have doctored them.

37. Congress spent tens of millions of dollars and six years investigating her investment in the Whitewater real-estate project, and, while they didn’t actually find anything, they wouldn’t have spent all that money if there weren’t something there.

38. By cleverly hiding all evidence of her crimes in the Whitewater affair, she caused Congress to waste all that taxpayers’ money.

39. When she ran for senator of New York, she was still a fan of the Chicago Cubs.

40. She once said the Clintons were thinking of adopting a child, and they didn’t follow through.

41. She was photographed holding her hand near her mouth during the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.

42. She’s got brain damage.

43. She’s old.

44. She’s really ambitious and calculating, unlike all the other people running for president.

45. She secretly supported Palestinian terrorists, Puerto Rican terrorists and Guatemalan terrorists.

46. She secretly supported a group that wants to give Maine back to the Indians.

47. She’s a secret follower of “radical prophet” Saul Alinsky.

48. She did her law degree at Yale, and it’s a well-known “socialist finishing school.”

49. When she was young, she did things to build up her résumé rather than just for their own good.

50. When Bill was president, she “allowed” him to keep people waiting.

51. She’s married to a sex addict.

52. She’s an enemy of traditional marriage.

53. She didn’t divorce her husband.

54. His philandering is her fault because she is too strong, and too weak, and too frumpy, and too fat, and too cold.

55. She’s hostile to women who fool around with her husband.

56. A divorced taxi driver in Florida told me that if Hillary is elected president, “women will take over everything.”

57. She insulted Tammy Wynette.

58. When they left the White House, she and Bill bought a big house in New York that they couldn’t afford.

59. She sometimes calls her staff during dinner, even when they’re out at a restaurant.

60. She claimed there was a “vast right-wing conspiracy” against her husband, and it turned out there was nothing but a bunch of tycoons financing private investigators, and some fake think tanks and books and news sites and stuff.

61. When she got married, she didn’t “stay at home and bake cookies.”

62. She supported the Iraq war because she’s a secret foreign-policy conservative.

63. She’s a secret foreign-policy radical with a plan to impose worldwide “radical social experimentation” through the World Bank.

64. She is secretly plotting to let children sue their parents for making them take out the garbage.

65. She looked bored during the Benghazi hearings.

66. Oh, yeah — and she totally has a vagina.

It’s clear: Hillary must be stopped. Hearings now!

In my opinion, it is mostly concerned with silly arguments such as:

tomamundsen said:
The reason now that we place such importance on the outer appearance is a question of bodhicitta rather than of essential necessity. If Buddhism, let alone Vajrayana Buddhism, is to survive in the West - there must be an alternative to the monastic style. Buddhism will never be established even as a minor religion in Western countries as long as there are no clergy apart from monastics. This is why we have to be so scrupulous about our costume and the precise details of the vows involved. This is why we have to insist on uncut hair. Any deviation from the historical model undermines our position completely.

Malcolm wrote:
This sentiment is complete bollocks. There is no set, official Nakpa outfit or hair style. Ngakpas dress a hundred different ways, corresponding with the needs of sentient beings. They can wear three robes, or Gucci suits.

What is important is practicing Dzogchen, not being concerned with one's hair style, clothing, or other relative, secondary accouterments.

Further:

tomamundsen said:
We simply advocate the gö-kar-chang-lo as a way of integrating with life in the West - a way of making working family life a method of practice that can inspire others.

Malcolm wrote:
It is unnecessary, and in fact bizarre, to insist that copying Tibetan clothes is necessary for making family life a method of practice in the West.


tomamundsen said:
until the 11th Century, but thereafter the gö-kar-chang-lo'i-dé began to diminish and female practitioners in particular were forced into the background.

Malcolm wrote:
This is an unsubstantiated (male) fantasy. There is no evidence to support this. One, there is no evidence to support the idea that Ngakpas went into decline following the 11th century. Second, women, when they appear in ancient literature at all, generally appear only as the mothers and wives of important men. I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of female authors in Tibetan Buddhism before the 20th Century, all of them Nyingma.

tomamundsen said:
This was the time when they began to live in remote villages in order to continue their practises. They would live anywhere sufficiently far from the large monastic institutions. It would seem that the disparaging term 'village ngakpa' came from that period, as a way of diminishing respect given to the ngakphang sangha in places where the monasteries had less influence.

Malcolm wrote:
This piece of sociological speculation is also completely unsubstantiated and is not born out by even a superficial observation of Tibetan society. Ngakpa Dratsangs alway operated within close proximity to large Monastic establishments. The exception to this would be Tibetan Lamas who fled local wars with their families and followers and relocated to hidden lands. When established, they would automatically set about reestablishing Monastic Buddhism, monks and all. Oddly enough, the harshest criticism of so-called village Ngakpas (grong sngags pa) are in predictions of Padmasambhava.

I could go on, but what's the point?

On the ultimate level, is what we'd call a process -- a glass dropping and shattering on the floor, a seed sprouting and growing into a tree and getting old and dying, a human life from conception to death -- truly a process (a sequence of events/moments linked over time by causality) or is "process" just a figment of the mind's imagination?

Isn't that basically what Nagarjuna said (except for the brahman part) in the Mulamadhyamakakarika?

Malcolm wrote:
No, Nāgārjuna states that dependent origination and emptiness are basically the same thing:

That which originates in dependence is explained as emptiness,
that is a dependent designation, that itself is the middle way.
And:
Whoever rejects the emptiness of dependent origination
is one who rejects all mundane conventions.

And:
Whoever sees dependent origination sees suffering,
the source of suffering, the cessation of suffering, and the path.
One of the Buddhist criticisms of Advaita is that their presentation of the relative, conventional level is faulty, and therefore, their presentation of the ultimate is consequently faulty.

In all direct perception the knowledge is extremely clear but its scope is very limited. What we can directly see not only constitutes an extremely small iota of the wide spectrum of things existing in this universe, but many a times that which is directly cognized is far from truth.

If brahman has no attributes, therefore is undetectable, how can it be known that it is real?

In my understanding, Advaita's answers to this are:

1. You keep Neti Neti! -ing (rationally denying the ultimate truth of things/appearances) until the Truth (brahman) is all that remains.

2. You trust the word of the Hindu/Advaitan sages who have come to know the Truth with utter certainty.

Hi there. I am a theravada (hinayana) buddhist and i practice theravada (hinayana) meditations but sometimes i do meditation on Mahakala and Vajrasattva. I don't see that my life became better. I will detail it. Mahakala should defend me, he should remove the big hindrances and problems from my life. I don't experience it. Vajrasattva should clean my bad karmas, so i should experience less bad karmas in my present life. I don't experience it. WHY? The only interesting thing was i saw a blue buddha with blue lights around his body. I never saw such buddha before. Then i did a search on the internet with these words "blue buddha" and i saw  the buddha on google, it was very similar like which i saw. Interesting. Another buddha i saw after a meditation was a buddha which sit on lotus and the lotus was on clouds. I saw it for only some second so i didn't really saw the buddha. But i saw the clouds. I did a search on google and sure i saw buddhas who sit on lotus and the lotus was on clouds.... Again, an interesting thing.
My life.... is not better than before. What more, my life is worse now. I lost my job, i got a new job, which is harder than my previous job. My mental illness doesn't change, i spent some days at the psychiatry some months ago. (I have serious schizophrenia and anxiety). Working is very hard to me - though i work only 4 hours daily because i get a money support. My mind is very tired often. I get injection once in a month for cure schizophrenia.
If there are buddhas around me - then why they do not help? Where are they when i am in stress? Why my life doesn't turn into better?

So I guess if you are white, Christian and conservative things have gotten a little worse because of decades of Republican failed policies. Other than those whiny people, things are not great but they have improved somewhat since there has been no Republican in the white house for the past 8 years. My only regret is that the DNC corruptly denied Bernie the nomination. But I am still voting against Trump. As I said, we will deal with Clinton later.

The element of air is one of the four mahābhūtas, and therefore, a body made from the element of air is indeed part of the rupāskandha and is capable of perceiving physical sense objects, which are also part of the rūpaskandha. It is indeed a subtle body, since it is predominantly made of air, but each of the four elements contains the other three elements.

The question that has been bugging me for a while is how such a set of aggregates is held together after the parting of the mind and body. If the sense-fields of the physical body no longer constitute part of the conciousness aggregate, then what is it that keeps the mental body or experience self-contained and personal to that mental continuum? If it's Vayu without the shell of the physical body to be enclosed by, how does it not dissipate into space? Is it like an apparitional self-projected hologram that either recognizes or fails to recognize it's display as baseless?

I need to get to Bardo 101 class.

The so-called mental body in the bardo is in fact made of the matter of the element of air, as Greg mentioned above. It has complete sense organs and so on, because consciousness and vāyu are inseparable.

It seems that not all of the links "operate" in between.

It would seem that only the first three links operate in between - ignorance, mental formations, consciousness. Name-and-form would already be birth.

Is that correct?

Trump and his campaign have mentioned these right-wing extremists as potential appointees: Rudy Giuliani, Joe Arpaio, Sarah Palin, Ben Carson, Chris Christie and Forrest Lucas, oil executive and animal rights opponent for Department of Interior. Perhaps scariest of all, Myron Ebell, a leading climate-change denier, is expected to head Trump’s EPA. Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov.

Maybe it has something to do with this: The four syllables ( yi-ge bzhi ) tradition, found widely among the various Kagyu lineages, derives from Maitripa, who together with Naropa were the main Indian spiritual teachers of Marpa. It explains mahamudra in terms of the hidden meaning of the four syllables of the Sanskrit word amanasi ( yid-la ma-byed-pa ), which means “not taking to mind” or “not paying attention (incorrectly).” The four syllables connote:
1. cutting down to the foundational root state of the conventional mind,
2. gaining certainty with the methods for quieting and settling the mind in concentration,
3. severing the mind’s connection with points where it can deviate into conceptual cognition of true existence and into destructive states,
4. transforming the mind into the nature of pathways of deep awareness.

Big thanks to everyone who participated in this thread! Here's the main thing I learned from it:

If you pluck a teaching from the body of dharma teachings without understanding its context (Buddhist school, lineage, time period, etc.) no matter how much this teaching resonates with you (as Tilopa does with me) you run the risk of misunderstanding the context therefore missing the exact message the teacher intended to communicate, all of which could hamper your personal progress to realization.

It's a good lesson for me to learn. But, just so you know, my take on realization is perhaps a bit different from the conventional Buddhist take. (I am not a Buddhist, but deeply appreciate some Buddhist teachings.) I think realization is our birthright ... built into the package of being human. And I think "the other shore" is the same other shore regardless of what method one ends up taking to get there: swimming, snorkeling, rafting, surfing, flying, perhaps even walking on water ... I see Tilopa's advices as instructions for building and navigating a certain kind of raft. If I misinterpret them (in terms of his intended meaning), then I end up with a different raft. But different doesn't mean useless ... or perhaps not even inferior. It's just ... different, Tilopa's intended meaning filtered through me. So I don't mind the potential misunderstanding so much, in fact I kind of welcome it, I feel it gives me room to be creative with applying the teaching to my path.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, there is always Dombhi Heruka's Four Syllables:

Namo Guruve. 
The Intimate Instruction of the Great Bliss of Dharma
There are three essences, four commitments, three deviations and four methods of resting.
The three essences: Effortlessness
Without contrivance
Everything that occurs is understood as one's own mind.
The four commitments: Afflictions are not abandoned because they are one's mind. 
Antidotes are not relied upon because the mind is non-dual. 
The true nature is not meditated upon because mind is without grasping.
A result is not hoped for, realizing the mind itself is Buddhahood.
The three deviations: If there is hope for Buddhahood, it is a deviation.
If there is fear towards Samsara, it is a deviation.
If there is attachment to appearances, it is a deviation.
The four methods of resting: Just like the limpid quality of water when it is undisturbed, rest relaxed in uncontrived mind.
Just as a bird in the sky leaves no tracks, consciousness rests without support.
Just like the sun not concealed by clouds, rest in one’s own unobstructed state relaxing into the objects of the six sense organs.
Just like water always falling, rest undistracted at all times and in all activities.

The Buddha was for hard work, individual effort, individual responsibility. Buddhism has precepts, but they are voluntary and nothing was compulsory in terms of commandments. Therefore, the Buddha was a Libertarian.

The Buddha was the ultra-Compassionate One; spoke out against greed, attachments, worldly desires. Therefore, the Buddha was a Democrat.

The Buddha was the ultra-Compassionate One; wanted to help all out of suffering; knew that human birth was rare and we must protect the only home we have. Therefore, the Buddha was an environmentalist / Green Party.

To be a deep ecologist, one merely has to subscribe the eight-point platform. I don't recall seeing a requirement for belief in rebirth and karma included.

The Deep Ecology Platform

1. The well-being and flourishing of human and nonhuman life on Earth have value in themselves (synonyms: inherent worth, intrinsic value, inherent value). These values are independent of the usefulness of the nonhuman world for human purposes.

2. Richness and diversity of life forms contribute to the realization of these values and are also values in themselves.

3. Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital needs.

4. Present human interference with the nonhuman world is excessive, and the situation is rapidly worsening.

5. The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantial decrease of the human population. The flourishing of nonhuman life requires such a decrease.

6. Policies must therefore be changed. The changes in policies affect basic economic, technological, and ideological structures. The resulting state of affairs will be deeply different from the present.

7. The ideological change is mainly that of appreciating life quality (dwelling in situations of inherent worth) rather than adhering to an increasingly higher standard of living. There will be a profound awareness of the difference between big and great.

8. Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation directly or indirectly to participate in the attempt to implement the necessary changes.

My point is that the goals of DE may be noble, but the method in which its proponents sometimes disseminate their ideas and the attitude they have toward people is not helping to win supporters for DE's cause. Someone called them "the ivory tower brigade", which I find quite fitting.

I request that you substantiate why you think that my view is short-sighted: I don't think that the goals of deep ecology can be effectively pursued other than by a commitment to a belief in karma and rebirth (or even a belief in serial reincarnation may be necessary) and to according action.

I don't disagree with any of that, but I think it's insufficient as a philosophical framework.

My issue with various secular approaches is that secularists refuse to or are unable to teach people how to find ultimate satisfaction in what in dharmic terms would be considered sensual or worldly pursuits. (Schumacher had to turn to religion.)

I once bought a camera; it came with a user manual and one of the sections of the manual said "Learn how to enjoy presentations". Well, the manual didn't teach how to enjoy presentations, it just taught how to make them. I felt betrayed. It didn't deliver what it promised. This same experience repeats with so many secular propositions for how to find worth and meaning in this world and in worldly pursuits: they don't deliver.

Sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tactile sensations, and ideas are fleeting and so are the pleasures that come with them. This is undeniable, and people do know that, even if just intuitively.
Yes, trees, meadows, clean rivers, giraffes etc. etc. are beautiful, but the pleasures one gets from them are fleeting, and therefore cannot serve as a reliable foundation for changing one's attitude to life and the world.

Title: Re: Deep Ecology

Unknown said:
1. Left biocentrism is a left focus or theoretical tendency within the
deep ecology movement, which is subversive of the existing industrial
society. It accepts and promotes the eight-point Deep Ecology Platform
drawn up by Arne Naess and George Sessions. Left biocentrism holds up
as an ideal, identification, solidarity, and compassion  with all life. "Left"
as used in left biocentrism, means anti-industrial and anti-capitalist, but
not necessarily socialist. The expressions 'left biocentrism' or 'left
ecocentrism' are used interchangeably.


2. Left biocentrism accepts the view that the Earth belongs to no one.
While raising a number of criticisms, left biocentrism is meant to
strengthen, not undermine, the deep ecology movement which identifies
with all life.


3. Left biocentrism says that individuals must take responsibility for
their actions and be socially accountable. Part of being individually
responsible is to practice voluntary simplicity, so as to minimize one's
own impact upon the Earth.


4. Left biocentrists are concerned with social justice and class issues,
but within a context of ecology. To move to a deep ecology world, the
human species must be mobilized, and a concern for social justice is a
necessary part of this mobilization. Left biocentrism is for the
redistribution of wealth, nationally and internationally.


5. Left biocentrism opposes economic growth and consumerism.
Human societies must live within ecological limits so that all other
species may continue to flourish. We believe that bioregionalism,
not globalism, is necessary for sustainability. The perspective of the
late German Green philosopher Rudolf Bahro is accepted that, for
world-wide sustainability, industrialized countries need to reduce
their impact upon the Earth to about one tenth of what it is at the
present time. It is also incumbent upon non-industrialized nations to
become sustainable and it is necessary for industrialized nations to
help on this path.


6. Left biocentrism holds that individual and collective spiritual
transformation is important to bring about major social change, and to
break with industrial society. We need inward transformation, so that
the interests of all species override the short-term self-interest of the
individual, the family, the community, and the nation.


7. Left biocentrism believes that deep ecology must be applied to
actual environmental issues and struggles, no matter how socially
sensitive, e.g. population reduction, aboriginal issues, workers'
struggles, etc.


8. Social ecology, eco-feminism and eco-marxism, while raising
important questions, are all human-centered and consider human-to-
human relations within society to be more important and, in the final
analysis, determine society's relationship to the natural world. Left
biocentrism believes that an egalitarian, non-sexist, non-discriminating
society, a highly desirable goal, can still be exploitive towards the Earth.


9. Left biocentrists are "movement greens" in basic orientation. They
are critical of existing Green political parties, which have come to an
accommodation with industrial society and have no accountability to the
deep ecology movement.


10. To be politically relevant, deep ecology needs to incorporate the
perspective advanced by left biocentrism.

Then the usual racist and sexist recriminations began to be repeated again [even while social welfare programs for capitalists were expanded at an astonishing rate], and welfare programs, never more than a small fraction of the budget, were undermined and eliminated, especially under Clinton.

In other words, Republicans definitely believe in corporate welfare. They just don't believe in welfare for the poor, women, blacks and latinos.

I am keen about such ideas, but I think the problem is they don't really constitute an alternative economic model. They tend to be fringe, in the way that 'green parties' are generally parties of protest, rather than genuine alternative governments.

It would take a lot to create a real alternative economic model. I think one of the many enormous structural problems, is that consumerism and endless growth and the stimulation of desire is essential to the capitalist model. Imagine if you had a model where the ideal was 'cultivation of wisdom'? It is actually hard to imagine - but I suppose that is one of the ideas behind a classical book in this tradition, Schumacher's 'Small is Beautiful'. It would take more than a different economic model, more like a very different mentality.  Actually, I guess Schumacher is a good model in this area.  I admit, I haven't done a lot of study about these things. (I have got The Value of Nothing, by Raj Patel, and I think I have Prosperity without Growth here somewhere.)

I guess, to be honest, I would actually be in a position to get 'off the grid' if I converted all my city equity into a country freehold (I'm in one of the most expensive cities in the world to own property, as it happens). But, wife is totally against such ideas.

Malcolm wrote:
The fundamental difference in approach is that shallow environmentalism seeks to maintain the industrial, capitalist, growth-oriented, market economy status quo.

Deep ecology is by definition anti-capitalist, anti-industrialist, and anti-class . To be a deep ecologist then is to consistently act in ways which foster the eventual elimination of capitalism, industrial civilization and class.

David Foreman's views on immigration, for example, are shallow inso far as they reinforce class distinctions by refusing to allow indigenous people impoverished by NAFTA from crossing into the USA on the excuse that "more people = more land degradation."

Forman's chief error, like his guru's Edward Abbey, is assuming there was ever a "wild" America. We know that Native People in the Americas systematically managed their environment in a manner which fostered the diversity and health of the ecosystem (after they systematically hunted American megafauna into extinction). The forest fires we experience regularly in the West are chiefly a result of shallow environmental practices which assumed an unpopulated primeval wilderness through which humans moved lightly, if at all.

And of course it is well known that Edward Abbey was a complete racist, whose views on ecology are anything but deep:
