The thing is that even with modern physics (if we go that route) it’s hard to argue for the “real existence” (I.e. “outside”) of anything beyond just obstruction via…I don’t know, probability fields or something.

So, all *experience* is of the mind, and we can only ever know of “outside” existence via inference.

Malcolm wrote:
No object, no experience. This can be known through direct perception and not inference. If you argue that all experience is inferential, than awakening is impossible, since it is also reduced to an inference.

Can sentient beings ever hope to know with precise accuracy the exact nature of that liquid substance in all its aspects and its nature? Sure, when one of them attains buddhahood.

In the meantime, functionality is the best measure of conventionality, which is why Meru cosmology could never be functional, not even when it was current. On the other hand, we did not have the tech to fly to the moon even 100 years ago, so it is moot. Nevertheless, Meru cosmology would never have permitted us to fly to the moon, and therefore, it was always a dysfunctional cosmology on a conventional level, but no one needed to question this for millenia.

There are always people who will forever go down the idealist rabbit hold of Bishop Berkley and what not, but at least Dzogchen teachings firmly maintain, conventionally speaking, the objective existence of outer objects, contra the metaphysics of yogacāra, even in its Madhyamaka version.

A Sutra in the Ratnakuṛa collection, Taisho 310, called the Definitive Vinaya in Chang's translation, will explain this point.

Bodhisattva monks are not prohibited from breaking any of the samvara of śrāvakas providing it is done with bodhicitta.

In the Nāgārjuna tradition of bodhisattva vows, the downfall of claiming realization of emptiness, when you do not have it, applies only to so-called "acute" practitioners, not average practitioners.

In the Yogacāra system, it is a downfall not break engage in a nonvirtue if performed out of compassion. You can read these in Buddhist Ethics by Kongtrul.

In short, the only real downfall in Mahāyāna is abandoning aspirational bodhicitta.

What makes something conventional is whether or not something is functional. Asserting there is nothing outside the mind renders cognition dysfunctional, unless one then substitutes an elaborate metaphysics to account for the cognition of sense objects, for example, yogacāra.

To Malcolms point, the opioid demand issue in the US is homegrown. It might be an arbitrary distinction, but the most China can be accused of here is taking advantage of that, the demand was already here. Having worked with a bunch of opioid users myself I’ve seen this firsthand and heard the stories.

Ayu said:
I watched a documentary on the problem and it was said there that the beginner drugs are given by doctors in the US. The addiction starts with legal tranquilizers and such medicaments.
As soon as those patients get that heroine is much cheaper than the stuff they have to buy in the drugstore the tragedy goes ahead.

Malcolm wrote:
The real story was that as people become more and more addicted to Oxycontin, Perdue began upping the dosages. Perdue originally sold Oxycontin as a nonaddictive opioid under the theory it was time released. But it was bullshit, of course. People became very addicted to it, and finally, in roughly 2006, the feds put an end to it. There was a time in the US, where drugstores started to refuse to carry it because of constant robberies.

When Oxy was not longer easily available, cartels stepped in with cheap Mexican heroin, as I mentioned above (which is incidentally much safer than fentanyl). However, dealers in the US began mixing fentanyl with heroin, my state, Massachusetts was ground zero for this, as the Parts Unkown episode by Bourdain illustrates: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4181346/ One of the towns in this is Greenfield, my country seat.

It is very easy to ship fentanyl in the mail. This is the main way it is smuggled into the US and Europe.

The solution is not a drug war (what are we going to do, invade Sinaloa? Good luck). The solution is breaking the back of the cartels by legalizing or decriminalizing some drugs and levying vice taxes to pay for the treatment programs. We have been doing this for alcohol forever.

Malcolm wrote:
Extraordinary proof is required for extraordinary claims.

The opioid crisis was caused largely by Perdue Pharma and the Sackler family.

When the US caught them in addicting millions of people to opioids, the cartels responded by supplying cheap Mexican dope to the US markets. They soon figured out it was cheaper to buy fentanyl from China and repackage it. China started to crack down on fentanyl shipments in 2019. China is clearly aware this is a big optics problem for them and that it makes them look bad. So they have taken measures. China is also a country where corruption is very high, because their markets have not been well regulated up to this point. Markets don't function well where there is excessive corruption, because trust is not there. Functioning markets require a high level of trust, for example, trade between US and Canada. One of Xi's main programs is the elimination of corruption in all sectors of Chinese business. He has been surprisingly effective in this. Nevertheless:

China’s May 2019 fentanyl scheduling announcement has changed the way illicit vendors operate as Chinese authorities have ramped up investigations of known manufacturing sites, cracked down on websites selling illicit fentanyl, begun to enforce shipping rules, and created special investigation teams.

The commission voted unanimously to control three fentanyl precursors by adding them to the list of chemicals to the 1988 Convention Against Illicit Traffic of Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances – obligating nations signed onto the convention to implement regulations on the manufacture and distribution of the chemicals, which in turn makes it harder for smugglers to gain access.

Kim O'Hara said:
It's not rubbish because it's wrong but misleading because it not at all relevant to our situation now. Talking about the climate of five million or five hundred million years ago as though it means anything for our current situation is either ignorance (which should be remedied) or deliberate deceit through misdirection (which should be called out). Let's assume ignorance and do something about it.

The time frame which concerns us is the time since modern humans first appeared, roughly half a million years ago, and especially since our settled culture of farms and cities first appeared, roughly 10 000 years ago.
If you compare that to Malcolm's first graph you will see that it aligns perfectly with a period of very stable climate which lasted all the way up to about 1900. That is the climate we need. It is the climate we are adapted to, the climate our crops and animals are adapted to, the sea levels our ports are built for, the weather our houses are built for, etc, etc. And when it changes too far, too fast, we can't adapt fast enough and neither can other living creatures.
The results, which we're already seeing, are crop failures, starvation, climate refugees, mass extinctions ... but surely you know all that.

What things were like five million or five hundred million years ago is of scientific interest only, just like the exact size of Saturn's moons or the wavelength of red light.

The Lion Tantra is pretty long.....Is it the second longest one after the Rangshar?

Malcolm wrote:
We are in volume two of the Adzom Parma published in 1977.

The next longest tantra of the 17 after the Rangshar is the ancillary tantra, called the Self-Originated Perfection, rdzogs pa rang byung, which contains many ritual methods. It is the last in this collection. It has very little direct Dzogchen content. It mostly concerns methods practitioners need, such as rites for dealing with obstacles from nāgas and so on, rites for guiding the dead through the bardo, details of empowerment rites, etc. It is very interesting for these reasons.

The Sound Tantra, which is the root tantra of all Dzogchen teachings, is the next longest after that. Then the Invincible Lion, String of Pearls, etc.

Effective May 1, 2019, China officially controlled all forms of fentanyl as a class of drugs. This fulfilled the commitment that President Xi made during the G-20 Summit. The implementation of the new measure includes investigations of known fentanyl manufacturing areas, stricter control of internet sites advertising fentanyl, stricter enforcement of shipping regulations, and the creation of special teams to investigate leads on fentanyl trafficking. These new restrictions have the potential to severely limit fentanyl production and trafficking from China. This could alter China’s position as a supplier to both the United States and Mexico.

Here is recent report (Feb, 2022) assembled by the Rand Corporation. It covers the whole issue up to where we are today. As I indicated, Mexico is the main producer of synthetic opiods today. There is just no argument about that.

Jesse said:
Mexico is the principal source of this illicit fentanyl and its analogues today.* In Mexico, cartels manufacture these
poisons in clandestine laboratories with ingredients—precursor chemicals—sourced largely from the People’s
Republic of China (PRC).

...

Since then, the dominant source of illegally sourced fentanyl has been Mexico. The drug is manufactured in illegal
laboratories there using precursors from Asia—mainly the PRC—and is trafficked principally by land into the
United States. Fentanyl coming from Mexico is often of very low purity—generally, in powder form around or
slightly above 10 percent—but now accounts for almost all the fentanyl that law enforcement has seized since late
2019. Trafficking in synthetic opioids has increased in part because of its low cost: It is cheaper to illegally
manufacture fentanyl or a fentanyl analogue than it is to grow poppies, extract the raw materials from them, and
produce heroin.

...

Today, Mexico-based TCOs are the main producer of illegally manufactured heroin and synthetic opioids, mostly
fentanyl, that are trafficked into the United States. Further, according to several experts, fentanyl production
capacity appears to be increasing, illegal producers could be seeking to diversify sources from which to obtain the
primary materials.

Fentanyl overdoses have surged to the leading cause of death for adults between the ages of 18 and 45, according to an analysis of U.S. government data.

Between 2020 and 2021, nearly 79,000 people between 18 and 45 years old — 37,208 in 2020 and 41,587 in 2021 — died of fentanyl overdoses, the data analysis from opioid awareness organization Families Against Fentanyl shows.

It is taught that Jetsun Milarepa experienced terrible poverty during His years of practice at least in part because, when He first became a student of Marpa Lotsawa, He offered His Teacher an empty pot. Marpa Lotsawa filled the pot with chang (Tibetan "beer"). Thus in Je Mila's later years He had abundant provisions. Both of these outcomes are based on the principle of dependent origination. This teaching underscores the karmic importance of always giving offerings for any Dharma one receives.

Apparently, “boundary-less” is an operational concept in Russian political rhetoric:

Queequeg said:
The mature Ilyin rejected the rule of law in favor of the arbitrariness—proizvol—of fascism. Having given up hope that Russia could be governed by law, he presented lawlessness (proizvol) as a patriotic virtue. Putin followed the same trajectory, citing Ilyin as his authority. When he first ran for president in 2000, he spoke of the need for a “dictatorship of the law.” Those two concepts contradicted each other, and one of them fell away. Running for president in 2012, Putin rejected the idea of a European Russia, which meant ignoring external incentives that favored the rule of law. Instead, proizvol would be presented as redemptive patriotism. The operative concept in the Russian language today is bespredel, boundary-less-ness, the absence of limits, the ability of a leader to do anything. The word itself arose from criminal jargon.

On this logic, Putin was not a failed statesman but a national redeemer. What the EU might describe as failures of governance were to be experienced as the flowering of Russian innocence.

The four fold classification system comes from the Vajramāla tantra, so 9th century.

The classification of tantras into kriya, carya, and yoga is earlier than Shingon, and is contempoary with Amoghavajra. The mid-eighth century Indian master, Buddhagupta, author of detailed commentaries on the Mahāvairocana Abhisambodhi, was the originator of the three-fold division.

The classification system that seems to have originated in Tibet is the classification of the three inner tantras into mahā, anu, and ati. However, even here, there is evidence that it is an eighth century arrangement, since it is a feature of Padmasambhava's rosary of views.

Formally received Tokudo, three sets of vows, and practice commitments from a Shingon-shu temple in Japan run by my Teacher and Master.

The funny thing is I have spent far more time as a Pure Land practitioner at Zojoji Temple in Tokyo and then some years at a Kanagawa Rinzai temple. I would be lying if I said I didn't think often about having a long sit-down with my Shingon teacher about shifting over to Ji-shu Pure Land (my family Danka, for what it's worth) or perhaps taking one of the wonderful 真宗学 academic courses on offer and delving into the arcana of Pure Land theory. I have a feeling given my age and limited memory powers I will never be  able to advance to Ajari status in Shingon, not that it matters all that much. There are a few specialized practices I would like to be initiated into. It sure gets pricy collecting Shingon permissions, vestments, implements....ive already spent... well, why grumble? It was worth every yen.

So after all these years in Japan knocking around different temples I've finally taken the plunge. Ami not allowed a little public victory lap in this egotistical thread?

Samsara is a strange place. I've been a farmer, a washing machine factory worker,  I spent time semi homeless living on 7 bucks a week. I earned full university  degrees in Western Philosophy and Chinese History, been a certified Geopolitical strategist with a aide order of Cyber Warfare accreditation, and finally it seems a Shingon practitioner.Hopefully my story ends there, but not quite yet.

Magnus, sorry bud, he was very clear that Mandarava, etc., was anuyoga. Why did he emphasize anuyoga? Because anuyoga’s view of the basis is the same as Dzogchen. Why is anuyoga lower than Dzogchen? Because anuyoga regards ati as a result. So your assertion, “if the view is ati, then everything is ati” is not correct. There is also no creation or completion stage in Dzogchen.

Between 2000 and 2008, during Putin’s first two terms as president, the Russian economy grew at an average rate of almost 7% per annum. Putin won his war in Chechnya. The government exploited high world market prices of natural gas and oil to distribute some export profits throughout the Russian population. The instability of the Yeltsin order had passed, and many Russians were understandably pleased and grateful. Russia also enjoyed a stable position in foreign affairs. Putin offered NATO Russia’s support after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. In 2002, he spoke favorably of “European culture” and avoided portraying NATO as an adversary. In 2004, Putin spoke in favor of European Union membership for Ukraine, saying that such an outcome would be in Russia’s economic interest. He spoke of the enlargement of the European Union as extending a zone of peace and prosperity to Russia’s borders. In 2008, he attended a NATO summit.

Snyder, Timothy. The Road to Unfreedom (pp. 47-48). Crown. Kindle Edition.


No Russian leader feared a NATO invasion in 2011 or 2012, or even pretended to. In 2012, American leaders believed that they were pursuing a “reset” of relations with Russia. When Mitt Romney referred to Russia as America’s “number one geopolitical foe” in March 2012, he was ridiculed. Almost no one in the American public or media was paying attention to Moscow. Russia did not even figure in American public opinion polls about global threats and challenges. The European Union and the United States were presented as threats because Russian elections were faked. In winter 2011 and spring 2012, Russian television channels and newspapers generated the narrative that all who protested electoral fraud were paid by Western institutions. The effort began on December 8, 2011, with the reporting of Putin’s claim that Clinton had initiated the protests.

Snyder, Timothy. The Road to Unfreedom (p. 55). Crown. Kindle Edition.

Until 2012, Russian leaders spoke favorably of European integration. Yeltsin accepted Europe as a model, at least rhetorically. Putin described the approach of the EU to Russia’s border as an opportunity for cooperation. The eastward enlargement of NATO in 1999 was not presented by Putin as a threat. Instead, he tried to recruit the United States or NATO to cooperate with Russia to address what he saw as common security problems. After the United States was attacked by Islamist terrorists in 2001, Putin offered to cooperate with NATO in territories that bordered Russia. Putin did not present the EU enlargement of 2004 as a threat. On the contrary, he spoke favorably that year of future EU membership for Ukraine. In 2008, Putin attended the NATO summit in Bucharest. In 2009, Medvedev allowed American aircraft to fly over Russia to supply troops in Afghanistan. In 2010, Russia’s ambassador to NATO, the radical nationalist Dmitry Rogozin, expressed his concern that NATO would leave Afghanistan. Rogozin complained of NATO’s lack of fighting spirit, its “mood of capitulation.” He wanted NATO troops at Russia’s border.

We’ve been hearing voices both past and present saying that the reason for what has happened is, as George Kennan put it, the strategic blunder of the eastward expansion of nato. The great-power realist-school historian John Mearsheimer insists that a great deal of the blame for what we’re witnessing must go to the United States. I thought we’d begin with your analysis of that argument.

I have only the greatest respect for George Kennan. John Mearsheimer is a giant of a scholar. But I respectfully disagree. The problem with their argument is that it assumes that, had nato not expanded, Russia wouldn’t be the same or very likely close to what it is today. What we have today in Russia is not some kind of surprise. It’s not some kind of deviation from a historical pattern. Way before nato existed—in the nineteenth century—Russia looked like this: it had an autocrat. It had repression. It had militarism. It had suspicion of foreigners and the West. This is a Russia that we know, and it’s not a Russia that arrived yesterday or in the nineteen-nineties. It’s not a response to the actions of the West. There are internal processes in Russia that account for where we are today.

I would even go further. I would say that nato expansion has put us in a better place to deal with this historical pattern in Russia that we’re seeing again today. Where would we be now if Poland or the Baltic states were not in nato? They would be in the same limbo, in the same world that Ukraine is in. In fact, Poland’s membership in nato stiffened nato’s spine. Unlike some of the other nato countries, Poland has contested Russia many times over. In fact, you can argue that Russia broke its teeth twice on Poland: first in the nineteenth century, leading up to the twentieth century, and again at the end of the Soviet Union, with Solidarity. So George Kennan was an unbelievably important scholar and practitioner—the greatest Russia expert who ever lived—but I just don’t think blaming the West is the right analysis for where we are.

Liberal internationalists hold that world politics requires institutional cooperation and political integration in response to relentlessly rising economic and security interdependence. Liberal internationalists across the past two centuries have considered a global architecture of rules and institutions necessary to protect liberal democracy and realize basic human interests. They have not always kept the best company, and their history is tainted by colonialism, imperialism, slavery, racism, and sexism. Yet liberals have also led the efforts to end these practices.

Correction, oh right, you scampered off before you could read the reply...


The Situation at Chernobyl Is Deteriorating

The defunct site of the infamous 1986 meltdown has lost power two weeks after it was seized by Russian forces. Experts fear another nuclear disaster looms.

...

“To have a long-term loss of power is certainly a concern,” says Ed Lyman, a senior global security scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists and coauthor of the book Fukushima: The Story of a Nuclear Disaster. Some of Chernobyl’s waste has been transferred into dry casks, but considerable quantities of fuel rods remain in a pool that requires cooling. That’s where the biggest risks currently are. “Without electrical power to the cooling pumps, the spent fuel pool will start heating up,” Lyman says. Water will gradually evaporate or boil away, exposing the fuel rods and releasing radioactive gasses. 

Chernobyl’s New Safe Confinement structure also needs electricity. This is the facility built around the concrete “sarcophagus” that surrounds what’s left of the damaged reactor Number Four, which melted down in the 1986 disaster. The confinement structure’s ventilation system must run to prevent the exposed nuclear fuel within it from becoming more hazardous. Without power, the site’s 1.5-billion-euro decommissioning program could be imperiled, Claire Corkhill, an expert on nuclear material degradation at the University of Sheffield in the United Kingdom, wrote on Twitter and in an email to WIRED.

...

“The Russians have been incredibly careless. They not only attacked a nuclear power plant; they also attacked a nuclear laboratory, an accelerator complex that’s designed to produce neutrons,” says Bob Rosner, a physicist at the University of Chicago and former chair of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists’ Science and Security Board. 

And the threat won’t be over as long as Russia continues to bombard Ukraine with missiles and fly warplanes overhead. US Department of Energy researchers have studied whether nuclear reactors could withstand an airplane crash, Dalnoki-Veress says. They cannot. And missiles fly faster and are more penetrating. An impact on a fuel pool could be highly damaging, likely spreading dangerous radioactive material all over. That’s why prohibiting combat near nuclear facilities should be a top priority in Ukraine-Russia negotiations, Dalnoki-Veress argues: “No reactor in the world can withstand a missile strike. It’s important to not have any fighting near these facilities. It’s a no-brainer.”

And she might do well to read Hayek's "The Road to Serfdom." You might too:

Brunelleschi said:
It is not difficult to see what must be the consequences when democracy embarks upon a course of planning which in its execution requires more agreement than in fact exists. The people may have agreed on adopting a system of directed economy because they have been convinced that it will produce great prosperity. In the discussions leading to the decision, the goal of planning will have been described by some such term as “common welfare,” which only conceals the absence of real agreement on the ends of planning. Agreement will in fact exist only on the mechanism to be used. But it is a mechanism which can be used only for a common end; and the question of the precise goal toward which all activity is to be directed will arise as soon as the executive power has to translate the demand for a single plan into a particular plan. Then it will appear that the agreement on the desirability of planning is not supported by agreement on the ends the plan is to serve. The effect of the people’s agreeing that there must be central planning, without agreeing on the ends, will be rather as if a group of people were to commit themselves to take a journey together without agreeing where they want to go: with the result that they may all have to make a journey which most of them do not want at all.

The comparisons are completely apt. But if you won't see it, well, that's not my problem. But you should understand that Putin revived a Russian fascist author named Ivan Ilyin, whose works are wildly popular in Russia these days.

Johnny Dangerous said:
After a new Russian Federation emerged from the defunct Soviet Union in 1991, Ilyin’s short book Our Tasks began to circulate in new Russian editions, his collected works were published, and his ideas gained powerful supporters. He had died forgotten in Switzerland; Putin organized a reburial in Moscow in 2005. Ilyin’s personal papers had found their way to Michigan State University; Putin sent an emissary to reclaim them in 2006. By then Putin was citing Ilyin in his annual presidential addresses to the general assembly of the Russian parliament. These were important speeches, composed by Putin himself. In the 2010s, Putin relied upon Ilyin’s authority to explain why Russia had to undermine the European Union and invade Ukraine. When asked to name a historian, Putin cited Ilyin as his authority on the past.

Faith that technology serves freedom opens the way to his spectacle. As distraction replaces concentration, the future dissolves in the frustrations of the present, and eternity becomes daily life. The oligarch crosses into real politics from a world of fiction, and governs by invoking myth and manufacturing crisis. crisis. In the 2010s, one such person, Vladimir Putin, escorted another, Donald Trump, from fiction to power.

Basically, it boils down to this for me: if we do not support democratically elected governments abroad, our democracy, imperfect though it may be, will fail here in the United States. We also need to recognize that Putin's attempts to degrade democracy wherever he can are real, are an explicit part of Russian foreign policy, and are driven by ideology as well, an ideology no less authoritarian than Soviet-style communism. In short, Putin is a fascist, and Russia is a fascist country.

They fought against both the Ottomans and the Wahhabis in the 18th and 19th centuries.

With the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1918, a Zaydi monarchy took power in North Yemen called the Mutawakkilite Kingdom. The ruler, or imam, was both a secular ruler and a spiritual leader.

I have a different interpretation of what a realist should conclude about the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its antecedents. I start from a different premise: Russia is not a great power. It is obviously a declining power, objectively so. Its only claims to global power status are its petroleum reserves, its nuclear arsenal, and our collective memories of the Cold War. Take those away, and Russia is no more a great power than Turkey was in 1935.

The Soviet Union lost the Cold War decisively. Its empire fell into pieces, its regional alliance disappeared, and most of its former allies joined NATO. Russia lost, and the Western alliance won. Given this, it is not NATO’s responsibility to protect Russian state security interests. It is Russia’s responsibility to give wide berth to NATO, recognizing—as every realist should—that the strong do what they will, the weak do what they must. Russian proclamations that it gets to prioritize Putin’s individual political survival over the logic of international relations are nothing more than idealist fantasies.

Objectively, no one wants to invade or destroy Russia, there are not and have never been plans for a NATO conquest of Russia. Russia had a good deal: they got to sell their petroleum and defend their territorial integrity with their aging nuclear arsenal. Invading Ukraine was a stupid strategic error made by a declining power that does not understand The Tragedy of Great Power Politics. In the immediate short run, Ukrainians will pay the prices for Russia’s strategic errors, but in the long run, Russia will bear the consequences. It has demonstrated clearly the limits of its force projection capabilities, and united NATO and the EU and a bunch of other hard-hearted neutral states at the same time. As I like to say, if you’ve lost Singapore and Switzerland….

See how this works? One goes quickly from a different premise about what the objective facts of the realist world are, and reasons through the questions of “how should the world work?” and “what should a policymaker do.”

Lots of people object to realist analyses because they lack a clear moral position on violence and individual liberty. I share these views. But I also despise this realist way of thinking because it is so indeterminate, and because it leads to statements about what states’ security interests which are, I think, either vacuous or hopelessly subjective.** And that is why Mearsheimer’s take is so exasperating.

However, given their lack of intrinsic value, acute price fluctuations, low trading efficiencies and huge energy consumption, they can hardly serve as currencies used in daily economic activities. In addition, cryptocurrencies are mostly speculative instruments, and therefore pose potential risks to financial security and social stability. Moreover, they have been employed as payment instruments for money-laundering and other illegal economic activities. To tackle the relatively big price fluctuation concern of cryptocurrencies, some commercial institutions launched so-called “stablecoins”, and tried to stabilize their values by pegging them to sovereign currencies or related assets. Some commercial institutions even plan to launch global stablecoins, which will bring risks and challenges to the international monetary system, payment and clearing system, monetary policies, cross-border capital flow management and etc.

More importantly, it is fiat currency, like the dollar:

E-CNY is the digital version of fiat currency issued by the PBOC and operated by authorized operators. It is a value-based, quasi-account-based and account-based hybrid payment instrument, with legal tender status and loosely-coupled account linkage. It has the following connotations:

The encryption features are present for storage, not for generating the currency:

E-CNY adopts a variety of technologies, including digital certificate system, digital signature, and encrypted storage to make double-spending, illegal duplication and counterfeit, transaction falsification, and repudiation unfeasible. A multi-layer security system has been initially established to guarantee that e-CNY has a safe life cycle and risks are manageable.

Here is the white paper:

E-CNY is not what you are representing it to be.

Cryptocurrency, sometimes called crypto-currency or crypto, is any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually and uses cryptography to secure transactions.

Apply pay is intermediated by your bank. E-CNY is digital cash that can be sent between parties while offline.

OED:

A digital currency in which transactions are verified and records maintained by a decentralized system using cryptography, rather than by a centralized authority.

Also known as the e-CNY, it’s designed to replace the cash and coins already in circulation. It is not a cryptocurrency like bitcoin, in part because it’s controlled and issued by the central bank. Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that isn’t backed by any central banks or a single administrator.

The whole point of crypto is that it is NOT administered and controlled by a central bank, that is, a government.

The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication, or Swift, is the financial-messaging infrastructure that links the world’s banks. Swift doesn’t handle actual money transfers itself. It is a messaging system, a secure way banks transmit transfer requests to each other. Money moving from one account to another often passes by multiple banks before landing in the final destination, particularly if it involves a foreign currency. Swift routes messages with instructions from one bank to another, allowing them to know where the money should ultimately land. The Belgium-based system is run by its member banks and handles millions of daily payment instructions across more than 200 countries and territories and 11,000 financial institutions. Iran and North Korea are cut off from it.

Second, Britain’s loss of reserve currency status contradicts assumptions of terminal decline. Of course, sterling’s displacement went hand in hand with the decline of the British Empire, but Britain’s wealth has ground inexorably higher in the 100 years since this process started -- and the pound remains a leading international currency.

Good day.

I would like to ask for the proper transliteration of དྷནྨ. I've tried the tools from THL to transliterate the word and hopefully get the Sanskrit, but it cannot read it for some reason. It says d+han+ma or dhanma(?). I've tried to check Tibetan dictionaries, but I cannot find it at all. I have a guess that it's དྷན which corresponds to the Sanskrit धन (dhána), but the Sanskrit doesn't decline to dháNMA (which is how I would transliterate the word I'm asking about). The closest I could find is धनम् (dhánam), which is both the nominative and accusative form of धन (dhána).

This is connected to my recent inquiry about a specific mantra of Vasudhara, and my research has led me to this last piece. Any leads or information would help, especially if it's from an actual text.

A question would be a great start, I suppose. Is there any textual evidence of དྷནྨ being used as the Tibetan transcription of धन (dhána) or धनम् (dhánam)?

Political consensus is partially (I’d largely, but trying to be fair) manufactured, not some organic will of the populace.

Malcolm wrote:
In a democracy, anytime any majority comes to agreement about an issue, the dissenting party will always claim their opponent's consensus is manufactured, a result of manipulation, "if only people knew the facts," and so on. It happens on both the right and the left. As a result, very broadly no one in a liberal democracy is 100% happy with much of what happens in their governments. But they are still responsible for what happens in their governments, 100% of the time. Democracy, as you know, is slow, messy, provides uneven results, and is generally inefficient in many ways. However, the general outcome of liberal democracy is that people are, over all, happier than in autocracies. We are more prosperous, and there are more opportunities for everyone. But not everyone's needs are met, nor can they be. That is a socialist fantasy.

The people do not have a unified will. There are too many of us, and too many of us have very different opinions about the world, so liberal democracies tend to represent an averaging out of the will of the people. For example, it was never the "unified will of the people" that the US should preserve slavery after the Revolution. Some people wanted slavery, some people opposed it. Eventually, slavery was ended. The point is that everyone gets a voice. Everyone gets a say. If they choose not to use that voice, that's their fault. If that voice is silenced, as in the voter suppression that plagues every election in our country, that needs to be dealt with. When we vote, we don't always get our way. But at least we get a say, unlike for example, in Putin's Russia,  Xi's China, Maduro's Venezuela, or Ortega's Nicaragua, etc. Because we get a say, slavery was ended, the work week was reduced from up to 80 hours a week to 40, civil rights laws were passed, and so on. But it is a slow, and not very attractive process. But it is very beneficial for us in the end, and well, I don't want to think of the alternative...

Fukuyama's point is very sound:

Liberalism is a doctrine, first enunciated in the 17th century, that seeks to control violence by lowering the sights of politics. It recognises that people will not agree on the most important things — such as which religion to follow — but that they need to tolerate fellow citizens with views different from their own.

That’s really beside the point, or rather it proves my point The machinations of “democracy” as far as war goes really have nothing to do with the will of the populace, but rather the will of PR people, weapons industry, large corporate interests, politicians with empire-forward agendas  etc. Of course everything can be a democratic decision somehow on paper.

The Iraq invasion was historically unpopular across the globe, obviously including here in the US.

Malcolm wrote:
No, it is the will of the people, since we elected these people. You want to change policies? Change the leadership.

The power of elections was proven by the Trump Administration. He managed to convince a sizable portion of our population to resume the disastrous isolationism of Hoover, and combined it with the graft and corruption of Mckinley. He undermined NATO, gutted State, etc.

That same power was proven by Biden's election, who has proven to be one of the most competent presidents we have had in years, by every metric you can imagine.

So, I just don't share your cynicism about our government, warts and all.

The lesson of Ukraine is, that when a people say and go to great lengths over decades to demonstrate that they want a liberal democracy, and do everything in their power to institute one, we should support it and defend it. Because frankly, liberal democracies are just better governments, and people are happier under them.

Problem solving involves concrete decision making, when it is based on wavering anxieties it’s not actually problem solving.

Take aways:

Our conditional deadline is June. Conditional because in June there will be no economy left in Russia – there will be nothing left. By and large, next week there will be a collapse (in Russia) to either of the two sides, simply because the situation cannot remain under current conditions.

...

By and large, Russia does not have an out. There are no options for a possible victory, only of losses – this is it.
100% we’ve repeated our mistake from last century, when we decided to kick the “weak” Japan in order to achieve a quick victory, and it turned our army was in a state of total calamity.

...

Now we are stuck waiting until some mentally screwed up advisor convinces the top to start a conflict with Europe, with demands to reduce the sanctions – they either loosen the sanctions or war. What if the West refuses? In that instance I won’t exclude that we will be pulled into a real international conflict, just like Hitler in 1939. Our “Z” will be equated to the Swastika.
Is there a possibility of a localized nuclear strike? Yes. Not for any military objectives. Such a weapon won’t help with the breach of the defenses. But with a goal of scaring everyone else (The West).

...

Our current position is like Germany in 1943-1944 – but that’s our STARTING position in Ukraine.

...

Third, and this is the most disgusting and sad, I personally do not believe in Putin’s will to sacrifice himself when he does not even allow his closest ministers and advisors to be in his vicinity. Whether it’s due to his fear of COVID or a possible assassination is irrelevant. If you are scared for the most trusted people to be near you, then how could you possibly choose to destroy yourself and those dearest to you.

All in defiance of an international order largely shaped by the United States that has kept the peace among great powers for seven decades. The Russian and Chinese challenge to this peaceful order has been developing for a number of years. Putin’s war has provided the cold shower needed to awaken democratic governments to the reality of a new world, a world in which our recent strategy — including the “pivot” to Asia — is woefully insufficient to meet the long-term challenges we face.

I stand corrected. I was unaware that the so-called Brahamajala Precept sūtra was this Chos kyi rgya mo. We have the Hinayāna Brahmajala sūtra in translation as well.

The title is Chos kyi rgya mo, which means roughly "Seal of the Dharma" (Chos kyi rgyal mo means Queen of Dharma). The Dege edition lists it as a translation from Chinese, with the legend, "translated from Chinese, edited according to the new dharma terminology." It is found in the Phangthangma catalogue.

It begins a little after the second fascicle of the Chinese text begins.

So, even though a portion of this text was translated into Tibetan, we really don't read this text. For example. the Fourth Shamar notes it is a dubious text specifically because of this passage:

"[H]e himself was named Siddhārtha. He left home at the age of seven; he attained enlightenment at thirty and came to be called Śākyamuni Buddha."

Pg. 40, BDK edition.

Not so, in 2014 there were quite a large number of storiesin the US Media about far right extremists traveling to Ukraine to fight the separatists(aka Russian mercenaries), including the politics and antisemitism of the Azov Battalion.

I also know at least one person who left Ukraine and moved to Israel because of their (legitimate) fear of the far right troops, however their perception was also contaminated with the idea that Soros is behind all of it.

However, not all the troops who have fought in Separatist regions are far right nationalists. Most are not. 400K people have served in the Donbas region. This is one reason why the Ukrainians are not going to lose this war, despite the punishment Putin is meeting out.

In any case, Putin started this by violating Ukrainian sovereignty when he illegally annexed the Crimea.

Of course there is a difference: the atman/soul/person, etc., asserted by nonBuddhists does not exist in the various manners in which they claim it does. It does exist in the manner which we claim it does, that is, as a mere imputation upon the series of aggregates. I think you need to reread Vasubandhu’ refutation of the self again.

The conventional use of pronouns does not negate the general Buddhist argument of the self being a convention,an imputation, and a mere designation.

Malcolm wrote:
958-1959: the U.S.S.R. vs. Finland
During the "Night Frost Crisis" of 1958 and 1959, Finnish-Soviet relations were fraught after the Communists were excluded from government and Karl-August Fagerholm, viewed as unfavorable to the Soviets, was appointed as prime minister. The U.S.S.R. used economic sanctions to force Fagerholm's resignation. The sanctions cost 1.1.% of the Finnish GNP.

1961-1965: the United States vs. Ceylon (Sri Lanka)
Between 1961 and 1965, the United States applied sanctions against the Dominion of Ceylon (what is now Sri Lanka) after the socialist government of Sirimavo Bandaranaike was accused of expropriating the assets of U.S. and British oil companies. The government fell in 1965, largely because of the economic effects of these sanctions, which cost 0.6% of the the country's GNP.

1982-1986: South Africa vs. Lesotho
South Africa applied economic pressure on Lesotho to make it return South African refugees with links to the African National Congress. After a military coup in Lesotho, South Africa lifted a blockade on the landlocked nation, and 60 ANC members were deported back home. The cost was estimated to be 5.1% of Lesotho's GNP.

1992-1993: the United States vs. Malawi
The United States (and other nations) significantly cut aid in 1992 in a bid to improve the democratic standards and human rights situation in Malawi. Malawi was largely reliant on aid (the sanctions were estimated to cost 6.6% of its GNP) and swiftly adopted more open policies. After a referendum, multi-party democracy was introduced in 1993, and aid was soon resumed.

1993: the United States vs. Guatemala
In 1993, after President Jorge Serrano dissolved Congress and said he would rule by decree, the United States and European nations threatened sanctions. Business owners, scared of the economic effects, helped force Serrano out of power and installed a new president, Ramiro de Leon Carpio. The economic cost was said to be 1.3% of Guatemala's GDP.

Who, motivated by compassion,
Taught the holy Dharma
For the abandonment of all [false] views. [Coghlan]

Malcolm wrote:
One, while in general the Coughlin translation is pretty good, it is not without its faults, bracketing [false] before views is misleading.

Two, pacifying proliferation (prapañcopaśamaṃ) and abandonment of all views (sarvadṛṣṭiprahāṇāya) are equivalent.

But there is no thesis here to defend, no affirming negation, if you will. There is here no negation of view to replace it with some other view.

If you want to get into the head of Nāgārjuna regarding the limits of holding a thesis (pratijñā), you should look at Westerhoff's study and translation of the Vaidalyaprakaṇa. It is a detailed refutation of the Nyāya's sixteen categories (padārtha). You should also look a the Vigrahavyavartani, also translated by Westerhoff.

If the result one wants is moksha, or higher rebirth, or a perfect lemon cheesecake, other methods exist for achieving those.

In other words, Mr. Sad Guru may offer a path that leads to a blissful something-or-other, but not to full liberation in the buddhist sense.
And from that it may be assumed that he is not “enlightened” in any sense of the word as it would be applied to Buddhism.

Aemilius said:
Making that sort of declarations is not what Shakyamuni recommends that one should do. It may cause one unnecessary (bad) karma saying things like that. You would perhaps do much better without it.

The buddhist goal is not so self-evident, if you would consider what the Mahayana says. Like for example: "there is no ignorance and no end of ignorance...", Heart of Perfection of Wisdom sutra, " ...no old age and death and no end of old age and death". Mahayana sutras unambiquosly say that the sravakayana nirvana is not ultimately true and not the final goal.

Europeans have also dropped, abruptly, some of their doubts about Ukraine’s membership in their institutions. On Monday, the European Parliament not only asked Zelensky to speak, by video, but gave him a standing ovation. Earlier today the parliamentarians, from all across the continent, voted to accept his application for EU membership for Ukraine. Accession to the EU is a long process, and it won’t happen immediately, even if Ukraine emerges intact from this conflict. But the idea has been broached. It is now part of the continent’s collective imagination. From being a distant place, badly understood, it is now part of what people mean when they say Europe…In the long run-up to this war, the conversation in Washington and Berlin was always focused on Putin and Joe Biden, Sergei Lavrov and Antony Blinken, NATO and Russia. This was the kind of talk that academics and pundits liked: big topics, big countries. In this conversation Ukraine was, as the political scientist John Mearsheimer put it in 2014, nothing more than “a buffer state of enormous strategic importance to Russia.” But the Ukrainians have now put themselves at the heart of the story, and they know it.

Then read Akutobhyā. It has the same stucture, and is much earlier than Buddhapalita, attributed to Nāgārjuna. It sets out the purpose for writing MMK, but it does not set out any ontological thesis to defend.

It's the only model of reasoning there is. If you want to interpret the MMK outside these parameters, I have nothing more to say to you other than that you are making a mistake.

“Sadly, we are treading back through old historical patterns that we said that we would never permit to happen again,” Hill told me.

Those old historical patterns include Western businesses who fail to see how they help build a tyrant’s war chest, admirers enamored of an autocrat’s “strength” and politicians’ tendency to point fingers inward for political gain instead of working together for their nation’s security.

But at the same time, Hill says it’s not too late to turn Putin back, and it’s a job not just for the Ukrainians or for NATO — it’s a job that ordinary Westerners and companies can assist in important ways once they grasp what’s at stake.

“Ukraine has become the front line in a struggle, not just between democracies and autocracies but in a struggle for maintaining a rules-based system in which the things that countries want are not taken by force,” Hill said. “Every country in the world should be paying close attention to this.”

...

Hill: You totally see it. Unfortunately, we have politicians and public figures in the United States and around Europe who have embraced the idea that Russia was wronged by NATO and that Putin is a strong, powerful man and has the right to do what he’s doing: Because Ukraine is somehow not worthy of independence, because it’s either Russia’s historical lands or Ukrainians are Russians, or the Ukrainian leaders are — this is what Putin says — “drug addled, fascist Nazis” or whatever labels he wants to apply here.

So sadly, we are treading back through old historical patterns that we said that we would never permit to happen again. The other thing to think about in this larger historic context is how much the German business community helped facilitate the rise of Hitler. Right now, everyone who has been doing business in Russia or buying Russian gas and oil has contributed to Putin’s war chest. Our investments are not just boosting business profits, or Russia’s sovereign wealth funds and its longer-term development. They now are literally the fuel for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

What everyone forgets about Cuba was that stationing the missiles there was a response to the US putting short-range missiles in Turkey.  The US instigated that conflict.

We can, with Ukraine, debate endlessly who is “responsible” in a causative sense, and that does matter, but we are where we are, and we need to find the least bad destination for this.  Right now that clearly does not involve a broadening of the conflict or a return to the prior status quo, unfortunately

Malcolm wrote:
Correct:


PeterC said:
To reinforce Western interests, President Eisenhower secured the unanimous approval of NATO states to position intermediate-range ballistic missiles (IRBMs) in Europe, but only Britain, Italy, and Turkey actually agreed to host the weapons. In October 1959, it was arranged to place fifteen Jupiter IRBMs in Turkey, with the Turkish government agreeing to keep the armaments sovereign to the US and to keep the negotiations and acceptance of the missiles secret from the Turkish nation.5

Earlier that year, Eisenhower predicted that positioning warheads near the USSR could cause a backlash and that “If Mexico or Cuba . . . began getting arms and missiles from [the Soviets], we would be bound to look on such developments with the gravest concern and . . . it would be imperative for us to take . . . even offensive military action.”6 John F. Kennedy, who took over the operation upon his 1961 inauguration, shared these concerns. He believed the Soviets would use the Turkish IRBMs to justify arming Cuba—if Turkey could attack across the Black Sea for the US, Cuba could attack across the Gulf of Mexico for the USSR—so, three months before the crisis, he urged US officials to see what needed to be done to remove the missiles, telling Undersecretary of State George Ball to progress the issue. However, Ball, after discussing the issue with the Turkish ambassador, allied with other State Department officials and decided to not try to remove the missiles so as to preserve US-Turkish relations.7

Putin is not only a psychopath who starts a war and then threatens nuclear war when faced with economical sanctions he is also an idiot who has not even managed to achieve what he tried to do. He basically started cold war all over again but Russia is nowhere near as strong or relevant in the whole scale as it was back in soviet times, so he frak up big time. He will get frak badly and Europe will wake up again. Germany just pledged a 100 billion this year alone and Putin will have strapped up NATO on all borders except China.

It is worth emphasising that Mearsheimer said that before the invasion. Pretty much everything I've been saying too refers to the crisis before the invasion. You seem to be intent on confounding the two.

For years talking about the allied war crimes in WW2 would subject one to accusations of being a cryptonazi, Hitler apologist etc. We are past that now. People like Kurt Vonnegut help make it acceptable. And you know, he was not a Nazi.

What I say is not about excusing the invasion, but helping understand how the crisis arose in the first place. The facile approach is to just chant the mantra Putin=Bad=Mad and be content with it. It's easy and clear. But it's not the truth. Well, I don't know, maybe now he has gone mad, but up until the invasion, most his foreign policy did make sense.

Malcolm wrote:
Dan, you have stated quite plainly that you feel that Putin's 2014 and 2022 invasions of the Ukraine are clearly just a response to how unfairly Putin has been treated by the West. You have marshaled the opinions of American political scientists in defense of your point of view. There are other American political scientists who disagree with this point of view. You've thrown shade on Ukrainian corruption, and conflated Ukraine's desire to be admitted to the EU with NATO membership. You've argued that NATO "broke" its promises to Russia, when its quite debatable that this is the case.

In short, you've pretty much sided with Russia entirely. That's fine, but Putin is a fascist, like his asset in Florida, and the entire MAGA wing of the GOP.

You may not think the "Liberal Hegemony" led by the US is a good thing. I happen to think it is a very good thing, and find it a preferable world order to the kind of world order envisioned by Putin, Xi, and the rest.

Jesus Christ we are still talking about Trump. He isn't president anymore.  Biden is. The man who has the power to do something right now is Biden.
The right-wing talking point that Biden is weak and inept and therefore emboldened Putin to invade Ukraine is belied by the united front the western world is presenting. After the former president tried to weaken NATO and even discussed withdrawing from the treaty, Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have managed to strengthen the alliance again. They have brought the G7 (the seven wealthiest liberal democracies), the European Union, and other partners and allies behind extraordinary economic sanctions, acting in concert to make those sanctions much stronger than any one country could impose.

They have managed to get Germany behind stopping the certification of Nord Stream 2, the gas pipeline from Russia to Germany that would have tied Europe more closely to Russia, and in what Marcel Dirsus, a German political scientist and fellow at the Institute for Security Policy at Kiel University, told the Washington Post was possibly “one of the biggest shifts in German foreign policy since World War II,” Germany is now sending weapons to Ukraine and has agreed to impose economic sanctions.

Biden has facilitated this extraordinary international cooperation quietly, letting European leaders take credit for the measures his own administration has advocated. It is a major shift from the U.S.’s previous periods of unilateralism and militarism, and appears to be far more effective.

The truth is a little more complicated. Iraq and Kuwait has an agreement about raising oil prices in concert. Kuwait broke that agreement, moreover, they were drilling under Iraq's border, according to Iraq. So what did Iraq do? They raided Kuwait, broke into people's houses and shops, and carried away art, gems, furniture, etc.

Naturally of course the Kuwaiti's were pissed, and then Bush got into it, because he saw a good opportunity to get rid of a former client from his CIA days.

No one forced these countries to join NATO. They begged to join NATO. Maybe it was a bad idea to let them in. That's up for debate. But there seems to be a consistent theme underlying all of this... Russia's conduct. Russia should have gotten its shit together decades ago. But instead, a small group of corrupt men stole control of all the resources. That is the genesis of Russia's problem right there.

After all, what caused this crisis in the first place? It’s very simple: the overwhelming desire of Ukrainians to live in an open, democratic society. Let us not forget what it was that enraged Putin and led him to invade Ukraine for the first time in 2014. It was not a Ukrainian declaration to seek NATO membership; it was the efforts of the Kyiv government (a pro-Russian government at the time) to finalize an “association agreement” with the European Union. When the president of Ukraine ultimately balked at this deal — under pressure from Russia — he was greeted by massive street protests, and the parliament voted him out of office. That is what triggered Putin’s first invasion of Ukraine.

Dan74 said:
Most of the primary sources about Soviet perceptions and goals are in Russian. But even if Shifrinson cannot use Russian sources, a few important items are available in English, including an illuminating interview with former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev in October 2014 that appeared in English translation. Shifrinson has definitely seen the interview (I sent a copy of it to him in November 2014), but he never cites it directly and instead paraphrases it inaccurately. In the interview, Gorbachev was asked whether the topic of NATO enlargement beyond eastern Germany ever came up during the negotiations in 1990 on German reunification. Gorbachev’s response was unequivocal: “The topic of ‘NATO expansion’ was not discussed at all [in 1990], and it wasn’t brought up in those years. I say this with full responsibility. Western leaders didn’t bring it up, either.”5 Instead of citing these comments, Shifrinson briefly and misleadingly paraphrases Gorbachev as having remarked: “NATO expansion may not have been explicitly discussed in 1990” (p. 13). This cursory paraphrase misrepresents what Gorbachev actually said. The former Soviet leader did not use the equivocal formulation “NATO expansion may not have been explicitly discussed.” He said very plainly that NATO expansion “was not discussed at all” and “was not brought up.”

The article is dense, but it's highly cited, and provides evidence in the form of photos of documents from the events.
The documents reinforce former CIA Director Robert Gates’s criticism of “pressing ahead with expansion of NATO eastward [in the 1990s], when Gorbachev and others were led to believe that wouldn’t happen.”[1] The key phrase, buttressed by the documents, is “led to believe.”

President George H.W. Bush had assured Gorbachev during the Malta summit in December 1989 that the U.S. would not take advantage (“I have not jumped up and down on the Berlin Wall”) of the revolutions in Eastern Europe to harm Soviet interests; but neither Bush nor Gorbachev at that point (or for that matter, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl) expected so soon the collapse of East Germany or the speed of German unification.[2]

The first concrete assurances by Western leaders on NATO began on January 31, 1990, when West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher opened the bidding with a major public speech at Tutzing, in Bavaria, on German unification. The U.S. Embassy in Bonn (see Document 1) informed Washington that Genscher made clear “that the changes in Eastern Europe and the German unification process must not lead to an ‘impairment of Soviet security interests.’ Therefore, NATO should rule out an ‘expansion of its territory towards the east, i.e. moving it closer to the Soviet borders.’” The Bonn cable also noted Genscher’s proposal to leave the East German territory out of NATO military structures even in a unified Germany in NATO.[3]

This latter idea of special status for the GDR territory was codified in the final German unification treaty signed on September 12, 1990, by the Two-Plus-Four foreign ministers (see Document 25). The former idea about “closer to the Soviet borders” is written down not in treaties but in multiple memoranda of conversation between the Soviets and the highest-level Western interlocutors (Genscher, Kohl, Baker, Gates, Bush, Mitterrand, Thatcher, Major, Woerner, and others) offering assurances throughout 1990 and into 1991 about protecting Soviet security interests and including the USSR in new European security structures. The two issues were related but not the same. Subsequent analysis sometimes conflated the two and argued that the discussion did not involve all of Europe. The documents published below show clearly that it did.

And NATO didn’t take advantage of anything. Nations have to apply to enter NATO. They have to meet certain standards:

To join the Alliance, nations are expected to respect the values of the North Atlantic Treaty, and to meet certain political, economic and military criteria, set out in the Alliance’s 1995 Study on Enlargement.


In any case, what initially ticked Putin off was Ukraine’s move to join the EU in 2014, which is what lead to the invasion of crimea and the removal of Yakunovich by the Ukrainian parliament.

For 30 years many of us in the military have been saying extending NATO East against our explicit promise would cause a military crisis. We pushed for years. This was inevitable.

Malcolm complaining about thermobaric weapons is especially pathetic. Weapons widely used by US forces in it's illegal occupation of Iraq and used extensively in Fallujah on civilians.

Malcolm wrote:
For the record, I opposed both Iraq wars and Afghanistan.

As for NATO expansion, you are incorrect. There was no such promise at all:

Nemo said:
The main issue highlighted by the crisis on the Ukraine borders over the past few months has predominantly focused on the role of Nato and the friction over the eastward expansion of the alliance. This has been a constant message emerging from the Kremlin: that the Nato membership of many parts of the old Soviet Bloc, and the prospective membership of Ukraine to the alliance, poses a threat to Russian sovereignty.

But the decision to accept former members of the Warsaw Pact, the defensive alliance which included the USSR and several eastern European countries, is being subject to a revisionist history. This is perpetuating a myth that Nato promised not to expand eastwards after the Soviet Union dissolved.


In 2014, the former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev marked the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin wall by noting in an interview that that Nato’s enlargement “was not discussed at all” at the time:

Not a single Eastern European country raised the issue, not even after the Warsaw Pact ceased to exist in 1991. Western leaders didn’t bring it up, either.

There was, he said, no promise not to enlarge the alliance, though in the same interview Gorbachev also stated that he thinks that enlargement was a “big mistake” and “a violation of the spirit of the statements and assurances made” in 1990.

Indeed, the only formal agreement signed between Nato countries and the USSR, before its breakup in December 1991, was the Treaty of Final Settlement with Respect to Germany. The promises made specifically relate to Germany, and the territory of the former GDR, which were on the deployment of non-German Nato forces into eastern Germany and the deployment of nuclear weapons – and these promises have been kept.

NATO did not "aggressively expand." Former republics in the USSR, etc., sought to join NATO of their own accord. They were invited to join NATO in 2002 and 2004, etc. Ukraine sought to join NATO as well. They have a right to join NATO if that is what they choose to do. They are a sovereign nation, not kindergarten children whose parents choose who they can play with.

Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, etc., all joined NATO and the EU because of the net benefit of belonging to Europe and NATO as a whole. The notion that Putin is invading Ukraine to create a buffer between him and NATO is facially absurd, since if he succeeds, he will have two problems he did not have before: 1) he will be occupying a country, supplied with arms from NATO, which will fight him tooth and nail 2) he will have no buffer zone since his border will be a border with NATO.

I know you come from the Ukraine, but are you Ukrainian or Russian? Do tell. I understand that there are Ukrainian Russians who sympathize with Russia and that there are Ukrainian Russians who don't. But Ukraine is not Russia, never has been, and never will be. Russia needs to go home before more of their kids are pushing up sunflowers in a foreign country.

Russia ceasing hostilities, removing their troops, and withdrawing their "recognition" of the separatist regions is the only way this goes well for everyone.

Thanks for the input on the Norwegian assessment, seems rather on-point.

I too think Putin has painted himself into a corner, although I think he can't even pull off the "lesson to Ukrainian rebels" convincingly even in Russia, no matter how much he might try to push that narrative through the media.

Right now if he retreats or concedes in any way on potential negotiations (ones in which Zelensky will not budge now that the rest of the world backs him), it's an embarassing defeat since everyone knows he wanted to obliterate the concept of Ukraine altogether. If Putin however goes all the way, it will isolate himself and Russia, leading the nation down the drain. Either way he loses, his reputation is now in the mud and I'm pretty sure this will be the beginning of the end of his reign.

Nāgārjuna identifies an opinion he does have, namely one: the indestructible (avipranaśa) of the Ārya-sammitiyas is his preferred conventional account of karma and its results. Other than that, he does not present opinions of his own at all in the MMK.

The point that you seem to miss is that when it is said by Nāgārjuna that he has no position, it means he makes no ontological claims with respect to existence and nonexistence, or specifically, svabhāva.

It does not mean he has no opinion with respect to the value of the Mahāyāna, medical care for the indigent, and so on, in other words, he may have positions regarding conventional things, but he neither defends nor advances positions regarding existence and nonexistence.

Bundokji said:
I guess the cold war was an attempt to prove that ideology can trump geography, but it failed. The spheres of influence that are emerging in the world seem to be more driven by geography. China's sphere of influence is the south China sea (and that includes the Philippines). Russia is trying to protect its sphere of influence. Iran's sphere of influence is the Persian gulf. Turkey, a major NATO country turned its back to Europe and is trying to join its natural sphere of influence in the south and the East.

On the other hand, western democracies (an ideology) deviate from this more-natural rule and are causing divisions. Europe is becoming more divided especially after Brexit, while anglo-saxons are trying to form alliances based on ethnicity and history such as US, Britain and AUS (they gave the middle finger recently to France over the submarines deal hence France is showing some sympathy to Russia according to Macron).

On the other tack, here's a thoughtful lecture from John Mearsheimer on the causes of this crisis, which he lays at the feet of the US.

Malcolm wrote:
Principally this is his point:

Q: Now Russia and China are cultivating a friendly relationship premised on the U.S. as their common enemy. Do you think Russia and China will be compatible in their stances toward Asia?

A: The U.S. has foolishly driven the Russians into the arms of the Chinese. I think Russia is the natural ally of the U.S. against China.

In 1969, the Soviet Union and China almost fought a war in Siberia. The Soviet Union and China -- and now we're talking about Russia and China -- have a history of bad relations, in large part because they share a border and each occupies big chunks of real estate in Asia. Russia should be an ally of the U.S. against China, and the U.S. needs all the allies it can get to contain China.

But what we have done by expanding NATO eastward is we have precipitated a huge crisis with Russia that prevents us from fully pivoting to Asia. We can't fully pivot to Asia because we're so concerned about events in Eastern Europe. That's the first consequence. The second is that we have driven the Russians into the arms of the Chinese. This makes no sense at all.

Q: The current tensions along the Ukraine border raise the question of whether the U.S. is capable of dealing with European and Asian issues simultaneously.

A: Let me chose my words carefully. The U.S. has the capability to deal with a conflict in Europe and a conflict in Asia at the same time.

However, it does not have the capability to perform well in both campaigns at the same time. By getting involved in a conflict in Eastern Europe, we, the U.S., are detracting from our ability to contain China and to fight a war against China, should one break out.

Well,  until you subject it to analysis, you won't know, will you? Since all cause and condition is determined by Nāgārjuna to be mere convention, statements like this, "any phenomenon exists only as part of the total nexus of reality" are subject to the analysis of one vs. many. As Śantirakṣita points out:

Because these entities asserted by ourselves (buddhists) and others (nonbuddhists) 
are in reality free from a nature 
of being one or many, 
they lack inherent existence, like a reflection.

This equally to proposed entities such as as a "total nexus of reality." You can say a car is a nexus of parts, but in reality you will not find a car in its parts, separate from its parts, nor in all of its part together. This claim above is the same: you can call all phenomena together reality, but you will not find reality in any one phenomena, separated from phenomena, or in all phenomena together. You will also be unable to find any phenomena which can support the existence of any other phenomena either alone or in concert. For example, a car cannot be supported on any of the phenomena which we assemble into a car, a car is merely conventional designation for a collection of parts which does not indicate anything real. As Nāgārjuna famously stated, "whatever arises in dependence, that is empty, that is dependently designated, and that is the middle way."

This way of dividing the two truths is inappropriate. If there is nothing to be empty, there also isn't emptiness. There is no ultimate apart from the ultimate nature of things. Gzhan stong suffers from the same realism that yogacāra does. They assert buddhas exist but sentient beings do not. In reality, neither sentient beings nor buddhas can every be established to exist inherently. That means both buddhas and sentient beings, samsara and nirvana, are relative and not ultimate.

This is a post I wrote some time ago, slightly corrected.

The very simplest method is the practice of the Pretamukha-agnijvālayaśarakāra-nāma-dhāraṇī:

Early in the day, but also at any other time: into a pure vessel which is completely clean without any remnents of any food at all, place water, and holding this in one's right hand recite the following dharani seven times:

Namaḥ sarvatathāgata avalokite oṃ saṃbhara saṃbhara hūṃ

Then recite the names of these Buddhas:

Homage to the Tathāgata Many Jewels [imagine all the pretas actions of avarice of many lifetimes are destroyed and they accumulate all merits].

Homage to the Tathāgata Sublime Form [Imagine all the pretas physical sufferings are conquered and they acheive perfect forms and characteristics].

Homage to the Tathāgata Endlessly Abundant Body [Imagine all the pretas thirst is given up and satisfied, and they are satisified with sufficient food].

Homage to the Tathā gata Free from Fear [Imagine all the pretas are free from all fears].

At the end of reciting these names, snap one's fingers three times, and pour the vessel's contents out onto clean ground.

Having done this, one will have pacified the realms of the pretas, and satisfied them, and so on.

This instruction on how to do the practice is extracted from the root text found in volume Wam of the bstan 'gyur.

Yep, everything is Russia's fault, especially Ukraine's endemic corruption. Then the broken infrastructure, the dysfunctional politics, etc etc. An anecdote. When I was in Kyiv in 1999, while the relations with Russia were still good, the street lights no longer worked in many places in the city. At the main railway station I saw a pensioner holding a placard advertising her apartment for an overnight stay. Making our way through the broken asphalt in the dark streets, I heard her voice trembling with fear for letting this stranger (me) into her apartment for the night, explaining that otherwise she would not be able to pay her utility bills. Many were begging in the streets, people who've worked their whole lives.

Malcolm wrote:
Dan. I am not going to argue with you about the material conditions in a country I have never visited.

But I also know other Ukrainians. One, a Russian-speaking Jew from Donetsk, left Ukraine and moved to Israel. In the middle of his rants about Soros, etc., he explained that he was afraid of the neo-nazis in the separatist regions——an entirely valid fear.

There is no doubt Ukraine has endemic corruption, after all, the previous pro-Russian regime hired Paul Manafort as their PR guy until the government fell after the protests. However, yes, it is Russia's fault, after all, Russia was its largest trading partner til 2014 and the annexation of Crimea.

But it isn't a failed state, not yet. For example, their bond rating was moved up from b- to b; it moved up seven positions in the 2020 World Bank report. But of course there are problems, like the Ukranian supreme court ruling anti-corruption measures unconstitutional, which then lead the IMF not to release loan money, etc.

Russia wants Ukraine for its natural resources. It's just a land grab.

Still a bit confused as well how the unborn, unbecome, etc is relative. I understand Aryadeva's comments, but reading the Nibbana Sutta with that understanding doesn't make sense. If the unborn is what frees us from the born how could they both be relative. A relative insight freeing us from conventional reality?

Not so. One cannot refute a person who has no thesis of their own. Nagarjuna’s sole concern is to point out deviations from dependent origination.

Depends on who you ask. Some say he negated literally everything, including himself (See Stafford L Betty, "Nagarjuna’s Masterpiece, Logical, Mystical, Both, or Neither?").

See Richard Robinson "Did Nagarjuna Really Refute All Philosphical Views?"

Malcolm wrote:
It doesn’t depend at all on which western philosopher one asks.

Every position refuted by Nagarjuna is a historical position held by one of his contemporaries, and no, you are incorrect, he rejected the assertions of others by pointing out the unintended consequences in their theses. There is no law requiring that erroneous assertions and arguments be given a “fair shake.”

Since all assertions depend on assertions of the existence and nonexistence of something, Nagarjuna shows two things: 1) the Buddha spoke intentionally of existence and nonexistence depending on the audience. 2) he reaffirmed the Buddha’s own observations that dependent origination was free of the extremes of existence and nonexistence in the face of mounting misunderstanding of the Buddha’s intent. That’s it.

My opinion is that war is, and should be viewed as a last resort and diplomacy should continue.

Brunelleschi said:
Perhaps there needs to be concessions. This is not ideal but it would most likely be vastly preferable to a military conflict.

Malcolm wrote:
No. The EU has no right to make "concessions" about another nation's boundaries to a foreign aggressor.

This is no different than Hitler's Sudetenland expansion in 1939.

The EU is looking a lot like Neville Chamberlain these days.

That's not the point. The point is that it is not a right wing opinion per se. In Europe right wingers save a few populists are pro-NATO, anti-Russia. The political scene is not the same as in the US.

If not, then the EU is going to have to stand up against Russia.

Dwayne Lich questions legality of Emergencies Act

He also questioned whether the Emergencies Act — which was debated Saturday in the House of Commons — was implemented legally, at times confusing the numbered amendments found in the U.S. Constitution with Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

"Honestly? I thought it was a peaceful protest and based on my first amendment, I thought that was part of our rights," he told the court.

"What do you mean, first amendment? What's that?" Judge Julie Bourgeois asked him.

"I don't know. I don't know politics. I don't know," he said. "I wasn't supportive of the blockade or the whatever, but I didn't realize that it was criminal to do what they were doing. I thought it was part of our freedoms to be able to do stuff like that."

That’s not exactly the “Tibetan view”, and there are all kinds of writings on karma across traditions, including Tibetan traditions, not all of which agree….what a surprise.

Shinjin said:
What is the "Tibetan view" and how does it differ accross traditions?

Malcolm wrote:
The "Tibetan" view is rooted in writings of Vasubandhu: the fourth chapter of Abhidharmakośabhaṣya and the Karmasiddhiprakarana.

It does not differ across Tibetan traditions. In other words, all the Tibetan schools pretty much follow the same playbook when it comes to explaining karma.

The "hijab/turban ban" isn't about race, it applies equally to all religious symbolism. Since Quebec often follows France in their sentiments, being a Francophone province, the "hijab/turban ban" is just an example of Quebec following the precedent of this law in France:

Quebec's legal system is based on the Napoleonic Code, like Louisiana.

President Vladimir V. Putin said he would decide by day’s end whether to recognize the independence of Luhansk and Donetsk. U.S. officials worry that Russia could use such a recognition to move more forces in.

So I’m asking this cause there seems (at least from my view) a particular barrier between the USA and Dharma.

Malcolm wrote:
Not really. Dharma is beyond culture. Buddhism, not necessarily.

Nadereme said:
I would say that this can be due to the extreme sort of Protestantism pervading the country. From fanatical Christians and Jews to fanatical secularists/atheists/agnostics/science/rationality folks. As well as all of the political discourse. Not to mention marketing catering and consumerism.

Malcolm wrote:
Fanaticism, politics, marketing, and consumerism have existed in Buddhism from the beginning as well.

Nadereme said:
I see it as extensions of perceived ‘righteousness’ where those who don’t follow along are simply bad, wrong, stupid, or evil. Does this present a unique challenge? And even when the Dharma is in the US, there tends to be a ‘Protestantizing’ of it seen through the secular and pragmatic movements a la Ingram, or through sectarianism and purism/triumphalism of literature and texts and practice and yanas.

Malcolm wrote:
So you just proved the point, these things have existed in Buddhism from the beginning.

In other words, what makes 'one' in 'one mind' is the essence, that is emptiness. Another term for it is self-nature (zixing 自性).

Malcolm wrote:
That makes everything more clear. Zixing is svabhāva; and if one defines svabhāva as emptiness, there is no problem. Of course there is only one dharmatā pervading all phenomena, whether conditioned or unconditioned.

If one isn’t clear what a term means, one cannot have a meaningful dialogue about it. Your examples don’t explain what you think the term means.

Does the capital letter make mind and self have more than four letters? Or does it somehow metaphysically transform the terms into something ultimate?

This is a post I wrote some time ago, slightly corrected.

The very simplest method is the practice of the Pretamukha-agnijvālayaśarakāra-nāma-dhāraṇī:

Early in the day, but also at any other time: into a pure vessel which is completely clean without any remnents of any food at all, place water, and holding this in one's right hand recite the following dharani seven times:

Namaḥ sarvatathāgata avalokite oṃ saṃbhara saṃbhara hūṃ

Then recite the names of these Buddhas:

Homage to the Tathāgata Many Jewels [imagine all the pretas actions of avarice of many lifetimes are destroyed and they accumulate all merits].

Homage to the Tathāgata Sublime Form [Imagine all the pretas physical sufferings are conquered and they acheive perfect forms and characteristics].

Homage to the Tathāgata Endlessly Abundant Body [Imagine all the pretas thirst is given up and satisfied, and they are satisified with sufficient food].

Homage to the Tathā gata Free from Fear [Imagine all the pretas are free from all fears].

At the end of reciting these names, snap one's fingers three times, and pour the vessel's contents out onto clean ground.

Having done this, one will have pacified the realms of the pretas, and satisfied them, and so on.

This instruction on how to do the practice is extracted from the root text found in volume Wam of the bstan 'gyur.

This practice is very powerful in removing provocations by non-human beings, is an extremely rapid way of reaching the end of the perfection of generosity, and so on. It requires no initiation of any kind. You can also skip reciting the Buddhas names.
