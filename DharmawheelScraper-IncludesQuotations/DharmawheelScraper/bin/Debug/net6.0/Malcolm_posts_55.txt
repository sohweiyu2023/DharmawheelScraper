China is suppressing Tibetan Buddhism along with Tibetans very harshly. In fact, virtually all Tibetans have all had their passports rescinded and are not allowed to travel out the PRC bloc, or even from province to province. Also China is interfering with the traditional nomadic culture of Tibet through resettlements. Lhasa is being dismantled house by house., etc.


Serenity509 said:
The United Nations is set to receive evidence that Chinese People’s Armed Police troops have repeatedly opened fire on unarmed Tibetan protesters calling for religious freedom over the past seven years.

Evidence of deadly attacks by the Chinese paramilitary on Buddhist demonstrators across the Tibetan Plateau – provided by witnesses, whistleblowers, and a secret government document smuggled out of Tibet – will be presented to the UN’s Committee against Torture later this year.

“The usage of live ammunition against peaceful Tibetan protestors does exist and it is also disproportionate,” Prime Minister Lobsang Sangay, the head of Tibet’s government-in-exile, told The Diplomat. “This is clearly in violation of international law,” said the prime minister, a former research fellow at prestigious Harvard Law School who wrote his graduate thesis on Buddhism and Human Rights.

Fantastic post.

Stupid question time, though. The term 'state' is used often in English language Dzogchen literature, especially in the DC. However there seems to me to be several meanings and interpretations of the word (same with 'condition') that have divergent consequences as to how the sentence should be understood. So how, precisely, are you using it here?
Bumping my question - answering it will be a massive help for me. This has always confused me...

In Tibetan, the word generally translated as "state" is ngang. This in turn has three interrelated meanings: 1) continuum [ rgyud ] or native place [ gshis ka ]; 2) nature [ rang bzhin ] or modality [rnam tshul]; 3) intrinsic power or effortless natural perfection ['bad med lhun sgrub].

I'm not a scholar, but here's a quote from Tulku Urgyen Rinpoche's "As It Is, Vol. I": By training thoroughly in this way, discursive thinking will gradually grow less and less, and moments of thoughtfree wakefulness will grow longer and longer. When this nonconceptual wakefulness lasts one hour, you have attained the level of an arhat. When it lasts throughout the day, you have attained the level of a bodhisattva. When it is uninterrupted day and night, you have become a fully enlightened buddha. There is nothing more precious than this.

zenman said:
Interesting quote, especially because it mentions the requirement of an arhat which is hinayana directly compared to mahayana- and vajrayana-attainments. I understand Tulku Urgyen was a great master but I wonder if this is actually so. This is in fact what I was after with my former question reg. 24/7 awareness vs. fully enlightened buddhahood. I have come across a few people who say that their awareness is uninterrupted day and night and has been for many years. And it seemed to me that it might actually be so without any "specialty" or egoism to them. I thought 24/7 was what arhats are in. I think this is a wonderful degree of attainment but surely anyone I have met saying this can't stick their hand into fire without getting hurt. That's why I was asking Malcolm for the quote, to get a reliable source or sources on this exact issue.

Malcolm wrote:
Everyone's awareness is 24/7/365 for eons and eons. But not everyone's knowledge of their primordial state is 24/7/365. Those whose knowledge of their primordial state is 24/7/365 are Buddhas.

steve_bakr said:
Keep us posted on your forthcoming book. I hope it is available in Kindle format.

Malcolm wrote:
At this point, we are not doing an electronic edition.

The very short explanation is, according to the upadesha class tantras such as the root tantra of Dzogchen, sgra thal gyur, that there is a neutral awareness [ shes pa ] that arises out of the basis because of a stirring of vāyu [ rlung ], sometimes mistranslated as prāṇa ( prāṇa is a vāyu ). Because there is a movement, accompanied by sound [ sgra ], lights [ 'od ] and rays [ zer ]*, there are appearances that arise out of the basis. When these appearances are recognized as one's own state, this recognition is what is called " rig pa ", it is also given the name " shes rab " or prājña. When these appearances are not recognized as one's own state, this is called " ma rig pa ", avidyā.

It is for this reason, for example, that the famous Aspiration of Buddha Samantabhadra begins:
All of the universe and beings, samsara and nirvana
have one basis. The two paths and two results
are the enchantments of knowledge [rig pa] and ignorance [ma rig pa].
The two paths are the path to buddhahood, which is based on rig pa; and the path of the six realms which is based on ma rig pa.

Futher, we can see that vidyā, rig pa comes from the basis, but it is not the basis:
Vidyā self-originates from that basis itself
without bearing the faults of external and internal reification,
free from the tainted darkness of amnesia,
therefore, it self-appears unaffected by faults.
Rig pa self originates from the basis because rig pa is just the recognition of the basis as one's own state itself. It self-originates because you did not receive this knowledge from someone else, you must recognize it in a direct perception called the direct perception of dharmatā, your real nature. The so-called "direct introduction" is mere a method to introduce you to "your own face." This is one reason why the metaphor of the mirror is so important in Dzogchen teachings. This rig pa, this true knowledge of one's own state, is therefore unaffected by subject and object dualism; is free from non-recollection, because once you have this unmistaken knowledge, i.e., vidyā, you will never forget it, and therefore, vidyā is unaffected by any faults whatsoever.

However western translators may translate these terms, what they mean in Tibetan is very precise, and between Chos and Bon, have exactly the same meaning.

You can see again in this following passage that shes pa, awareness, and knowledge, rig pa, vidyā, are used in two different ways:
One’s vidyā [rig pa, knowledge of the basis] abides in a pristine state,
not terrified by the terrors of the three realms,
not attached to sensuous qualities. 
Physical form and color do not exist
in self-originated nonconceptual awareness [shes pa].
One's vidya, rigpa, knowledge, abides in a pristine state because there are no physical forms and colors in consciousness; rig pa is the knowledge that the appearances of the five lights and so on in one's fundamental unfabricated consciousness are not substantial or real. They are merely the energy of the basis, from which that awareness is inseparable.

When this knowledge does not arise, then as the Aspiration of Samantbhadra states:
First, since vidyā/rig pa did not arise in the basis 
deluded sentient beings
cannot recall anything and are confused.
The cause of that is the delusion of ignorance.
Within that is a sudden unconsciousness
in which a fearful awareness stirs without clarity, 
Within that self and other are perceived as enemies. 
From the gradual buildup of traces, 
entry into the process of samsara happens.
If vidyā is the basis, then there is no way anyone could ever be deluded, samsara would never have happened. Indeed, there is popular strand of misconception in Dzogchen that claims that samsara never did happen. While this is true from the point of view of Samantabhadra [and hence the rhetoric of the sems sde literature], this is not true from our point of view, since we are continuing in samsara and gather karma and building up traces. If we are in the state of knowledge that is the state of Samantabhadra, then for us samsara will gave never happened. But until we are in that knowledge 24/7/365 and therefore totally beyond time, then we are still in samsara.

Since vidyā is not the basis, by mistaking the nature of the sounds, lights and rays that come from the basis for being dualistic phenomena, one is trapped by avidyā, ma rig pa and one cycles endlessly in the three realms. Dzogchen practice is the means the reverse this error because the basis of knowledge and ignorance is the same, and knowledge and ignorance arise on the basis of an awareness [shes pa] that exists as part of the basis.

My book expends a little energy in explaining these critical points in an introduction, but my explanation is not novel nor is it my own. I merely follow an outline that is common in both Chos and Bon Dzogchen teachings, and I use many citations from untranslated commentaries of Vimalamitra on the 17 Dzogchen tantras to illustrate my points. The only novel thing in my explanation is that I show the link between the initial shes pa, awareness or fundamental consciousness that arises from the basis, how that becomes pristine consciousness [ ye shes ] when in the presence of rig pa or knowledge of its own state; and how it becomes yid kyi rnam shes or "mental consciousness" and mind [ sems ] when it does not recognize its own state and engages in the dualistic imputations of because of ignorance [ ma rig pa ]. But even here, I do so on the basis of citations and reasonings drawn from classic commentaries, and I cannot claim any of these ideas as novel or as being my own.

* The principle of sounds, lights and rays is more fully explained in the Zhang Zhung sNyan brGyud of Bon; in Chos, it is mainly confined to describing the experience of the bardo of dharmatā.

Title: The Point of No Return: Climate Change Nightmares Are Alread
Content:
Unknown said:
Evidence for the above scenario comes in large part from our best understanding of what happened 250 million years ago, during the "Great Dying," when more than 90 percent of all oceanic species perished after a pulse of carbon dioxide and methane from land-based sources began a period of profound climate change. The conditions that triggered "Great Dying" took hundreds of thousands of years to develop. But humans have been emitting carbon dioxide at a much quicker rate, so the current mass extinction only took 100 years or so to kick-start.

With all these stressors working against it, a hypoxic feedback loop could wind up destroying some of the oceans' most species-rich ecosystems within our lifetime. A recent study by Sarah Moffitt of the University of California-Davis said it could take the ocean thousands of years to recover. "Looking forward for my kid, people in the future are not going to have the same ocean that I have today," Moffitt said.

Malcolm: The "Old Tibetan Chronicles" is a fairly mythic account of the founding of the Tibetan Empire. What you seem to be referring to are the "Old Tibetan Annals", a year-by-year, fairly bare-bones account of what the court was up to. And, by the way, there is lots of external evidence against which Chinese testimony for the period can be and has been checked. Again, we cannot say that Buddhism was mostly Chinese until 780, and leave it at that, because (among other reasons)much of the remaining temple art from the very earliest temples reflects Central Asian and Kashmiri rather than Chinese styles.

Malcolm wrote:
http://otdo.aa.tufs.ac.jp/index.cgi?page=History.

Buddhism went through three phases in Tibet: the earliest period which began in the reign of Srongtsan Gampo. Buddhism was suppressed following his death; and revived again during the reign of Me Agtsom, with largely Chinese influences at the court.

A contingent of Khotanese monks indeed fled to Tibet in 740, but shortly thereafter left for Gandhara following a small pox epidemic.

Later, during the reign of Trisong Detsen, Tibet dominated all of Central Asia, Kashimir, Gilgit and so on. It is not surprising then that Tibetans have art and stylistic influences from Khotan, also they invaded it and controlled it, and we know that the monastic hierarchy of Tibetan monasteries was derived form Central Asia.

Still, epigraphically, there is very little mention of an intellectual presence of Central Asian monks. It seems, when you read Tibetan historical works on the period, the dominant external Buddhist influences were Chinese and Indian, with Indian Buddhism eventually supplanting Chinese Buddhism.

Now, rig pa can, in certain contexts, be translated as awareness, but not universally, and not in this context.

Rig pa, vidyā, knowledge, is paired against ma rig pa, avidyā, ignorance. Knowledge or ignorance of what? One's own nature, the basis, essence, nature and compassion/energy.

I am a tiny bit uncomfortable here with the word "consciousness" out of the fear of introducing subcategories such as "subconscious" or "unconscious." Honestly, the other poster is correct in prefering "awareness" to "consciousness" because all the Dzogchen literature and texts that I have seen use "awareness," specifically "Intrinsic Awareness." The word "intrinsic" signifies that awareness is intrinsic to mind; that is, awareness is the nature of mind.

Malcolm wrote:
This is because of the allergy people have to the word "consciousness", it is not a justifiable translation based on the term "consciousness" by itself.

There are a range of words in Tibetan that use the particle "shes pa" such as rnam shes, ye shes, shes rab, shes pa itself, and so on. They all refer to modes of consciousness. Rig pa refers to what that consciousness knows. Pristine consciousness [ ye shes ] is one thing, our ordinary state of consciousness [ rnam shes ] something else — but they both have the same basis, shes pa.

Dzogchen terminology for these things is a very sophisticated psychology of delusion and liberation, but unfortunately, it has been obscured by translations that are not precise and clear.

Well, China is not the navel of the world.

Your argument runs as follows, "The Chinese did write about it, therefore it did not exist."

Tibet was of interest to China solely because Tibetans threatened their interests on the Silk Road. Other than that, China had no interest in the Tibetans, this, more than anything else, explains the lack of mention of Tibetan in Chinese annals.

This is not the case with "Khotan, Samarkand, Koguryo, Japan and SE Asian nations..." where China had active trade interests.

In the case of Tibet, I've looked at the Tang Chinese account of it in two fascicles (fairly lengthy, which highlights how important Tibet was to the Tang history).

There were plenty of envoys going to Tibet from China, but there's no real mention of a Buddhist institution in Yarlung Tibet. They mention a lot of blood sacrifices being done to seal oaths. So, how does that fit with the traditional Tibet narratives (especially later on when Yarlung kings are retroactively made Buddhist kings)?

They have been described also in several books, like one by Tenzin Wangyal Rinpoche and Lopon Tenzin Namdak. I don't see any reason why gazing could not be taught to anyone and tried, or how this could become a problem or create obstacles. However I think it requires calmness (shamatta).

Anyone can write a nice book about Dzogchen — its words are very easy to understand and fun to repeat. But there is a difference between a Dzogchen master like Chogyal Namkhai Norbu and someone like Jax. You can observe this in their conduct and activity. CHNN never expresses anything but respect for his own teachers and others. Jax puts himself on a pedestal and likes to criticize people who he has taken teachings from without cause.

I'm not saying this is necessarily correct, but the Chinese never heard of Tibetans until the seventh century basically, and they had reliable records going back to the Han dynasty. The peoples in what is now Tibet (especially Amdo it seems) were often known as  Qiang 羌.

The idea that the Tibetans descend from Qiang people who fled to Tibet has refuted by a number of Tibetan historians, many inconsistencies with this theory.

Yes, the Tibetan script is based on a Sanskrit script. There were many Sanskrit scripts. The earliest two were Kharoshthi and Brahmi:

Malcolm wrote:
The Bonpos assert that Tibetan script is derived from Zhang zhung smar script, from around 100 BCE. Given that Tibetans engaged on one of the most amazing cultural self-immolations during the 9th century, and given considerable evidence that Tibetans were familiar with writing prior the 7th century based on their being a vassal state of Zhang Zhung, disregarding for a moment the origin of Zhang Zhung smar script, the Tibetans certainly knew what writing was at a very early date.

The idea that Thonmi Sambhota "invented" Tibetan writing is an error. He adapted an earlier system based on his exposure to Sanskrit. It is likely therefore that while in general Bhrami must have formed the basis for all scripts in Zhang Zhung and Tibet, it is very hasty to claim that writing did not exist in Tibet prior to the 7th century, especially given the clear accounts of the books of Bonpos being burned by Buddhists during the late eighth century from both sides.

You very carefully did not answer my question. So let's try this again.

So are you saying that an affliction, such as anger, can be indulged/acted upon on the level of affliction and call it Vajrayana?
It has to be experienced in order to be addressed. It has to be allowed to arise, be seen and recognized.
Right. And if at that point it is not transmuted into enlightened wisdom, and remains an affliction, is that Vajrayana practice or is that samsaric activity?

Malcolm wrote:
You are really missing the point. When you observe anger arise in your mind, as a Vajrayāna practitioner, this is understood to be wisdom. It is not "turned" into wisdom, it always was. Such afflictions are poison because they are not recognized — when they are recognized, they have no power, and therefore, one does not act in ways that produce karma. This Vajrayāna method is very indirect, because it requires a lot of conceptual effort, but in principle it is the same as the the idea of liberation through recognition in Dzogchen.

For example, you become angry, but if you are a Vajrayāna practitioner, you cannot be angry at your own mandala, so when you apply the practice "all appearances are the deity" this cuts the force of anger.

If you are an advanced practitioner and are capable of transmuting an affliction into wisdom--which is an extraordinary accomplishment--then you can get near the affliction.

Have some difficulties to understand her Pristine Consciousness.
Thought that Wisdom self emanating is and so i don't see a relation with Consciousness.
- Could you maybe translate this Pristine Consciousness in Tibetan / Sanskrit?

Malcolm wrote:
ye shes = pristine [ye] consciousness [shes].

Wisdom, in English, does not really accurately translate ye shes. In English, wisdom means sagacity, intelligence, sense, common sense, shrewdness, astuteness, smartness, judiciousness, judgment, prudence, circumspection; logic, rationale, rationality, soundness, advisability. ANTONYMS folly, stupidity. as well as knowledge, learning, erudition, sophistication, scholarship, philosophy; lore.

Consciousness means the state of being awake and aware of one's surroundings, the awareness or perception of something by a person; the fact of awareness by the mind of itself and the world: consciousness emerges from the operations of the brain.

Now, there is in English no word that genuinely captures the sense of the term ye shes. And the sense of ye shes has gone beyond the Sanskrit term jñāna, at least in Dzogchen texts.

Ye shes is not inert, it is conscious; but it is not a conceptual or dualistic consciousness, it is therefore pristine.

One has to very precise, because different Dzogchen texts say different things depending on context.

The problem is that some people attempt to explain Dzogchen without understanding the principle of different texts and series, and so make a sort of stew of things.

Another problem is the modern intellectual fad of considering the bodhicitta texts such as five earlier lungs translated by Vairocana to be the "authentic original" or "radical" Dzogchen.

Someone who is confused about this, and has been confused about it for a long time, and has trotted his confusion out as though it's a pedigree in the public square, is rather clearly not an authentic teacher.


Malcolm wrote:
The problem here is mostly around definitions.

What is meant by "mind"? What is meant by "awareness?" What is meant by "wisdom."

One can certainly find many Dzogchen texts that assert mind and wisdom are mutually exclusive. For example, one of the texts in the Pellucid Transcendent State of Samantabhadra cycle declares:
The general dharma systems assert buddhahood for the mind. The system of the Pellucid Transcendent State of the Great Perfection does not assert buddhahood in the mind. The mind is the basis of accumulating various traces. Buddhahood is self-originate pristine consciousness [rang byung ye shes] that is free from thought. There is no place for traces to accumulate in the pristine consciousness that is free from thought.
It then cites a text called Molten Silver:
Observe the mind with the mind, there isn’t anything to see;
likewise, even though the nature of the mind is understood to be empty, this is not buddhahood;
that removes afflictions, but does not increase wisdom.
Hoping for buddhahood in the mind is like a feather being carried by the wind.
It finally distinguishes that mind and pristine consciousness [ ye shes ] have different results:
The results are not the same: the mind is mounted on the vāyu, and the mental concepts of the merged vāyu and mind move wildly. An undercurrent of concepts arise, accumulating as an undercurrent of traces. The present cause of birth in samsara is always engaging in the dualism of an apprehended object and an apprehending subject through combining both mind and the breath. Since one possesses a mind of an apprehended object and an apprehending subject, concepts arise in the mind. Since various concepts proliferate, temporary concepts arose. Since the five poisonous afflictions arose in the mind, they increased to eighty-four thousand. Since concepts proliferate in the mind, in every instant of time, one hundred concepts arise and on hundred cease. Therefore, the wheel of suffering is uninterrupted. The result is the ripening of the three lower realms.

Pristine consciousness self-originates from the beginning, is without breath, is pellucid, free from the mind, limpidly clear, non-conceptual and completely blissful. Since it is without arising and ceasing, it does not move. Clear in uniformity, unchanging and uninterrupted, clarity and non-conceptuality, bliss and emptiness are the same. The result is self-appearing perfect buddhahood.
So, one needs to be careful.

Now that you mention these, I recall reading about them, but I am curious as to whether most Tibetan masters in history were aware of the direct correspondence between the violence described in Vajrayāna texts and the real life violence between Brahmanical and Buddhist societies.

Oh, absolutely, it is major theme in all lineages histories of the siddhas.

The explanation of the symbolic import of abhicarya rites and so on was confined to mundane practitioners who had not achieved siddhi.
So that leads to the question: how many people were aware of the non-symbolic import of abhicāra rites?

Malcolm wrote:
Pretty much everyone in Tibet, including common people. I mean look, just examine the bio of Milarepa — what was he famous for? Rites for summoning hail connected with the planetary god, Rahula. Everyone in Tibet knows this, it is part of the common culture.

Wrathful rituals to dispatch demons as well as enemies are part and parcel of Tibetan religious life. There was a whole class of ritualists called Sogdogpas whose main job was ritually repelling Mongolians.

Rites known as Zor, which translates to something in modern parlance like "magical bomb," but literally means "sickle" or "scythe", are very popular. They are popular because people believe they work.

There is for example in Gelug history, the example of using abhicara rites to kill one of the Karmapas before he had a chance to reach the Chinese emperor.  A famed Gelug master was concerned that if the Karmapa as allowed to reach the Qing emperor,, things would be bad for the fortune of the Gelug school. 

There is much less erotica in Tibetan Vajrayāna than its Indian forbear, because the Tibetans were rather prudish, but have a rather violent character and are pretty war-like. They have just sublimated most of their aggression into religious and business pursuits, and they are self-consciously aware of this to a high degree.

Yes, there is the rnam thar of Virupa, which while committed to writing in the late 12th century, certainly was communicated orally from the mid 11th.

Also the 12th century bio of Padmasambhava reports a great deal of hostility between Hindus and Buddhists, and the stories of the 84 mahāsiddhas are full of magical battles between Hindus and Buddhists. There is even the 13th century confrontation between Harananda and Sakya Pandita. In short, Tibetans knew very well that India was a hostile place for Buddhists, which is why they largely ceased going there for anything other than trade purposes by the 13th century. They also received regular reports of Hindu hostilities from refugee Indian Buddhists who frequently took refuge in Tibet as late as the 15th century.

Verardi's argument is that the symbolism of violence in the tantric materials is not strictly symbolic: it actually reflects real life violence as a reaction to centuries of antagonistic and hostile Brahmanism. It seems when the Tibetans inherited these practices, the historical background and context behind them were not really understood, which is also why modern teachers likewise would interpret things as being entirely symbolic.

However, the criteria for being able to engage of rites of liberation on more than a symbolic level requires that the practitioner be a siddhi in fact. You should examine the story of Virupa, as his tale has the largest number of hostile and violent interactions with Hindus.

From another thread. Garching R. weighs in on the definition of "non-dual".

Garchin R. said:
Those who understand the view of non-duality, that self and others are not separate, can practice the Dharmakaya Phowa. The Dharmakaya Phowa is very powerful. Those who do not understand the non-duality of self and others should practice the Phowa of compassion - the Samboghakaya and Nirmanakaya Phowa. So those who perceive a duality of self and others, who think that we are separate from each other, should practice the Samboghakaya or Nirmanakaya Phowa - the Phowa of compassion. Those who understand that a duality of self and others does not exist within the mind, can practice the Dharmakaya Phowa. Because they have given rise to compassion, they have love; and because they have realized emptiness, they know that a duality of self and others does not exist. Therefore, they are able to destroy the self-grasping in the minds of others. This is the supreme Phowa

smcj said:
(formatting mine)

How does that square with Madhyamaka?

Malcolm wrote:
In Madhyamaka, ultimately there is no duality because neither existence nor nonexistence, self and other, etc. is established in the ultimate.

However, the final statement, "they are able to destroy the self-grasping in the minds of others"  is not consistent with the premise, "because they have realized emptiness, they know that a duality of self and others does not exist."

Further, there is the added problem — Buddhas have realized everything to realize, and have abandoned everything to abandon, they have perfect compassion which is unlimited. For what reason then have they not destroyed self-grasping that exists in the mind of all sentient beings? Therefore, I don't think that this statement above can be taken seriously. It also contradicts the statement of the Buddha:
Misdeeds cannot be washed away by water,
the suffering of living beings cannot be removed with the hand,
my realization cannot transferred to another,
but by showing the true nature of things, there will be liberation.

This study shows that “sea ice thickness, like extent, is highly variable,” he says. “Now, we’ve already known that it’s highly variable … So it’s really not saying anything new there.” He also has some concerns about the basic methods the researchers used to compute changes in sea ice volume, arguing that they made some “suspect assumptions” about certain important factors that could affect their calculations, like the thickness of snow cover on the ice.

My understanding is that Vajradhara is understood to be the enlightenment of Sakyamuni as seen from the Vajrayana perspective. So that's why at the very top of the Kagyu Refuge tree is a small Vajradhara, representing Sakyamuni. Then you also visualize your own teacher as Vajradhara, not because he is in any sense the same personage as Sakyamuni, but the enlightenment presented to you by him is still the enlightenment of Sakyamuni as has been passed down through the lineage(s).

This is not how things are presented in Dzogchen, or for that matter in Sakya or Nyingma. In both Sakya and Nyingma for example, the nirmanakāya is not considered to be the "Teacher". There is only one teacher, Buddha Samantabhadhra/Vajradhara. This single teacher, the dharmakāya, called Samantabhadra, emanates the Samabhogakāya, in this case Vajradhara, who in turn emanates the nirmanakāyas such as Śākyamuni. I am fairly certain the Kagyus also present things in this way.

I suppose it's better to ask what remains relevant to the needs of ordinary people in Japanese Buddhist traditions.  I'll argue that they offer a means to liberation from the suffering and struggle of everyday life on ordinary terms.  How this interfaces with contemporary Japanese social life and institutions, the substrate upon which these traditions depend for their continued existence, is a separate matter and I don't know how to address it.

I'm more or less taking what your arguing implicitly to suggest, there are myriads of people whose understanding of the world around them do not coincide with the "Indo-centric" views, or more expansively, the ideas of the substance of matter (being composed of 4 or 5 elements), for example, or the construction of people as 5 aggregates, and yet, I don't accept that they are precluded from Buddhist attainment because they don't adopt these subjective views.

Malcolm wrote:
If you don't understand the five aggregates, you will never attain buddhahood. Why? Because you will never understand what absence of self really means in any concrete way.

The four or five elements are phenomenological descriptions of matter (hardness, liquidity, heat, motility and absence of obstruction), they are not considered things in themselves, at least, not in Yogacara on up.

If you do not understand the five elements, you will not understand the meaning of rūpaskandha.

Myriads of people do not attain buddhahood.

The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, brings new importance to a feedback loop in the ocean near Antarctica that results in cooler freshwater from melting glaciers forcing warmer, saltier water underneath the ice sheets, speeding up the melting rate.

Everyone is a tulku. From my blog:

Karma Dondrup Tashi said:
The purpose of this post is to settle a controversy [and perhaps create another] and remove a misunderstanding about so called "sprul skus" or reincarnations, that venerable institution that causes so much controversy in Tibetan Buddhism.

In the teaching of the Great Perfection there are two kinds of so called nirmanakāyas or tulkus. First, there are impure forward-progression [ma dag pa lugs 'byung] nirmanakāyas  i.e. all sentient beings. These arise because of ignorance.

The second are pure reverse-progression [dag pa lugs ldog] nirmanakāyas: among these there are also two, those that come from the dharmakāya and sambhogakāya, nirmanākāyas of compassion if you will. The second are called nirmanakāyas of the attained result, these are sentient beings of pure karma, blessed by being seen by the buddhas, who make more and more progress, attaining higher and higher states of yogic understanding.

Thus we sentient beings are all nirmanakāyas -- differentiated only by our level of relative attainment and relative level of pure and impure karma.

The so-called "tulkus" of institutional Tibetan Buddhism are also sentient beings; some with higher yogic attainments, some with none, and others with some. Because they are sentient beings, some remember their rebirths well, and others not at all. Some achieve high levels of yogic understanding, some are great teachers, some are panditas, poets and artists. Some tulkus are mere politicians, some are gangsters, some are thieves. But they are all sentient beings. Not one of them was not born from the womb of a human mother.

Most tulkus are never "recognized" because anyone who practices Dharma sincerely is a tulku, no matter what level of "realization" they are reputed to have, whether or not they have been recognized. In this sense, a tulku is defined as someone who acts to help sentient beings inspired by the compassion of the buddhas for sentient beings.

We are all rinpoches, precious ones. Sentient beings are precious because their plight is the cause of the compassion of the buddhas. Buddhas are precious because they exist solely to aid sentient beings from suffering. I guess you could say it is rinpoches all the way down.

Some people crave recognition, wanting others to acknowledge their status -- consider yourselves acknowledged  but don't expect a title. If you want people to consider you a tulku, act like one. If you must, fake it. Faking it may even lead to developing some real compassion which exceeds your petty narrow-minded grasping to titles and position. Being a pure reverse-progression tulku means cherishing all sentient beings. Nothing is holding you back but your own selfishness.

The Dzogchen teachings acknowledge that all sentient beings are tulkus. But whether that is meaningful is not up to the buddhas, it is up to each one of us and our dedication to the path of awakening and benefitting our fellow tulkus.

In reality, tulkuhood is defined not by robes, titles, race, position, gender, education, or creed but by how we are able to apply wisdom and compassion in our efforts to aid sentient beings and alleviate their suffering.

The Buddha taught three paths: the path of renunciation which is common to Hinayāna and Mahāyāna; the path of transformation which is general Vajrayāna and the path of self-liberation, which is also termed Atiyoga.

The principles of the higher paths often seem to contradict the principles of the lower paths, but in reality, they are all aiming at the same point, buddhahood. If someone does not have faith in a path, for example, karmamudra, they should leave it aside and not criticize it, because many masters in India and Tibet have attained complete buddhahood through practicing this path. One should be careful not to criticize Vajrayāna teachings, because one will abandon the Dharma if one does so.

Lord, you will serve beings in India for (the next) thirteen lives,
After that, in the region of Lungmar of Lhotrag,
You will take birth as Nima Ozer, a master of kama and terma teachings

rgya mtsho bu ba is defined in Tibetan materia medica as an earth and stone medicine. However, it is indeed cuttlefish bone that is wild crafted from beaches.

The main problem with offering incense to Nagas is that most Tibetan incense contains musk, and other animal products. But since this is a sea product, I don't think there is an issue, especially if you get it from a traditional source where it is beach harvested, rather than a fishing byproduct. It is used for kidney heat and illnesses of the brain.

This year celebrates the 200th aniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin, best known for his theory of evolution summarized in On the Origin of Species. Less well known is that, in the second half of his life, Darwin’s major scientific focus turned towards plants. He wrote several books on plants, the next-to-last of which, The Power of Movement of Plants, published together with his son Francis, opened plants to a new view. Here we amplify the final sentence of this book in which the Darwins proposed that: “It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the tip of the radicle thus endowed [with sensitivity] and having the power of directing the movements of the adjoining parts, acts like the brain of one of the lower animals; the brain being seated within the anterior end of the body, receiving impressions from the sense-organs, and directing the several movements.” This sentence conveys two important messages: first, that the root apex may be considered to be a ‘brain-like’ organ endowed with a sensitivity which controls its navigation through soil; second, that the root apex represents the anterior end of the plant body. In this article, we discuss both these statements.

Dr. Freya Reeves Lambides, Editor
Avalon to Camelot Dear Dr. Lambides,
My previous letter [Vol. 1 No. 4, p. 2] was hastily written, without the thought that it would be published. Of course my use of the term "fascism” was imprecise. The lesson, I suppose, is that one should not write anything one would not care to see in print.

However, I will stand on and even expand my indictment of chivalric literature, in which I have such illustrious predecessors as Petrarch and Cervantes. Chivalric literature has been predominantly deceptive; that is, it has attempted to mislead readers or listeners about historical truth. It has encouraged bloodshed for the sake of principle, and discouraged learning and study. It also promoted an immature concept of the relations between the sexes, and was, if not openly anti-Semitic (there is a famous example of the latter in the Cid), at least quite in harmony with the birth of modern anti-Semitism in the late Middle Ages.

Of course there are works which are exempt from some or all of the charges. Obviously the literature would not have been written or read if some desire for it were not there; however, to exonerate the literature on these grounds is the same as exonerating handguns with the argument “guns don’t kill people, people kill people.” Of our postwar presidents it was the most aggressive, who laid the foundation for the Vietnam War, with whom chivalry is most closely associated. The role of southern chivalry, derived from the neo-Arthurianism of Sir Walter Scott, in setting the scene for the Civil War was pointed out a century ago; nothing in southern chivalry was found incompatible with slavery. According to its constitution, the Ku Klux Klan embodies in its principles “all that is chivalric in conduct” (Stanley Frost, The Challenge of the Klan [1924; rpt. New York: AMS, 1969], p. 68).

I do, then, object to the glamorization and popularization of chivalric literature, and to the eager interest in those seemingly central questions, the existence of a historical Arthur and the origin of the grail legend. It is not that the investigation is wrong in itself (though it says something about us that chivalry is today the most popular aspect of the medieval world), but the motivation behind it is, on the whole, misguided. Chivalric literature, like all myths, should be studied, but not taught.

You have said you are not certain that Return to Camelot makes the case I imply. I will quote only one sentence from the opening paragraph of the final chapter, “The Great War”: “ One conclusion is undeniable: the ideals of chivalry worked with one accord in favor of war ” (p. 276).
Just as you found part of my letter hard to understand, one sentence in your answer is unclear to me. Who are the “beings like Merlin who transcend our known realities”? If you maintain that there are unknown realities, then you have left scholarship, and me, behind.
Sincerely,
Daniel Eisenberg

Urgyen Dorje said:
But the truth is that for a Westerner to practice a teaching that comes from Tibet there is no need for that person to become like a Tibetan. On the contrary, it is of fundamental importance for him to know how to integrate that teaching with his own culture in order to be able to communicate it, in its essential form, to other Westerners. But often, when people approach an Eastern teaching, they believe that their own culture is of no value. This attitude is very mistaken, because every culture has its value, related to the environment ment and circumstances in which it arose. No culture can be said to be better than another; rather it depends on the human individual whether he or she will derive greater or lesser advantage from it in terms of inner development. For this reason it is useless to transport rules and customs into a cultural environment different from the one in which they arose.

Of course we have to understand that the practice of recognizing tulkus began with the second and third Karmapa, and these masters were fantastic. Then it became a big fashion, and within 200 hundred years, tulkus were being recognized everywhere.

We also should understand that the 5th Dalai Lama's recognition, by his own account, was completely fraudulent. He was also a fantastic master, but he certainly was not the reincarnation of the fourth Dalai Lama.

But I guess in times where it costs thousands and thousands of dollars to  do long term retreat, I doubt that we will get many realized practitioners from the pool of people more seriously interested in Tibetan buddhism. Because people interested in it can't afford the retreat time and most people these days are no longer hardy enough to live in a cave off nettles (and a lifestyle like that is forbidden in a lot of places anyway, try that in the Alps and you get arrested)

Malcolm wrote:
The idea that you have to live this hardcore ascetic lifestyle to become a realized person is a myth. You do not need to spend years and years in retreat. I know many people who have spend years and years in retreat and they are just as screwed up now as when they went into retreat, and just as ordinary. I also have done long term intensive retreat (3+ years), and while it was an awesome experience, I certainly did not come out of it a realized person. At least according to my master, there is no need for this. As long as one applies the the teachings in a consistent way to one's life, integrating view, meditation and conduct,  then one will eventually attain realization. Anyway, most of us will attain realization in the bardo, not in this life.

So certain problems within the tulku system have been present for centuries, but there have been a lot of cases where it worked just fine. Teachers like Dzongsar Khyentse are proof for that.


Malcolm wrote:
Apparently you did not read my posts carefully. In any event, the true recognition of tulkus depends on realized masters. Even then we have travesties such as Steven Segal and so on.

The system is broken, irreparably. This does not mean that there are no realized masters recognizing proper candidates, but in general, most people recognized as tulkus, even by this or that high lama, are not really reincarnations.

There is a story told about Khyentse Wangpo. Some monks were seeking the reincarnation of their lama, and they went to him, he recognized this boy as a reincarnation, but the boy proved to be rather ordinary. They went back to Khentse Wangpo to express their doubt. He became a little annoyed, and said, "Do you want to find the real incarnation of your master."

The monks all very eagerly agreed. Khyentse told them, "Go out behind the barn and call your master's name."

They did so, and young bull calf broke away from his mother to come and greet them.

Part of the reason why the tulku system is broken is because of the expectations of average Tibetans who won't donate to monasteries that have no reincarnations.

Adzom Drugpa's life was constantly in danger when he was a boy because of his recognition, and ChNN was poisoned as a young age because he was recognized as Zhabdrung Ngagwang Namgyal's incarnation.

No one denies that there have been exemplary reincarnations who have been great masters. There have also been many more great masters who were not tulkus (thank goodness), such as Ngala Changchub Dorje, Thangton Gyalpo, etc., the list is very long.

In my personal experience, there definitely are Tulkus. I am not saying I'm one, but I have known a number very closely, including my son. I have known some when they were very young and still remembered their past life. I have known others who have lost those memories. I have known Tibetan Tulkus and American Tulkus. One of these American Tulkus is one of the best examples I know of a real Tulku with the knowledge and ability to back up His "pedigree." I have been involved in the search for my own Root Guru's reincarnation, and I can tell you that, up to the point I was involved, it was far from frivolous and was completely apolitical. It was also guided by two very highly practiced and developed Teachers Whose siddhi and sincerity I trust implicitly. I feel quite confident that some highly realized Lamas can identify Tulkus, know where They have been born and Who They currently are. I also am quite sure there are false Tulkus recognized only for political/financial reasons. I've known Tulkus Who were brought up inside the monastic institutions and Tulkus Whose parents chose not to go that route. I've known good and not so good Tulkus.

Why am I saying this? To say the whole system is bogus is, in my experience, incorrect. If ChNN and His Son are both genuine Tulkus, They Themselves prove the system is not bogus. To say the system is broken is also probably not incorrect. To say that the whole system should be abandoned A) is not gonna happen any time soon, and B) I think it is throwing out the baby with the bathwater. Young Tulkus Who are actually Tulkus and are either not trained or improperly trained are a great loss to themselves, the Dharma, and sentient beings. I say this having chosen not to allow my son to be trained in the traditional way. Should many of the young Tulkus be undergoing stricter, better training? Yes. Should I be undergoing stricter, better training? Also yes.

This is the Kaliyuga, the Dharma-ending age. Peoples' kleshas are getting stronger and stronger, thicker and thicker. We are all in this downward spiral of degeneration, and it takes more and more merit and wisdom to escape, let alone reverse, this trend. Do many young Tulkus today need a wake-up call? Yes, from my experience, I think so. Will all of Them heed that wake-up call? No. Will some? Yes -- some. Are there some really good young Tulkus out there? Yes, in my experience there are. Check out Khedrup Jigme Kundrol in Bhutan. Check out Guru Khyentse Ozer in Bhutan. Check out Kathog Situ Rinpoche in Bhutan. Check out Gyalwai Nyugu Rinpoche. All four of these young Tulkus appear, at least to me and my clouded perception, to exhibit real renunciation. And isn't that the real problem with those Tulkus Who are not living up to our expectations? Lack of renunciation.

Sorry if I'm rambling but I don't think the system is bogus top to bottom. I think the system requires change, possibly even radical change, but I don't think it should be scrapped entirely.

I sometimes wonder if YN is going to be seen a little more by webcast. The movie on his life and relationship with his father was great, and so were the activities accompanying the release of the movie (My Reincarnation), but since that time I have not heard much about YN's role within Dzogchen Community (present/future). I tuned in to the webcast he gave, but I don't know of any other webcasts besides the one he gave which was already several years ago.

Do you know what his activities are or will be?

Malcolm wrote:
ChNN in this case is really convinced his son is the reincarnation of his other uncle, the least known Khyentse incarnation. [people should read The Lamp That Enlightens Narrow Minds ]. For a while. Yeshe was listed with his father as a teacher in the Community. Then he apparently decided he did not want to be in that role anymore, so he had his name removed. This was after My Reincarnation was aired all over the world.

Characteristically, ChNN. while confident of his son's "pedigree", chose not to subject him to a monastic education.

AFAIK, CHNN's son and daughter will inherit the responsibility of continuing their father's legacy. Who knows what it will look like. I have no idea, myself.

Truthfully, there is very little knowledge of Dzogchen teachings these days among the younger generation of Tibetan lamas. It is mostly intellectual dancing on books. These young guys really do not have very much knowledge even of the meaning of the two stages. They are mostly sutrayāna Kadampa style lamrimpas. So it is not wonder that people who follow such lamas have very little understanding of the real essence of the teachings.

And that’s likely not a coincidence. A study published this week in Nature Communications connects worsening wildfire seasons to climate change, and suggests the trend will continue in the years ahead as climate change rolls forward. “Wildfires occur at the intersection of dry weather, available fuel and ignition sources,” the study’s authors write. Of those factors, “weather is the most variable.”

The study also suggests that wildfires will themselves play a role in driving climate change, creating a nasty feedback loop.

Kings may or may not be fools however, and I would resist generalisations about people simply based upon how they were born. Such a natural aversion towards a group of people regardless of deeds done or undone cannot be, in my opinion, very equanimous or compassionate, and seems to reflect only knee-jerk reaction.

Well of course they're in treasonous rebellion. What strikes one most blatantly about the Declaration is how almost none of what it claims is true. But sovereignty rests on more than legalities. To be a formalist about things, a right can simply be a legal acceptance of the way things are, as how a right by conquest works. The rebels defeated the crown's forces, with the support of Britain's rivals. Therefore the USA is theirs.

But again, I may have let my sufi background influence my judgement too much. In sufism the two major sources of attachment and cravings are sex and food, and it is believed that all desires derive from these two basic drives. Which makes food consumption a major indicator of how much progress a sufi student is making. Apparently this tool is not used in buddhism, which seems to mae sense since I have never heard of fasting exercises in buddhism (or do they exist?).

Malcolm wrote:
In Tibetan Medicine as well as Ayurveda being slim is ideal from a health standpoint; however in Buddhadharma weight is not used as an indicator of spiritual progress.

We have enough issues in the West with poor body image, there is no point in confusing weight with spiritual progress. The two are unrelated.

That said, one should endeavor to reduce attachment to food, clothes, and so on., and in Tibetan Buddhism at any rate, there are any number of ways to go about this.

Tantric ngondro as is practiced in Kagyu and Nyingma has never existed in Sakya until a couple of decades ago, so to say that it is important in Sakya is a gross overstatement. The only existing Sakya ngondro was composed by the late Deshung Rinpoche on the request of some students who wanted to have in Sakya the equivalent of the ngondro practiced in the other traditions. That's it. A couple of other Sakya lamas started teaching it afterwards but it is by no means required, or seen as very important and it is not really connected to any cycle per se, although it ends with a Sapan Guru Yoga, which is considered very precious in the tradition.

Ngondro in Sakya is connected with one's sadhana practice and done within that context, adding mandala and guru yoga in their appropriate places.

For example, the lengthy Ngondro commentary by twentieth century Nalendra master, Ngalo Khechen, does not present an independent ngondro text, but rather, frames the ngondro recitations within the context of the Hevajra sadhanas, and also includes the manner of doing Ngondro for Naro Khachod, Yamantaka and Tsembupa Chenrezi. According to him, for example, prostrations are better done with the guru yoga accumulation, not refuge.

Nevertheless, in Sakya, the idea of counting accumulations is a rather modern innovations. In the past, when embarking on a long retreat, one would devote some weeks or months to ngondro.

Deshung Tulku's ngondro is indeed a modern composition, and is influenced by Kongtrul's ngondro, but it is not the classical way Ngondro in Sakya has been done.

Ngalo Khenchen's text is highly influenced by Paltrul Rinpoche, containing long passages quoted from kun bzang bla ma'i zhal lung.

A new grand solar minimum would not trigger another LIA; in fact, the maximum 0.3°C cooling would barely make a dent in the human-caused global warming over the next century. While it would be enough to offset to about a decade's worth of human-caused warming, it's also important to bear in mind that any solar cooling would only be temporary, until the end of the solar minimum.

Well, without going too much into restricted areas, of course seminal continence is also valued in Vajrayana. One treads a line here in discussing it at all, but to say that it is not a factor in Buddhist practice needs some qualification.

Malcolm wrote:
In general the tantras of secret mantra do not distinguish between sukra and ojas. However, the principle reason for seminal continence in Vajrayāna practice is that for men, semen is the basis of experiencing a blissful sensation.

In reality, what one needs to conserve is ojas. ChNN's Birth, LIfe and Death discusses the issue of the difference between semen [ khu ba ] and ojas [ mdangs ] in some detail and recommends releasing the former while conserving the latter.

In the Dzogchen intimate instructions, for example, the Khandro Nyinthig, this distinction is fully articulated, and there are techniques for conserving the latter while releasing the former.

In general, practitioners of Dzogchen do not have to worry about the issue of seminal retention unless they are suffering from ojas depletion [ojas is mainly depleted by stress]. They are more concerned with other kinds of bindus, the "ultimate" ones; not the the ones that come about from eating food.

In Tibetan medicine it is stated that forcefully trying to suppress ejaculation leads to stones and even impotence. So, guys, if you feel it move, it is better to let it go.

It is so fundamental to their view, they even call themselves "nang pa", insiders, because they are convinced that the sole cause of all problems in the world come from inside, not from outside.

Porn is a different issue altogether. The main danger with porn for the individual, is that might cause them to become a specific kind of paṇḍaka, only able to be aroused by watching others have sex.

At maximum it perpetuates the attachment to sexual pleasure that already exists in your mindstream, just like having consensual sex with a partner does.

The advantage of masturbation to sex with a partner is that no attachment to another person is involved. For example it can not become the cause for being jealous and all the possible negative consequences this might develop (like insulting, harming or killing another person in a fit of jealous rage)

The positive and negative nature of actions is clearly defined by virtue of their object. So for example, harming a Buddha or killing an Arhat is a much worse transgression than killing a normal human being. The weight of an action is defined by our intent, satisfaction and so on.

My point still stands — when one masturbates, one is not harming anyone else, no more than eating food harmful to anyone else.

The criteria of why the ten nonvirtues are nonvirtuous has to do mainly with how the seven physical nonvirtues impact others around us.

Masturbation is a transgression only for monastics, while it may be included in sexual misconduct from a preceptual point of view, it has to be considered primarily a transgression of disobedience. Sexual misconduct is a natural transgression because it harms others. Since masturbation does not fulfill this requirement, it is therefore not part of sexual misconduct. These days it is a little hard to justify oral sex and anal sex as sexual misconduct as well, from the natural nonvirtue point of view. I think in general this is why there is just not much heat about it. One does not hear Buddhist teachers railing against fellatio and cunnalingus, etc., in the same way they trip out against eating meat and drinking alcohol...speaking of which it is time for me to go have dinner...

While I will certainly agree with you that there is no inherently existing negative mental factors, nevertheless mental factors can be considered inherently bad if they invariably produce negative effects.

But really, we do not have to be allergic to the word "inherent." Indian Buddhist scholars use it all the time in a positive fashion, even Nāgārjuna.

The main point of course is that the ten nonvirtues are nonvirtues naturally, and do not depend on a social context to make them "bad." If you indulge in them, you will take rebirth in lower realms; if you practice their opposite, you will take rebirth in higher realms — no precepts needed.

Zhen Li said:
You are not properly making a distinction between precepts and the ten nonvirtues. You must learn to make this distinction, otherwise you will never understand the principle of Hināyāna teachings.

The ten nonvirtues are nonvirtues because they cause disruption to others. The ten virtues are virtues because observing them creates harmony with others. This has nothing to do with vows, trainings and so on.

Malice, greed and ignorance are nonvirtues inherently because they motivate acts which disturb others. Their opposite, love, generosity and wisdom are inherently virtuous because they motivate acts that benefit others. This is what makes virtuous conduct socially valuable and laudable.

This is the first I've heard of such inherency, and is exactly the kind of thing that theanarchist is arguing against. Source?

Malcolm wrote:
You do not need a source. Do the action of animals cause them to fall into lower realms, yes or no? Animals cannot take precepts, nor train in them, nevertheless their virtuous and nonvirtuous actions have karmic consequences. Therefore all actions are either virtuous, nonvirtuous or neutral, inherently so.

However, you can understand this from Vasubandhu's discussion of alcohol with regard to lay persons were he makes a distinction between transgressions by nature and transgressions through disobedience.

We can understand then that the precepts concerning killing, stealing, lying and sexual misconduct are all vows linked with natural nonvirtues, the breaking of which are transgressions by nature  — the rest of Hinayāna Buddhist vows are transgressions through disobedience.

Again, this is not very specific. yes, mouth, anus, etc.

In short, it is extremely silly to make broad declarations for the Tibetan tradition on the basis of one text by an Indian author which is not supported, AFAICT, in sūtras found in the Tibetan Canon.

Sexual misconduct should be defined on the basis of conduct that is harmful others. We can see in the instance of minors, those under the protection of others, the spouses of others, in places where public offense will be taken and so on, that there is clear harm to others. But we cannot see this in the case of masturbation. Frankly, it is a little difficult to see how oral sex is harmful to others as long as it is consensual. I would suggest that morays around nonharmful sexual conduct are strictly cultural and may be adjusted to suit cultural climates. In general the ten nonvirtues all depend on how one relates to other sentient beings. It is very easy to see why malice, greed and ignorance are harmful to others, as motivators for killing, stealing, sexual misconduct in general, as well as lying, harsh speech, calumny and gossip. But is very hard to see where consensual sexual acts can fit here as nonvirtues unless one is a monk or a nun.\

What you fail to understand is that the ten nonvirtues are defined as "natural" in so far as it does not matter if you are ant or an anteater. They have nothing to do with trainings, and everything to do with establishing what creates eudaemonic environment for everyone. Precepts are abstracted out of those, and of course, we can understand that consuming alcohol, for lay people, is the only prohibition which is by command, rather than through observing inherency. When you say that masturbation is sexual misconduct, you are making the claim it is inherently nonvirtuous, like killing, stealing, lying and assaulting minors.

If one has a specific problem, one applies to Buddha's teachings to that problem. But there is no such thing as one teaching that suits every person.

Your next question can be answered for example, by looking in the Abhidharmakośabhaṣyaṃ. Theravadins for example, do not accept the antarabhāva because they reject the sūtra in which it is taught since it is absent from their own canon. Vasubandhu points that many sūtras have been lost, and then proceeds to argue the point for the antarabhāva on logical grounds.

If you have a catechistic attitude towards precepts, it is unlikely you will understand that they are only necessary for people who have a problem refraining from killing, lying, sexual misconduct and so on. Those of us who do not have these issues do not need precepts at all. We also do not need to call ourselves "Buddhists" to be practitioners of Buddhadharma, of which there are many kinds.

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof...
People who work for the state therefore are not permitted to impose their religious prejudice in the coarse of their normal duties, and if they are found to do so, are likely to be prosecuted for violating the civil rights of others. Somehow, the tea party people have forgotten all about the first amendment.

However, the basis of the SCOTUS decision regaring marriage is founded on the due process clause of the 14th amendment:
"[w]ithout doubt...denotes not merely freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life, to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring up children, to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience, and generally to enjoy those privileges long recognized at common law as essential to the orderly pursuit of happiness by free men.
You see, here, there is no restriction placed around who can marry, establish a home and raise children. Anyone may marry anyone else, and unless they are proven to be unfit, may raise children.

You can argue all you like that when this was written individuals meant individual men and women, nevertheless, societies change, and since gender is not specified in the Constitution, and since DOMA has been thrown out as entirely unconstitutional (rightly so), marriage equality was recognized. It is a done deal, and the rest of the modern world will follow suit, leaving Fundamentalists to deal with the issue as best they can, whether well nor poorly. We are not responsible for their feelings on any level.

There are at least two place in Mahāyāna sutra where the issue of gender identity is basically found to be a delusion: the episode concerning the Goddess of the Ganges in the Vimalakirti Sutra and the Nāgā Princess in the Lotus. I am sure there are more.

What is it about marriage that makes it a basic human right? Why do we need legislation in the first place?

Malcolm wrote:
It is quite simply really, married people are afforded certain rights and privileges denied to unmarried people. Those rights and privileges are granted by law surrounding property transference and so on. In the end, it really all has to do with the disposition of property and inheritance. That is why the State is involved with this issue.

maybay said:
The tacit suggestion is that marriage is "normal" and that homosexuals are now normal because they can marry.

Malcolm wrote:
No, the suggestion is that homosexuals are normal, and because they are normal they should not be barred from enjoying the same rights and privileges that other normal people enjoy.

maybay said:
Where does that leave people who don't marry?

Malcolm wrote:
People who are in committed relationships who choose not to marry now suffer from a lack of rights and privileges regardless of their gender orientation.

We live in a federal republic. This means that federal law trumps state law every time. SCOTUS has decided that the states are not allowed to pass laws forbidding people of the same gender to be married. This is a good thing.

Some things, like marriage equality, simply boil down to questions of fairness. Fairness, as we know, is the essence of justice. As Rawls notes:

maybay said:
The two principles of justice (noted above) are as follows:

a. Each person has an equal claim to a fully adequate scheme of equal basic rights and liberties, which scheme is compatible with the same scheme for all; and in this scheme the equal political liberties, and only those liberties, are to be guaranteed their fair value.

b. Social and economic inequalities are to satisfy two conditions: first, they are to be attached to positions and offices open to all under conditions of fair equality of opportunity; and second, they are to be to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged members of society.

Malcolm wrote:

Further:

maybay said:
This priority of the right over the good in justice as fairness turns out to be a central feature of the conception. It imposes certain criteria on the design of the basic structure as a whole; these arrangements must not tend to generate propensities and attitudes contrary to the two principles of justice (that is, to certain principles which are given from the first a definite content) and they must insure that just institutions are stable.

Malcolm wrote:
RAWLS, John (2009-06-30). A THEORY OF JUSTICE (ORIG EDN) (Oxford Paperbacks 301 301) (pp. 31-32). Harvard University Press. Kindle Edition.

The fact is that allowing different states to have different standards for marriage compromised principle a.

maybay said:
Now consider the losers in this decision. Do they sound like the kind of people who can afford to lose ground? Do you believe them when they say its important to them?

Malcolm wrote:
They have not lost anything apart from their face. The idea that marriage equality = discrimination against Christians is absolutely ludicrous.

As far as anonymity goes, people whose actual identity is not secret tend to be taken more seriously in discussions; at least, I take them more seriously. I tend to regard the posts of the anonymous as being more frivolous, less worthy of attention, and their opinions of less consequence.

I personally think it is disingenuous to conceal one's teachers, but hey, that's just me. I frankly think that Buddhist boards should have non-anonymity policies. Tried that at Vajracakra, and people were too freaked out to sign up. So we gave it up — market forces prevailed.

In other words, do beings deserve the consequences of their karma? My understanding is that buddhadharma is not about things being fair and unfair, because there is no judgment; karma is only a description of reality, not a prescription of how it should be. The only thing Shakyamuni thought beings deserved was to be enlightened, but sadly their karma prevented that from happening.

However, I've heard other Buddhists say that karma is fair and that people deserve the higher realms, lower realms, et cetera, kind of like, "What goes around comes around." It seems lacking in compassion to me. Mahasi Sayadaw used the word "deserve" in this essay on karma, or at least that's how it was translated.

The study from Mora and the University of Hawaii, Manoa, shifts the way in which climate scientists have been examining the implications of greenhouse emissions.
While most have focused on the rapidly warming climate in the Arctic and the effects on wildlife such as polar bears and also sea levels, Mora's team are concerned with the effects on people - specifically the tropics - where the majority of the world's population lives and whose citizens have contributed the least to global warming.
It is in the already warm tropics that an increase of only a couple of degrees can alter the balance of life, crippling crops, spreading disease and leading to mass migration away to cooler climes.
'The warming in the tropics is not as much but we are rather more quickly going to go outside that recent experience of temperature and that is going to be devastating to species and it is probably going to be devastating to people,' said Stuart Pimm, a conservation biologist at Duke University, to
NBC News.
Mora and his colleagues collated global climate models and built an index of estimates on when a given spot on the globe will change beyond temperatures experienced on Earth over the past 150 years between 1860 and 2005.

They say that rebirth as an animal is due to the emotion of ignorance or confusion. Ignorance isn't an emotion in English, so this confuses me. Does it mean naively holding wrong views? Well technically, doesn't everyone who is not Buddhist hold wrong views? What sort of mind state would result in you being reborn as an animal and not a human?

I'm not calling you out, Malcolm, but I too would like clarification about your comment that Chatral Rinpoche is speaking to non-practitioners.

This is somewhat relevant for me, as some close dharma friends follow the tradition of Chatral-la, Shabkar, Patrul and so on, and they're pretty serious about the vegetarian thing, and they too point to Chatral Rinpoche and his family.  I also have close dharma friends who follow the tradition held by your teacher, Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche, whom I also consider a teacher from webcast transmissions, who follows the traditional view that eating animals benefits them.

Norbu Rinpoche insists that the point of view on meat-eating expressed by Shabkar, Nyal Pema Duddul and so on are aimed at non-practitioners. This is where I derive my opinion. This is why he says again and again, if you are a common Mahāyāna practitioner, you should not eat meat. But if you are a Dzogchen practitioner, you should eat (some) meat. You also should drink (some) alcohol.

"Chatral Rinpoche is speaking to non-practitioners."

Loppon-la, where are you getting this idea about Kyabje Chatral Rinpoche? If this teaching is only for non-practitioners, why is He so personally insistent on not eating meat? When I used to prescribe Chinese medicines for Him, even these had to be free of any animal ingredients. His whole family are vegetarians, His entire retinue. These people are some pretty heavy-hitting practitioners. Are you saying Seymo Saraswati Rinpoche is not a practitioner, Khandro Kamala is not a practitioner?

I've eaten in His house with Him and His family a number of time. No one is eating meat.

Malcolm wrote:
I understand that Chatral Rinpoche is himself a strict vegetarian and teetotaler since the time he was 48, I believe.

But here, Chatral Rinpoche is setting an example for people who are not really practitioners (and I am excluding his family, close entourage). It is understandable. Most Tibetans are not really Dzogchen practitioners. That is the context in which you need to understand both mine and ChNN's statements.

Some Nyingma empowerments have a large number of subsidiary parts: the dorje empowerment, the bell empowerment, the shawl empowerment, the earring empowerment and so on. There can be dozens of them. One possibility is the "hair" empowerment in which the disciple is "empowered" and committed to never cut their hair again. Just like monks and nuns shave their heads as a sign of renunciation, so the long hair of the dzogchen yogi is worn as a sign of the disciple's commitment to leaving their mind in its natural state.

My tip would be to avoid it unless you are very sure, as you may find, perhaps some years down the line, that you want or need to look more conventional again.

I think it's useful to appreciate that there are subtexts woven through this subject.   It's clear to me that inji converts to vajrayana are responding to a variety of issues, as are contemporary lamas, all of which stand outside the skillful means of the vajrayana.  Quite bluntly, at least in America, we've gone insane when it comes to food, in particular animal products.  It's the only time in human history that people intentionally drive animals into various disease states only to eat them.  It's a far cry from hunting-gathering, and it's a far cry from culling herd-stocks from a local microecology.  It's really a form of madness. It's also an American thing to feel that we're malnourished unless our whole alimentary canal is full of red meat, which is another form of madness, and simultaneously a health and environmental crisis.  Whether the response of vegetarian ganapuja's is the proper response is really up to individuals and their lamas IMHO, but I think it's best to be realistic and honest that people are responding to this issue of meat eating along multiple axes...

Of course people are responding to this issue along a variety of axes. I am merely clarifying the principles enunciated by Chogyal Namkhai Norbu and Dzogchen teachings (Do you have any idea of how many kinds of meat are recommended for Chulen in the sgra thal gyur tantra?)

Meat and dairy consumption is rising world wide because, frankly, meat and dairy based diets are more nutritionally dense than solely plant-based diets and people become larger and more powerful when they rely on them. When they enter the middle class, of course they want more meat in their diets. Of course this brings a range of health issues into play.

1) First you have to know Lam Rim to compare, and I know Lam Rim, there isn't any "Lam Rim" lacking in CHNN's teachings,
in other words, all of deepest levels of Lam Rim are fulfilled in the Dzogchen teachings of CHNN, but you have to know what you are looking for. If you want straight up traditional teachers to learn Lam Rim there are many, for example, step by step here: http://thubtenchodron.org/1991/04/stages-path-enlightenment-intro/ but if you know the teachings, and you hear CHNN year in and out, you will see that Dzogchen path fulfills and explains the essence of all the Lam Rim teachings. Also remember that CHNN is a Dzogchen master, he is coming at those very topics from that view, therefore the answer to your question lies in the path itself. That path is where you will see differences and similarities to a highly traditional approach, but there is nothing on this path that goes contrary to those teachings, rather it fulfills those teachings quite completely. Remember CHNN was trained thoroughly and completely in Lam Rim, he has both an extensive Kagyu background and Sakyapa background and knows the Lam Rim well, he could easily compare back and forth topic by topic point by point how Dzogchen path does not lack the essence of the Lam Rim.  Quite frankly many of the teachers in Dzoghchen community and beyond can explain this, an in depth answer could fill many pages.

2) Yes, there are many places like this, both in the USA and all over the world. If you are in the USA toward the East Coast you could visit Conway Ma. this summer when CHNN is there, and meet members of the Dzogchen community and learn some practices in person. http://tsegyalgar.org/localcenters/tsegyalgareast/

And regarding the second point, thank you, that's good to know!

You cannot break samaya if you have never received empowerment or Dzogchen transmission because you do not have it.

anjali said:
Agreed. In an ideal world no animals would be slaughtered. Your answer helps me refine my question.

Sadly, we don't live in an ideal world. Vajrayana practitoners live in a world where so many animals are slaughtered for consumption. Given that fact, would the most compassionate diet possible be one where every bite we take is making a connection with a slaughtered animal?

Yes, I know this is going to an extreme, but I'm not being flippant. Just pushing the envelope to get at the full implication that eating meat with right view benefits the consumed animal. Followed to it's logical conclusion, it would seem to imply that the most ethical/compassionate diet for a vajrayana practitioner living in today's world should be an exclusively meat-eating diet?

Malcolm wrote:
Every bite we take is already connected with a slaughtered animal down to every piece of lettuce. Therefore, the most ethical and compassionate diet is to understand that every thing we eat involves the death of some creature somewhere, somehow.

The principle of Buddhadharma is avihimsa, non-harming. But there is very little we can do in the world control the harm of the kind of wide spread agriculture and other related industries do to the world and the living creatures in it, both sentient and non-sentient. We cannot control other human beings, all we can do is control ourselves, refrain from harming others, and try to benefit those who have been harmed by any means possible. When someone who has received Dzogchen teachings refuses to eat meat when it is offered to them, or in a puja, they are effectively deciding not to help some being that has been harmed. In this case, not eating meat harms compassion.

Since we are not Jains nor followers of Devadatta, we do not believe that karma is an automatic non-volitional force that comes from every act that we engage in. Karma only comes from any intentional act in which we engage.

Also we have a responsibility to ourselves. We must eat meat when it is indicated for our health. There are, in both Ayurveda and Tibetan medicine, many forms of meat, many kinds of animal products, that are used regularly. The reason we do not use regular Tibetan incense for Nāgā pujas is because in general Tibetan incense contains musk, which is harmful and offensive to Nāgās. Also we must not eat too much of any one thing, because this will cause our humors to become unbalanced. So the principle of nonharming includes not harming ourselves, and that extends to our diets.

As in everything, there are limits to our capacity. So we do what we can, always wish we could do more and never lose our focus of compassion for all.

If we follow this reasoning to it's logical conclusion, would you agree that your ideal diet (not considering health issues) would be exclusively carnivorous, and from as many different animals as possible? The reasoning being that one would want to create good causes for as many animals as possible, and that would entail eating as much meat as possible from as many different animals as possible?

From where I sit the gist of the entire issue comes down to; do I personally have enough confidence in a specific wong I have received to invest myself in a retreat on that practice? Because if the wong was not valid I will be wasting my time, no fruit will come.

As such, the question for me personally is really moot. Up until now I have not done long retreats on any practice, so what does it matter? And if I do decide to go do a retreat somewhere, I've got all the in-person wongs I could ever need. So for me I can happily participate on internet Dharma all day long and presumably it will be only of some benefit. I don't have to actually rely on any of it. I liken it to the idea behind prayer flags, which is that the mantras and prayers on the flags get blown downwind and spread their blessings that way. Only instead of the wind the blessings "blown" all over the planet via the internet. Why not?

For those that are isolated and have to rely on internet Dharma as the basis for their practice, I suggest that they do a little study of how "faith" comes into play for an initiation. The prevailing internet culture, and even the prevailing modern in-person Dharma culture, adamantly insists that faith is not required in Buddhism. In contrast to that, Garchen R. has said that without faith even an in-person wong is ineffective. This needs to be understood and not rationalized or re-defined in such a way as to accommodate our modern preconditions for Dharma.

All very good advice, unfortunately, it has nothing do with the question at hand. The question at hand is how to properly enter into the training Tulku Orgyen is talking about. So this topic is not mere criticism for criticism's sake.

Lhasa said:
TULKU URGYEN
Extract from a Teaching.
Pure Perception:

"Vajrayana in general is training in pure perception—Dzogchen is even much more so.

How can you call yourself a practitioner of Dzogchen if you spend your time defaming, finding fault with or criticizing others? Maintain the view of pure sight, sound and awareness. This is how samsara and nirvana actually are, pervaded by the three kayas or three vajras. Sentient beings might not be aware of their Buddha Nature, but they are nevertheless endowed with the three kayas.

You need to train in pure perception by accepting and respecting the three kayas in everyone. Great masters do perceive all sights, sound and cognitive activity as infinite purity. Once recognition of awareness is stabilized, there is no more impurity to be perceived.

Train in this by thinking: "As the Buddha Nature pervades all beings, not a single being is unsuitable." The more you respect Buddha Nature in others and train in pure perception, the more your own practice will progress.

Slandering beings is slandering Buddha nature; stop doing that. If due to your own impurity you perceive mistakes in other beings, at least do not voice them.
If your awareness practice is too weak to sustain pure perception naturally, try to develop a rapport within an intellectual understanding of Buddha Nature in others. Know that your impure perception of others only happens either because you have not recognized genuine awareness, or because that recognition is not developed. Criticizing and slandering others puts you out of tune with the enlightened essence.

You mainly harm yourself. The most unrealized so-called practitioner of Dzogchen can at least keep his or her mouth shut, even if he can not actually maintain the view.

A deceitful person sees everybody with suspicion and finds many mistakes in others. A pure person naturally perceives others to be good. How much more so does a perfect yogin or yogini. He or she has the perception of infinite purity. They will actually perceive all forms as the bodies of the deities, all sounds as mantra, and all thoughts and emotions as the display of awareness.

In their perception of pure sight, sound and awareness there is no attachment to friends, or aversion to enemies. Awareness itself being free from concepts of good and bad, proper and improper, they perceive everything as great equanimity. They do not accept or reject friends or foes. They perceive not the tiniest speck of impurity.

As is said, "Arriving at a golden island, one cannot find ordinary earth or stones even if one searches for them." In general, good and bad are your own perception, so you cannot possibly see faults in others when your own are purified."

So that applies to the other 5 meats too?

Then what about certain statements that they should be consumed in ganapujas? One must be a vidyadhara to consume the 5 meats?

Malcolm wrote:
I said in general. Ganapujas are a special case. Here, the point is consuming the five meats traditionally not consumed by Indians and left in the charnel grounds, i.e., meat of humans, cows, elephants, dogs and horses. Why? Because these meats were regarded by Brahmins as impure. The point in this instance is to overcome attachment to so called "pure and impure" food. And no, one does not have to be a Vidyadhāra to consume these meats in the ganacakra. But I think that most people would not be able to manage this. This is a general principle in niruttarayogatantra.

The principle here in Dzogchen is however a bit different. The point here is to create a positive cause for the cattle, fowl and fish that we humans normally consume in order that sentient being meet with the Dharma, and so on, in future lives.

There is the interesting case of Urgyen Lingpa's body. Urgyen Lingpa was held to be a seven timer, i.e, reborn as a brahmin or in Tibet, a tulku, seven times. It is held that his flesh had the power to create a special cause for those who ate small portions of it. So, his mummified kudung (unfortunately now destroyed) in Tibet was pockmarked from people taking small portions of his flesh for this reason. Once, when Chogyal Namkahi Norbu was giving Medicine Buddha in Tsegyalgar, he included a pill containing the flesh of this master in the vase water.

Yes, the practice of sgrol ba, liberation, is the practice of wrathfully separating a sentient being's consciousness from its body through ritual means and delivering it into the dharmadhātu. There are ten criteria through which someone or something might be subject to such a rite. For example, there is a large wasp that lives in Bhutan and Southern Tibet called "rGya nag rgyal po" (Chinese King). It kills many small creatures and drags them into its burrow, paralyzes them, and lays its eggs in them. According to the late Kunzang Dechen Lingpa, this creature is completely wicked, and its sting can be fatal to humans. Using this wasp as an example, he said there are some creatures who should be killed and that one should not naively allow one's Mahāyāna orientation to prevent one from seeing what is the greater good for all beings, just to protect the life of one wicked being. He said that in this case, proper Mahāyāna conduct would be to eliminate Gyanag Gyalpos wherever and whenever one found them because these creatures are pernicious.

If you buy glue, you are paying the butcher for the hooves and so on. Do you have pets? If so, again you are paying the butcher.

Are you karmically responsible? No. karma is volition and and verbal and physical acts which come from volitions. If you have no volition to kill something, you do not accrue the karma of killing.

Bhavaviveka proves, even while mentioning the Lanka and so on, that eating meat in three ways does not contribute to suffering. If eating meat pure in three ways contributes to suffering, he points out so does wearing wool, leather, silk etc.

So, in fact, as long as the meat one consumes is pure in three ways it does not contribute to the suffering of a given animal at all. I know this is hard for people to understand, but it is the case.

In reality it is impossible for us to remove the suffering of other sentient beings at all, even one tiny bit. Not even Buddhas can remove the suffering of other beings. If we believe that by refusing to eat meat we are reducing some other beings suffering, we are deluding ourselves because we have not understood the nature of suffering at all. As Maitreya points out in samsare there is not so much as an area the size of a needle tip in which happiness may be found. Therefore, what can we do to help? All we can do is make efforts at creating positive causes for sentient beings to meet the Dharma in the future. For example, the Root Tantra of Heruka states that Vajrayāna practitioners themselves are "Liberation through seeing." Any being who sees Vajrayāna practitioner plants a seed for meeting the Buddhas and hearing Dharma teachings. But dead animals cannot see or hear anything. Therefore, we have methods connected with creating a positive cause for those sentient beings whom human beings commonly consume because we have a closer relationship with those types of animals.

If they bought based on need they would likely be more frugal and less finicky about what they eat, and where they shop.  Instead, I would estimate that something like 10% of the vegans/vegetarians I know eat based on need, the rest have something akin to an eating disorder, often possible due to income. Sounds harsh I know,  but we have to make a distinction between ways of practicing vegetarianism or veganism to answer some of these questions adequately.

Question is, "Is it better, out of compassion, to eschew eating meat or not?" ChNN's answer is that question is that it is better not to eschew eating meat out of compassion. If a Dzogchen practitioner is truly compassionate it is better they eat meat.

Naturally, people are also free to do what they feel is right.

In reality, supermarkets order far more meat than they will sell, knowingly, in order to keep fresh meat on hand at all times.

Yes, there is that also. For example, when Patrul was complaining about monasteries, it was a time when monasteries would contract a certain number of sheep to be slaughtered at a given time. Now, there is no need for anyone to contract with anyone. In the first world under capitalism, the system is that one, with sufficient money, can buy any food one likes more or less at any time of the year without having to special order it from anyone. The cost of food production has been driven artificially low in order that massive surpluses in food are generated so that waste of food does not impact the profitability of grocery markets (thank you, international migrant labor!).

AFAIK this is not a myth. It really does harm/kill many fewer animals to eat one pound of vegetables than one pound of meat (which required many pounds of vegetation to be raised).

Also, I see many spurious arguments here about why buying one chicken at the supermarket does not cause the death of one chicken. It does not cause the death of that one chicken, but the supermarket WILL order one more chicken to fill its spot. You may pretend that second chicken has nothing to do with you... until the next week when you go back to the market and lo and behold, there are more dead chickens waiting for you.

Whether you choose to participate in this or not is surely a very individual matter, and the matter of connecting with dead chickens is far above my pay grade. But it's crazy to take part in a system and then pretend you have precisely zero complicity in it. We all make choices that harm other beings, and though there's no point in being weighed down by guilt over them, it's disingenuous to claim that we're doing all of them for noble reasons. We can simply do what we can, and admit we're not fully compassionate beings yet.

Malcolm wrote:
What follows is a true story — some people when to the present Karmapa, Urgyen Thrinly, asking him if is was better to ransom a cow or not ransom it? The Karmapa replied, well, if you ransom the cow, another cow will just be moved up the line to be slaughtered sooner, whereas, if you do not intercede, the next cow in line be able to live longer. So he declined to give them advice in the matter.

As far as your counterclaim goes, that applies only to feed lot animals, animals raised in CFO's and so on, like most chickens, pigs, turkeys and what not.

As far as your claim about supermarkets go, it is also false. Supermarkets will continue to order meat from meat suppliers for as long as there are people who eat meat (i.e. forever).

Also, even Vegans participate in the trade of flesh by continuing to eat organically grown products which are fertilized with bone meal, blood meal and feather meal, all very standard organic amendments which are substantial cash inputs into the slaughterhouse business.

The point is that there is no one who is not complicit in some manner in "the system".

As for myself, I apply the methods taught by my gurus, knowing that I am making a difference.

Eating meat will not cause a problem in their case.

People are free. Whether they eat meat or not is not the issue. The issue really that Rinpoche is pointing to is the fallacies in the idea that choosing not to eat meat is more "compassionate". He has pointed in many ways the falsity of this thinking because it does not truly address the suffering of nonhumans in the whole chain of agricultural production.

Quite honestly, the American Philosopher, Robert Nozik provides a much better and more well reasoned argument for not eating animals in his Anarchy, State and Utopia where he discards utilitarian arguments for the eating of animals because animals "count for something."

Anders said:
If some animals count for something, which animals count, how much do they count, and how can this be determined? Suppose (as I believe the evidence supports) that eating animals is not necessary for health and is not less expensive than alternate equally healthy diets available to people in the United States. The gain, then, from the eating of animals is pleasures of the palate, gustatory delights, varied tastes. I would not claim that these are not truly pleasant, delightful, and interesting. The question is: do they, or rather does the marginal addition in them gained by eating animals rather than only nonanimals, outweigh the moral weight to be given to animals’ lives and pain? Given that animals are to count for something, is the extra gain obtained by eating them rather than nonanimal products greater than the moral cost? How might these questions be decided?

Malcolm wrote:

Anders said:
What about persons distinguishes them from animals, so that stringent constraints apply to how persons may be treated, yet not to how animals may be treated? 11 Could beings from another galaxy stand to us as it is usually thought we do to animals, and if so, would they be justified in treating us as means à la utilitarianism? Are organisms arranged on some ascending scale, so that any may be sacrificed or caused to suffer to achieve a greater total benefit for those not lower on the scale? Such an elitist hierarchical view would distinguish three moral statuses (forming an interval partition of the scale):

Status 1: The being may not be sacrificed, harmed, and so on, for any other organism’s sake.
Status 2: The being may be sacrificed, harmed, and so on, only for the sake of beings higher on the scale, but not for the sake of beings at the same level.
Status 3: The being may be sacrificed, harmed, and so on, for the sake of other beings at the same or higher levels on the scale.

If animals occupy status 3 and we occupy status 1, what occupies status 2? Perhaps we occupy status 2! Is it morally forbidden to use people as means for the benefit of others, or is it only forbidden to use them for the sake of other people, that is, for beings at the same level?* Do ordinary views include the possibility of more than one significant moral divide (like that between persons and animals), and might one come on the other side of human beings?

Malcolm wrote:
Nozick, Robert (2013-11-12). Anarchy, State, and Utopia (pp. 45-46). Basic Books. Kindle Edition.


There are also Singer's arguments.

So the real question that ChNN is placing before us is: what does one do for the countless sentient beings that are slaughtered in food production? How do we benefit all these sentient beings (who indeed count for something)? What method do we use? Even Vegans have to admit that they use the above elite hierarchical model in their ethics, a "being may be sacrificed, harmed, and so on, for the sake of other beings at the same or higher levels on the scale" merely by permitting agriculture. However, their excuse, is in my opinion very lame. They claim in general, "While it is true that beings die in the production of plant-based food, we do not intend that harm nor are we raising beings to be used as food. The death of beings in food production is a regrettable fact of agriculture, a by-product that we do not intend but cannot avoid in order to sustain ourselves."

In other words, they claim they are following their diet because of the intrinsic value of living creatures, but at the same time resort to utilitarianism to rationalize the broad destruction of creatures in food production, claiming a utilitarian advantage to a plant based diet as a selling point, i.e. the myth that "less creatures would be killed in a plant-based diet." The other hoax in their thinking is that idea that we should not exploit creatures such as cows and bees for milk and honey, while happily using lady bugs to kill agricultural pests and so on.

As far as recordings go, I imagine that his thinking runs as follows, "if beginners, new people, want to practice, they can get an idea from watching an online recording, and perhaps there is some positive connection made to the teaching and if they recite the mantra, there is no harm."

But for example, HHDL makes it very clear that watching Kalacakra online does not grant one the empowerment. Also CHNN makes it very clear that empowerments that rely on substances cannot be given via webcast. Other Lamas may have a different ideas about this, but I really think in general all Lamas will agree that there is no way one can receive an empowerment from a recording of an empowerment. I am quite certain, for example, if you wrote ChNN on this subject, he would say very clearly to you that you cannot receive any kind of transmission from a recording.

And one thing I am pretty clear on is that no one receives empowerments or a lung from a recording.

I am something in a similar situation as LunaRoja, and am also informed by Pollen and others in terms of food politics.  In the final analysis, it's actually hunting-gathering that has the least ecological impact and the least amount of suffering, so I figure I'm OK interpolating between a vegetarian diet and something of a flexitarian diet.

That said, this causes me some pause in dharma circles.  I feel somewhat caught between a rock and a hard place.  My vegetarian-vegan dharma siblings evoke Shabkar and Patrul on the Tibetan side, and sutra on the Chan/Zen side, and chide me for this flexitarian approach and chide me for incorporating meat in ganapuja.  We have had vegetarian-vegan Buddhists show up for ganapuja and they have been horrified by the presence of meat.  On the flip side, when I orbit into the vegan-vegetarian side of the pool, then I have my tantrica friends chiding me for "the worst type of compassion" and for breaking samaya at ganapuja for either putting on a white tsok, or for just tasting but not actively eating meat and drinking alcohol.

In some way I feel that I am on the margin of some larger cultural issue, maybe from the Tibetan side, but maybe from the inji convert side.

It's not just about meat either.  I often encounter this belief that all five tastes must be present in the ganapuja, and this becomes something of a fault line when two people bring pickles and nobody ends up with "bitter" or "pungent".  When I ask lamas they're like, well, in my part of Tibet we offered tsampa and just tsampa because that's all we had, so it's clear the forrest is lost for the trees on many levels.

Malcolm wrote:
Ok, first it is six tastes (sweet, salty, sour, hot, bitter, astringent) and though there may be some text that specifies this, I have never seen it.

It is possible that one can do a ganapuja with nothing at all, after all, the important part is to work with circumstances. However, there is no one among us who unable to get meat and unable to get alcohol as offerings.

As to the idea of using nectar pills, well, this does not challenge one's capacity nor does it encourage one to integrate. The adoption of vegetarianism into ganapujas is a misapplication of the path of renunciation (i.e. common Mahāyāna) to Varjayāna.

According to ChNN,  Zhabkar, Paltrul and Pema Duddul's exhortations to not eat meat are for non-practitioners, that is, people who do not understand the meaning of Dzogchen teachings.

I hope this will clarify the ownership of the Sheda/Taktse Nyingma Institute, Gangtok, Sikkim.

Once an animal has been killed, its meat is inert. There is no consciousness present, ergo, purchasing the meat of an animal that has already been killed does not contribute to the suffering of that sentient being.
Otherwise, when you buy meat in a modern market, the consciousness of that animal is long dead, well on its way to yet another rebirth. There is no connection between meat that I buy, and the suffering of said animal.
Indeed, it is also not unrealistic to ask Vajrayāna practitioners to apply methods we have been taught to create positive connections so that beings whose flesh we consume meet the Dharma.

jmlee369 said:
This is one thing I've been curious about for a while now. There are several methods in both lower and higher tantric texts that enable practitioners to benefit beings by interacting in some way with dead remains. How exactly does this work if the consciousness is long gone from the body? Then there's the whole "Buddhas cannot wash away wrongdoing and obscuration with water..." thing, and how even the Buddhas and bodhisattvas cannot intervene if a being lacks the merit etc. If there is no volition on the part of the animal to create the connection, how can it be accomplished?

Malcolm wrote:
The connection is created by the practitioner towards the animal.

Solar power is good and necessary.  But the real issue lurking behind all this is sustainability.  How sustainable is the solar cell industry?  To be specific, those solar cells are made in a coal-powered factory.  So does the coal saved by their use equal the coal consumed by their manufacture?  i don't know the answer, and I bet neither do the manufacturers.  This is the type of question we need answers to in addressing climate change or any of the other sustainability issues.  I would be a lot more comfortable with solar power if the panels were made in a solar-powered factory.

I don't think Chatral is influenced by wanting donations from Chinese, and there has been a fairly long strain of vegetarianism in Nyingma.

In Mipham's Satirical poem on the four schools he notes that actually, and says that Gelugpas like meat the most.

But I think accommodating to Chinese tastes has influenced a lot of modern TB teachers. I think they are better off presenting themselves as laymen if they are such rather than being ambiguous about it to people who are uninformed though.

Eating meat is solely a problem if you killed an animal yourself, asked for it to be killed or witnessed it killed. Bhavaviveka demonstrates this quite well in the Tarkajavala.

The prohibition against eating meat may exist in the Chinese bodhisattva vows, but not in the Indian bodhisattva vows, and the Tibetan traditions that follow the latter. And as I pointed out, the Tarkajvala rejects that idea that eating meat that is pure in three ways has a fault. Bhavaviveka, a Mahayan̄ist, is quite aware of the Lanka and so on, and in fact mentions it by name.

The main sūtras that rail against meat eating are the Tathāhatagarbha sūtras.

In terms the meat that is pure in three ways, while it is indeed the case for monastics, I have yet to see that concept applied for lay people in scripture.

It applies since lay people have a vow against killing, just like bhikṣus, etc.

As for plant cultivation and the harm it causes to sentient beings, meat eating is compounding the problem because of the feed that livestock consume. Going down one trophic level would reduce the amount of beings harmed from plant cultivation as well.

Overall, while it is unrealistic to ask the whole world to adopt vegetarianism, it's not too much to ask that people reduce their meat consumption a little bit.

Worldwide, 2001-2010 was the warmest decade on record since thermometer-based observations began. Global average surface temperature has risen at an average rate of 0.15°F per decade since 1901 (see Figure 2), similar to the rate of warming within the contiguous 48 states. Since the late 1970s, however, the United States has warmed faster than the global rate.

Okay, next time I need a car, I buy one from a dealer in stolen goods, because, you know once the car is stolen from it's previous owner, it's inert.

When I buy it I automatically ask for it to be killed. The price of the meat includes the wage of the professional butcher doing it. I pay him with the money I pay for the meat.

Malcolm wrote:
Now, you are simply making irrational arguments. A car is inert from the start.

You only pay a butcher if you ask him to kill an animal for you. This is clearly forbidden. Otherwise, when you buy meat in a modern market, the consciousness of that animal is long dead, well on its way to yet another rebirth. There is no connection between meat that I buy, and the suffering of said animal. It already happened and is finished, for that life.

Karma is volition, and the secondary acts of body and voice that proceed from that. In order for killing to be part of my karma, I must request some being be killed or do it myself. Otherwise, there is no karma involved.

Not at all.

I can enjoy the taste of meat at the same time that I am sorry there is the suffering of killing in the world. When I eat meat I do so in recognition that Samsara is a terrible place. Also, when I eat vegetables I likewise am aware of the many millions of creatures killed every day to bring nice vegetables to my table.

I do not feel guilty for the acts committed by others. If there was no meat in the markets, I would not eat it and I would not miss it for a second.

Anyway, the point is not sending sentient beings to a pure realm, the point is creating a connection so that sentient beings meet the Dharma.
