Think i just got an aha moment because of this. When i first got in touch with spirituality i got the books from Eckhart Tolle and afterwards some books on advaita vedanta and following satsangs on youtube. The i or ego is very stigmatized by ET and AV. It is the biggest culprit according to them and must be banished. So i got " brainwashed" and i unconsciously mix/projected it on dzogchen. If i think about it i cannot really recall dzogchen to be so talkative about the ego, it just says to not grasp or reject any phenomena. So probably this also goes with the ego, to let things be as it is, no grasping or aversion/not accepting or rejecting. If this is correct what i say, than it is a fundamental difference in practice between contemporary non duality circles and dzogchen.

Malcolm wrote:
People have fetishized anatman to an impractical degree.

Innate self-grasping is the cause of samsara, suffering, and every thing else, but the solution to this is not an intellectual rejection of conventional truth. It’s is to reflect deeply on dependent origination and penetrate it’s true meaning. For that, the Rice Seedling Sutra is exemplary: https://read.84000.co/translation/toh210.html#UT22084-062-010-section-1

When you read and understand this, you will understand why the basis is personal, why it is not a self, and why dependent origination is natural perfection.

is that lhun grub is said it can manifest anything whatsoever, so why can't it manifest "something" which is not regocnizable as kadag lhungrub and thus buddhahood ends. For some unclear reason(s) "something" has already happened, why can't that happen again? I can think about an analogy from a scientific viewpoint wherein the physical universe is ending in the big freeze and thus the start of a new big bang. Couldn't something similar happen when the last sentient being reaches buddhahood?

Malcolm wrote:
This touches on one of the difficult points of Dzogchen, but basically, Longchenpa says there is no end to sentient beings because there are always latent sentient beings to populate a new universe.

Lhun grub, natural perfection, like dependent origination, is not external. It is a generic quality only of one's mind. Lhun grub is not a field like space/time. Unfortunately, this point is not well understood by most western translators of Dzogchen texts who continue to treat the term "basis" is if it were a transpersonal field.

Occam's razor suggests the opposite, that the Jonang lineage absorbed the three postures after the 17 tantras became more widespread in the 12th century, since Chegom Nagpo had many disciples.

No. I see no evidence of such postures in Lama Dampa's commentaries on the six yogas, and he was in the line of people who received the six limb yoga tradition in the lineage of Thuje Tsondru. He discusses both the yoga of the night and the day in his Tsembupa Avalokiteśvara dmar khrid.

To really resolve this, more evidence will be needed. I believe Kunpang Thukje Tsondru's Kālacakra practice manual may be out there somewhere, but I don't know much about it.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, it is in dbu med ( https://legacy.tbrc.org/#!rid=W1CZ1300 ), but in reality, this is also not conclusive since he is a 13th century master, who very likely himself received Dzogchen teachings since he taught both Nyingma and Sarma tantras. You would have to have them transposed into dbu chen.

There is no evidence of these three postures in the short six yoga text Kongtrul includes in the gdams ngag mdzod. Also the ten signs of the day and night practice, from a Dzogchen point of view, are mind and not ye shes. So there is that as well.

And the point Dudjom makes is that after one experiences a multicolored thigle, then one drops this, and moves on to the limbs of dhyāna, prāṇāyama, and so forth. And finally, it is only when one gets to the full development of the black pattern in the limb of samādhi after the vāyus have been forced into the central channel and so on, that one perceives the six realms and so on and various buddhaforms. I would agree however, that this stage is basically the same as rig pa tshad phebs, since it is in the limb of samādhi that, according to Kunpang, one attains the path of seeing. The third vision similarly is where one attains the path of seeing in Dzogchen, if one is a rim gyi pa, and not a cig car ba.

I never stated that Kalacakra was not an effective path which leads to the same result. It just takes more effort since it is a path based on mind and not ye shes, as the progress through the ten signs and so on clearly indicate.

Fascinating! So the Dzogchen critique of Kālacakra is basically the same as the Kālacakra critique of Dzogchen (as offered by Tāranatha). That each of the respective practices don't get to the actual, most subtle nāḍīs, vāyus, and bindus.

Does this summary sound correct to you:

Dzogchen and Kālacakra both agree that wisdom engaged with emptiness gives rise to visions, but disagree on (a) how this is best done and (b) what to do with the visions.

In Dzogchen teachings, the distinction isn't ye shes, the distinction is what is termed the cakṣutattva, which is defined as the undeluded aspect of the eye sense organ.

Kālacakra saḍaṅgayoga, he says, is superior because there are no fabricated combinations: after practicing the unique preliminaries (i.e., Kālacakra wen-sum), you allow the empty forms to manifest, and then successively mix them with mind, prāna, bindus, etc. to de-materialize the body and attain buddhahood in one single, coherent, sequential, process.

This is basically no different than how Sachen describes attaining the wisdom body in his Cakrasamvara commentaries.

Interesting. In what text? The dematerialization due to mixing with empty forms is fairly unique to Kālacakra as far as I know. Is he perhaps relying on the Vajrapani-stotratika, which interprets the Cakrasamvara in light of the Kālacakra?
No, he is relying on the oral traditon of the so-called gsang mtha' tradition which comes through Mal Lotsawa from Naropa. He discusses this in his rims bzhi gyi gdams ngag, vol. kha, 163 line 1-2,  where he states, "Since the entire body up to the crown is filled with ultimate bodhicitta, there is the nonconceptual connate joy, and since all phenomena are seen as empty, an immaculate bliss arises simultaneously. The path mahāsukhakāya arises on one's continuum, the bindu of the mother's blood travels to the solar maṇḍala below the feet, and the body becomes like a rainbow. The bindu of the father's śukra becomes a crescent moon on the crown, and the physical body (lus) transforms into a body of gnosis."

Plus, although the origins of the practice are murky, it's probably the case that tögal derives from Kālacakra anyways, according to Germano and others.

Malcolm wrote:
There really isn't enough time between the introduction of Kalacakra in 1027 and time of Dzeng Dharmabodhi (1052-1168) and Chetsun Senge Wangchuk (circa 1040-1120), the two main promulgators of klong sde and man ngag sde respectively, for it to have had any influence on Dzogchen at all, especially considering the likely date of revelation of 17 tantras and ancillary material, circa 1030-1040.

stong gzugs said:
I get your timeline arguments and think there's a lot of value in this approach. What is the earliest reliably dated text that explicitly mentions the tögal visions?

Malcolm wrote:
The terms trekcho and thogal get used in the seventeen tantras. They can't be dated earlier their appearance with Dangma, and we do not know exactly when he handed them over the Senge Wangchuk, all we know is that it was in the decade after Atisha passed in 1054. They also get used in the klong gsal rab 'byams rgyud, which is considered by some to be the root tantra of klong sde.

Still not enough time to create the elaborate system of Dzogchen teachings present in the seventeen tantras.

However, tradition maintains that Dangma also transmitted a an unwritten snyan brgyud to Senge Wangchuk which the former received from Drom Rinchenbar, who in turn received it from Be Lodo Wangchuk, who received from Nyang Tinzin Zangpo. This aural lineage is much simplified compared to the "dpe" or "bshad", text or explanatory lineage. It does not mention the four visions, nor the postures, and has a presentation of six lamps and it does mention the key point of the channel of luminosity connecting the heart center to the eyes, and the resultant experiential unfolding of awakening in this life, the bardo of dharmatā and so on, and thus is considered to be equivalent with Dzogchen Nyingthik by Longchenpa. It's textual basis is the Thig le kun gsal and Thig le kun 'dus tantras found in the secret cycle. Senge Wangchuk split the lineage, and gave the aural lineage to a person named Shongpa Repa, and the text lineage to Che Gom Nagpo. They were reunited in Kumaraja, and the latter passed them both on to Longchenpa. The second volume of the Zabmo Yangthig is entirely devoted to this aural lineage, and three texts devoted to it form the concluding instructional texts in the Lama Yangthig.

Plus, as above there is klong sde, which has an entirely seperate lineage

My hunch (and I think Germano's as well) is that the notion of dzogchen originated as an experience during completion stage deity practice but then gradually became its own sort of standalone radical "no-need-to-practice" practice (per Van Shaik), but eventually started taking on practices

Malcolm wrote:
No. Manjuśrīkīrti, in the Śrīsarvaguhyavidhigarbhālaṃkāra, late 10th century, explicitly identifies Śrī Simha among other figures later associated with Padmasambhava (Bhikṣuni Nandi, etc.) as belonging to a faction that rejected the need for the creation stage altogether. So, on this point, Germano and others are completely wrong. And when one examines the so-called five early sems sde texts, their (qualified) rejection of creation stage ritualism, etc., bears witness to Manjuśrīkīrti's polemic. Also, when looking at Nubchen, we find the same trend. So no, Germano and co. are wrong. Tsongkhapa even goes so far as to identify this passage in his Stages of Mantra when he argues the need for a balanced approach of the two stages, but Yarnell was too tentative to declare that dpal gyi seng ge was actually  Śrī Simha.




one of which was the first two yogas from Kālacakra, dropped all the sexual yogas and imagery (which was already being questioned for its appropriateness for monastics), didn't do any of the "mixing" yogas with the empty forms, but stayed with observing them, and found different experiences emerged when the visions are observed but not mixed with mind, prana, bindus, etc. and this became tögal. This isn't even necessarily all that discrepant from the Kālacakra perspective, because as Kālacakrapada the Elder said in his sadangayoga instruction, the most advanced practitioners can realize mahamudra through the first two yogas alone, and don't need the rest. But, in the tradition, I don't know of any claims of people who practiced on the first two.

I did some searching on this forum to make sure I'm not rehashing old conversations and found https://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?p=210269&hilit=entopic#p210269 where you seem to agree. I'd be curious about whether your perspective has changed since then?

Of course there are differences in the two systems, but it is my present opinion (which could change tomorrow based on some reliably datable text) that it is unlikely that thogal developed until after the Kalacakra was introduced to Tibet (1027). My speculation is that these entopic visions were given a context by the elaborate internal anatomy presented in Kalacakra, and this was further developed by yogis in Dzogchen circles.

I said that they exist as potential, but not fully formed, just in the same way there is a potential in a seed to produce a huge tree, but without the right conditions, that potential will never manifest. You are basically claiming the tree, with its leaves, branches, fruit, and so on, exist already that tiny seed. That is a confusion between the basis and the result. The Dzogchen critique of the basis being lhun grub, the first of the six incorrect positions of basis, exactly addresses this Saṃkhya error. You can read what Longchenpa says about this in the Tshig don mdzod, or in Buddhahood in this Life.

Malcolm wrote:
So it depends on what buddha nature metaphors we prefer. You prefer the seed that is developed by the path, I prefer the buried treasure that is revealed by the path. Dölpopa has his explanations for why the path is still needed, even if the basis and the fruit are the same, and I have pointed others to the relevant sections if they'd like to read more. No need to delve further into this (and the related points about whether jnana is self- vs. other-empty), it's well-trodden territory by now.
The Dzogchen tantras, as well as the commentaries attributed to Vimalmitra, Nyibum, and Longchenpa all reject the idea that basis and the result are the same.

In Candrakīrti's definition of the two truths, ultimate truth is the object of a veridical cognition. It is defined from the subject's side, not the object.

There is no evidence to support Dharmaśrī's contention, actually. Albion Butter's mongraph on the grub mtha' mdzod addresses this issue at length.

If people become attached to lhun grub through thinking the visions are real or ultimate, they will block their practice. But it also because gzhan stong falls into the error of asserting the basis is only lhun grub, not the union of ka dag and lhun grup, aka, ka dag chen po. One locus classicus for this is the Six Dimensions Tantra

Dharmatā free from proliferation is originally pure;
it is the basis of an intrinsically pure nature;
it is free from words and syllables;
it cannot be confirmed through expression;
it is free from all conventional reification;
it is without concepts of apprehended objects and apprehending subjects;
it is without buddhas and without sentient beings;
it is without phenomena and without perception of phenomena;
no one, no thing, nothing at all.
When the essence of such nonexistence
is confirmed with some words:
the essence is original purity
and the nature is natural perfection.

--Six Dimensions Tantra

And:


All phenomena of the basis must be recognized as essence, nature,
and compassion. All phenomena of the essence must be recognized
as empty. All phenomena of the nature must be recognized as clarity.
All phenomena of compassion must be recognized as all-pervasive.
--The Mind Mirror of Vajrasattva Tantra

So, gzhan stong is not compatible with Dzogchen, though many have tried to reconcile the two.

Thanks for coming around. Now out of the details and back to the big picture, are you attempting to claim that mandalas, mantras, initiations, goddesses, consorts, subtle anatomy (revelant to the OP such as utkranti/phowa, candali, etc.) are indigenous developments of buddhism that happen to coincidently find parallels in saiva cults? Scholarship of the last few decades show that is certainly not the case. All of these are borrowings from saiva scriptures and cults into buddhism.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, in fact abhiṣekas are mentioned in sūtras such as the Lanka, Avatamska, etc., for example, the Abhiṣeka of a bodhisattva on the verge of the elventh bhumi. Abhiṣeka is a vedic rite, as other common Buddhist practices such homa vidhi, etc., from where they are certainly derived. Mantras are part and parcel of Indian culture, also found in the Vedas and the Buddha mentions the Gayatri in the Pali Canaon, so not Śaivaite. The anatomy of the body in the Buddhist tantras depends on Ayurveda. Also descriptions of nāḍīs is found in the Upanishads, the Candogya to be specific, as are also the idea of vāyus. Prāṇayāma was common practice amongst everyone, etc.

I had a discussion with Shaman Hatley (a specialist in Śaiva tantras, you should read his thesis, you will find it interesting: https://media.proquest.com/media/hms/ORIG/2/kmBHH?_s=C5LUzKB4%2F3sb51AIqrc2CffGooY%3D ), about this, and one key difference between the Buddhist and Śaiva approach to nāḍīs, vāyus, and bindus, is the complete disregard in the Śaiva literature to the formation of the body.

But in such sūtras as the Garbhavikranti sūtras, and so on, there are vāyus for every stage of gestation, as well as detailed presentations of the development of the human body in mother tantras, etc., all of which are based on such texts as the Carakasaṃhita, and the later Aṣṭaṅgahridayasaṃhita  by the Buddhist author, Vagbhata.

Moreover, the concept of "bindu" in the Guhyasamāja tantras is not the same at all as the concept of bindu in the mother tantras.

Frankly, the usual Buddhist comparison for caṇḍalī yoga, etc., and conduct appealing to those who follow Śiva is not drawn from Śaiva scriptures, but rather a famous passage found in the Upanishad, Brihadāranyaka 6:2:13:

Additionally, Gautama, women is the fire,
her private place is the fire pit
her pubic hair is the smoke,
entering into that is fuel.
her sexual fluids are the spark;
in such a fire as that,
a man burns the seed of the gods—
from that a man emerges.

Sonam Tsemo cites this passage in his 12th century General Presentation of Tantras. He states:

"As such, also those become causes for falling into evil destinies since [such practices] are not connected with the two kinds of selflessness and the special skill in means of great compassion, etc. As such, since it is necessary to have practices agreeable for them to follow, anuttarayogatantra is taught to convert them.

Thus, I think it is a complete overstatement to insist that all these Buddhist yogas necessarily come from Śaivism, especially, as Mallinson recently proved, Hatha Yoga is based on a Buddhist text called the Amṛtasiddhi attributed to a Virupa, likely the student of Lakṣminkāra, not Śrī Virupa of Lamdre fame.

The sources of the development of Vajrayāna are hetrogenous and complex, a far more complicated issue than Sanderson's simplistic reductionism would have one believe.

Big Red Book said:
Tāranatha's Critique of Dzogchen. What you state (that the empty forms aren't developed in Kālacakra) is basically the inverse of why Tāranatha says that Mahāmudrā and Dzogchen (while superior to other practices, like conceptual meditations) are nonetheless limited practices. In fact, he says they should be described as a "nominal" completion stage rather than the actual completion stage, in part, because they are fabricated combinations of two different causes, each having a (1) non-conceptual meditation combined with (2) tummo, karmamudra, tögal, etc. He compares it to how a single solid beam can better support a home than a bunch of plant stalks tied together.

Malcolm wrote:
The Dzogchen critique is that the mahāyoga tantras, including Kālacakra, rely on relative nāḍīs, vāyus, and bindus.

Big Red Book said:
Kālacakra saḍaṅgayoga, he says, is superior because there are no fabricated combinations: after practicing the unique preliminaries (i.e., Kālacakra wen-sum), you allow the empty forms to manifest, and then successively mix them with mind, prāna, bindus, etc. to de-materialize the body and attain buddhahood in one single, coherent, sequential, process.

Malcolm wrote:
This is basically no different than how Sachen describes attaining the wisdom body in his Cakrasamvara commentaries.

Big Red Book said:
Plus, although the origins of the practice are murky, it's probably the case that tögal derives from Kālacakra anyways, according to Germano and others.

Malcolm wrote:
No, I don't think so. Why? Because there is also klong sde and yang ti. These have very separate lineages, they also deal with dharmatā pratyakṣa. It is more likely that, in the case of man ngag sde that the basis of the man ngag sde tantras is an aural lineage connected with Vimalamitra, just as kpong sde is the aural lineage connected with Vairocana, and both of them were disciples of Śrī Simha.

There really isn't enough time between the introduction of Kalacakra in 1027 and time of Dzeng Dharmabodhi (1052-1168) and Chetsun Senge Wangchuk (circa 1040-1120), the two main promulgators of klong sde and man ngag sde respectively, for it to have had any influence on Dzogchen at all, especially considering the likely date of revelation of 17 tantras and ancillary material, circa 1030-1040. Dangma Lungyal gave the 17 tantras to Senge Wangchuk in the decade after Atisha's passing, and had held onto them for 30 years, meaning he had them by 1034 at the latest, by my estimate. Tashi Dorje's dates, which are a bit inaccurate, would push the date of Senge Wangchuk's rainbow body back to 1030, but since it is clear in the accounts that he met Dangma after Atisha's passing in 1054, this isn't possible.

This is supported by the analogies of buddha-nature of the treasure buried in the backyard of a poor person, the statue with rags covering it, etc. All the buddha qualities are fully formed.

And thus, as Chogyal Namkhai Norbu explained repeatedly, gzhan stong and Dzogchen are incompatible.

stong gzugs said:
Mipham says exactly the same thing as Dölpopa here, is his view also incompatible with Dzogchen?

The primordial endowment of qualities such as the powers are spontaneously present by nature from the beginning [like] the quality of a functional knife to cut, the quality of a clear mirror to shine reflected forms, and the quality of a gem to be luminous and bestow desires; however, they are like the knife in a sheath, the mirror put in the box, and the gem covered with mud. When the obscurations are cleared, the qualities do not newly arise, but appear manifest as if newly arisen.

Malcolm wrote:
The removal of taints is a condition for the appearance of naturally perfected qualities. Lhun grub does not really mean "spontaneously present." Lhun grup is a translation of anabhoga/nirabhoga, which means "effortless," which is attested in Mipham's Sanskrit glossary in the Vajrayāna section. In other words, when taints are removed, qualities manifest naturally, without effort. The example given is like a crystal-- normally, it is clear, but when held in the light, it projects a spectrum. We can say that the potential to project a spectrum exists as a potential, but only manifests under certain conditions. Also Drakpa Gyaltsen points out with respect to qualities being naturally perfected, natural perfection and transformation are non-contradictory. According to your view, the crystal will always be project a specturm whether there is light or not.

stong gzugs said:
But I wouldn't deny someone like you who thinks they're created.

Malcolm wrote:
I didn't say they were created. I said that they exist as potential, but not fully formed, just in the same way there is a potential in a seed to produce a huge tree, but without the right conditions, that potential will never manifest. You are basically claiming the tree, with its leaves, branches, fruit, and so on, exist already that tiny seed. That is a confusion between the basis and the result. The Dzogchen critique of the basis being lhun grub, the first of the six incorrect positions of basis, exactly addresses this Saṃkhya error. You can read what Longchenpa says about this in the Tshig don mdzod, or in Buddhahood in this Life.

Related to the above, I'd just call readers to read for themselves Mathes' 2001 https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/download/9175/3033 and I think most would come to the same conclusion I did: that Taranatha's reading is logically consistent and one valid reading of many. I agree with Mathes that his argument wouldn't work without the Ratnagatravibhāga clearly supporting the gzhanstong view:
There is nothing to be removed from it / And nothing to be added.
The real should be seen as real / And seeing the real / You become liberated.
The [buddha] element is empty of the adventitious / Which are by definition separable.
But, it is not empty of the unsurpassable qualities / Which are by definition not separable.
Ratnagotravibhāga 1.154–55

Malcolm wrote:
If someone realizes the emptiness of all things, then of course, one will also naturally produce all qualities of realization, just as when the sunlight hits water vapor it projects a spectrum, a rainbow. You can't say that water vapor's potential to project a spectrum is alienable. You also can't say that the water vapor will always produce a spectrum when there is no light, or the light is not shining in the correct way, or one is not standing in the correct place.

stong gzugs said:
I don't, I think that's how the Geluk interpret Prajñāpāramita: as a non-affirming negation. And Kālacakra explicitly denies that its emptiness is that type of non-affirming negation (e.g., as arrived at by analyzing things into their parts and finding nothing). Tāranatha, in his commentary on the Heart Sutra, interprets prajñāpāramita differently as the wisdom that realizes the emptiness of the skandas, but which is not itself that emptiness. Hence, gzhanstong.

Malcolm wrote:
If the jñāna that realizes the emptiness of the skandhas isn't also empty, it cannot function as jñāna, because uncompounded entities cannot function at all:

For those whom emptiness is possible, for them everything is possible.
For those whom emptiness is not possible, for them nothing is possible.
MMK

But that does not mean one's consciousness (shes pa, jñā) does not have the possibility to realize emptiness of itself and everything. That is part of its potential. That potential is inalienable to consciousness, but if it isn't empty itself, free from all extremes, it cannot never realize that potential. A mirror always has the ability to reflect, that potential is inalienable to a mirror, but that does not mean the mirror is not also empty.

If there were something subtle that was not empty, there would be something subtle to be empty;
but as there is nothing that is not empty, where is there something to be empty?
MMK

This is why the actual view of Dzogchen is "free from extremes, totally complete" ( mtha' dang bral ba yongs du rdzogs pa ).


stong gzugs said:
Also, the Jonang didn't invent the three turnings heuristic. The Jonang heuristic is that of the four yugas that emphasize the Three Cycles of Bodhisattva Commentaries as the golden age dharma.

Also just a gimmick. Our gimmick is that Dzogchen is the first Dharma that was ever taught in this mahākalpa by the nirmāṇakāya Khye'u Nangwa Dampa during the first eon of the mahākalpa, arising from the dharmakāya of the last buddha of the previous mahākalpa.

(This is a summary article of a much longer book that provides further proof).

Brunnhölzl said:
Among modern scholars, it seems to be generally accepted that Dol po pa was the first one to use the terms rang stong and gzhan stong in a systematic and extensive way and widely propagated the gzhan stong system ... However, as shown above, at least in terms of the contents, if not the name, there clearly were Indian and Tibetan precursors who discussed crucial elements of what came to be called the gzhan stong view, though they did not use that term and did not necessarily give full-fledged or systematic presentations of gzhan stong as found in later Tibetan works. Therefore, it seems to be justified to refer to the authors of the Bṛhaṭṭīkā and the Āmnāyānusāriṇī, Sajjana, and Ratnākaraśānti as Indian forerunners of “Great Madhyamaka” as an equivalent of the gzhan stong view. The same applies to Btsan kha bo che and Smon lam tshul khrims as early Tibetan examples of this view before Dol po pa.

Malcolm wrote:

Correct, Indian "gzhan stong" is just the false aspectarian yogacāra of Ratnakāraśanti, as Rongton and Gorampa point out, which I mentioned above. Which means the gzhan stong is Tibet is just a riff on false aspectarian yogacāra.

By the way, everyone calls their own madhyamaka "great." The first to use the term in Tibet was Kawa Paltseg, Vimalamitra's student.

Malcolm wrote:
Appropriation is not "influence," it's a deliberate seizure.

And Guhyasamāja lacks the subjugtion of Maheśvara myth, which is central the Laghusamvara tradition, and the subjugation of the worldly gods central to the Hevajra myth.

Guhyasamāja does not rest on a corpse of anyone, and has more in common with the yoga tantras than the yogini tantras. As for antinomian practices, these are also found in lower tantras, but they are not specifically Śaivaite in form, and have more in common Mimamsa ritualism.

Padmavajra's text is written after the yogini tantras were widespread, since he quotes several of them.

Aveśa is not possession. It is used in every initiation after the guru has instructed the students how to generate themselves as a given deity. He then instructs the students to visualize the jñānasattva of the deity entering their generation as samayasattvas. This is not "possession." This is a yoga.

Reindeer Milk said:
…The passage contains a set of instructions in which a Buddhist sādhaka is essentially told to disguise himself as a Śaiva ascetic in order to deceive a community of outcastes into giving him one of their daughters as tribute in exchange for a fake Śaiva maṇḍala initiation. It would seem logical to pause and examine the reasons that a Vajrayāna Buddhist ascetic performing the caryā and vrata might be told to disguise himself as one of any number of Śaiva ascetic orders, particularly given the fact that the later, standardized versions of these practices in the yoginītantras are widely hypothesized as Buddhist appropriations of forms of Śaiva asceticism.

Malcolm wrote:
I still don't buy Sanderson's reading of the passage, for example, he alters dharma and siddhanta, when the Sanskrit and the Tibetan are clear. It reads more clearly as a conversion method than a method of defrauding poor people of their daughter.

Sanderson's claim is that this wandering guy, who dresses up with the accouterments of Heruka, is just trying to trick these poor folks by acting as a Śaiva guru. I agree one could read it this way, but I remain unconvinced this is actually what is happening in this passage. The problem is that there is no commentary on this text, and as is often the case in these texts, what one thinks is happening when read literally, is not what is intended at all.

Incidentally, one cannot engage in this vratacārya until one has generated strong heat on the path of application. One of the key points of the tale of Kṛṣnācarya is that he is keen to enter into vratcārya before he is ready, disobeys Jalandrapāda, and so he experiences many obstacles.

I also never disputed the idea that the Yogini tantras appropriated Śaiva forms, that was not the point of my objection. I mentioned that Buddhists deliberately taught the various classes of tantras in order to convert various casts to Buddhism.

As to Krug's point, Virupa passed as a sadhu, and often in those days one could not distinguish whether a yogi was Buddhist or Hindu, as illustrated by Virupa's encounter with the King of Varanasi. Later, Virupa was appointed the head pandita by another king because his superb knowlege of Sanskrit, until people figured out that he was paying homage to the PP in 8000 lines, and not the Śiva linga. Later in the tale, Śiva is becomes a disciple of Virupa, in order to prevent the latter from destroying the Somanātha linga.  One could argue, following Krug, that Virupa used deception and dissimulation to gain access to elites in order to convert them through feats of magic.

What's missing in all these accounts of the Yogini tantras is that this was a deliberate, self-conscious method of conversion employed by Buddhists, a deliberate program for appropriation and conversion. From a sociological POV, that's obvious.

Vajrasattva in the form of the sattvavajrīmudrā thus enters into the student as he drinks the water. “In order for the jñāna to enter, […]” concludes Śākyamitra in his commentary, “[…] the sattvavajrīmudrā is positioned in the student’s heart, and the heart[-mantra] is recited.”7 As Śākyamitra, explains, this is the crucial moment of entry (Skt. āveśa), when the buddhas’ jñāna enters inside the disciple for the first time.

I doubt if you have received these ZZNG teachings...

Malcolm wrote:
I received teachings on ZZNG from Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, as well having received the entire cycle from Chapur Rinpoche in person. I have it next to me at my desk, I consult it often.

For example, in the Commentary on the Six Lamps, Ornament of Sunlight, it states:


Since the essence of the basis of all (kun gzhi) is empty and lacks identity (bdag med), it is called "The dimension (klong) of great emptiness." Because there are no phenomena (bon) such as samsara, nirvana, and so on, that do not arise from that dimension, "everything arises."

Or,

"The trio of mother, child, and potential (rtsal)" means that in the dharmatādhātu (bon nyid kyi dbying), the mother, the basis of all (kun gzhi), is empty and lacks identity; in the pristine consciousness of the mind essence (sems nyid), the child, cognizance (rig pa), is intrinsically clear and without grasping; the nonduality of the mother and child in the mind (blo) is called "potential."


There are many such statements in the Tibetan text of the ZZNG, which I read in Tibetan.

Just accept that you don't understand these teachings as well as you claim, keep studying, and practicing. You will get it eventually. Even better, learn Tibetan.

I am not saying this to be mean, but frankly, the Bonpo Geshes are not teaching their tenet systems in detail. I have the entire curriculum of Bonpo teachings from Abhidharma to ZZNG and everything in between. What non-Tibetan students receive from them is ZZNG, and other Dzogchen cycles, and useful rituals, but no education in Bonpo Madhyamaka, Perfection of Wisdom, Abhidharma, etc. All of these are completely present in the Bon school and are very interesting. But sadly, they are not being taught.

When considering Vajrayāna, I think this focus on Saiva ritualism is excessively myopic.

For example, the Guhyasamāja, Mahāvairocana-abhisambodhi, Susiddhikara, Sarvatatathāgatatattvasamgraha, Vajraśikara, etc. owe nothing to the Saiva tradition at all, as far as I can discern.

Reindeer Milk said:
They certainly do. Sanderson touches on Guhyasamaja in this excerpt from his Saiva Age:


The Guhyasamaja: copulating deities, sexual initiation rites, and the sacralization of impurity said:
A further borrowing from the Vidyapıtha is evident in the introduction of a crucial element of what that tradition calls ‘non-dualistic practice’ (advaitacarah) and both traditions call ‘practice free of inhibition’(nihsankacarah), namely the offering to the deities of such ‘impure’ substances as urine, faeces, semen, and blood, and their sacramental consumption.

That Tantric Buddhists possessed the specialized knowledge of the Saiva Mantramarga that would enable them to draw at will on the Saiva Tantras in this period is placed beyond doubt by an early exegetical work in the tradition of the Guhyasamaja. For this, the Guhyasiddhi of Padmavajra, written in all probability in the eighth century, assumes that any initiate in the practice of this Tantra is not only familiar with the Saiva scriptures but is able to enact their rituals by assuming the role of a Saiva Guru, implying thereby that such initiates were typically converts from the Mantramarga with experience both of its texts and of its practices. For it tells the adept of this tradition that in order to acquire the female consort required for his post-initiatory observance he should enter the home of a family of untouchables who are observant devotees of Siva, reveal to them one of the Saiddhantika scriptures—the text specifically mentions the Kalottara and the Nisvasa—give them Mandala initiation [following this scripture], and then return to them the daksina that they will give him, taking a girl from them in its place.


Malcolm wrote:
Ok, this is an error. First, the text makes no such mention of such a procedure. It can't possibly be from the 7th century, since Padmavajra cites the Hevajra Tantra, the Yoginisaṃcarya, and other ninth century texts. It also does not cite the Guhyasamaja.


The Sarvatathagatattvasamgraha and the First Inroads of Sakta Saivism: Possession, Goddesses, and the Sacralization of Sex said:
Here we find for the first time the requirement that candidates enter a state of possession (avesah) at the time of their initiation...

…The second is the incorporation of sexual intercourse...



Malcolm wrote:
Again, this is just Sanderson's complete lack of understanding of Vajrayāna. It is clear he does not understand what he is reading.

"Avesa" is not possession, it's a summoning of the jñānasattva. There is no sexual union in the text at all.

What Rinpoche said is very correct and his presentation emphasizes in the rigpa. The clear light mind has different methods on which those texts are focused on. Even though they (clear light mind and rigpa) are essential same, but they have different approach of the path (i.e. how to proceed).

Then, one may have impression of my words that this clear light is depended on the outer bodhicitta (semen). That is not what I am presenting. It is the skillful method of harnessing such and such things. Both systems have different approach. For example, one focused on cessation of dualistic thoughts/concepts by using certain channels. In another, one tries to recognize it while there are thoughts.

The great fool, who seeks for worldly impermanent bliss, still does not find it. But the wise will cast way even the attainment of bliss of empire for liberation. So, it is the different approach.

There are some research papers about what happens during the ejaculation (i.e. Neurons for Ejaculation). It is not just mere casting way the wastage product; there are whole physiological processes.

It is suggested that one should stop practicing for few days if one is fulfilling household duty in Chinese energetic practice or esoteric martial art.  Otherwise, you tear down those tendons related to these practices. People do not understand, to whom it is suggested, why it is suggested, when it is suggested, etc. They come with all kinds of label.

In Nepal today, for instance, there are plenty of non-Buddhist rituals which continue to be adopted by Buddhists, but then need reinterpretation to make sense within a Buddhist framework. Mock-marriage to the Bilba fruit is one example, where Hindus see the fruit as Viṣṇu, Buddhists say it is Bodhicitta—this does not have historical textual precedent, but if composition of religious literature was as active as it was a thousand years ago, one might imagine Sanskrit ritual texts being composed on the matter. Cāryā dance is also something which has sub-continental non Buddhist-Tantric precedents, but has taken on great importance in Tantric Buddhism in Nepal, starting with Buddhist refugees from Bengal. It is known, and indeed there might be some evidence, that this practice, along with dāphā song, can be extremely powerful, and it is this perception of power that makes the practice so attractive for anyone. There is trans-sectarian perception of power, and so we do see Buddhists continuing to go to non-Buddhist teachers to receive teachings for particular purposes or because they are reputed to be powerful. When these are transmitted to one's own students, one of course must frame it within a consistent framework of what one has taught before, which still balancing faithfulness to the original transmission one received from one's non-Buddhist guru.

I think this is not really an issue for a well-practiced Buddhist āchārya, who can easily activate visions of yantras and buddhas, but for the average western practitioner, who may also be well-read, it might be hard to wrap one's mind around these issues in a way that makes sense.

What they say in fact is that vijñāna transforms into jñāna. They don't say that vijñāna is absolute. The problem they have is an inner contradiction in explaining how something compounded becomes uncompounded. Dolbupa tries to escape this issue by declaring at the outset that vijñāna and jñana are different entirely. That leads to a whole other set of problems, none of which are satisfactorily addressed by repurposing Shantipa's scheme of mapping the three natures to the two truths.
For example, if this jñāna is uncompounded, it must exist fully formed in a person from the beginning, which means they ought to have access to the dual omniscience of the result, and so on ... In any case, if these mantras, deities, and mandala are without a cause, then there is no need for a path, much less a result.

Malcolm wrote:
Again, this is the difference between Dzogchen and gzhan stong. For Dzogchen, Lamdre, etc., the "qualities" exist only as a potential, to say they exist fully formed is contradicts the fact that afflicted sentient beings do not experience the eighteen unshared qualities of a buddha, etc.

I think Mathes soundly supports my original claim that "Taranatha's reading of the Madhyāntavibhāga is logically consistent. I'm not claiming it's the only valid reading, just that it is a valid reading." I recognize that it's a novel interpretation. I'm just claiming that it's logically sound. But I'll leave that for the other readers to decide:

Mathes, K.-D. (2001). Tāranātha’s presentation of trisvabhāva in the gŹan stoṅ sñiṅ po. Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies, 23(2), 195–223.

Malcolm wrote:
It is not consistent with how the Yogacāra founders and their followers understood it. Their understanding should be taken as authoritative. Not this made-up understanding which is never found in all of Asanga's credible works, and so on. That's just an academic game Mathes, Lusthause, and so on, play to keep themselves busy.

The gshan stong mapping of the three natures to the two truths, following Shantipa, is exactly why Tsongkhapa, Rongton, and Gorampa take them to task on this point, is exactly why Rongton asserts they are a variant of false aspectarian yogacāra, and is exactly why Longchenpa avoids making the same mistake that Dolbupa and other gzhan stong pas get sucked into, and is why Longchenpa is emphatically not a gzhan stong pa. He is a mtha' bral pa in the grand tradition of classical Madhyamaka, and avoided the novelties of Tibetans such as the gzhan stong system and the Geluk/Kadampa system, which actually predates Tsongkhapa by some centuries. One can find what would become caricatured as Tsongkhapa's position rebutted in Rongzom.

The tathāgatagarbha doctrine is perfectly acceptable to Madhyamaka, but not if one divides the two truths from each other, as it is done in gzhan stong. In this respect (dividing the two truths), Geluk and gzhan stong are just mirror images of each other, hence Khenpo Appey said that Geluk was just upside down gzhan stong. Also, for this reason, Longchenpa declares the view of Candrakīrti to be the definitive Mahāyāna view, while at same time declaring the ten tathāgatagarbha sūtras to be the definitive Mahāyāna sūtras (though even he got sucked into the dumb hermeneutic).

All the contradictions the dumb hermeneutic creates are pointed out by Sonam Tsemo in his General Presentation of the Tantras. He quotes the remedy for them from the Explication of the Intent Tantra (Sandhivyākaraṇanāmatantra. Dgongs pa lung bstan pa zhes bya ba'i rgyud.

That's why when I read that by Gorampa, I lost all interest in further study of Madhyamaka debates by Tibetans. And, there is no Indian gzhan stong at all.

Is it said that such a person does not remember their previous lifetime immediately as a first bhumi bodhisattva/stream enterer, and they do not consciously have the cognitive structure in place that says "I am a Buddhist who has realized the nature of mind", but rather they just have a certain tendency towards renunciation of samsara and towards virtue, which may lead to re-recognition of dharmata in that particular bodymind?

I do not know what type of impression is given by above description. If you said so, then you are correct. Probably, I had given an example, too.  I did not say that space is inside the cloud, nor suggested that space is just a quality of cloud. I have not studied that much so I have no idea about what Jigme Lingpa's criticism is about.

Malcolm wrote:
Rig pa, vidyā is defined in the commentaries of the 17 tantras as knowledge of one's core potential (cittatilaka). When one has this knowledge, then there is possibility of buddhahood. Without it, buddhahood is not possible.

It is also defined as pratyātmavedanajñāna.

Here are a couple of other useful aspects to consider from the Vima snying thig:

(1) The vidyā that apprehends characteristics: “the vidyā that imputes phenomena as universals and as mere personal names”, is one’s mere non-conceptual self-cognizant consciousness defiled by many cognitions. 

(2) The [vidyā that] appropriates the basis creates all cognitions when present in one’s body, and is present as the mere intrinsic clarity [of those cognitions] is called “unripened vidyā.”

(3) The vidyā present as the basis is the reality of the essence, original purity, that exists possessing the three pristine consciousnesses. The vidyā which is not covered by partiality is present as the essence of omniscient pristine consciousness. Further, that pristine consciousness is present as a subtle pristine consciousness. If that pristine consciousness did not exist, there would be no liberation from emptiness. Further, there would be no liberation from the inert. However, if vidyā exists as pristine consciousness, it would be no different than the substantial nirmanakāya. 

(4) The vidyā of insight is those vivid appearances when the instruction is demonstrated. It is called “the essence of the self-appearing tilaka”. As there are many unmixed appearances, the Teacher stated:

Everything arose from non-arising,
showing the great miraculous display in every way. 

(5) The vidyā of thögal is the absence of increase or decrease in experience having reached the full measure of appearance through practice. Having completed all the signs and qualities, also they are not established by their own nature. When self-manifesting as omniscient pristine consciousness, it [the vidyā of thögal] is called “abandoning phenomena”, “the exhaustion of phenomena”, “beyond phenomena”, “liberated from phenomena”, and “no arising even in mere arising”. 

Are those vidyās different or not? They are not different since there is nothing more than a single nature.

All of these are subsumed under the term rig pa, and all have but a single nature.

Is avidyā different than vidyā? The latter is the cause of the former and becomes the former:

As such, from not recognizing that knowledge (vidyā, rig pa) and ignorance (avidyā, ma rig pa) have the same cause, like the front and back of one’s hand, the ignorance of the same identical cause arises from not arriving at ultimate nonduality. The connate ignorance (arising from the preceding) is a term of duality, meaning as soon as the conceit “this is originally pure” occurs, it is inseparable from that ignorance. Thus, ignorance depends on knowledge and delusion depends on nondelusion. As such, knowledge itself becomes ignorance and nondelusion becomes delusion.
-- Buddhahood in This Life, pg. 77.

Because people do not spend enough time studying the first two of the eleven topics of the Great Perfection, they really do not understand the view of the Great Perfection, as is clearly evident in many of the postings in this thread.

This is an incredibly silly idea...It takes a willfully ignorant misreading of Dölpopa's Mountain Dharma to think that gzhan stong has anything to do with any form of false aspectarian cittamatra/yogacara. [/quote]

I doubt Rongton wilfully misread Dolbupa. His take is that gzhan stong is an intermediate view between false aspectarian yogacāra and proper madyamaka——as I said, a riff.

As far as Tsongkhapa goes, his main arguments against gzhan stong are found in his legs bshad snying po, and mainly have to do with how gzhan stong pas incorrectly distort both the two truths doctrine and the three natures doctrine.


stong gzugs said:
False aspectarians say vijnana is absolute, gzhanstongpas say jnana is absolute.

Malcolm wrote:
What they say in fact is that vijñāna transforms into jñāna. They don't say that vijñāna is absolute. The problem they have is an inner contradiction in explaining how something compounded becomes uncompounded. Dolbupa tries to escape this issue by declaring at the outset that vijñāna and jñana are different entirely. That leads to a whole other set of problems, none of which are satisfactorily addressed by repurposing Shantipa's scheme of mapping the three natures to the two truths.

stong gzugs said:
To confuse the two means an inability to distinguish between the alaya vijnana (kunzhi namshe) and the alaya jnana (kunzhi yeshe). You're a Dzogchen practitioner, would you take seriously the critiques of somebody who can't tell the difference between sems and yeshe?

Malcolm wrote:
In Dzogchen ye she is the basis of sems; sems is the potential (rtsal) of ye shes. They are not absolutely different in kind and substance, as proposed by Dolbupa. The https://read.84000.co/translation/toh106.html#UT22084-049-001-chapter-3 chapter in the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra is useful for reviewing how dharmin and dharmatā are neither the same nor different.

For example, if this jñāna is uncompounded, it must exist fully formed in a person from the beginning, which means they ought to have access to the dual omniscience of the result, and so on. It means some permanent entity moves from one body to another, etc.

stong gzugs said:
]he refutes cittamatra on the basis of the Kālacakra, which argues that mantras, deities, and mandalas are self-arisen pristine wisdom beyond consciousness.

Malcolm wrote:
How one understands this very much depends on how one understands the grammar of the Sanskrit term "svayambhu." Some commentaries gloss is as arising without a cause; most commentaries gloss it as "arising from oneself."

In any case, if these mantras, deities, and mandala are without a cause, then there is no need for a path, much less a result. If they are beyond consciousness, they cannot be cognized by anyone since there is no faculty by which they could be perceived, unless what is being proposed is a seventh faculty outside the eighteen dhātus, never taught by the Buddha, called jñānendriya. And if this is so, just how does this faculty of jñāna arise, being uncompounded?

This is why Sakya Chogden, who bumps up against this, asserts that the jñāna which perceives the ultimate is actually relative, compounded, and so on, with an ultimate object. Yes, I am aware of Taranatha's dogmatic objections to this. The point is, that this claim of Dolbupa is exactly what causes Rendawa to assign to Dolbupa the charge that he is outside the pale of Buddhadharma. Rongton and Gorampa are nicer, with the latter finding only that bzhan stong is mildly eternalist, while Tsongkhapa is mildly annihilationist.

Taranatha's reading of the Madhyāntavibhāga is logically consistent. I'm not claiming it's the only valid reading, just that it is a valid reading.

Malcolm wrote:
It is not consistent with the foundational Yogacāra commentaries on the text, that is the commentaries by Vasubandhu and Sthiramati. Look, Mipham tries to pull a fast one by claiming that if one merely substitutes rnam par snang ba for rnam par rig pa (vijñāpti), this renders the text compatible with madhyamaka. However, this works only as a Tibetan word play, as there is no comparable Sanksrit term for rnam par snang ba. And as far as Vasubandhu goes, Ārya Vimuktisena scolds him precisely for having a consciousness-only view. So, Tsongkhapa is correct in rejecting the attribution of the Bṛhaṭṭīkā to Vasubhandu.

There are other reasons why Dolbupa's arguments might have been found wanting in this respect by Tsongkhpa as well. For example, I don't know how Dolbupa reconciles this statement from the Bṛhaṭṭīkā with his view that the perfected nature is empty of the imagined nature:

།ཆོས་ཀྱི་དབྱིངས་ཞེས་བྱ་བ་ནི། ཡོངས་སུ་གྲུབ་པའི་ཆོས་དེ་དོན་དམ་པར་ཀུན་བརྟགས་པ་དང༌། ཡོངས་སུ་གྲུབ་པ་གཉིས་ཀ་སྟོང་པའི་ངོ་བོ་ཉིད་དུ་རོ་གཅིག་སྟེ། ཐ་དད་དུ་དབྱེར་མེད་པས་གཅིག་གིས་གཅིག་མི་མཐོང་ངོ་ཞེས་བསྟན་པའོ།

The "dharmadhātu" is the perfected dharma. In the ultimate, both the imputed and the perfected are one taste in the intrinsic nature of emptiness. Since they cannot be differentiated, it is explained "one does not see the other."
f. 88a, Dg.T, sher phyin, ni (Toh. 3907).

The text goes on to explain how the dharmadhātu is the nature of the rūpadhātu (domain of matter), etc., and so on. When we read this text carefully, it does not actually appear to support the idea that the ultimate is empty of the relative. In fact, it consistently affirms that the ultimate and relative cannot be differentiated. It even goes so far as to say that holding onto pairs such as permanent/impermanent, compounded/uncompounded, empty/not empty and so on are the imputed nature. So what does this mean for Dolbupa's splitting the two truths?

The fact is that Chandrakīrti also makes use of the three natures, as does the Bodhicittavivarana Nāgārjuna (II? III?)

Unknown said:
This is a late text. Admittedly, by the 12th century alternate interpretations of the svabhava theory were emerging, but to claim this interpretation is consistent with the Yogacara founders is anachronistic at best.

I mean, in light of modern scholarship, lots of texts our lineage founders assumed were authentic or from a certain date/time/place may no longer be seen as such, so I don't know how to reconcile that.
One cannot, therefore one must stop using such texts as proof texts. If the Dharmadhātustava is not by Nāgārjuna I, one cannot use it as a proof text that Nāgārjuna I upheld some version of dhātuvāda. All one can say is that such and such a text was held by so and so to be valid. But continuing to argue that historical figures held positions they absolutely did not is just poor scholarship. Pre-modern Tibetans can be excused for not having a critical view of history. We cannot.

Unknown said:
(For instance, pretty much the entire Pali cannon came centuries after the historical Buddha; also, are we really required to believe in texts hidden under rocks or with nagas, or do we accept academic arguments that termas were ways for Nyigmas to justify the legitimacy of new texts being introduced by the "old ones"?). But we can always go back to Tsen Khawoche or Yumo Mikyo Dorje or even the earliest commentaries on the Kālackara to find that the weight of the Jordruk lineage is with Dölpopa, not Tsonghkhapa. So the Jonang continue to hold the definitive meaning of the Kālackara.

Malcolm wrote:
There are many versions of sadāṅgayoga, for example, the Sakyapas had a version. Rongzom presents a version. Further, you are just expressing sectarian preference. Jonang feels it has the definitive take on the Kalacakra sadāṅgayoga because it specialized in these yogas——but yoga and philosophy are not the same thing. According to Gorampa, when one is practicing Vajrayāna it does not matter much what kind of view one holds in post-equipoise. Everyone agrees—from Dolbupa to Gorampa to Tsongkahpa—that the view in equipoise must be free from proliferation, spros pa dang bral ba, nisprapañca.

I don't worry too much about what academics say. But when we have clear dates or epochs for the revelation of this or that text, it is impossible to say it has any influence on an earlier time.

I mean, the whole mythical narrative of Shambhala and Kalkī are taken from the Puranas. Point being, there's plenty in the Kālacakra that would (and did) make people worry about syncretism and the key reason people accepted it is because the syncretism might help attract people across various Indian traditions into the Kālacakra mandala, which is the unity you need when you're being invaded by outsiders.

Kongtrul agrees in this assessment, that the Brhattika and other texts, show Vasubandhu speaking in terms of Madhyamaka. Nobody is forcing anyone to agree with his terminologies or classifications, but Dölpopa always brought receipts for his claims. There's a reason he was known as the omniscient one.

I don't want to send this interesting thread off in a random direction, so I'll just end by coming full circle to note that Dölpopa's purpose in linking the two truths and three natures wasn't merely to explain the sutras, it was to depict the experiential realization of emptiness produced by the Kālacakra six-branch yoga, which is what Tsongkhapa didn't quite seem to grok.

Clouds are the sky’s magical creations.
Be the sky itself.

If you are happy practicing with the sun and moon,
Planets and stars are their magical creations.
Be the sun and moon.

If you are happy practicing with the mountain,
Grass and trees are the mountain’s magical creations.
Be the mountain itself.

If you are happy practicing with the ocean,
Waves are the ocean’s magical creations.
Be the ocean itself.

If you are happy practicing with mind,
Thoughts are the mind’s magical creations.
Be mind itself.

The teachings associated with each Lamp form a key point (gnad) in themselves, dealing with specific themes. Here, the teachings associated with the Lamp of the Flesh-Heart (tsitta sha’i sgron ma) actually make up what is known as the “key point of the inner arising of natural Awareness.” The Lamp of the Flesh-Heart is thus to be understood as a Base (gzhi) from which Awareness naturally arises.

I already said that the depletion of sukra dhatu or bija will decrease the inner fire.

Malcolm wrote:
Depletion means overuse. According to the Ayurveda and Tibetan Medicine, there is an excess of mdangs/ojas in the winter, so there is no danger of depletion. The reason we have this idea of seasons is because the premodern system of food production did not allow people to eat steak, all year long, food stores ran out by early spring, people start to eat bitter greens, and so on. For this reason, ojas could be depleted by excess sexual activity in early spring and summer. In any case, both in the ancient and modern context, the main source of ojas depletion is stress/vata vitiation all by itself, regardless of secondary cause.

It is major error to say sukra is waste product in term of Ayurveda. It is a main dhatu of the body (i.e. one of the seven), whereas ojas is upadhatu. One cannot increase bliss and heat without this (sukra) because of dependently arising. Even in term of Tibetan Buddhism, they practice “inner heat”, which is not different than any other non-buddhist traditions. Sukra is an indirect fuel for inner heat.

Celibacy is another thing. Vajrayana utilizes anything; it utilizes non-celibacy as well as celibacy. Meaning of celibacy for monk/nun or lay people is quite different.

Malcolm wrote:
As someone who is a doctor of Tibetan Medicine, and who studied Ayurveda in India, you are right about sukra being one of the seven main tissues of the body, but the waste product of sutra is bija, and the pure part is ojas. Ojas cultivation is the entire point of rasayana. The bija can be expelled without harm, but not the ojas.

Content:
PeterC said:
The objective when translating Dharma texts is not to be expressive but to be accurate, and with Dzogchen that means consistency in rendering of the core terminology. If you find that disappointing and want something more expressive, then there's plenty of bad but superficially poetic translations of Dzogchen texts out there - not Dowman's, but there is no shortage of inferior translators working in this field.

Zhen Li said:
Another thing to consider in translation is capacity to inspire a practitioner to practice, or to insight. Some of the best translators translate verse as verse, and do it quite well—this, inhernetly, means that accuracy is going to be lossed with a few rare exceptions where grammar and vocabulary of one line can be transposed into the grammar and vocabulary of English. E.g. Erik Pema Kunsang, sometimes Paul Harrison, most of the original PTS series, 100% of verse translated into Chinese (ever?). Translation is not just to provide someone with a map of what the original says—for someone in need of that kind of accuracy, they should just learn the source language—but to guide someone to the right action that suits their temperament.

PeterC said:
True, there are different objectives in doing a translation.  You might be attempting a poetic translation to try to capture your sense of the original.  But I think that depends on the genre a bit.  Dzogchen texts tend to have a significant didactic/technical bias even when it sounds like nice poetic language.  You see this when a lama takes what looks like a poem and explains the (at times, quite extraordinary) level of detail contained in it.  Chan/Zen poetry is a little different - I think poetic translations there are ok - but then you run into a different problem, that the original language is extremely concise, so it’s hard to match meter.

Translation is really about making choices, ultimately you can’t keep everyone happy (though it is entirely possible to get it totally wrong).  So you have to choose based on what you consider the most important function of the original text is.  I prefer translations that prioritize explaining the instructional content of a text, and that leads you down one particular path.

And a third problem arises when translators don’t explain their translations and why they chose this term over that term using some semblance of evidence-based reasoning.

The Buddha was very sexually active according every account until he was 29 or so. Then he left home. But he never expected all his followers to become renunciants. If they did, who would support the renunciant Sangha?

In any case, according to Ayurveda and Tibetan Medicine, there are times of the year when men can engage in more or less unrestricted sexual activity with their proper partners (five times a day in winter) and times of the year when they should refrain from sexual activity beyond twice a month (summer) and ratios in between (spring and fall). The reason why is that sukra is a waste product (kita) left over from the final refinement of the pure portion our food (rasa) into ojas. In the summer one is likely to lose this ojas with sukra because in the summer we tend to eat less nutritionally dense food.

Are you saying that direct perception (rigpa), of the nature of mind (mind essence, chos nyid), corresponds with an intellectual understanding that is established prior to that direct perception?

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, necessarily so:

In Dzogchen we have three main methods of transmission: oral, symbolic, and direct transmission. The first, oral transmission, implies that the teacher transmits by explaining what is the base and what is knowledge (rig pa), and how one can have that knowledge. The student listens and follows, and he or she can have at least an idea of what Dzogchen means. The oral transmission is also linked with the symbolic transmission in that in the latter some symbolic objects are used to make that knowledge understood...The third method, direct transmission, implies one already has knowledge of the oral and symbolic transmission. Through these two, one has an idea of how to enter into the real nature; then by using different experiences together and entering in that real nature at the same moment with one's teacher, there is a possibility that one receives the direct transmission. So direct transmission implies the possibility of receiving knowledge, when the student already knows how to work while the teacher transmits that knowledge."

Chogyal Namkahi Norbu, Song of the Vajra, pp.3-5. Dzogchen Community of American, 1992.

It is also explained in this way in the Dzogchen tantras and all the commentaries that touch on the subject of introduction.

Texts can make us fundamentalist, more especially if the letter is grasped. Guru awaken wisdom within so that the texts become a door to wisdom.

Guru is also inner wisdom, that shines as boddicitta reveals its presence.

Without the help of the guru principle, the texts are just letters.

Gurus are not omnipotent magical beings. They are human beings, some of them might actually be realized. Most of them are not.

The tantras described their qualities in human terms because they are humans.

The only person who awakens the wisdom within is oneself. The guru merely aids this process, as the Hevajra Tantra points out:

Here there is no method and wisdom,
the appearance of true reality
can’t be described by another,
the connate cannot be found anywhere,
but one can understand it in dependence on the Guru, 
time, method, and from one’s merit.

So, not even a guru is sufficient, there is more to it than that, which is why the question of empowerment is so crucial.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course it is something which can be comprehended intellectually, however, the actual view is a direct perception, the meaning pristine consciousness, as exemplified in this passage by Candrakīrti, "The cessation of the mind is directly perceived by the kāya."

However, on the indirect path, for example, similar to the idea the famed Khenpo Ngachung states that in the cultivation of thögal, a) the first two visions are equivalent to śamatha as concepts do arise toward the object, the visions of the pristine consciousness of one's vidyā, and that b) during this phase of the practice, it is sufficient to merely have a good intellectual grasp of emptiness. Khenpo Ngachung also notes:

Since the pristine consciousness of the equipoise of those with sharp capacity is very sharp, there is no need to rely on the ascertainment of post-equipoise. [40/b] The pristine consciousness of the equipoise of those of dull capacity needs to rely on the ascertainment of post-equipoise and by the difference of whether one needs or does not need to settle in such ascertainment, one’s path is swift or slow. But there is no good or bad in the type of realization.

Those who do not need to ascertain pristine consciousness in post-equipoise are cig car was. But there are very few of those. As Zhigpo Dudtsi, a famous thirteenth century Dzogchen master stated, "I have searched high and low among the siddhas of India and Tibet, and while I cannot rule out the possibility of others, the only cig car was I know of are Saraha and Lingje Repa (founder of the Drukpa Kagyu)."

Most of us are people who have a need to confirm their experience with concepts in post-equipoise, just like ārya bodhisattvas.

More Musk fodder, monkeys typing on a computer "telepathically" using Neuralink.
Neuralink, the company that Elon Musk founded in 2016 with the vision of implanting a chip in people’s brains, is getting close to an important milestone: a human clinical trial of its technology.

But behind the scenes, the company has been plagued by dysfunctional management, Musk’s inconsistent involvement, and the lack of a clear chain of command, according to a half-dozen former Neuralink employees Fortune interviewed for a recent feature. That turmoil, the former employees say, has contributed to the departures of several key figures at the startup, including its day-to-day operational leader.

You are there live online or in person when pointing out / guru yoga is given. Then what about the rest of the teaching where the teacher is explaining the text etc....Does that have to be live also?

Malcolm wrote:
Not necessarily. But if one wants a lung of the text, then one needs to participate live. To this end some teachers give the lung of the text before hand or after, so that people can participate through recordings of the explanation.

Passing By said:
I don't see lamas having much qualms giving recorded Dzogchen instructions provided one has had transmission but I do recall you saying also that in Dzogchen, as long as the teacher is intending to transmit trekcho/thogal instructions etc then the teachings themselves count as direct introduction so what is the jury on recorded teachings?

Malcolm wrote:
This assumes you have received empowerment, understand and have experience with the example pristine consciousness, the meaning pristine consciousness, and the "proof" or "sign" pristine consciousness. Then it is fine. It's like reading a text whose contents you already understand.

Yes, outer objects are not a self appearance of the mind.
It means being able to be in the presence of the sambhogakaya directly; the sambhogakaya is a rupakaya.

Pietrepa said:
Thus, bodhisattvas on pure bhumis can hang out with actual buddhas in their sambhogakaya form, while those on impure bhumis only have visions of their own potentiality similar to the famous visions of a certain too-often-discussed practice here on the forum that merely resembles the buddhas, i.e. visionary forms of buddhas, yabyums, etc.?

Malcolm wrote:
Correct.

The difference is that it takes common Mahāyāna bodhisattvas two incalculable eons to reach the pure bhumis. For example, bodhisattvas on the first bhumi can visit an hundred buddhafields, see one hundred nirmāṇakāyas and so on, but the amount of time they have to spend on the paths of accumulation, application, and cultivation is daunting.

For this reason, we have Vajrayāna for those of sharper capacity. Tripitikamala states:

Although the goal is the same, since it is unconfused,
with many methods, not difficult,
and mastered by those of sharp faculties,
Mantrayāna is superior.

As Dzogchen teachings is the pinnacle of secret mantra, buddhahood may take only a few years at most if one is especially diligent. If not, then it is certain to occur in the bardo or in the next life without entering samsara again.

But in general, the purpose of secret mantra is buddhahood in this life, so it does not matter much which approach one takes. However, if one is not properly ripened, then there is no hope and one's desire for liberation will not be met. If one attempts to practice the liberating instructions without the basis of the ripening empowerment from a qualified teacher given properly, one's effort will be no better than trying to get oil from grinding stones.

But even then, so many Madhyamakas....so much disagreement!

As far as tantra goes, do you think we can justly situate Garchen Rinpoche outside the epistemic context of scriptures, mahasiddhas and panditas? That context is pretty darn pluralistic and diverse. There's room for a lot of different approaches, some which some find acceptable and others don't.

Indian Madhyamikas differed only on pedagogy, not on view.

I don’t have much of an opinion about Garchen Rinpoche, per se, other than that he is a very nice person. He’s doing the best he can.

But for reasons already stated, recorded empowerments lack the ability to ripen anyone, and I am happy to disagree with anyone who claims the opposite. If someone wants to view one of these things and imagine they’ve actually received an empowerment or lung from a recording, all I can do is shake my head and explain why they are mistaken.

The Tantra Without Syllables has this to say on that score:

There are no errors in the scriptures, but errors can arise in the intimate instructions.

Vimalamitra comments:

However, since the explanation of the instructions of the guru can be explained with or without error, it seems that errors can arise

Tantra without Syllables, pg. 148.

Since this is the case, one cannot just blindly accept anything one guru says, especially if it contradicts the sutras and tantras.

As for the reason why human beings need human gurus, and not rocks, books, and trees:

Though the nature of vidyā pervades all, the dharmakāya is encountered in the instructions.

As such, the nature of vidyā pervades all migrating beings, [90a] but they do not understand the instructions of the guru for encountering
the dharmakāya in direct perception. Vidyā cannot be found through an intellectual analysis of the body that is searched from head to foot. On the one hand, if it is asked whether vidyā exists in the body or not, it definitely exists in the body. On the other hand, [vidyā] is not nonexistent merely because it cannot be found through being sought with intellectual analysis. You are unable to find it because you lack the intimate instructions of the guru. Similarly, gold can be shaped by anyone who knows how to work with it, but the person who does not know how to shape it, nor how to refine it, nor how to smelt it and heat it, will not be able to work with gold, no matter how much intellectual analysis they perform. On the other hand, it is not the case that the gold itself is unworkable. Since there is an intimate instruction for refining it and so on, one can work with gold. The one who lacks the intimate instructions of the guru has no hope of buddhahood.

There is no empowerment if there is no guru.

This is true, and yet it can be understood on various levels, basically speaking.

There may, for instance, be a bodhisattva who is on the lower bhumis who is born and does not consciously know that they are a bodhisattva on the bhumis. They may live their life to a certain point and then they may, for instance, come across a picture of Tara in a book, or a mantra written on a rock, or whatever, and it may strike them with a certain force and ignite a certain disposition. They may then look into it and start meditating on Tara, saying her mantra, and they may have an experience where Tara's wisdom body reveals itself to them and they receive transmission in this manner.

Malcolm wrote:
Sorry, but this is a fantasy, and there is no "arya bodhisattva" exception. This is why those common Mahāyāna bodhisattvas, who lack the fortune of meeting a qualified Vajrayāna guru, need to traverse all ten stages over three incalculable eons until at the end of the tenth stage they receive abhiśeka from all the buddhas in the ten directions, as described in the Avatamsaka Sutra, the Lanka, etc.  Tenth stage bodhisattvas still retain a very evanescent knowledge obscuration. If one wishes to bypass this three incalculable eon requirement, one must meet a qualified Vajrayāna guru, then it is possible but not otherwise.

Seeker12 said:
Indeed, this is a manifestation of the Guru - the Guru can manifest in myriad ways. The Guru may manifest as a mantra on a rock, or a wind blown into one's face - these are types of nirmanakaya manifestations.

Malcolm wrote:
You have to have a guru first. And that does not happen absent a ripening empowerment.

Seeker12 said:
In essence, a sentient being is basically a conjured being who conceives of him or herself as a separate thing secondary to fundamental ignorance, and in essence, the guru is wisdom itself. It is indeed the case that all sentient beings need the guru, but the guru may manifest in many ways, depending on the merit, inclinations, etc of the sentient beings.

Malcolm wrote:
That won't happen even for a common Mahāyāna 10th stage bodhisattva, since in reality only buddhas can see the actual dharmakāya.

According to Dzogchen teachings, the ālaya and the dharmakāya can be differentiated only by someone who has attained full buddhahood in this life. Mind (sems) and pristine consciousness (ye shes) can be differentiated only by someone who has attained full buddhahood in the bardo of the moment of death. The pure and impure elements can be differentiated only by someone who has attained full buddhahood in the bardo of dharmatā. Samsara and nirvana can be differentiated only by someone who has attained full buddhahood in one of the natural nirmāṇakāya buddhafields. Vimalamitra writes about this with clarity and detail in the commentary on the Blazing Lamp Tantra.

All of this moot for someone who has not entered Vajrayāna, let alone Dzogchen teachings.

The appearance of Vajrayāna is a rare as stars in the daytime. Its sad when I see people who consider themselves Vajrayāna practitioners indulging in fantasies which actually serve only to hasten the decline of the Dharma.

The implication of Garchen Rinpoche's recorded Empowerments being valid, would be that his Samadhi is higher level than most other Lamas; or, alternatively, that some other Lamas have the same level of Samadhi, yet choose to not allow recorded Empowerments to be considered valid for their own good reasons.

Malcolm wrote:
The problem with the idea of recorded empowerments is that every physical mandala created by a vajramaster to give an empowerment is dissolved at the end of the rite, when the jñānasattvas are dismissed. One must do this before dismantling the mandala, whether it is a simple one heap rice mandala, or a complicated Kalacakra empowerment. If one does not, it is akin to killing a buddha.

Simply put, the mandala used to give the empowerment no longer exists in a recording of an empowerment. Therefore, there can be no empowerment from a recording. It simply isn't possible.

Even in a meaning empowerment, where there is no need to dismiss the jñānasattva, since rite is not happening live, no jñānasattva is summoned by the master since he is not present, thus no samadhi generated, to conduct the descent of the jñānasattva into the student wishing to receive the empowerment.

It really has nothing to do with "levels of samadhi," but rather the ritual mechanics of giving empowerments. And frankly, these issues are not trivial.

But running around claiming that one has received an empowerment from Tara without every having received her empowerment from a human master is just a source of laughter.

Claiming to have a prophetic declaration from the ḍākinīs is also quite unlikely to be believed. And the rig pa'i rsal dbang is not something one gives oneself, and this is explicitly stated in the Dzogchen tantras and commentaries.

So why is the Planck length thought to be the smallest possible length? The simple summary of Mead's answer is that it is impossible, using the known laws of quantum mechanics and the known behavior of gravity, to determine a position to a precision smaller than the Planck length. Pay attention to that repeated word "known." If it turns out that at very small lengths, some other version of quantum mechanics manifests itself or the law of gravity differs from our current theory, the argument falls apart. Since our understanding of subatomic gravity is incomplete, we know that the statement that the Planck length is the smallest possible length is on shaky ground. Still, until a better theory of quantum gravity is devised, the Planck length is the best estimate we have for a minimum length.

So in order to improve people's knowledge so they could understand Dzogchen teachings better, he wanted a place where they could learn these things. He and I discussed this several times.

Those who claim that their knowledge and understanding of Dzogchen won't be improved by studying lower yānas don't really understand Dzogchen very well.

That goes without saying, but that is not the issue and never was. If it were we could all just read about Dzogchen, and would never need introduction, ancillary practice, etc.

Instead we have to receive introduction/pointing out and preferably also instructions on clarification and dispelling doubt, etc. from a teacher.

The point is that consigning oneself to ignorance of ones own cognitions is actually, according to some presentations, basically a form of Marigpa.

This is actually not correct, as far as I know. I can supply quotes later, but for instance Tasha Nyamgel cites the ability to recognize subtle cognition as vital to recognition of Rigpa. That is, to truly recognize and stabilize Rigpa, one cannot be ignorant of rtog pa, in fact one has to have precise ability to notice the stream of continuous rtog pa moments and ignoring it or blocking them gets one stuck at an earlier part of the process related to only having awareness of “coarse cognition.” In fact, ones ability to not even notice them keeps practice at the level of shamatha, I think.

Malcolm wrote:
Better to use the term vitarka here. Vitarka is the operative mental factor in access concentration. Rongzom states in the chapter 6 of  his Intro to Mahāyāna Systems that if one cannot directly discover and be in knowledge of Dzogchen as he descrined it in chapter 5, that one has to use an indirect method. He states, either though using a mantra or regular śamatha, one must enter the first dhyāna, aka perfect śamatha, with its five characteristics: vitarka, vicara, pṛti, sukha, and ekagraha (initial attention, sustained attention, physical ease, mental ease, and one pointedness) and do this in the context of having intellectually cultivated Dzogchen view as described in chapter 5. Obviously, one defect is a lot of people mistake the access mental factor, vitarka (rtog pa) for full śamatha.

Malcolm wrote:
Which mean you have mistaken kalpana (rtog pa), concepts, which we are not talking about here; for vitarka (rtog pa), initial attention, which is what we are talking about here, because you are clearly unfamiliar with the presentation of mind and its mental factors (citta and caittas) and how terms like vitarka and tarka are translated into Tibetan (rtog pa).

The only time rtog pa/vitarka is absent in a sentient being who belongs to the desire realm is when their minds are in equipoise in second dhyāna on up. But since all eight dhyānas are actually conceptually-driven with an object of concentration, dhyāna and rig pa are not alike. Since there is no object in trekcho, it doesn't matter that in this state there exist neutral mental factors such as the mahābhūmikas—samadhi, cetana, and so on—as well as vitarka (rtog pa), vicara, and so on, or positive mental factors, like faith, etc., or even afflicted and negative mental factors. Where there is citta, a mind, there are caittas, mental factors.

In trekcho one is just resting in the direct perception of the sense organs with no particular object to focus upon, that is why any concepts (rtog pa, kalpana) that arise in rig pa automatically vanish without needing to apply an antidote, because sense cognitions are nonconceptual by nature, and mind (manas) isn't chasing any mental factors, concepts, or even uncompounded phenomena as its object in the dharmāyatana. But to claim concepts can never arise while in rig pa's equipoise, this is a very mistaken idea.

Been reading a few things and this is becoming relevant practice wise. Is this a good definition of rtog pa or am I getting confused?

If you have to be specific, what is the real difference between “coarse” and “subtle” cognition , is it just how it is experienced by the meditator?

This also connects with some of the discussions we have on thought vs. Rigpa, as in some presentations it seems that working with subtle cognition is absolutely vital.

Malcolm wrote:
You are discussing vitarka (rtog) and vicara (dpyod). These are two mental factors that accompany all desire realm minds. Vitarka, for example, is used to enter dhyāna; vicara sustains it. Some people translate as coarse and subtle, but really it refers to mental factor that allows us to switch objects and then one to sustain our attention on an object.

Sakya Monastery houses a huge library of as many as 84,000 books on traditional stacks 60 metres long and 10 metres high. Most of them are Buddhist scriptures, although they also include works of literature, history, philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, agriculture and art. One scripture weighs more than 500 kg, the heaviest in the world. The collection also includes many volumes of palm-leaf manuscripts, which are well-preserved due to the region's arid climate. In 2003, the library was examined by the Tibetan Academy of Social Sciences. The monastery started to digitize the library in 2011. As of 2022, all books have been indexed, and more than 20% have been fully digitized. Monks now maintain a digital library for all scanned books and documents.

This is Lama Fede. It’s been ages since I’ve been on this forum. Last time I was here, I was in the Sakya. How things have changed for us. I’m writing this since Lama Sherab is in mourning for Lho Ontul Rimpoche, another of his teachers and a close friend of Namkhai Norbu.

Malcolm wrote:
Hi Fede:


Ok. The issue here is a question of language. Chogyal Namkhai Norbu did not authorize your friend to teach. Authorizing your friend to "teach" would mean being part of SMS. The only person, apart from his children, that ChNN explicitly authorized to give empowerment, and so on, is the Chinese Khenpo, Yeshe Wangpo. So, there is no evidence for your friend's claim. Agreeing that he was qualified to teach and give empowerments outside Dzogchen community is not "blessed."

All ChNN said was that your friend had satisfied the traditional requirements of doing the approach and accomplishment of a major Yidam and the fire puja. They don't do fire pujas after the three roots in the DC. It's not part of the three roots requirements in SMS.

This might be seen as an endorsement by some. But its clear from this email that ChNN is just making an observation. There are, at this point, some thousands of westerners with the same qualifications, of whom ChNN would make the same observation.

It's clear that this your friend cannot teach in the DC, because he did not participate in the SMS teacher training. That means he was not authorized at all. I am also not authorized at all by Chogyal Namkhai Norbu to teach. I never sought to be an SMS teacher for a number of reasons.

Is your friend qualified to teach? That's between his students and he. I don't have an opinion about that one way or another.

Using dead gurus as endorsements on websites can be problematical, as this thread shows.

From the point of view of the new schools of tantra (sarma), everything that appears arises as the display of great bliss, and the display of emptiness. In the terminology of Dzogchen whatever manifests arises as the display of rigpa, and that is certain. So the agent responsible for all of this as well as the space and ground for it all, is the single state of Clear Light. Everything, in fact , is the display or array of Clear Light." Dalai Lama

Tsi ta sha means “fleshy heart”, the same term is used in Nyinthig aural lineage. But it does not refer to,the heart that pumps blood.

Doesn't that sound like the circulatory system's heart?

Malcolm wrote:
It's tempting to identify it as the so-called don snying, the heart muscle, but there is another explanation. The Sound Tantra states:

In the celestial mansion of the precious heart (tsi tta),
the precious gathering has eight doors.

This is explained by Vimalamitra as follows:

"The so-called citta means that since the elements gather, the body forms. Since the body gathers, the nāḍīs form. Since the nāḍīs gather, the bindus form. Since the bindus gather, lights and colors form. Since the colors gather, the vāyus form. Since the vāyus gather, pristine consciousnesses (ye shes) form. As such, the gathering point of all the nāḍīs is the citta. Since that is the basis for the arising of qualities, the pristine consciousness of vidyā is located in the precious celestial mansion. "Precious" refers to the gathering of all the nāḍīs, termed "the life of samsara and nirvana." There are four nāḍīs that are the native place of the elements, there are two nāḍīs in which two elements each are combined, adding up to six. There are two more nāḍīs that of male and female combined four elements, totaling eight. These are in the main and and intermediate directions."

And:

Pristine consciousness is located in the heart, the so-called "citta", the center of the body where all the nāḍīs gather.

The heart muscle is not in the center of the body, and Tibetans were quite aware of this. Thus, the reason why the citta is called the citta is because it is the center point of all the nāḍīs, as explained above.

SilverFantasy said:
I'm a Dzogchen practitioner, but have been really fascinated by the potential Chan influence on the practices, and of the origin of the belief in "Sudden Enlightenment" (compared to gradual). I was wondering if anyone knew anything about the history of this practice in India? Obviously things like the Heart Sutra point to it, and I'm familiar w/ the idea of Bodidharma bringing it into China. But were there schools that had "Chan" like practices in India, before Chan? Or was Chan really the originators of this idea?

Thanks

Malcolm wrote:
The source of the idea of sudden awakening is in the Lankāvatāra Sūtra, which was the sūtra Bodhidharma brought with him to China. There is a comment by Śrī Siṃha in one his commentaries in the Bairo Gyud Bum, where he discusses the Chinese approach to the two truths as "simultaneous entry."

I found this definition via Google Search:

"The Blue Lotus in Buddhism is the symbol of the victory of the spirit over the senses, of intelligence and wisdom, of knowledge. It is generally represented as a partially opened bud, whose center is unseen, the embodiment of the “perfection of wisdom”."

Malcolm wrote:
Generally, there is a blue poppy, called utpala in Sanskrit (which is not a lotus), held by some deities, which has a blossom, a semi open blossom, and a bud, representing the three kāyas.

This is not correct at all for the Tibetan tradition. When one participates in a refuge ceremony, all five disciplines are explained, along with the commitments of refuge. One receive all five disciplines, but can elect to follow, one, two, three, or all five. But it is not the case that one can go for refuge with at least adopting the discipline of refraining from taking life and the commitments of refuge.

Malcolm wrote:
The perception of the five lights as five elements comes about from that imputing ignorance, correct. But in the Dzogchen scheme of things, there has to be color which is not correctly ascertained as the light of one's own state in order for there to be error/delusion.

Echoing JD's point (to some degree): turn this practice into a guru yoga.

i.e. one could repeatedly bring to mind a supplication requesting realisations of impermanence etc. These are common to many formal guru yogas, as well as Lam Rim prayers etc.

This way, the repeated contemplation becomes infused with blessings - it is the easy and swift way to accomplish the four thoughts.

A simpler and faster way is to apply them to your own life through your own experience, rather than base them on stock imagery found in traditional texts. If one needs help through supplication, one isn't really taking them to heart.

Otherwise the only light that would be pristine would be a colorless one.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, it is colorless itself. The color is derived from it being disturbed by the elemental karma vāyus. This is all described in some detail in the commentaries and root tantras.

For example, when you stir a glass of pure water with a glass stick, one sees the water shimmer because of the distortion of light through the water. The motion does not make the water impure, but water has a different aspect because it is in motion.

Buddhahood, pg. 76-77:

The trio of the essence, nature, and compassion of the original basis becomes the three ignorances. Since the essence is made the cause delusion, it is designated “the ignorance of the same identity” and becomes so. Once the nature is made the condition of delusion, since the vāyu of the impelling karma manifests as color, it is designated "connate ignorance” and becomes so...

Of course, we all know that the impelling karma is the karma that projects one from this life to the next and so on.

Malcolm wrote:
BTW, I just want to add, again, most these qualms will be settled by reviewing the six faulty positions about the basis and the one correct position.

The six faulty positions are:

1. The basis is naturally perfected (lhun grub)
2. The basis is undefined (ma nges pa)
3. The basis is defined (nges pa)
4. The basis is totally mutable.
5. The basis can be accepted as anything at all
6. The basis is polychromatic or diverse.

The one correct position:

7. The basis is originally pure.

The Six Dimensions Tantra States:

The basis that is naturally perfect at the beginning
is nothing other than one thing.
However, if it is confirmed with authoritative understanding
through the positions of deluded appearances,
there is an appearance of seven stages
appearing in this way because oneness was not recognized
in the mode of the appearance of a single entity.

Now then, the meaning of this is as follows:
(1) the basis is present as naturally perfect,
appearing as the essence that subsumes the diversity.
(2) It is present as unfixed,
appearing as an aspect of mental movement.
(3) It is present as fixed in its own state,
appearing without change in recollection.
(4) It is present as transformable,
appearing as an aspect of mind because of effort.
(5) It is present as any sort of entity,
whatever appears, appears as its own essence.
(6) It is present as polychromatic,
appearing in the form of each individual element of diversity.
(7) It is present as pure from the beginning,
having always appeared as immaculate.
Among all of these stages of intellect,
the essence is pure from the beginning.

Thus seven is presented as the definitive definition.

It is fair to say that each of these six faulty positions are partial, in that they indicate aspects of the basis. However to take any of the six as defining features of the basis is erroneous. For example, taking the first position, the basis is naturally perfected/spontaneously presence, or whatever term you like, leads to the holding the non-Buddhist Samkhya position because when "appearing as the essence that subsumes the diversity" it is assumed that this one thing is "a substantial one thing." This is why Vimala in many different commentaries criticizes this position, for example, in the Commentary on the String of Pearls he says:

Since the position that the basis is naturally perfected is flawed, the basis is impossible. If the cause is asserted to be naturally perfected, the basis will be ineffective. Since the basis is given the name “cause,” the expression itself is defective. In that case, if it is deemed established, is the result established in that cause or not? If it is deemed established, one will not be able to avoid the fault that the result will possess a contradiction. 

What if sometimes [the basis] is a cause in which the result is also established? Since the cause is established from the result, there is (1) the fault of an infinite regress and (2) the unavoidable fault that the cause and the result are the same. 

If it is asserted [that the cause and the result] are the same, the expression, “the cause and result of karma,” will be defective.

If it is asserted that the cause and result are different, the assertion that the cause is naturally perfected is defective.
If that cause is established in the result, one cannot reject the consequence that the result is the cause. Therefore, since the result cannot be designated as the cause, the connection of the cause and the result should be understood from investigating them—causes generate results, but causes are not generated from results.

Alternatively, if it is asserted that everything is naturally perfected from everything, since one will not be able to refute what has not been asserted, one will not be able to prove one’s own assertion. Therefore, there is no purpose in [asserting the basis is] naturally perfected.

Since proving a favorable position and disproving an unfavorable position makes a naturally perfected basis one-sided, the assertion of a naturally perfected basis is defective. Suppose that the naturally perfected basis is stated to be nondual. If the cause, result, and so on are nondual, the assertion of a naturally perfected basis is defective. Saṃsāra and Saṃsāra and nirvāṇa are also rendered false. Further, reasoning negates the absence of a result at the time of a naturally perfected cause and so on. There are more reasonings to be elaborated with respect to that, but they will not be elaborated here.

--Self-Liberated Vidyā Tantra, Appendix II, pp.97-98.

All of these arguments are precisely the same arguments used by Madhyamaka authors to refute Samkhya's prakṛti.

Malcolm wrote:
They are not actually different, the dhātu and vidyā. One might say that the dhātu and vidyā are the union of the two truths, which is the basis as described as described in Mahāyāna.

There are various methods which may emphasize one or the other of these two, but the complete realization of one is the complete realization of the other since they are not separate.

If we were to talk about this in common Mahāyāna terms, we would say that gnosis apprehends emptiness in such a way that the subject, gnosis, takes on the aspect of the object, ultimate emptiness free from extremes, in yogic direct perception. This apprehension however isn't an apprehension since there are no signs that can be apprehended. Thus it is free from limitations or extremes (mtha' dang bral ba) and inexpressible.

The general problem that most people have in understanding this point is that when one is asked to differentiate the mind and vidyā, they are led to believe somehow that the mind and vidyā are actually two substantially different things. But they are not. The mind (sems, a catch-all term for the ālaya +), according to the unsurpassed secret cycle, is a product of the karma vāyus mingling with the potential/energy (rtsal) or radiance (mdangs) of vidyā in the heart cakra, which gives rise to the eight consciousnesses, and so forth, when the karma vāyus move through the eight nāḍīs of the heart cakra.

This is why Dzogchen teachings are included in Secret Mantra, first and foremost, because the understanding of liberation is grounded in an understanding of the formation of the body, and so on.

This capacity to cognize is not a transcendental subject, but a manifestation of the dynamic radiance of emptiness or original purity itself, to the extent that it is substantiated in an individual.

While nothing is established in bodhicitta, emptiness, there is a distinction between appearances and apparent objects in dualistic vision (play), which appear in one’s mind (rtsal), like a mirror. The apparent objects do not exist in rtsal, they externally exist by way of eight examples of illusion. Thus is why Dzogchen is not the same as Yogacara. Appearances are not mental factors.

Taking the life a human being is a defeat for a monastic. Taking the life of an animal, like drinking alcohol, damaging plant life and so on, is a minor transgression which involve only confession, and no censure.

But the four root disciplines are shared among all buddhists. It is unreasonable to think that the discipline of not taking life is more stringent for lay people than monastics, it certainly isn't when it comes to sexual misconduct. The reason the discipline of refraining from being intoxicated/drinking alcohol is included is that the discipline of refraining from sexual misconduct depends on the discipline of refraining intoxicated/drinking alcohol. Without accepting latter, one cannot follow the former. In the Mūlasarvāstivāda tradition we have a choice of following, one, two, three, or all five disciplines, but not four.

Moreover, in the Kośabhaṣyam, the only example where the implications of taking life is drawn, the discussion solely applies to taking the life of humans beings.

Hi everyone,

So I'm new to Dharma Wheel and was drawn here because I have a question. It's a bit sensitive. I will not mention anything that is banned by this forum. Basically, I took an empowerment from a Lama whose views go against His Holiness the Dalai Lama with regards to a certain practice, I don't need to say more. I have since receiving the empowerment experienced intense anxiety and obstacles and realised my mistake. My question is, can I abandon my commitment vows that I made during the empowerment and break my connection to this Lama? Or what would you advise? The empowerment is a Highest Yoga Tantra practice. I don't want to be associated with this Lama at all and I don't want to do any practice that I took from him.

I wish and hope and pray that more people listen to His Holiness and heed his warnings! I certainly will from now on.

I appreciate your advice.

Thank you

Hi Tashi(?),

I hope you don't mind me giving a more 'conservative' answer from the Gelug establishment, but it's an issue that we're constantly dealing with, and the fallout will continue for a few more generations yet. If Gelugpas abandoned all our lineages coming through gurus who practiced Shugden, the entire tradition would be dead by now.

Generally, abandoning any and all Shugden practices you have received is fine, and if you are worried about breaking any of those commitments, His Holiness the Dalai Lama has said to rely on migtsema recitation for protection.

Regarding how to view this vajra master and the other transmissions you received from them, it is a given that you should continue to view them with respect, and uphold the commitments you received, even if you no longer maintain a personal relationship with them. Just walk away but continue the practice, with the view of relying on the dharma and not the person. And view their continued involvement with Shugden as a mistake arising from their manifestation of ordinariness, just like how all our gurus make mistakes or have limitations. If you can, try to receive the empowerment again from a non-Shugden guru and remember that the nature of gurus is the same.

stong gzugs said:
Now that you have the full quote, pasted above, I'd be curious how you interpret it.

In it, ChNN clearly distinguishes between two bases, one transpersonal and one personal, and says that we can experience the transpersonal basis in meditation and this experience transcends the individual and produces a unification akin to the experience of Brahman.

Malcolm wrote:
The spyi gzhi is here defined as "space," the dharmadhātu, not consciousness, ala brahmin.  Within this space, the dhātu, is rig pa, likened to the sun. But if you think your total space is the same as my total space, you have not understood anything. The dharmadhātu is not established as anything. It is not even a nonexistent since it has never existed to begin with. It's a generic term for emptiness in Mahāyāna.

The reason ChNN here is using brahman as an example is because people tend to be very familiar with this idea of nonduality from Hindu sources. People are much more familiar with these ideas that the more refined understandings of Madhyamaka.

It is easy to.understand that when one is in a samadhi that is free from references that one will not experience time, etc. Why? Because this is state of free of references.

But there is a big difference between brahman, a transpersonal state, and the generic basis, which isn't a thing that exists, it isn't something that has the status of being. The general basis is just original purity.

When ChNN talks about the dharmadhātu, he always described it as a general emptiness, a way of talking about individual emptinessess in aggregate. Individual emptiness, of course is dharmatā śunyatā. In general, in Buddhist lingo, when we talk about elements in the universe, we talk about dhātus, like the sadadhātu, the dhatus of earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness. Or we talk about the sattvadhātu, the dhātu of sentient beings, or the buddhadhātu, the dhātu of buddhahood—incidentally, the sattvadhātu and the buddhadhātu are described as being coterminous.

Finally, this original purity is said to be permeated with the three pristine consciousnesses, essence, nature, and compassion: Vimalamitra states:

Now, in particular, the following is the unsurpassed position. This incontrovertible reality is present as kāyas since the essence is unchanging.
It is also present as the basis of the arising of the inseparable three kāyas. It is not established in terms of faces and hands, the signifying attributes. The nature is present as luminosity because it is clear. Though the three luminescences are self-illuminating, they are not established with attributes of color. Compassion is present as the pristine consciousness of vidyā; though manifesting individually, since there is no cessation in the aspect of omniscience, it is neither an agent nor an action.
--Buddhahood, pg. 75

This is very much the same sort of statement as the one I referred to in the commentary of the String of Pearls Tantra which is one of the earliest discussions of the seven positions concerning the basis. If one start claiming that the generic basis "exists" like brahmin, and is transpersonal, one runs into all kinds of logical problems of identity, difference, and so on. So, the best solution to this to understand that the spyi gzhi is a set of generic characteristics that are instantiated in an individual, because if not understand it in this way, there is a conflict between original purity and compassion, that latter defined as an individual instantiation of a person's consciousness. This is just an elaborate way to talk about the nature of the mind and how the three kāyas are established as the inner clarity (nang gsal) of any given sentient being.  and that is all.

That is not so difficult--- based on what ChNNR is stating, it is just a matter of an individual reaching an expanded state of consciousness.

I like simplify things. When we look at a yellow flower like a dandelion we all have the same experience of it, as we look at, touch it, etc. That experience is an expression of the inner workings of our bodies. The flower was not a concretized five lights. The five lights are not operating directly on the world that way. Our minds did not generate that flower.

Malcolm wrote:
It generated the way the flower appears, the representation, not the outer object. The way the flower appears is its snang lugs, mode of appearnce, the way that appearance of the flower actually exists is its gnas lugs, bhutatā, reality. The appearance of that flower does not exist as a mental factor. In Dzogchen teachings, it is held to exist as rtsal, the potential of the mind to appear in any form without being any of those forms (hence the mirror example). This is why it is clearly explained that the colors of the five lights arise from the contamination of the karma vāyus. The five lights, which are the expression of the five pristine consciousnesses, have no color of their own.

Distinguishing between the representation ('dra ba) and the basis that is being represented ('dra gzhi) is an important topic in Dzogchen teachings.

Longchenpa begins chapter 13, "First, at the time of purifying the cloud-like obscuration of deluded appearances, the group of eight of mind and mental factors, the all-basis, and the addictive five aggregates that appear from the solidified traces of apprehending a self when the basis has arisen as an appearance from the basis...

The question arises, from where does this grasping at self arise, with its concomitant deluded vision, mind and mental factors, and so on, arise if there is no continuum within which it might arise. How does diversity arise within this state if this state is a ontological singularity? A transpersonal basis must be an ontological singularity, otherwise there is no point in calling it "transpersonal."

This is the question you have to answer. And given that the entire history of Buddhist philosophy has never proposed an ontological basis for all phenomena, and has always been pluralist and nominalist, even in Yogacāra, how can one square the assertion of an ontological basis with Dzogchen teachings? Especially in light of the fact that Dzogchen tantras negate an such ontological basis from the outset.

stong gzugs said:
If we interpret the text as Samantabhadra just representing each of our individual original state rather than a shared state, and re-reading the text as pertaining to our individual basis (per ChNN and the view on this thread more generally), the analogy seems to end up being a bit solipsistic by saying that even the other sentient beings we experience (much less the inanimate objects) are just a projection or emanation of our individual basis. This isn't a problem if we view Samantabhadra as an all-pervasive dharmakaya, in the way that Tenzin Wangyal suggests.

Based on the position of Dzogchen represented in this thread, is the following characterization correct:

Spyi in spyi gzhi means spyi mtshan nyid, a universal characteristic or condition. Thus spyi gzhi means the “basic universal condition”. This universal condition is original purity.

There are not infinite bases for each person because the basis is a universal condition of every mind, not an entity.

To talk of this universal condition as one or many is incoherent because a universal or generic condition cannot be enumerated. For example, heat is a universal condition or characteristic of fires. This does not mean there is a separate entity, heat, that can be labelled one or many. However, the substantiation of heat in each fire is still individual.

Conventional expression in Dzogchen doesn’t go beyond Prasangika, this explanation included. Ati is wisdom, not a view.

personal Samantabhadra.

Malcolm wrote:
I am not claiming this. This is what it is clearly stated in a thousand Dzogchen texts.

Just as there are five kinds of vidyā, there are also find kinds of Samantabhadra. The Commentary on the Six Dimensions of Samantabhadra gives this as the essence and the definition:

Jules 09 said:
1.1.3.3.1.1 The essence of Samantabhadra is that it arises as the nature of everything, is not covered by anything and does not fall into any extreme.
1.1.3.3.1.2 The definition is that since there are many, sam. Since those are included in the foundation, one’s mind, anta. Since the evil concepts of samsara are interrupted, bhadra.

Malcolm wrote:
Now, what were you saying about Samantabhadra not being personal?

In reality, there are five Samantabhadras (and more) discussed in Dzogchen teachings: Original Nature Samantabhadra, Ornament Samantabhadra, [7/a] Teacher Samantabhadra, Vidyā Samantabhadra, Realization Samantabhadra, and so on. So it really depends, which Samantabhadra is one referencing?

Every sentient being who wakes up through Dzogchen methods can be called Samantabhadra. as explained in the Mind Mirror Tantra:

I am Realization Samantabhadra;
the yogin who dwells in the state of Samantabhadra
dwells on the stage of the sugatas. 
Samantabhadra (endowed with the meaning of realization) is the undistracted state, 
Samantabhadri is the unrestricted vast sphere.

So, be clear when asking questions about Samantabhadra, which one do you mean?

In Dzogchen, these two things do not stand in contradiction, it is only in pre-Prasanga Madhyamaka, like the Madhyamaka Rongzom criticized, where these are considered to be mutually exclusive.

The reality of it is that everything is simultaneously compounded and uncompounded, as the Sound Tantra commentaries points out:

Now then, it may be said “That is not the Great Perfection because the view is involved in avoiding extremes.” [We reply], that since [the view] is perfect as existence, this means there is nothing to seek. Since it is perfect as nonexistence, there is nothing to abandon. Since it is perfect as both, the meaning is that it is beyond accepting and rejecting. Since it is perfect as neither, everything becomes dharmatā. In the same way, In the same way, since being empty, not empty, and so on, are perfect, it is the meaning of the Great Perfection without falling into the extreme of hope and fear. Further, since it is a singularity, proliferation is eliminated. Since it is a plurality, there is nothing to abandon. Since it is an extreme, the middle is eliminated, since it is the middle, likewise, the extremes are eliminated. 

As such, how is it to be understood? Because there no middle in which to abide because of being free from extremes, the middle is annulled by negating the extremes, and likewise, there are also no extremes to perceive because the middle is negated.

The last two are just speculations, but would help explain why teachers emphasize the individuality so much, when it may be more accurate to say that the basis transcends the individual/collective distinction as Tenzin Wangyal and others in this thread have suggested above.

With respect to CHNN, whoever transcribed that failed to recognize Rinpoche’s Kham dialect, in which spyi is pronounced quite similarly to gshis.

This spyi is a contraction of spyi mtshan nyid, samanya laksana, I.e. generic characteristic, and in all Buddhist systems, universals, I.e generic characteristics, are held to be unreal. It’s almost unnecessary to point out that the Vaishesika/Nyaya is rejected in Dzogchen tenet systems presentations because they maintain the actual existence of universals.

As for things pervading samsara and nirvana, again, samsara and nirvana are personal by definition, not transpersonal. When one eliminates afflictions, samsara is no longer an experience for oneself. There is no universal samsara in which all beings live. As Nagarjuna states “This pair, samsara and nirvana, do not exist, however, thorough knowledge of samsara is nirvana.” So again, neither samsara nor nirvana are transpersonal phenomena.

Jean Luc Achard has completely refuted Tenzin Wangyal’s presentation of khyab rig, pointing out that this is just a Bonpo term for sugatagarbha, and that khyab rig only is found in sentient beings, not inanimate things.

Finally, the difference between the thumb-sized atman in the heart with the bindu of rigpa is that the latter is defined [in tne Khandro Nyinthig] as both compounded and uncompounded, since it is, according to Guru Rinpoche, identical with the causal bindu in the heart, made up of the refined five elements, the vayus, and the mind, and thus it is not permanent, nor does it shift from one body to another.

Your qualm about the limit to sentient beings assumes somehow that sentient beings are only humans. Why do you have this assumption? It’s strange. There are more ants under your house than humans on the planet.

There is a chapter in the Treaxury of the Supreme Vehicle on difficult points. I have discussed this elsewhere on several occasions.

The luminosity of one's vidyā is "personal" when it is limited by the mental construct of self: 'I', 'me' and 'my' vidyā.

"The difference between buddhas and sentient beings lies in the latter's narrowness of scope and attitude.
Sentient beings confine themselves to their own limited area of samsara through their own attitude and thinking.

It is said that the difference between buddhas and sentient beings is like the difference between the narrowness and openness of space. Sentient beings are like the space held within a tightly closed fist, while buddhas are fully open,
all-encompassing.

Basic space and awareness are innately all-encompassing. Basic space is the absence of mental constructs, while awareness is the knowing of this absence of constructs, recognizing the complete emptiness of mind essence.
Space and awareness are inherently indivisible."

Sharp said:
Why I am confused: the basis is called the basis because it is the basis for sentient beings and buddhas. In a very simplified way, Ma rigpa, sentient beings, are one function, rigpa, buddhas, are another function.

However, in its latent state, prior to the arising of sentient being or buddhas, how could you describe the basis, in this state, as personal?

Malcolm wrote:
In the same way that in a state of deep sleep there is no appearance of buddhas or sentient beings in our mind. Nevethless, when we awaken, the basis of our perceptions of dreams vs. waking is just our own consciousness.

The basis is a generic description of a set of qualities belonging to our own consciousness, the nature of the mind. The basis, aka sugatagarbha, does not belong to inanimate things.

The term "basis" in Vajrayāna texts has a long history and all traditions, including Dzogchen depend on a citation from the Guhyasamāja Uttaratantra:

A tantra is called a continuum.
This can be divided into three aspects:
the basis, the nature,
and the incorruptible.
The nature aspect is the cause.
Likewise, the incorruptible is the result.
The basis is called “the method.”
These three include the topics of tantra.

The basis can only be personal. It is part of an individual sentient being's continuum of basis, path, and result to buddhahood. The term "basis" has no meaning outside of this context. In Vajrayāna teachings in general, the term basis refers to the five aggregates. In Anuyoga and Dzogchen the term "basis" refers to pristine consciousness or sugatagarbha.

You can see this explanation given quite fully by Dudjom R. in the Big Red Book, pp. 261-267. He begins his discussion with the above citation.

Sharp said:
The basis [for sentient beings/buddhas], which is personal, has not yet "arisen from the basis". To whom or what function could the term personal correspond, since there is no who, no what, no function i.e. "no thing, no-one, nothing at all"?

Malcolm wrote:
This again is subjective. Since the basis is latent, it isn't a nothing, since it is described latent, it has the potential to arise. And what is this basis? Just your mind between eons. This is all very clearly described in the commentary on the Sound Tantra, etc.

Sharp said:
Why would it not be accurate to say that, primordially, prior to the arising of sentient beings or buddhas i.e. individual perspectives, that the basis cannot be described as individual or non-individual or any other adjective within the catuskoti, in this state?

Malcolm wrote:
One, you are taking the term "ye" too literally. The more common descriptor is thog ma, as in thog ma gzhi, original basis. This basis is also called the spyi gzhi, the generic basis. Not only this, you are ignoring the fact that what causes the basis "to arise" are traces of karma. Well, where do you think that karmic residue comes from?

You are understanding the caturskoti according to the Madhyamaka way, not the Dzogchen way. What is the Dzogchen way? Vimalamitra states in the Sound Commentary:

"Free from the extreme of existing, emptiness transcends identification. Free from the extreme of not existing, the circle of the luminosity of one’s vidyā transcends the extreme of annihilation. Freedom from both [existing and not existing] transcends grasping the extremes of permanence and annihilation. Freedom from neither [existing nor not existing] lacks bias and falling into extremes. Likewise, because of being free from all extremes, such as appearance, nonappearance, both, and neither, clarity, obscuration, and both of those extremes, being, nonbeing, and so on, no extreme at all is fallen into, and further, there is freedom in total perfection without abandoning the principle of freedom [from the four proliferations]."

When understood in this way, there is no contradiction between absence of identity (emptiness transcending identification, Madhyamaka caturskoti) and the luminosity of one's vidyā, which is necessarily personal.

KathyLauren said:
In my experience, precepts are not required prerequisites for initiations, not are they given automatically as part of initiations.

Malcolm wrote:
In every initiation, upāsaka pratimokṣa are automatically received when ones recites the verses of refuge after the presiding master, along with the bodhisattva trainings when one recites the verses of generating bodhicitta. Thus, there is no initiation where one does not adopt Mahāyāna pratimokṣa and the bodhisattva trainings.

But in the Sarvastivāda tradition, to which all Tibetan Buddhist traditions and their offshoots belong, one has a choice of which of the upāsaka five disciplines (samvara) one will maintain: one discipline, two disciplines, three disciplines, or all five.

The commitments of refuge however, which differ from the pratimokṣa, must be followed by everyone. The commitment of going for refuge to the Buddha is to refrain from taking nonbuddhist teachers, such as Jesus, Shiva, Krishna, Lao Tzu, and so on, as one's teacher. The commitment to going for refuge in the Dharma is avihimsa, to refrain from harming others, and the commitment to going for refuge to the Sangha is to refrain from associating with evil people and those who would cause harm to the Three Jewels.

Thus a one discipline upāsaka maintains the discipline of not killing (which principally means not killing humans, but also in killing in general) in addition to the commitments of refuge. A two discipline upāsaka maintains the discipline of not killing, and not stealing, in addition to the commitments of refuge. A three discipline upāsaka maintains the discipline of not killing, not stealing, and not lying, in addition to the commitments of refuge. A  full upāsaka maintains all five disciplines, in addition to the commitments of refuge, because the discipline of refraining from sexual misconduct depends on the discipline of refraining from intoxication.

The same thing applies to that basis. The basis Is described in terms of a certain set of characteristics which have specific functions. You seem to forget that from the point of view of Dzogchen teachings everything is completely equivalent to an illusion. That means that even Dzogchen teachings and everything they describe are just a set of conventions and nothing more. But those conventions are important because they assist sentient beings, who don’t exist, to realize a Buddhahood that doesn’t exist, because if there was a basis that existed as anything other than a mere convention, neither Buddhas nor sentient beings would be possible.

Firstly we had to follow every teaching with Gui Ming Shang Shi! Then post that once a day regardless of if a teaching had been posted.

And most days we would get reminders to do this along with warnings that the Guru felt displeased we weren’t showing enough respect to his teachings.

Jules09 is correct - an accurate convention is not possible.

Malcolm wrote:
No, he is incorrect. A convention is not just an arbitrary designation. A convention is an appearance, which is then given a designation according to its function, for example, a car.

Further, if accurate conventions for rig pa are not possible, then why do such authors as Vimalamitra, Longchenpa, and Jigme Lingpa go through such trouble to describe it in such detail? They go through such trouble because they are using language to describe a path dharma. For example, Vimalamitra goes through five different types of rig pa in a text called the Lamp that Summarizes Vidyā in the Agate Letters from the Vima Nyinthig (vol. 2, pp. 226-228).

"The first of these five is called "the vidyā that apprehends (generic) and particular characteristics. The vidyā that apprehends [generic] and particular characteristics is called "the vidyā that nominally designates generic and intrinsic [characteristics] of phenomena. That is one's own vidyā that is just a clear and nonconceptual consciousness (shes pa) contaminated by many cognitions (shes pa). 

Next is the [vidyā] that appropriates the basis. When [it] dwells in one's body, it generates all consciousnesses and abides merely as an intrinsic clarity, that is called "unripened vidyā." 

The vidyā of the original basis is the essence, the originally pure reality, existing endowed with three pristine consciousnesses (ye shes). Undivided vidyā exists as the essence of omniscient pristine consciousness. That pristine consciousness abides as a subtle pristine consciousness. If that pristine consciousness did not exist, there could be no liberation from emptiness, on the other hand (if not asserted to be empty), there would be no liberation from the inert. If vidyā exists as (five-fold) pristine consciousness it would be no different than the nirmāṇakāya. 

The vidyā of vipaśyanā is the vivid appearances when the instruction is explained, and therefore, the self-appearance is termed "endowed with an essential bindu." Though many different appearances are exhibited, all arise from nonarising, a great miraculous display (of vidyā) in every way. 

The vidyā of thögal is having reached the measure of appearances due to practice (though their own nature is not established), there is no increase or decrease in experience. After the signs and qualities are complete, though their nature is not established, when it is intrinsically clear as omniscient pristiene consciousness, it is called "casting off the the Dharma (because it is beyond words)," it is called "the exhaustion of phenomena (because an original nature cannot be found)," it is called "transcending Dharma (because the instructions cannot be found)," and it is called "liberation from phenomena) because there is no arising in mere arising. 

Are those vidyās the same or different? They are not different, because there is nothing more than a single nature. When this vidyā is seen from the perspective of subtlety, it is called "profound." When it is seen from the perspective of bindus and lights, it is called an "appearance." When seen from the perspective of clarity, it is called wisdom (prajñā). When it is seen from the perspective of appearing as diverse appearances, it is called "vast." When it is seen from the perspective of bliss, it is called "compassion (thugs rje)." When it is seen from the perspective of existing as observable, it is also an entity (dngos po). When arriving at the measure of practice, the exhaustion of phenomena, it is empty. There nothing other than a single essence, and since there nothing to clarify or obscure, it is unique and singular (nyag cig). Since the apparent part of appearances exponentially increase, it is multiple. Since the appearances that arise every way are indescribable, it is limitless. When seen from the perspective of there being nothing other than single meaning vidyā, it also subsumes. When seen from perspective of natureless colors, it is clear. As such, all the appearances appearing as diverse appearances never go beyond a single vidyā.

And then of course, we have Vimalamitra's definition in the Blossoming Lotus:

Sharp said:
Vidyā (rig pa) is (1) the knowledge of names designated by words; (2) the five sciences (rig pa gnas lnga) such as helpful worldly knowledge like healing, arts and crafts, the treatises, and so on; (3) knowledge (rig pa) as a factor of consciousness, such as sharp and dull worldly knowledge and so on; and (4) the knowledge of the essence (snying po) that permeates all, which is free from ignorance, unobscured by the obscurations of ignorance, and so on.

Malcolm wrote:
In this last definition then, we see vidyā, rig pa, being defined primarily in terms of fourth definition given in the Agate Letters.

Finally to settle the question of whether vidyā is personal or not, in Buddhahood in this Life it is stated:

As such, since there is neither good or bad nor large or small in the reality (gnas lugs) of the original basis or in the reality (gnas lugs) of the individual vidyā of sentient beings in the present, it is said that the three times are one and undifferentiated. If it is asked why this is so, it is because it is self-originated, self-arisen, and self-liberated.

Again Buddhahood we find how delusion happens. How does delusion happen? It happens because there is a consciousness aspect to the basis:

Second, the delusion due to not recognizing one’s appearances: if it is asked how delusion came about, delusion arose from the difference
between the basis and the conscious aspect of the basis. Apart from generally pervading, the so-called basis is totally undifferentiated, without any consideration of delusion or nondelusion. That so-called knower [26b] or “mind” (the special assertion of a consciousness explained in our own texts) is deluded.

So, since we also know that Garab Dorje's commentary on the Single Son of the all the Buddha's tantra clearly states that this universe cycle arises based on the latent traces left over from sentient beings in the last universe cycle, we don't have to wonder where consciousnesses come from, or the sense organs that rose up from the basis, as described in the commentary to the Sound Tantra.

And all of this is merely on the level of conventional, that is functional, descriptions of the appearance of basis, path, and result.

Malcolm wrote:
Dzogchen teachings accept the limitations of language in discourse. For example, the Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra begins: "Children of good families, listen faithfully without distraction! My explanation of the great meaning to each of you will remove the concepts in your minds."

So here we have the pronouns my, you, and your.

Further:

For sentient beings without realization,
each word must be understood with each meaning.
Therefore, connect the meanings with the words
and illustrate the great meaning with words.
Therefore, investigate the connection between the words and
meanings.
Though the illustrative words and letters
may not exist in utter purity itself,
because they remove mental doubts,
one should always be acquainted with the words.

And:

The transcendent state of all buddhas
is not words and syllables,
but appears like words and syllables.
Nevertheless, the great meaning is unravelled with words.

So, fortunately, even though the meaning of the great perfection is beyond verbal reifications such as self, other, and so on, Nāgarjuna's dictum remains in force in Dzogchen teachings:

Without relying on the conventional, the ultimate will not be understood;
without realizing the ultimate, nirvana will not be attained.

In brief, when the concept apprehending a self arises out of the basis, the state of original luminosity, there was delusion into samsāra because of not recognizing one’s state. While enjoying the diversity of happiness and suffering, buddhahood itself existed within oneself. Since one practiced according to the profound instructions introduced by the guru, since one recognized the appearance of luminosity arising from oneself in this life, the bardo or the next life, after one is free from samsāra, one will accomplish the intention of effortlessly accomplishing the two benefits, thus it is necessary to be diligent in practice.

A tantra (rgyud, continuum) is both pure and impure. The pure tantra is (1) the pure continuum of the natural state, (2) the pure continuum of the supporting object, and (3) the pure continuum through the critical point of progress in one’s own vidyā.

The pure continuum of the mode of being of the entities of the pure natural state is the essence, the originally pure basis that is not confirmed
by anyone [5b] and is beyond multiple expressions. Not even a slight object of delusion exists as something to designate with words. The natural mode of existing includes consciousness and the objects of consciousness. That consciousness is included in the continuum of a perfect buddha.

I could go on, but TL;DR.

As others have said, linguistic conventions are useful as a pedagogical tool, but are naturally going to be limited by dualistic language.

Here is a hopefully useful quote from Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche on this point. He warns against taking conventions such as "personal Samantabhadra" (for example) to imply infinite, individual Samantabhadra's, explaining that doing so would be an error and entering into dualism (avidya):

We could think that there are infinite Samantabhadras, but when we are in the state of Samatabhadra, what does “infinite” mean? This is already a limited viewpoint. The true condition is beyond numbers. If we think in terms of an “individual being”, this means that we are limiting, and consequently everything becomes complicated. If we want to understand, we must not limit [...] in knowledge there is not even the concept of “one and two,” otherwise we have already entered into dualism. Also the concept of “individual” presupposes dualistic vision. But Samantabadhra is beyond all this, isn’t he?”

Malcolm wrote:
You’ve misunderstood his point. You can understand this by contrasting this statement with others in this thread. For example, CHNN taught:

There is a saying of Guru Padmasambhava: “All enlightened beings in that real state are of the same principle; in wisdom all enlightened beings are the same.” This does not mean that all beings become one, but they are one in being of the same principle, the same knowledge, the same condition.

Early Buddhist schools were seemingly dualistic as they distinguished between citta and rupa or mind and matter and while rupa does not originate from citta, they are clearly inseparable and interdependent.

Injrabodi said:
I'm not a particularly educated man, nor a scholar. I am a simple farmer. However I must say that this sounds exactly like Sāṅkhya.

In Sāṅkhya there exist two primordial elements- Puruṣa (consciousness) and Prakṛti (matter/energy). Puruṣa is that which perceives and Prakṛti is that which is perceived (including all mental phenomena).

All of the various layers of reality are born from the seeming union and division of Puruṣa and Prakṛti.

Kai lord said:
However as one moves up to higher vehicles, their differences will gradually become more abstract and the distinctions start to become blur which eventually culminated in "non-duality " or totality state taught in Vajrayana especially Dzogchen.

Injrabodi said:
This is exactly what is taught in Kashmiri Shaivism. They expanded the map of the tattvas beyond Puruṣa and Prakṛti, to various levels of their union. At the uppermost level is Paraśiva, the perfect and absolute union of Śiva and Śakti.

And that apparently isn’t the case.

You did also say above that Buddhas can fall back into samsara at the beginning of any Mahakalpa, but that only applies to Buddhas who attained Buddhahood through Yanas other than Mahasandhi, yes?

There's not one cite that says or implies Buddhanature is individual and specific to each person.

Malcolm wrote:
In fact, the Lankāvtāra Sūtra states that tathāgatagarbha is just a name for the ālayavijñāna. How is the ālayavijñāna not personal and individual?

Asanga states in the Uttaratantra commentary that the name for the dharmakāya encased in afflictions is "tathāgatagarbha." How can personal afflictions encase a transpersonal entity? He later states in the same that the name for suchness, tathāta, encased in afflictions is tathāgatagarbha. The same question applies. He later describes sentient beings as "tathāgarbhins", possessors of tathāgatagarbha. In the same way consciousness pervades all sentient beings, it is stated that tathāgatagarbha pervades all sentient beings. However, no one thinks the phrase "consciousness pervades all sentient beings" means there is one unitary consciousness that pervades all sentient beings. It is the same with the basis, tathāgatagarbha. Finally, Asanga concludes his treatises by pointing out that the gnosis of tathāgatagarbha is just the tathāgata's gnosis of emptiness. He says:

"Without the gnosis of ultimate emptiness, it is impossible to realize and actualize the dhātu of pure nonconceptuality. Having stated this, the gnosis of tathāgatagarbha is the Tathāgata's gnosis of emptiness. Further, it is said extensively that the tathāgatagarbha has not been seen or realized by all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. However tathāgatagarbha is, the dharmakāyagarbha is just like that, and it is not within the domain of those who fall into a view of personality (satkāyadṛṣṭi), because the dharmadhātu is the antidote to views."

So how is the dharmadhātu defined in this text? Again "The so-called dharmadhātu is the tathāgatagabha that is no different than the nature of one's dharmatā."

So here you have a very precise description of tathāgatagarbha being described as individual and specific to each sentient being. Since the spyi gzhi is just a term for tathāgatagarbha in Dzogchen teachings, we can understand the meaning to be the same here, especially since in the discussion of how the basis exists in the body in the third topic of the Tshig don mdzod, Longchenpa mainly cites from the Uttaratantra.

In the same way that we talk about the vijñānadhātu or the sattvadhātu as aggregates of consciousness and sentient beings, we talk about the dharmadhātu as an an aggregate of dharmatās. Without individual dharmatās that belong to dharmins, we cannot talk about dharmatās at all, just as we cannot talk about the emptiness of nonexistents like the children of barren women, etc.

And of course in Vajrayāna teachings, we go a step further and site the location of sugatagarbha in the bodies of sentient beings. However, the idea the sugatagarbha sited in the bodies of all sentient beings refers to one transpersonal entity has been rejected by the Buddha very clearly as an incorrect view of atman. For example, the Nirvana Sūtra (Chinese recension) explicitly rejects it: "Child of a good family, some tīrthikas advocate a permanent "self," other advocate an annhilationist "not-self." The Tathagata is not like that. Because he teaches self and not-self, it is called "the middle." Now, whoever teaches the Buddha's middle way can say that the nature of buddhahood exists in all sentient beings, but it is not known and not seen because it is obscured by afflictions. Therefore, be diligent in the method of eliminating afflictions."  The Indian recension of the Nirvana sutra states, "The buddhadhātu exists in all sentient beings, held in each one's body. After sentient beings exhaust afflictions, they become buddhas."

I could go on, but we are getting into TL;DR territory

If we're both standing in the same ocean and I realize I'm wet, why would that imply that you'd also recognize you're wet? A shared basis doesn't at all logically imply that we'd have simultaneous realization, or the same result. This argument doesn't even work against Advaita, where the whole point is that Brahman doesn't act, so that's why it's vidyā of Brahman that liberates people, and not Brahman itself, and one person gaining vidyā doesn't affect any other person. No lineage that I'm aware of thinks of vidyā/rigpa as collective. The question here is about the basis.

To make this claim means that all of us have individual bases which have, what, existed since the end of the last Mahapralaya and the start of the Mahakalpa? This seems rather odd. The Dzogchen "origin story" of winds stirring in the basis lends itself more to a story about an original shared basis than it does about all of the billions of human beings (much less all the others) always having had separate individual bases

Malcolm wrote:
It means mind streams have no beginning, which is just standard buddhism.

Positing individual bases from the start creates logical conundrums too: Does this mean the number of bases is fixed upon the start of each Mahakalpa?

If we're applying Nagarjuna, the correct statement would be that the basis is neither individual, nor collective, nor both, nor neither.

Because, as Natan points out below, the concept of individuality isn't present when one is in rigpa.

The term rig pa is a contraction of the term so sor rang gyis rig pa'i ye shes, i.e. a gnosis that one knows individually, this is how it is defined by Longchenpa. It's a very common buddhist term.

The origin story for Mahākāla and Śrīdevi is found in the Ḍākinī-agnijihva-jvalā-tantra.

Mahākāla and Śrīdevi are the children of Mahādeva and Umadevi, according to this tantra.

Hi again, I'd agree that "views" should be for crossing over, not for grasping as per the famous parable of the raft, yet I detect a great deal of "grasping" at views (even complete identification with) in others which in my opinion belies the import of the parable.

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddha's path begins with right view:

"And how is right view the forerunner? One discerns wrong view as wrong view, and right view as right view. This is one's right view. And what is wrong view? 'There is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed. There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions. There is no this world, no next world, no mother, no father, no spontaneously reborn beings; no brahmans or contemplatives who, faring rightly & practicing rightly, proclaim this world & the next after having directly known & realized it for themselves.' This is wrong view...

And already cited:

[Kaccayana:] "Lord, 'Right view, right view,' it is said. To what extent is there right view?"

[The Buddha:] "By & large, Kaccayana, this world is supported by (takes as its object) a polarity, that of existence & non-existence. But when one sees the origination of the world as it actually is with right discernment, 'non-existence' with reference to the world does not occur to one. When one sees the cessation of the world as it actually is with right discernment, 'existence' with reference to the world does not occur to one.

"By & large, Kaccayana, this world is in bondage to attachments, clingings (sustenances), & biases. But one such as this does not get involved with or cling to these attachments, clingings, fixations of awareness, biases, or obsessions; nor is he resolved on 'my self.' He has no uncertainty or doubt that, when there is arising, only stress is arising; and that when there is passing away, only stress is passing away. In this, one's knowledge is independent of others. It is to this extent, Kaccayana, that there is right view."

"'Everything exists': That is one extreme. 'Everything doesn't exist': That is a second extreme. Avoiding these two extremes, the Tathagata teaches the Dhamma via the middle: From ignorance as a requisite condition come fabrications. From fabrications as a requisite condition comes consciousness. From consciousness as a requisite condition comes name-&-form. From name-&-form as a requisite condition come the six sense media. From the six sense media as a requisite condition comes contact. From contact as a requisite condition comes feeling. From feeling as a requisite condition comes craving. From craving as a requisite condition comes clinging/sustenance. From clinging/sustenance as a requisite condition comes becoming. From becoming as a requisite condition comes birth. From birth as a requisite condition, then aging & death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, distress, & despair come into play. Such is the origination of this entire mass of stress & suffering.

One basic text that opens the way to the Madhymika position is the Theravada Majjhima Nikaya 63. A small section, where a would be follower of the Buddha objects to the Buddha's refusal to commit to any definitive answers:

These speculative views have been left undeclared by the Blessed One, set aside and rejected by him, namely: ‘the world is eternal’ and ‘the world is not eternal’; ‘the world is finite’ and ‘the world is infinite’; ‘the soul is the same as the body’ and ‘the soul is one thing and the body another’; and ‘after death a Tathāgata exists’ and ‘after death a Tathāgata does not exist’ and ‘after death a Tathāgata both exists and does not exist’ and ‘after death a Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist.’ The Blessed One does not declare these to me, and I do not approve of and accept the fact that he does not declare these to me......

This is only the passage actually cited by Nāgārjuna in the MMK.

As for his position on a self:

laic said:
"Bhikkhus, form is not-self. Were form self, then this form would not lead to affliction, and one could have it of form: 'Let my form be thus, let my form be not thus.' And since form is not-self, so it leads to affliction, and none can have it of form: 'Let my form be thus, let my form be not thus.'

"Bhikkhus, feeling is not-self...

"Bhikkhus, perception is not-self...

"Bhikkhus, determinations are not-self...

"Bhikkhus, consciousness is not self. Were consciousness self, then this consciousness would not lead to affliction, and one could have it of consciousness: 'Let my consciousness be thus, let my consciousness be not thus.'

Not really.

The term "ye gzhi," primordial basis, just refers to nature of the mind prior to recognition/conceptualization. This is why in any moment, we can wake up according to the six special features of Samantabhadra's liberation. In every moment it exists prior to buddhas or sentient beings, because in every moment we can either wake up or continue in ignorance. If someone thinks this refers to an actual event in time, they have already defeated the idea that the primordial state is beyond time.

Malcolm wrote:
One cannot experience "treeness" at all. It is a mere abstraction.

One's mind essence cannot be realized without one's mind. In other words, clarity and emptiness, the mind essence, are isolates of a given mind, in the same way in water, limpidity, wetness, and coolness are isolates, particulars, and not universals, which is why the nature of the mind can be realized.


I think you are bit confused about universals and particulars, especially with respect to Dzogchen teachings.

"Now, when we look at this interdependence of mental and physi-
cal constituents from the perspective of Highest Yoga Tantra, 4
there are two concepts of a person. One is the temporary person
or self, that is as we exist at the moment, and this is labelled on
the basis of our coarse or gross physical body and conditioned
mind, and, at the same time, there is a subtle person or self which
is designated in dependence on the subtle hody and subtle mind.
This subtle body and subtle mind are seen as a single entity that
has two facets."... [Awareness and wind.]

We have to be specific about what we are discussing, negating and distinguishing, but also not take them too far.

Still its better for us to view both practices of Yangdak Heruka and Vajrakilaya as indispensable. The latter is needed to remove, outer, inner and secret obstacles to one's practices.

Passing By said:
Some sources say Vajrakila, some say Kila in combination with Yangdak. Either way, both of those are not purely Mahayoga only practices. Either way I don't think you can say Guru Rinpoche did not do much Anuyoga considering his own commentary on Vajrakila features Anuyoga heavily.

His Kila commentary, (bum nag), is kama from Yeshe Tsogyel BTW so it's one of the earliest works. It really seems the the inner tantras weren't so clearly separated back then and everything was generally practised together.

Kai lord said:
If His Vajrakilaya practice was the exact same one from the Khon tradition, then yes its Anuyoga but it also does not have much completion stage practices, so its likely to be practicsed together with the Yangdag.

I'm fine with Yangdag being viewed as anuyoga. Sakya Trichen did say that Yangdag is very similar to Hevajra, so there is no need to do both practices. That would necessarily imply that mother tantras like Hevajra can be treated like an anuyoga after all.

And no, "there isn’t a unified Buddhanature pervading all sentient beings" because the Basis, Buddhanature has never been fragmented, so cannot be said to be "unified". And neither is it the case that each sentient being has 'their own' Buddhanature.

Malcolm wrote:
The basis is just a generic set of attributes, this is why Dzogchen texts refer to it as the "spyi gzhi," "the generic basis."

All fires are hot. Not all fires are the same. The same heat does not permeate all fires. "heat" is a "spyi mtshan nyid," a generic characteristic (samanyalakṣana), known in western philosophy as a universal. Dzogchen is a Buddhist system, and like all the other ones, is nominalist in orientation.

The general example in Dzogchen for buddhanature is the oil in sesame seeds. The Vajrasattva Mind Mirror:

Tathāgatagarbha exists intrinsically in all sentient beings. That exists just as sesame seeds are permeated with oil. Its basis — it is based on the material aggregate.

When you press one seed, it produces its own oil, not the oil of all seeds. When you "press" one sentient being with the path, that being produces their own buddhahood, not the buddhahood of all beings. So you are incorrect, every sentient beings possesses their own buddhanature just as every sesame seed possesses its own oil.

The reason why the basis is beyond one or many is that the basis is a generic set of attributes, just as heat, the generic attribute of fire, is beyond one or many. Since generic characteristics are unreal, they cannot be quantified as being "one" or "many." Why are they unreal? Because they are abstractions.

This is a good thing to do in some cases, in some cases, it is not. For example, the term ye shes has taken on a completely different understanding than the term jñāna in Sanskrit, even in the way it is explained on the basis of Indian texts. There is a Ven diagram of congruence, but we cannot say that Tibetan ye shes = Sanskrit jñāna, so I use different strategies for different lineages of texts. But in no case do I ever privilege Sanskrit over Tibetan, I triangulate. Part of the reason for this is Buddhist Sanskrit is also a derivative or foreignizing language (most Indians never knew Sanskrit, for example), and many definitions and ways of explaining things in Sanskrit are problematic when looking at the vernacular origins of most Buddhist terms. It is not like the translations from vernaculars into Sanskrit, or even original compositions in Sanskrit, were done under the strictest of academic discipline.

So, I think it is important to preserve the temporal implications of kṣaṇa, which the Tibetan clearly does adequately.

Yes, "eight freedoms" is a bit of an interpretative translation. There is one opportune moment that is free from the eight inopportune ones. According to Prajñākaramati, kṣaṇasampad is "the good fortune or completeness of the opportune moment (kṣaṇa) of being free from the eight inopportune moments (akṣaṇa)" (aṣṭākṣaṇavinirmuktasya kṣaṇasya saṃpattiḥ samagratā).

One who grasps to wrong views, of animal-hood, of preta-hood, or who comes forth in niraya,
Not obtaining the words of the Jina, and is born as a border-mleccha or as a dumb idiot,

Samaya in Dzogchen is to remain in that which was pointed out, no?
And if one can't do that, then the samayas of Tantra come into play.

- Anyone disagree?

Malcolm wrote:
VImalamitra disagrees, Buddhahood in This Life:

Further, the result of buddhahood arises without impediment from the conjunction of a qualified guru, a disciple who possesses samaya, and the blessings of the empowerment. For example, like grain ripening after a seed is planted in fertile soil, well-tended with water, and so on, the result ripens based on not damaging samaya after the empowerment has been conferred upon one’s pure continuum.

Longchenpa disagrees, in the Lama Yangthig:

Now then, although there is nothing to damage or transgress, the natural great completion being beyond a boundary to protect, it is necessary for yogins on the path of practice to abide in commitments.

The 27 samayas are the samayas of Dzogchen, as well as the five things to accept, etc. These samayas are mentioned in the Self-arisen VIdyā tantra, etc. The root and branch samayas, and so on, are  stated in the Realms and Transformations of Sound Tantra:

Though the different explanations of the samayas that
support the empowerment
cannot be covered by speech,
in brief, [the vows of] body, speech, and mind
are to be applied to the yogi’s body, voice, and mind.
The object is the guru and vajra siblings.
The divisions of the field of protection
are the vows of body, voice, and mind,
and maintaining the place of the secret vajra.

Of course there are four unbreakable samayas related to the basis, but they are unbreakable. The others are breakable, and have the following consequences. The Self-Arisen Vidyā states:

You must maintain the samaya vows.
Keep in mind the concise explanation
of the samayas, said to number one hundred thousand.
Further, the brief explanation includes 
the samayas of the view to be realized,
the samayas of continuous conduct,
the samayas of general practice,
the common general samayas,
the samayas of body, speech, and mind,
the secondary samayas,

The master and disciple who possess the meaning
abide in equipoise in utter purity,
and likewise, they are endowed with samaya.
If samaya is damaged, both master and disciple will be
burned.


So who can say that the samayas are not critical in Dzogchen teachings?

Malcolm wrote:
It is axiomatic. If you give lungs of tantric texts, they carry samaya. Otherwise, one is revealing secrets to the unripened. It is the seventh root downfall, of the 14 root downfalls.

And for Dzogchen specifically, Longchenpa writes in the Lama Yangthig's Ocean of Liberation:

"The appropriate secrets are the commitments substances of mantra; the five meats, the five nectars, the vajra and bell, skulls, kīlas, etc., pictures of the forms of mandalas of inner deitieis, etc., because the mentalities of lower vehicles have no room, if such articles are shown to the less fortunate, they may become hostile; thus they should be concealed.

The Crystal Mountain Tantra:

If a holder of mantra endeavors in yoga, 
the māras become interested, 
endeavoring to cause breaks in commitments, 
since that it is so, understand this well.

It is stated in a thousand places that one needs to be careful in how Dzogchen teachings are promulgated. We cannot do anything about the samaya of other people, but we can guard our own samaya.

Malcolm wrote:
There are three kinds of gurus: gurus who give empowerments, gurus who give lungs, and gurus who give upadeshas. The best of course is the guru who gives all three. But to give a lung of a tantra means that people to whom one is giving the lung are becoming one's disciples. Thus it is not really a samaya-free transmission.

This means that people need to have empowerment, etc., before they can read said texts, even if they have received the lung. Otherwise, there is the root downfall of revealing secrets to the unripened. These are the kinds of things one has to take into consideration before one begins to act as a guide for others by giving them lungs, especially the seventeen tantras, which list severe punishments for promulgating them to unqualified recipients. Simply put, people should not read these texts if they are not qualified to do so.

Finally, frankly, most people in the west do not have a good understanding of this literature. People who do not have a good understanding of this literature and do not know Tibetan have no business givings lungs of translations of these texts, because they cannot correct errors when they find them. We must not assume that any translations of Dzogchen texts are perfect, and they all need to be explained point by point.

Malcolm wrote:
Nirmanakaya manifestations are necessarily physical. In any case, advanced bodhisattvas on the impure bhumis don’t need to attend empowerments at all. And since I live ten minutes from Tsegyalgar, I am very certain no first stage+ bodhisattvas are attending Elias’s retreat. Why would they want to? What would be the point?

As for nonhuman gurus, what did you have in mind, Nagas? Also here, even to see nonhuman beings one has to be a highly developed yogi.

Ok to clarify here, is Elias (or any other teacher) explicitly claiming there is no transmission taking place, or are they simply not doing DI in the style of Rinpoche and nothing this….likely due to expectations?

Malcolm wrote:
The present official position of the DC is that only Yeshe’s transmissions are considered valid. They are not recognizing other teachers who give transmission in ChNN’s stream, including Elias. This is why, for example, Fabio is telling people who,have done Mandarava retreats with Nina that they cannot attend his Mandarava Tsalujg retreat if they did not have transmission from either ChNN or Yeshe. So you see, despite the distractions caused by some random opinions in this thread, this is a very serious issue for the DC and they need to get their shit together.

The need for empowerment is, as you state, based on ordinary people entering the path, not bodhisattvas on the stages. I’d be very surprised if any bodhisattvas on the stages were attending any Dzogchen retreats at Tsegyalgar.

ChNN always stated that when people attended direct introduction in the many various ways he gave it, they get it, even if they do not recognize the experience in the beginning. Why?

Most countries in the Middle East and Afrixa gained their official independence after WWII. The Suez crisis in 1956 which Kim mentioned in his post marked a turning point where the new superpowers (US & USSR) took it as a chance to fill the vacuum left mainly by UK and France. This translated into proxy wars which ended by the collapse of the USSR and is currently reignited. From that perspective, US hegemony was short lived, and some historians would mark the end by the internal divisions in the US. It was the recklessness of George W Bush followed by Obama's doctrine of "leading from behind".

Also the world wars accelerated technological advancements and brought about new values that appears to break away with tradition by changing references. Technology provided leverage to the feminist movements and sex is being gradually replaced by gender and non-binary view of humans. The gold standard was abandoned in favor of the "free" market forces of supply and demand to determine the value of USD and to allow for sanctions to be effective. Fear of god is being replaced by fear of the prospects of AI on human destiny. Domestic concerns should be set aside in favor of more global concerns such as climate change.

As a dues-paying member of Dzogchen Community, this is my perspective:

You can't teach Dzogchen at all to someone who lacks direct introduction. Either the person teaching trekcho is giving teachings in a proper to way to people who have received or are receiving Dzogchen empowerments, or they are breaking their samaya. There is no two ways about it. This is as much on the Gakyil of Tsegyalgar as it is on Elias Caprilles himself.

Either one is confident in one's knowledge of Dzogchen and knows how to properly give Dzogchen transmission, which is detailed in myriad texts, or one is like someone who holds up the tail of a deer, but substitutes horse meat for venison in the customer's bag.

I am not commenting on whether Elias Caprilles is qualified to lead students on the path of Dzogchen or not. That's not up to me to decide. It's perfectly fine with me if Ellias, with whom I am acquainted, wishes to become a guru, undertaking to care for and be responsible for leading students to total liberation. However, this statement is total nonsense:

Malcolm wrote:
This is very stupid and misguided language. The DC should abandon it and be more honest. We can find thousands of citations where ChNN stated that the one indispensable thing in Dzogchen is direct introduction, without which there is no path of Dzogchen. Thus, it is impossible for someone who has not received Dzogchen transmission to participate in an "Experiential Trekchod Training Retreat." They simply are not qualified.

ChNN taught us that the role of a Dzogchen guru is to free people. Thus, this is not child's play or something that can be treated lightly. However, teaching Dzogchen to people with the idea that they can "can get transmission later" is completely misguided, and destroys both teacher and student alike, ruining their opportunity to attain liberation with this precious human birth in this lifetime.

Ukraine has shown it is just as much of a thing as it ever was. One must understand that the US military has the most accumulated experience of any army in the world. None of our so-called adversaries have a much combat experience as we do. If we were as willing to be as brutal as the Russians are in Ukraine...well, Iraq, Vietnam, etc. would have had very different endings.
