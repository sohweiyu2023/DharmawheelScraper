So what's a white or a red bindu? Blood cells? Tantra didn't know what cells were.

Vajrasambhava said:
What Malcolm is explaining (tell me if i'm wrong) is that these things are material and physical. Beacuse in Vajrayana all the channels, winds and bindus are made of subtle matter. So, even if is subtle it's still matter.

Malcolm wrote:
There are only six dhātus in the realm of buddhadharma, earth, air, fire, water, space, and consciousness. Anything that is not consciousness or space is matter. And in some tantric systems (Kālacakra specifically), even space is composed of matter.

The body is composed of refined matter, which is processed out of the food that we eat.

It is impossible to understand these systems of yoga without understanding the medical perspective of the human body that was held by the authors of the tantras, etc. People who ignore this just wind up creating a strange goulash of their own fabrications, not grounded in any text, based on whatever opinion  of day they are holding, as we see here. So as I said, I am out, this is not a serious place to discuss these issues or much of anything else connected with Dharma.

Yes, in fact we do. And those channels are very explicitly described, in detail, in the commentaries, as physical entities subject to growth, persistence, and decay. After 26 years of age, the 72000 nāḍīs decay at a regular rate.

The nāḍīs are held to be passageways. Passageways for what? Bindus, red bindus, white bindus, etc, which are moved around by vāyu (which just means air in Sanskrit). What do these bindus come from? Sixteen bindus come from our parents, eight red, and eight white. The rest comes from the food that we eat. Where do the five vāyus come from? The air we breath.

When we practice completion stage practices, as I said before, we visualize these channels as made of light, in bodies that we visualize as made of light. However, the bindus that are contained within them are physical, no? I mean, otherwise, what is it in karmamudra that one is retaining, reversing, spreading, and distributing uniformly? Light? What is the bliss in the body one is feeling? Merely visualized bliss or is it physical bliss?

Air doesn't make decisions. It's gas. The body metabolizes it. What governs in the cellular anatomy is mitochondria. There's no wisdom atom, like there is a gas atom. Yes, I'm referring to prājña.

Malcolm likes to diss Kalachakra as being about mythical kings. But for this, physical channels, it's right, because it gives him a chance to make propaganda about Tibetan medicine which he has an interest in. He says how we visualize is not how they exist in body. But how they exist in body is irrelevant. How we visualize is what we do with them. We practice yoga. They have no use without this. What's a yogi supposed to do with his aorta? It's nonsense. The tantras describe the embryo to show how we can reverse this process at death or conscious be reborn as Nirmanakaya.

In fact, has absolutely nothing do with an aorta. ChNN said the central channel is not physical. He said it doesn't matter what size you visualize. Tibetan medicine, like Ayurveda is antiquated using ancient modalities. Fire is not an element. Wind is not an element. Go see the periodic table of elements. There's no Mount Meru. There's no Jambudvipa. Alchemy is debunked. Astrology is debunked. All of these vestiges from the past in tantra need to be weeded out. The relevant part is peace of mind.

I'm waiting to see which vein is Lalana and rasana. Which 16 channels come out of the heart? Some completion stages make this important. Others don't. In some sense this but of tantra is outmoded as well.

Thank you.
But is it material? Afaik it can't be detected by any measuring instruments. I'm not really sure what physical but not material might mean. Electromagnetic fields are physical but not material.
If prana is physical, we should somehow detect it, no? Is it just a technological problem?

Malcolm wrote:
prāṇa vāyu is just inhaled air, If you stop breathing, you die. Apanā vayu is just the function of expelling feces, urine, sperm, menstrual blood, and babies, and farts. Samanā vayu is just the action of the small intestine on food. Udana vāyu is talking, etc.

All these functions are governed in general by the air element, which manifests in our experience as the motile quality of matter.

What has happened is that new age ideas about prāṇa have so infected our thinking, when we look at Buddhist texts, there are all these cobwebs we have ti peel from our eyes.

In particular, when it comes to anatomy, Tibetans were just better at it that the Chinese, Indians, Persians, and even the Greeks. The Tibetans cut up a lot more human bodies than any other culture in the world.

Crazywisdom said:

Malcolm wrote:
Not a gloss. The two obscurations are something to be purified in Vajrayāna. That does not mean they substantially exist. For example, Śākyamitra's Mahāmudrāyogāvatārapiṇḍārtha it states, "After migrating beings complete the accumulation of merit, they completely abandon the great mass of the two obscurations." Or Ratnarakṣita's commentary on the Laghusamvara, which states, "Gradually abandoning the two obscurations and accomplishing mahamudra to serve all migrating beings is the stated purpose."་ Even Tilopa states in his Mahāmudropadeśa:

For example, though darkness accumulates for a thousand eons,
the mass of darkness is dispelled by a single lamp;
likewise, a moment of the luminosity of one's mind
will dispel all misdeeds and obscurations gathered for an eon.

So, while one can certainly argue over method, one cannot argue that in order to attain buddhahood, one must abandon or remove the two obscurations.

Naropa, in his Sekkodeṣa commentary on the empowerments of Kālacakra, also discusses the need to abandon the two obscurations. In fact, he discusses four obscurations there, the usual two, plus obscurations of māra and samapatti.

Frankly, you are just not going to find Indian masters who negate the necessity of abandoning the two obscurations and gathering the two accumulations. Even in the Dzogchen tradition, this is necessary, as Khenpo Ngachung points out. The means may be different but the necessity is still there.

I have a basic difficulty in reconciling the two concepts that are mentioned in the subject heading of my post. My understanding of no-self and of the doctrine of rebirth is that there is no discrete, individually intact personhood that gets reborn; rather a (somewhat mysterious) stream of karmic effects and aspects of a life are what persists.

But the tulku seems to some degree like an example of a reborn personality, or individuality , even down to the ability to remember objects from a former existence.  I'm sure this difficulty, or apparent conflict, has been written about somewhere, but I'd be glad to hear your thoughts or be provided with references to look into.

By extension I have a similar curiosity about how to understand the apparently stable personhood or identity of beings identified in Vajrayana tradition (boddhisattvas, deities, dakinis).  They seem to preserve their identity or individual identifying marks in a way that transcends a single lifetime.

Grateful for your any helpful input. Thanks!

A superficial and merely technical understanding would probably concur.  It is interesting to note, however, how many practioners notice after 'beginning' with the Pali canon, before moving onto the 'higher view Mahayana/Vajrayana, that they eventually arrive at the fascinating 'destination of no destination' where they discover that, for example, the Four Noble Truths, are embedded within and experiently realised to be contained in the 'highest views'. It seems this is why the savviest teachers are not too keen on higher-lower discriminations.

The lower/higher dichotomies then become a source of ironic humour. informed by this, one can read again the Pali canon and the 'higher teachings and find the whole experience vibrates with instantaneous recognition and profound meaning. No differences, unless there is remaining a faulty determination to hold onto them.

Malcolm, do one get Vima Nyingthig empowerment as a part of Nyinthig Yabzhi empowerment only?

also, if a master gives Nyingthig Yabzhi empowerment (or any other major cycle empowernent for that matter), does it mean he/she is accomplished in this cycle?
i don't think i understand this point.
some masters are the lineage holders for so many cycles, like düdjom tersar, pema lingpa termas, northern treasures, longchen nyingthig etc., does that mean they have mastered them all, ie they not only give you a wang for a specific cycle, but are also accomplished in all of them and qualified to teach them, check your progress, understand your difficulties, correct mistakes, clear misunderstandings and give advice? not just give you a wang?

Dzogchen is Dzogchen, as they say gcig shes kun grol, knowing one liberates all. In this case, many lamas who have not mastered thogal beyond the second vision (and most lamas have not) nevertheless give Dzogchen empowerments and teachings. And, if you understand and have experience in Dzogchen, one does not need to "master" all these cycles to teach them (providing you have received them), since the basic points of Dzogchen man ngag sde are identical in every system. The main difference will be whatever yidams are associated with this or that cycle as supports. For example, ChNN freely picked and chose from what he considered the best from older termas, and presented them in that way, not bothering to or even thinking it necessary to give the entire cycle from which this or that Dzogchen instruction was drawn. At base, Nyinthig Dzogchen practice is summed up in four points: mind-training, rushan, trekcho, and thogal. The rest of it is ancillary. For example, to practice Yeshe Lama, all you really need is the empowerment of Thigle Gyacan, and the lung and rig pa'i rtsal wang of Ye shes lama. You don't need the entire Longchen Nyinthig. Just the Dzogchen portion.

Right this moment, how does this apply? This cup next to me I grasp with my senses, with my hand, with my cognition, this form, how is it empty? I grasp it as an object, a thing out there, separate to me and to other objects, but how can this be so, since it is unable to be except in relation to others. The table supports it. Light travels from it to my eyes and the signal is then relayed to the brain. It hold my coffee, which gives it its identity as a cup - its function of holding a liquid. Etc Etc... When I start experiencing the world around me, not as a collection of discrete entities separate to me , myself separated from the world of things, but rather a flow of relationships, of phenomena, the grasping loosens a little.

"No form, no feeling..." How can there be no feeling? That pushes me to investigate feeling. What is it? Does it arise, does it change? Does it cease? What is it before I label it this or that? Pay careful attention to it. Are there different kinds? Etc..

Zhen Li said:
Where Drewes is mistaken, I think, is continuing to simply ignore passages that refer to books when he suggests that writing and books were not important or worshipped in the Mahāyāna. Also, he conflates (purposefully?) Schopen's claim that the sūtras were worshipped in homes or shrines rather than caityas (there are sūtras in caityas in Nepal btw) as a rejection of the idea of book worship.

Malcolm wrote:
For example, when Mahāsiddha Virūpa (8th-9th century) was in South India, having been recruited as by a Hindu King for his expertise in Sanskrit, he was busted for prostrating to a copy of the Aṣṭasāhasrikā rather than a Śiva linga. One can well imagine that taking this sūtra as an object of devotion was extremely common, particularly among the educated, Buddhist elites. It's my personal favorite, along with the Saṃcayagathas.

Zhen Li said:
There are also stele of the Prajñāpāramitā Devī indicating book worship at the base, not to mention the original idea of putting the Prajñāpāramitā pustaka on the lotuses of Prajñāpāramitā Devī as well as Cundā and Mañjuśrī and others is clearly playing on the idea that Buddhists worship these books.

Manuscripts from the time are also covered in vermillion and incense stains, just like images. This hardly makes sense if Buddhists were just producing them en masse just to stuff them away in a library. Besides its constant appearance in Mahāyāna sūtras, the Śikṣāsamuccaya and a number of other śāstras bring this up multiple times as an important part of practice.

I think this also relates to the idea prevelant in a lot of Buddhist practices that you cannot "just read" a sūtra. You have to honour it first. In East Asia it has been reduced to a verse, but in Nepal the ritual that precedes opening a sūtra can take half an hour to perform. One example of this procedure in Tibetan is found in Tōh. no. 4252, Pustakapāṭhopāya. I am not sure if Tibetans have the idea that you must consecrate a sūtra also before using it in rituals, but that is certainly prevelant in Nepal and appears in the Kriyāsaṃgrahapañjikā of Kuladatta.

The idea that everyone who has not gotten vaccinated is some rural strictly ideological right wing conspiracy nut holed up in his shed is just not accurate at all, even when just looking at demographics of who is lagging. It's exactly the kind of media-created blinder that makes white liberal America constantly shoot itself in the foot. If anything I think it's apathetic young people that people should be worried about when concerned with vaccine hesitancy. Purely anecdotal, but of all the conversations I've had or overheard about people justifying not getting vaccinated, young people saying they weren't doing it because they weren't worried about dying were a good chunk.

Where Drewes is mistaken, I think, is continuing to simply ignore passages that refer to books when he suggests that writing and books were not important or worshipped in the Mahāyāna. Also, he conflates (purposefully?) Schopen's claim that the sūtras were worshipped in homes or shrines rather than caityas (there are sūtras in caityas in Nepal btw) as a rejection of the idea of book worship.

For example, when Mahāsiddha Virūpa (8th-9th century) was in South India, having been recruited as by a Hindu King for his expertise in Sanskrit, he was busted for prostrating to a copy of the Aṣṭasāhasrikā rather than a Śiva linga. One can well imagine that taking this sūtra as an object of devotion was extremely common, particularly among the educated, Buddhist elites. It's my personal favorite, along with the Saṃcayagathas.

Zhen Li said:
I think Drewes' thesis here is correct. Supposed contradictions between Mahāyāna sūtras are clearly outweighed by that which they have in common and there are no explicit rejections of sūtras or doctrines, only claims to supercede alternative views. His other claim that people who viewed themselves as bodhisattvas viewed themselves as being such for many lives and not as having originated the corpus but as revealing it, is also illustrative.

The point about terminology is also incisive. Vaipulya, vevulla, or vaitulya sūtra instead of Mahāyāna sūtra makes a lot of sense. In the eyes of a Mahāyānist what distinguishes these sūtras? Surely it is their length and profundity. If it took so long for Buddhists to differentiate Mahāyāna from non-Mahāyāna, these may have been seen simply as the long and profound sūtras among the shorter āgamas sūtras.

Where Drewes is mistaken, I think, is continuing to simply ignore passages that refer to books when he suggests that writing and books were not important or worshipped in the Mahāyāna. Also, he conflates (purposefully?) Schopen's claim that the sūtras were worshipped in homes or shrines rather than caityas (there are sūtras in caityas in Nepal btw) as a rejection of the idea of book worship. Most of the Mahāyāna sūtras advocate writing them and worshipping them in book form, even in the same sentences in which readers are encouraged to memorise and recite them. In most pre-modern cultures with the use of books, they are used not in place of oral cultures but in support of them. The sūtras clearly advocate both the writing and worship of the sūtras in book form, and their memorisation and recitation. This is what still happens today in most Buddhist cultures with anything except the longest vaipulya sūtras. Even then, sections are extracted for memorisation and recitation, like the Universal Gate Chapter of the Lotus Sūtra. There are references to book worship in Indian sources starting as early as Faxian and throughout the śāstra materials, it continues in most Buddhist cultures. I sense he is sticking to his guns and assuming everyone is onboard with him, when it is glaringly obvious that he should admit that he may have gone a bit far at some points.

There are several issues here. Firstly, the argument that the science is not settled was advanced to support the position that one has grounds for being cautious about getting vaccinated. It may well be that on the balance the right decision is indeed to vaccinate, but this doesn't mean that everyone who doesn't see it that way is an idiot.

Yeah, they pretty much are.

Dan74 said:
As to the actual question "do we know enough", three months ago when we got vaccinated, I thought so. Since then the cardiac inflammation stuff came out, but didn't significantly alter my view, but now we get some worrying data from Israel and the US, pointing to the current vaccines lasting for a short time and potentially offering no protection insofar as getting infected and spreading the virus is concerned.

Malcolm wrote:
No. The mRNA vaccines are still effective after six months:

As for cardiac inflammation:

https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/04/health/myocarditis-covid-vaccine.html

Dan74 said:
For every one million Americans immunized with a coronavirus vaccine, about 60 develop temporary heart problems, according to a study published on Wednesday in the journal JAMA Network.

The complications were all short-lived, the researchers found. And these heart problems are far more common among patients who develop Covid-19, outside experts noted.
It seems to me that we could be heading into the antibiotic disaster-like situation. Antibiotics were being overprescribed and as the result drug-resistant bugs were able to develop. Now with nearly a billion people receiving one shot of the vaccine, if they still catch the virus, that's a lot of opportunity for the virus to evolve vaccine resistant variants.

Malcolm wrote:
Part of the settled science behind vaccines is not allowing virus to spread uncontrolled so they can evolve vaccine-resistant varieties like Lambda. That is settled science. The nice thing about evolution is that it is governed by mathematical probabilities, so such variants can also be predicted.


Dan74 said:
I might be seeing it wrong, but there seems to be a danger there. If the vaccines are no longer effective at stemming the spread, but only the severity, then they are only a temporary stopgap, until a new resistant variant that might be very hard to vaccinate against evolves.

Malcolm wrote:
When people cast doubt on vaccines, they increase vaccine hesitancy. When vaccine hesitancy increases, more unvaccinated people become infected, and increase the possibility of mutations. At base it comes down to public health vs. personal health. The idea that people have a right to not take vaccines (barring a demonstrable threat to their health that overrides the public interest) has already been settled by the supreme court in the USA in the 1905 Jacobson v. Massachusetts decision:

“The good and welfare of the Commonwealth, of which the legislature is primarily the judge, is the basis on which the police power rests in Massachusetts,” Harlan said  “upon the principle of self-defense, of paramount necessity, a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.”

The issue of compulsory vaccinations for attendance of school was settled in 1922, Zucht v. King.

Heimdall said:
Hello everyone!

I'm an inquirer into Mahayana Buddhism (I'm currently attending a Zen Buddhist center at my temporary location; I'll be moving back to my main residence and have to find another Buddhist Temple / Center in a couple of weeks).

I wanted to get started reading, studying, and meditating on the Sutras, and considering that I'm not set in a specific school yet (due to these circumstances - there's a Zen place and Vietnamese place that both seem welcoming, but I'll have to check them out myself when I get there - who knows) - I've decided that the best place to start off are the bodies of text common to most traditions - namely the Tripitaka - as I was under the impression that most Mahayana schools use a Sanskrit or East-Asian language version of the Pali Canon and then build off of it with additional sutras - so I bought the "Long Discourses of the Buddha" translated from the Pali Digha Nikaya by Maurice Walshe. It was on sale for half off, so I bought it for $25.

However, to my dismay, I've found out after purchasing it that what I read online was only sort of true, because while it seems that there is incredible overlap between the Pali and Sanskrit / East-Asian canons such that they seem to be based off the same texts and early doctrines of the Buddha, the Pali canon has additional sutras not in the Sanskrit / East-Asian tradition and some sutras outright substantively differing in content.

So...with that being said...are the Therevada texts still seen as legitimate / orthodox / authentic by the Mahayanan Buddhists? Are they legitimately teachings by the Buddha? Are they worth reading? Is there anything "heretical" or wrong-view in these texts that I should be worried about?

Thanks.

Tyson Foods, one of the nation’s largest meat processors, said on Tuesday that it would require vaccines for its U.S. workers — about half of whom remain unvaccinated.

The mandate will extend to employees in its offices and in the field. The poultry supplier is requiring its leadership team to be vaccinated by Sept. 24 and the rest of its office workers by Oct. 1. Frontline employees have until Nov. 1 to be fully inoculated, extra time the company is providing because there are “significantly more frontline team members than office workers who still need to be vaccinated,” a Tyson spokesman said.

I suppose you support abortion rights as well, correct? It is after all the slogan of the pro-choice movement.

Now when it comes to choice about whether to be vaccinated or not:

Seitaka said:
State laws establish vaccination requirements for school children. These laws often apply not only to children attending public schools but also to those attending private schools and day care facilities. States may also require immunization of healthcare workers and of patients/residents of healthcare facilities.

Seitaka said:
Bodily autonomy and freedom of choice should be upheld at all costs because once rights and freedoms are taken, even if they are taken for a supposedly good cause or safety, they are rarely given back and therefore in the future can be subject to abuse.

Malcolm wrote:
This is false. For example, as above, all children in public school in the USA are required to receive vaccinations for mumps, measles, etc. Of course, if their parents choose not to school them in the public school system, they are free not to. But most schools require these vaccines for children, whether public or private.

Seitaka said:
Furthermore the institutions which are supporting the infringement of that bodily autonomy and freedom of choice (various governments, mass media, big tech, big corporations, etc.) are known to promote values, actions, and ways of thinking completely contrary to the Dharma, for example hedonism, licentiousness, materialism, and even sometimes outright hatred toward groups that they do not like. As such I am not sure why any Buddhist would place his trust in these institutions.

Malcolm wrote:
This is not the case. When, during the Buddha's day, monks committed civil crimes, they were turned over the civil authorities. The world at large has always promoted values, actions, and ways of thinking that are contrary to the Dharma. But we live in the world with other people. Therefore we have to get along with other people who are not Buddhists. This means we have to accommodate and adjust to the presence of governments, media, tech, large corporations.

If you live in a democracy, which you I assume you do, you should participate in your government. Otherwise, your voice will not be heard.

If you are not vaccinated against covid19, not only are being you irresponsible to your fellow citizens, but you are being stupid about your own health.

Things are dependently originated, and thus they are empty and dependently designated. This is the middle way.

I can't read the article because I don't subscribe, but from what I've read that was an atypical study demographically - big group of people flocking to one area.  It might mean something substantial on the larger scale or it might not, just like the viral load thing. Another issue is, AFAIK  a vaccinated testing positive for Covid does not necessarily imply tranmissability.

https://sfist.com/2021/07/22/delta-not-causing-more-breakthrough-covid-cases-expert-say-and-maybe-asymptomatic-cases-shouldnt-count/
Yes, the Delta variant is more contagious, but experts say there's little evidence so far that it's infecting more vaccinated people than would likely have been infected, statistically speaking, by any of the earlier variants. The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines also both seem to be highly effective at protecting people against getting sick from the Delta variant, but maybe only 80% effective at preventing infection completely.
BTW, It's people like Paul Offit saying stuff like this, not some kook: "I think we are misusing the term breakthrough," he says. "If someone who is fully vaccinated is subsequently hospitalized or killed by the virus, that's a breakthrough case."
he New York Times also discussed breakthrough cases today, reporting on a widely talked-about outbreak of cases that came out of Provincetown, Massachusetts, where an estimated 66,000 mostly gay people gathered into crowded spaces over the week of July Fourth. Around San Francisco, an unknown number of people who returned from Provincetown were infected and some anecdotally became sick — but the Provincetown Board of Health has only recorded 256 cases among the vaccinated, with 66 among people who then traveled home out of state (though this seems like a likely undercount). Even if the true number is three times that, it still represents a relatively small number among the tens of thousands of vaccinated people partying in Provincetown that week.
Etc...so, no, these small scale studies and findings are not proof of widespread infection among the vaccinated, and indeed so far there is no data for that. Might there be? Sure, we will have to see. Is it prudent to wear masks in mixed areas...yeah, I mean, to a degree it always was.

I n Sanskrit: Bhagavati prajnaparamitahrdaya
In Tibetan: Bcom Idan 'das ma shes rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa'I snying po
In English: The Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom, the Bhagavati

Thus have I once heard:

The Blessed One was staying in Rajagrha at Vulture Peak along with a great community of monks and great community of bodhisattvas, and at that time, the Blessed One fully entered the meditative concentration on the varieties of phenomena called the Appearance of the Profound. At that very time as well, holy Avalokitsevara, the bodhisattva, the great being, beheld the practice itself of the profound perfection of wisdom, and he even saw the five aggregates as empty of inherent nature. Thereupon, through the Buddha's inspiration, the venerable Sariputra spoke to holy Avalokitsevara, the bodhisattva, the great being, and said, "Any noble son who wishes to engage in the practice of the profound perfection of wisdom should train in what way?"

When this had been said, holy Avalokitsevara, the bodhisattva, the great being, spoke to venerable Sariputra and said, "Sariputra, any noble sons or daughters who wish to practice the perfection of wisdom should see this way: they should see insightfully, correctly, and repeatedly that even the five aggregates are empty of inherent nature. Form is empty, emptiness is form, Emptiness is not other than form, form is also not other than emptiness. Likewise, sensation, discrimination, conditioning, and awareness are empty. In this way, Sariputra, all things are emptiness; they are without defining characteristics; they are not born, they do not cease, they are not defiled, they are not undefiled. They have no increase, they have no decrease.

"Therefore, Sariputra, in emptiness there is no form, no sensation, no discrimination, no conditioning, and no awareness. There is no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind. There is no form, no sound, no smell, no taste, no texture, no phenomenon. There is no eye-element and so on up to no mind-element and also up to no element of mental awareness. There is no ignorance and no elimination of ignorance and so on up to no aging and death and no elimination of aging and death. Likewise, there is no suffering, origin, cessation, or path; there is no wisdom, no attainment, and even no non-attainment.

"Therefore, Sariputra, since the bodhisattvas have no obtainments, they abide relying on the perfection of wisdom. Having no defilements in their minds, they have no fear, and passing completely beyond error, they reach nirvana. Likewise, all the Buddhas abiding in the three times clearly and completely awaken to unexcelled, authentic, and complete awakening in dependence upon the perfection of wisdom.

"Therefore, one should know that the mantra of the perfection of wisdom - the mantra of great knowledge, the precious mantra, the unexcelled mantra, the mantra equal to the unequalled, the mantra that quells all suffering - is true because it is not deceptive. The mantra of the perfection of wisdom is proclaimed:

tadyatha - gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha!

Sariputra, a bodhisattva, a great being, should train in the profound perfection of wisdom in that way."

Thereupon, the Blessed One arose for that meditative concentration, and he commended holy Avalokitsevara, the bodhisattva, the great being. "Excellent!" he said. "Excellent! Excellent! Noble child, it is just so. Noble child, it is just so. One should practice the profound perfection of wisdom in the manner that you have revealed - the Tathagatas rejoice!" This is what the Blessed One said.

Thereupon, the venerable Sariputra, the holy Avalokitsevara, the bodhisattva, the great being, and that entire assembly along with the world of gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas, all rejoiced and highly praised what the Blessed One had said.

For years I have observed many people here waxing nostalgic about Dharma kings. This fantasy is deeply embedded in the Tibetan Buddhist imagination, even in westerners.

For example, such images permeate the lower initiations of Vajrayāna, superficially modeled on the coronation of an Indian monarch. Trungpa borrowed various customs from Asian countries, combined them with his imagination of British mannerisms, cooked this all up into a new dish, and served monarchism to western disciples. We still have people who take the Kālacakra empowerment stirred by utopian fantasies of a coming world paradise run by tenth-stage bodhisattva rulers, hoping to be reborn as soldiers in the army of Rudra Cakravartin. And of course we have famous Tibetan Buddhist teachers today who complain bitterly about Democracy on a regular basis.

And more to the point, virtually all of our lineage heads were religious rulers.

Of course, this sentiment is understandable in societies like Tibet, and basically everywhere else, which were run by despots, tyrants, and warlords. But such imagery, though evocative, is much less powerful in a Democratic society

That's a truth claim, see?

Malcolm wrote:
Not in any hard legal sense.

For example, another "truth" claim concerns the existence of a kingdom named Shambhala and a huge war that is supposed to happen with Muslims in 400 years or so. Some people take this literally. Other people see it as an allegory of a personal, spiritual battle, as it is presented in the gnosis chapter.

Kālacakra is recognized as a valid system today by everyone; but during the 14th century there was still considerable doubt about it's validity in Tibet.

All of these claims are truth claims for those who accept them, and are not truth claims for those who do not. For example, the treasure system is still widely rejected/ignored by many Tibetan Buddhists, especially in Geluk, Jonang, and more conservative bastions of Sakya.

So, in general, in Buddhadharma, one tends to ignore the scriptures for which one does not feel affinity, no one fears rejecting or ignoring the truth claims made by proponents of this or that school, and it has been this way since the rise of Mahāyāna, and even among śrāvaka schools we see this dynamic, i.e., "We don't read that sūtra, so it does not apply to us."



Crazywisdom said:
This is one of the bases to the claim that in this degenerate age, the Laghusamvara cycle is the most effective.
So if that's true it will be most effective. Is it? How can we know?

Malcolm wrote:
Well, practice five-fold Mahāmudra or Vajrayoginī in the Drigung system and find out.

I suspect these claims of effectiveness are a kind of puffery. Their validity rests on accepting certain assumptions.

The Laghusamvara system was certainly the most widely practiced tantric cycle in India. It has the most explanatory tantras, commentaries, and sādhanas. More of the Eighty-Four Mahāsiddhas practiced it than any other system. Today, it remains the most widely practice system in Tibetan Buddhism, extensively practiced in Sakya, Kagyu, and Gelug, with the central lineages in all three schools descending directly from Naropa, either through Mal Lotsawa Rinchen Drak (Sakya, Geluk) or Marpa Lotsawa (Dwagpo Kagyu, Geluk), and is practiced more widely than Hevajra, Guhyasamāja, Kālacakra, not to mention more obscure systems like Caturpitha, Mahāmaya, Candamahārośana, Buddhakāpala, and so on.

But more importantly, for Indians, the origin story of Heruka of the Laghusamvara has everything to do with the conquest of Shiva and Umadevi, sited in and around places in India that people actually travelled to and at one point, could identify with certainty. Later, when these pithas, upithas, and so on became less identifiable, the pilgrimage became an inner one, with the Ghantapāda body mandala system, etc.

None of these claims can be verified in any sort of objective way for anyone but oneself.

Hello all - hope you're well. I'm writing with a question regarding a refuge name I received.

I was previously a member of the Shambhala community, which (as I'm sure many know) has been up-ended by the revelation of an abuse scandal (both recent and historical). I took refuge with a representative of the so-called "Sakyong" before all of this was revealed - I was given a refuge name. I consider refuge names to be tools for self-reflection. Somehow, after everything that has happened, I feel as though that name (that tool)) isn't even valid since it was conferred by someone who I do not consider to be a legitimate teacher. I am writing to get opinions on how to relate to this name given the circumstances. Is it a legitimate tool for me, or something to disregard?

This is purely a psychological issue for me and may seem trivial, but that name feels like some sort of tether tying me to the "Sakyong," that community and the whole situation. The reality of the situation is that I want nothing to do with it and do not want to be tethered to it psychologically or otherwise. That is why it is eating me up. I'd appreciate any advice anyone may have.

It's an interesting issue. So in Guhyagarbha the wrathful mandala chapter 15 gives this long story about how Heruka tamed Tarpa Nagpo. It is an allegory. An allegory has a purpose, it is meant to crystalize a value. In this case the value is the most essential point of tantra, the mandala, mantra, etc.

In the case of Ramayana and Bhagavat Gita probably these are somewhat like that, but these were contrived by Brahmins establish themselves as the heirs of Rishis, the kingmakers and right hand to ancient bloodlines. So, total lie. Motives for control.

In the tantra example you give, it would fall under allegory. And Buddhist tantra tends to try to use allegory like this to upend the status quo, which was Brahmanism.

Malcolm wrote:
Only in a most narrow, literalist sense. And there are myriad strategies to justify what people set down as the words of the Buddha, from declaring the Buddha never said anything to the idea that the Buddha's words are interpreted variably by whoever hears them. When it comes to the Tantras, for example, they do not even necessarily claim to be taught by the Buddha. For example, the tradition of the Laghusamvara Tantra claims it was never taught by the historical Buddha, but rather, by the nirmāṇakāya who presently dwells in the twenty-four places in Jambudvipa. Is this a lie, a legend, or a myth?

Crazywisdom said:
Bronkworst uses his method to prove or attempt at least that there are many things in the canon which Buddha never taught. I think most relevant to this discussion is liberating knowledge. He is more or less saying Buddha never talked much about the emptiness of dharmas and therefore that all of Mahayana and  Vajrayana would have to be the fruit of a particular school of scholars who focused on that being the most important point. Whereas, for Buddha it was one important point but not the most important point. The most important point was seeing the end of suffering.

Malcolm wrote:
Sure, but I brought up Bronkhorst mainly because his research calls into question a lot of earlier European ideas about India circa 400 BCE, ideas which have been widely adopted by Indians as well as Westerners. As to your last point, there are many Theravadins who would likely agree with him.

Crazywisdom said:
Insofar as the emptiness of skandhas are the emptiness of dharmas, of course the Mahayana, like Heart Sutra and Vajrayana like mandala of five dhyani buddhas is useful, like a tool in a toolbox of tools, but I'm afraid unnecessary. They lead to the same point, perhaps with better precision. But the fanciful notions about buddhahood being the major and minor marks, emanations on planeta and all that are in the category of uselessness.

Malcolm wrote:
The PP Sūtras dispensed with the idea of buddhahood being identifiable in characteristics.

Likewise, Mahayana arose at the same time as the Ramayana and so on, use similar themes, etc. Is the Ramayana or the Bhagavad Gita a lie? Did Ravanna conspire to steal Sita? Was there ever even a person named Ravanna or Sita?  If there was never a person named Ravanna, then what does that do to the credibility of the Lanka in your view?

Or what about the fact that the Blazing Tongue of the Dakini tantra, the principle source on the origins of Mahakala and Mahakali, borrows the narrative of Shiva destroying Tripura in order to explain the origins of Mahakala and borrows the narrative of Ravanna  seducing Sita to explain the origins of Shri Devi and Remati? Is this a lie, or is there something else to be considered in these examples?

You seem to be making the claim that if the Mahayana sutras and tantras do not portray actual historical events, if tales of the lineage like Buddha flying to Oddiyana to meet Indrabhuti I, or giving the Kalacakra inside a stupa in South India, are dramatic stories rather than historical events, it’s all a bust.

The Abhidharma is the original attempt to systematize the disordered nature of the Buddha's oral teachings.

The Sarvastivadins were more honest, and asserted they were the summaries of the Dharma by senior arhats.

Title: Xi's Gamble
Content:
Malcolm wrote:
An article in Foreign Affairs:


Xi’s Gamble
The Race to Consolidate Power and Stave Off Disaster

By July/August 2021

Xi Jinping is a man on a mission. After coming to power in late 2012, he moved rapidly to consolidate his political authority, purge the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) of rampant corruption, sideline his enemies, tame China’s once highflying technology and financial conglomerates, crush internal dissent, and forcefully assert China’s influence on the international stage. In the name of protecting China’s “core interests,” Xi has picked fights with many of his neighbors and antagonized countries farther away—especially the United States. Whereas his immediate predecessors believed China must continue to bide its time by overseeing rapid economic growth and the steady expansion of China’s influence through tactical integration into the existing global order, Xi is impatient with the status quo, possesses a high tolerance for risk, and seems to feel a pronounced sense of urgency in challenging the international order.

Why is he in such a rush? Most observers have settled on one of two diametrically opposite hypotheses. The first holds that Xi is driving a wide range of policy initiatives aimed at nothing less than the remaking of the global order on terms favorable to the CCP. The other view asserts that he is the anxious overseer of a creaky and outdated Leninist political system that is struggling to keep its grip on power. Both narratives contain elements of truth, but neither satisfactorily explains the source of Xi’s sense of urgency.

A more accurate explanation is that Xi’s calculations are determined not by his aspirations or fears but by his timeline. Put simply, Xi has consolidated so much power and upset the status quo with such force because he sees a narrow window of ten to 15 years during which Beijing can take advantage of a set of important technological and geopolitical transformations, which will also help it overcome significant internal challenges. Xi sees the convergence of strong demographic headwinds, a structural economic slowdown, rapid advances in digital technologies, and a perceived shift in the global balance of power away from the United States as what he has called “profound changes unseen in a century,” demanding a bold set of immediate responses.

By narrowing his vision to the coming ten to 15 years, Xi has instilled a sense of focus and determination in the Chinese political system that may well enable China to overcome long-standing domestic challenges and achieve a new level of global centrality. If Xi succeeds, China will position itself as an architect of an emerging era of multipolarity, its economy will escape the so-called middle-income trap, and the technological capabilities of its manufacturing sector and military will rival those of more developed countries.

Yet ambition and execution are not the same thing, and Xi has now placed China on a risky trajectory, one that threatens the achievements his predecessors secured in the post-Mao era. His belief that the CCP must guide the economy and that Beijing should rein in the private sector will constrain the country’s future economic growth. His demand that party cadres adhere to ideological orthodoxy and demonstrate personal loyalty to him will undermine the governance system’s flexibility and competency. His emphasis on an expansive definition of national security will steer the country in a more inward and paranoid direction. His unleashing of “Wolf Warrior” nationalism will produce a more aggressive and isolated China. Finally, Xi’s increasingly singular position within China’s political system will forestall policy alternatives and course corrections, a problem made worse by his removal of term limits and the prospect of his indefinite rule.

Xi believes he can mold China’s future as did the emperors of the country’s storied past. He mistakes this hubris for confidence—and no one dares tell him otherwise. An environment in which an all-powerful leader with a single-minded focus cannot hear uncomfortable truths is a recipe for disaster, as China’s modern history has demonstrated all too well.

A MAN IN A HURRY

In retrospect, Xi’s compressed timeline was clear from the start of his tenure. China had become accustomed to the pace of his predecessor, the slow and staid Hu Jintao, and many expected Xi to follow suit, albeit with a greater emphasis on economic reform. Yet within months of taking the reins in 2012, Xi began to reorder the domestic political and economic landscape. First came a top-to-bottom housecleaning of the CCP. The party had repeatedly demonstrated its ability to weather domestic storms, but pressures were building within the system. Corruption had become endemic, leading to popular dissatisfaction and the breakdown of organizational discipline. The party’s ranks were growing rapidly but were increasingly filled with individuals who didn’t share Xi’s belief in the CCP’s exceptionalism. Party cells in state-owned enterprises, private companies, and nongovernmental organizations were dormant and disorganized. Senior-level decision-making had become uncoordinated and siloed. The party’s propaganda organs struggled to project their messages to an increasingly cynical and tech-savvy citizenry.

Xi took on all these problems simultaneously. In 2013 alone, he initiated a sweeping anticorruption drive, launched a “mass line” campaign to eliminate political pluralism and liberal ideologies from public discourse, announced new guidelines restricting the growth of the party’s membership, and added new ideological requirements for would-be party members. The size of the party mattered little, he believed, if it was not made up of true believers. After all, he noted, when the Soviet Union was on the brink of collapse in the early 1990s, “proportionally, the Soviet Communist Party had more members than [the CCP], but nobody was man enough to stand up and resist.”

Xi Jinping is a man on a mission.
Next on Xi’s agenda was the need to assert China’s interests on the global stage. Xi quickly began land reclamation efforts in the South China Sea, established an air defense identification zone over disputed territory in the East China Sea, helped launch the New Development Bank (sometimes called the BRICS Bank), unveiled the massive international infrastructure project that came to be known as the Belt and Road Initiative, and proposed the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.

Xi continued to slash his way through the status quo for the remainder of his first term and shows no signs of abating as he approaches the end of his second. His consolidation of power continues uninterrupted: he faces no genuine political rivals, has removed term limits on his tenure in office, and has installed allies and loyalists in key positions. New research centers are dedicated to studying his writings and speeches, party officials publicly extol his wisdom and virtue, and party regulations and government planning documents increasingly claim to be based on “Xi Jinping Thought.” He has asserted the CCP’s dominance over vast swaths of Chinese society and economic life, even forcing influential business and technology titans to beg forgiveness for their insufficient loyalty to the party. Meanwhile, he continues to expand China’s international sphere of influence through the exercise of hard power, economic coercion, and deep integration into international and multilateral bodies.

Many outside observers, myself included, initially believed that the party’s inability to contain the outbreak of COVID-19 highlighted the weaknesses of China’s system. By the summer of 2020, however, Xi was able to extol the virtues of centralized control in checking the pandemic’s domestic spread. Far from undermining his political authority, Beijing’s iron-fisted approach to combating the virus has now become a point of national pride.

A UNIQUE MOMENT

Xi’s fast pace was provoked by a convergence of geopolitical, demographic, economic, environmental, and technological changes. The risks they pose are daunting, but not yet existential; Beijing has a window of opportunity to address them before they become fatal. And the potential rewards they offer are considerable.

The first major change is Beijing’s assessment that the power and influence of the West have entered a phase of accelerated decline, and as a result, a new era of multipolarity has begun, one that China could shape more to its liking. This view took hold as the U.S. wars in Afghanistan and Iraq became quagmires, and it solidified in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, which the Chinese leadership saw as the death knell for U.S. global prestige. In 2016, the British vote to leave the European Union and the election of Donald Trump as president in the United States fortified the consensus view that the United States, and the West more generally, was in decline. This might suggest that China could opt for strategic patience and simply allow American power to wane. But the possibility of a renewal of U.S. leadership brought about by the advent of the Biden administration—and concerns about Xi’s mortality (he will be 82 in 2035)—means that Beijing is unwilling to wait and see how long this phase of Western decline will last.

The second important force confronting Xi is China’s deteriorating demographic and economic outlook. By the time he assumed office, China’s population was simultaneously aging and shrinking, and the country was facing an imminent surge of retirees that would stress the country’s relatively weak health-care and pension systems. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences now expects China’s population to peak in 2029, and a recent study in The Lancet forecast that it will shrink by nearly 50 percent by the end of the century. Although Beijing ended its draconian one-child policy in 2016, the country has still recorded a 15 percent decline in births during the past 12 months. Meanwhile, the government estimates that by 2033, nearly one-third of the population will be over the age of 60.

Contributing to these woes is China’s shrinking workforce and rising wages, which have increased by ten percent, on average, since 2005. Larger paychecks are good for workers, but global manufacturers are increasingly moving their operations out of China and to lower-cost countries, leaving a rising number of low-skilled workers in China unemployed or underemployed. And because only 12.5 percent of China’s labor force has graduated from college (compared with 24 percent in the United States), positioning the bulk of the country’s workforce to compete for the high-skilled jobs of the future will be an uphill battle.

Directly related to this worrying demographic picture is the slowdown of China’s economy. With annual GDP growth having dropped from a high of 14 percent in 2007 to the mid-single digits today, many of the long-standing problems Beijing had been able to sweep under the rug now require attention and a willingness to accept economic and political pain, from unwinding the vast sea of indebted companies to demanding that firms and individuals pay more into the country’s tax coffers. At the heart of China’s growth woes is flagging productivity. Throughout the first several decades of the post-Mao reform period, realizing productivity gains was relatively straightforward, as the planned economy was dissolved in favor of market forces and droves of citizens voluntarily fled the countryside for urban and coastal areas and the promise of higher-wage jobs. Later, as foreign companies brought investment, technology, and know-how to the country, industrial efficiency continued to improve. Finally, the massive amounts spent on infrastructure, especially roads and rail, boosted connectivity and thus productivity. All of this helped a poor and primarily agricultural economy rapidly catch up with more advanced economies.

Yet by the time Xi assumed power, policymakers were finding it increasingly difficult to maintain momentum without creating unsustainable levels of debt, just as they had done in response to the 2008 global financial crisis. What is more, the country was already saturated with transportation infrastructure, so an additional mile of road or high-speed rail wasn’t going to add much to growth. And because almost all able-bodied workers had already moved from the countryside to urban areas, relocating labor wouldn’t arrest the decline in productivity, either. Finally, the social and environmental costs of China’s previous growth paradigm had become both unsustainable and destabilizing, as staggering air pollution and environmental devastation provoked acute anger among Chinese citizens.

Perhaps the most consequential shifts to have occurred on Xi’s watch are advances in new technologies such as artificial intelligence, robotics, and biomedical engineering, among others. Xi believes that dominating the “commanding heights” of these new tools will play a critical role in China’s economic, military, and geopolitical fate, and he has mobilized the party to transform the country into a high-tech powerhouse. This includes expending vast sums to develop the country’s R & D and production capabilities in technologies deemed critical to national security, from semiconductors to batteries. As Xi stated in 2014, first-mover advantage will go to “whoever holds the nose of the ox of science and technology innovation.”

Xi also hopes that new technologies can help the CCP overcome, or at least circumvent, nearly all of China’s domestic challenges. The negative impacts of a shrinking workforce, he believes, can be blunted by an aggressive push toward automation, and job losses in traditional industries can be offset by opportunities in newer, high-tech sectors. “Whether we can stiffen our back in the international arena and cross the ‘middle-income trap’ depends to a large extent on the improvement of science and technology innovation capability,” Xi said in 2014.

New technologies serve other purposes, as well. Facial recognition tools and artificial intelligence give China’s internal security organs new ways to surveil citizens and suppress dissent. The party’s “military-civil fusion” strategy strives to harness these new technologies to significantly bolster the Chinese military’s warfighting capabilities. And advances in green technology offer the prospect of simultaneously pursuing economic growth and pollution abatement, two goals Beijing has generally seen as being in tension.

THE PARANOID STYLE IN CHINESE POLITICS

This convergence of changes and developments would have occurred regardless of who assumed power in China in 2012. Perhaps another leader would have undertaken a similarly bold agenda. Yet among contemporary Chinese political figures, Xi has demonstrated an unrivaled skill for bureaucratic infighting. And he clearly believes that he is a figure of historical significance, on whom the CCP’s fate rests.

In order to push forward significant change, Xi has overseen the construction of a new political order, one underpinned by a massive increase in the power and authority of the CCP. Yet beyond this elevation of party power, perhaps Xi’s most critical legacy will be his expansive redefinition of national security. His advocacy of a “comprehensive national security concept” emerged in early 2014, and in a speech that April, he announced that China faced “the most complicated internal and external factors in its history.” Although this was clearly hyperbole—war with the United States in Korea and the nationwide famine of the late 1950s were more complicated—Xi’s message to the political system was clear: a new era of risk and uncertainty confronts the party.

The CCP’s long experience of defections, attempted coups, and subversion by outside actors predisposes it to acute paranoia, something that reached a fever pitch in the Mao era. Xi risks institutionalizing this paranoid style. One result of blurring the line between internal and external security has been threat inflation: party cadres in low-crime, low-risk areas now issue warnings of terrorism, “color revolutions,” and “Christian infiltration.” In Xinjiang, fears of separatism have been used to justify turning the entire region into a dystopian high-tech prison. And in Hong Kong, Xi has established a “national security” bureaucracy that can ignore local laws and operate in total secrecy as it weeds out perceived threats to Beijing’s iron-fisted rule. In both places, Xi has demonstrated that he is willing to accept international opprobrium when he feels that the party’s core interests are at stake.

At home, Xi stokes nationalist sentiment by framing China as surrounded and besieged by enemies, exploiting a deeply emotional (and highly distorted) view of the past, and romanticizing China’s battles against the Japanese in World War II and its “victory” over the United States in the Korean War. By warning that China has entered a period of heightened risk from “hostile foreign forces,” Xi is attempting to accommodate Chinese citizens to the idea of more difficult times ahead and ensure that the party and he himself are viewed as stabilizing forces.

Xi has placed China on a risky trajectory, one that threatens the achievements his predecessors secured.
Meanwhile, to exploit a perceived window of opportunity during an American retreat from global affairs, Beijing has advanced aggressively on multiple foreign policy fronts. These include the use of “gray zone” tactics, such as employing commercial fishing boats to assert territorial interests in the South China Sea and establishing China’s first overseas military base, in Djibouti. China’s vast domestic market has allowed Xi to threaten countries that don’t demonstrate political and diplomatic obedience, as evidenced by Beijing’s recent campaign of economic coercion against Australia in response to Canberra’s call for an independent investigation into the origins of the virus that causes COVID-19. Similarly, Xi has encouraged Chinese “Wolf Warrior” diplomats to intimidate and harass host countries that criticize or otherwise antagonize China. Earlier this year, Beijing levied sanctions against Jo Smith Finley, a British anthropologist and political scientist who studies Xinjiang, and the Mercator Institute for China Studies, a German think tank, whose work the CCP claimed had “severely harm[ed] China’s sovereignty and interests.”

Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping demonstrated strategic patience in asserting China’s interests on the global stage. Indeed, Mao told U.S. President Richard Nixon that China could wait 100 years to reclaim Taiwan, and Deng negotiated the return of Hong Kong under the promise (since broken by Xi) of a 50-year period of local autonomy. Both leaders had a profound sense of China’s relative fragility and the importance of careful, nuanced statesmanship. Xi does not share their equanimity, or their confidence in long-term solutions.

That has sparked concerns that Xi will attempt an extraordinarily risky gambit to take Taiwan by force by 2027, the 100th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Liberation Army. It seems doubtful, however, that he would invite a possible military conflict with the United States just 110 miles from China’s shoreline. Assuming the PLA were successful in overcoming Taiwan’s defenses, to say nothing of surmounting possible U.S. involvement, Xi would then have to carry out a military occupation against sustained resistance for an indeterminate length of time. An attempted takeover of Taiwan would undermine nearly all of Xi’s other global and domestic ambitions. Nevertheless, although the more extreme scenarios might remain unlikely for the time being, Xi will continue to have China flaunt its strength in its neighborhood and push outward in pursuit of its interests. On many issues, he appears to want final resolution on his watch.

THE MAN OF THE SYSTEM

Xi’s tendency to believe he can shape the precise course of China’s trajectory calls to mind the economist Adam Smith’s description of “the man of system”: a leader “so enamored with the supposed beauty of his own ideal plan of government, that he cannot suffer the smallest deviation from any part of it.” In order to realize his near-term goals, Xi has abandoned the invisible hand of the market and forged an economic system that relies on state actors to reach predetermined objectives.

Critical to this shift has been Xi’s reliance on industrial policy, a tool of economic statecraft that had fallen out of favor until near the end of the tenure of Xi’s predecessor, Hu, when it began to shape Beijing’s approach to technological innovation. The year 2015 marked an important inflection point, with the introduction of supersized industrial policy programs that sought not just to advance a given technology or industry but also to remake the entire structure of the economy. These included the Made in China 2025 plan, which aims to upgrade China’s manufacturing capabilities in a number of important sectors; the Internet Plus strategy, a scheme to integrate information technology into more traditional industries; and the 14th Five-Year Plan, which outlines an ambitious agenda to decrease China’s reliance on foreign technology inputs. Through such policies, Beijing channels tens of trillions of yuan into companies, technologies, and sectors it considers strategically significant. It does this by means of direct subsidies, tax rebates, and quasi-market “government guidance funds,” which resemble state-controlled venture capital firms.

Thus far, Beijing’s track record in this area is decidedly mixed: in many cases, vast sums of investment have produced meager returns. But as the economist Barry Naughton has cautioned, “Chinese industrial policies are so large, and so new, that we are not yet in a position to evaluate them. They may turn out to be successful, but it is also possible that they will turn out to be disastrous.”

Xi believes he can mold China’s future as did the emperors of the country’s storied past.
Related to this industrial policy is Xi’s approach to China’s private-sector companies, including many of the technological and financial giants that just a few years ago observers viewed as possible agents of political and social change. Technological innovation put firms such as Ant Group and Tencent in control of critical new data flows and financial technology. Xi clearly perceived this as an unacceptable threat, as demonstrated by the CCP’s recent spiking of Ant Group’s initial public offering in the wake of comments made by its founder, Jack Ma, that many perceived as critical of the party.

Xi is willing to forgo a boost in China’s international financial prestige to protect the party’s interests and send a signal to business elites: the party comes first. This is no David and Goliath story, however. It’s more akin to a family feud, given the close and enduring connections between China’s nominally private firms and its political system. Indeed, nearly all of China’s most successful entrepreneurs are members of the CCP, and for many companies, success depends on favors granted by the party, including protection from foreign competition. But whereas previous Chinese leaders granted wide latitude to the private sector, Xi has forcefully drawn a line. Doing so has further restricted the country’s ability to innovate. No matter how sophisticated Beijing’s regulators and state investors may be, sustained innovation and gains in productivity cannot occur without a vibrant private sector.

GRAND STRATEGY OR GRAND TRAGEDY?

In order to seize temporary advantages and forestall domestic challenges, Xi has positioned himself for a 15-year race, one for which he has mobilized the awesome capabilities of a system that he now commands unchallenged. Xi’s truncated time frame compels a sense of urgency that will define Beijing’s policy agenda, risk tolerance, and willingness to compromise as it sprints ahead. This will narrow the options available to countries hoping to shape China’s behavior or hoping that the “Wolf Warrior” attitude will naturally recede.

The United States can disprove Beijing’s contention that its democracy has atrophied and that Washington’s star is dimming by strengthening the resilience of American society and improving the competence of the U.S. government. If the United States and its allies invest in innovation and human capital, they can forestall Xi’s efforts to gain first-mover advantage in emerging and critical technologies. Likewise, a more active and forward-looking U.S. role in shaping the global order would limit Beijing’s ability to spread illiberal ideas beyond China’s borders.

Unwittingly, Xi has put China into competition with itself, in a race to determine if its many strengths can outstrip the pathologies that Xi himself has introduced to the system. By the time he assumed power, the CCP had established a fairly predictable process for the regular and peaceful transition of power. Next fall, the 20th Party Congress will be held, and normally, a leader who has been in charge as long as Xi has would step aside. To date, however, there is no expectation that Xi will do so. This is an extraordinarily risky move, not just for the CCP itself but also for the future of China. With no successor in sight, if Xi dies unexpectedly in the next decade, the country could be thrown into chaos.

Even assuming that Xi remains healthy while in power, the longer his tenure persists, the more the CCP will resemble a cult of personality, as it did under Mao. Elements of this are already evident, with visible sycophancy among China’s political class now the norm. Paeans to the greatness of “Xi Jinping Thought” may strike outsiders as merely curious or even comical, but they have a genuinely deleterious effect on the quality of decision-making and information flows within the party.

It would be ironic, and tragic, if Xi, a leader with a mission to save the party and the country, instead imperiled both. His current course threatens to undo the great progress China has made over the past four decades. In the end, Xi may be correct that the next decade will determine China’s long-term success. What he likely does not understand is that he himself may be the biggest obstacle.

More to the point, does it actually matter if these things happened in history, or is the content and message of these texts more important?

If you decided that these events did not happen in history, that they were a kind of religious fictional narrative, would you lose confidence in Mahāyāna teachings? And if you did lose confidence in Mahāyāna teachings, wouldn't that mean the provenance of a teaching is more important to you than its doctrine?

When it comes to history, I read historians; when it comes to tenets, I read panditas; when it comes to the meaning of sūtras, I read the charioteers, Nāgārjuna, and the rest; when it comes to Vajrayāna, I read the mahāsiddhas, like Virupa, Indrabhuti, etc. I am perfectly comfortable adapting my perspective based on what is useful in that moment.

While there are certainly texts in the Tenjur that define "yoga" in line with the idea of joining two things together, such as uniting method and wisdom, we also find definitions such as the one is a commentary on the Fifty Verses of Guru Devotion, "Yoga is a samadhi that transcends the world." Likewise, in the Yoga Sutras, we find the line, "Yoga is the cessation of transformations of the mind." Of course the philosophical base of the two traditions is not the same: the former being rooted in Madhyamaka, the latter in Saṃkhya, but the definitions are more or less the same.

Given that there is no way to derive joining two things from "rnal 'byor" at all, one assumes that the idea of the Indian panditas of eighth century who assisted Tibetan translators was more oriented towards the resting in the natural state idea.

Yoga implies to link or yoke oneself to something, practice, a deity, etc. Yoga only means "poses" to Westerners because of the popularization of Yoga as exercise. Physical poses and exercises exist in Vajrayana, but generally "Yoga" here has a much broader meaning.

Malcolm wrote:
That depends on how it is etymologized. For example, Srivasta Ramaswami, my guru of yoga, explains  this word is often mistranslated by yoga scholars. We commonly hear that yoga means 'to yoke', from the Sanskrit word 'yuj'. But it is actually a derivative of the word 'yuja' which means 'peace of mind', or 'samadhi', which is the 8th limb of yoga.

Likewise, Tibetan, the early translators translated the term yoga as rnal 'byor. Rnal is from "rnal ma," which means perfect, true, and actual, and here, fundamental.

"byor here means to settle. So in this context, yoga means "to settle into one's authentic fundamental condition."

Indian history is a dense fog. They were shitty record keepers. It's mostly guesswork. And the thing about Sanskrit is there are huge lists of cognate terms. Try looking up words in a Sanskrit dictionary. So many words mean multiple things and many words have the same meaning. The idea of one original root is BS, just like we cannot know who's got the purest vajra lineage. I have to concede that. Note on that however, there is a way to know how Indians practiced tantra. Besides what stuff means is not very important, everyone know yoga is for peace of mind, bija and Asana don't mean anything. They are functional.

Malcolm wrote:
You’ve completely misunderstood the point of my post, but perhaps it is because I did not provide enough context.

Rnal’byor in no way means joining two things together. This is consistent with Ramasvami’s contention, where he is discussing Patanjali’ Yoga Sutras.

In other places he agrees that the word yoga can mean jointing two things together, for example Bhakti yoga, etc. but the term “yoga,” as it was understood by Tibetans, under advisement from their pandita informants, meant “resting in the natural state.”

He will teach students everything from Khorde Ruzhen, Thregchöd, Thögal and Bardo, after you finished a good amount of Ngöndro (min. 10%). And he will give these teachings on a regular basis in closed retreats. If you are interested in Maha- or Anuyoga practices like Tsalung, Thrulkhor, Tummo or other things these are also given. This year he gave teachings on what Padmakara translates as 'Finding Rest in Illusion', which is one famous text of Longchenpa (due to corona it was an online teaching). We also invited Khenchen Pema Sherab, who is the teacher of our resident lama in Europe to give lungs for the 17 Dzogchen tantras and other teachings.

Bob Thurman translated Mahasandhi as Great Connection in his recent teachings with Dr. Nida, reffering to Sandhi as connection, but translates the tibetan term Dzogchen as Great Perfection. Even Keith Dowman, known to invent his own translation like Pixels, Matrix and stuff, uses it in his translation of Longchenpas Chöying Dzö. Maybe it is just me, but I feel that this is quite a well established term for the translation of Dzogchen/Mahasandhi.

It is taught that the mind can only perceive one thing ag a time.
For example, looking at an citrus orange, we are aware that it is both round, and orange-color, and our experience is that we perceive color and shape simultaneously. But it is taught that this is an illusion, that instead, we perceive color and shape alternately, although so rapidly, it appears as occurring simultaneously.

However, there is also the point that buddhism makes, which is that all phenomena are composites. So, regardless of what phenomenal object your mind is perceiving, it is always more than just one thing, because it is always a composite.

How would you reconcile this?

Yoga implies to link or yoke oneself to something, practice, a deity, etc. Yoga only means "poses" to Westerners because of the popularization of Yoga as exercise. Physical poses and exercises exist in Vajrayana, but generally "Yoga" here has a much broader meaning.

Malcolm wrote:
That depends on how it is etymologized. For example, Srivasta Ramaswami, my guru of yoga, explains  this word is often mistranslated by yoga scholars. We commonly hear that yoga means 'to yoke', from the Sanskrit word 'yuj'. But it is actually a derivative of the word 'yuja' which means 'peace of mind', or 'samadhi', which is the 8th limb of yoga.

Likewise, Tibetan, the early translators translated the term yoga as rnal 'byor. Rnal is from "rnal ma," which means perfect, true, and actual, and here, fundamental.

"byor here means to settle. So in this context, yoga means "to settle into one's authentic fundamental condition."

Tantra includes a lot about castes, stuff on deities represents the four castes, etc. But keep in mind there was a proto culture shared with Iran which is very old. Zoarastrian temple fires must have ash from the hearths of four classes workers as well. The notion was diffused. The Brahmins just formalized the hell out of it. Buddha spoke about castes in sutras, obviously he knew about them, he referred to himself in terms of consistent with his status. The fact that his father was elected doesn't mean anyone could get elected. Only chiefs got elected, and his father was elected the big chief by chiefs. So it's the same thing as a Kshatriya. There were other later tribes that got assimilated into Kshatrya like Jats, based on their warlike ways. Jats are recent and some older Kshatrya look at them as like worker class. So this sort of talk is as old as India.

Malcolm wrote:
You should check out Bronkhorst's historical work.

The original system among Indo-Europeans was based on three main classes: priests, warriors, and farmers. The four class system was a later development, unique to India. Also, there was great fluidity between these three classes, meaning one could be all three. The main point is that Buddha's folks interred their important people in Kurgans. The Brahmins thought this was barbaric, and in early texts, referred to the people who lived in Magadha as demons, not even human.

The Scythians, unlike their Iranian cousins, did not do homa offerings. Also, the warrior class was considered the foremost class, with priests and farmers, second and third. We see this in the Buddha's teachings in the Pali canon as well. After the Sakas invaded India in 145 BCE, after they gained power in Gandhara, they strongly supported Buddhism, and continued to enjoy power even after they were made vassals of the Kushana Empire. But there were likely Scythians in the army of Ashoka's father, Chandragupta Maurya. One presumes they were well-acquainted with the ill-fated Śākya tribe that was decimated by Kosalians during the Buddha's lifetime.

Scholars such as Beckwith and Witzel make very convincing arguments that the Śākyas in Magadha are in fact Indo-Scythians from an earlier migration.

Highland Scots, incidentally, claim to be descendants of the Scythians.

Yes, indeed he did. However, we can see in later literature a sort of brahminization of Buddhism, to the point where even creatures like nāgas are divided into four varnas, and so on, and brahmins being part of the deal in terms of royal rites in Thailand, and so on. So we tend to think of the Buddha as being a kṣatriya, when it fact it is unlikely that Buddha was part of the varna system at all, and thus such appellations are irrelevant to his actual social status. In other words, legend has it that Buddha left his royal heritage behind him. But as the chiefs of the Śākyas were elected, it is unlikely he had the obligation of being a royal heir, hence not a prince. In other words, later legends about the person of the Buddha are to him as Arthurian romances are to the original Arthur.

Keep in mind, just as when we refer to “Prince” Siddhartha, saying he was a warrior is merely using a label, and we fill in what that label refers to with our imagination. Being a member of a certain caste in India would both define and limit you to some extent, even back then, but could also mean practically anything within those limits. Obviously not every person born into warrior caste is going to march around with a sword all the time …or even ever hold one.

Malcolm wrote:
It is quite questionable whether the Buddha's tribe was actually part of the caste system. For example, his father, "the king," was an elected chief, and there was no hereditary kingship in the Buddha's tribe. So his being a "prince" is a western affectation that does not even begin to address his actual position in the Śākya tribe. The brahmins were simply not that present in Greater Maghada, and there is evidence that the brahamins to the west seriously looked down upon these primitives who buried their chiefs in burial mounds. While it is certainly improbably that kings of Tibet descended from Mountain Licchavis, what is true is that Tibetans adopted Iranian-Scythian custom of interring their btsan pos, chiefs, in burial mounds as well.

This was the strongest period of growth and the largest amelioration of poverty in the history of not just capitalism but the world. China was so cool back then I thought of retiring there. Foreigners were treated really well.

This week the Biden admin tries to get Daniel Hale 9 years in prison for leaking that 90% of drone kills are innocent bystanders. America brags about bombing Somalia and Afghanistan and quietly bombs another dozen countries. Pushes deadly starvation sanctions against Cuba, Venezuela, N Korea, Iran and  Syria. And that is just the highlights of the last 7 days.

Peter C told me something I didn't believe many months ago when I was talking about the poor rural Chinese countryside. My information was only 12 years old. I remembered some extreme rural poverty and thought people living alongside pigs and ducks without proper toileting would cause future pandemics. He said that poverty was basically gone. I thought impossible, no country can develop that fast. So I reached out and checked. Turns out those "ghost cities" are 70% full with poor rural people that needed proper homes. Once I saw through that Western lie I found a bunch more. Try asking some Muslims about the genocide in Xinjiang. Muslims seem to think it never happened. They do think America paid Tajik terrorists to create terror networks there though. I think it's time Americans  realize they are the most propagandized people on earth right now. An evil global empire of oligarchs with a stranglehold on the entire world. Start minding your own business sickos. You are unwittingly becoming Pentagon employees.

I'm having trouble reconciling that position with the bodhisattva vows, Malcolm.

At the most basic level, we are advised to show compassion to all sentient creatures. In daily life that includes such simple actions as turning aside our foot to avoid crushing an insect on the path, or perhaps picking up the insect and putting it somewhere safe. Also such simple actions as helping a blind person cross the street, so it's not just animals and not (in spite of what some self-proclaimed Buddhists say) just a matter of purely dharmic help.

Looking now at climate change ... it is already driving extreme weather events and bringing daily misery to people all round the world (but especially to the people who have done least to cause it - people in developing nations.) And it is not monolithic, not an all-or-nothing thing like an asteroid impact, and we can still make it less bad than it otherwise would be. Sure, we could have done more, and done it more easily, ten or twenty years ago. But we can still do it now and we will still be able to do it next year. (We will probably still be able to do something in five, ten or even twenty years' time, too, but the time frame makes no difference to the argument.)

On what grounds, then, do you think it is morally or dharmically correct - or even acceptable - to just 'batten down the hatches' and let the rest of the world suffer?

Zhen Li said:
Another analogy, just because Buddhism emphasises generosity, and Jesus also emphasised generosity, does not make Buddhism Christian in any sense. Similarity in one principle which many religions hold in common is really not enough to say that one religion, or the translations of terms is coming from one other religion. Buddhists do prostrations, Muslims do prostrations. Buddhism is not therefore Muslim or influenced by it.

So, if in Jōdo Shinshū faith alone is the cause of birth in the Pure Land (which is what Shinran holds), and if Christianity also suggests that faith alone is the cause of birth or resurrection into heaven (however they phrase it)So, I think it is very inaccurate to say Shin texts are "full of Christian protestant terms."

The first definition of grace, in English, is:

Definition of grace (Entry 1 of 2)
1a : unmerited divine assistance given to humans for their regeneration or sanctification

Now, I agree with both you and Zhen Li that "grace" is not an appropriate word to use in Buddhadharma, on the other hand, you can forgive people for seeing what is referred to as the "primal vow" as a form fo grace: "unmerited divine assistance given to humans for their regeneration or sanctification." And I guarantee you, despite your misgivings, many Westerners are inclined to see such concepts in light of "grace," just as many people confuse the Tibetan "byin rlabs (adhiṣṭhāna)", i.e., "conferred or transformed  through power," aka blessings, for something like grace.

7)   We celebrate the calm and lucid mind. While our inclusion of Buddhist contemplative practice acknowledges the value we place on inner silence through meditation, the heart of Shin practice lies in deep hearing which is about integrating heartfelt spirituality with daily living by developing a praxis of mindfulness on Amida’s unconditional grace, honest self-reflection, and the cultivation of compassion for all sentient beings, including ourselves….

14) We believe that true religious transmission only comes from the grace of the Primal Vow and is not conferred to us by any form of genetic connection through a priestly or monastic lineage or ancestor. We do not accept any form of the religious primogeniture system, the practice of hereditary succession of the religious teachers from the oldest male heir. Only by merit or grace alone can such positions be granted.

The chariot can not be found in any of its parts, one of its parts or separate from its parts, therefore, there is no "chariot" at all, apart from an imputation, "chariot," upon an assembly of parts. The part you are missing is functionality. In order for a thing to be accepted as conventionally existent, prior to analysis, it must perform its imputed function successfully. Upon analysis, even if a given thing properly performs its function, it cannot be found in the collection of its parts, even though it still continues to function.

akuppa said:
Hi all,

I am attempting to work though the Sanskrit of Vasubandhu's thirty verses. I only have an intermediate knowledge of Sanskrit - I have worked though a text book and can confortably read (but perhaps not fully grasp) Sutras such as the Diamond but never mastered the various past tense constructions, but can look them up when needed. Verse and especially philosophical verse is another story. One problem I am having which I hope someone can help me with is that dictionaries such as the Monier-Williams do not cover specialised Buddhist vocabulary and I am having to rely on translations to figure out the meaning of some words. So my question is where do such translators get thier meanings from? What are the standard dictionaries used for the study of Sanskrit Mahyana Buddhist texts? Even Edgerton's BHS dictionary doesn't seem to cut it.

I am also hoping to move on to Chinese and perhaps even Tibetan, so if members could point me towards dictionaries that cover that period I would be grateful.

Until the English revived his memory through Pali sources, the Indians completely forgot about Ashoka, who in any case was a sectarian butcher until his brother's head (who was slain by accident) was brought in for the bounty Ashoka had offered on the heads of Jain monks. You can read all about it in the Ashoka-avadana. Ashoka had 18k Jains slain for a cartoon depicting the Buddha prostrating to Mahāvira. Not very cool.

Aemilius said:
I have  wondered what was this cartoon with Mahavira and Buddha like? -At the time of Ashoka there has not been any human-like representations of Buddha, according to the normative academic view.

"Although India had a long sculptural tradition and a mastery of rich iconography, the Buddha was never represented in human form, but only through Buddhist symbolism. This period may have been aniconic.

"Artists were reluctant to depict the Buddha anthropomorphically, and developed sophisticated aniconic symbols to avoid doing so (even in narrative scenes where other human figures would appear). This tendency remained as late as the 2nd century CE in the southern parts of India, in the art of the Amaravati School (see: Mara's assault on the Buddha). It has been argued that earlier anthropomorphic representations of the Buddha may have been made of wood and may have perished since then. However, no related archaeological evidence has been found.

"The earliest works of Buddhist art in India date back to the 1st century BCE. The Mahabodhi Temple at Bodh Gaya became a model for similar structures in Burma and Indonesia. The frescoes at Sigiriya are said to be even older than the Ajanta Caves paintings."

hi everyone. I just bought an volume of nyima Trakpa's terma in both tibetan and Chinese.

I asked dzogchen Rinpoche (the one based in Kham), he told me nyi trak's teachings are quite popular in Dzogchen monastery and Yaching. Yaching gompa even include his works into a new edition of rinchen terzo currently, which, actually go against Jamgon Kongtrul's original plan to exclude him.

i am not really fond of institutionalized tibetan buddhism. as a westerners we are here, lineage holders are there, and we have this huge chunk of institution between us. as i see it, it is much less a matter of our choice than it is of what is available, in terms of teachers.

Despite all the complicated rhetoric, it amounts to a doctrine common to all schools—the mind is inherently pure, and afflictions are merely adventitious.

Tatsuo said:
I also vaguely remember there being a concept of stages with one stage being "verbal identity". How does full enlightenment (anuttara-samyak-sambodhi) look like in Tendai thought?

Seishin said:
Going back to your original question, what you mention here are the Six Identities (六卽 Rokusoku). To use Paul Swanson's translation;
1) Identity in principle/reality 理卽 (risoku), that all things are inherently endowed with the Buddha-nature and the principle of reality as the threefold truth; One single thought-moment is identical with the principle of the tathāgata-garbha.
2) Verbal identity 名字卽 (myōji-soku), to hear the words concerning the dharma and reach an intellectual understanding;
3) Identity in contemplative practice 觀行卽 (kangyō-soku), to meditate on and practice reality as threefold truth;
4) Identity in outer appearance 相似卽 (or resemblance; sōji-soku), to become related, or have a semblance to, true enlightenment, to sever all obstacles of mistaken views and thoughts of this triple world;
5) Identity in partial realization 分證卽 (bunshō-soku), to have complete insight into the threefold truth and awake from all ignorance;
6) Ultimate identity 究竟卽 (kukyō-soku), ultimate enlightenment

These are essentially the 42 Bodhisattva stages (minus the 10 faiths)

Zhiyi's own explanation of these can be summed up as (again using Paul Swanson's translation);
1) a poor person has a house with a store of [buried] treasure, but does not know about it.
2) A friend points this out, and they come to know about it.
3) They clear away the weeds and dig,
4) until gradually they come near to getting [the treasure].
5) They approach and open the treasure, and
6) they exhaustively take it out and use it.

Here, you can see howthe Store of Treasure can be understood as Hongaku.

Just the teacher I could find. Luckily he was authentic Drikung Kagyu. For over 10 years I went to everything I could. I chose to go to teachings. I didn't choose what was taught or who taught it. That was chosen for me. Eventually I learned what composes a complete teaching, a complete lineage and accomplishment. I understood which teaching I had which was complete and focused on that.  Then I was able to take stock in pith instructions like Gongchig or Dzogchen Upadeshas and understand the when, where, what and why it is useful. So I am very adamant it takes a foundation of an elder Buddha tantra for the pith instructions to be useful. The gurus who propound a foundation like this are indeed the best gurus with the siddhis and amazing students. Pith instructions are footnotes. No one understands a book by only reading the footnotes. Worse. Commentaries are footnotes. And pith instructions are endnotes. The tantra is the main text, unless it's a pity instruction tantra, then it's a book of endnotes.

Malcolm wrote:
One may think: “We concede that our decisions are unreliable, but when we follow the decisions of the Buddha, we are infallible.” Then who decided that the Buddha is infallible? If you say, “The great scholars and adepts like Nagarjuna decided that he is infallible,” then who decided that Nagarjuna is infallible? If you say, “The Foremost Lama Tsong khapa decided it,” then who knows that the Foremost Lama is infallible? If you say, “Our kind and peerless lama, the excellent and great so and so decided,” then infallibility, which depends on your excellent lama, is decided by your own mind. In fact, therefore, it is a tiger who vouches for a lion, it is a yak who vouches for a tiger, it is a dog who vouches for a yak, it is a mouse who vouches for a dog, it is an insect who vouches for a mouse. Thus, an insect is made the final voucher for them all. Therefore, when one analyzes in detail the final basis for any decision, apart from coming back to one’s own mind, nothing else whatsoever is perceived.

The idea that someone can authorize someone else to teach Dharma is just institutional politics. The Buddha refused to appoint an heir. People forget that in their quest for external legitimization.

Lineages are not franchises nor are they intellectual property. These things have been treated as franchises in Tibet, but this is corruption.

A lineage is something that one has received, practiced, and then transmits. That's all. Everyone who receives teachings receives a lineage, which they are then responsible for preserving as best they can, through practice and realization.

But historically, the oldest extant Vajrayāna lineages (outside of Shingon and Tendai) came to Tibet in the mid-eighth century, Guhyasamāja, Guhyagarbha, Vajrakīlaya, Śŗī Heruka (aka Yangdak), etc. There may be some Sarma lineages which are contemporaneous with those brought to Tibet, but in reality the historical origins of all Vajrayāna lineages are obscure, with only lore and legend remaning, just like the origin of Mahāyāna Sūtras. That's just a fact.

All termas are based on Kama. It is a requirement of the terma tradition. And also Sarma schools we frequently see older lineages being refreshed by pure visions.

If women are included within male, then sex is irrelevant.

Malcolm wrote:
Yet it is not, in fact. In this  passage “woman” has been redefined to include men, along with women, who are inferior. The whole point is that  “woman” exemplifies “inferior.” There is no way around this, despite your struggle to gloss this.

Zhen Li said:
That is incorrect. Nothing about the nature of women has been denoted as inferior. Rather, the term 呵責 is translated as rebuke, scold, criticise, blame, abuse. This is indicating that females are labelled as inferior. This is entirely about words and conventions. There is no way around this no matter how much talk of an essential nature of inferiority you want to insert into the Buddha's words here—it is just not there. In fact, what you are doing is inserting assumptions you have about attitudes towards women from other texts into the wording here, which is not present. In doing this,  you are distorting the teaching's clear universalistic intent and simply expressing another of your repeated biases and aversions against this sūtra. Just because you do not like the sūtra does not mean you have to ruin it for others who may take it as authoritative.

For the record, it is clear that the people being so denoted as female, in their nature 性, are the same as the people so denoted as males, i.e. able to realise Tathāgatagarbha. This is all about the limited nature of words and discriminatory conventions and is a decent complement to the teaching on the "Garland of Letters" indicating "half-words" but the Buddha teaching with "no-words."

Malcolm wrote:
You are just making it worse, for example here the MPN delivers this sexist trope just before the passage we have been discussing:

།རིགས་ཀྱི་བུ། གཞན་ཡང་རིགས་ཀྱི་བུའམ། རིགས་ཀྱི་བུ་མོས་སྐྱེས་པའི་རང་བཞིན་དུ་འགྱུར་བར་བསྒོམ་པར་བྱའོ༑ ༑ཅིའི་ཕྱིར་ཞེ་ན། བུད་མེད་ཀྱི་རང་བཞིན་ནི། ཆོས་མ་ཡིན་པ་ཐམས་ཅད་ཀྱི་རྒྱུའི་སྒོ་ནས་འབྱུང་ཁུངས་ཡིན་ཏེ། དཔེར་བྱ་ན། སྦྲང་བུའི་གཅིན་གྱིས་ནི། ནམ་ཡང་ས་ཆེན་པོ་བརླན་པར་ཡང་མི་འགྱུར། ངོམས་པར་ཡང་མི་འགྱུར་བ་དེ་བཞིན་དུ་བུད་མེད་ཀྱང་ནམ་ཡང་འདོད་པས་ངོམས་པར་མི་འགྱུར་ཏེ...[Toh. 120, vol. 54, f. 137a]

Sons of good families, and also daughters of good families, should cultivate the nature [rang bzhin, prakṛti] of a male. Why? The nature of women is the source through which all adharma [chos ma yin] is caused.For example, a single bee can never moisten the entire ground, and also can never be satisfied. Likewise, a woman's desire can never be satisfied...[more explication of the example]

The Tibetan translation from Chinese is very little different:

།རིགས་ཀྱི་བུ། གཞན་ཡང་རིགས་ཀྱི་བུ་དང༌། རིགས་ཀྱི་བུ་མོ་ལ་སོགས་པ་གང་ཡང་སྐྱེས་པའི་ལུས་མི་འདོད་པ་མེད་དོ། །དེ་ཅིའི་ཕྱིར་ཞེན། བུད་མེད་ཐམས་ཅད་ནི་སྡིག་པ་ཐམས་ཅད་ཀྱི་གནས་ཡིན་པའི་ཕྱིར་རོ། །རིགས་ཀྱི་བུ། གཞན་ཡང་འདི་ལྟ་སྟེ། དཔེར་ན༑ སྦྲང་བུའི་གཅིན་གྱིས་ནི་ས་ཆེན་པོ་འདི་རླན་པར་མི་ནུས་སོ། །བུད་མེད་ཅེས་བྱ་བའི་འདོད་ཆགས་ཆོག་མི་ཤེས་པའང་དེ་དང་འདྲ་སྟེ...[Toh. 119, vol. 52, f. 152b—153a]

Further, sons and daughters of good families should never not desire the body [lus] of a man. Why? All women are the source of all wickedness [sdig pa]. Son of a good family, further, it as follows: A single bee cannot moisten the entire ground, likewise, a woman is never satisfied by desire...

It is immediately after this example that we get to the passage that we have been discussing:

།རིགས་ཀྱི་བུ། དེ་བས་ན། ཡོངས་སུ་མྱ་ངན་ལས་འདས་པ་ཆེན་པོ་འདི་ཐོས་ནས་བུད་མེད་ཀྱི་རང་བཞིན་ལ་མ་ཆགས་པའི་སེམས་བསྐྱེད་པར་བྱ་སྟེ། སྐྱེས་པའི་རང་བཞིན་དུ་འགྱུར་བར་སེམས་བསྐྱེད་པར་བྱའོ། །ཅིའི་ཕྱིར་ཞེ་ན། མདོ་འདི་ནི། སྐྱེས་པའི་རང་བཞིན་དེ་གཤེགས་པའི་སྙིང་པོ་ཡང་དག་པར་སྟོན་པའི་ཕྱིར་རོ། །སྐྱེས་པའི་རང་བཞིན་ནི། མི་ཞེས་བྱའོ། །དེ་བཞིན་གཤེགས་པའི་རང་བཞིན་ནི། སྐྱེས་པའོ། །འཇིག་རྟེན་ན་སྐྱེས་པ་ཡོད་པ་གང་ཡིན་པ་དེ་དག་ཀྱང་བདག་ཉིད་ལ་དེ་བཞིན་གཤེགས་པའི་སྙིང་པོ་ཡོད་པར་མི་ཤེས་པའི་ཕྱིར་སྐྱེས་པའི་རང་བཞིན་མ་ཡིན་ནོ། །དེ་བཞིན་གཤེགས་པའི་སྙིང་པོ་མི་ཤེས་པ་གང་ཡིན་པ་དེ་དག་ནི། བུད་མེད་ཡིན་ནོ། །ཞེས་ང་ཟེར་རོ། །དེ་བཞིན་གཤེགས་པའི་སྙིང་པོ་བདག་ལ་ཡོད་དོ་སྙམ་དུ་ཡང་དག་པར་ཤེས་པ་གང་ཡིན་པ་དེ་དག་ནི། སྐྱེས་པའི་མཆོག་ཏུ་གཏོགས་ཏེ། བུད་མེད་ཡིན་དུ་ཟིན་ཀྱང་སྐྱེས་པའི་མཆོག་ཏུ་གཏོགས་སོ། །དེ་ལྟར་ན། ཡོངས་སུ་མྱ་ངན་ལས་འདས་པ་ཆེན་པོའི་མདོ་ཆེན་པོ་འདི་ནི་དེ་བཞིན་གཤེགས་པའི་སྙིང་པོ་སྟོན་པའི་ཕྱིར་དཔག་ཏུ་མེད་པ་ཡིན་ནོ། [Toh. 120, vol. 54, f. 137b]

Son of a good family, therefore, having heard this Mahāparinirvāṇa, one should generate the thought to never be attached to the nature of a woman. One should generate the thought to become the nature of a man. Why? Because this sūtra correctly explicates the male nature to be tathāgatagarbha [de bzhin gshegs pa'i snying po]. The male nature is called "man." The nature of the tathāgatagarbha is male. Where ever there are men in the world who do not know that the tathāgatagarbha exists in themselves, they lack the male nature. I call those who do not know tathāgatagarbha "women." Those who correctly know and think "Tathāgatagarbha exists in me," are the supreme among men, even such women who grasp this are included in the supreme among men. In this case, this great Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra is inestimable because it explicates tathāgatagarbha.

It is virtually impossible to sustain an argument that this passage is not predicated upon sexist attitudes towards women. Indeed, the composer of the sūtra sets up the entire passage by describing women as insatiable, and the source of all Adharma. It is not like passages written for bhikṣus that describe the perils of the female form, which are to be reversed by bhikṣunīs. It is clearly stating FEMALE BODIES are inherently WICKED as opposed to MALE BODIES that are inherently VIRTUOUS. You just don't get much more sexist than that.

And there is the passage in the beginning where the upāsikās mentally denigrate their female bodies as wicked (བུད་མེད་ཀྱི་ལུས་ངན་ནོ་སྙམ་དུ་སྨོད་པ་ [Toh. 120 vol. 54, f. 7b]). Then there is the stock passage which declares a tathāgata only takes a male body, but displays both male and female bodies to tame sentient beings (དེ་བཞིན་གཤེགས་པ་ནི་རྟག་ཏུ་སྐྱེས་པ་ཁོ་ན་ཡིན་བཞིན་དུ་སེམས་ཅན་རྣམས་གདུལ་བའི་ཕྱིར་གཉི་གར་ཡང་སྟོན་ཏོ [Toh. 120, vol 54, f. 63b]), etc.

Now, of course I understand why you wish to maintain some sort of interpretive scheme to save the words of the text from clearly saying what they say. There is the passage where the Buddha explains his use of exaggeration with the word "all" with the following verse:

[1]All rivers wind through valleys,
all women are deceitful,
all groves are wooded,
and all lords are happy. [/i]

Naturally, Mañjuśṛī stands up and objects to this, and explains in short:

Not all rivers are winding,
not all women are deceitful,
not all groves are wooded, 
and not all lords are happy.

After Mañjuśṛī's explanation, the Buddha responds with the analogy of medicine. Then there is the gender transformation of Kotaka's daughter, and the sūtra concludes shortly thereafter, at least in the Tibetan recension.

And of course, the only gender that is subject to any negative tropes in this sūtra on the basis of gender are women. So, sexist. We really should poll women on this passage, to see how they feel about. I am pretty sure of the outcome.

Where the original Sanskrit text is available, that would seem like the ideal source, though in many cases only Tibetan or Chinese translations of many texts are available.

Malcolm wrote:
Chinese translations often show stages of accretion in a given sūtra, where as Tibetan translations tend to show sūtra texts in their mature forms as they existed in Northern India, since sūtra translation in China started in the second century CE and only in the 8th century CE in Tibet.

Because the Sanskrit of these texts is often hard to parse, having the Chinese and Tibetan are invaluable aids for translators, since they form a kind of commentary. We are still 100 years away from having the best translations we can muster. So we do our best.

Since the Buddha would never do do this, we must accept such passages which criticize women on the basis of their gender to be errors of transcription.

A "transcription" error is a mistake in transferring an utterance or another text. There are transcription errors in the sūtra as we have it. But here the premises and conclusion, as well as broader context, are clear. You are just ignoring them.

Malcolm wrote:
My point, as you know, is that these texts are not necessarily accurate representations of "What the Buddha said." Since this is not well-spoken, it should not be considered valid. Its a classic example of sexist writing, and no modern, well-educated women will find the passage acceptable.

No, I am pointing out the very premise is unacceptable. If the premise is unacceptable, the conclusion cannot be acceptable. On its face, the passage clearly ranks women as inferior to men.

Zhen Li said:
Anyway, I appreciate a strong sense of justice and I don't think it is necessarily a bad thing, just be careful of letting it cause you to miss the forest for the trees. The point should be very clear from the text that for all practical purposes one's sex is irrelevant to Buddha nature.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course. However, that point is made more effectively in other sūtras than this one. It is not a central or crucial passage in main body of the sūtra's argument but it is sterling example of sexism in sūtra composition. We can, of course, attempt to forensically understand why this particular statement was made, but all we will really come up with, as we both agree, is that the passage was written at a time when women were more disenfranchised than they are now, at least in most modern countries. The significance of the passage is that it shows how disenfranchised women were when the Mahāyāna sūtras were composed. This is how we should understand passages in sutras where women are encouraged to aspire to be born as men; where buddhafields are described as desirable because beings there only have penises; other episodes where women undergo gender transformation merely upon hearing a sūtra, such as in the Māyopamasamādhi Sūtra, and so on.

Anyway, we've beat this dead horse into dog meat...

I agree with your statement. I differ in regard to how we can use and view sūtras as practitioners. Even an utterance from the mouth of Śākyamuni Buddha is not going to be a perfect representation of the Dharma. As the Tathāgataguhya puts it, from the time of his awakening under the Bodhi Tree to his entrance into Parinirvāṇa, the Buddha never uttered a single word. If a Dharma gate is not suited to us, our job as practitioners is not then to assume ill intent—which may or may not have been present. There are so many possibilities that are beyond our ability to fathom that it is better to withhold judgement and refocus on what is important in our individual practice. In our capacity as scholars we can certainly use critical techniques to analyse texts—I do this as well, but this is not part of my approach to texts as practitioners.

Casual racism may not be ill-intentioned, but it’s still racism. No one can ever say it is skillful. Likewise, the casual sexism that we sometimes find in sutras and tantras, reflective of another era, is certainly not intended to harm, but it is a product of harm to sentient beings—women—in any case. There is a passage in the Sandhivyakarana Tantra that runs something like“The single delightful vajra word is heard variously by different people according to differences in capacities,” meaning that everything written down about what the Buddha said is limited by how this single vajra word was received. The consequence of this hermeneutic strategy is that anything written down about what the Buddha said can be subject to critical evaluation, and anything found wanting is not a fault to be addressed to the Buddha, but rather to those who attempted to write down what they thought he said.

Yes, it is about writing, since that is the only medium by which we may explore what the Buddha is purported to have said, and writing is an intentional act that is processed through a limited mind.

And texts are relative, imperfect, edited, translated, subject to revision and emendation. They do not spring forth full formed, like Athena from the forehead of Zeus.

The Buddha continues to manifest in many forms, and he continues to teach us in many ways other than through the words of sūtras.

Sometimes people allowed and continue to allow their biases to slip into their representations of what they understood the Buddha to teach.

Zhen Li said:
This is the point—look for the definitive meaning and don't get caught up in the particulars. The point is that all beings equally have Buddha-nature. The discriminated form of male or female does not apply on the ultimate level. At the end of the day, attributing fault is not our job as practitioners and is liable to make us incur karmic harm.

Malcolm wrote:
I don't agree that subjecting sūtras and tantras to critical evaluation involves any karmic risk at all. Quite the contrary. When we find faults in texts that represent what the Buddha said, we should note those. I don't think we can naively assume that a text that makes it into a "canon" is necessarily Buddhavacana. It is only a matter of politeness that prevents and prevented people in the past from offering criticisms.

Zhen Li said:
but we cannot know intentions or fault without the divine eye.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, and that eye is sorely lacking these days. Therefore, we must rely on our own critical acumen to determine what to accept and what to reject, and not fetishize texts, which in any case are only representations of what someone thought the Buddha has said, and not necessarily what the Buddha may have actually said.

Zhen Li said:
In regards to sūtras or individual passages, this is also the case—we can pass over it if it does not apply to us, but we should be careful of saying "this is the fault of a lazy or sexist monk" unless we know for sure with the divine eye.

Malcolm wrote:
I clearly disagree. We can certainly know that not all sūtras are of the same literary quality, nor profundity, and when they detail certain ideas that are clearly discriminatory or perpetuate discrimination, we can reject those tropes as unfortunate examples of bias. Any other approach is simple casuistry. Let me give you another example—— the prohibition against ordaining albinos. Simple bias and nothing more.

You are reading the premises and ignoring the conclusion. You are seeing the vyañjana but not the artha. The context is a patriarchal culture. To make the same point today one uses different words to suit the different context, but the conclusion is the same.

I agree with your last point, but to treat these passages as simply ill-intentioned without seeing the point behind them is a bit reckless. The sūtras do not set out to hurt feelings like schoolyard bullies. If that's how we perceive it then we have to re-evaluate our perception, seeing the reasons behind skilful means, and always keeping an eye on the definitive meaning intended.

Malcolm wrote:
Casual racism may not be ill-intentioned,  but it’s still racism. No one can ever say it is skillful. Likewise, the casual sexism that we sometimes find in sutras and tantras, reflective of another era, is certainly not intended to harm, but it is a product of harm to sentient beings—women—in any case. There is a passage in the Sandhivyakarana Tantra that runs something like“The single delightful vajra word is heard variously by different people according to differences in capacities,” meaning that everything written down about what the Buddha said is limited by how this single vajra word was received. The consequence of this hermeneutic strategy is that anything written down about what the Buddha said can be subject to critical evaluation, and anything found wanting is not a fault to be addressed to the Buddha, but rather to those who attempted to write down what they thought he said.

According to this scripture, a monk wished to practice the Dharma in the eastern world of delight and made a vow not to harbor anger or malice towards any being until he achieved enlightenment. He duly proved "immovable" and when he succeeded, he became the buddha Akshobhya.

Some buddhist schools  regard the Tushita heaven where Bodhisattva Maitreya presently resides a pureland.

The Red Book says Indrabhuti got The Book which was a root Vajrayana text, most likely Guhyagarbha, Guhyasamaja,  from Shakyamuni and taught it to Kukaraja who understood it and then taught what he understood to Indrabhuti. They both spent their lives Practicing.

In terms of... scriptural authority, I suppose, is it appropriate to consider that within each dispensation there will be Vajrayana, but it's just a matter of whether or not the initial supreme nirmanakaya teaches it specifically themselves? That is, Shakyamuni is one of the relatively few who taught Vajrayana, but Maitreya will not. Even in the dispensation of Maitreya, however, will there still be Vajrayana that is simply passed down via a different 'chain' so to speak?

I hope that's clear enough.

Content:
Zhen Li said:
The best way to get an idea of whether there's bias involved is to study the primary languages ourselves and translate directly.

But to answer your questions, there are hundreds of people translating Buddhist texts, and hundreds of translations. It is easier to focus on a single example. I have a lot of experience now with Pali, Sanskrit, and Chinese, and a few other languages, so may be able to help with some generalisations in response to your questions.
Lotomístico said:
How much bias based on the cultural background of the author is involved? 19th century orientalist scholars perhaps trying to impose their own understanding of what Buddhism is...some even using Christian terminology (one specifically I can think of)

Zhen Li said:
If someone is directly inserting ideas not found in the source text, or excluding materials, that's going to be seen pretty quickly. Maybe you had in mind someone like I.B. Horner, who chose not to translate passages dealing with monastic sexual misconduct because it appeared offensive. A modern equivalent might be pronoun choice. The Buddha often refers to the assembly as "kulaputrāḥ" sons of good family and the masculine pronoun is standard, but some may prefer to make it inclusive (by the way, many sūtras are gender inclusive and mention "daughters" of good family and use the feminine pronoun). It is probably standard to translate deva as god, but obviously, this could be confused with Abrahamic ideas of monotheistic gods if someone isn't familiar with Buddhism. I think, in general, a lot of the potential confusion is coming on the side of the reader—if you have read a large quantity of sūtras, you will begin to identify what terms the translator is using for what ideas. Others might be a bit harder to parse, for instance "own-being" and "inherent existence" are both common translations of sva-bhāva. So, at the end of the day, some familiarity with Sanskrit is the best solution.
Lotomístico said:
More recent translations possibly leaning towards a new agey or western rationalist overlay to Buddhism.

Zhen Li said:
Stephen Batchelor's translations of the four noble truths as the "four tasks" are obvious examples where an author's idiosyncratic philosophy can distort what the source text is saying.
Lotomístico said:
Do modern translations usually consult existing texts? Are the translators scholars in Sanskrit or classical Chinese? Or do many resort to paraphrase of existing translations?

Zhen Li said:
People tend to use the same terms that have become common place because English-speaking Buddhist audiences are familiar with them. The first lines of sutras are an example: Evaṃ mayā śrūtaṃ  is literally "Thus it was heard by me," but the convention is to translate it as "Thus have I heard" removing the instrumental meaning in mayā. The full line Evaṃ mayā śrūtaṃ ekasmin samaye could be read "It was heard by me at one time" but there has been a convention, which may come from manuscripts inserting punctuation markers between śrūtaṃ and ekasmin, of reading it as "It was heard by me. At one time ..." In fact, it is not possible to know the originally intended form of this line, but convention in India eventually went with splitting it. The conventional full translation in English, which most translations go with, is "Thus have I heard. At one time ..."

In fact, the Sanskrit texts are biased inherently. The middle-Indic originals of many terms, such as sutta, are ambiguous. Sutta can be read in Sanskrit as sūkta, well spoken, or as sūtra, thread/discourse. There are good arguments that it should be read as sūkta; sūtra has lots of other uses, such as to indicate sections in grammatical texts, and doesn't necessarily have any reason to be read as sūtra. However, Pāli commentaries accept that sutta can be read as both sūkta and sūtra. That Sanskrit sticks with sūtra, and many other such translation choices, makes it inherently biased in much the same way that our English translations are biased if we are concerned with particular word choice. Even bodhisattva, from bodhisatta, is a choice between a variety of options, such as bodhiśakta. Anyway, the Sanskrit tradition decided that it is bodhisattva, and thus it has been so for two thousand years.

So, issues to keep in mind are really exclusion, interpolation, source manuscript/edition choice, and word choice.

But if you read enough, you will begin to get an idea for what the intended meaning of the Mahāyāna sūtras is. In fact, these distinctions are unlikely to make a huge impact unless one is focusing one's practice only on one translation. Read the sūtras widely and continue reading, it will pay off.

Malcolm wrote:
And of course, there is the fact that bodhisatva, hero of awakening, was “corrected” to by bodhisattva by 19th century philologists, leading to a total misunderstanding of this term.

Today, as far as I can judge, Holocaust revisionism has reached its main objective in demonstrating that there is no valid internal or external piece of evidence for claiming that Hitler by means of gas chambers in Auschwitz-Birkenau or elsewhere, murdered millions of Jews in cold blood. From whatever angle you look at it this claim is so absurd that it in itself becomes a most interesting problem how it can be that so many people for so long have believed in what we now safely can call the Holocaust myth. The Hitlerian gas chambers, like the alleged weapons of mass destruction of Irak´s former dictator, have now been assigned to the realm of myth. Or, if you wish, they are mere rumors, as Dr. Faurisson phrased it in a famous note in 1979. And without a weapon of mass murder, it follows that there can be no mass murder. Thus the Holocaust, in the sense of mass murder of Jews by means of gas chambers is, if you believe in logic, a mere myth.

Occasionally, however, some masters like Longchenpa, Tsongkhapa, or Khyentse Wangpo do let slip what realization they have attained in order to inspire disciples.

Arnoud said:
Is that why a lot of lamas now say the signs are more compassion, less grasping and more devotion?
It seems a little contradictory as well when the signs are seeing this and that but then people get told what they experience is just a nyam and need to just keep practicing. I guess ultimately they are all nyams until Buddhahood.

Malcolm wrote:
There are signs of the mundane stages of the path, and signs of the transcendent stages of the path. For example, having dreams of purification when doing Vajrasattva are not transcendent signs. The latter only manifest when one has attained the first bodhisattva stage. The main teaching of every tradition has a detailed explanation of these in their Varjayāna paths and stages literature.

PadmaVonSamba said:
I began to do the traditional ngongdro many years ago. Just about everybody in our dharma group was doing it. I was never instructed to begin doing it.so, When I told my teacher (a khenpo) his response was basically “meh” or sort of, “ok whatever.”
After 11,000 prostrations I realized that I just wasn’t there with it. Just going through the motions, pretending, getting a nice bump that looked like a third eye on my forehead. Totally feeding my ‘monkey mind’ if you want to get right down to it. I didn’t continue after that.
But there are two things I want to mention, both from very qualified teachers.
I asked one whether ngondro was ‘right’ for everybody. His answer was than none of the Buddhist teachings are wrong for anybody. But not everybody is suited to every type of practice. The tradition I follow is vajrayana but I know I will really never fit the definition of a vajrayana practioner. Maybe I am what you’d call sutrayana with some vajrayana practices thrown in.
The other thing that a teacher said was that “ngondro” can be all types of activity. Not just the four 100,000s that have become the standard. One year I lived and worked at a retreat center in the kitchen. Cooking every day, I was told, is also ngondro. So, my understanding is that the “essential thing” (if I can say that) isn’t the means as much as the ends. It is what you get out of it, the clearing away of obstacles, the “purification” (I hate that word) of one’s practice. Whether it’s dumping rice and jewels on a metal plate or sweeping the shrine room floor, the point is transformation.


TharpaChodron said:
On a side note and derailing the thread, I read a comment recently online from a longtime practitioner who was saying that many of his fellow practitioners were having serious financial and health issues and were in a bad situation, given they had devoted their lives to practice and not financial security.

I imagine they did Ngondro and followed their teachers guidance, not that those things are connected at all to material well-being.

Regarding your second question, typically you'd do a round of guru yoga first before doing other sadhanas, but nothing prevents you to take the dakini as the guru. Simhamukha was a practice extensively used by Guru Rinpoche, so you could even have him appear in this form and do a corresponding guru yoga, followed by the actual practice. Or you take one if his other wrathful forms like Guru Drakpur as the guru yoga followed by Simhamukha practice, followed by the actual sadhana practice.

Sure, signs such as seeing one hundred buddhas, visiting one hundred buddhafields, and so on, which are a sign of attaining the first bhumi, are straight forward and objective.

Or alternately, signs such as the intense pain of pranayama practices and so on, which result when ordinary people practice completion stage practices related the nadis, vayus, and bindus, are also straight forward and objective, as are signs like smoke, fireflies, and so on, which are signs of the vayus entering the central channel. These are all "realizations."

The point is that people like to say "So and so is realized" without knowing anything about the person, other than just passing along rumors they have heard about this teacher and that. I can't tell you the number of ads I have seen for this and that teacher "praising them as highly realized" without specifying what that realization is. Calling teachers "realized" is just advertising puffery.

My guru, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, used to reject the idea that he was a rtogs ldan, a person possessing realization, and basically said that if any of his students wanted to prove they were realized they should be able to hold their hand in fire without it becoming damaged in anyway.

yes, it does.

you made a post quoting me at the beginning, but i m not sure what is your question?

my questions were adressed to Malcolm,since he commented on my words about "not my thing", so i would like to hear some elaboration.

my point of view is that even though tibetan buddhism provide quite an array of different approaches to suit out proclivities, those approaches do not suppose to please or entertain our monkey mind. otherwise there is a danger that we reduce our practice to something merely along the lines of other toys of our monkey mind, be it our hobbies, or any other activities we use to entertain ourselves or "kill time". that especially the case for ngöndro, since we have almost no teachers who can say that ngöndro is not necessary.

Malcolm wrote:
If you don't enjoy your practice, there is no point in doing it.

The approach to so-called preliminary practices varies quite a bit from lineage to lineage. For instance, in the Sakya school, people are introduced to the practice of a major yidam, such as Hevajra, immediately, and rather than focusing accumulating ngondro, spend time learning the sadhana and focusing on maintaining the daily commitment. Generally, ngondro is something in the Sakya school which one does when one goes into a retreat. The Sakyapas did not even have a text on Ngondro specifically until the 1940's, written by a Nalendra khenpo who was inspired by Words of My Precious Teacher (full disclosure, I have translated this text and it is sitting at Wisdom, waiting to be edited). Even here, the explanation is combined with four sadhanas, and there was no separate text for Ngondro until Dezhung Rinpoche wrote one in the 1970's.

The Gelukpas also have a different approach, their "ngondro" is Lamrim in its entirety, even though they have a special set of nine 100,000 practices, but they are not prerequisites for anything. They can be done anytime one has time.

The structured ngondro program is more characteristic of Nyingma and Karma Kagyu. Drigung is very heavy on ngondro accumulations, especially in how they present the Yangzab teachings, requiring, in the older manuals, 400,000 of each. Modern teachers like Ontul Rinpoche and the late Gyalpo Rinpoche, however, relaxed such requirements.

As for "not my thing," lets say you received a Vajravārāhī initiation, but you prefer Vajrabhairava, which you have also received, there is no fault.

In general, non-Tibetans develop this uptight attitude about "doing things right." Instead of developing a broad, open, relaxed attitude, they become puritanical, insisting on some sort of orthopraxy, becoming overly self-critical, as well as critical of others, whom they feel are "not doing things right."

In reality, Ngondro is a main practice. Why? It is just three different ways of relating the guru. Properly speaking, Mandala offerings are in fact part of guru yoga. If one understands the meaning of the dissolution of the refuge tree, one can even attain complete awakening merely doing refuge. Or, if one has sufficient devotion, as Virupa says, one can attain mahamudra realization merely by serving one's guru without meditating even for a single second.

Now I’m trying to find a new cushion (preferably ordering one online if possible), one that is more Tibetan and traditional (a higher seat and filled with buckwheat?).

However, I’m really struggling to find a place to buy it from. Ideally I would want to buy it from a dharma organization so that I can also support it, rather than finding something on Amazon.

Any tips on where I might find one?


Malcolm wrote:
Hate to say it, but there is no such thing as a Tibetan meditation cushion. You might be thinking of a so-called gomden, which Chogyam Trungpa had invented for Westerners. Otheerwise, the cushions we use in nearly all western Dharma centers are variations on Japanese floor mats and pillows via the Zen tradition.

The word realization, rtogs pa, is used very loosely, to describe all kinds of things. In Tibetan, it runs the gamut from merely understanding something, all the way up to realizing buddhahood. So when we hear that "X is realized", everyone thinks they know what this means, but actually, without some qualification, it is kind of a meaningless statement. Realized what? The path of accumulation, application, seeing? The creation stage? The completion stage? Emptiness? etc.

My thesis is that Tibetans never bothered to understand our negative attitudes towards Christianity specifically, and religions generally.

Malcolm wrote:
Umm no. Tibetans themselves had a negative attitude towards Christianity, beginning with the expulsion of Nestorians from Tibet in the mid-8th century on up, the establishment of a Catholic church and in Ladakh, which was established in 1625 and shut down in 1640, with all the missionaries and converts exiled. The Capuchins were expelled in 1760.  Catholic churches were burned, Catholics were executed, and four French missionaries were tortured and executed in Batang, Khams during the Batang uprising of 1905 ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batang_uprising ).

Tibetans have a very negative attitude towards Islam and Muslims in general. Tibetan Buddhists generally have very negative attitude towards Bonpos, and the legends of Indian Mahasiddhas are filled with negative portrayals of Hindus.

I would say that this sūtra was more important to Mādhyamikas.

The Tibetans know this sūtra under its short title, གསང་བ་བསམ་གྱིས་མི་ཁྱབ་པའི་མདོ, the Sūtra of the Inconceivable Secret. It is regularly cited by scholars in every school.

Malcolm wrote:
Because it is necessary to understand what kinds of experiences one will have on the path, even if one has not reached this or that stage.

The latter part about Vajrayana is fair, but since we're in a Mahayana subforum, I'd like to press you on the first part if you're willing to entertain my fancy. Why is it necessary to understand what kinds of experiences one will have on the path, even fi one has not reached a particular stage? I'm unlikely to argue about it, I'm just curious as my lack of understanding has meant I zone-out to those teachings, which can't be good.

Malcolm wrote:
Vajrayāna is a subdivision of Mahāyāna, not something separate.

It is necessary, because it is a vital part of the our path. If we do not understand these paths and stages, we will not know how to practice them. Zoning out in teachings is not necessarily a bad thing, more often than not it is a sign that we are eliminating traces of ignorance.

We do not want to be like horses with blinders on, only seeing what is directly in front of us on the road. This is not a good way to hear and reflect on teh Dharma. Moreover, by hearing of the experiences of the paths and stages, it can cause us to be inspired about the possibility of our attaining them and cause rejoicing in those who have attained them.

Malcolm wrote:
Knowledge is not a hindrance. Ignorance is.

First, one generates bodhicitta, the desire to liberate all sentient beings from samsara. This has two aspects, ultimate and relative. The relative aspect refers to the aspiration, and then practicing the six perfections. Ultimate bodhicitta means practicing śamatha and vipaśyanā.

One practices these two bodhicitta together, until one realizes emptiness. This is the first bodhisattva bhumi. One continues to practice, until the practice of vipaśyanā has eradicated all traces of affliction (desire, hatred, and ignorance). This happens conventionally, at the seventh bhumi. Ultimately, has eradicated all traces of grasping to personal and phenomena identity, and one attains the omniscience of buddhahood, this happens when one transitions from being a tenth stage bodhisattva to buddhahood. A buddha is a totally realized person. There is no other kind of totally or fully realized person.

Study of Bodhicittavivarana by Christian Lindtner

He is mistaken. It is a commentary on the Akṣobhyavajra bodhicitta section of the Guhyasamāja.

The Ratnapradipa cannot be by Bhavavivka since it quotes Candrakirti's commentary on the Sixty directly:

In fact, this text mentions Candrakīrti twelve times.

How Lindtner could have missed this is a mystery, but he is not a very reliable scholar.

Not only this, but the authors he mentions do not cite the Bodhicittavivarana at all, I checked.

Yes, and this is acknowledged in traditional Indian commentaries; that is, the that term "dukha" itself refers to duhka-duhka. The other two dukhas are considered dukha because everything pleasant becomes a source of pain, and everything neutral falls apart.

Kim O'Hara said:
Thanks, Malcolm.
The link, for those still following the discussion, is the PTS dictionary's definition of dukkha. The key points in it, from my POV, are these two paragraphs, and particularly the two sentences I have made bold text: B. (nt.; but pl. also dukkhā, e. g. S i.23; Sn 728; Dh 202, 203, 221. Spelling dukha (after sukha) at Dh 83, 203). There is no word in English covering the same ground as Dukkha does in Pali. Our modern words are too specialised, too limited, and usually too strong. Sukha & dukkha are ease and dis-ease (but we use disease in another sense); or wealth and ilth from well & ill (but we have now lost ilth); or wellbeing and ill-ness (but illness means something else in English). We are forced, therefore, in translation to use half synonyms, no one of which is exact. Dukkha is equally mental & physical. Pain is too predominantly physical, sorrow too exclusively mental, but in some connections they have to be used in default of any more exact rendering. Discomfort, suffering, ill, and trouble can occasionally be used in certain connections. Misery, distress, agony, affliction and woe are never right. They are all much too strong & are only mental (see Mrs. Rh. D. Bud. Psy. 83-86, quoting Ledi Sadaw).
I. Main Points in the Use of the Word. -- The recognition of the fact of Dukkha stands out as essential in early Buddhism. In the very first discourse the four socalled Truths or Facts (see saccāni) deal chiefly with dukkha. The first of the four gives certain universally recognised cases of it, & then sums them up in short. The five groups (of physical & mental qualities which make an individual) are accompanied by ill so far as those groups are fraught with āsavas and grasping. ...
The PTS goes on to give sources for the second paragraph (which I might look at again after such a long gap) and then, as Heather noted, on and on and on, less usefully for most of us.

Suffer means to bear difficulty, pain, anguish, sorrow and so on. Seems like a perfect equivalent to me, apart form the samskara dukkha, which is not properly a kind of pain, but the general impermanence of formations. YMMV.

Actually, I was wrong, the Lanka is mentioned in the Sūtrasammucaya, but even here, there is some difficulty, since the Lanka's gatha section predicts Nāgārjuna, and thereby portions of the Lanka definitely date later than Nāgārjuna himself. One would can run the Tibetan or Sanskrit texts of the Lanka through the Buddhanexus program, and find out specifically which verses in Nāgārjuna's works match, and then see whether which phrases are in which part of the Lanka, and whether they date from before or after Nāgārjuna. The Lanka was not compiled in a day, but like other Mahāyāna sūtras shows considerable evidence of multiple layers of composition.

What is the mentality in Tibetan Buddhism about taking these precepts in relation to taking your own initiative? Do you always have to wait for your Lama to take initiative to give the precepts and till then one does not follow them and continue killing, stealing etc till the Lama tells otherwise. From the practitioner's point of view in Tibetan Buddhism do followers take a passive stance and not take his own initiative to take up the 5 Precepts?

Malcolm wrote:
People can, under their own initiative, follow which ever of the pratimokṣa vows they feel they can keep. Please refer to the fourth chapter of the Abhidharmakośabhaṣyaṃ.

Dharmasherab said:
Is there a reason you referred to these as 'vows' and not 'precepts'? Why did you use the word 'Pratimoksa' to refer to the 5 Precepts?

Malcolm wrote:
The term in Sanskrit is "saṃvara," in Tibetan "sdom." These two terms mean "restraint." Pratimokṣa means "personal liberation." Pratimokṣa samvara therefore means "the restraints one adopts for personal liberation."

Definition of precept
1 : a command or principle intended especially as a general rule of action
2 : an order issued by legally constituted authority to a subordinate official

Definition of vow (noun)
: a solemn promise or assertion
specifically : one by which a person is bound to an act, service, or condition

THE LANKAVATARASUTRA
IN EARLY INDIAN MADHYAMAKA LITERATURE
Christian Lindtner, Copenhagen, Asiatiche Studien, XLV, 1 (1992), pp.244-279

Article of Lindtner where he shows how Nagarjuna, Aryadeva and others are actually quoting from Lankavatara sutra.

some excerpts:

Close or literal allusions, or even explicit references mentioning the
source, i.e. the LS, are to be found in the following early Madhyamaka
texts: Madhyamakakarika (MK), Vigrahavyavartanii(W), Yuktisastika (YS),
Catuhstava (CS) III (= Acintyastava), Sutrasamuccaya (SS),
Bodhicittavivarana (BV), Mahayanavimsika, Bhavasamkranti and
Bhavanakrama — all ascribed to Nagarjuna.6
In case of Aryadeva we have
the Catuhsataka (CS) and two minor treatises (Taisho 1639 and Taisho
1640) to which I shall revert later.7

MK XXIV.7 runs:
atra brumah iunyatdydm na tvam vetsi prayojanam /
iiinyatdm Sunyatdrtham ca tata evam vihanyase //

Again, as above, an opponent has just (verses 1-6) claimed that
Nagarjuna's doctrine of sunyata is problematic. Again we see Nagarjuna
introducing his reply by calling upon the authority of a sutra, in this case
LS 11.145:
sarvabhavo 'svabhavo hi sadvacanam tathapy asat /
iunyatd<m> iunyatartham vabalo pafyan vidhavati//

In a somewhat archaic fashion the sutra launches a general statement
about "a fool" which Nagarjuna specifies by making it refer to a second
person (se) in a particular situation (evam), namely his opponent. LS, like
MK, mentions, but does not explain the two concepts sunyata and sunyatartha, Nagarjuna, however, does explain the terms in the sequel, exactly
as a sastrakara is expected to do. Apparently he also introduces a third
concept not mentioned in the LS verse: the prayojana of sunyata. But this
is only apparently. The LS says that all things lack svabhava, including this
perfectly true and sound statement itself. As we recall, Nagarjuna exapresses exactly the same idea several times elsewhere, above all in W and
in this very chapter, verse 18. This is the celebrated stanza:
yah prafityasamutpadah Sunyatam torn pracaksmahe /
sd prajnaptir updddya pratipat saiva madhyamd //
This verse, in other words, is an explanation of what Nagarjuna understands by the prayojana of sunyata.

Tenma said:
Would this explain why Yeshe Tsogyal's past incarnations are said to have been the goddesses Ganga and Saraswati? Is the "being" fulfilling the role of Ganga, this sister of Lord Shiva, always changing and likewise Shiva? Would Saraswati be a "position" or a more "solid being" such as Avalokiteshvara, Tara, etc.?

Since the Karandavyuha Sutra mentions Brahma, Indra, Varuna, and all sorts of gods arising from the body of Avalokiteshvara, are they supposed to being literal beings that arose from the body, "conceptions/roles/positions" that arose from a certain "essence," or what? Is the position of "Prithvi," the Earth itself, always changing?

Would Hindus agree with these viewpoints of "Indra" constantly changing, "Ganga" constantly changing, etc? Or would they object and stay solid to the idea that Lord Shiva has always been the same "being" this entire time?

And finally, could you please cite where these explanations could be found? Thank you!

It's worth remembering that while the Dharma is eternal, from a historical perspective life certainly was pervaded by a lot more raw, in-your-face misery for most humans in ancient and medieval Asia than it is for the postmodern member of the developed world.

Personally i don't see the need to read a statement like "life is suffering" in a fundamentalist/literalist mode. When we read it more heuristically it can take on any number of nuances...I always read it in the sense of "life is pervaded by suffering." And danger lurks around every corner as a potential.

Kim is fighting with a figment. Buddha never said "life is suffering," he said "sarva dukkham," all is suffering. Then you have to discern what is the "all" to which he is referring. The all to which he is referring is the six sense gates.

It seems to me that one way to cut through this problem would be to get people to use the  titles granted to them in the language of their tradition.

Malcolm wrote:
There is a major difference between this forum and E-Sangha. At its peak that latter had 50,000 users. There were child predators and charlatans, people posing as teachers, etc. It was a major headache. This is why we felt we had to institute standards. At one point, I even had a to call the FBI to deal with a pedophile. Then Jundo decided to threaten to sue us, and forum began to split up. When it crashed, and the backups were lost in the process, that was the end of it. Then David copied E-Sangha, and opened Dhammawheel, then Dharmawheel.

As for titles, thats fine, but that presented another problem, especially with Zen. American Zen is not Japanese Zen, and often there is no official recognition of Zen teachers by Japanese institutions.

Also, in Tibetan Buddhism, there is no official system for handing out titles other than Geshe, Khenpo, and Tulku. It is all ad hoc. There are no official qualifications for assuming the title "Lama" other than being given the title by one's teacher or, as is often the case, moving to America and calling oneself Lama x (this is called ocean promotion). The exception to this is Geshe and Khenpo, these are rigorous 12-14 year programs, with official degrees, ranks, etc. But there are no geshes and khenpos here as far as I know.

Of course, I have various certificates from various teachers, the Kazhipa degree given to me by HH Sakya Trizen; the title ācārya (slob dpon) in the Sakya school granted to me by the Buddhist Chaplain of Harvard, and former administrative head for all Sakya monasteries in India; another is the "lama" title granted to me by the Nyingma abbot of a small Himalayan monastery in Solu Kombhu region who resides in New Orleans when he is not in Nepal; and my Tibetan Medical degree from Shang Shung, etc. but I don't use those here, just as I do not advertise my teaching here (or anywhere, for that matter).

Hi everyone,

According to Buddhism, there are four maras: the mara of Yama the Lord of Death, the mara of the kleshas, the mara of the contaminated aggregates and the mara of the son of the deva.

I have read many times that the mara of the son of the deva makes reference to the obstructor, the tempter that attempted to obstruct Prince Siddartha from attaining full enlightenment. To me, this mara is very similar to the christian concept of Satan.

At some times, I have also found that this type of mara, the son of the deva, symbolizes our craving for pleasure, satisfaction and convenience.

This being the case, my question is: which meaning is correct for the mara of the son of the deva?

Malcolm wrote:
Devaputra mara refers of Kamadeva, the ruler of the highest desire realm devas. Kamadeva is the Indian analogue of Cupid.

I would love us to have a better answer than that, to have a plain-English version of the First Noble Truth which reflects the deeper understanding that some of us have been working towards for years.

Queequeg said:
I'll work backwards on your questions.

Asking how this is different than a materialist claim is premature.

We need to define some terms here - by machine, are we talking about engineered, lab created biological "beings" (I'll put that in quotation marks for now because we're not sure if they are beings (sattva)), or are we talking about some sort of electronic computer made with silicon circuits and chips and processors, maybe with robotic means of action? Either way, if such a thing was conscious (difficult to answer as that would go to the heart of the Hard Question), at the least, we'd have some re-evaluation to do - along the lines of Jambudvipa v. the reality of Earth evaluation.

Regarding your second question, I'd suggest a consciousness seeking rebirth that appropriates brain tissue in a vat had the causes and conditions to end up there.

Malcolm wrote:
Then explain those: in the case of four kinds of birth you mention, the process of conception is quite well described. Consciousness in three kinds of birth appropriate reproductive material from parents at the moment they meet. Since there are no mating parents for a brain in a vat, not sure how that can work.

For example, there is a connate of the cause, the connate of the path, and the connate of the result, as detailed by Dombi Heruka in his Sahajasiddhi. According to him, the cause, the mind itself, is the connate nonarising reality of entities. And I provided a Saraha citation as well. So, basically, your objection is unnecessary.

I just opened the book randomly and put my finger on the page with closed eyes. My finger pointed the last paragraph on p. 751 :

(P. 751) It is the final endpoint to be-accomplished, and therefore it is the fruition. This is what it taken as the path. Therefore, it is called the “fruition path.” If we were to categorize that, we can follow after what is said by the great teacher Drenpa Namkha in his Nam mkha’ ‘phrul mdzod [Treasury of the Magical Display of Space) where it says, “The practitioner of Great Completion who accepts the difference as being self-arising, with a knife cuts the rope of everything to-be-known, and such a practitioner of Great Completion self-liberates everything into the source, the universal ground just as it is. Through that you set up [the mind] on the essential point, namely (p. 752) awakened awareness. Two things are shown. The first has ten schools of thoughts.”

The original in tibetan says (vol. II, p. 81) :
