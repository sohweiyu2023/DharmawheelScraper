In a different vein, Professor Marsha Freeman notes with regard to the constitution of the United States of America: “The US constitution, 14th Amendment, has been read to prohibit discrimination against women, but the test is not as rigorous as it is with respect to race discrimination-that is, women’s protection is to a lesser standard.” She later asserts: “The effort to expand the constitutional protection died a generation ago.”348 Other shortcomings were identified in the shadow report submitted to the Human Rights Committee prior to its consideration of the second and third reports of
the United States of America:

“The Fourteenth Amendment’s equal protection provision has not been consistently interpreted as protecting women from sex discrimination, and it has not been interpreted to require strict scrutiny of sex-based classifications. Instead, the standard ranges from requiring a ‘rational basis’ for sex-based distinctions to requiring an ‘exceedingly persuasive’ justification. The Fourteenth Amendment has not been] interpreted to apply to sexual orientation or gender identity discrimination. Nor does it protect women from discrimination on the basis of pregnancy or childbirth. Further, the amendment has been interpreted to require a demonstration of discriminatory intent; it is not sufficient that a law or policy has a disproportionate impact on one sex.

Women point out sexism towards them = hero's, victims, deserve sympathy.
Males point out sexism towards them = Misogynist, racists, deserves condemnation

Any criticism of feminism automatically makes you prejudiced, and racist, and deluded. There's no need to examine facts, or counterarguments because the forgone conclusion is that anyone who challenges feminism is bad and in need of correction.

Malcolm wrote:
Sexism and racism are a function of power differentials. Sexism is not just biases like "A women's place is in the kitchen." That is too simplistic.

Gender disparity includes all kinds of issues, like unrecognized household work, the fact that there are very few women in STEM occupations, which are 90% men; that professions where women dominate are sorely underpaid, and even then, women in these positions make less than their make counterparts.

In order to prove that there is systematic sexism against men in our society, you would have to also demonstrate the power differentials through which such disparities happen. Claiming for example that most military casualties are male, for example, is a clear result of barring women from active combat duty until just a couple of weeks ago.

There is no sexism against white men. There are consequences for white men, such as a diminishing power differential in our society that causes some white men to feel discriminated against, but anyone who thinks that there is sufficient gender parity in this society to make the claim that there is a serious problem of discrimination against men is just laughable, the sort of ignorant silliness one sees on Fox and Friends.

And yes, there is a connection between racism and sexism, both are a result of patriarchy, so indeed sexism and racism do go hand in hand.

The fact that he recounts different transmission lineages, for example, differentiating Ngog's from Zu, does not make his over all presentation gzhan stong, despite his own obvious preferences. Likewise, Dolbupa's commentary on the Uttaratantra is pretty disappointing if you are looking for some defining gzhan stong feature in it, which it utterly lacks.


Unknown said:
The rangtong-zhentong dichotomy was invented by gzhan stong pas themselves, decades before Tsongkhapa wrote a single word. Rang stong is straw man invented by the gzhan stong pas.  Nobody accepts that the distinction actually exists apart from gzhan stong pas.

Malcolm wrote:
The distinction between affirming and non-affirming negation obviously exists, only the terminology is in dispute.  If you think it is not useful at the present time, that is another matter.  My (Kagyu) teachers think it is useful.
[/quote]

These negations are not necessarily understood the same way by everyone. But it has become fashionable to assume that the Gelug definition of a non-affirming negation is the one that is universally meant. For example, Rongzom clearly defines the affirming negation as a proof of your own position, whereas a non-affirming negation is the rejection of another's position. So for him, the Madhyamaka only uses the non-affirming negation, they do not use an affirming negation at all since they have no position to prove, viz existence or nonexistence. {He criticizes Madhyamaka however, also, for other reasons].

Basically both rang stong and gzhan stong are easily refuted just by looking at the MMK. The refutation of rang stong is:
If there were something subtle that was not empty there would be something subtle to be empty;
but as there is nothing not empty, where is there something to be empty?
The refutation of gzhan stong is:
Since arising, abiding and ceasing are are not established, the conditioned is not established, 
if the conditioned is not established, how can the unconditioned be established?
There is no object of refutation not included in these two stanzas of the MMK, and they are unassailable. Simply put, gzhan stong is a view more crude than real Madhyamaka. It can be a stepping stone to a more subtle view, but it is not itself that subtle.

Jamgon Kongtrul gives a lineage in his introduction to the Uttaratantrashastra.  I'm sure Brunnholzl is quite correct in his tracing of the lineage.  I'm just stressing for Zhentongpas the origins are the sutras on the Buddha nature, as well as Maitreya's 5 shastras, especially the Uttaratantrashastra.  So to say it is a combination of yogacara - which normally means the teachings of Asanga and Vasubhandu - and tathagatagarbha, is not really accurate.

The Sakya position, at least as outlined by Gorampa, is that neither clarity nor emptiness can be considered suitable basis for tathāgatagarbha, i.e. a suitable basis for liberation. It can't be clarity, because in the Sakya system, clarity is considered conditioned; it can't be emptiness, because that would be the same as an arhat's cessation. The union of clarity and emptiness can be considered tathāgatagarbha because that union itself is unconditioned. But Gorampa would never admit that tathāgatagarbha is conditioned. To claim so is to contradict the Buddha directly. Why? For the simple reason that the tagāthagarbha is a just a name for dharmakāya encased in afflictions; but that dharmakāya is always unconditioned.

Specifically it was Mamo dances performed at a harvest festival. Nevertheless, to this day the main practice of the Khon remains Nyingma.

The main eight deity Sakya protectors also come from terma lineages, as witnessed by their inclusion in the Rinchen Terzö. \

So are we going to maintain that all of these formerly secret practices that have now been published, such as Mahamudra, Lamdre, Dzogchen, Kalacakra, Lama Chopa, etc., are all finished because their details can be found in any major library? I think not. The teachings of the Dharma do not not become ineffective because they are disseminated. They become ineffective, if, like medicine, they are not taken.

In any case, what causes problems in the lineage is not publishing books, that is the least of it. Problems in a lineage come when a) the guru is not a qualified one, b) students fight with each other.

This may also be the reason that, as Dudjom Rinpoche said, these days Nyingmapa practice is especially dependent on the tertons, as tertons go to the source as it were, and get a fresh start.  Frequently termas are referred to as "still having the warm breath of the dakinis attached to them".

Malcolm wrote:
There is no doubt termas are important, but not because of the information contained in the texts. They are important because of the shortness of the lineage. Such revelations actually contain nothing new or different than what has come before and is older. And we should keep in mind what Nyangral Nyima Ozer writes in his catalogue for the Dharma of the Great Ḍākinī [ Mkha 'gro chen mo'i chos ]:

This does not mean the contents of those teachings are actually "secret" in the sense that the information in them is not contained in a hundred different texts. It just means that the lamas in question value the integrity of the lineage to a certain degree and wish to give it only to a few disciples. An example of this is the Sde gsum teachings of the Choling Tersar. Lineage is regarded as more important than the actual information in the body of the teachings, upadeshas are favored over tantras, etc.

Techno Yogi said:
This article discusses emptiness from a Madhamikya perspective, and uses a concrete example (growing carrots) to explain it:

If phenomena don’t independently exist than how do they exist? The Middle Way tells us that they dependently exist in three fundamental ways. First, phenomena exist dependent upon causes and conditions. For example, carrots depend upon soil, sunlight, moisture, freedom from rodents, and so forth. Second, phenomena depend upon the whole and its parts. Carrots depend upon its greens, stem, root hairs, and so on and the totality of all these parts. Third, and most profoundly, phenomena depend upon mental imputation, attribution, or designation. From the rich panoply of experience, I collect the sense qualities, personal associations, and psychological reactions to carrots together, and name them or designate them as "carrot." The mind’s proper functioning is to construct its world, the only world we can know. The error enters because along with naming comes the false attribution of inherent existence, that foundation for desire and aversion.

For the Middle Way, dependent arising is a complementary way of describing emptiness. We can understand them as two different views of the same truth. Therefore, contrary to our untutored beliefs, the ultimate nature of phenomena is its dependency and relatedness, not isolated existence and independence.

Malcolm wrote:
This is a completely incorrect explanation of the Madhyamaka. There is no such thing as "dependent existence" in Madhyamaka teachings.

One, we have to recall that these texts were never secret from an elite set of people in India and Tibet.

Second, we have to realize that tantras as texts are artifacts, books written down by human beings, with all the limitations that entails.

Third, masters such as HHDL has said that tantric secrecy can actually be harmful to the teachings in the present epoch, because secrecy inspires fear.

Fourth, texts like Dzogchen tantras are very tame in comparison with some of more "anti-nomian" Indian tantras. The former have virtually no erotic imagery, virtually no descriptions of rites of magic and sorcery, unlike say Hevajra or Kalacakra, or even Guhyasamaja and many of the lower tantras. If Dzogchen tantras were kept secret, it is because they present a narrative of liberation and buddhahood that is not consistent with the gradualist Buddhism that became the state religion of Tibet.

The reason why I have been opening a new topic is, because of a recent exchange I had with an acquaintance of mine, who is an Advaitin and at the same time practices Dzogchen.

I have a very odd feeling with the whole arrangement; especially with his argumentation that lines between Buddhism and Hinduism are not so clear-cut as it may appear and that Buddhism anyway adopted many texts and teachings from Hinduism. One example he gives is the fire-ritual or homa (although I do not understand what relevance does this have for Dzogchen). He also admits that Hinduism in turn took over some Buddhist elements.

Still, it all sounds very strange.

I would like to request the participants in this discussion to focus strictly on the false view in Dzogchen i.e. how it is being defined, the relevant quotes from primary sources (authoritative and accepted Dzogchen texts), the words of authentic and also living Dzogchen masters as well as the consequences of such falses view for the practice of Dzogchen itself (the last point is of particular importance).

I do not want to sound bigoted or parochial when discussing with my friend. But on the other hand there are certain things one cannot simply explain away - even for the superficial purposes of some "religious" harmony or tolerance.

Malcolm wrote:
False view in Dzogchen is quite simply any view of existence or nonexistence. For example, the Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra states:
Such false views as those
are held to be gathered into four:
tīrthikās, extremists, 
hedonists and cārvākas. 
The system of explaining these is as follows:
tīrthikās maintain permanent eternalism;
extremists maintain partial eternalism, partial annihilation;
hedonists maintain that annihilation is total annihilation;
Cārvākas maintain the annihilation of karmic results.

As such, the three hundred and sixty views as well
can be gathered into four categories. 
Further those can be included
in eternalism and annihilationism. 
Those can also be included in meaningless nihilism.
This is the extent of the worldly views.

There is no discussion of these in the Uttaratantra, per se. The Yogacara masters were not that interested in tathagatagarbha, quite frankly.

The point I don't fully accept is this:
For that reason, when we talk about our “individual mental continuum,” it doesn’t come from the body – in other words, from matter and energy. Each moment of our individual mental continuum has to come from a previous moment of an individual, subjective experiencing of things. And it can’t come from somebody else’s individual, subjective experiencing of things, such as that of our parents. It can only be part of the continuum of our own individual, subjective experiencing of things.
Obviously, there is a relationship (and ultimately non-duality) between body and mind. And it is true that as far as we know, physical phenomenon don't become mental and vice versa. But why is it not possible for physical phenomenon to give rise to mental phenomenon? For example, when you hit my body with a piece of wood, pain arises. So while the wood doesn't become pain, it certainly produces it in a conventional way. So why can't physical phenomenon likewise "cause" the mind-stream to arise?

Instead, the notion of a basis [gzhi] is really only brought up in chapter iv. It begins on 173 by saying:
It is taught in scriptures that worlds and beings
Are created by various actions influenced by subtle and proliferation [emotions].
He then continues by listing the various approaches to the how the world and beings are created in various tenet systems. He then gives the Kalacakara account on 176:
"Most agree that in the formation [of the world], the mind is the agent..."
This whole section, up to page 181, takes the individual mind as the basis for the formation of the universe.

He the shifts to Hinayāna and Mahāyāna cosmology from 182 until 195.

He then introduces what he terms the ultimate view concerning the origin of samsara and the Dzogchen view.

The first is a detailed presentation of dependent origination. On 198, in the section on the relationship between dependent origination and the eight consciousnesses, he writes:
"The beginningless nature of the mind is clear, empty, [and] unobstructed,
but its nature is not recognized...
Thus far, the basis described in the whole book is the mind or the nature of the mind.

It is only at the conclusion of this section that Kongtrul begins a description of the Dzogchen teaching on the basis. And there is nothing there which validates your interpretation that it is a so called transpersonal basis.

Ok, so "the 8 consciousnesses themselves arise from the delusion of not recognizing the basis when it arises". So the basis is more fundamental than the 8 consciousnesses, right? And the basis it what is not recognized "when it arises", right?

Malcolm wrote:
The basis is nothing other than the self-originated pristine consciousness mentioned above. Also the ignorance that gives rise to the eight consciousnesses, etc. is just the ignorance [ma rig pa] which is the manifestation of rig pa itself, as mentioned on 215. So for example, he states on 222 that the five wisdoms of rig pa manifest as the five aggregates and so on. Not the five aggregates of all sentient beings, just your own five aggregates. Likewise, they then arise as the five afflictions, etc. Paragraph 2 on pg. 224., summarizes the six sets of five that arise from and are present in rig pa.

So that sentence includes the absence of referents and the appearance of the images--in the same sentence. That's kinda hard to work around.

"He also said that the Dzinpa Rangdröl cycle was very complete starting with Ngöndro, followed by the yidam practices of Tsogyel Karmo (White Tsogyel) and Tröma, and then proceeding through the six yogas, and ending with Dzog Chen in a section very similar to Tri Yeshe Lama (Jigme Lingpa’s Dzog Chen cycle from Longchen Nyingtig) which includes complete Trekchö and Tögal instructions. He also mentioned that Dzinpa Rangdröl contains several Chöd practices and many Dzog Chen men­ngags (pith instructions)."

Second, we have no evidence whatsoever of any thögal like teachings being written down by anyone until the early 11th century, whether Buddhist or Bon.

In terms of unique doctrines, the most unique thing in Bonpo Dzogchen is ZZNG's emphasis on sounds, lights and rays, which really only figures in the ZZNG, and it pretty much absent from other Bonpo Dzogchen cycles, based on a electronic word search conducted on the other two main cycles of Dzogchen in Bon.

While I would have no complaints about sourcing Dzogchen in Central Asia, within the sphere of Indian cultural influence, I see absolutely no evidence which links Dzogchen doctrines with teachings generally outside of Buddhadharma and the Indian context.

I was just listening to a Dharma Ocean podcast (130: Pure Awareness) and Reggie Ray said some things which he said may be a bit heretical to some but actually are historically accurate. To me it sounds very odd, and I haven't heard these things before. I was hoping someone with more experience can comment about the points he makes? I typed up the relevant stuff. Is any of it true? Is there any evidence of Chan influence on Mahamudra?

What we call Mahamudra tradition is result of profound interaction of Daoism, Chan Buddhism, and Dzogchen. Mahamudra came out of that. There’s a lot of Daoism in Mahamudra, and a lot of Chan Buddhism in Mahamudra.

In the 8th century in Tibet, there was a very famous conversation about what is the best Buddhism for Tibet, and an edict which has been found in the Dun Huang documents buried and survived. The edict says the most important tradition for Tibet and the meditative tradition everyone should practice is Chan Buddhism. What happened later was the Indian crew showed up and they took over the power in Tibet. This was like in the 11th/12th century and they made it illegal to practice anything that was from China. So all of the records were rewritten to show that everything that was good in Tibet came from India but actually this was a complete fabrication. There is extensive evidence that Mahamudra is the result of the confluence of Chan Buddhism, Daoism, and Dzogchen. They were part of the same tradition. Well you can say what is that tradition? It’s the practice of pure awareness. They were all doing it, and they were talking to each other.

There’s a tradition called Sutra Mahamudra taught by Gampopa which has now been more or less proved was a Chan lineage in Tibet but because of the politics they could not acknowledge their source.

I called up my friends and academic friends, and they said, yeah that’s how it is. The history of Tibetan Buddhism promoted in Tibet is a complete fabrication.

It’s often said that Chan Buddhism is Daoism in a Buddhist form . . . What happened was, the Buddhists saved Daoism in China. Because Daoism after the Han Dynasty began to become very conventional religion. The Buddhists showed up from India and realized like holy shit, these people understand more about awareness than we do. And they incorporate the depths of Daoism, and they gave Daoism the container and practice and gave Daoism a way to survive.

It is not an unjust imposition of a monopoly; the de facto monopoly grows by an invisible-hand process and by morally permissible means, without anyone’s rights being violated and without any claims being made to a special right that others do not possess. And requiring the clients of the de facto monopoly to pay for the protection of those they prohibit from self-help enforcement against them, far from being immoral, is morally required by the principle of compensation adumbrated in Chapter 4.

Depends on what you mean by old. Chronologically, it is a terma that was probably revealed during the 13th century. That being said, I have never seen a clear account of its revelation anywhere, unlike say, that of the 17 tantras. However, the Khandro Nyingthig is a self-described commentary on it, and since it dates to the early 14th, it is a good guess that this tantra was revealed in the 13th. It seems the first cycle of teachings that mention its existence is the Khandro Nyinthig. Also, in the 14th century, Dorje Lingpa revealed further tantras with similar names.

This may be a long shot but here it goes: A few years back I remember reading a classic text which contained a verse in a criticism/response format, where a generic "Theravadan" make a criticism of the authority of Mahayana texts. The "Response:" was something along the lines of how the Theravadan texts were not written by the Victor nor could they reliably relay his teachings. I believe later in the text it talked about knowingly and intentionally prefacing Mahayanan texts as if they relayed teachings taught by the Victor, but doing so specifically to draw new followers and protect these people from thinking the Theravadan texts were more authoritative because they were prefaced in a similar way (as if they were reliably relaying teachings traceable to the Buddha).

Another form of contraception approved by the FDA – the copper Intrauterine Device CuT380A (Cu-IUD) – is effective as an EC when inserted up to five days following intercourse. Copper ions released from the IUD create an environment that is toxic to sperm, preventing fertilization.14 Copper can also alter the endometrial lining, but studies show that this alteration can prevent implantation, but not disrupt implantation. Because Cu-IUDs prevent rather than disrupt pregnancy, they too are properly classified as contraceptives, not abortifacients.

The classical Buddhist approach is to say that three things are necessary: white essence of the father, red essence of the mother, and the presence of a "gandharva".

Further, a gandharva -- the name means "feeds on fragrance" --  is some sort of discarnate being, though how precisely this gandharva is supposed to relate to the vijnana, which is said to be that aspect of a person's mental functioning that is carried over from one life to the next, is something I have never seen well explained -- perhaps someone here will have a better idea.

It is a good idea to tell people they should go and receive Dzogchen teachings. Once they have received Dzogchen teachings, they can decide for themselves whether they wish to make use of the methods of the lower yānas or not, depending on their circumstances.

There is also the chulen pill for doing chulen practice, and the famous mani pills which are blessed with recitations of mani mantras. It seems that HH the Dalai Lama's temple does produce a dutsi chömen pill as part of a medicine retreat, but I'm not clear what the nature of that pill is. I also happen to possess some pills from Ganden Jangtse which contain various substances such as tormas used in rituals performed by HH the Dalai Lama, substances from the two tutors, substances such as blessed vase water from the practices of deities of the four classes of tantra and the extensive consecration ritual, etc etc.

Od' sal taught for example in the Jñānavajrasammucaya tantra is the same thing we are discussingL:
That which arises from luminosity
is “mind,” [citta] “intellect,” [manas] and consciousness” [vijñāna]
which forms the foundation of all phenomena.
And:
Further, luminosity is nonabiding,
does not cease nor does it arise,
ultimate, the limit of reality.
Here, in order to explain the reality [gnas lugs] of all phenomena, since that which arises from luminosity is a nonconceptual knowing awareness arising (at the same time as a subtle vāyu) from dharmatā, the dhātu of naturally pure luminosity, the mind is the basis of everything [aḹaya, kun gzhi]. The mental consciousness [manovijñāna] expands and contracts. Consciousness possesses an eight-fold group. 

The foundation of all phenomena is bodhicitta, an unchanging vajra that is equal with space.
This is basically the same thing that Dzogchen is getting at, with the difference that here in this tantra, bodhicitta is defined as the union of the relative and ultimate. Dzogchen however dispenses with the distinction altogether, regarding it as a deviation. An ancient commentary found in the Bairo brgyud 'bum on The Soaring Great Garuda [one of the five earlier extracts translated by Vairocana] explains:

[T]o demonstrate the deviation of madhyamaka: here, since the two truths have been inseparable from the beginning, the two truths are not presented individually even conventionally. Having divided up the dharmatā and dharmin into relative and ultimate, training in the ultimate as supreme is the deviation of madhyamaka, as it is said:
Since phenomena and nonphenomena have always been merged and are inseparable,
there is no further need to explain an “ultimate phenomenon”.



Needless to say, the luminosity discussed above is not the luminosity discussed in the completion stage of the Guhyasamaja.

Maybe so, but I think your caution bears repeating.  Literary Chinese presents its own challenges and possibilities as a medium for Dharma transmission.  Context matters tremendously, so someone attempting a comparative study would need to have a very firm grip on how Huang Po uses this concept throughout his known writings.

Astus said:
Choosing Huangbo is a good start. Now for comparison's sake we also need a single Dzogchen text to work with, one that's been translated a few times to English and contains enough information (e.g. definitions).

Malcolm wrote:
We already have such a text, it is called bsam gtan mig dgron by Nubchen Sangye Yeshe. The advantage to that text is that is has many citations from seminal early Chan texts already translated into Tibetan by Tibetan and Chinese Chan practitioners during the 8th century.

Emptiness means conditioned, interacting. Sentience is living, connecting with events, phenomena influencing phenomena.

Malcolm wrote:
You mean there is no emptiness of the unconditioned? Emptiness means being free from all extremes, it does not mean being "conditioned." If it did, that would be a very inferior kind of emptiness.

Astus said:
Mind is sentient, perceptive, because impressions, emotions and thoughts move.

Malcolm wrote:
Wind moves, but it is neither sentient nor perceptive. Waves move, they are neither sentient nor perceptive. Clouds move, they are neither sentient nor perceptive. So it seems you definitive of sentient and perceptive because of the movement of thoughts, and so on is inadequate.

Are thoughts the same thing as the mind or are they different? If they are latter, how can a mind move inside of itself? Of they are different, how does their movement give the mind sentience?

Astus said:
If consciousness were unconditioned, it had no effect on anything and could not sense anything, that is, it were insentient.

Malcolm wrote:
Did anyone say consciousness [vijñāna] was unconditioned?


Astus said:
How is consciousness interdependent? Does it come from the sense organ or the object? Without either?
The 18 dhatus is a basic description of how consciousness is interdependent, further elaborations are found in abhidharma and yogacara materials. The mind-stream continues from the preceding mind to the present mind.

Malcolm wrote:
The eighteen dhātus does not actually explain how the mind is interdependent. It is a hinayāna model that assumes that a consciousness arises from the contact of sense object with a sense organ. In other words, it does not explain perception, it merely provides a taxonomy of our sensory apparatus.

Astus said:
Who said anything about an independent knower?
What you called the unconditioned knowing, the core and basis of mind and all appearances. It is unconditioned, therefore independent. It is knowing, what knows, so it is a knower, pure awareness.

Malcolm wrote:
This fault does not apply, just as the mind of which it is the core is not established, also the unconditioned vidyā is not established, is empty by nature and is not something real or truly existent.

Astus said:
This still does not explain the origin of consciousness, that is, how there can be a mind/consciousness at all.
Is there a situation where there is no mind?

Malcolm wrote:
Is there a situation in which the mind can be found?

Can consciousness occur from non-consciousness? Samsara is without a beginning, so is the mind-stream of beings.

Malcolm wrote:
This presumes two things, one, that there is fact a distinction between sentient and nonsentient. Two, it presumes that time exists independently.


Astus said:
Self-originated pristine consciousness is nondual emptiness and knowingness, termed "the nondual dharmadhātu and vidyā." Pristine consciousness [ ye shes, jn̄āna ] is the core of the mind, self-arisen, unconditioned, uncontaminated, unaffected by the three times. When it is not recognized, then through that ignorance its potentiality becomes mind, dependent origination and all the phenomena of samsara. When it is recognized, one is the peer of Buddha Samantabhadra.
Since it is unconditioned and unaffected, it cannot recognise or forget itself. So a second perceiver is required that is conditioned, and its core cannot be the unconditioned knowing.

Malcolm wrote:
Since unconditioned self-originated pristine consciousness is the core of a conditioned mind, it indeed can be forgotten by that conditioned mind, or as it more accurately the case, not recognized. It is just like someone who looks for their keys all over the house not recognizing that they are holding those very same keys in their hand.

Emptiness is unconditioned, but we have no problem describing it as the dharmatā of entities. Likewise, unconditioned, empty, self-originated pristine consciousness is the dharmatā of the mind.

My contemporary, Jawa Do Ngag, seized on the explanation of others that in the context of the luminosity of the meditation of the isolation of the mind in the Guhyasamāja’s Five Stages, original mind means a subtle mind. Beginning from that, he claims, “The vidyā the Great Perfection introduces is a subtle mind. Since that subtle mind is conditioned because it arises from four conditions, the Great Perfection is conditioned.” Also there are those who repeat this very inappropriate statement. 

In general, since the original mind [gnyug sems, ādyacitta] is the unconditioned luminous nature of the mind, that is also the sugatagarbha, but maintaining that is a conditioned mind is very erroneous. Since the luminosity of the completion stage of the Guhyasamaja is explained to be conditioned, [15/a] if this is the special feature to be revealed, color that however you like. Though I have no wish to express a refutation of that [the completion stage of Guhyasamaja], don’t mix that up with the Great Perfection.

It is well known through the Dharma of the tantras, agamas and upadeśas of the Great Perfection, the teachings of Omniscient Longchenpa up to the lineage of gurus of Kama and Terma of the present day that unconditioned vidyā is introduced as the dharmatā of the union of clarity and emptiness.

Emptiness of the mind and the knowingness of the mind, called the dharmatā of the mind are ultimate, not relative.

Many followers of Dharma perceive dependent origination to be an external fact or law that governs the production of phenomena.

But from a Dzogchen point of view, dependent origination only begins from the phase of ignorance called the imputing ignorance [ kun brtags ma rig pa ]. Prior to this, there is no dependent origination to speak of. For example, for a buddha who sees things just as they are, there is no dependent origination at all. The Guhyagarbha states:
Buddhas themselves never find

心 translates the Sanskrit citta, correct?  if so, then there's some basis for working out a textual comparison between Dzogchen and Ch'an on the basis of "mind."

Astus said:
I wouldn't go there. Chan is mainly about translating the Dharma to common Chinese and not about transplanting Indian Buddhism, as that's already happened through other channels. Although Chan teachers were (almost?) exclusively educated elite monastics, so references to texts and concepts of Indian origin is not unusual, but it is not the main characteristics of the tradition. There is even a slight division between the so called eight schools to Chinese (Tiantai, Huayan, Chan, Jingtu (Pure Land)) and Indian (Madhyamaka (Sanlun), Yogacara (Faxiang), Vinaya (Lu), Mantra (Zhenyan)), that signifies mostly their origin in a sense.

Xin (心) can mean all sorts of things, even contradictory ones within the same sentence. Or as an illustration for its versatile use, here is the entry from the Soothill-Hodus dictionary of Chinese Buddhism:
心
hrd, hrdaya 汗栗太 (or 汗栗馱); 紀哩馱 the heart, mind, soul; citta 質多 the heart as the seat of thought or intelligence. In both senses the heart is likened to a lotus. There are various definitions, of which the following are six instances: (1) 肉團心 hrd, the physical heart of sentient or nonsentient living beings, e. g. men, trees, etc. (2) 集起心 citta, the ālayavijñāna, or totality of mind, and the source of all mental activity. (3) 思量心 manas, the thinking and calculating mind; (4) 緣慮心; 了別心; 慮知心; citta; the discriminating mind; (5) 堅實心 the bhūtatathatā mind, or the permanent mind; (6) 積聚精要心 the mind essence of the sutras.

gZhan stong pas by contrast try to map the three natures onto the two truths, thereby distorting both doctrines, claiming that perfected nature [ultimate] is empty of both the imagined and the dependent [relative].

It's nothing like that. You can change that word to consciousness or mind.

Yes, and for this reason, you don't really get the sense of Dzogchen. Mipham writes:
[The] meaning explained by the term, “Great Perfection, the luminous mind essence” is the dharmatā of the mind, self-originated pristine consciousness, nothing other than the dharmadhātu, the reality of the original basis, and the total uniformity of union. Since it does not change with the three times, it is totally unconditioned, but there is no chance for there to arise here the subject, a momentary impermanent conditioned mind, and the unreal sole emptiness that is a mere object to refute by reasoning. Therefore, the Great Perfection of the basis or this totally unconditioned union of the luminosity of the basis, is the ultimate reality of all phenomena.

As long as you think the unconditioned nature of the mind is merely emptiness, for that long you will never understand either Dzogchen or Mahāmudra.
Mind, per definition, is conscious. To say that the mind is empty is to say that awareness is empty. It's not denying awareness, nor is it reducing it to insentience. Awareness is the interdependent stream of experiences, and it is not separate from its insubstantiality. Mind is conditioned, that's why it is without essence, otherwise it would not function at all. So being conditioned is the unconditioned, and unconditioned is the conditioned itself. How is that wrong for Dzogchen?

Sure there are. Take for example, the Summary of the Great Vehicle [BDK edition], chapter 2, section 25. states "Since the other-dependent does not really exist as it appears, how does one know that it is not entirely nonexistent? If there were no other-dependent pattern, the reality pattern would also be nonexistent and then one would come to affirm universal nothingness. And then, if the other-dependent pattern both did not exist, one would fall into the error about the being and nonbeing of defilement and purification. But since these states can be known not to be nothing, it is not true that all is nothing." [pg. 51]

Candrakiriti's rebuttal to this is quite famous between MAV 6.72...
If there is an entity such as the dependent, empty of duality
lacking apprehended objects, devoid of an apprehending subject,
by whom is the existence of this entity known? 
It is not reasonable says that which cannot be apprehended "exists."

...

If there exists such an entity as the other-dependent nature
that is nonarisen and unknowable,
the existence of this cannot be known by anyone,
like the harm caused by the son of a barren women to others.

When the other-dependent does not exist at all, 
what can be a cause of the relative [in your system]?
On the other hand, the presentation
which is known to the world is is destroyed.

With respect to the Yogacara school, they do indeed posit an ultimate consciousness — it is the meaning of line of Madhyantavibhaga, "The imagination of the unreal exists..." and so on, though I understand it is fashionable these days to try and rescue Yogacara from being hoisted on its own petard.

Astus said:
As I read it, the Madhyantavibhaga there says nothing different from what Nagarjuna writes about the equality between dependent origination and emptiness. It is also repeated in how the three natures are explained. If that means Yogacara is at fault, then so is Madhyamaka.

Malcolm wrote:
The Madhyantavibhaga is basically asserting that the perfect is the absence of the imagined in the dependent. The dependent however is never refuted. It is the emptiness that exists in which no duality exists.

Frankly, I am a little surprised that you don't understand the difference between Madhyamaka and Yogacara. Yogacarins and Madhymakas in India certainly understood the differences between their respective schools, and there is an extensive polemical literature which exists between them detailing the differences.

Astus said:
That's quite a huge point, putting Yogacara into the position of not only a less developed view, but actually means that they massively failed in setting up a coherent system.

There are indeed some glaring internal contradictions in the Yogacara system of Maitreya, Asanga, Vasubandhu and their followers. For example, Arya Vimuktesena directly take his teacher, Vasubandhu, to task for some of those inconsistencies.

Sorry but you cannot explain away the irrationality of this linguistic expression.

Malcolm wrote:
It is not something which is meant to be taken literally. In other words, you think it means that Nāgārjuna is claiming the Buddha said that everything is simultaneously real, unreal, both and neither. If that is what he meant, I would agree with you that such a statement would be irrational gibberish.

Fortunately, there is plenty of evidence to show this is not what Nāgārjuna meant.

Buddhapalita explains that what is meant by this statement is that whatever is known to exist according to worldly convention, the Buddha states that exists. Whatever is known to not exist according to worldly convention, the Buddha states that does not exist.

Whatever is known to be true according to worldly convention, the Buddha states that is true. Whatever is known to be false according to worldly convention, the Buddha states that is false.

Whatever is stated to be true and false in worldly convention the Buddha states that is true and false. Buddhapalita gives the following example: two men who go into a temple have a dispute about the murals in the temple; one man wrongly claims that Vishnu holds a trident and Shiva holds a wheel. The other main correctly claims Shiva holds a trident and Vishnu holds a wheel. Thus in this case the Buddha in accordance with worldly convention will disagree with the former and agree with the latter.

And finally, as example of the last, there is one man outside who says to them both, you are neither right nor wrong, those are paintings, and so according to mundane convention, the claim of former man is not true and neither is the claim of the latter man. Both of their claims are false since Shiva and Vishnu are not present in the temple at all.

Buddhapalita continues by saying that the Buddha, who sees the emptiness of all things, can say "this is true; this is not true; this is both; this is neither" and so on in accordance with worldly conventions.

a nonexistent does not arise from an existent;
a nonexistent does not arise from a nonexistent;

The reason I brought that citation is to show that the difference between knowing and unknowing lies in the presence or absence of dual vision. Self-awareness is another matter.

Malcolm wrote:
The term svasaṃvedana does not mean "self-aware," it means that knowing is an intrinsic capacity for the mind to does not depend on an external object, in contradistinction to the Vaibhashika and Sautrantika contention that an instance of knowing depends on an object and a sense organ to arise.

With respect to the Yogacara school, they do indeed posit an ultimate consciousness — it is the meaning of line of Madhyantavibhaga, "The imagination of the unreal exists..." and so on, though I understand it is fashionable these days to try and rescue Yogacara from being hoisted on its own petard.

it is not at all the pristine consciousness of vidyā [rig pa'i ye shes].

Everything I write is a linguistic truth and it can only become a conventional truth for you if you agree with the linguistic expression I am applying.

Malcolm wrote:
Frankly, this what you do not understand about Madhyamaka. Madhyamaka is not about linguistic assignations. It is about shared perceptions which are then, only after the fact, given labels.

For example, we have human eyes, we see the see the same sets of colors because humans have evolved to see a certain range of light on the electromagnetic scale [we can regard this as self-evident].

My and your ability to see red, yellow and blue is not predicated on our having words for these colors before we see them. It is only after we see them, and come together, that we have together given them linguistics assignations. "Truths" are defined in Madhyamaka as perceptions, not linguistic designations.
"given percept", "the objects of deluded cognitions", "the percept" are your linguistic truths. I do not think that we share a convention as to these linguistic expressions.
These are not mere "linguistic" truths -- these facts are demonstrable in Madhyamaka writings. For example, Nāgārjuna writes:
If a name and its meaning were not different, 
the name "fire" would burn the mouth;
if they were different, nothing could be comprehended.
Here, Nāgārjuan is pointing out that so called conventional truth is not merely dependent upon names, as he writes:
Without an object to be felt, 
feeling would not exist, 
therefore, it is without a self. 
You maintain that object to be felt lacks a nature.
At this point, this conversation is like two old guys at the docks at sunset —— one guy looks at the sunset, and says "this is amazing", the other guy looks at it and says. "I've seen better."

The conventional truth they share is the fact that they both see a sun going down, they share a perception. Their "linguistic truth" is their subjective opinion about the aesthetic quality of the sunset. However, it is a little worse than that. This conversation is actually like two guys seeing the same sun set, and one of the guys claiming there is no sun setting at all —— and not because the sunset is produced by the rotation of the earth, rather then the sun rising and falling in the sky.

It is examples such as these which shows you have deeply misunderstood the meaning of Nāgārjuna.

You may be entitled to your own "linguistic truths", however mistaken they may be; but you are not entitled to your own facts.

In the same way, when examined from the perspective of the emptiness that is free from all proliferation of the four extremes that is explained in the Perfection Vehicle, since there are no phenomena not pervaded by that emptiness, there indeed is a good argument that confirms that if there is a view better than that, that view would become a proliferation.

However, when examined from the perspective of realizing the dhātu (the object to be realized), or the method (great bliss), the view of mantra is very superior because the mind is very near the reality of the object [the dharmadhātu].
Why is the mind very near the reality of the object? After the first statement I presented above, Mipham claims:
Here [in the Great Perfection], since the pristine consciousness that exists within oneself is immediately apprehended just as it is with the intimate instruction of the critical point of the introduction, it becomes intrinsically clear to oneself without the need to be involved in a huge net of conceptual fabrications. That being so, once the result of all progress is attained, there is no rationale in hoping for another vehicle.
Thus the view in Dzogchen is the direct perception of pristine consciousness introduced by the guru, it is not a result of intellectual analysis.

Yes, both good and bad dharmas are empty, kleshas are bodhi, and samsara is nirvana. That is not the same as refuting/denying the conventional existence of wholesome and unwholesome for deluded beings, as the driving forces behind the various forms of birth, as stated in the referenced aspiration prayer for instance. I did not say that Dzogchen uses specific antidotes, just that it recognises the function of various mental inclinations.

Malcolm wrote:
Your statement was:

Astus said:
Dzogchen maintains the distinction between wholesome and unwholesome, otherwise it'd be in denial in a way they accuse Hashang's doctrine. It's just that in terms of view one realises that all phenomena are empty, thus no need to grasp or reject. Same is taught in Theravada with the contemplation on the three characteristics.

Malcolm wrote:
You used this phrase in order to somehow make Theravada and other Hinayāna paths compatible with Dzogchen. It is not that they are incompatible, per se, but they don't reach the point of view of Dzogchen teachings. They are incomplete, from a Dzogchen point of view.

Second, who are the "they" making accusations. What denial are you claiming would be a result if Dzogchen does not make this distinction?

Astus said:
We were on your point about union of appearance and emptiness.
And they are so, nobody claimed otherwise. What you seemed to object against was summing up the ultimate view as the two kinds of selflessness, I guess because it may be mistaken for some annihilationist extreme, while Dzogchen likes to equally emphasise awareness and emptiness as the inseparable nature of mind.

Malcolm wrote:
In point of fact, Ju Mipham, since you invoked him, is not comfortable with the idea that there is a "union" or "nonduality" of appearance and emptiness, this is why he questions the idea.

The ultimate view of Dzogchen is not merely the two kinds of selflessness. It goes beyond that. Mipham's perspective, again, since you brought him up, is that the view of sūtra does not approach the view of mantra.

So says everyone else in Buddhism. Skilful and unskilful acts bring about karmic results within samsara, and I see no denial of that in Dzogchen either, since it does talk about the lower and higher realms.

Malcolm wrote:
The demonstration of the freedom of vidyā from virtue and non-virtue: “Freedom from virtuous and non-virtuous actions” means the yogin who perceives his own vidyā. Since this vidyā is connected with the oral instructions of a Guru, in reality, even a paṇḍita learned in the tripitika will not come into contact with even an iota [of this vidyā] if it is not demonstrated. Therefore, it is called “relying upon the methods of secret mantra.” If demonstrated, it can even be seen by a poor cowherd. Therefore,  it is “without good and bad karma”. If it is not practiced, not even Vajrasattva will be liberated. Therefore, “familiarity with the intimate instruction meets its measure”. Having practiced, even one who has committed the five limitless deeds will be liberated in this life. Therefore, it is called “unaffected by the benefit or harm of good and bad actions”. 
When vidyā is seen, since that alone is buddhahood and nothing else, one who nominally designates buddhahood is deluded. When vidyā is practiced, since hells do not exist, the one who designates hells has been taken by Māra. When vidyā reaches its full measure, it is shown that neither buddhas nor hell beings were ever established. Therefore, it is shown that there is not the slightest difference between Buddha Samantabhadra and the King of Hell, Dharmarāja.

The text goes on about the five poisons and how they're remedied by recognising the natural state. It also mentions the six realms here and there. Since it recognises the various types of births, as they depend on good and bad inclinations, it includes the system of the wholesome and unwholesome states. Of course, it is not really a text to get into the details of karma, but it is obviously presupposed.

Malcolm wrote:
The text says that there is a single basis, two paths and two results. It does not go into an analysis of accepting conditioned good things and rejecting conditioned bad things. It merely says that the difference between affliction and wisdom is vidyā and avidyā. It describes the state of samsara, but it does not recommend some practice of accepting and rejecting wholesome and unwholesome things. From the same text, my translation:
[M]ay all the sentient beings with clinging of desire
attain the pristine consciousness that realizes everything,
having mastered their own vidyā
through relaxing awareness into its own pristine state,
without externally giving up the torment of desire,
without internally adopting the clinging of desire.

The reply: “Guhyapati, listen! Since appearances automatically reversed, there is no need to purify bad karma and negative traces.

Rigpa is the knowing of reality, and such knowledge is the goal of Theravada as well. Assuming a self (an absolute) beyond the five aggregates is denied not only in Theravada but in Mahayana as well. There is also no disagreement in that it's not the skandhas themselves that are the problem but the attachment to them based on ignorance. So once reality is seen (no self inside, outside or in between the aggregates), there is no clinging, and without clinging there is liberation. Although that doesn't mean that there is no difference in terminology and in some methods.

No, the beings reporting their visions are conditioned to some extent (including Jamgon Kongtrul, reportedly a 7th bhumi Bodhisattva).  And we are conditioned as well.  So great lamas like Jamgom Kongtrul and Chatral Rinpoche use conditioned language to talk to us about their experiences (for example, Chatral Rinpoche's reported visions).

Awakened beings view the world from a purified perspective and that's the point (and since the form isn't a mere emptiness it is able to engage in the world so other teachings dealing with other aspects such as spontaneous arising, etc. are not excluded from the use of the image).
But for whom are these images, those to be tamed or those taming?
For those to be tamed and for teachers within a specific cultural milieu (see above - lamas reporting visions and otherwise communicating with us).  People who have "adopted" Buddhism also sometimes see images from within this cultural filter.

In any case, since the appearance of Buddhas and the words that they speak are delusions conforming to the expectations and inclinations of those to be tamed, if the Buddhas enunciate sexist things, it is the flaw of the disciple to be tamed, not the Buddhas. Even if this is the case however, and we use this a rationale to excuse the Buddhas of culpability for such words and attitudes, those words and attitudes must still be confronted, not wished away with platitudes and vain apologetics.

"Good man, it is in this sense that good men and good women who listen to this Mahayana Great Nirvana Sutra will always decry the marks that characterize a female and seek to be male . Why? Because this Mahayana scripture has the characteristic of manliness (pauru$a). I am referring to buddha-nature. If someone does not understand buddhanature, then he does not have male characteristics. Why do I say this? Because he cannot grasp the fact that the buddha-nature exists within himself. I would say those unable to know the buddha-nature are to be called women. I would say those who are able to know themselves that the buddha-nature exists are characteristically male. If a woman is able to know definitively that the buddha-nature exists within herself, you should know that this constitutes her as male."

The Buddha will teach whatever aspect of the Dharma is suitable to the situation. You are suggesting he would repudiate his teaching on unattractiveness and never teach it again. This sutta does not suggest that.

No, I am suggesting that he was surprised and appalled at how badly he was misunderstood by his students. He certainly indicates he had no idea of what was going on during his retreat in his absence.

Point taken.

Now let us discuss English. Do you believe Dharma in general, and Vajrayana in particular do not have:

"sacred rites" dedicated to a religious purpose and so deserving veneration

(of writing or text) embodying the laws or doctrines of a religion: a sacred text.

regarded with great respect and reverence by a particular religion, group, or individual; an "(whatever)" sacred to Tibetans

*******

If these definitions conform to the practice of Dharma then it is appropriate to us the word when discussing Dharma in English, right?

Malcolm wrote:
Quite honestly, the word never crosses my lips nor comes to mind with regard to the Dharma. I think in terms of what is liberative and nonliberative. I don't think that there really is anything in Buddhadharma that is "inviolable", "sacrosanct", etc. In fact, I think the term "sacred" is pretty dualistic. In order for something to be sacred, there has to something profane.

Of course I respect what other people hold to be "sacred," as long as it is not harmful to sentient beings. But since all phenomena are already perfect, where is there any room at all for the sacred or the profane? If you argue that we don't live in such knowledge and therefore, it is important that we have "sacred texts," "sacred rites," etc., you have just rendered your "sacred rites and texts" profane and mundane since they are only relevant to the ignorant and deluded.

It occurs to me that since the same terminology is used between Hinduism and Buddhism that "sacred Hindu text" may be very relevant.

Malcolm wrote:
My point is, that there is no word in either Buddhism or Hinduism that maps to the adjective. If you look in any Sanskrit dictionary you will find hundreds of things that are described as "sacred" — sacred this, sacred that, etc., not one single word maps to the word "sacred."

I suspect it is because the Buddhist/Hindu world view does not have heavily demarcated categories of sacred/profane.

Malcolm wrote:
In the beginning, Anglo settlers organized irregular units to brutally attack and destroy unarmed Indigenous women, children, and old people using unlimited violence in unrelenting attacks. During nearly two centuries of British colonization, generations of settlers, mostly farmers, gained experience as “Indian fighters” outside any organized military institution. Anglo-French conflict may appear to have been the dominant factor of European colonization in North America during the eighteenth century, but while large regular armies fought over geopolitical goals in Europe, Anglo settlers in North America waged deadly irregular warfare against the Indigenous communities. Much of the fighting during the fifteen-year settlers’ war for independence, especially in the Ohio Valley region and western New York, was directed against Indigenous resisters who realized it was not in their interest to have a close enemy of settlers with an independent government, as opposed to a remote one in Great Britain. Nor did the fledgling US military in the 1790s carry out operations typical of the state-centered wars occurring in Europe at the time. Even following the founding of the professional US Army in the 1810s, irregular warfare was the method of the US conquest of the Ohio Valley and Mississippi Valley regions. Since that time, Grenier notes, irregular methods have been used in tandem with operations of regular armed forces.

The chief characteristic of irregular warfare is that of the extreme violence against civilians, in this case the tendency to seek the utter annihilation of the Indigenous population. “In cases where a rough balance of power existed,” Grenier observes, “and the Indians even appeared dominant— as was the situation in virtually every frontier war until the first decade of the 19th century—[ settler] Americans were quick to turn to extravagant violence.”

Many historians who acknowledge the exceptional one-sided colonial violence attribute it to racism. Grenier argues that rather than racism leading to violence, the reverse occurred: the out-of-control momentum of extreme violence of unlimited warfare fueled race hatred. “Successive generations of Americans, both soldiers and civilians, made the killing of Indian men, women, and children a defining element of their first military tradition and thereby part of a shared American identity. Indeed, only after seventeenth- and early-eighteenth-century Americans made the first way of war a key to being a white American could later generations of ‘Indian haters,’ men like Andrew Jackson, turn the Indian wars into race wars.” By then, the Indigenous peoples’ villages, farmlands, towns, and entire nations formed the only barrier to the settlers’ total freedom to acquire land and wealth. Settler colonialists again chose their own means of conquest. Such fighters are often viewed as courageous heroes, but killing the unarmed women, children, and old people and burning homes and fields involved neither courage nor sacrifice. 

So it was from the planting of the first British colonies in North America. Among the initial leaders of those ventures were military men— mercenaries— who brought with them their previous war experiences in Britain’s imperialist, anti-Muslim Crusades. Those who put together and led the first colonial armies, such as John Smith in Virginia, Myles Standish at Plymouth, John Mason in Connecticut, and John Underhill in Massachusetts, had fought in the bitter, brutal, and bloody religious wars ongoing in Europe at the time of the first settlements. They had long practiced burning towns and fields and killing the unarmed and vulnerable. “Tragically for the Indian peoples of the Eastern Seaboard,” Grenier observes, “the mercenaries unleashed a similar way of war in early Virginia and New England.”

There is one feature in the expansion of the peoples of white, or European, blood during the past four centuries which should never be lost sight of, especially by those who denounce such expansion on moral grounds. On the whole, the movement has been fraught with lasting benefit to most of the peoples already dwelling in the lands over which the expansion took place.

The word "blessing" is very apt here. Why? The verb "to bless" comes from:

So, yes, our "blessings" comes from the blood our ancestors spilt on the altar of European incursions into the the new world.

Serenity509 said:
It would be wrong to say that whites never killed natives. But again, we must judge American history by the same standards we'd judge any other country's history.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, for in fact Europeans frequently killed natives, more often than not. As for India, we do not have an accurate historical record of the movements of Indo-aryans into India, all we have is myth and guesswork. But Europeans were so callous in their disregard to the First Peoples here, they willing wrote down accounts of murder and pillage without a second thought.
Documented policies of genocide on the part of US administrations can be identified in at least four distinct periods: the Jacksonian era of forced removal; the California gold rush in Northern California; the post– Civil War era of the so-called Indian wars in the Great Plains; and the 1950s termination period, all of which are discussed in the following chapters. Cases of genocide carried out as policy may be found in historical documents as well as in the oral histories of Indigenous communities. An example from 1873 is typical, with General William T. Sherman writing, “We must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sioux, even to their extermination, men, women and children … during an assault, the soldiers can not pause to distinguish between male and female, or even discriminate as to age.” As Patrick Wolfe has noted, the peculiarity of settler colonialism is that the goal is elimination of Indigenous populations in order to make land available to settlers. That project is not limited to government policy, but rather involves all kinds of agencies, voluntary militias, and the settlers themselves acting on their own.
Dunbar-Ortiz, Roxanne (2014-09-16). An Indigenous Peoples' History of the United States (ReVisioning American History) (pp. 9-10). Beacon Press. Kindle Edition.

Our blessings also come from the fact that as Americans, our colonial policies are so successful that indeed "the bottom five percent of Americans have a higher standard of living than 68% of the world's people" as you note. America is thus far the most successful experiment in European colonialism ever tried. It is important that we remember how we arose as a country, and not smother it in Hallmark sentiment.

I am not saying we need to feel some kind of white guilt about it all. I certainly don't. I am saying that we need to remember and never forget where our "blessings" come from and how they were gained.

As for my contention, you yourself know that Plato's Republic starts with an "aristocracy" and concludes with a tyranny. I don't share Plato's pessimism.

Arguably, however, it is Epicurus, through Lucretius's De rerum natura, who was perhaps the most influential Greek thinker during the revolutionary period.

This is NOT to say that rationality is not crucial in Buddhism; the acuity of the Buddhist teachers of the past in pointing out humanity's mental landscape is IMO one of two factors that have enabled Buddhism to continue over the centuries; the other factor is that individual practitioners of Buddhism have made their own the experience of what the sophisticated descriptions of reality are aiming at. And this leads back to the original theme of this thread, the sacred.

Malcolm wrote:
That which is considered inviolable is that which considered sacred: a shrine, a trust, a place, a word, bond, etc., generally because it has been blessed, but also because there may be some inherent quality which some place or thing seems to hold: such as a tree, a mountain, a spring, a river and so on., which will be ruined if it is despoiled.

The thing is, there is no adjective like "sacred" in Dharma texts (with perhaps the possible exception of brahma, i.e. brahmacarin, etc.) This, I submit, accounts for why there is so much disagreement among Western Buddhists about what is sacred and what is not, precisely because there is very little guidance on the subject from key source texts.

The manner of their existence is not the slightest bit mysterious. Buddha's silence regarded only metaphysical speculation. What is the point of positing a beginning to the world, when it is clearly taught by the Buddha that all conditioned phenomena are both causes and results? Why speculate on whether a tathaḡata exists after death, when he clearly taught than when someone attains cessation there is no longer any existence about which a nonexistence can be discussed? Each of the so called points of silence have a very clear and simple explanation, and are not a lack of explanation, rather, they are an encouragement to understand the Dharma. It is only those who do not know Dharma who believe Buddha's silences represent ambiguity on his part or some imponderable knowable only to an elect.

[1] Anyone who would say, 'Repudiating this All, I will describe another,' if questioned on what exactly might be the grounds for his statement, would be unable to explain, and furthermore, would be put to grief. Why? Because it lies beyond range."

The only meanings are those we invent. In that sense, Western naturalism pretends to be 'value-free' but it's actually 'value-negative' insofar as it denies that there can be a real basis for values beyond the utilitarian - the greatest good for the greatest number. The idea that there is something 'inherently good' is not conceivable in its terms.

Malcolm wrote:
Meanings are invented, consensual and conventional.

As for your second sentence, it is very questionable that metaphysical naturalism is necessarily grounded in utilitarianism — I think you are making too broad a claim. For example, take this definition in which there is no species of utilitarianism mentioned:
Naturalism, in recent usage, is a species of philosophical monism according to which whatever exists or happens is natural in the sense of being susceptible to explanation through methods which, although paradigmatically exemplified in the natural sciences, are continuous from domain to domain of objects and events. Hence, naturalism is polemically defined as repudiating the view that there exists or could exist any entities which lie, in principle, beyond the scope of scientific explanation.
Buddhadharma [and Jaindharma] in this respect is also a species of metaphysical naturalism — in Buddhadharma there is no mystery precisely because "whatever exists or happens is natural"  and there does not exist nor could exist "any entities which lie, in principle, beyond the scope of Dharma explanation."

In other religions however [sans philosophical Taoism and Confucism], there is a profound mystery, God, through whose agency all things are created.

Indeed, this is one of the reasons why Buddhadharma is so appealing to westerners with liberal educations. The naturalism of Buddhadharma and philosophical Taoism fit well into our already metaphysically naturalist predilections.

HH Dalai Lama exemplifies this view with his confidence that indeed science can explain confirm, and justify any and all Buddhist beliefs, but even more than that, he recommends abandoning any Buddhist tenets that are directly contradicted by scientific explanation and found to be definitely false from a scientific point of view.

Excellent comments in a generally enlightening discussion.

The problem is, as is proven again and again, ideas of the "sacred" are just consensus notions as well, and just as fungible.

For me, it follows from that that each of us has to have some sense of what is "sacred" (don't let the word itself throw you, it's just a word) in Buddhism and why. If we have no experience of that, or lose sight of it, then all we are doing is blindly applying one more set of rules instead of applying the perspective of inner cultivation which is crucial to the Buddhist path.

One of the problems in the West with the rise of Secularism is that the entire Rights framework is ungrounded when religion, and specifically, God, is removed from the equation.

Malcolm wrote:
You should read Nature's God: The Heretical Origins of the American Republic. It may cause you to revise your opinion.
Although America’s revolutionary deists lavished many sincere expressions of adoration upon their deity, deism is in fact functionally indistinguishable from what we would now call “pantheism”; and pantheism is really just a pretty word for atheism. While deism could often be associated with moderation in politics, it served principally to advance a system of thought that was revolutionary in its essence and effects. This essentially atheistic and revolutionary aspect of deism, I further contend, is central to any credible explanation of the revolutionary dimension of the American Revolution.

Queequeg said:
No, not really. The Founders were also profoundly influenced by the Roman Republic. Hamilton's ideal ruler was Julius Caesar. If you're familiar with ancient Roman civilization, especially as presented in Suetonius, Plutarch, Tacitus, etc., and then look at the early Americans, a very strong argument can be made that this is what they were modeling themselves on. For visual proof, look at Federal architecture and design; look at Washington DC. Their Deism/Pantheism looks and sounds like religion in the Roman Republic and early Roman Empire. Admittedly, it doesn't have the fervor and fanaticism of the Judeo-Christian sense, but there is still an underlying view of the world as conforming to a Natural Law; we may be looking at pantheism, but under that is a single divine order - not atheism. This guy is going too far. Admittedly I have not read any more of this article, but I don't think I need to if he thinks atheism "is central to any credible explanation of the revolutionary dimension of the American Revolution."

Malcolm wrote:
I never mentioned Bentham.

Again:
In a vital letter to John Adams, Jefferson makes clear that these Epicurean doctrines are essentially his own. “I feel therefore I exist. I feel bodies which are not myself: there are other existencies then. I call them matter,” he writes. 69 Here he quietly paraphrases Lucretius, who says, “The common sensation of all men proves the existence of matter.” Jefferson continues: “I feel them changing place. This gives me motion. Where there is an absence of matter, I call it void, or nothing, or immaterial space.” Here he is all but quoting Lucretius: “There is, then, intangible space, void, and vacuity. Otherwise, movement would be absolutely impossible.” Jefferson’s conclusion is definitive, even militant: “To talk of immaterial existences is to talk of nothings. To say that the human soul, angels, god, are immaterial is to say that they are nothings.” And here is Epicurus himself: “Those who say that the soul is incorporeal are talking nonsense.” On the sources that inspired his views, Jefferson adds, “I believe I am supported in my creed of materialism by Locke, Tracy, and Stewart.” But the manner in which he lapses into the language of Lucretius to articulate his ideas suggests that these later philosophers, whether consciously or not, served mainly as conduits for an ancient doctrine.

Still, it makes no sense to try and pin the blame on some mistaken or permissive policy the French had for these attacks. It just contributes to the rise of fascist sentiments to give into scapegoating of Muslims in general, as I know you will agree.

Nope, not even in sūtra, as the Āryabodhisattva-pitika states:
Developing sorrow for samsara is the provisional meaning;
The non-duality of samsara and nirvana is the definitive meaning.
The Hevajra Tantra states:
Having abandoned samsara for another,
nirvana will not be realized.
Samsara is form, sound and so on,
these phenomena are nirvana.

Anyone who thinks that the hundreds of thousands of refugees streaming into Europe are some sort of a covert Muslim army, needs to up the dose of their antipsychotics. Of course accepting them is the compassionate thing to do, but we should also see if we are ready to do much more - to do what it takes to successfully integrate them. This is the crux of the matter and it is no simple thing to integrate people coming from a very different culture and traumatised by the war. This is not a trivial matter and as much as progressives would like to sweep it under the carpet and the right-wing alarmists continue to whip up hysteria, there are very pragmatic considerations that need to be made, IMO.

Yes we did administer from our side of the border, but the point I am making is that everyone paints Operation Wetback something the US started. We would not have started it.

dhammafriend said:
My offering: the concept of (human) rights has it's origins in generic Christian theology.

Malcolm wrote:
Not necessarily:
Intellectual historians have tangled over the origins of rights. These debates are sometimes framed in terms of when “the concept of a right” emerged. Yet insofar as it is really the emergence of the concept of a right that is at issue, the answer lies beyond the competence of the intellectual historian and within the domain of the anthropologist. Even the most primitive social order must include rules specifying that certain individuals or groups have special permission to perform certain actions. Moreover, even the most rudimentary human communities must have rules specifying that some are entitled to tell others what they must do. Such rules ascribe rights. The genesis of the concept of a right was simultaneous with reflective awareness of such social norms.

The more productive characterization of the debate within intellectual history concerns when a word or phrase appeared that has a meaning close to the meaning of our modern word. This debate turns on when in history the pre-modern “objective” sense of “right” came also to bear our modern, “subjective” sense of “a right.”

“Right” in its older, objective sense means “what is just” or “what is fair” (Finnis 1980, 206). Aristotle uses dikaion, for example, to indicate that a society is “rightly ordered”: that it displays the correct structure of human relationships “Right” in this objective sense can also be attributed to individuals. The Roman jurist Ulpian, for instance, held that justice means rendering each his right (ius). In this sense, a person's “right” is what is due to him given his role or status. This objective sense of “right” is not the same as our modern idea of “a right.” For instance, Ulpian noted that the ius of a parricide was to be sewn into a sack of snakes and tossed into the Tiber (Tierney 1997, 16).

The scholarly inquiry into when our modern, subjective sense of “a right” became established as a meaning of some word or phrase has proved long and divisive. The ancient authors often used words imprecisely, and smeared their meanings across and beyond the Hohfeldian categories. The intellectual historians themselves have occasionally congested the discussion by taking different features of rights as definitive of the modern concept. Moreover, the scholarly debate has sometimes accepted over-optimistic assumptions about the sharpness of conceptual boundaries.

Nevertheless, two broad trends in the scholarly discussions are clear. The first is to push the origins of a term indicating a modern, subjective sense of “a right” back further into history: from Locke to Hobbes to Grotius in the seventeenth century, then to Gerson in the fifteenth century, Ockham in the fourteenth, perhaps even to Gratian in the twelfth (Brett 1997, Tierney 1997). Donohue (2010) now argues that ius is used in a subjective sense throughout the works of the classical Roman jurists in the first century BCE to the third century CE.

The second and related trend has been to establish that terms referring to active rights (what we would call privilege-rights and power-rights) predate terms referring to passive rights (what we would call claim-rights and immunity-rights). It appears that the earliest medieval debates using recognizably modern rights-language, for instance, concerned topics such as whether the pope has a (power-) right to rule an earthly empire, and whether the poor have a (privilege-) right to take what they need from the surplus of the rich.
http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rights/#3

The rest of the article is worth reading because it clarifies many things.
Why does it have to be founded on (christian) notions that various societies cannot agree on?
They are not.

dhammafriend said:
Because in reality, thats really what we do. We agitate, we lobby, we protest, we disrupt, we destroy. All with the goal of finding 'space' for ourselves and our communities. The notion that all human beings are equal (equal to what?) makes no sense if you're not from a Semitic culture. Sure Chinese, Indians and Africans can learn to speak in that way, but those notions are unintelligible in their native cultures.

I am interested in knowing what kinds of answers Buddhist texts, sutric and sastric, ancient and modern, give for reconciling the 'apparent' problem of perfect care for all beings, while abandoning conceptualisation. Discussions of meditations on compassion or wisdom in the sutras typically consider them separate, but does anyone know of sources which combine the two? Do you know of good arguments that the perfect state combining both compassion and wisdom are genuine psychological states, or are these rhetorical descriptions of the messianic mission of the Bodhisattva? Why, upon attaining the Prajnaparamita, does the Bodhisattva also have the aspiration to help other beings, rather than just abide?

If you have answers that you formulated yourself, of course those are welcome, but I am specifically looking for textual sources. The earlier the better.

No, I don't think this is correct. French immigration policies did not create this problem.

In this century, the first attack by an Islamist happened in March 2012. Then another in May, 2013. 3 in December 2014. Seven between January 2015 and now.

There are 4,155,000 Muslims and people of Muslim descent in France. I think it is a grotesque lie to claim that these attacks were caused by French Immigration policies. Most Muslims, or those of Muslim descent, in France are of either Algerian or Moroccan descent, immigrants from countries that were part of the French Empire.

It is estimated there are 1600 fighters in Isis from France. This is one out of every 2596 people of Muslim or Muslim descent in France. !8 for every one million people in France.

So, really, saying that this is a problem caused by French Immigration policies is just plain wrong.

The distinction is basically this: in cittamatra, phenomena are mental events. The way Lonchenpa explains it is like this. Bodhicitta, awakened mind, is like space, it is the basis, but it is not established in anyway. Its potential or energy [rtsal] arises like the face of a mirror. The display of that potentiality is like the eight examples of illusion. Since the basis, its potential and display are not themselves established because they are all empty, they are nondual. These three are conventionally distinguished because of appearances. Thus, bodhicitta, potentiality and the display are neither single nor plural in terms of their essence, nevertheless, just like the reflections in the mirror cannot be said to be either the same nor different than the mirror's power to reflect, it is understood that the imputations which are the display of the potential of bodhicitta also do not exist either inside or outside of, and hence these appearances are called "nonexistent, clear appearances." Indeed, nothing at all is established in anyway.

Pure spiritual traditions have to be free from politics because a spiritual life cannot be motivated by worldly concerns. Many spiritual traditions espouse meditation on death to overcome worldly concerns, and politics is worldly, so there is no place where Dharma and politics meet.

He may be naive, but he is technically correct. In this respect I am naive as well, but to a slightly lesser degree. (The Gelug emphasis on  Lam Rim that I have in common with TKF are showing here.) The way I see it "pure spiritual traditions" is almost an oxymoron. Once money, power and prestige come into play with the creation of institutions, the 8 worldly dharmas begin to intrude. One of the reasons that I'm a fan of 12 step programs is that they have made a serious attempt at defusing 6 our of the 8 worldly dharmas. By that  i mean that, according to their own bylaws, nobody is supposed to be able to make money, become famous, or pull power trips (+ or -) on anybody else. Unfortunately that leaves sex in the mix, and even Bill W. "13th stepped" a lot of women.

Wha t is not an oxymoron is a "pure spiritual practice". That is an individual thing, and it can be done in any environment. It is possible to be on retreat and have your mind filled with motivations of money, sex, power and prestige. Or you can be like HHDL who was born into power and prestige and yet is unaffected by it. So no, on the level of the individual I don't think it is overly naive, but certainly not a given either. If you don't believe me just try it. And TKF is right; that is what the meditation on death is for. Most of us usually just toss it because it reminds us of Christianity.

Malcolm wrote:
He is being naive because there is no samsara without nirvana, and no nirvana without samsara. There is no such a thing as a pure spiritual tradition that exists outside the world. The idea that spiritual traditions should eschew worldly concerns is morally bankrupt, in my opinion, it is a form of impractical utopianism. It is from his utopian stance that he took up the banner of criticizing HHDL for advocating secular ethics to begin with. He does not, and you do not here, seem to understand that it is precisely the world that we have that creates the fertile swamp in which the lotus flower of the Dharma can blossom. Secular ethics in a liberal society give those lotuses the room they need to grow, because you can be sure they will not blossom at all in a fundamentalist Hindu, Jewish, Muslim or Christian society.

Religious teachers need to promote secular ethics as well.

The obvious solution to me is that Muslim religious leaders should support the open secular society in their countries as the best way to safeguard their own freedom to worship Allah as they see fit. It is for this reason that it is vitally important that spiritual teachers and secularists come together in agreement over common secular ethics so that EVERYONE can live in harmony and at the same time practice whatever spiritual tradition they want.

Your solution is a kind of religious isolationism — fine if you're Amish, but then, the Amish are disappearing, since they are not integrated into the larger US society.

There will never be a time on this planet when all people follow the Dharma just as there has never been a time on this planet when all people followed the Dharma.

Therefore, the realistic and practical alternative to your pie in the sky utopianism is the further development of the liberal secular state based on the principle of a democratic, open society. Actually, you and the people who think like you are making a huge mistake by deriding secular ethics. Why?, because the Dharma will have its best chance to touch the lives of many people in precisely the kind of open, liberal society I am advocating.

Tsongkhapafan said:
You can argue that only those who possess the eight freedom and ten endowments have the opportunity to practise Dharma but there may be many such people who have the potential to practise but cannot at the moment because they don't have access to a centre or to a Teacher, so we should try to provide that opportunity in my view and encourage people to find real solutions to their problems.

Matt J said:
Maybe to go further, I will summarize my understanding of Mipham.

First, all we know of the external world are appearances in the mind.

Second, we infer common objects because we compare appearances with other minds. However, Mipham points out a few problems with this. First, we are using subjective impressions, which differ, to establish something that does not differ, i.e. external objects. There is a logical contradiction in using subjective impressions to prove objective objects. In addition, external objects are not appearances (they cause appearances), so they can be never known. If they can never be known, why posit it in the first place?

So instead of saying that there is a common external world, we say there are common karmic seeds.

I agree with Mipham but it doesn't seem to establish no external objects, it just makes me agnostic. Who knows what is beyond appearances? Maybe something, maybe nothing. Although, maybe this is his point--- even though he uses Chittamatra arguments, in the end he is a Madhyamika.

This is odd, but the intertwining of Buddhism with left wing liberal politics in the US seems to have something to do with the fact that it first came with Asian immigrants to our Pacific Coast. It spread into the mainstream from there alongside everything else we associate with the culture and politics of that region. This has "poisoned the well" for many when it comes to Dharma, and there are many who seek it out but ultimately give it up because of the interpretations of it they find available.

Case closed.

By the way, secular ethics are not "feel good" platitudes. Secular ethics are necessary in order to negotiate fairness and justice between different peoples of different faiths and political orientations.

Let me give you an example. A number of years ago I was attending a conference at Smith College on Mongolia. As you know, Mongolia is a country where there are a large number of people who follow the practice of Dorje Shugden. A friend of my introduced me to the Secretary General of the Mongolian Consulate to the United States, because he was quite concerned about the Dorje Shugden practice, and felt that is was a large problem in his country. After discussing various problems with the practice and its history, he asked me point blank if Mongolia shouldn't just outlaw the practice. I asked him whether or not Mongolia has a law on the books about freedom of religion, and indeed it does. I pointed out to him that in this case, a country which believes in separation of Church and State cannot be involved in banning this or that religion. You will be shocked to learn that I said to him that this kind of policy could not happen in Mongolia, that the Mongolian Gvt. would be wrong to ban Shugden practice because they value religious freedom and so forth. He was not terribly happy with my answer, but he understood it.

You see, the point is that is an instance of secular ethics, the separation of church and state are vital to everyone's freedom. A liberal open society requires a firm grounding in secular ethics for the benefit of everyone. Secular ethics are the foundation of the liberal state, they are the foundation of any open society. Thus, even though I personally think the practice of Dorje Shugden is harmful and deeply misguided, by the same token, in a liberal state, an open society, I have no choice but to accept that there are those who wish to perform this practice because of their religious beliefs.

You yourself invoked a separation of Dharma and politics. This is not a value that comes from the Dharma, this is a secular value, which finds its roots in the establishment clause of the first amendment of the US Constitution. Your and my best hope for religious freedom, economic wellbeing and justice is based precisely on the very secular ethics you are deriding. In other words, when you live in a pluralistic, diverse society like the US and Europe, one has no choice but to develop a strong and robust framework of secular ethics. It is absolutely necessary for everyone's wellbeing.

boda, I'll try to address your interest in the matter of seeming self-indulgence that isn't really in the context of the precepts.

What seems to happen seems to happen because of the afflictions of people.  I see things the way I do--things seem to me the way they seem--because of my own conditioning, karma, problems, hangups, whatever.  So I see someone take an action that may seem outrageous to me and I make certain assumptions about it, and have a certain kind of response.  Where do those assumptions come from?

For example, there's a precept against harsh speech.  OK, fine.  One day I saw a teacher I respect very much shouting instructions VERY VERY LOUDLY AND DIRECTLY AND NOT POLITELY VERY HARSHLY HOLY MOLY at a student.  It wasn't just a scolding.  The teacher really ripped him a new one.  Now, someone who witnessed this burst into tears.  Why?  Because she had grown up with an abusive father, and couldn't understand why anyone would resort to the methods of an abusive father like that.  Someone else thought it was funny and had to stifle a laugh.  And the person on the receiving end?  Just apologized meekly and went on with his life in clear repose.  That teacher clearly broke the precepts in a way that looked careless and, well, self-indulgent.  It would have been harder to simply pull the student aside and have the "Hey now, we need to talk" conversation.  Instead he just popped off and made an example out of the poor sap.

We later found out that the whole thing was a pre-arranged stunt to teach someone else a completely different lesson.  It was Dharma theater, and it worked like a charm to break that third party of a pernicious habit.  Now, was the response of the person who started crying true or false?  Did the teacher really break the precept?

Funny -- I was just reading a https://bhikkhucintita.wordpress.com/home/blog/ by Bhikkhu CIntita, a Theravadin monk, on the topic of ethics. He writes:
The weaknesses of precepts as guides to ethical conduct are that they...don’t permit appropriate exceptions, that is, precepts are porous and rigid.  There is the case in which the Gestapo shows up at our front door and asks us, gleefully aware that a Buddhist will not lie, if we are hiding Jews in the attic, or that in which one of us just happens to be returning from a softball game with a  bat in his hand and walk in right behind a man who has just “gone postal” and is about to embark on taking out fellow employees. There are, moreover, many harmful, generally mildly harmful, behaviors that simply are not covered in precepts, like taking up two parking spaces.

Nonetheless, it is significant that the Buddha rarely sanctioned exceptions to precepts to correct their rigidity. I suspect this is because he wanted us to be fully aware of, and live with, the contradictory nature of the human condition rather than regulating it away.
How do you think a good Buddhist should behave in the kinds of situations he mentions?

Malcolm wrote:
It is pretty obvious — you lie to the Gestapo and strike down the man who is killing others with the bat. This is proper Buddhist response. Any other response is irresponsible.

That's a somewhat Nyingma type perspective. Most Nyingma lamas are not monks. The more monastic sects of Vajrayana do not necessarily agree. HHK 16 was a monk that kept his vows. He was not "weak-minded".

SMCJ, he was an ārya on the stages, or so many people believe.  Such people are simply incapable of breaking their vows at all, so how can they "keep" them? What they do is represent the principle of holding vows, but in reality their conduct is beyond holding vows.

The teachings say therefore that we should avoid one-sided attitudes regarding the view and action. Like eagles soaring in space, we should be clearly convinced of the view, but at the same time we should heed the karmic principle of cause and effect, as finely as if we were sifting flour.
As Buddhists, we rely on the teachings of the Buddha, and must therefore have heartfelt confidence in the supreme Dharma. Whoever we are, we need to have a good heart, sincere and without deceit. At all times and on all occasions, we must maintain an irreversible trust in the sacred Dharma, and our minds must be steady and constant. These three things are our firm foundation: steady faith, sincere devotion, and constancy. Furthermore, whatever the Dharma contains, it is all Buddha’s teaching. We must therefore have pure perception and an appreciation of all Dharma traditions, those of others as much as our own. We must respect them all.

Well, four of the five lay precepts are just based on all three physical non-virtues and one of the nonvirtues of speech. If you need a vow not to kill things, engage in inappropriate sexual conduct, steal and lie that does not say very much for your moral character, does it?

BrianG said:
But morality, if you define it as training in, engaging in wholesome actions, and abstaining from unwholesome ones, does require precepts.  At least according to my interpretation of Sakya Pandita's Distinguishing The Three Vows.

Malcolm wrote:
If you subscribe to an excessively legalistic frame of mind, i.e., the one characterized by late Indian and 13th--15th century Tibetan thinking about the three vows, perhaps. According to their argument taking a vow of not killing makes both your practice of not killing and the act of killing stronger. There is some truth to this, but only in the sense that a vow indicates a strong resolve.

So, if you are already have a strong resolve not to take life, for what reason do you need a vow not to do so? Please recall, there was no Vinaya in the beginning, the first five monks had no vows per se. The Vinaya gradually grew slowly as Buddha tried to deal with misbehaving monks causing problems.

The fact is that all three vows are scholastic constructions.

The three vows can also summarized into three principles: cause no harm; help sentient beings; cultivate pure vision. If one is following these three principles, then you are training śila.

Otherwise, a monk with all 251 vows can be a very harmful person, refuse to help sentient beings, and have completely impure vision, and nevertheless keep their 251 vows perfectly —— is this really training in śila? Of course not.

On the other hand a lay person who has gone for refuge but feels they cannot follow the five precepts, such a person can actually practice ahimsa, help sentient beings and cultivate pure vision. Such a person I would say is actually training in śila.

Sexual misconduct is more deception, against others, and against your inhibitions.

Malcolm wrote:
No, not at all. First of all, these "inhibitions" are largely cultural, which is why they vary so much from one culture to another. Secondly, sexual misconduct is clearly defined as sexual activity which is exploitative, such sex with minors and the ill; sexual acts which damage social contracts, such as marriage; and sexual acts which are seen as inappropriate or indolent, such as sex in shrines or during the day; and sexual acts which are seen as physically unhealthy, such as oral and anal sex. It is a physical act that is being censured.

Which brings us to intoxication, with substances, with ideas, worldly activities, plans. Shameless intoxication that precludes mindfulness.

I'm wondering how this works on an interpersonal level. I mean, yes, ultimately it's all concepts and fabrications, but practically speaking there are other people and it seems important to interact on a human level. How do we cultivate the "mind-only" perspective while not losing sight of other people's needs, concerns, presence and humanity?

Malcolm wrote:
Mind-only refers only to the container universe, including bodies; it does not mean that other's minds are only your mind. Relatively speaking, i.e. false relative truth, there are still outer appearances, etc. True relative truth is that all these external appearances are just activated traces in the mind. Ultimate truth is that even mind is not established as truly existent and real.

It is interesting to read books about pre-invasion Tibet, like wayfarers describing their journey.
A part of Alexandra David-Neil's book where she depicted the life of the "slaves" in Tibet was censured in the second edition. I'm reading a book written by a kashmiri merchant who was astonished by the prescribed tortures for the robbers (lost head nails in the fingers).
The difference between then and now (in the East and the West), it's "religious" practise, which became "religiosity".

Malcolm wrote:
It is important to understand that in old Tibet there were no real laws per se that governed the behavior of people outside of Lhasa. There were very few courts, and aristocrats had a very free hand to dispense punishments pretty much as they saw fit. Those punishments were often cruel by modern standards, but certainly not by seventeenth and eighteenth century standards. Tibet was largely governed by custom and local councils.

Banditry was a family business in much of Eastern Tibet, right up through the 1950's. Paltrul Rinpoche's brother in fact was one of the most famous bandits in Tibetan history.

Tibet was not a Shangri-lha, but it was also not the medieval hell some leftist writers have tried to make out. It was like anywhere else humans have lived. People like to think that because the Tibetans preserved the Dharma it is a "nicer" place — but I think they would be in for a rude surprise. We mainly know Tibet from the point of view of an educated elite. We have very little knowledge of the subaltern Tibet, the Tibet of illiterate farmers, wives, merchants, hunters, soldiers, prostitutes, criminals and bandits. The fact that our main window into old Tibet is through the window of the elite skews our view quite a bit.

Tibetan aristocrats did whatever they wanted to poor people with no remedy. This is a fact. I have had long conversations about this with Tibetan Lamas raised in Tibet.

Great post, Dzoki, by the way....and if it matters, I will say that I had a very intimate conversation with a Lama who echoed the feeling regarding ethics lacking in Western Vajrayana culture, and feeling that the only complete and successful transplantation of Vajrayana to the West will occur when Ethical traning becomes the foundation.  Not necessarily "Monasticism," mind you.....

One of the problems in the West with the rise of Secularism is that the entire Rights framework is ungrounded when religion, and specifically, God, is removed from the equation. The idea of Rights comes from a variety of sources including in no small part, Natural Law which has been understood as God's Law.

Malcolm wrote:
You should read Nature's God: The Heretical Origins of the American Republic. It may cause you to revise your opinion.
...the most popular narrative concerning the very idea of America— one that unites Christian nationalists with a large number of sober historians— has it that the American Republic owes its independence and its individual freedoms to its Protestant Christian legacy. 86 This narrative often comes with a distinguished lineage that traces the ideas of individual rights and freedom of conscience to seminal Protestant thinkers such as John Milton (1608– 1674), and it characteristically represents Jefferson, Madison, and precursors like Locke as latitudinarian Protestants or (to use a label that at the time would have sounded like a gross oxymoron) “Christian Deists.” 87 But this gets the history of ideas almost exactly wrong. It is to confuse mere precedence in time with causality. It is to suppose, falsely, that the ideas that best explain the actions of a collective are those that a majority of people within it pretend to carry around in their heads. Reformed religion brought carnage to Britain and Germany in the seventeenth century and madness to America in the eighteenth because it was a symptom of modernity, not a cause— a pathology, not a theory.

And:
For the further clarification of the meaning of this “Religion of Nature’s God,” he referred his readers to “[ Alexander] Pope’s little Essay on Man, confessedly deduced from the inspiration of Lord Bolingbroke, and perhaps every sentence adopted by me.” In some alternate universe— such as perhaps the one constructed from the nationalist myths that have long gripped American historiography— Young’s peculiar “Religion of Nature’s God” might have amounted to little more than a historical oddity. It was just the cloudy reflection of a disturbing individual who was always fishing in troubled waters. To judge from the hate that filled the newspapers of the time, it was a quite unpopular form of belief, deeply at odds with all the accepted varieties of the Christian religion. Yet the curious fact is that Young, like Allen, manifestly saw his unusual religion as an intimate component of the revolutionary political struggle in which he was engaged. The rights he claimed on behalf of his countrymen against the British Parliament and even against the Crown itself were not the rights guaranteed to Englishmen by their constitution, nor the rights due to Christians, but the rights deriving from the laws of nature and of “Nature’s God.” And Young and Allen were far from alone in their revolutionary theology. Indeed, “Nature’s God” was the presiding deity of the American Revolution. Franklin invoked it in his newspaper articles as early as 1747.
Stewart, Matthew (2014-07-01). Nature's God: The Heretical Origins of the American Republic (p. 138). W. W. Norton & Company. Kindle Edition.


And:
In most versions of America’s revolutionary history, the term “deism,” if it appears at all, is taken to refer to a superficial theological doctrine about a “watchmaker God” who fashions a world of mechanical wonders and then walks away to the sound of ticking noises. Deism, according to this line of interpretation, was just a watery expression of the Christian religion, adulterated somewhat with the platitudes of the Enlightenment. It was the opposite of atheism, as the dictionary tells us, and it should count as thumpingly religious by modern standards. It arose in Britain around the turn of the eighteenth century and arrived in America in a moderate and conciliatory mood, quite different from the atheistic Enlightenment that took hold in France and elsewhere. The informed consensus today further supposes that deism was a detachable doctrine, present to some degree among the educated elites in revolutionary America, but only incidentally connected with the political ideology of its revolutionaries. All of this, I now think, is not quite right. “Deism” in its own day referred not to a superficial theological doctrine but to a comprehensive intellectual tradition that ranged freely across the terrain we now associate with ethics, political theory, metaphysics, the philosophy of mind, and epistemology. It was an astonishingly coherent and systematic body of thought, closer to a way of being than any particular dogma, and it retained its essential elements over a span of centuries, not decades. In origin and substance, deism was neither British nor Christian, as the conventional view supposes, but largely ancient, pagan, and continental, and it spread in America far beyond the educated elite. Although America’s revolutionary deists lavished many sincere expressions of adoration upon their deity, deism is in fact functionally indistinguishable from what we would now call “pantheism”; and pantheism is really just a pretty word for atheism. While deism could often be associated with moderation in politics, it served principally to advance a system of thought that was revolutionary in its essence and effects. This essentially atheistic and revolutionary aspect of deism, I further contend, is central to any credible explanation of the revolutionary dimension of the American Revolution.

Again, I'm just wondering what is the intersection between these ideas of historicity, and how they actually inform one's view as a Dharma practitioner.

Malcolm wrote:
It is useful to use these concepts:

Myth: a traditional story, especially one concerning the early history of a people or explaining some natural or social phenomenon, and typically involving supernatural beings or events.

Legend: a traditional story sometimes popularly regarded as historical but unauthenticated

Fable: a short story, typically with animals as characters, conveying a moral.

Chronicle: a factual written account of important or historical events in the order of their occurrence.

History: the study of past events, particularly in human affairs:

For example, sūtras mostly fit the bill as legend. However, there are a number of texts in Hināyāna and Mahāyana that can only be described as myths. The tantras, for the most part are myths, but some, especially lower tantras, more in line with legends. Dzogchen tantras are entirely within the realm of myth.

The Jatakas are clearly fables in the modern sense of the term.

The premodern "histories" we encounter are more properly considered chronicles.

Prior to the 20th century, really, there was no Buddhist history. Buddhist history is an entirely modern thing. True, these other terms I am using are also modern categories, but I think they are useful ways of approaching the different kinds of texts in the Buddhist tradition. For example, as practitioners, we are mostly inspired by the myths, legends and chronicles which form context for our practice. We are not so much concerned [to greater and lesser extents] with history in the modern sense of the term.

a system of government in which most of the important decisions are made by state officials rather than by elected representatives.

The so-called liberal society is the only means of finding a common ground in a pluralistic world and ensuring everyone is treated with fairness.

Asian cultures have more fear from corporatization, as their social history has programmed Asians into sublimating their egos into the group.

One of the great legacies of the First Nations in North America to European settlers who eventually exterminated them by and large, is our American sense of individualism and personal freedom— because that certainly did not come from the European experience.

Modern corporatization is just an extension of European Colonialism. There will always be dissenters from it here in the US. But not in Asia, it fits in with the Asian mentality too well.

As an outsider, it is important that I am aware of my own penchant to impute/inflict concepts and so on onto Tibetans they just don't share with Anglo-American culture.

This is one of the reasons I am so opposed to using language in translations that is saturated with native meaning for English speakers that does not reflect implications of a given term in the source language — in this case Tibetan. I gave an example, i.e. translating the Tibetan term gzhi, basis, as "ground of being", a theological term largely coined by the Catholic Theologian, Paul Tillich that has no meaning nor corollary in Buddhist discourse.

When I say 'accomodate', what I mean is that a secular-scientific worldview doesn't have any categories in terms of which such a statement can be understood or explained. From the scientific-secular point of view, it is off the map, it is radically diferent to anything that can be accounted for in terms of the physical sciences or evolutionary biology.

In liberalism, there is an inbuilt 'respect for freedom of conscience' - that is basic to liberalism, and it's a good thing. However one of the consequences is that such ideas are accomodated as 'individual or social beliefs'. So Nirvāṇa is no longer a or the fundamental reality of existence - it's 'a belief'. People or groups are allowed to have such beliefs, but they're essentially either private, or socially-mediated, because they can't be accounted for in scientific terms. Hence that tends towards relativism, the idea that ultimately it is just a matter of belief, or to all intents, an opinion, and doesn't concern anything real.

Now maybe where that is changing is in the various attempts at cross-cultural dialogue, and there's some good things happening there. So it's not all doom and gloom. But for us living in the west, we need to be very aware of the background, lurking normativity of the 'scientific secular' worldview, as the 'arbiter of what is real'.

What you are saying is obviously wrong. Religion is not at all necessary for moral and ethical action. It is not at all necessary for "moral possibility."

All religions illustrate two essential possibilities for the future, typically either heaven vs hell, or entrapment vs liberation, or a combination. The moral decisions one makes plays a causative role in determining that future. But secular culture either makes no claims to the future, or settles for oblivion. Therefore, for the non-religious, moral actions in this life can play no part in determining that future. The future you experience (or don't) is unrelated to the moral decisions you make. Morality becomes indeterminate. Amorality.

One, not all religions make this claim; for example, Judaism has no concept of an afterlife or liberation. Neither do Confucism or Taoism. Would you accuse these faiths of lacking a coherent, robust ethical systems? I think not. In fact, the Purva Mimasa too do not believe in rebirth or liberation.

Therefore, your premise is stillborn.

A concept of an afterlife and a concept of liberation are not necessary for the construction of a coherent, robust and comprehensive system of morals and ethics.

For the nonreligious, the pursuit of an ethical life becomes an end in itself. Quite frankly, given the colonization and globalization that has destroyed the environment of the world and has lead to impoverishment of billions for the benefit of a few million, the ethics of the religious have not proven to a boon to humanity. There is very little correlation between a person's supposed religiosity and their ethical behavior. In fact, religion is used time and again for perpetrating highly immoral and unethical actions. The notion that religious thinking a priori results in moral and ethical action is ludicrous.

How is the Dharma transmitted in the absence of social institutions committed to the systematic practice and transmission of Dharma?

Malcolm wrote:
The amazing thing is that Dharma continues to be transmitted despite institutions. There is no Dharma in institutions, there is only Dharma in people, and frankly — most people in Buddhist institutions are not very interested in Dharma.

Kunzang said:
Dzogchen Community is an institution. Do you feel this way about your vajra sibs too?

Malcolm wrote:
No, it really isn't, not in the way most people think about Dharma institutions [no monks, no monasteries, etc.]. There are some buildings, it is true. Who knows what will happen to those.

So what does "lha" as in "lha chos" mean Malcolm? And is this a collective term in Tibetan that would refer to the "specialness" (for want of a better word) of stupas of stupas relics, temples etc or is there another word?

(Interesting topic Tingzin)

Malcolm wrote:
The original meaning of Lha in Tibetan is "royal." Originally Dharma was the " chos " of the Tibetan Kings [ chos is derived from a root which means to "rectify, repair." Lha also means "high." It also means a god. It has associations with high status.

With regard to your last comment, "sacred outlook" does not work for dag snang. You do not need to consecrate anything to have dag snang. Dag snang is self-arising. You cannot fabricate dag snang.

Well, maybe, but as you like to point out, language is diachronic. I don't see why you can't repurpose 'sacred' in order to refer to a kind of natural or self-arising sacredness/purity or whatever.

Malcolm wrote:
You can, I won't. I like to keep terms with other religious as well as philosophical connotations out of Dharma discourse as much as possible. Its one of the reasons I object to the term "ground of being" so vehemently as a translation of gzhi.
