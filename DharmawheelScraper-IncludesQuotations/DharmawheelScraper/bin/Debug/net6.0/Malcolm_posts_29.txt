How to Spot the Reptilians Running the U.S. Government:

Unknown said:
As 12 million Americans "know," the United States government is run by lizard people (or, to be scientifically accurate, reptilians). But they never said which members of the government are the reptilians. So we're here to help.

Piecing together the latest groundbreaking research being conducted by commenters at conspiracy websites, we've been able to isolate a number of prominent individuals who possess reptilian-compatible bloodlines. As "ufochick" writes at DavidIcke.com (Icke is a prominent reptile theorist, as evidenced by his book at right), even if a person has compatible bloodlines, "they will not become a reptilian unless a reptilian entity inhabits their physical body."

Redeeming the 'Strawman'
While many sovereign citizens own guns, their weapon of choice is paper. A simple traffic violation or pet-licensing case can end up provoking dozens of court filings containing hundreds of pages of pseudo-legal nonsense. For example, Donna Lee Wray, Jerry Kane's "common-law wife," was recently involved in a protracted legal battle in a dog-licensing case. She filed 10 sovereign documents in court over a two-month period, then declared victory when the harried prosecutor decided to drop the case. A three-year dog license in Wray's Pinellas County, Fla., costs $20.

It isn't just the number of pages that is causing courts to sag under the weight of these filings. The documents are written in a kind of special sovereign code language that judges, lawyers and other court staff simply don't speak. Sovereigns believe that if they can find just the right combination of words, punctuation, paper, ink color and timing, they can have anything they want — freedom from taxes, unlimited wealth, and life without licenses, fees or laws, are all just a few strangely worded documents away. It's the modern-day equivalent of "abracadabra."

Ryan Lenz, a senior investigative reporter for the Southern Poverty Law Center, has been researching them for nearly eight years. It’s been a terrifying eight years. A 2011 splc report pegged the number of the sovereign citizens, a mix of hard-core believers and sympathizers, at 300,000. The movement, Lenz believes, has grown significantly since then.

Whether or not they would describe themselves as alt-right, Hawley argues, they share the movement’s belief in a politics that promotes white interests above those of other racial groups.

If Hawley is right, then the alt-right’s constituency isn’t a tiny fringe. It’s about 11 million Americans.

Queequeg said:
In the real world, since the end of the Vietnam era, the overwhelming majority of serious political violence—not counting vandalism or punches thrown at protests, but violence with lethal intent—has come from the fringes of the right. Heidi Beirich, director of the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Intelligence Project says that “if you go back to the 1960s, you see all kinds of left-wing terrorism, but since then it’s been exceedingly rare.” She notes that eco- and animal-rights extremists caused extensive property damage in the 1990s, but didn’t target people.

Meanwhile, says Beirich, “right-wing domestic terrorism has been common throughout that period, going back to groups like to The Order, which assassinated [liberal talk-radio host] Alan Berg [in 1984] right through to today.” Mark Pitcavage, a senior research fellow at the Anti-Defamation League’s Center on Extremism, told NPR that “when you look at murders committed by domestic extremists in the United States of all types, right-wing extremists are responsible for about 74 percent of those murders.”

Bill Waldron's book, The Buddhist Unconscious, shows in detail the doctrinal requirements that resulted in the development of the Alaya-Vijñāna or 'storehouse consciousness'. I don't think you need to reify it as any kind of entity or over-arching 'one mind', if that is the concern. But I don't think it's feasible to deny that there is such a concept, either.

Malcolm wrote:
You are not really understanding the intent of the doctrine. The idea is that appearances of the universe are a result of karmavipaka. How does that karmavipaka ripen? The Yogacāra school theorized a process called cittasaṃtanaparinama, the transformation of the mind stream. This comes about because it is held that when we engage in an action, this creates an impression, called a vāsanā, literally, "perfume," in Tibetan, bag chags. This is also called a bija or seed. These seeds are held to be stored in a consciousness called the ālayavijñāna, which upon the elimination of all the seeds then vanishes. An impression or seed, when it meets its special condition for transformation of ripening, then gives rise to an appearance that corresponds to the action which produced it.

Asanga argues that this ālayavijñāna is the same thing as the Theravada bhavanga, or linking consciousness. On the other hand, the ālaya does not have objects it does not operate through the senses. It is the object, however, of the kliṣṭamanas, the afflicted mind. The other senses consciousnesses are products of the ripening of these seeds which create the appearances of outer objects such as the universe and so on.

So, it really does not, in the Yogacāra theory, function like an unconscious mind.


Wayfarer said:
And I think as a practical matter, any Buddhist has to acknowledge that there are 'latent tendencies' which are not always fully conscious but which manifest (or 'come to fruition') in response to circumstances or stimuli (I know I certainly do). I find it a bit hard to understand why those wouldn't be understood in terms of being un- or sub-conscious tendencies.

Malcolm wrote:
But here we are talking about memory. Memories are active concepts of the seven consciousnesses. This is basic to all Buddhist thinking on the issue. The question concerned whether Buddhism acknowledged what we term unconscious mental processes. It doesn't. The distinction made in Buddhism is a distinction between nonconceptual and conceptual cognitive processes: for example direct perceptions on the one hand, and the identification of direct perceptions as objects on the other. We are not necessarily aware, in a conscious sense, of all that we directly perceive because direct perceptions are by nature nonconceptual, and to be conscious of a given thing requires us to have a concept about it. In other words, the first moment of cognition is nonconceptual; in the second moment, mental factors such as perception jump in and allow us to discriminate the blue object we are having a direct perception of as a blue cup. When we have direct perceptions of unfamiliar entities, we struggle to discriminate them, and often, we do not bother to discriminate them at all. But we cannot become conscious of a given thing of which we have not had a direct perception-- this does not bar us from having an imagination, but in reality our abstract imagination is predicated on bits and pieces of newly arranged direct perceptions. The Buddhist theory of cognition, as has been noted, is in general a) nominalist and b) resembles, somewhat, Hume's pov in the Inquiry into Human Understanding. The outlier is Yogacāra, which bears some similarities to Berkely's thought.

In general, what Buddhism considers latent are afflictions (kleṣa), termed in their latent form, anuśaya. There are 6 basic anuśaya: attachment, anger, pride, ignorance, false views, and doubt. These anuśayas are not subconscious tendencies. These six then gets further divided into a total of 98. If you want to know more about them, their number and so on, consult chapter 5 of the Koshabhasyam.

Karma can never be latent, why? Because karma is caused by afflictions. According to Madhyamaka, a karma continues without ceasing until it meets its condition for ripening; according to Yogacāra, a karma makes an impression, then ceases; and when that impression meets it special condition for ripening, it does.

If you want to understand in more detail how this all works in Yogacāra, one should consult the Mahāyāna Samgraha.

This may be because the semantic field of the Buddhadharma ideas of memory/recollection predate and never later accommodated a model of data storage based on writing things down on paper.

Basically, they both define the mechanism of memory as being free from mental distractions. The more undistracted one is, that is free from affliction one is, the better one's memory will become. But there is no definition of memory having some matrix, or memories existing in some latent form. Memories are simply knowing some familiar entity that one experienced in the past. This also explains why we do not remember and will never remember most of what we experience on a day to day basis. Most of what we experience is either too trivial to recall or it is an object with which we have no repeated familiarity.

Grigoris said:
I do not think that neuroscience will be able to adequately explain memory, mainly because neuroscience deals with brain and not mind.  I believe that the explanation found in Buddhism based on the idea of the alaya-vijnana, or of samskara (as habits based on past volitional actions) is more fitting.

Malcolm wrote:
That explanation which you seek does not exist in Buddhist texts. You are fabricating it. If you examine Abhidharma, Madhyamaka, Yogācara, etc., you will never find the definition of memory presented in the terms you describe. One does not even see memory described in terms of bag chags.

Although there was no explicit concept of unconscious mind in early Buddhism (roughly 5th-2nd centuries BCE), there was an awareness of processes that later Buddhists, like many modern scholars, would consider descriptively unconscious. These included not only the various cognitive processes that subserve all ordinary perception, but also our ongoing emotional dispositions and sense of self-identity.

Wayfarer said:
Also, I would have thought that the fact that yogis are able to suspend their respiration and other metabolic processes, in a way which the untrained can definitely not do, arises from their awareness of and mastery over autonomic and semi-autonomic functions, which for most people are unconscious.

William Waldron has a book, The Buddhist Unconscious: The Alaya-vijñana in the context of Indian Buddhist Thought:
This is the story of fifth century CE India, when the Yogacara tested the awareness of unawareness, and became aware of human unawareness to an extraordinary degree. They not only explicitly differentiated this dimension of mental processes from conscious cognitive processes, but also offered reasoned arguments on behalf of this dimension of mind. This is the concept of the 'Buddhist unconscious', which arose just as philosophical discourse in other circles was fiercely debating the limits of conscious awareness, and these ideas in turn had developed as a systematisation of teachings from the Buddha himself.

Malcolm wrote:
The ālayavijñāna is not actually a separate consciousness. It is a name for consciousness in its role as a repository of traces, vasanas (a theory of the Yogacārins the Madhyamaka find very faulty).

In the Yogacāra system, the ālayavijñāna does not perform any cognitive function at all, not even as an unconscious. In the Yogacāra presentation, it is basically inert, which is why Madhyamakas tend to reject their presentation.

Where can I learn more about this Buddha "Powerful Heroic Youth" (Gzhon nu Dpa' bo stobs ldan) - which I'm guessing is Shyönnu Pawo Tobden, sixth of the 12 founding Dzogchen masters? Are there any literatures that explain more about this Buddha and his nirmanakaya field?

David Brooks' current https://nyti.ms/2R7Chgh:
the Democratic campaign is inadequate to the current moment. It offers no counter-narrative to Trump, little moral case against his behavior, no unifying argument against ethnic nationalism. In politics you can’t beat something with nothing. Democrats missed the Trumpian upsurge because while society was dividing into cultural tribes, they spent 2008 through 2016 focusing on health care. Now that the upsurge has happened, they are still pinioned to health care.
...

It has now become evident that Republicans are better at politicizing cultural issues and Democrats are better at offering economic benefits to those who are struggling. If you think voting behavior is primarily motivated by material appeals, the Democratic strategy is fine. But if you think it’s motivated by cultural identity, a desire for respect, a sense of what’s right, loyalty to a common story, the Democratic strategy leaves a lot to be desired.

Bristollad said:
And that’s what I don’t get about American attitudes to health care, that you think it’s all about economics.  The National Health Service in the UK was instituted after the Second World War because of a sense of what’s right, a desire for respect for those who had served and suffered, because people were motivated by the desire to change the status quo and not simply return to how things were before.  It’s become a treasured part of our cultural identity that even Mrs Thatcher dared not privatise.

“The astonishing fact is that Bevan’s vision has stood both the test of time and the test of change unimaginable in his day. At the centre of his vision was a National Health Service, and sixty years on, his NHS – by surviving, growing and adapting to technological and demographic change – remains at the centre of the life of our nation as a uniquely British creation, and still a uniquely powerful engine of social justice.”  Gordon Brown talking about Nye Bevan who was the Health Minister in 1948 when the NHS started.

The texts that refer to the tiger/tigress as a yum all seem to post-date Taksham's revelations. I can find no evidence of this in any bio of Padmasambhava, Yeshe Tosgyal, or any terma cycle that dates earlier than Taksham's bio of Tsogyal.

The collection of eight manifestations sadhana in the Northern Treasures states:

stag mo drud ma'i gdan la bzhugs. The verb "'drud pa" means to carry, so probably pregnant, as in "carrying" cubs. No mention of being a yum.

The earliest independent sadhana I know of is in the Drigung Yangzab, which again has no mention of a tigress as a yum. Yangzab was revealed in the first half of the 16th century.

Could ChNN have encountered Ati Muwer as a Zhang Zhung Tibetan being to which Bonpos then ascribed one set of characterisitics, and Buddhists another? I'm also wondering if there were perhaps two totally different figures of that name in Zhang Zhung.

Malcolm wrote:
It basically boils down to the difference between the Buddhist, and largely western academic view, that the Bon of the time of the imperial period, 800 and before was a completely different religion from the Bon that emerged during the 10th and eleventh century under the influence of Buddhism. This is also Chogyal Namkhai Norbu's point view. From this perspective then, the Ati Mu wer that we see pictured in the Gekhod cycle is a later innovation, only nominally related to the A ti mu wer who was an important protective deity of Zhang Zhung.

That fact that Buddhists do not accept Bonpo accounts of history in general is always going to be a sore spot between Buddhism and Bon. As far as the majority of Buddhists are concerned, modern Bon is basically an imitation of Buddhism. However, in many Bonpo ritual texts, and even some kinds of ritual texts preserved by Buddhists, such as lha bsang offerings and so on, we can see evidence of the real pre-Buddhist religion of Tibet. Most of the Buddhist worldly protectors are originally pre-Buddhist local deities, btsan, rgyalpos, and so on.

Bonpos, naturally, will be unhappy with these opinions.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes,in his Drollo ter cycle, the medium length sadhana refers to the tigress as the sbyor yum, "the consort for union," who is a passionate (ngar ma) bengal tigress (rgya stag). In another place, a long praise, the tigress is referred to as the "sgrol yum," the consort for liberation" who is a brilliant red, wrathful tigress. In the Kha thang literature, the union consort is generally understood to be Tsogyal, the liberation consort is generally understood to be Tashi Kyidren. In yet another place, the mount is a red and black terrifying bengal tigress with iron claws.

Overall however, the liberation consort is generally identified as Ekajati, and as in the Bio of Tsogyal, Tsogyal is identified as Ekajati, while the tigress is Kyidron. However, as I specified before, this identification arrives in a terma of the later period, and it seems that it spread widely, since Taksham's bio of Tsogyal paints a far more comprehensive lifestory of Tsogyal than other, earlier bios which make no mention of this episode at Paro Taksang.

You don't have to believe it, but this the tradition I received from my teacher. Likewise, you received a tradition that Tonpa Shenrab lived 18,000 years ago— something which I don't believe at all. Since Bonpos have nothing to do with Guru Rinpoche anyway, I find it difficult to understand your interest in this thread. Guru Rinpoche defeated the Bonpos, as did Milarepa, and so on. If you take a western text critical view of these things, you will find that equally harmful to Cḧo and Bon, actually, more harmful to Bon-- because the western scholarly consensus is that modern Bon is just a form of Buddhism that arose in the 11th century, around the same time as the treasure tradition.

The source of this idea of mine is the late Yeshe Phunstog, an American who was a very close disciple of Dudjom Rinpoche, and Gyatrul Rinpoche's right hand man for many years. His main practice was Dudjom Drollo. He informed me of this on the occasion Ngakpa Yeshe Dorje's bestowal of the Dudjom Drollo in Boston, Ma., 1992, when asked, Ngakpa Rinpoche confirmed this. "Gro bo lod" is a corruption of krodhalokottāra, which is why the main sadhana of Dorje Drollo in the DT begins with "Namo mahāguru vajra krodhalokottāraye."

Malcolm wrote:
I guess you don't really get the gist of Hayek's argument, so I will reproduce it here for your edification:

Nemo said:
The dispute between the modern planners and their opponents is, therefore, not a dispute on whether we ought to choose intelligently between the various possible organizations of society; it is not a dispute on whether we ought to employ foresight and systematic thinking in planning our common affairs. It is a dispute about what is the best way of so doing. The question is whether for this purpose it is better that the holder of coercive power should confine himself in general to creating conditions under which the knowledge and initiative of individuals are given the best scope so that they can plan most successfully; or whether a rational utilization of our resources requires central direction and organization of all our activities according to some consciously constructed “blueprint.”

Nemo said:
Road to Serfdom was reactionary to the Commies of his day trying to do top down state capitalism and calling it communism.  Even Hayek would admit it was his worst and most ideological work. Keynes is the one who economics proved was right.

Malcolm wrote:
Keynes was quite fond of Road to Serfdom, in fact, and praised it when it was published, despite the fact that the two were often at loggerheads. Keynes even wrote to Hayke in 1944:

Nemo said:
“morally and philosophically I find myself in agreement with virtually the whole of it; and not only in agreement with it, but in a deeply moved agreement.”

Malcolm wrote:
Hayek, F. A.. The Road to Serfdom: Text and Documents--The Definitive Edition: Text and Documents--The Definitive Edition (The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek, Volume 2) (pp. 23-24). University of Chicago Press. Kindle Edition.

Road to Serfdom does little in the way of offering proposals and solutions. Indeed, one of the main criticism is of the book is that it primarily focused on right and left-wing collectivism in general.

With respect to things like universal health care, free education, and so on -- these things are not within the purview of what Hayek is defining as "central planning" or "collectivism."

So again, for those who are willing to be seduced by the term "socialism," I think a review of Hayek's little book is important. Reading it does not necessarily entail subscribing to Van Mises' Austrian School of Economics and so on. But Road to Serfdom certainly points out the deficiencies of centralized planning of whole economies:

Nemo said:
We must centrally direct economic activity if we want to make the distribution of income conform to current ideas of social justice. “Planning,” therefore, is wanted by all those who demand that “production for use” be substituted for production for profit. But such planning is no less indispensable if the distribution of incomes is to be regulated in a way which to us appears to be the opposite of just. Whether we should wish that more of the good things of this world should go to some racial élite, the Nordic men, or the members of a party or an aristocracy, the methods which we shall have to employ are the same as those which could insure an equalitarian distribution.

Malcolm wrote:
Hayek, F. A.. The Road to Serfdom: Text and Documents--The Definitive Edition: Text and Documents--The Definitive Edition (The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek, Volume 2) (p. 84). University of Chicago Press. Kindle Edition.

This is the consequence of centralized planning of economies:

Nemo said:
It is the price of democracy that the possibilities of conscious control are restricted to the fields where true agreement exists and that in some fields things must be left to chance. But in a society which for its functioning depends on central planning this control cannot be made dependent on a majority’s being able to agree; it will often be necessary that the will of a small minority be imposed upon the people, because this minority will be the largest group able to agree among themselves on the question at issue. Democratic government has worked successfully where, and so long as, the functions of government were, by a widely accepted creed, restricted to fields where agreement among a majority could be achieved by free discussion; and it is the great merit of the liberal creed that it reduced the range of subjects on which agreement was necessary to one on which it was likely to exist in a society of free men. It is now often said that democracy will not tolerate “capitalism.” If “capitalism” means here a competitive system based on free disposal over private property, it is far more important to realize that only within this system is democracy possible. When it becomes dominated by a collectivist creed, democracy will inevitably destroy itself.

I frankly see no compelling arguments that negate Hayek's basic thesis here, despite whatever faults his other work may bear.

This comes to another point - The US has to become confident in our way of doing things again, because that is what motivates us to help other countries develop in our mold. US influence in Latin America is a mess and the US has historically not done right in the region. There is, however, plenty of potential to do it right. That path is a whole discussion itself. One thing, to make that happen, Latin Americans have to stop this tendency to nationalize industries. Nothing turns off investment like the looming threat that everything can just be seized by fiat.

You may have inadvertently chosen the wrong words there.  The world absolutely does not need other countries developing in the mold of the US.

Queequeg said:
I guess my response is two fold.

The shortcomings are there. You're position seems to ignore all the things that are going right.

Start with the rule of law. There is no way we would have a country this big, this diverse, functioning this well if the rule of law was not as robust as it is. This not only includes enforcement of property and contract rights, the fair and peaceful resolution of disputes, peaceful and democratic transfers of power.

I left race as the last issue. We have never fully dealt with the legacy of slavery. Also part of this, I would add, we have never dealt with the genocide that marked the founding of our society on this land. We still have the myths racial superiority and inferiority, about cowboys and indians. I don't think there is a political solution to this. This is a spiritual matter. I jokingly posted a link to an article about perceiving oneness as the cure for our divisions... I actually don't think there is any other way. This unresolved injury, for everyone involved - the descendants of the perpetrators and the descendants of the victims. IMO, there's a practical reason as part of our right livelihood we're not supposed to be butchers - the act of killing leaves deep marks on the one's doing the killing - comparable to the survivors of the carnage, not to mention the death process as Buddhists understand it. Race is implicated in poverty, inequality, injustice... almost all the failures of our society implicate race. We need to do something about this... I think there is a reason why the Civil Rights movement, led by religious leaders, was so successful and would not have been as successful if it was just a secular movement.

All that is to say, you have a point, and these are not things we would want anyone to emulate. But we also have a lot of good things going on which are really really good.

Right now, we have a moron as our spokesperson who doesn't get what we do. His whole political strategy is to get people feeling bad about how things are. "Carnage" he says. That kind of talk from the Bully Pulpit is not constructive. That just exacerbates pessimism and fear and is not conducive to cooperatively trying to fix our problems.

It was literally supposed to be two separate traditions, related, but separate, As Simon said, the idea in Shambhala was an idea of warriorship as a personal path, and in addition to his termas, Trungpa drew principally from mundane paths such as the worldly Bon vehicles like Phyva Bon and also Confucianism, according to his own account. His idea was that Shambhala training was a place where anyone could go and learn the principles of meditation-based spiritual warriorship, predicated on the model of Buddhist kings, etc., without having to sign up, take refuge, and so on. In the old days, people could do the ten levels, without ever thinking that they ought to make the jump into Buddhism-- I met several such people back in the late 80's. Of course, at that time, if one made it through the ten levels, went to Warrior Assembly and so forth, one might be strongly encouraged to then proceed along the Buddhist path, but the pure Shambhalians I knew then were quite certain they were following a complete and independent path that was not Buddhism per se. Then Osel Mukpo started giving refuge names like Crystal Spear Warrior and so on, and within a few years, he merged the two systems, many people think to the detriment of the Shambhala teachings themselves.

You asked before about the Scorpion Seal teachings. Well, they are not Osel Mukpo's invention per se, but rather his commentary on the original Scorpion Seal terma of his father. But the people I spoke to about this recently really did not think they were worth much, content wise. Mukpo has no training.

From a lineage perspective the defining feature of the Shambhala organization was the terma system it propagated.

Malcolm wrote:
The Shambhala teachings were never meant to be mixed with Buddhist teachings at all, and they were never meant to be part of a guru transmitted system. I know this because I know people who "were there" when they were originally produced and when Shambhala training was first organized. I myself did the first three levels under the old system.

Indeed, there are older Shambhala students who will, eventually, continue the old system outside the present Shambhala International. The Shambhala teachings themselves are interesting.

You are trying to convince me that there is a single European identity and your only evidence of this is that there are various national identities?  I am giving you ample examples of how even the idea of a national identity is false.  Where is your evidence for a unified European identity?  NOWHERE
Likewise, there is kinship of all Europeans in the shared Greco-Roman foundation of their cultural heritage, Enlightenment values, Christian values, democracy, individual freedom and reason. There are also other things which, unfortunately, I cannot quite put my finger on; the fabric of the European identity is intricate and often very subtle. Nevertheless, they tie together the various European cultures together despite the obvious diversity and make the European identity being more than a social construct or the sum of the various national identities.

His Holiness the Dalai Lama is a major international figure. That usually means whatever such a person says or does, is viewed with interest. He is a Nobel Laureate (the Nobel Peace Prize, which he received back in the days when that prize meant something).

Moreover he is a major Buddhist teacher, so certainly he has the attention from those who are interested in, sympathetic with, or actually are Buddhists (certainly those who are Indo-Tibetan Buddhists). He is a refugee himself, since 1959, and is considered a leader of his people, so he certainly has knowledge and experience of how it is to be a refugee. Then, from the point of view of Vajrayana itself, he certainly is the guru of many gurus (that we have), so that's one thing. Another is that he's considered to be an emanation of Avalokiteshvara himself.

I am sure there are many more factors as to why anybody are interested in his views on either this or that. And so yes, these things explain the why-question of yours above.

Put in more banal terms, would you argue that liberal democracy and fascism are equally enlightened?  I would not, and for this reason, I would say that failures to try for enlightenment in society (we can debate that definition) also end in tears.

Malcolm wrote:
Liberal Democracy never aimed at creating an enlightened society at all. It aimed a creating a society that was based on the recognition of common rights of human beings. Fortunately, its premises allowed the notion of who was a human being to expand, and thus under Liberal Democracy, rights have been increasingly extended towards those whose rights were not recognized under its original formulation. But the creation of an enlightened society was never at its base. Fascism and Socialism, on the other hand, have pretensions towards transcendence and enlightenment.

Everyone (or every adult) in his commune knew he was a teacher.  It was a de facto attempt to create an enlightened society because Changchub Dorje was trying to help everyone attain enlightenment (acknowledging that the language presents a barrier here).  I had thought that basically everyone there took rainbow body?  I was not aware that in some way it still continues (certainly not as a Dzogchen community though).

At any rate I presented a valid counterexample even though you will refuse to put the label on it so I think any reasonable person will have grounds to conclude that "attempts to create enlightened societies" do not always end in tears.  Just most of the time.  Because the teachers are not enlightened in some form and/or because the students are not capable of following through.

That to me differentiates cult vs. not.   (Of course cultish behavior is not mutually exclusive with the presence of abuse of power of various forms..)

Malcolm wrote:
"Crazy wisdom" is exclusive to Tibetan Buddhism. It was a term coined by Trungpa. It is pretty modern.

The idea that one must tolerate unusual behavior from one's guru is well established. What is not so well established is that converts tend to bring a certain fanaticism with them into the new faith to which they have converted. Is this idealism exploited? Yes, but this is little different than new recruits in an army who suffer all kinds of abuse at the hands of the powers that be to turn them into malleable foot soldiers. So, I still argue that power and its abuse is the real issue here, and claims of "Cultishness" are a distracting red herring.

It is not surprising at all that Trungpa created an army, the Vajra Guard, and that it remains the chief expression of Shambhala International's will to power. Attempts to create enlightened societies always end in tears.

Malcolm, do you still agree with this?

I have on and off knee and calf issues and the "long" prostrations that Tibetans do make me uncomfortable. In particular I find the "sliding out" from a kneeling position rather problematic. The sun salutation way is to jump backwards, into a pushup position, similar to burpees, which seems much healthier to me.

I never had a teacher who was really strict about prostrations of course, in fact, my teachers (besides ChNN of course) gave alternatives like even sitting prostrations if I do ngondro, although they said I could try doing some prostrations and see how it goes.

I am thinking of starting a complete ngondro starting next year, once I make a career change and complete the current practice accumulations I am doing.

When we find the same kind of behavior happening in corporate settings, we don't label such behavior "cult behavior." We call it what it is: abuse of power.

The point is that he was recognised by the head of a lineage and received traditional training from members of recognised lineages.

Malcolm wrote:
ChNN was actually first recognized by his  uncle as the reincarnation of Adzom Drukpa. He was also recognized as the reincarnation of a Sakya Khenpo. The 16th Karmapa recognition came much later.

Malcolm wrote:
These qualifiers do not prove anything. I know people recognized by this or that lineage head, trained in the great monasteries, who are absolute frauds and scoundrels in every respect.

But that is not my point. For example, no one recognized Ngala Changchub Dorje as a great terton until decades after he passed away. Everyone thought he was just a doctor. It was only after he attained rainbow body that people took note.

Indeed, in a real sense, most Lamas in traditional Tibet lacked these very qualifications that are so prized in the West. Even so, if these qualifications were not so prized in Tibet as well, people would not feel the need to pester high lamas into recognizing their children as Yangsi X and Tulku Y.

If you do not have the karma to study with this or that "highly qualified" lama, no matter what you do, you will never be able to attend their teachings. It is sort of like the conception of a child. If the gandhavara, the bardo being, does not have proper karma with a certain set of parents, there is no basis for a conception.

Nothing we say about this woman has any relevance to her or her students. She found a Tibetan lama to back her, learned Tibetan, gained academic credentials, etc. In order to question her credentials, you have to question his, and so on and so forth.

In the end, it all comes down to what oneself accepts and rejects.

The tantras do not say, "Examine master so and so for his lineage recognitions, endorsements, associates, etc." What do they say? They mention nothing about lineage heads, etc.  They only mention the personal qualities and learning of the prospective master in question.

Dan, you sure give people the benefit of the doubt. Me? I consider stupidity to be a terminal trait affecting most of humanity not leaving a whole lot of hope. Most people are motivated by petty impulses grounded in fear and selfishness, and these Alt-Right are pure fear and selfishness.

Talking to these bozos to get them to walk back their motivation, while a nice idea, won't get anywhere because the reason faculty is clearly compromised in them, either because they are congenitally stupid or because they've thought themselves too far down this path already. These idiots have built a whole ecosystem of meaning based on their impulses. You're not going to bring that down with an earnest conversation at a kissing booth.

We need leaders who offer a compelling alternative. Just talking a good game is not enough. Its got to be demonstrated in a way of life. Toynbee (a flawed person who had some compelling ideas) argued that societies flourish or die because of how they manage the challenge-and-response dynamic. He argued, the way this plays out - its not that all the members of society somehow spontaneously rise to the challenge before them, but rather, a creative minority emerges who comes up with a solution to a particular challenge. The rest of the masses then follow along through the process of mimesis. Their ability is limited to seeing a good idea and copying it.

What compelling alternative is there for these guys? Our creative minority, the tech crowd, the ascendant cohort with the money, the fame, and exciting function in society, actually thinks like them. On a whole, tech bros lean libertarian in that dickish Ayn Rand sort of way. Its not going out on a limb to say there is considerable overlap between the tech crowd and 4chan /pol/. Peter Thiel, aside from being gay, is only a few degrees removed from Richard Spencer in terms of his overall attitude. Tim Draper, the silicon valley bozo who wants to break California up into different states, demonstrates this impulse to segregate - that's what breaking up the state is all about - segregation. The difference his criteria is political and economic rather than racial and cultural.

I assume most readers here are Buddhist, so I'd recommend Bob Thurman's Inner Revolution. He points out the effect that Buddhism, particularly monastic Buddhism, had on India and Asia in general. Basically, it led to pacification. He argues its better for young men to bang their heads against the wall conquering their "self" than unleashing that energy on society. He argues the drawback for Buddhism is that Buddhism gets infused with machismo, but overall, society is better when young men are occupied with Dharma. That's sublimation of that energy in the best way so far. Thurman goes on to describe a society that is devoted to peace and life of the mind and proposes ways to do that.

I've read references to texts translated into Chinese much earlier that make reference to six-syllable dharani associated with the six forms of Avalokitesvara. Are there such texts in the Kangyur?

Is there significance to there being six syllables?

In Japan, the chant I've heard associated with Avalokitesvara is "Namu Kanzeon Bosatsu".

In general, six syllables stands for the six lokas.

A billion fields of Kusumatalagarbhālaṃkara 
exists in each pore
of Vairocanasagara. 
Every particle of his body is similar.
Every particle of that field is as numerous. 
Vairocana is the sambhogakāya
of Śākyamuni. 
Where ever that kāya and buddhafield reside,
that buddhafield combines all into one,
said to be the field of every sambhogakāya. 
In this manner, where ever space pervades, 
also the buddhafield and kāya of the victor exists.
In the absolute definitive meaning, however,
the kāya and buddhafield
are immeasurable, and no limit can be apprehended.

The above is standard late Indian Buddhist cosmology, and has come to be the standard Mahāyāna cosmology of Tibet.

According to Tibetan Medicine, one needs 8 hours of sleep. One should try to be asleep by 10, and one should rise at six. But since I am a terrible practitioner, I never follow even this advice. I am usually asleep by midnight, and awake between 8 or 9.

The best pure vision approach is original purity, that includes everything.

Practitioners are liberation through seeing by nature, whether they sleep alot or not, and whether they practice 30 seconds a day or 24 hours.

Hugger,

"I hope he also took full responsibility for such things as car accidents caused by exhausted and sleep-deprived students of his, trying to work, practice and have a family life at the same time -- essentially, trying to live two lives at the same time, one of a dharmic "profesional," the other of a Western regular joe."

Have you tried dag-nang (pure vision) yet?

The five transformations when listening to the Dharma:

1. The Teacher as whatever Buddha is associated with the teaching or as Shakyamuni, Guru Rinpoche, etc. In other words, if the teaching is about Manjushri, then the Teacher is Manjushri. If the teaching is about Avalokiteshwara, then the Teacher is Avalokiteshwara. If the teaching is originally by Guru Rinpoche, then the Teacher is Guru Rinpoche.
2. The place as that Buddha's field, e.g., Potala, Sukhavati, Pema Od
3. The time as the fourth time, i.e., the time beyond past, present, and future
4. Those other listeners as that Buddha's Bodhisatva/Bodhisatvi disciples or as Pawos and Dakinis
5. The Teaching as the highest, most precious Teaching which is most applicable directly to you

IME, if one listens to the Dharma with one's ordinary discursive mind filled with dualism and doubt, maybe yes, maybe no, hard to get much traction.

Similarly, hard to make much progress if one is "trying to live two lives," one Dharmic and the other samsaric. In my experience, the trick is to live one's life Dharmically regardless of the activities one is engaged in. There does not need to be any separation. There's a way to make any activity a Dharmic activity as long as it is not inherently non-virtuous. That's the skillful means of Vajrayana. But it all depends on dag-nang and, moment by moment, implementing those skillful means. As they say, practice makes perfect. Granted, this is easier said than done, but who said attaining perfectly complete, unsurpassed Enlightnement was easy

treehuggingoctopus said:
I think we are talking past each other here.

I wholeheartedly agree that we have to make as much of our life as possible (all of it, ultimately) into Dharma activity. There is plainly no other way.

Then there is the question of our formal practice -- a type of Dharmic activity which, while entirely necessary for us Western householders, poses a particular challenge. To illustrate: in the traditional framework, a committed practitioner (the, for the lack of better words, "Dharmic professional") goes into retreat, which will last at least three years and during which he or she probably will not have any non-religious duties (hence the opportunity to focus almost solely on formal practice, doing a complete ngondro in three months, etc). I can readily imagine that if one is relatively healthy, and enjoys a community support (or at least the support of a culture which on some level recognises the validity of that sort of endeavour) one could sleep very little indeed. Those of us who already have families and are forced to have regular, 9-5 jobs find themselves in an entirely different situation -- our non-religious duties consume the better part of our lives, and finding time for regular formal practice will be often very difficult indeed. We also need our sleep (and food, decent health, etc.) -- and yes, it is a tightrope walk, precisely the one which I had in mind when I wrote of us struggling to lead two lives at the same time. The fact that the Western world (which at least a part of our family, friends, neighbours very, very much belong to) perceives what we do as either a form of insanity or a eccentric leisure activity does not help either, euphemistically put.

I can allocate between two and three hours a day to my formal practice. At least once in a fortnight, on average, I am so tired that I literally fall asleep on the cushion. Cutting down on sleep would be just plainly irresponsible, to put it mildly. (Actually, I have discovered that not exceeding two hours of formal practice a day and allowing myself to skip sessions when I am really tired both increases the quality of my formal practice and greatly helps the Dharma to seep into my post-session life.)

As for a different empowerment for the same deity being irrelevant, isn't that a bit strange, it is not like it is a completely different deity because it comes from a different terma. It is still the same attributes etc. It is something I have thought about before, so it would be good if there was some authoritative answer on the matter.

Pero said:
Well for example I think Malcolm mentioned somewhere that if you get an empowerment into a mandala of one cycle, you can't do practices of another cycle even if it's the same diety, because it's a completely different mandala. However occasionally I see that when there are requirements for receiveing some teachings it may be something like "any empowerment of Guru Rinpoche".

I have heard from a few people who were there that when ChNN was first giving the donwang of Jnanadakini (~2005), Khyentse Yeshe reported that the Boss had told him that the donwang is exactly the same (bells and whistles aside) as the more traditional Longsal Root Initiation; they are both equally valid, and if ChNN did not give the donwang previously it was because he had not received it himself yet. Still, since then Rinpoche has given the LRI at least twice, in 2010 and in 2014.

In essence yeah but it's not just "bells and whistles" that are different as far as I can recall.

Bristollad said:
This is covered in Chapter 1, topic 3 of the Exalted Knower of All Aspects: Mahayana Path of Preparation in the Abhisamayalamkara.

From course notes:

On the Mahayana path of accumulation of those of definite Mahayana lineage: there is a fully qualified application in complete aspects and wisdoms arisen from meditation observing impermanence, suffering, unattractiveness, etc. However, there is no wisdom arisen from meditation that observes emptiness.

When the wisdom arisen from meditation observing emptiness is initially generated, someone who is of definite Mahayana lineage transfers to the Mahayana path of preparation.

Note: It is (according to this system) not very common but some hearers and solitary realizers also realize the emptiness of true existence. These may then later enter the Mahayana path and proceed along to Buddhahood. Such practitioners already possess a wisdom arisen from meditation that observes emptiness before they enter the Mahayana path of preparation. Therefore, unless we only speak about Bodhisattvas of definite Mahayana lineage, there is no pervasion that the path of preparation starts with the first generation of a wisdom arisen from meditation that observes emptiness.

Three wisdoms
Wisdom arisen from hearing: a wisdom arisen mainly from hearing (or reading) the meaning of the scriptures.
Wisdom arisen from contemplation: a wisdom arisen mainly from the contemplation of the meaning of the scriptures that one has heard (or read) befrore.
Wisdom arisen from meditation: a wisdom arisen mainly in dependence on familiarizing with the understanding that has been generated during contemplation with a mind that is based on a union of calm abiding and special insight.

Three types of wisdom observing emptiness
Question: What are the differences between the three types of wisdom observing emptiness?
Response: Wisdom arisen from hearing or wisdom arisen from contemplation: although a meaning generality of emptiness dawns well, the object and the object-possessor appear as though unrelated due to being together with very coarse dualistic appearances.
Wisdom arisen from meditation: although there are dualistic appearances, due to having overcome the coarse dualistic appearances as in the previous two cases, it appears as if one has penetrated the object.
Such a dawning of the meaning-generality of emptiness is described as “dharmata appearing clearly” due to being transformed in a manner of water placed in water.

Nevertheless, this is not a clear appearance that is free from conceptions. Instead, at the time of the Mahayana path of preparation of somebody of definite Mahayana lineage, there is a clear appearance of a meaning-generality during a conceptual realization of emptiness which is a wisdom arisen from meditation; there is not yet a clear appearance of emptiness at that time.

Many of those people were taking drugs, but in some cases drugs could have been the Buddha’s skillful means to help break those people’s concepts. They had such unbelievably fixed minds, fixed ideas—strong, unchangeable beliefs that there was just this one life; no understanding that the mind can exist without the body. Their thinking was unbelievably gross. People like this needed something external to break their concepts and enable them to see things more deeply. Drugs gave them many experiences such as the mind being able to travel without the body, which shocked and surprised them, because it was completely opposite to what was taught and believed in the West.

Drugs, whether we like it or not, have always been intimate part of tantric ritual (it seems not of Dzogchen, though). Cannabis, but of course also other drugs.

If the manifestations are impermanent, how can wisdom be permanent? A permanent entity (wisdom) can not give rise to an impermanent manifestation (display). Further, if wisdom is free from the four extremes, also its product, the display, must be free from the four extremes, not established in any way, being itself similar to an illusion or a mirage.

Further, you make it sound as if there are two phases: being in the dzogchen state and not being in the dzogchen state. Since there is nothing that is not in the dzogchen state, how can there be a phase of being in the dzogchen state and not being in the dzogchen state?

Years ago, I floated a possible Chinese medical mechanism for LSD's psychedelic effects. I'd be very interested in hearing the TTM description of exactly what happens when one "drops acid."

ChNN asserts that these substances "charge one's energy," meaning in translation, cause a disturbance or agitation in one's rlung.

This is from Keith Dowman, in Natural Perfection, Longchenpa's Radical Dzogchen:

"In the Dzogchen view there is no prescriptive practise in which to engage in order to attain rigpa, and there is nothing that we can do to induce that view. Dzogchen 'nonmeditation' is a spontaneous noncontingent continuity—a timeless synchronistic awareness."

florin said:
I would say impermanence "happens" before dzogchen. It Is when we conventionally have "things" that appear to arise, decay and pass out of existence.
Impermanence is something that is observed when one hasn't yet understood the real "essence" of one's state.

"When my nature is not understood and the phenomena that manifest from me become the object of judgement, desire and attachment give rise to the creation of concrete vision that is impermanent and destined to vanish like a magical apparition, and one becomes like a blind man who does not know what is happening."

"Self-arising wisdom, the essence of all the Buddhas, exists prior to the division of samsara and nirvana and is beyond the limits of transmigration and liberation. As it transcends the four conceptual limits and is intrinsically pure, this original condition is the uncreated nature of existence that has always existed, the ultimate nature of all phenomena. It cannot be identified with a stable and eternal substance allowing the assertion "It is thus!" and is utterly free of all the defects of dualistic thought, which is only capable of referring to an object other than itself. It is given the name ineffable and inconceivable "base of primordial purity" KG

2. Slightly different: Understanding can spark an experience (separate from the experience of understanding itself). For example, if a sufficiently 'ripe' student reads about emptiness, it could spark an experience of the emptiness of the reading and reader (and read). Can this be the 'experience' in the formula?

Dana is not confined to dropping a dollar in the box at the door to the practice hall, it's also generosity of spirit; giving people the benefit of the doubt, and thinking the best of them. Private conversations are impossible to corroborate, and I'm committed to the old-fashioned notion that someone's innocent until proven guilty. What I find disturbing about this is when considered in toto; the consistent accounts of several others of how high-ranking officials in the organization allegedly aided and abetted in a pattern of exploitation and cover-up, including sexual assault and statutory rape, how several accounts spoke of this as an "open secret" in the upper echelons of the organization, and Ethan Nichtern's statement detailing how promotion and advancement within the organization was inextricably linked to personal loyalty and devotion, not to the organization, but to the leader himself; a cult of personality. Pema Chodron is a high-ranking leader in that organization, and innocent or guilty, when this shit hits the fan everyone in that inner circle is going to get splattered, justly or otherwise. If nothing else, it's illustrative of how the consequences of our actions can ripple outward on a macro scale, having unintended consequences for good or ill far beyond our limited knowledge and immediate circle.

I am talking about reality, not theory.  Are you saying that you do not experience bodily pleasure or mental suffering?  Do these experiences not arise as a consequence of karmavipaka?

Isn't beauty, long life and good health (bodily attributes) a consequence of positive karma vipaka?

Malcolm wrote:
These are part of throwing karma, but the actual sensations we feel in these existences that are a result of karma are differentiated on the basis of whether their cause is virtuous or nonvirtue, and all nonvirtue ripens as pain in the body and all virtue ripens as pleasant feelings in the mind.

This is one reason that in Tibetan Medicine, for example, mental suffering is dealt with as a physical problem.

My understanding of the teaching on karma is that the primary factor is one’s state of mind at the moment of death, compounded by the habitual actions and predominant experiences over one’s lifetime. When LZR teaches about death, he advises us to make our loved ones’ passing as calm and positive as we can for that reason.

I have been involved in euthanizing a cat and my observation was that it was done with the utmost respect. She had people who cared for her around her helping to make her feel at ease and I saw no evidence that the lethal injection was anything but painless, gentle, and swift.

Is it not better for their karma that a being should die in a peaceful state of mind than wracked with physical pain?

Also, no one addressed Greg’s point about easing physical pain in general. If the reason not to euthanize is that this cycle of the being’s ripening karma must be allowed to play out “naturally”, then why is it ok to intervene in any suffering situation?

Malcolm wrote:

I am pretty sure that a cat suffering from a great amount of pain, near death but not quite there, would still resist your attempts to kill it, as would every creature.

So in general, I am pretty sure euthanizing pets, for example, is not a course I would recommend. However, if an animal is rabid, there is little choice in the matter. I don't think there is any reasonable objection to killing diseased animals or animals that carry diseases harmful to humans, such as mosquitos, ticks, and so on. This is just common sense.

Either description is valid IMO. R is not B and B is not R for the ends of the line segments that do not intersect. At the intersection there is no difference between R and B. Representing the area of intersecting congruency as P/purple is a graphical convention. It is both R and B.

So it's really up to the perceiver to decide where the identity of the intersecting dhaatava.h is measured from. Do we look at the whole and decide that "same" does not apply because of the differentiated ends of the segments? Do we look at the whole and decide that "different" does not apply because of their congruent segments? Do we look at the whole and decide that "not same" does not apply because substantial parts of it are the same? Do we look at the whole and decide that "not different" does not apply because the two segments are different?

Malcolm wrote:
In Buddhist thinking, continuity is only accounted for by the logic of "neither the same nor different." For example, if a seed as utterly different than a sprout, there is no causal relationship between the two; so they cannot be utterly different. Since sprout will not arise if it is the same as the seed, a seed and a sprout cannot be the same.

It doesn't apply to drawings of overlapping red and blue lines.

Yes.  That's quite the question isn't it?  Except to many patients (who haven't been listened to).
The over adminstration of pain management medicines such as Oxycontin has created an wide spread opioid addiction epidemic in the US, it is only with the past 5 years that medical personal have started to severely limit the amount and duration in the administration of pain management meds.
That's not what happened.  For decades, maybe generations, doctors restricted pain medication severely in apparently most cases (at least a lot of cases) acting out of skepticism and fear.

Just one paper (amoungst many) to back up my basic argument that pain treatment is substandard : http://www.jabfm.org/content/14/3/211.full.pdf
Barriers to Effective Pain Management
Undertreatment of Pain

In a recent study of 805 chronic pain sufferers, it was reported that more than 50% found it necessary to change physicians in their quest for pain relief. Specific reasons for changing physicians included lack of physicians’ willingness to treat the pain aggressively, failure to take the pain seriously, and lack of knowledge about pain management.3 In a study of 1,308 outpatients with metastatic cancer,11 67% (871) of the patients reported that they had pain or had taken analgesic drugs daily during the week preceding the study, and 36% (475) had pain severe enough to impair their ability to function. Forty-two percent of those with pain were not given adequate analgesic therapy. A discrepancy between patient and physician in judging the severity of the patient’s pain was predictive of inadequate pain management. One third of practitioners reported that they would wait until the patient had less than 6 months to live before starting the maximal tolerated analgesia for severe pain.

The supply of prescription opioids remains high in the U.S.4 An estimated 1 out of 5 patients with non-cancer pain or pain-related diagnoses are prescribed opioids in office-based settings.3 From 2007 – 2012, the rate of opioid prescribing has steadily increased among specialists more likely to manage acute and chronic pain. Prescribing rates are highest among pain medicine (49%), surgery (37%), and physical medicine/rehabilitation (36%). However, primary care providers account for about half of opioid pain relievers dispensed. 3

MONDAY, July 31, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- More than one out of three average Americans used a prescription opioid painkiller in 2015, despite growing concerns these medicines are promoting widespread addiction and overdose deaths, a new federal study shows.

Nearly 92 million U.S. adults, or about 38 percent of the population, took a legitimately prescribed  opioid like OxyContin or Percocet in 2015, according to results from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health.

"The proportion of adults who receive these medications in any year seemed startling to me," said study co-author Dr. Wilson Compton, deputy director of the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse.

"It's an awful lot of people who take these, mostly for medical purposes, but within that a significant percentage end up misusing them," he added.

The survey found that 11.5 million people, or nearly 5 percent of the population, misused prescription opioids they'd obtained through illicit means.

Incidentally, the "Noble Silence" itself is position 4, the eel-wriggler's.

The difference is that the amaravikṣepa has no thesis, and the Buddha, allegedly, has a thesis, which is dependent origination.

That is really the only thing separating the Buddhas and the eel-wrigglers.

Of course, above, when I said, "the Buddha, allegedly, has a thesis," the "a position, Vacchagotta, is something that the Tathāgata has done away with" (severe paraphrase) quote came to mind.

Is "no thesis" itself a thesis?

Wayfarer said:
I presume you’re familiar with the fact that Nāgārjuna says that he maintains no thesis of his own?

But, he says, this can be done without actually advancing a view of one’s own. Or so I understand.

The proposition to which Nāgārjuna was referring was a proposition about inherent existence, svabhāva, in the Vigrahavyavartani.

A former Shambhala member here,

I am fortunate that although I was close to taking Samaya with the Sakyong, I had not yet done so.  So I am spared the devastating questions about whether I would be breaking Samaya by leaving the community. (Though i hope those I know who did are able to leave)

So I want to know what people think about changing to a new community. What should I consider?  Have you ever done this?  How long should one wait before diving all the way in to a new sangha?

I got the online Dzogchen transmission from Namkai Norbu some years back, but I also appreciate a structured approach. I recently restarted doing the very short daily practice he recommends to keep the connection to the transmission. But I am interested in doing a traditional Ngyondro.

I am impressed by Mingyur Rinpoche, both his history of practice, and his strong statements against abusive teachers. I think this is one of the main things I will be looking for now, I really only want to study with a teacher who has made strong statements against abuse and not made any that could be considered a defense of abusers (which is how I interpreted some of Dzongsar Kyentse's statements, for example).

I live in Massachusetts but not near any Tergar community. There are Zen and Insight Meditation places near me. Would doing Tergar's online program be legitimate?  And once I get to the Vajrayana, can anyone tell me if the Sadhanas will be in English?  I feel like this is important.  To understand what I will be saying during a Sadhana practice, excluding the mantras.
I would probably be able to make trips to see Mingyur Rinpoche in NYC when he travels through once in a while.

Thank you!
Any tips and help will be much appreciated.

Ann saw lots of people come, but she began to notice that there were parents bringing young teenage girls. The girls seemed nervous. The parents occasionally said something like, “This is such an honor for you to have this experience.” Then a kusung would come for the girl and the parents would leave. Ann worked directly below the Sakyong’s bedroom and since there was no air conditioning, in the summer the windows were open. Ann could hear what sounded distinctly like sexual encounters.
There were talks of having him return after his 1 year break from teaching. I don't think he'll be coming back from this.

From the introduction to the translation of Tantra of the Great Liberation (Mahanirvana Tantra) by Arthur Avalon:

"Whilst sadhana is, as stated a process for the stimulation of sattva guna (constructive qualities), it is evident that one form of it is not suitable to all.  It must be adapted to the spiritual condition of the sishya (disciple), otherwise it will cause injury instead of good.  Therefore persons who are not competent may not only be fruitless of any good result, but may even lead to evils which sadhana as a general principle is designed to prevent.  Therefore it is said that it is better to follow one's own dharma than that, however exalted it be, of another."

Coëmgenu said:
What is the way of explaining in mundane convention? It is explained here:

Everything is true; untrue; true and untrue;
and neither true nor untrue: that is the Buddha's doctrine.

"Everything is true" because the sense bases such as the eye and so, and the objects such as form and so on, do not contradict the truth of convention (vyavahāra). "[Everything is] untrue" because based on ultimate truth, whatever appears does not exist in that way because its nature is totally unestablished like an illusion. "[Everything is] true and untrue" because of depending on the aspects of the two truths. "[Everything is] neither true nor untrue" because at the time of realization, the yogi does not conceptualize the suchness of all phenomena in all aspects.

Further, "everything is true" is valid because the Bhagavan explains the invariable characteristic of the absence of I and mine as knowable in order to abandon the afflictive obscuration. "[Everything is] untrue" is valid because he describes an agent who hears, reflects, and meditates because there is a characteristic of consciousness that is endowed with a sense of "I have" and a sense of "mine." "[Everything is] true and untrue" is valid with respect to the conventions of the world and the śāstras. "[Everything is] neither true nor untrue" is valid because the ultimate nonarising of all phenomena is the domain of both conceptual and nonconceptual consciousnesses, however, any entities discriminated as false and discriminated as true do not exist that way.

"That is the doctrine of the Buddha" means whatever teaching is introduced by those four steps in order to truly obtain the benefit of sentient beings, that is a teaching by the Bhagavān Buddha.

If you think that passage is about samatha and vipasyana, you're missing the full import. Again, that passage is a conclusion of a significantly more involved argument. At this point, samatha and vipasyana are not distinguishable from reality itself... that's what the reference to thoughts integrated with reality refers to.

Relative truth is not nonveridical. It is relative.

There are two kinds of false cognitions in this respect; false with respect to natures but not with respect to aspects. An example would be a realists assertion that atoms truly exist. Then there is delusion -- seeing two moons in the sky. Conventional truths are the former kind of relative truth.

Queequeg said:
For example, if one perceives the hardness and solidity of a rock, one is not perceiving the suchness of the rock. If one is perceiving the suchness of the rock, its emptiness, absence of inherent existence, etc., one is not perceiving the conventional attributes of a rock. The gist of the complete statement above is that when one is in āryan equipoise, all sense datum are perceptions of the ultimate nature of things. This is perfectly fine. No one can have a problem with this who understands Mahāyāna Buddhism.
In Zhiyi's Sudden and Perfect, the distinction you draw  between relative perceptions and ultimate perception are not there, they are simultaneous. This is what he means by the Middle - the complete identity of relative and absolute. To distinguish the two modes of perception is the definition of the Separate or Distinct Truth.
I understood the point of the passage. I agree with the point of the passage -- when one is āryan equipoise, all experience is the experience of the ultimate, smelling a flower, being hit on the head with a rock, and so on. In that equipoise, there is nothing that is not an experience of the ultimate. Some other schools may imagine that conventional things disappear in such an equipoise, but that is not correct. It still does not mean your identity proposition is defensible.
The identity is actually the point of one of the central Tiantai teachings.

Malcolm wrote:
[/quote]


But that is not what happens in your use of the tetralemma, you just make four mutually exclusive statements. You do not end up in inconceivability, you end up with four propositions about a rock. You'd get laughed out of Nalanda.

Your use is like this: "A rock is water; a rock is not water; a rock is both water and not water; a rock is neither water nor not water." These are not four negations, which is what the tetralemma is supposed to be. These are four affirmations.

A proper tetralemma is, for example, the tetralemma that refutes arising in the MMK:

An existence does not arise from an existent. 
An existent does not arise from a nonexistent. 
A nonexistent does not arise from an existent. 
A nonexistent does not arise from a nonexistent. 
Where can there be arising?

This kind of properly formed tetralemma results inexpressibility/inconceivability because it leads one to it through negation, not through affirmation.

I did not propose that. That is an incomplete representation of what I keep writing. You'd have to also go through the other three assertions of the tetralemma. Rocks are not suchness. Rocks are both suchness and not sucheness. Rocks are neither suchness nor not suchness.

This is why we see the Buddha rejecting tetralemmas formed as identity propositions in other schools.

Your on firmer ground if you said something like "Matter is empty; emptiness is matter; there is no matter apart from emptiness; there is no emptiness apart from matter." This kind of identity proposition is absolutely faultless. You can substitute rock if you like with no harm at all: "A rock is empty; emptiness is a rock; there is not rock apart from emptiness; there is no emptiness apart from rock." This points to the fact that any given thing's ultimate nature is mutually inclusive with its relative nature -- the two are inseparable. But this still does not mean that "the buddhanature of insentient things" is a valid Buddhist doctrine.

Claiming that a rock has buddhanature violates convention because rocks do not have minds. It is that simple.

For example, claiming that water is dry is a violation of convention; claiming there are four moons in the August night sky on planet Earth is a violation of convention; claiming that the pink elephants you see because of detoxing on alcohol are real is a violation of convention.

Right. See Anders' post above as an example. Compare the meaning of Arya before and after the Buddha redefined the term.

This is a non-argument. You can certainly call a dog a lion, but it will never roar, only bark. Diachronic changes in language do not impact the argument that conventions are called conventions because they describe functions. For example, we call an assemblage of mechanical parts a car due to its function, not because we think there is some ultimate carness. You can call it a motorized buggy, etc., but the point is that a car is car because it functions like a car. A rock or a stone, or whatever you want to call a mineral composite does not have buddhanature because it is not the function of a rock to attain buddhahood since a rock has no mind and is not sentient. A sentient being has a mind, and so is capable of the function of attaining buddhahood, not because there is some ultimate buddhaness. If there were ultimate buddhaness then we could claim that rocks have buddhanature. There is no ultimate buddhaness, thus, claiming a rock has buddhanature is no better than asserting that water is dry.

Its only an error if you asset that the ultimate is exclusively the specific characteristic.

A svalakṣana cannot be a samanyalakṣana and vice versa by definition. Thus, the characteristic of the ultimate is exclusively a general characteristic.

The Buddha demonstrates this by stating, "All the characteristics of the compounded cannot become the general characteristic, the characteristic of the ultimate...the characteristic of the ultimate cannot be designated as the characteristic of the universally afflicted, because all characteristics of the compounded would become the general characteristic, the characteristic of the ultimate."

Queequeg said:
Its also error to reify the distinction.

Malcolm wrote:
But it is not an error to make this necessary distinction. Why? Because otherwise, as pointed out in the Samdhinirmocana sūtra, if one does not make a distinction, all nonveridical cognitions become cognitions of the ultimate, and this is a very negative consequence. It is not as simple as the summary statement makes it seem. The Buddha explain four reasons why stating the ultimate and relative are the absolutely same are faulty, as well as four reasons why stating they are absolutely different is faulty; but in reality, the first four faults are more grave than the latter four.

The Buddha discusses this problem in detail in the Samdhinirmocana Sūtra, in Chapter Three. One must distinguish between the ultimate and the compounded, but this does not mean they have no relation, like a sun and its rays. As the Buddha says in the Samdhinirmocana, the ultimate is the general characteristic (samanyalakṣana) of the relative.

However, it is a category error to assert that the ultimate is the specific characteristic (svalakṣana) of a given relative entity. But even worse, if you assert the identity proposition "rocks are suchness," you are asserting that a compounded thing, a rock, is ultimate. That makes you a realist.

The Buddha asserts that stating an absolutely identity or difference between the ultimate and the relative are both problematical. He concludes this chapter by stating:

The characteristic of compounded entities and the ultimate
is the characteristic of being neither the same nor different; 
those who conceive sameness and difference
are improperly oriented.

On the other hand, the Buddha states nowhere that making conventional distinctions between dharmin and dharmatā is similarly fraught. In fact, as you know, Nāgārjuna points out that it is a great fault not to recognize the distinction between the two truths.

Antiochus said:
I believe Jayarava did "address" this part in the first and second essays linked above. Essentially he agrees by the late 7th century Wonchuk does have a Sanskrit version. But since Wonchuk never avowed the Indian authenticity of that Sanksrit text openly, one way or the other, in his Heart Sutra commentary, it appears suspicious.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, in fact Wonchuk does avow the authenticity of the Sanskrit copy with which he is familiar by pointing out flaws in the earlier translation at his disposal. This itself is a testimony to the fact that Wongchuk regards the text as authentic. If he did not think it authentic, he never would have bother composing a commentary. Esteemed paṇḍitas like Wongchuk don't waste their time writing commentaries on texts they regard as of questionable provenance. There is also the fact that he addresses the Heart Sūtra in his commentary on the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra when he discusses the different names used at the beginning of sūtras:

Some are also called by two names, such as the Mtshams sbyor rnam par grol ba'i mdo (unidentified) and Prajñāpāramitā-hṛdaya...The Prajñāpāramitā-hṛdaya is called two names [Bhagavāti and Prajñāpāramitāhridaya] because the compiler condensed it from the extensive texts.

Here, the sdud pa po, the compiler, refers to the hearer, "Thus have I heard...", i.e. Ananda. Whether we accept this or not, for Wonchuk, this text was compiled out of the extensive PP literature by Ananda himself.

The questions are relevant if sunyata is the same as dependent arising.

Why?  Because dependent arising is the reason why there is the phenomena of sentient beings and inanimate things.  If you disagree with this, please explain why you disagree.
Malcolm, I shall assume that your silence means that you are unable to disagree with my statement above.  If so, then since for your suchness is sunyata and since sunyata is dependent arising (assumed by your above-mentioned silence), please respond if you can to my earlier questions reproduced below for your convenience:

If by suchness, you meant dependent arising, then your statement above implies that both inanimate things and sentient beings are dependently arisen. No problem here.

But when you say that the difference between inanimate things and sentient beings is that sentient beings are permeated with consciousness, are you saying that consciousness is not dependently arisen? If yes, then how does consciousness exist? Beyond suchness?

If you say that consciousness is dependently arisen, then is that dependent arising process distinct from the dependent arising process for inanimate things? If you say they are not distinct, then what is consciousness can become inanimate through the same dependent arising process and what is inanimate can become conscious through the same dependent arising process. Is this your position?

If you say that the dependent arising process is distinct, then the realm of phenomena necessarily is a duality of the inanimate and the conscious. Is this your position?

By answering the above questions, readers can then decide whether your arguments on the distinction between a sentient being and an insensible thing make sense or not.  As it stands, your arguments appear to reflect an internally inconsistent or incoherent position on sentient being and insensible thing.

As for the “Kuan-zizai Bodhisattva”, the first part of [the sūtra], [that is, from “Kuan-zizai Bodhisattva … .” to “crosses over all sufferings and calamities”] may be subdivided in two [ways]: first, by indicating the person who can contemplate; second, by illustrating the essence of the contemplating wisdom. [The “Kuan-zizai Bodhisattva”] refers to the first [approach], to indicate the person who can contemplate. According to the old version of the translation [of the Praj@2p2ramit2-s^tras], the Kuan-shi-yin is designated as the one who contemplates the sounds of the world. By calling the name of [Kuan-shi-yin] Bodhisattva, accompanied with verbal deeds, [sentient beings] are saved from all disasters. This is how the name is established and called Kuan-shi-yin. Yet the power to contemplate bodily and mental deeds is not revealed [in the name of Kuan-shi-yin]. However, the “Kuan-zizai” mentioned in this scripture refers to the one who internally realizes the twofold emptiness while externally contemplating the three deeds effortlessly and acting at his/her unrestricted discretion. Therefore [he/she] is named “Kuan-zizai.”

Malcolm wrote:
Here, he makes a point about the difference in translating Avalokiteśvara's name between the old translation and the revised version done by Hsuan Tsang.

And:

Unknown said:
A version [of the Heart Sūtra] states that “[The Bodhisattva] illuminatingly sees that the five aggregates, etc., are all empty.” Although there are two different versions, the latter [that is, the new version] is the correct one because the word “etc.” is found in the original Sanskrit scripture. [The meaning of] “etc.”described in the latter [version] should be understood based on [the doctrine of Dharmapāla].

Malcolm wrote:
And here is another example where an old and revised version are mentioned:

Unknown said:
(i) In interpreting the name, the old [version] called it nirvāṇa in Sanskrit or niwon, which may be translated as “tranquil extinction” in [the Chinese] language. Hsüan-tsang of T'ang China called it parinirvāṇa,which means “perfect stillness” because it is ultimately free from obstructions, saṃsāra and disturbances. Yet in order to preserve the name [used] in the old [version], it is called nirvāṇa.

The effect of this statistic is that although there is a split between church and state, in reality the U$ functions as a Christian nation.

I think I’m only responding to myself but maybe somebody else will bite:
Dogen being the most prominent later exegete of this doctrine, isn’t his point not that the insentient HAVE buddha nature, but that they ARE buddha nature?
Which I take just to mean that the phenomenal world is implicated in and inseparable from awakening.
Seems to me that that project is quite different from quasi-abhdharmic divvying up of of the world into what has and doesn’t have buddha nature?

Malcolm wrote:
Dogen was fully within the Tientai tradition, philosophically speaking, so that makes his ideas less radical then they appear on first glance.

Then the second problem one has to parse is what exactly does on mean by "buddhanature," if not tathāgatagarbha?

If by buddhanature, one means that everything is awakened intrinsically, then one has to parse exactly what awakening means, if not the absence of afflictions through insight into the reality of things.

This is addressed by the six causes and four conditions taught by the Sarvastivadins.

In the translation of Bodhidharma's words we have in Tibetan, his point is simple, "Once the view is confirmed, do not rely on scriptures." Sound advice.

The approach of Chan is superior to that of the gradual path advocated by Kamalashila.

On the other hand, both Longchenpa and Jigme Lingpa express skepticism about Tibetan treatments of Chan. Tulku Thundup discusses this in his Dzogchen Book.

A dispute arose in Chinese Buddhism with regard to whether insentient beings possess a Buddha nature, but the view that Buddhahood exists as a potential in all things and phenomena prevailed in China. This idea also became widespread in Japan. (See also enlightenment of plants.)
I am very interested in this teaching of "Buddha-nature of insentient beings" - my question is, is it exclusive to China (and by extension, Korea & Japan)?Is there anything close to this teaching to be found in any school of Tibetan Buddhism or in any Indian text?

Malcolm wrote:
No. Tathāgatagarbha strictly belongs to sentient beings (sattvas) in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism.

The self the Nirvana Sūtra is referring to is the dharmakāya. The dharmakāya pervades all phenomena because it is by definition the realization of the emptiness of all phenomena. This does not mean, however, that rocks possess tathāgatagarbha.

Before "skype conferencing" was available (during the Spanish Civil War, or the Makhnoist liberation of the Ukraine, for example) a community could send a representative to a confederate meeting, but the delegate was not allowed to make decisions on behalf of the community.

But I have to agree with Dan that for a system like this to really work, the citizens have to be aware and willing to cooperate.

Maintaining resistance, and continually calling out Trump and any other elected official when the racists are being defended by government officials.

To me, this is no different to the witchhunts of McCarthyism, when outing people for their beliefs ruined careers and lives. Of course, we could say the beliefs are poles apart, so that the tactic is justified. And yet to me this methodology smells bad both on a personal level and as a principle. There is a reason why freedom of thought is guaranteed in your constitution and curbing it by punishing people for their beliefs is an attack on something fundamental, is it not?

But the worst part to this approach seems to me to be the implied defeatism. "We cannot beat this ideology, so let's go after the people 'infected' with it. Let's punish them, make them suffer for their beliefs, make them even more resentful of the mainstream and the status quo, let's persecute them, drive them out. " Sounds familiar?

Second it holds that Oḍḍyāna was to the west:

When Garab Dorje reached eight years, he said, “Mother, you are happy here. To the west of here in the land of Oḍḍiyāna is Dhanakośa Island on the shores of the great outer ocean.

Third, there is the testimony of Orgyenpa Rinchenpal who visited Oḍḍiyāna in person in the 13th century. In order to get to Oḍḍiyāna he first traveled to Jalandhara in the Punjab. Oḍḍiyāna is described as being to the northwest of that city, and at the time of the thirteenth century, is described as being dominated by "Mongolians" speaking a Tajik language.

In fact, as far as I can tell, Oḍḍiyāna is the Tibetan name for the region of Pakistan in general.

Moreover, the Chinese traveler Faxian travelled to a place called Udyān, north of Peshwar, where people practiced mantra and what he considered a debased form of Mahāyāna.

I asked him in particular because I was seeking a certain response, from a certain generation, at a certain distance. I wanted an incredulous “yes” and a confused expression, as if I’d asked whether fire burns or if he’d like another drink.

In response, the anti-fascists of the 43 Group made it their business to identify, surveil, and physically confront, disrupt, and shut down fascist organizing in London and across Britain. They used knives, knuckledusters, and crowbars. “We’re not here to kill. We’re here to maim,” they would say. The group disrupted over 2,000 meetings over five active years and is widely credited for neutralizing postwar Britain’s fascist movement. "We defended the community by making it impossible for the fascists to terrorize us," one member, Jules Konopinski, told the Guardian in 2009 when he was 79 years old. The group’s militancy drew some contemporary censure from parts of the British Jewish establishment, but for the most part its place in history is either overlooked or lauded by historians, Holocaust memorial institutions, and anti-racist groups. Famed hairdresser Vidal Sassoon was an active fighter among the group—when he died in 2012, mainstream media obituaries described him as an “anti-fascist-warrior” who was “fighting back against fascist oppression.”

He succeeded in stabbing and killing a homeless man. Another white supremacist in Portland killed two men who were standing up for two Muslim women on a train. A Milo Yiannopolous fan in a Make America Great Again cap shot and wounded an anti-fascist counter-protester in the stomach outside a MIlo talk in Seattle. To name a few. In the ten days that followed Trump’s election alone, the Southern Poverty Law Center reported 900 separate incidents of bias and violence against immigrants, Latinos, African Americans, women, LGBT people, Muslims, and Jews.

Antifa activists are criticized for responding with counter-violence. Centrist liberals urge that we follow Michelle Obama’s gracious direction: “When they go low, we go high.” They urge debate with fascists, and decry violent or confrontational intervention.

...

Liberal appeals to truth will not break through to a fascist epistemology of power and domination—these are Spencer and his ilk’s first principles. And it is this aspect of fascism that needs to be grasped to understand the necessity of antifa’s confrontational tactics.

And that’s big, according to Hankes, because those still left are not down with the rally. Many posts about DC’s Unite the Right rally call it a “lawsuit trap.” Remember, there was a civil rights suit brought against the organizers of Unite the Right, and the judge has issued an opinion that the organizers had conspired to violate the civil rights of Charlottesville citizens, a conspiracy that could legally be tied to the death of Heather Heyer. “If I were the folks thinking about participating, I could be quite worried that my participation could link me to violent activity that violates civil rights,” says Richard Schragger, who specializes in Constitutional and local government law at the University of Virginia School of Law. “Even if you’re exercising your First Amendment rights, you’re responsible for the outcomes.”

The DC Unite the Right rally is shaping up to be a public announcement of a new, more cautious alt-right zeitgeist. It’s fuchsia and teal website looks like an ‘80s video game. The organizer, Jason Kessler—who, according to Hanke, is now something of a pariah—has banned the swastikas and the other symbols of white supremacy that so many objected to at the last rally. Kessler is trying to massage the movement into something (somewhat) more palatable, similar to the surviving organizations Identity Evropa and Patriot Front. Identity Evropa claims to protect cultural heritage, Patriot Front claims their prejudice is patriotism, and Kessler claims to be a civil rights advocate for white people.

All of which are lies that tell the truth: the open racism we all saw at Charlottesville is being slowly pushed underground.

Back in the 80's in New York there was a group called Missing Foundation. I was a little too young at the time, but from what I understand, they were basically the squatters in the East Village. They were involved with the Tompkins Sq. riots and clashes with police at the squats around there. They had some slogan, "We won't be civilized in this f*cking city!" They were straight up gutter punk anarchists.

Malcolm wrote:
You were a little too young to understand that incident. The police cause that riot.

Queequeg said:
New York City's Police Department deserves no praise for its handling of a demonstration in Tompkins Square Park in the early morning of Aug. 7. But Commissioner Ward and Police Department officials who prepared a report on the incident deserve credit for candor.

The document makes clear that what occurred was indeed the ''police riot'' some have charged. As the confrontation began to escalate, a panicky captain, finding himself in command because his deputy chief had left the scene, issued a ''10-85 forthwith'' radio call for help.

''This call is widely interpreted as being of an extreme emergency nature,'' the report says. Hundreds of police flooded into the area, though they ''had not been briefed about the event . . . were not equipped for such an encounter . . . were not under the direct supervision of a superior officer.''

Once they arrived, no one sought to form them into teams and supervise their deployment. ''Some officers obviously responded badly to these conditions,'' the report says, ''taking excessive independent actions and attempting to evade accountability by concealing their identities.''

Mr. Ward has forced the retirement of Deputy Chief Thomas Darcy, who left the scene; the transfer of Deputy Inspector Joseph Wodarski, and the retraining of Capt. Gerald McNamara, who issued the 10-85 call. The Civilian Complaint Review Board, meanwhile, has recommended departmental charges against two officers and will continue to sift 100 more complaints.

But the report makes clear that the riot reflected problems beyond individual conduct. It called for more training in crowd control and special units for riot duty. It also pointed to the department's recent rapid expansion. Thousands of new recruits lack experience on the street; the ranks of seasoned supervisors remain thin.

Those problems pose profound challenges for police management. The riot showed how dangerous the failure to recognize and confront them can be. The report suggests a commendable willingness to do so.

Queequeg said:
But the civil rights movement wasn’t seen as nonviolent in its day — and for good reason. The most jarring evidence of this came just a month after King’s Birmingham jail letter. In May 1963, movement organizers assembled black children , some still in pigtails, to march through the streets of Birmingham and confront Bull Connor’s violent police force. It was a controversial tactic within the movement, but organizers must have known that images of jailed, beaten and cowering children would affect hearts, force a response from officials and move the movement toward its goals.

“They couldn’t have been ignorant of the terrible response,” says King biographer and New York University historian David Levering Lewis. “King and his inner circle appreciated the probable certainty of violence on the part of the establishment to trigger responses that they wanted, in terms of legislation and policies.”  The children called it “D-Day.”

Connor didn’t disappoint. He attacked the marchers with German shepherds and baton-wielding policemen. Connor’s army funneled hundreds of children and teenagers into overcrowded jail cells. Still, the kids returned to the streets the next day. And the day after that. Malcolm X, whom history treats as the movement’s violent alter ego, criticized King for the event, saying that “real men don’t put their children on the firing line.” King, on the other hand, called it “one of the wisest moves we made.”

The Children’s Crusade changed the way the movement was covered by the press. Where the crushing effects of segregated schools hadn’t won hearts, where brutal, state-sanctioned beatings of hymn-singing black men and women hadn’t gained sympathy, the nation couldn’t ignore the images of children recoiling from the raised batons of sneering police officers. Only the most distressing type of violence worked.

Not a fence-sitter or apologist here (yes, maybe a mod shouldn't engage in ad homs, come on!), had my share of activism, though not violence, at least not against living beings. I am just 1. not at all sure that violent tactics will lead to desired results 2. not sure it is the right thing to do anyway. Mostly for me it's about 1., but 2 is also a factor, because people who can be helped will get hurt when the lines between right wing "buffoons" and fascists and neo-Nazis get blurred, when everything becomes so black-and-white, and a fellow like me becomes an apologist ("with us or against us"). For a hammer, everything looks like a nail, and to some of us, sadly, every rightwinger is a Nazi.

Fascists are bad for the world in every way possible. They should be, as Q points out, doxxed, outed, shamed, etc. And if they ever become serious force, they should be opposed with serious force. Why? They don't believe in Democracy and democratic values. They exploit the latter to overthrow the former. In the meantime, I am not going to lose sleep over Antifa showing up and shutting down these fascist pricks. Why? I think it is a good thing that Antifa routes these people.

Second, antifa activists don’t wield anything like the alt-right’s power. White, Christian supremacy has been government policy in the United States for much of American history. Anarchism has not. That’s why there are no statues of Mikhail Bakunin in America’s parks and government buildings. Antifa boasts no equivalent to Steve Bannon, who called his old publication, Breitbart, “the platform for the alt-right,” and now works in the White House. It boasts no equivalent to Attorney General Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, who bears the middle name of a Confederate general and the first name of the Confederacy’s president, and who allegedly called the NAACP “un-American.” It boasts no equivalent to Alex Jones, who Donald Trump praised as “amazing.” Even if antifa’s vision of society were as noxious as the “alt-right’s,” it has vastly less power to make that vision a reality.

Their views are noxious, and in my opinion, are not protected speech when they are brought into the commons. If people wish to have sick Hitlerian fantasies in their double wides and chatrooms, I can't do anything about that. But at least we can keep their hateful speech out of public spaces. And until our legal system catches up with the 21st century, until that time I an glad there is a solid Anti-Fascist movement in this country, just as there was in the 1920's and 30's, when the ugly face of Fascism first reared its head in the world.

OK, let me try it another way. Let's break down the proantifa argument step by step.

1. PP, Proud Boys and the like are fascists or proto-fascists.

I've seen some whacky views expressed by individual members and roguish behavious, but does that mean the whole group can be determined to be fascists, let alone neo-Nazis? Shouldn't the views of the leaders, as well as the entirety of what they put out be considered? Any group will have some loons. And Tiny  apparently assaulting a guy after a heated exchange is adduced as evidence that the groups he belongs to are fascists?? Hmmm...unconvincing, but not the weakest of the bunch.


2. They might be small and insignificant now, but so was NSDAP or its progenitors. And look where that led to.

Argumentum ad Hitlerium. There are so many differences between the US and Weimar Republic, but even this could perhaps hold. It is conceivable that such groups will grow, mutate and attempt to undermine the very democratic order that they currently say they are standing up for. Yes, PP repeatedly say they are big on freedoms, right, etc. Not exactly Mr Hilter and his Munich buddies, but hey, very unlikely but possible.


3. If we don't nip them in the bud, with violence and whatever means necessary, this is what's bound to happen.

This, to me, is by far, the weakest link. It betrays a lack of belief not only in the 1st Amendment but in democracy itself - the power of non-violent action, civic discourse and a fundamental distrust of the voters. The choice is painted as being between antifa violence and non-action. Organising a  powerful grassroots alternative to corrupt pollies and rightwing loons is not on the cards, is it? Winning over people's hearts and minds with coherent and fair policies, better arguments and a sensinble compassionate ideology is just a pipe dream, is it? So it's goodbye democracy then. It is indeed a sad indictment of your society if it's best minds turn to this sort of thinking. It won't take much to undermine the democratic order when it already is so weak. Vigilantes, taking law into your own hands, is all fair game. Next time people turn out to protest Trump like they did in 2016 many refusing to accept the outcome of the democratic election, the Trumpistas can organise and beat the crap out of them, since they judge them to be a danger to society.

“Today cracked 3 skulls open with virtually no damage to myself,” the young man wrote on Aug. 12, 2017.

Vasillios Pistolis had come to the now infamous Unite the Right rally eager for such violence. He belonged to a white supremacist group known as Atomwaffen Division, a secretive neo-Nazi organization whose members say they are preparing for a coming race war in the U.S. In online chats leading up to the rally, Pistolis had been encouraged to be vicious with any counterprotestors, maybe even sodomize someone with a knife. He’d responded by saying he was prepared to kill someone “if shit goes down.”

...

Last year, nearly 25 percent of active-duty service members surveyed by the Military Times said they’d encountered white nationalists within the ranks. The publication polled more than 1,000 service members.

The results are jarring in a number of ways, not least because each branch of the armed forces has regulations that bar service members from joining white supremacist organizations. Army policy, for example, forbids soldiers from participating in “extremist groups” that foster “racial, gender, or ethnic hatred or intolerance.” The Marine Corps has a similar regulation, Order 1900.16, which mandates swift penalties for Marines caught engaging in “extremist or supremacist activities.”

PP, from what I've seen of them, have largely been within their right to peacefully rally, but you don't like what you think they stand for, so you want them bashed and chased off the streets. The thing is, this cuts both ways. You start abridging people's right and your turn will come.
There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been thought to raise any Constitutional problem. These include the lewd and obscene, the profane, the libelous, and the insulting or "fighting" words--those which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. It has been well observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.

A man from Portland, Oregon says he was attacked by a member of the far-right Proud Boys group who has links to a Republican Senate candidate in Washington state.

Tim Ledwith, 34, said he was punched by Tusitala “Tiny” Toese, 22, who is aligned with the Proud Boys, a “western chauvinist” group founded by Gavin McInnes, a co-founder of the Vice Media empire.

Toese is also a prominent member of Vancouver, Washington-based Patriot Prayer, a group that has staged rallies that have often turned violent in the Pacific north-west over the past year. Patriot Prayer is led by Joey Gibson, a Republican candidate in the US Senate primary in Washington.

Ledwith said the attack happened in a busy shopping area in Portland at around 2.30pm on Friday 8 June. Toese and two other men had been yelling at strangers from a truck, he said.

“They were yelling: ‘Support Trump, build the wall,’” Ledwith said.

Ledwith responded with a profanity, he said, and the men stopped their vehicle. Ledwith said Toese and another man, Proud Boys and Patriot Prayer supporter Donovan Flippo, got out.

“They were calling me a faggot and slinging epithets at me,” Ledwith said. “Tiny walked over calmly and … punched me in the face. I’m like, half his size. I was not a threat to them. I’m 34 years old, not 17. This is not a thing that happens to me day-to-day.”

Ledwith said the punch knocked him to the ground and opened a gash in his lip. He was treated at hospital, he said, receiving several stitches.

A witness, who did not wish to be identified, told the Guardian she saw the attack from a block away. Toese, she said, punched Ledwith. Flippo, she said, stood beside Toese but was not physically involved. Ledwith offered no physical provocation, the witness said, and did not respond violently.

Photos showed Ledwith’s injuries and Flippo walking towards the pickup truck, wearing a T-shirt marked “Antifa Removal Service”. The pickup, which carries Washington plates, is registered to Russell Schultz of Vancouver, Washington, a known attendee at Patriot Prayer rallies.

CicadaCanto said:
This is a general question.

Suppose one has a vajra relationship with a teacher (even a group of teachers) and a karmic connection to a cycle of teachings that one has committed to the practice of.

What that might look like is receiving empowerments, instructions and transmissions from a teacher or group of teachers and actively engaging in the practices. Doing the ngondro, accomplishing different practices by numbers or signs, doing certain types of training.

What about taking teachings from another teacher in that context?

My teacher wouldn't really care. As long as I practice purely and hold the lineage teachings.

But having considered this for some time, going and receiving these other teachings, it makes me wonder about my motivation. I have already been given a complete path. It comes down to, in pragmatic terms, whether I wish to receive these other teachings, or engage in retreat on my main practices. There is only so much time and money.

But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant.

We are talking about a movement to the far right in the United States driven by racists and fundamentalist Christians that would make a movement such as the Civil Rights movement impossible without protracted and bloody civil war. (But wait, the history of US politics has always been about slavery, since day one -- that's what the second amendment and the electoral college were designed to protect, slavery, and we already fought a bloody civil war that made MLK and the Civil Rights movement possible.)

Queequeg said:
American fascism will not be really dangerous until there is a purposeful coalition among the cartelists, the deliberate poisoners of public information, and those who stand for the K.K.K. type of demagoguery.
...

Still another danger is represented by those who, paying lip service to democracy and the common welfare, in their insatiable greed for money and the power which money gives, do not hesitate surreptitiously to evade the laws designed to safeguard the public from monopolistic extortion. American fascists of this stamp were clandestinely aligned with their German counterparts before the war, and are even now preparing to resume where they left off, after “the present unpleasantness” ceases:

The symptoms of fascist thinking are colored by environment and adapted to immediate circumstances. But always and everywhere they can be identified by their appeal to prejudice and by the desire to play upon the fears and vanities of different groups in order to gain power. It is no coincidence that the growth of modern tyrants has in every case been heralded by the growth of prejudice. It may be shocking to some people in this country to realize that, without meaning to do so, they hold views in common with Hitler when they preach discrimination against other religious, racial or economic groups. Likewise, many people whose patriotism is their proudest boast play Hitler's game by retailing distrust of our Allies and by giving currency to snide suspicions without foundation in fact.

The American fascists are most easily recognized by their deliberate perversion of truth and fact. Their newspapers and propaganda carefully cultivate every fissure of disunity, every crack in the common front against fascism. They use every opportunity to impugn democracy. They use isolationism as a slogan to conceal their own selfish imperialism...They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest. Their final objective toward which all their deceit is directed is to capture political power so that, using the power of the state and the power of the market simultaneously, they may keep the common man in eternal subjection.

He told me that he was treated by some famous TB doc and was himself very upset by this what happned to him, and was very angry with the doc. After a few years of some other treatment probably WM, he got better.
So I wondered at that time about safety of those TM pills. I have no idea how they are produced etc. and if there is any control over the whole process. I am used to WM and traditional Japanese medicine but only as patient, not an expert. TJM  schools in Japan are under strict control, and there are serious limits for those with a license to have an access to needls, and other medical stuff for safety reasons. How is it with TM docs? and who controls their medications?

There are GMP plants for Tibetan Medicine in China, but these processes make medicine that is much inferior to the quality of handmade Tibetan medicine crafted in small pharmacies. Traditionally, herbs are stone ground, but in these plants, everything has to be made of steel, which adds hrat that destroys the essential oils which are the active ingredient in the herbs. Not only this, but these plants source inferior herbs from lower altitudes. It is a known fact that plants that grow at altitude where there is less oxygen are more mineral rich etc. This is why Himalayan herbs are superior to their lowland counterparts.

It is possible the lama you are referring to was given improperly prepared medicine. The risks of mercury sulfite compounds is well known in Tibetan Medicine and the warnings about misuse and poor preparation of them are quite stern.

Thing is though that Antifa are just childish, whereas these right-wing nuts are plain dangerous.  Mainly because they are armed to the teeth too.

Take the recent Patriot Prayer rally.  Police colluded with the neo-Nazis, allowing them to go to the protest armed (with firearms) while shaking down Antifa counter-protesters and arresting them for possession of non-existent weapons.  They then proceeded to gas and beat the crap out of Antifa while leaving their neo-Nazi mates unperturbed.

In Greece the neo-Nazis used to blow off their pent-up sexual energy beating up migrants (killed a couple) and then one day decided to kill a Greek Antifa (knifed him to death).  Then the Antifa got real serious and raided and shot-up a neo-Nazi gathering killing two people and seriously wounding a third.

It took the arrest of key neo-Nazis to stop an all out urban war happening in Athens.

How long is it going to be before one of these trigger-happy "silly men" or "buffoons" makes the mistake of shooting somebody and starting a civil war?

I remember a short time ago one of them pulled a gun and shot warning rounds in the ground in front of Antifa counter-protesters, so it is not going to be long before something REALLY stupid happens.  And then things will no longer be funny at all...

And the first people to justify what will happen will be these "silly men" and "buffoons" and, of course, every intellectually-challenged American's favorite president...

Leaving aside the super interesting debate about translation, because i bet this translation of tibetan to english is quite bad/incorrect, please in your own voice, based on your own understanding haha, questions:

1) What does truly exist (other than our beloved dependent origination)?  Does the planet earth exist (for 4 billion years so far)?

2) Can something go in and out of existance?  Like the human being sidartha gauthama?

3) is everything an illusion?  If no, what is not an illusion?   Is happiness an illusion?  Fyi in standard english illusion means:
an instance of a wrong or misinterpreted perception of a sensory experience.  So if all of buddha dharma does not exist, if its all an illusion, then is perception as a whole the wrong way to go?

Tibetan is a relatively simple language with a relatively simple grammar. The most difficult thing about it is that it lacks synonyms, so the same words pull multiple duties depending on context.

The point is that the pure aggregates do not cease contra your assertion.

Astus said:
The pure form of the aggregates are present during sopadhisesa-nirvana - that is what the word means - but its other part, nirupadhisesa, means exactly that there is no support (upadhi), i.e. skandhas present. However, Yogacara works discuss the transformed skandhas only for buddhas (Mahayanasutralamkara 9.41-45; Mahayanasamgraha 10.5), but not mentioned for those of the two vehicles. Xuanzang also discusses the issue as https://dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?p=459641#p459641. Also, arhats without nirupadhisesa-nirvana can only fit into the system of ekayana, but not of the five gotras where sravakas and pratyekabuddhas reach a final and definite goal. As Vasubandhu notes in his commentary to the Lotus Sutra (Tiantai Lotus Texts, BDK ed, p 135): "It is not the case that those who have not originally produced the thought of enlightenment, such as ordinary people and the disciples who are fixed [in the Small Vehicle], are able to attain it."

So unless you say that Yogacara does not posit the doctrine of different gotras, arhats and pratyekabuddhas must attain true nirupadhisesa-nirvana.

So, therefore your idea that Yogacara advocates a total cessation for arhat is completely unfounded based on the reasoning you gave, i.e., that there is no continuation upon the cessation of the ālaya.

Astus said:
Why would that be? Just because the alayavijnana ceases for both arhats and buddhas, it does not mean that their attainment is the same. For buddhas there are the causes accumulated over the bodhisattva path to generate the buddha-bodies. But the causes are absent for arhats, hence there is no cause for the emergence of anything.

"Samanantarapratyaya, a condition qua antecedent, means that the eight actual consciousnesses (darsana and samvittibhaga) and their Caittas (to the exclusion of Rupa, the Viprayuktas, the Bijas, and the Asamakrtas) constitute a preceding group which passes away to give place to a subsequent group of the same species, opening the way to that group and acting in such a way that it immediately comes into being. ...
At the moment of entry into Nirupadhisesanirvana (Final-Nirvana-without-residue, i.e., Nirvana without vestiges of reincarnation), the mind is extremely weak and, in consequence, has not 'the strength to open the way and lead'. Further, it does not produce a subsequent dharma of a similar nature. Hence it is not Samanantarapratyaya.
How do you explain this?
It has been truly said in the Yogasastra that 'if, immediately after the former consciousness-associates, the latter consciousness-associates are born, then the former are the Samanantarapratyaya of the latter.' (Yogasastra, 3 and 51, and Vikhyapana, 18)."

In Mahāyāna, it is certainly the case, for example, the Lanka Sutra.

Astus said:
Only those of the undetermined lineage change to the bodhisattva path.

"[The Buddha] has taught a single vehicle to lead word-hearers of undetermined [lineage], other bodhisattvas [of undetermined lineage], and [bodhisattvas] of determined lineage into the Great Vehicle."
(Mahayanasamgraha 10.32, BDK ed, p 115-116)

Here is Xuanzang's explanation on the state of nirupadhisesa-nirvana (Cheng Weishi Lun, book 9, chapter 4, part 5, section 1.2.2, p 761-763, tr Wei Tat):

"The Sravakas and the Pratyekabuddhas, you say, are in possession of the Nirupadhisesa. Is there not a Sutra which teaches that they are not in possession of Nirupadhisesa? If they are in possession, why is it said that they are not?
But the same Sutra [the Srimala Sutra] teaches that they do not in any way possess Nirvana. Is one going to maintain that Sopadhisesa is also lacking in them?
In fact, as long as their 'body and intelligence' (i.e., their body and their mind) remain, the Sravakas and other saints of the two Vehicles - that is to say, the niyatagotras (saints of indeterminate nature) - have Jneyavarana. The duhkhopadhi (that is to say, 'that which serves as support for suffering') not having been exhausted, the principle of Parinirvana remains latent. It may therefore be said that they are not possessed of Nirvana.
This does not mean that they are really devoid of Sopadhisesa Nirvana, that is to say, the 'Reality' or Tathata revealed by the exhaustion of Klesavarana.
But, since they have not yet realized the complete Parinirvana, one says that they have not the Nirupadhisesa: this does not mean that, later, when their body and intelligence have been destroyed, they will not suffer the exhaustion of duhkhopadhi and the resultant Nirupadhisesa Nirvana.
In other words, if the Srimalasutra teaches that the saints of the two Vehicles are not possessed of Nirvana, one should understand that this refers to the fourth Nirvana, i.e., the Apratisthitanirvana, in which the Bodhisattva does not stay or reside, not the first three.
Furthermore, this declaration that the saints of the two Vehicles have not the Nirupadhisesa refers only to the aniyatagotras (saints of indeterminate nature) : these Arhats, at the very moment of their attainment of Sopadhisesa Nirvana, determine to turn their mind towards the supreme Bodhi. By the power of their pure meditation and contemplation and of their pious vows and resolutions, which proceed from compassion, they 'conserve' their bodies and continue their residence for long periods of time in Samsara instead of entering into the Nirupadhisesa as do the niyatagrota saints of the two Vehicles.
The latter, i.e., the niyatagrota saints whose mind is fixed on arhatship, and not on Buddhahood, have a great predilection for Parinirvana. They obtain the contemplation of pudgalasunyata, thus realizing immediately the Bhutatathata which results from this sunyata; they completely destroy the Klesavarana, the cause of rebirth, thereby attaining the Sopadhisesa Nirvana which is revealed on the basis of 'Reality'. The klesas which produce rebirth for these saints having been exhausted, there is no reason for a new existence to be produced, especially when the actual duhkhopadhi (the physical body) comes to perish spontaneously. The other samskrtadharmas (active, functioning dharmas), since they no longer serve as a supporting basis (upadhi), are abandoned at the same time as the duhkhopadhi. As a result of this, the Nirupadhisesa Nirvana which supports itself on Reality will be manifested. Although at this moment (when the duhkhopadhi has come to an end) the body and intelligence of the two Vehicles no longer exist, nevertheless, as these saints have previously effected the destruction of this duhkhopadhi, one can attribute Nirupadhisesa to them.
At this moment, [in view of the complete disappearance of all cittanimitta,] there remains only the pure Tathata (the first of the ten Tathatas set out at the beginning of this section), exempt from the ten nimittas, placid, tranquil, non active, beatified.
From the point of view of Tathata, it is said that the saints of the two Vehicles are not different from the Buddhas; but since they are not possessed of Bodhi and those activities that are directed to the salvation of others, it is said that they are different from the Buddhas."

How will we charge the birds that hear the tinkling bells on the stupa? They are stealing the blessing for free!

How we forget:

"Then Vairocana and Legdrup offered Shri Singha a two pints of gold dust and a finger sized golden ingot and made a request, “The king of Tibet has comprehended the Dharma of cause and result. Since he has send us to seek the Dharma that transcends cause and result, please grant our request for the Dharma beyond cause and effect.”

Lets see, two pints of gold dust costs approximately $40,000 in todays money. Guess those Indian masters were really scandalous...and they had not even received any teachings...

Well, the social and political model of Vajrayāna is the family. Guru and consort are the parents, disciples are the children. One cannot belong to some family simply because one demands admittance.

I think that many people here never experienced real poverty.

To be very clear, I wasn't turned out from the teachings by the teacher in questions, but by an organizer, who is sufficiently well off himself. I didn't even have the option of approaching the teacher directly.

Malcolm wrote:
That is called an obstacle. Your karma.

Nyedrag Yeshe said:
Another important point, I'm willing to pay the whole money, I don't have the actual value just now. I'm willing to offer what I have now, my labor capacity and any skill, plus the actual monetary value as soon as I get it! I'm in no way willing to go on "bargaining" Dharma teachings.

Malcolm wrote:
Apparently, they did not require your services. Would you have been willing to offer them even if no Dharma teachings were forthcoming from your efforts? If so, you should go back, and offer your services to this Dharma center, with no expectations other then merit gained.


Nyedrag Yeshe said:
I also seem that some people here never experienced poverty, in a poor country (in a poorer region within it), where you don't have your own money, and the few you have in our pocket is used for buying your medicine and food for daily survival.

Malcolm wrote:
There are any number of Dharma teachings which I would have liked to attend, but did not for lack of money and merit to go.

Yes, the social situation was entirely different,  What's your point?

I'm not arguing that individuals should not be willing to sacrifice material wealth to encounter Vajrayana, i'm simply stating that there is an institutional and cultural setup, including commodification and bureaucracy, that has very little to do with the traditional stories regarding giving large sums of gold to one's Guru.

Yep, ChNN (as with many things) is deeply generous, and IMO the DC way of allowing people access to the teachings while having a second tier that delivers extra benefits for paying for membership is actually a great model.

It was not always this way, per ChNN's specific instructions. Once the community became more wealthy in general, then he changed his policies. But it used to the case, no cash, no admission. Ask Oldbob.

Lets phrase this a different way:

Do teachers have any obligation to make teachings affordable, or is charging large amounts ok because it keeps out people who don't "want it bad enough'?

Malcolm wrote:
Gurus have no obligation to make teachings available, let alone affordable. This is just not how Vajrayāna works.

Johnny Dangerous said:
I get what you are saying but..

The idea that the cost of teachings is just about a Gurus  will or prerogative alone strikes me as kind of questionable, the cost of teachings often has lots of do with larger administrative questions, especially in large organizations.

Malcolm wrote:
A bit of the study of history is in order here. When translators went to India, they took large amounts of gold with them, took incredible risks to bring the teachings back to Tibet, and so on. The thirteen Golden Dharmas of Sakya are called "Golden" because at one time they cost money in gold, not because they are very nice.

Frankly, these days, students complaining about spending some money for their path of ultimate liberation just sounds like disgruntled bitching.

Malcolm wrote:
The Lung for the 17 tantras (as well as the Vima and Khandro Nyinthigs) still exists and is still transmitted. The 17 tantras themselves and related material are also termas, though considered part of kama, revealed during the two decades prior to Atisha's death, somewhere in the early 1040's.

treehuggingoctopus said:
If I understand you correctly, it means that prior to Atisha's death there were no Dzogchen tantras (in this world) at all?

Malcolm wrote:
You did not understand correctly. The 18 Sem sde lungs are present in Tibet from the late 8th and early 9th century. The Kun byed rgyal po is probably not a translation, but a compilation and expansion of the five sems sde lungs. The rmad du 'byung ba tantra is similar, but ancient. There are many other Dzgchen tantras that were written down in the 9th and 10th century, but dating them is difficult.

Then there is the Brahmin cycle, revealed as terma during the late tenth, early eleventh.

Atisha seems to have passed around 1055. The 17 tantras were revealed 15 or 20 years before this date. According to tradition, the seventeen tantras were concealed in a temple about 30k north of Lhasa by Nyangban Tingzin Zangpo. The oral lineage was passed on separately from the texts. These were reunited when Dangma Lhungyal removed the 17 tantras from their place of concealment. He then passed the texts onto Chetsun Senge Wangchuk around 1065. Senge Wangchuk in turn transmitted them to Chegom Nagpo. Chegom Nagpo transmitted them to Zhangton Tashi Dorje in roughly 1108. Zhangton revealed the Vima Nyinthik when he was 21, in roughly 1118.

According to the Nyingthig history, Atisha attained his realization through practicing Dzogchen, actually.
