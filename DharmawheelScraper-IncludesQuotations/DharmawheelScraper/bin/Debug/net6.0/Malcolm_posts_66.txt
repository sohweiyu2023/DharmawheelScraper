I think that our current political/economic model is based on theft. I think it is a form of exploitation or extortion that we have got so used to that most of us don't even stop to think about it. I believe capitalism is inherently violent: it not only pushes us into war after war, but it's whole value system and praxis is dehumanising and alienating.

Malcolm wrote:
No, resource shortages push us into wars. This will happen under _any_ political or economic system, apart from one run by awakened people (my preferred utopian vision). Therefore, the only obvious solution is to support as many people as possible in becoming awakened. Short of that, it is imperative to encourage worldly people to refrain from the ten non-virtues and to cultivate the four brahma-viharas (love, compassion, joy and equanimity).

Malcolm wrote:
Sorry, I am not guilty and I do not feel guilty. I have not stolen anything from anyone. I _want_ this present system to continue, 1. because markets are a fact of human existence regardless of the currency which is being used 2. because no proposed alternatives are workable or scale internationally.

And TOTO, evolution is all about niches, and we humans are no different, we inhabit the niches we find ourselves whether through karma or struggle to overcome our karma. You keep forgetting that a person who has no karma to be wealthy will never be wealthy even if you given them all the money in the world, they will have obstacles, or it will be robbed from them, or they will behave in such a way with it that they are sure to go to lower realms.

I am all for small scale experiments. If some want to have a anarchist commune, I am in favor of it. If some want to try and run their country or state according to Marxist principles, well, I think they are crazy but let them try. In the case of the former, they will have to deal with the fact that some people naturally are leaders and that a hierarchy will of necessity evolve, and former will have to face the fact that they will inevitably face supply and demand in the market.

While your desire for universal economic parity is admirable, it is romantic and impractical.

What is the reality of the characteristics? Once they are understood, the exaggerated and depreciative views regarding phenomena and persons do not occur. This is what characterizes the reality of the imaginary nature. Nor do the exaggerated and depreciative views of apprehended and apprehender occur, which is what characterizes the reality of the dependent nature. And in the same way, once it is understood, the exaggerated and depreciative views related to existence and non-existence do not occur. This is what characterizes the reality of the thoroughly established nature. Being unmistaken about this fundamental reality is referred to as the “reality of the characteristics.”

Malcolm wrote:
This still refers to the imagined nature viz: reification persons and things is the imagined nature, the absence of subject and object which produces the imagined is the dependent nature, the absence of existence and non-existence of the imagined nature in the dependent nature is the perfected nature. All of these three terms hinge on the imagined nature.

Malcolm wrote:
But the Buddhist view is not actually a verbal construct, and for that matter neither is Buddhist awakening.

For example, one needs only to understand the dependent nature of afflictions to become a stream entrant and so on, becoming free of the fetters. This does not require elaborate philosophy. It merely requires confidence in the teaching of dependent origination and the four truths of nobles.

Likewise, for the realization of emptiness on the path of seeing, one simple has to reflect on the absence of extremes (for a very long time, albeit), as Shantideva states, "when neither an entity or a non-entity remain before the mind, at the time, the mind is pacified", and this too is an experiential view.

In the case of Vajrayāna, the view, such as it is, is based on the experience of the example wisdom at the time of direct introduction or the third and fourth empowerments. Unfettered equipoise in the mind essence, or "ordinary awareness" is the view of Vajrayāna.

So this is why your illustration is irrelevant to Buddhadharma, and why Buddhadharma does not merit inclusion amongst "the blind men".

Malcolm, really.

I think society has changed a great deal. Yes there are many of the same old problems, but many many things have been improved through social action.

I caught a bus the other day in Swansea: two men got on and were snuggling and kissing. No problem. Even forty years ago they would have risked getting beaten up and jailed.
I believe in the USA black and white people can now sit in the same section of the bus and eat in the same restaurants. This sort of thing used to be the exception rather than the rule.

Malcolm wrote:
And before slavery was widespread in the US it was the rule to. And your gay friends still risk getting beaten up. Bias against gay people is not finished by a long shot. And of course racism and xenophobia is rampant in Europe right now. And let's not even mention Russia.

Some things have changed, other things have gotten worse, other things have gotten better. Things are better in our neck of the woods because we are the richest nations on the globe. Handing everyone $56,000 a year is not only impossible, but it won't solve anything.

Oh c'mon. Of course it is a matter of partiality. Unless you are saying that there is a broad consensus on the matter, which as we all know is never the case in Tibetan Dharma, then you are presenting your personal preference with an argument attached. What the possible rebuttals to your argument are I have no idea, but suffice it here to say that there are plenty of qualified khenpos that subscribe to the idea of the 3 natures that are familiar with your objection. The Tibetan system of treating the perfected nature as empty of the dependent and the imagined indeed is based on some very late Indian scholars, but it is not justified in the works of Maitreyanatha, Asanga or Vasubandhu.
As you say it is a later development. There does seem to be a slippery slope effect here regarding the Buddha Nature teachings that is playing out over time. One of the things I admire about the Gelugpas is their insistence on trying to hold the line. I have a mental image of them as being like the little Dutch boy with his finger in the dike, only the entire dike has already collapsed except for the section a couple feet to the right and left of him.

Where this slippery slope ends up is in the Shentong and Chinese non-dual camps. Making too much of an issue out of it at this point is just crying over spilt milk, imo. I think an ecumenical "we will just have to agree to disagree" approach is in order.

Malcolm wrote:
Even Karl Brunholz admits that the three natures as presented by the Tibetan gzhan stong pas does not reflect their use by the original Yogacara masters. The former use what he describes as the type two schema of the three natures, while he fully admits that the latter use a type one schema. The problem arises because the Tibetan gzhan stong pas clearly claim that they are representing the thought of the original Yogacara masters, Maitreyanatha, Asanga and Vasubandhu when in fact they clearly are not, and thus Tsongkhapa, Gorampa, and so on, a whole host of Kagyu, Sakya, Nyingma and Gelug scholars can take them to task for misapplication of this doctrine.

The three natures doctrine is entirely irrelevant to the tathāgatagarbha teachings. It is wholly absent in the ten so called "tathāgatagarbha" sutras as well as the Uttaratantra. The three natures doctrine was grafted onto the tathāgatagarbha doctrine in Tibet because the tathāgatagarbha sūtras are considered "third turning" and the subject of the three natures is covered extensively in the Saṃdhinirmocana sutra, a sūtra of the Yogacara class, which provides us with the locus classicus of the three turnings, but it is so vague as to what is meant by this as to be rather useless, though much stock is placed in it by the gzhan stong pas.

Longchenpa is a perfectly good example of an author who considers the tathāgatagarbha sūtras to be definitive without mixing in the Yogacara three own natures. He also considers Prasangika to be the definitive sutra view.

My problem with the gzhan stong pas is that they do not heed the valid objections of their opponents, and as far as I can tell adhere to their tenet system out of sheer stubbornness rather than reason.

My objection to gzhan stong therefore is primarily an objection to their sloppiness of scholarship.

Then you still wind up with a contradiction because you are claiming that something defined as conditioned is not conditioned.

rob h said:
Isn't that problem there with anything classed as nondual, primordial, one-taste, etc, though? It could be that it's conditioned when the imaginary nature is present, or when it's still attached to, (and also mainly to point out and teach others.) but when it's let go of, it's neither conditioned nor unconditioned, because we're then leaving the realm of logic, and it's then beyond defining. So the whole concept is then let go of once it's served its purpose.

Malcolm wrote:
No, the dependent nature is defined as conditioned. The Mahāyānasaṃgraha states:
Why? If it is asked what is the dependent, since it arises from the seeds of one's traces, given that is the case, it is the conditioned dependent.

Here, one can clearly see the other dependent is the ālayavijñāna.
Then he goes on:
If it is held that whatever appears does not exist in that way, for what reason will the dependent nature not become the total non-existence of everything? If it is asked, if that [dependent nature] does not exist, how will the non-existent perfected nature not become the non-existence of everything? Affliction and purification are perceptible. Therefore, everything is not non-existent. A verse for that:
If the dependent and the perfected
do not exist in every aspect,
affliction and purification
can never exist at all.

So you see, there is an assertion here by Asanga that the ālayavijñāna which is the basis of purification must be an existent in order that the perfected nature can exist; but since one is conditioned and the other is unconditioned, this Yogacara view suffers from a crucial internal contradiction.

The gzhan stong pas seek to escape this contradiction by mapping the three natures over the two truths. But this mapping is not justified in the  Indian texts and in reality harms both systems. So you wind up with a system that is kind of like a tole, a sterile hybrid between a yak and cow, being neither.

Yeah can see how that can be a problem, but maybe it's also an act of pointing to the idea that they're always both present? As in nirvana is also samsara. But by removing the imagined you remove the contradiction, and they're of what you could say, one taste, or nondual. So instead of trying to go from one to the other, instead you can just work on letting the attachment to the imagined go and then the nondual aspect can then arise, appear, return, and so on, in a natural way.

So you could maybe sum it up by saying that the dependent only appears to be conditioned when the imagined is present. Once that's gone, then it's nondual.

it is permanent because it not subject to decay.

It is not gzhan stong. Gzhan stong requires the convoluted misapplication of the three natures to the two truths. In other words, gzhan stong is at worst, a deformed Madhyamaka; at best it is a transitional view between false aspectarian Yogacara and Madhyamaka.

Nothing stated above is inconsistent with the definitive sutras of the second turning of the wheel. The Āryāṣṭasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā:
Kauśika, given that is so, the Tathāgata is not named tathāgata because he attained his own physical body [ātmabhāvaśarīra], but it is because he attained omniscient wisdom that the Tathāgata is called the tathāgata.

Kauśika, whatever the omniscience of the tathāgata arhat samyakbuddha is, this comes from prajñāpāramitā. 

The attainment of the Tathāgatas own physical body arises from prajñāpāramitā and skill in means, and is the support for omniscient wisdom. Relying on such a support [as the prajñāpāramitā] will generate omniscient wisdom, and will also generate the body of a buddha, and will also generate the dharmakāya, and will also generate the sangha.
Thus if one wants to realize the dharmakāya and omniscience, one must rely on prajñāpāramitā.

Also here is a clear usage of "atman" which does not refer to the self, but rather is being used as a reflexive noun.

Rather than a complicated top-down approach to organizing herds and so on, it's better to just let them carry on their traditional lifestyle.

The main adage of libertarianism being: "My freedom stop where other's freedom start" ... would we really need something else to, all together, interfere?
As for capitalism, I may observe that you approach it with a pinch of utopia when you considere that: "... at least it is not authoritarian or totalitarian. Yes, you may be free to starve under this economic system, but at least you are free."

Dear Sonam:

From a Buddhist point of view, all of these utopian visions require one thing in common, i.e., that all people are free from the three afflictions, or at least able to keep them in check. We presently live in the era of the five degenerations where afflictions are rampant. What are the five?

The degeneration of lifespan
The degeneration of the seasons (climate)
The degeneration of afflictions
The degeneration of view (i.e. increased reliance on materialism, like Marxism, anarcho-capitalism, etc.)
The degeneration of decline (declining health, intelligence, and so on)

For this reason I place no hope in any utopian schemes. The present economic system remains the one most accessible of improvement and tuning. Socialism, as envisioned by the 19th and early 20th century firebrands, has proven to be an utter failure. While capitalism is spiritually bereft as well, at least it is not authoritarian or totalitarian. Yes, you may be free to starve under this economic system, but at least you are free.

No one has the authority to modify the pratimokṣa rules. That's why it was never done, even when the Buddha stated the minor prātimokṣa rules could be ignored.


The sangha has the right to modify the Vinaya as they see fit. In practice this actually happened in India, though perhaps unannounced. The proof for this is found in the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya which contains some Mahāyāna allusions and elements, which means there was significant revising of the content long after the development of the other Vinaya texts.

No, not in the context of East Asia for the simple reason that karma proceedings were not carried out in the Sinosphere.

There are two types of schism: karma-bheda and cakra-bheda. The former was not possible in the Sinosphere. The alternative model proposed does not constitute the latter.

A Sanghabheda requires merely that some fully ordained monk declares he has a better idea than the Buddha, and sets up a new rule.

No one has the authority to do that. This is why bhikṣus of one ordination lineage are barred from reciting posadha with bhikṣus from another ordination lineage. Changing the pratimokṣa rules is a Sanghabheda offense.
At some point somebody changed the original rules otherwise there would not be multiple ordination lineages.

Malcolm wrote:
No, different people received their ordinations at different points in Buddha's lifetime, and began ordaining other monks in regions removed from the Buddha's immediate presence. This is sufficient to account for disparities in the number of rules as well as their language, and accounts of their elaboration.

The Chan "Pure Rules" and Tendai model worked fairly well however.

Prātimokṣa precepts like the five precepts which come with the refuge vows are not the Vinaya. You cannot equate refuge precepts and the five precepts with the Vinaya. The Vinaya prātimokṣa was only provisionally established given the circumstances of the time. The Vinaya is not universal.

Malcolm wrote:
They are prātimokṣa, Vinaya exists to explicate the prātimokṣa in detail. While different ordination lineages have different Vinayas, nevertheless, when you take bhikṣu ordination, you are pledging to hold all the prātimokṣa vows you received, not merely the one's that suit you.

Indrajala said:
Not so. The sangha officially condoned the reform, which is in line with the Vinaya regulations which permit modifications where necessary.

Malcolm wrote:
No one has the authority to modify the pratimokṣa rules. That's why it was never done, even when the Buddha stated the minor prātimokṣa rules could be ignored. When you take bhikṣu ordination, you agree to follow all of the rules, not merely some of the rules, based on your own judgment. For this reason there is posada, to repair any breach of the rules and confess those you have broken. People who are not ready to follow all of the prātimokṣa rules, i.e. Vinaya, should not become bhikṣus.

Indrajala said:
Of course the bodhisattva samvara is "superior" to pratimokṣa vows; nevertheless they cannot be received without first going for refuge, and the receipt of the upāsakā vows is an automatic consequence of going for refuge whether it is first done in a Mahāyāna based rite of conferring the Bodhisattva trainings or not.

This is strictly speaking an orthodox Vinaya view, which is valid within the context of Śrāvakayāna. That being said it does not apply to the Japanese sangha because the sangha council in the early Heian period approved Saichō's reforms whereby a renunciate bodhisattva received alternative precepts based on bodhisattva precepts which granted him the status of a bhikṣu.

You don't seem to know about or appreciate the fact that a celibate and orderly monastic model based on bodhisattva precepts was devised by Saichō and approved by the Vinaya-based sangha authorities in ancient Japan, thereby making it a valid and quite legitimate reform.

I am quite aware of it, for a great deal longer than you, actually [1988]. I don't regard it as valid. As I said such "monks" are celibate upāsakās in robes, no matter how realized, venerable or sublime they may be.

If you will recall, this position is what caused the Zen people to freak out on me. I still have not changed my position.

And as far as I am concerned, someone who actually goes to the trouble of receiving the vows of a śramaṇera or a bhikṣu is obliged to follow them as perfectly as they can without making excuses for not following them as strictly as possible. Otherwise, in my view, they are frauds taking advantage of the robes. Since the ordained Sangha can't seem to keep themselves honest, it is up the lay Sangha to do so by not supporting those ordained people who do not seem to be observing their vows properly.

In a predominately Mahāyāna society, the bodhisattva precepts take precedence over anything Hīnayāna, including the Vinaya. Consequently, implementing new precepts and procedures was warranted and acceptable even based on Vinaya law.

Malcolm wrote:
Prātimokṣa vows are the basis of bodhisattva vows. Without one, you cannot have the other. A person who follows upāsakā prātimokṣa and bodhisattva vows is still just an upāsakā. A person who follows śramaṇera prātimokṣa is still just a śramaṇera.

While it is true that receiving bodhisattva vows changes the nature of one's prātimokṣa, i.e., one is now adhering to these vows as a form of bodhisattva activity, it does not mean that one can be sloppy with them and just ignore them when convenient.

There is a great deal of Indian writing, as well as Tibetan writing on the subject of the three vows.

In general, however, it is only when a prātimokṣa vows contradict bodhisattva vows that one is to favor the latter over the former. But what is the criteria for that contradiction? In general it only covers activity that one is truly engaged in for the welfare of others.

Since a great many of the pratimokṣa rules were set down because of the complaints of laypeople about the conduct of monks, the main point is that śramaṇeras and bhikṣus and their female counterparts need to consider how they appear to lay people. When śramaṇeras or bhikṣus opines in public that their vows are not important, this leaves a very bad impression on lay people, and causes lay people to suspect (correctly) that the Sangha is degenerate and no longer worthy of respect (and so it seem to me). If one claims that only Mahāyāna vows important, than wearing robes truly is a farce, since Mahāyāna vows are the same whether one is a lay person or an ordained person.

By the way, there is nothing more new age that suggesting that prātimokṣa can be discarded.

Okay, I read the Bhasya and it's more or less saying the same thing as you were. Again, the issue is that the Sarvastivādans did not deny that there are also cetanās related to taking the vow, so the theory being posited by Vasubandhu isn't denied. Also, that it cannot be destroyed since it is a dharma that always exists is just to take unfair advantage of the Sarvastivādan position, of course they posit that conventionally speaking it is destroyed. Imaginary? Maybe, how can we know? It's talking about a state that is non-falsifiable, I wouldn't disagree if you were to say it's meaningless - which isn't Vasubandhu's argument. But like I said before, the fact that indictative dharmas are not being denied as at play is more useful, and the notion of avijñapti might simply be one's impression of how things are, hence a vitarka/vikalpa.

The point is, the state of being a monk, be it either a continuous stream of karmas from intention, or an actual non-informative form, is more than irrational fears of Marmite.

Malcolm wrote:
There are also arguments against avijñāpti when Vasubandhu covers the eleven forms of matter in chapter one.

Even if that statehood is not informative.

But,  the notion of monkhood that does away with Avijñapti Rūpa, as you related, is sufficient and more relevant to questions of value judgements about the wholesomeness and fruitfulness of the state.

No, Vasubandhu says that as long as the series is not interrupted by a contrary intention, the vow is maintained. For example, if you have taken the vow not to take life, that vow is intact in the mind stream until you decide you want to kill something. Then you lose the vow because your intention is contrary to the intention that formed the vow. But you do not need to be mindful of that vow in some persistent sense constantly reminding yourself that you have the vow. It is sufficient that you took it, and when a situation comes up that demands you either follow the vow or break it, in a person of predominately positive mental factors, the vow will be followed automatically. The Sautrantika theory is very much grounded on the notion of vasanas. The longer you do not violate the initial intent of a vow, the stronger the trace to maintain that vow is. Of course, in the beginning, that trace will be quite weak, and therefore, more active mindfulness may be required. Eventually however, mindfulness and attentiveness (saṃprajāna) become ingrained, and one is called "well trained".

Im sorry Virgo, I'm trying to stay out of these conversations, but what you are saying here is bullshit. There are several documented instances of US soldiers comitting war crimes in Iraq and Afghanistan. A famous example was the video leaked by Bradley Manning. US marines are people trained to kill, and while US marines might be more disciplined than some of their enemies, there is no innocence in war.

Edit - Don't forget Abu Ghraib either.


Malcolm wrote:
Soldiers have rules of engagement. When those are violated, the soldiers are generally punished. Sometimes soldiers violate rules of engagement out of frustration, when caught, they are punished.

In the Manning video, the gun crew asked their CC for permission to fire. It was granted. It was not, from the US Military or US's point of view, an illegal killing. That is was a total mistake is a fact, that noncombatants were brutally killed by the US Army is a fact. Is there any legal remedy, maybe in a court of international law, but the soldiers followed proper procedures. Are the procedures themselves flawed, certainly. But then we had no business in Iraq anyway.

Abhu Ghraib has resulted in some court martials and convictions, but none were sever enough in my opinion. War is hell.

Again, nonsense. The divorce rate rose in the seventies because most people married in the 60's in their early 20's. This set a precedent that continues unabated.

There is no historical precedent for this sort of thing. Gay marriage allows same-sex parents to raise children. Again, there is no historical precedent for such arrangements and it remains to be seen what this will eventually bring in western societies.

Malcolm wrote:
Having known many children of same-sex couples, all that I have met are heterosexual in orientation, though I am sure there are children of same sex couples who themselves are also gay, I just haven't met any.  Since gay couples actually want children and often have to jump through high hoops to have them, they are generally much more loving and supportive as a whole population than heterosexual parents are. So, my experience with the children of same sex couples is that they do extremely well in school, are highly motivated to succeed, and are well loved and turn out to be fantastic people with few problems. So what down side can there be? Added to this, same sex couples who want kids are themselves usually in good relationships and are professionally successful.

Marriage is just a business contract. Gender orientation and marriage are not coterminous. There are many gay men and women for example in history who have married for the social protections such arrangements offered. Now gay persons can marry people of their own orientation. There is no justifiable argument that can be produced which can show that gay marriage is disadvantageous to society as a whole. People who make such arguments are like those who argued against "miscegenation". In other words, they are bigots seeking intellectual justification for their bigotry.

Is eliminating their use a desiderata? Certainly. Does our world ecology demand it, certainly. Can we do so immediately and globally? No, our addiction to fossil fuels is so deep, that it is impossible for us to withdraw from fossil fuels at this time.

Just because somebody consents that does not mean they aren't being exploited. It really depends on what their other options are. In an extremelly unequal society, 'consent' doesn't add up to much.

Markets requires sound regulations in order to keep them stable and functioning. Among those regulations may indeed be wage guarantees so that people without skills may at least make a living wage, but no more than that. We have seen in this country what happens to industries when the unions get a stranglehold on them: they become moribund, eventually sicken and then die.

Historically Lho Ontul Rinpoche entered the Drikung Kagyu lineage in the 19th century as the older brother of Lho Nuden Dorje. But Achi Chkyi Drolma is also practiced in other lineages such as in Dujom Rinpoche's tradition. At the Khenpo brothers center in New York State her image can be seen.

In this practice Achi Chokyi Drolma can be practiced as the Lama, Yidam, Dakini, or protector. It is supplemented by many different useful concise practices. The previous H.E.

Just wanted to clarify that Ganor Rinpoche is Nyingma and not part of the Drikung Kagyu Lineage. He is a Terton that has revealed a number of practices including a Vajrakilaya cycle. I do not know if he revealed an Achi Terma, but he did have a vision of Achi Chokyi Drolma that revealed to him that Lho Ontul Rinpoche's son, Ratna Rinpoche, was the Quality emanation of the Drikung Terton Lho Nuden Dorje. Historically Lho Ontul Rinpoche entered the Drikung Kagyu lineage in the 19th century as the older brother of Lho Nuden Dorje. 

Achi Chkyi Drolma is also practiced in other lineages such as in Dujom Rinpoche's tradition. At the Khenpo brothers center in New York State her image can be seen. One of her emanations is said to be  Yeshe Tsogyal. The late  Khenpo Jigme Phuntsok, when visiting Terdrom where the Yangzab Terma was revealed, had a vision of a wrathful form of Achi Chokyi Drolma and composed a praise to her.

And one of Jigme Lingpa's main practices was a different terma revealed by both Gyalwang Rinchen Phuntsog as well as his root student Sherab Ozer. I imagine that Jigme Lingpa could have very well received the Yangzab.

Malcolm wrote:
He did.


Drikung_Dzogchen said:
Jigme Lingpa was devoted enough to Gyalwang Rinchen Phuntsog that he composed a short Namthar (life story) of his Rinchen Phuntsogs life. So I could be wrong but the Yangzab could be the first concise Nyingtig cycle based on the Nyingtig Yabshi, in particular the Khandro Nyingtig.

Malcolm wrote:
That distinction goes to Ratna Lingpa.

Drikung_Dzogchen said:
The Yangzab contains everything necessary to traverse all the stages of Dzogchen practice. And yes it does have quite a few Wrathful practices but they are not the heart of the terma. We have to remember just how chaotic the 16th century was in Tibet. Gyalwang Rinchen Phuntsog who was equally a fully accomplished practitioner of Mahamudra and the traditional Drikung Kagyu teachings marks a turning point in the Drikung Kagyu lineage. He chose (in his Namthar was called by the Dakinis) to step down as the head of the Drikung Kagyu lineage and go to the mountains above Terdrom where he engaged in extensive retreat and revealed the Yangzab Terma. During this time period the Karma Kagyu and the Drikung Kagyu allied themselves against Ganden and went to war which proved to be a disaster for both lineages, Ganden prevailed. Though Gyalwang Rinchen Phuntsog was not involved in this war he undoubtedly had many enemies who wished him dead. Some of these enemies probably were from within the Drikung Kagyu lineage who help prejudices against the Nyingma teachings. So these wrathful practices were probably very necessary for the times he lived in. But though the Yangzab Terma cannot said to be the most popular cycle, that really matters very little. It has been maintained up to the present time. Gyalwang Rinchen Phuntsog transcended any type of sectarian lineage labels. He really is an early example of the Rime tradition. His root student Sherab Ozer who before meeting Rinchen Phuntsog was trained in the Sakya tradition, and possibly the Gelugpa to some degree. But more importantly he composed what may be the first Rime text outlining how all the lineages fit together as a whole and embody the Buddha's teachings without conflict. The great jamgon Kongtrul Rinpoche of the 19th century who brought the Rime movement to full bloom references this text by Sherab Ozer. There is still much research to be done but there are many interesting questions here regarding these various connections. I would be interested in anyone's input as my knowledge is more limited. But I will finish with the following. Gyalwang Rinchen Phuntsog played a major (and not always acknowledged role) in shaping the Drikung Lineage down to the present time. Dudjom Rinpoche said that Rinchen Phuntsog helped save the Nyingma lineage when it was persecuted by the Gelugpa and certain transmissions were in danger of being broken. Rinchen Phuntsog transmitted the Nyingtig Yabshi as well as many other Nyingma transmissions to Lamas who would go on to be very important in upholding the Nyingma lineage. Also Rinchen Phuntsogs's son who was a throne holder of the Drikung lineage was the father to five Tulkus, two of which were the first HH Drikung Kyabgon Chetsang and the first HH Drikung Kyabgon Chutsang. From this time on the Drikung lineage would be led reincarnations of these two HH Drikung Kyabgon tulkus.The first HH Drikung Kyabgon Chutsang who is also known as Rigzen Chokyi Dragpa was said to be the reincarnation of Rinchen Phuntsog. His collected works comprise of about 15 volumes. He composed numerous Yangzab sadhanas based on the root Terma texts revealed by Rinchen Phuntsog making the practices clearer. The Shinje or Yamantaka practice which is very special to the Drikung Kagyu lineage entered the lineage through Rinchen Phuntsog. Rigzen Chokyi Dragpa or the first HH Drikung Kyabgon Chutsang had numerous Shinje pure visions which then became the Shinje Drubchen that is practiced down to the current day. So I know I have gone on into many different topics than what I started with but I welcome input or corrections and hope my ramblings are of some benefit.

It means that according to Madhyamaka there are two so called ultimates, one is nominal, the other is the direct perception of emptiness.

But from a Dzogchen point of view, since all relative truths are objects of false cognitions, even the cognition of the nominal ultimate is faulty. The only thing that is true is the cognition of dharmatā. That most certainly requires some kind of direct introduction which is lacking in Sutra teachings. The main advantage to Vajrayāna teachings is that dharmatā or the example wisdom, is introduced during the time of empowerment. In the case of gsar ma, it is the introduction of bliss and emptiness at the time of the third and fourth empowerments; in the case of the Dzogchen it is the introduction of the potentiality of vidyā during anyone of the four styles of empowerment, elaborate, unelaborate and so on.

US foreign debt is 5.6 trillion as of 1/1/13.

If you look, you will see most of debt is held by Other (29.3%) China (22.5%) and Japan (19.0%), in descending order.

China and Japan are heavily dependent on us to buy their imports. So, I don't really see this as a problem for us. The total external debt however is preposterous: 17,344,649,888,998 i.e. 17.3 trillion dollars. Followed by the UK and 10 trillion, followed by France and Germany, and so on. However, of the US debt, 12 trillion is held by Americans. So we are in no danger.

Point 4) The Affordable Care Act is meant to address that through the market. I think it is a bad idea, personally, and support Universal Health Care, but it seems the majority of Americans still cling to the illusion of market choices where their health care is concerned rather than understanding that health care, even if private, should be a regulated monopoly like any other utility.

Further, Dzogchen rejects the two truths, because relative "truth" is not true, being a deluded cognition. But Dzogchen does not reject appearances which appear to ignorance (ma rig pa).

Dzogchen substitutes vidyā and āvidyā (rig pa and ma rig pa) for the term "pāramārtha satya" and "samvṛitti satya".

Also one will discover that Dzogchen, in rejecting the two truths, also rejects ultimate truth, as it states in The Mind Mirror of Samantabhadra:
Since there is no ultimate, also the name “relative” does not exist.
And as it says in Soaring Great Garuda:
Since phenomena and nonphenomena have always been merged and are inseparable,
there is no further need to explain an “ultimate phenomenon”.
So not only is the relative negated in Dzogchen, so is any concept of ultimate.

This is very consistent, for example, with the recommendations found in the Ratnavali and so on. I think he also recognizes that a free market economy provides opportunities that are not possible in a planned economy. Free markets spur more than mere exchange of goods. They also spur creativity, for better or for worse.

My perspective is that in an ideal society there is a balance struck between a market economy, providing minimum support needed for citizens (health care, emergency relief, infrastructure) and the ecosystem, with the ecosystem being a dominant consideration. In other words, if a particular market has a particularly negative impact on the ecosystem, it should be be tightly regulated, etc.

Capitalism was a term coined by Marx. Prior to Marx, no one ever called themselves a "Capitalist". After Marx, people used the term to describe the economic system we still have at present. But it is not and never was a coherent political system.  People started calling Smith's thought "Capitalism" because it was his economic thought and policy suggestions in Wealth of Nations that Marx was largely critiquing.

An argument may be made that political and economic systems are mutually dependent, and it is certainly true that as the US is a product of the Scottish Enlightenment, its political values upon which our style of democracy was founded include such items as ownership of private property, "free" markets, etc. These are enshrined in the BIll of Rights, the fifth amendment of which reads:

No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.

This is of course why Americans by and large are hostile to socialism and communism, because both systems suggest that people do not have a right to private property.

What I get is that in the Sakya the intellectual view is introduced/utilized at some point in tantric practice.

Malcolm wrote:
In Sakya, the intellectual view is introduced prior to tantric practice, in the three visions section. In Vajrayāna, the experiential view is introduced in the empowerment, and confirmed through a precise system of meditating on various examples.



smcj said:
The first part of the sentence seems to agree with my prior post about sutra Mahamudra. The second part of the sentence starting with what I underlined I think indicates that intellectual view is incorporated into deity practice--at least in the Sakya.

Malcolm wrote:
No, it is not. What is incorporated into deity practice is the experiential view which comes from empowerment and is stabilized by the unique approach found in Sakya called "meditating the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana".

About a month ago there was a thread on Buddhism and politics at our sister site. This is how I responded:

Some of my thoughts on different political systems / economies:

Communism - A great, noble effort; promotes egalitarianism, least amount of poverty, hunger, disparities in wealth and income -- in theory. In practice, it doesn't work well. People find ways around not being allowed private property and wealth. Where there's a will, there's a way and there was always a vast underground market in every communist nation. It is also totalitarian and a poor economic system which did not alleviate poverty for the masses as it was implemented.

Capitalism - worked okay in some instances as long as it remained at the Adam Smith free market level. As it progresses to a larger more complex society, it evolves to corporatism where the government favors certain industries and businesses over others, essentially abandoning its roots. Corruption becomes rampant and politicians are bought off. You get the military-industrial-complex, the prison-industrial-complex, among others.

Monarchies, autocracies, timocracies, and other oligarchies - totalitarian, usually hereditary, not surprising that most nations have gone away from these.

Democracy - "two wolves and a lamb voting on what's for lunch" (rule by the tyranny of the majority)

Plato's Republic I always thought sounded pretty reasonable since it is based on meritocracy. Why not have political leaders who actually know a little something? But how to implement it and choose the philosopher kings [leaders]?

In the end, I guess we're stuck with democracy and to make it the most useful and effective, have some balance between socialism and capitalism. The most successful nations in terms of least poverty and warfare appear to be those with a good mix, including the Scandinavian nations and those in Western Europe.

I see there is other interest here too in meritocracy. I think Plato's Republic would meet this principle, but how to implement it? We seem stuck in democracy but as we know this is tyranny too; a tyranny of the majority and we have seen what that can do. I don't think the Buddha would like principles being thrown out the window in the name of [democratic] compromise either. So Plato's Republic / wheel-turning monarch would be ideal but the implementation would be difficult, if not impossible.

Well, if you define it in this way, there are almost no capitalists anymore. There are very few people who work for persons who own a factory. For the most part, corporate ownership is collective. What you are saying is that apart from the board and major stockholders, everyone else, from the CEO on down are proletariats because they do not own the means of production, and sell their labor for what they can get.

By contrast, in the nineteenth century, for the most part factories, railroads and so on were own by private persons and families, etc.

So tsongkhapa is the origin of the Tibetan notion that awakening is dependent on correctly assembling an intellectual jigsaw puzzle?

Tsongkhapafan said:
I don't think so, I doubt it.

Regarding views, if there is no correct view, there is no object of meditation and if there is no correct object of meditation, we cannot gain inner experience that pacifies delusions. All problems are caused by wrong view, so I can't agree with your dismissal of correct views which are the only antidote.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct view in Vajrayāna arises from the empowerment. This is the reason why in Lamdre, for example, one meditates the view only _after_ having received the cause empowerment where it is introduced in the section of the ālaya cause continuum (tantra) among the three tantras (cause, path and result).

Despite this, of course one also meditates a sutrayāna view using śamatha and vipaśyāna (supplemented by citations from the Mahāsiddhas) at the time of the vision of experience teachings from among the three visions (impure, experiential and pure). Frankly, despite polemics between Sakya and Kagyu over the issue of sutra mahāmudra, meditating the view here is not so different than sutra mahāmudra save only the name.

This argument that you have that capitalism doesn't really exist is just a way of equating the classes under capitalism  with rich and poor or with status, spiritual or otherwise. Although these things can co-occur to an extent they mean different things.

Ok, but you are using a very narrow definition of "class". It is like claiming that out of the ten definitions of Dharma there is only one valid one.

Both 'types' of class system can co-occur and overlap as one type of society transforms into another. This is a dialectical process. No doubt the lower caste Indians will also find themselves in a lower class in the capitalist structure, but they are two different frameworks.

Ideally it would be a meritocracy. The most spiritually advanced in the group is given near absolute authority. People stay in the collective as long as they wish. The mission obviously transcends members personal desires. The leader need not be an expert in everything. They delegate. Their main job is to purify motivation and justify the use of resources.

The game of modern politics is about selfish elites retaining undeserved wealth and power. There is no middle way of exploitation and coercion. The Buddha's life choices seem to support this thesis. You might as well be talking about Buddhist methods of warfare.

For those interested, the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy has a good article on http://www.iep.utm.edu/polphil/. It might be a good way to provide some basis for getting everyone on the same page. To quote one paragraph: Political philosophy has its beginnings in ethics: in questions such as what kind of life is the good life for human beings. Since people are by nature sociable – there being few proper anchorites who turn from society to live alone – the question follows as to what kind of life is proper for a person amongst people. The philosophical discourses concerning politics thus develop, broaden and flow from their ethical underpinnings.
Is there a middle-way ethics?

I was not really talking so much about the role of leaders in politics, but of course this is an understandable inference. What I am really trying to get at is a means of discovering a Buddhist political sensibility which is informed by Buddha's teachings, but can be applied in how we conduct ourselves in political matters.

For example, the Buddha's original middle way was a path between indulgence and asceticism. So the real question is, "How do we Buddhists walk this path in whatever political situation we find ourselves in". That is what I mean by "MIddle Way Politics". TKfan has the right idea, this is not so much about applying political remedies as a party, but what kind of political choices we make in light of our understanding of the Buddha's teaching, based on our own personal transformation dependent on our being people who live in a "polis", who are part of a "polity". So in that case, Adamantine's question about use of force is not an issue. Obviously a key point of a middle way politic would have to include ahimsa as a guiding principle.

It is very simple really: people, when in post-equipoise, resume intellectual analysis of emptiness. One could say that the only persons in whom the equipoise view and the post-equipoise view are "identical" are fully awakened buddhas since in fact they are never not in a state of equipoise.

Sherab said:
Post-equipoise, there is a resumption of intellectual analysis of emptiness.  However, wouldn't post-equipoise intellectual analysis of emptiness be informed by the experience of equipoise?  If yes, then variation in intellectual output would imply variation in the equipoise experienced.  That would mean differences in the experiences of the third and fourth empowerment.

If not, is there then no memory of the experience of equipoise?

Actually, the way I understand is that one's post equipoise view will be characterized by one's remaining knowledge obscuration. Supposing that Nāgārjuna, Āsanga and Candra for example were all bodhisattvas on the stages, their differences in views could be accounted for merely by this fact alone.

I think it's relative depending on time, place, and circumstance..but basically one would try to help all beings achieve a state of less suffering (the suffering of suffering to be specific, since political change  and the material change it brings can't do anything at all to salve the other two), with a minimum of coercion, while encouraging both participation (and a "right" and obligation to participation in that sense), and some sense of responsibility. In addition, instead of politics based on "inherent rights" of really existing beings..I wonder if the model would not be drawn from the acknowledgment of interdependence.

I think you could make a valid argument for a number of different directions, but I think that Anarchism/Libertarian leaning ideas (on the left and right, though personally I am solidly left of center) will be a more natural fit than either statist, or statist/corporatist combinations.

If I had to pick a current party from my personal point of view, I would say to me The Green Party and similar groups are at least vaguely pointed in the right direction, simply due to advocay of things like smaller scale, cooperative tackling of problems.. even if the parties themselves are pretty lackluster right now. In Europe, it seems that democratic socialist ideals (at least on paper) fit the bill, though I gather there are plenty of complaints in practice.

However, a big part of "Dharma politics" would hopefully be honesty about what is, and is not possible, which puts it out of the running...lol.

Apparently they are not allowed to wear a robe that is perfectly clean, there must be some sort of mark on it. It reminds me of the Islamic carpet makers that always put a deliberate mistake in their carpet designs.
The humility of such an act is a valuable way of remembering our 'pride' when we start to think we are perfect, or have nice clothes etc. So these instructions can go very deep and work on all sorts of different levels, not just a literal practical level. I suppose this comes about through practice and may not be self-evident from simply studying the 'rules' from an abstract, uninvolved perspective.

If someone is a Vajrayāna practitioner, I don't really think it matters much which post-equipoise view of emptiness they hold all that much, whether it is the "Prasanga" of the Gelugs, the view of freedom from extremes, or "gzhan stong". The view meditated in Vajrayāna depends on the experience of the third and fourth empowerments and not intellectual analysis.

I think there is a lot of wisdom in his words. But we have to have some caution too. There is a lot of general good advice here that is generally applicable, but some of the advice was particular to the person he was talking to and the time and situation he was talking about. He was a great philosopher and practitioner, but as Buddhists we don't accept anything as 'god given' absolute truth for all time.
Buddhism isn't a 'revealed' religion and Nagarjuna wasn't a prophet. So we can learn from Nagarjuna and all the great teachers, but we have to think and find out for ourselves too. Every day is a new day, and we can't be bound by a formulaic approach to anything.
My own teacher, Lama Rabsang (Palpung), says the Buddha gave 84'000 teachings, meaning that there are lots of ways of approaching practice, and life. For me, it is important to always keep this in mind when approaching any teachings, scripture, or teachers. It's just good sense.
I think the same must apply to engaged Buddhism.

I believe that Malcolm has the kind of expertise that could argue either side of the issue effectively if he wanted to. For personal reasons he chooses to subscribe to non-Gelug Madhyamaka. That's perfectly ok, but just know that he has a strong bias and doesn't always identify it as such.

To be honest I don't really think about those that much either, but I do think the eight consciousness model works well, even if it isn't perfect and is just a concept that eventually has to be dropped with the others eventually.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, the eight consciousness model is also critiqued by Madhyamakas, and indeed Śantarakṣita does not address it much, as far as I recall.

There are basically three trends in scholastic thinking about the five treatises in Tibet: one, that they are all definitive [gzhans stong]; two, that of the five, only the Abhisamyālaṃkara can be considered definitive dge lugs]; three, that Abhisamyālaṃkara is definitive, and that properly understood, the Uttaratantra is definitive; the rest are not.

Then there is my unique point of view, which I have often stated. Asanga's teacher, Ācarya Maitreyanath's own point of view is Yogacara (cittamatra) and his identity as Bodhisattva Maitreya is a Tibetan misattribution that has gained such wide currency as to have become a "fact". He wrote five texts in order to clarify the three mains streams of Mahāyāna sutras. For Prajñānpāramitā he composed the Abhisamyālaṃkara in order to detail its path structure. For the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras he composed the Uttaratantra. And for Yogacara he composed Madhyantavibhanga, being an attempt to correct a perceived Madhyamaka extremism, and the Dharmadharmatāvibhanga, being a detailed treatment of the topic found in the Samdhinirmocana. He composed a treatise synthesizing these three sūtra streams from a Yogacara prespective, the Mahāyānasūtrālaṃkara.

These things should be both communally owned and communally managed democratically.

One of the things that is nice about the US is that things are not centralized to the degree you imagine by "capitalists".

All the roads in the US are maintained in this order buy the states and by the towns or counties.

In many places in the US utilities are in fact owned by the municipality, in other places they are not, where in fact they operate as tightly regulated monopolies.

In every city in the US, water treatment is something run by the local communities.

The rail system in the US, while originally built with private capital in the 19th century, is a now mostly a joint venture between the Feds and what remains of the rail companies that went bankrupt in the 1960's. There do remain a couple of rail systems that continue to operate independently of Amtrak.

In my view, the single biggest financial experiment that went wrong in the US was the dissolution of the long established barriers between savings and loans banks and investment banking in 1999, as well as the increase in credit offerings by the credit card companies and banks in the 1980's. Encouraging people to go into debt is short sighted economic policy. The same thing is now happening in China.

When it comes to financial markets, the main issue is how to insulate the whole of the economy against speculative risk while permitting those who wish to use their money in risk laden ventures. We ought to have learned our lesson in the 1929, but we didn't.

I strongly disagree with you that factories and so on should be "communalized" by force. Anyway, in the US it will never happen. If other countries want to experiment with such socialist remedies, more power to them, but I think that history has shown that such experiments are doomed to failure.

I do believe however that the 1819 Supreme Court Decision on Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward should be reversed, or legislated out of existence. Obviously, corporations are not persons and should not be treated as such. This ruling is actually the seed of neoliberalism (which I am opposed to, of course). Naturally, I think the EU, a neoliberal experiment, should be dissolved. Britain was absolutely correct to keep its distance and currency, and in fact it should never have joined at all.

I think at base, Toto, what we have here is just a cultural difference, in addition, I do not think you have understood Buddhism really very clearly. Nor have you understood the POV of HHDL very clearly. Much is made of his preference for socialism. However, he recently wrote, in his 2009 book, The Leader's Way:

I have come to put my faith in the free-market system.... The fact that it allows for freedom and diversity of thought and religion has convinced me that it is the one we should be working from," he wrote.

He argues in this book that capitalists can learn from Buddhism. But I am sure it surprises you to learn that he supports open markets.

I do not support your view again that the wealth of the ultra rich should be seized, because such a seizure itself would involve catastrophic international conflicts, and because such people have the means to simply remove themselves from your reach. In other words, more harm than good would arise from their temporary (seriously, what's forty years?) control of such wealth. So lets say you do give everyone in the world $49,000 [233 trillion / by world population]. How are you planning to do this? Actually you aren't. You are going to completely disrupt the economy and destroy everyone's wealth, just like the Bolsheviks did in Russia. Honestly, on this score, I think you are completely naive. But lets say we did, the same thing would happen all over again; some people, most people will squander their wealth, some people will be better at managing it, and eventually the same disparities that have arisen will just arise again.

The socialist democracies that Kirt is so fond of are a kind of rapprochement between a moderate (non-marxist) socialist view and the market economy we live in. However, they are only feasible because they are floating in a sea of money.

I guess the point is, I am not opposed to strict market regulation, it is necessary actually for a whole host of environmental reasons and social reasons. But what I am totally opposed to is the idea that we try to abolish the market economy we have now, because another one, a black one, will just take its place.

Anyway, I really don't think your revolution is ever going to happen anyway. The way global wealth is distributed, you would have to have a revolution in the US first, and that will never happen until we have a poverty crisis. Americans are completely allergic to communism.

You don't seem to have any idea what the eighteen qualities of a precious human birth are, even though you are British and a Buddhist. You should maximize your precious human birth and practice Dharma, not waste all your time on obsolete political religions.

You seem to have abandoned your Karmic view that the wealthy got rich via meritorious former lives? Now your argument sounds more like Glenn Beck.

Those people who managed to receive that wealth had merit to do so, it is not like there is a dollar figure placed on merit.

One day the yogi said to Dorje Legpa, "I am tired of being poor, bring me as much wealth as you can." The next day Dorje Legpa returned, but he only had a small brass coin. "What's this", the yogi, said, "Why did not you not bring me more?"

Feudalism (a wholly inaccurate historical construct) never existed. The English empire was not overcome, it was bequeathed to the United States after two dreadful wars that managed to ruin its economy.

It is always a desiderata when any exploitation is becomes a thing of the past, whether it is exploitation by capitalists, communists, fascists, racists and other kind of "ist" you can imagine. This does not mean that markets can be abolished (they can't), and that people should not be be free to sell their goods or their labor to the person or company that will pay them the most for it. When you "abolish" open (rather than free, since there is also no such a thing as a "free" market) markets, you create the conditions for black markets, where indeed the likely hood of criminal participation is elevated, for example, the Prohibition in the United States. It is also true is that some kinds of goods are deemed criminal, such as heroin, etc., and some kinds of labor are deemed criminal, such as protection rackets.

Therefore, markets require regulation, and that is the principle economic role of a government. That so much wealth is concentrated into the hands of so few at this juncture in history represents a fundamental failure of market regulation brought about by the "liberalization" of the world economy which represents a failure on the part of the various governments in the world to understand the proper role of regulation in the market place, so that open markets can function healthily.

No, because, having been to South Africa myself, I can tell you that people are just as non-virtuous as they were before, and apart from a rising black middle class, the apartheid system still exists more or less as before, with the main difference being that most of the cops are black, as is the government.

Johnny Dangerous said:
and if not, and you consider it positive, how do you categorically differentiate something like that from any attempt to change the economic system, revolutionary or otherwise? is it just the violence, and idea of taking by force that makes something a wrong headed attempt to make people be virtous?

Malcolm wrote:
People are free do what they like and most people are ignorant of karma in any case, they don't believe in it. We don't accept fate in Buddhadharma any more than we do God as an explanation for the state of things. But we do accept karma as an explanation for the state of things, both individually as well as collectively (aggregated individual action). The Buddha makes it exceedingly clear that all who engage in any sort of lethal violence will experience negative results in both this life and in future lives.

All political discussion by so called Buddhists must have the view of karma in mind.

Johnny Dangerous said:
I am detecting a hint here  that a belief in karma negates the possibility of trying to create a world of with more just conditions at all, albeit impermanent ones;)

Malcolm wrote:
Well, you can try, but then more unjust situations will replace the one you have solved. I am not saying "don't try", I am saying that we need to understand the limitations of being sentient beings in samsara.

Not all persons are Buddhists, and not even Buddhists act carefully with respect to karma, as we can see in Burma, Shri Lanka and elsewhere.

We can also be confident that all unjust actions will be met with karmic ripening for the perpetrators of those actions. As long as people engage in the activities motivated by the three or five afflictions there will be injustice and inequality in the world. However, you cannot remove the root of negative karma, malice, covetousness and ignorance, from people minds with a scalpel.

But what you can do is act more justly with people around you. You can act kindly, you can exemplify the virtues of our practice. But you cannot change others to your liking, and more importantly, it is very difficult to change samsara. And in particular I am saying that trying to bring the edifice of the capitalist economy crashing down artificially will merely result in more negative karma for the people who engineer it because if you think there is suffering now, you haven't seen anything.

Johnny Dangerous said:
if you aren't saying this in any way, sorry for misinterpreting you..this is why i'm asking for specifics regarding the difference between forcing people to be virtuous, and creating the conditions for people to be virtuous - from a Buddhist standpoint. I think one can see that today, in terms of our society, we are in a place that does not promote people being virtuous with their wealth..so i'm asking, again from a Buddhist standpoint, should that be entirely left alone - is that your position, or are you saying something else?

Malcolm wrote:
We do not have a Buddhist king who can advise people wisely. And I personally do not want a Socialist dictatorship directing my life. Perhaps it is because I am an American, and we Americans in general are pretty much historically opposed to Communism. Indeed, even when Socialism was popular in the US, it was popular mainly among first generations immigrants at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th, not amongst those who had been born and bred here, and for the most part, second generation immigrants, horrified by the excesses of Stalin, eschewed it.

The anti-facist Socialist idealism of the thirties in in the US pretty much died when we understood that there is structurally no difference between Marxist-Leninist Socialism and Fascism in terms of outcomes, both have planned economies, both use secret police to terrorize dissent, etc.

85 people may own 1/2 the worlds wealth, but so what? They will die, inheritance taxes will be applied, this state of affairs is very impermanent. All we need to worried about is that our own wealth is gotten virtuously, without stealing it from another.

And we need to understand that in general we cannot change the disparities between people since people have their own karma. This is the reason for example that Buddha did not give his golden alms bowl to a poor family living by a river because he saw that due to their latent afflictions they would all take rebirth in lower realms as a result of such a sudden influx of wealth. Of course, I am not Buddhist so I cannot predict anything, so I have no idea what would happen of 1/2 the world's wealth was suddenly "redistributed". But who would adjudicate it to make it fair?

You see, this is all just a bunch of proliferation.

A thing and its nature are not separate.  Saying a thing arises is not different from saying the nature of the thing arises.  It has to be if inseparability is to make any sense.  Therefore when a thing arises, its emptiness arises with it.  When a thing ceases, the emptiness of that thing ceases because there is no emptiness of that thing to point to.  So there is actually no two arisings as you have asserted.  There is only one arising of the phenomenon and its nature and there is only one ceasing of the phenomenon and its nature.

Malcolm wrote:
Indeed, from the perspective of Madhyamaka a thing and its nature are identical. This is not so for those in lower schools.

To elaborate, conditions are merely an appearance. The notion of conditioned and unconditioned arises out of the substantialist roots of the substantialist tenet systems. By showing that the essence of phenomena is unconditioned, you are essentially showing that phenomena are in truth unconditioned. This is why the Prajñāpāramita makes statements like:

Any teaching by the Bhagavan that matter lacks inherent existence, does not arise, does not cease, is peace from the beginning and is parinirvana by nature, all such teaching are not the indirect meaning, nor the intentional meaning, but must be understood literally.

You see, Buddha wanted people to become wealthy. There are many places in the sutras where he gives recommendations for how laypeople may virtuously maximize their wealth. We have already established too that one's social position depends on one's karma, and therefore, one access to initial wealth and opportunity. Of course, we must try our best to extend opportunity to everyone. The construction of schools, hospitals, roads, etc., these things are costs society must bear for everyone's benefit. But it is impossible to provide everyone with the exact same economic parity. Some people are lazier than others. Some people are more talented than others. Some people are more industrious than others because of their karmic dispositions. In reality, social classes tend to driven by the five afflictions: the lower classes tend to be dominated by ignorance and desire, the middle classes tend to be dominated by desire and jealousy and the upper classes tend to be dominated by anger and pride (which is one reason why those from the upper classes tend to more easily fall into lower realms).

It means simply that when you examine dependently originated phenomena you cannot ascertain that they ever arose. A phenomena that never arose is defined as "unconditioned", for example, space, which is the primary metaphor used to describe the actual nature of things. Thus, when we examine phenomena for essences we cannot find one, because phenomena do not arise by virtue of an essence, they in fact, or in truth, never arise. This is what it means to say that conditioned phenomena possess an unconditioned nature, no more and no less.

If conditioned phenomena possessed a conditioned nature, that nature would also have to arise, leading to dual arising for same phenomena, which is absurd. However, since conditioned phenomena possess an unconditioned nature their arising is only apparent, not actual, merely conventional, similar with an illusion, etc. This covers all qualms you may have.

Merely saying that emptiness is defined as unconditioned does not addressed my question, which was how is it possible to have a thing that is both conditioned and unconditioned at the same time.  Perhaps, you are saying it is possible as long as it is defined as possible.

Malcolm wrote:
"For those whom emptiness is possible, everything is possible, for those whom emptiness is not possible, nothing is possible"

If emptiness is a synonym for dependent arising, that would imply that dependent arising is unconditioned.  Or to put is more starkly, it would mean that dependent arising does not arise dependently.
There is no entity "dependent arising", there are only phenomena that arise in dependence. Space, the two cessations and emptiness do not arise at all, so they are by definition phenomena that do not arise in dependence. Of course, this does not mean that they are not relative, for both conditioned and unconditioned phenomena are relative. Since both conditioned and unconditioned phenomena are relative, their relationship is strictly a matter of definition.

As for dependently origination phenomena being unconditioned, the Prajñāpāramita states "Whatever arises in dependence, that in truth does not arise". The argument can be made that even so called dependently originated phenomena are unconditioned in reality, since their production cannot be ascertained at all when subjected to ultimate analysis. Again in this respect there is no contradiction between a conventionally conditioned entity having a conventionally unconditioned nature since in reality both are merely conventions. While the former bears the latter as its nature, in reality neither the former nor the latter can stand up to ultimate analysis. In other words there are no phenomena at all that can stand up to ultimate analysis.

Yes, unconditioned things can be truly existents or false existents that are not dependently arisen.  But unconditioned things cannot include false existents that are dependently arisen, don't you agree?
Of course I do not agree: for example, space, an unconditioned phenomena, permeates all conditioned phenomena, and neither obstructs conditioned phenomena nor is obstructed by them. Emptiness, another unconditioned phenomena, likewise permeates all conditioned phenomena, neither obstructing them nor being obstructed by them.

It is precisely because of such contradictions that Garfield and Priest were forced to conclude from their study of Nagarjuna that ultimately there is no ultimate and that dependent arising is all there is.
Jay Garfield is a lovely guy, and an excellent analytical philosopher (he is a professor in the Philosophy Department at Smith college, along with my father (now retired)), however, he is wrong in so far that there isn't even dependent origination in the ultimate analysis.
Again, I don't think that giving a definition as an answer will resolve the logical contradiction that my question raises.
Your question presumes an entity/entity relationship, therefore your very question is flawed. Emptiness is not an entity, neither are phenomena, other than conventionally.

I did address the claim in other posts, since it comes up a lot. I'll be to the point here:

Nozick is an outlier in libertarianism, the mainstream is probably better defined by Rothbard's Ethics of Liberty (and some Rand), in that he rejects the natural inalienable rights accepted by the American Revolutionaries. This sits better with me, since I think that the main weakness of libertarianism is that people overlook the obvious theological roots of Lockean rights. It's all protestant drivel to me. However, I do not understand why you still place me in the same camp as Nozick, since fundamentally he agrees with mainstream libertarians in believing that the solution is "limited government." After what I have written, I think it is clear that I think this notion is absurd. Government can't be limited by itself, and if it's limited by something higher, then it's not a government in my use of the word.

He merely takes the Lockean state of nature as preferable to the Hobbsian one.

Emptiness by definition is unconditioned. In Mahāyāna, space, the two cessations and emptiness are all defined as unconditioned.

This is a contradiction, something truly existent can have no relative modes at all because a true existent, be unconditioned and uncaused, cannot express itself as a causal process.

Malcolm wrote:
A true existent is unconditioned as you have stated above and cannot express itself as a causal process.  Yet if you say that dharmin and dharmata are inseparable, then you are saying that the nature of an unconditioned thing can be in a thing that is a casual process or the result of a causal process.
The four unconditioned phenomena defined by Mahāyāna are all empty. This is why one of the 18 emptinesses illustrated by Candrakirit is called the emptiness of the unconditioned.

All proposed true existents are unconditioned, but not all unconditioned phenomena are true existents (such as space, the two cessations and emptiness). Therefore, in this respect, since dharmatā refers to the nature of things, which is their emptiness, dharmatā and dharmin are inseparable, yet one is unconditioned and the other, conditioned. I.e. the emptiness of things is not created, and is not subject to decay. It does not arise because things arise, and does not disappear because things disappear. Everything is empty, and that is not something subject to conditions. Therefore, emptiness is not subject to conditions.

Further, if emptiness, which is by definition unconditioned, were to be different than that conditioned thing it is the emptiness of, the thing would not be empty and the emptiness itself would not be an emptiness.


Unknown said:
Further, emptiness is not a true existent for it itself is also empty.

Malcolm wrote:
If emptiness is not a true existent, then it cannot be unconditioned.  Yet you have said earlier that clarity is conditioned and emptiness is unconditioned and are inseparable.

Basically, folks like Tony Page really are faced two alternatives, either their "true self" is like Purusha of the Saṃkhya school, a totally unconditioned individuated knower, as opposed to the nonsentient evolutes of prakriti (buddhi, ahaṃkara, manas, five sense organs, five organs of action, the five subtle elements (sound, etc.) and the five coarse elements; or it is like brahmin of the Vedantins and so on. They really have only these two choices if they insist on a literal interpretation of the term "atman", bdag nyid in texts like the Nirvana Sutra and so on.

In Saṃkhya there are an infinite number of purushas, while in Advaita, using the basic model of Saṃkhya, proposes that purusha and brahmin are synonymous and further, that there is only one purusha, and that further, prakriti and its evolutes are also included in purusha.

While the topic is still fresh, I found this nice quote from the same book about the Trotskyist conception of the state:
To sum up [Trotsky wrote], “the road to Socialism lies through a period of the highest possible intensification of the principle of the State ... The State, before disappearing, assumes the form of the dictatorship of the proletariat, i.e. the most ruthless form of State, which embraces the life of the citizens authoritatively in every direction” ([The Defence of Terrorism] p. 157). It would be difficult indeed to put the matter more plainly. The state of the proletarian dictatorship is depicted by Trotsky as a huge permanent concentration camp in which the government exercises absolute power over every aspect of the citizens’ lives and in particular decides how much work they shall do, of what kind and in what places. Individuals are nothing but labour units. Compulsion is universal, and any organization that is not part of the state must be its enemy, thus the enemy of the proletariat. All this, of course, is in the name of an ideal realm of freedom, the advent of which is expected after an indefinite lapse of historical time. (Vol. II pg. 512)

Socialism in general must descend to this ultimately:
Bukharin, like Lenin, regarded the system of basing economic life on mass terror not as a transient necessity but as a permanent principle of socialist organization. He did not shrink from justifying all means of coercion and held, like Trotsky at the same period, that the new system called essentially for the militarization of labour – i.e. the use of police and military force to compel the whole population to work in such places and conditions as the state might arbitrarily decree. Indeed, once the market is abolished there is no longer any free sale of labour or competition between workers, and police coercion is therefore the only means of allocating “human resources”. If hired labour is eliminated, only compulsory labour remains. In other words, socialism – as conceived by both Trotsky and Bukharin at this time – is a permanent, nation-wide labour camp. (Vol III. pg. 28-9)

For example, if someone accumulates a great deal of money or property, this is a result of their karma. We can encourage them to use it in a socially responsible way, but if we "liberate" it for the "people", believing that a factory for example "belongs" to its workers, then we will be in for some very heavy negative karma of poverty in our future life. On the other hand, if we believe a factory is engaged in unfair practices, and we picket, and protest, appealing to the government to step in, there is no problem with this. Buddhist Vinaya has long established that in terms of matters of law, the civil law of the country you are in handles civil matters and must be obeyed.

So, I am all for people trying to make the world a better place as long as they do so civilly, non-violently and without engaging in force to achieve their ends. I can understand when people react with extreme violence to heavy oppression, understand it, but this also is really just samsaric behavior. At a certain point in your life, you have to give up attachment to samsara and your own selfish liberation and instead cultivate bodhicitta and a view which is free from grasping.

If you read and follow what is taught in Mahāyāna you will have perfect prescription for how to benefit sentient beings in this life and the next with no need to resort the theories of doctrines of materialists.

I think some ideas around Karma might be worth thinking about. What do people think of these idea:
(sorry, more Wiki.... I did say I'm no scholar.
Loy argues that the idea of accumulating merit too easily becomes "spirtitual materialism," a view echoed by other Buddhist modernists,[105] and further that

"Karma has been used to rationalize racism, caste, economic oppression, birth handicaps and everything else. Taken literally, karma justifies the authority of political elites, who therefore must deserve their wealth and power, and the subordination of those who have neither. It provides the perfect theodicy: if there is an infallible cause-and-effect relationship between one's actions and one's fate, there is no need to work toward social justice, because it's already built into the moral fabric of the universe. In fact, if there is no undeserved suffering, there is really no evil that we need to struggle against. It will all balance out in the end."[104]

While some strands of later Buddhist thought did attribute all experience to past karma, the early texts explicitly did not, and in particular state that caste is not determined by karma.[106]
Does anybody know about these early texts that explicitly state that caste is not determined by Karma? Apparently the source for this statement on Wiki came from this reference:
Matthews, Bruce (1986), "Chapter Seven: Post-Classical Developments in the Concepts of Karma and Rebirth in Theravada Buddhism", in Neufeldt, Ronald W., Karma and Rebirth: Post Classical Developments, State University of New York Press,

I will also throw in this article by Thanissaro Bhikkhu:

On class, I think the  Buddha's idea of class or caste is different to the Marxian definition. It isn't really the same as how wealthy you are or based on culture/attitudes etc.

Malcolm wrote:
"“Under the patriarchal system, under the caste system, under the feudal and corporative system, there was division of labor in the whole of society according to fixed rules. Were these rules established by a legislator? No. Originally born of the conditions of material production, they were born of the conditions of material production; they were raised to the status of laws only much later. In this way these different forms of the division of labour became so many bases of social organization.” ‘Poverty of Philosophy’, 118.

Marx's idea is precisely this. The Buddha would say no, people are born into social stations based on their karma. The two views are therefore incompatible.

tellyontellyon said:
When Marxists talk about class they are referring to particular economic roles that only really exist under capitalism.

Malcolm wrote:
In Capital he writes:

“Manufacture, in fact, produces the skill of the detail labourer, by reproducing, and systematically driving to an extreme within the workshop, the naturally developed differentiation of trades which it found ready to had in society at large. On the other hand, the conversion of fractional work into the life-calling of one man, corresponds to the tendency shown by earlier societies, to make trades hereditary; either to petrify them into castes, or whenever definite historical conditions beget in the individual a tendency to vary in a manner incompatible with the nature of castes, to ossify them into guilds. Castes and guilds arise from the action of the same natural law that regulates the differentiation of plants and animals into species and varieties, except that when a certain degree of development has been reached, the heredity of castes and exclusiveness of guilds are ordained as a law of society.” (p. 321. Moscow edition 1974).

I see no real distinction that can be made apart from that fact that, put in Marxist terms, these castes arose as a result of primitive accumulations which were then capitalized.

So Capitalism as defined by Marx is a new phenomenon.

Specifically, modern Capitalism is a post colonial evolution based on the discovery of gold and silver in the Americas and so on.

If you take the broader view, there have been many waves of capitalism since ancient history, like a trees in a forest, beings compete for resources, some are more effective at gathering resources, other's less. Eventually, the whole forest becomes moribund and is either replaced with new species of trees, or it dies altogether.

To Marxists the state IS violence. It is a tool for one class to control another. There is an ever present threat of violence that becomes overt if you step outside the limits that are acceptable to the ruling class. Sometimes the cage is bigger, sometimes smaller, but there is always an armed guard.

Malcolm wrote:
States form out of protection societies, in general. We can see this in the case of the Buddha, who in a past life as the Bodhisattva, was appointed the first human king, or so the legend runs, and was appointed a sixth share of the harvest for his troubles.

But as long as human beings are subject to desire, hatred and ignorance, then for that long there will be classes of people, discrimination and so on. There is a reason Buddhists refer to themselves as "insiders". This means that we seek the solution to social ills and problems through personal transformation. There is no way you can remove the three afflictions merely through altering a given set of material relations. The proof of this is the psychological misery of the wealthy. Wealth does not make anyone happy. Of course this does not mean you cannot use material things to entice people into entering the teachings. The four means of converting beings to the Dharma are generosity (which itself as four aspects: giving material gifts, conferring fearlessness, loving kindness and teaching Dharma), pleasant speech, conduct and setting an example.

However, Marxist psychological theory, in contrast with Buddhist teachings, holds that all psychological states are fundamentally  a result of social conditions fostered by material relationships, i.e. it is entirely materialist in its perspective. We can see that this perspective is deeply flawed because in fact as long as sentient beings like ourselves are driven by the three afflictions, there can be no happiness anywhere. Even if your Marxist utopia were possibility, it would swiftly degenerate because humans are driven by afflictions.

The Buddhist point of view is that states and classes arise inevitably because sentient beings are afflicted and driven by the three humors. In Buddhist legend, anarchy prevailed in the golden age when afflictions were very latent in humans. The golden age degenerated after humans began hoarding grains and their afflictions became activated, and thus protection societies emerged, kings were elected, classes were formed and it degenerated until the present epoch.

So in fact it really seems that a doctrine of Anarchy cannot squared with Buddhist teachings, in otherwords, from a Buddhist perspective a stateless society is completely impossible apart from the upper golden age.

But he also clearly demonstrated that no matter what side of a conflict one were on, engaging in lethal violence of any kind would condemn one to hell.

If there is a true self, what experiences this true self?    Does this true self experience itself?   If so, by what means? If the true self exists outside of phenomena and thus any points of reference, what  ultimately does the true self  experience?  If the true self does not actually experience anything, then is it a rock?  What self experiences samsaric existence?    If the samsaric self can be shown to have no true existence, then is it the true self that experiences samsara?   Does a being with no mental capacity have a true self? If that being with no mental capacity is essentially made of phenomena (physical matter) such as carbon, and yet has a true self, then does all carbon have a true self?
The 'true self' theory raises all sorts of conundrums.
It is essentially no different that believing in god, except that in this case, instead of saying "god" one says "true self".

The term bdag nyid, atman, just means, in this case, "nature", i.e. referring to the nature of reality free from extremes as being permanent, blissful, pure and self. The luminosity of the mind is understood to be this.

There are various ways to interpret the Uttaratantra and tathāgatagarbha doctrine, one way is definitive in meaning, the other is provisional, according to Gorampa Sonam Senge, thus the tathāgatagarbha sutras become definitive or provisional depending on how they are understood. He states:

In the context of showing the faults of a literal [interpretation] – it's equivalence with the Non-Buddhist Self is that the assertion of unique eternal all pervading cognizing awareness of the Saṃkhya, the unique eternal pristine clarity of the Pashupattis, the unique all pervading intellect of the Vaiśnavas, the impermanent condition, the measure of one’s body, in the permanent self-nature of the Jains, and the white, brilliant, shining pellet the size of an atom, existing in each individual’s heart of the Vedantins are the same.

The definitive interpretation he renders as follows:

Therefor, the Sugatagarbha is defined as the union of clarity and emptiness but not simply emptiness without clarity, because that [kind of emptiness] is not suitable to be a basis for bondage and liberation. Also it is not simple clarity without emptiness, that is the conditioned part, because the Sugatagarbha is taught as unconditioned.

Khyentse Wangpo, often cited as a gzhan stong pa, basically says that the treatises of Maitreya elucidate the luminosity of the mind, i.e. its purity, whereas Nāgarjuna's treatises illustrate the empty nature of the mind, and that these two together, luminosity and emptiness free from extremes are to be understood as noncontradictory, which we can understand from the famous Prajñāpāramita citation "There is no mind in the mind, the nature of the mind is luminosity".

Hiya Malcolm,
This is a key question. Marx and Engels addressed this and Lenin really focussed on this in the first chapter of his book: The State and Revolution.

He goes into what the 'State' is from a Marxist perspective, what maintains it, and why, undercapitalism, it will not 'whither away'; he explains the need for revolution and how the state would 'wither away' only after that. I guess it will not be your 'cup of tea', but if you can grit your teeth and get through the whole of the first chapter then you will have your answer.

It will put how Norwegians feel about these things and shows the deep ambiguity Norwegians feel about "doing the right thing" in contrast to their very real and deep cultural conservatism. Until very recently, Norway was a very homogenous country, and these things we are seeing are problems Norwegians have only recently had to deal with. Of course the former British empire, we have more experience with diversity so some of the growing pains we went through over a hundred years ago seems obvious as well as their solutions.

But there were only 6 assault rapes out of something like 152 rapes.

Malcolm wrote:
It doesn't matter. What is defined as rape in Norway is a little different:

In Norway, rape is defined under the Norwegian Penal Code[40] § 192 as either:
1. engaging in sexual activity by means of violence or threatening behaviour,
2. engaging in sexual activity with somebody who is unconscious or for any other reason incapable of resisting the act, or
3. by means of violence or threatening behaviour compelling any person to engage in sexual activity with another person, or to carry out similar actions with him- or herself.

Further, the same section defines aggravated rape as a rape committed
a. by multiple persons in cooperation (gang rape)
b. in a particularly painful or offensive manner
c. by a person previously convicted of rape under § 192 or of sexual activity with a child under the age of 14 (as per § 195 of the penal code)
d. in such a way that the victim either dies or receives grievous bodily harm.
The section recognizes sexually transmitted diseases (defined in the Infection Protection Act) as grievous bodily harm.

So, if person A has herpes and does not inform person B of this fact, and person B contracts herpes, person A can be accused of rape in Norway.

Or if person A manages to cause pain, or is offensive to person B, this can also be defined as rape.

Basically, the bar for "rape" in Norway is much lower than it is in other countries. In the US, giving someone herpes is offensive, but the onus is on person B to protect his/her own health.

tellyontellyon said:
What about what he said about the Roma? Did you read it?
They are criticized a lot by people, because they have zero interest in behaving in accordance with Norwegian norms and laws. They don't want to work (although that's their excuse used in order to be here and beg for money). They steal, and they treat wherever it is they're staying as if it is an open toilet, defecating and urinating everywhere, be it in a kindergarten property, people's backyards, the forests, open parks, or what not (and when at one point they were given toilets to use, they shat down the toilets as well). People get fed up with the police not doing anything about them shitting everywhere, or stealing.

Yes, of course I read it. The question is, did Norwegian personally witness such behavior or is he merely repeating hearsay. What we can understand from this, however is that Norway's push for integration is a laughable failure in many respects, and has provoked a backlash of resentment.

In the US, for example, apart from statutory rape, i.e. sleeping with a minor, there are no other kinds. I am quite sure that is what Norwegian is talking about, not the all the other kinds of rape defined under Norwegian law that would not even be recognized as rape, in for example, England.

What Norwegian is talking about is the fact that the immigration and integration policies are such failures in Norway that these Norwegian policies are hugely lampooned by Norwegians in such shows as Lilyhammer.

The main problem in the US is that the economy has become non-functional primary due to cultural reasons and the refusal of a dead-locked government to take further action, even to acknowledge the problems.  The reason that "leaders" go not acknowledge these issues is because they are counter to the received ideology and solutions tend to lay outside the scope of market forces and Keynes has been sidelined.   If you have market fundamentalists at nearly every level of every institution, there isn't much to be done when market fundamentalists face a reality that shouldn't exist.  You also have the hype-pragmatic stance of Americans: most trends show a slow, slow recovery (U-3 unemployment ~ 6%) by the end of 2014 so the boat seems to be righting itself without further action.  The problem is that the replacement jobs are low wage and not secure.

Is your thinking on this influenced by Spengler by any chance?

I thought his https://archive.org/details/PrussianismAndSocialism of Anglo-American capitalism vs Prussian/German-style socialism was pretty spot-on. He also identifies Marxism as a failed attempt to formulate a Prussian-style system based on Anglo-Saxon assumptions. This prediction, written in 1920, seems quite accurate:
"Instead of authoritarian socialism, the English or American billionaire adheres to an impressive form of private socialism, a welfare program on a grand scale which turns his own personal power into pleasure and morally vanquishes the recipient of welfare funds.The flashy techniques for distributing these millions are an effective cover-up for the methods used to obtain them in the first place. It is the same attitude as that of the old corsairs who, while banqueting in the castle just conquered, threw their table scraps to the prisoners: the voluntary surrender of property increases the value of what remains. The question whether or not such voluntary acts should become a legal duty is the chief point of contention among the economic parties of the future in England and America."

Of course you are making personal comments. It is becoming rather disgusting.

You have to understand one important point about "American" ideals. They are really the ideals of two groups: New Englanders and small group of educated Virginians. There was a compromise reached with the Deep South, which was not one that was easily made.

However, I can state with confidence that states like Massachusetts, and NE in general along with New York, as well as the left coast states really do live up to "American" ideals. But America is not just one country, it is in fact a nation historically comprised of 11 distinct cultural groups. Unfortunately, people in the culture sphere of the Deep South, Appalachia and the "Western States" have rather different ideas about things. The people in the Mid-West tend to be more conservative than New Englanders, but more liberal than the latter groups.

For example, Massachusetts abolished slavery in 1781.

It has stagnated scientifically and technologically although this is not apparent (nor is the stagnation universal - this is not a controversial statement within some tech corporations but a counter statement is that the US has the strategic people and projects it needs and can continue to acquire [buy] what it does not currently have and that some scientific and tech stagnation is not broadly relevant).

Okay so you fall short of the throttling of the market in European social democracies.  Please examine Goedel's Incompleteness Theorem: any sufficiently complex system has true statements which can nonetheless not be proven true within that system.  Sufficiently complex means as complex as arithmetic.  Certainly placing checks and balances on a capitalist economic system is far more complex than arithmetic as both can be modeled as rule based systems and the rules in capitalism far exceed the rules in arithmetic.  Therefore unanticipated capitalist events will continue to occur.  We don't know for sure what they are, but historically they are periods of increase followed by busts.  This is a regular albeit unpredictable cycle.  Another aspect is that economic markets are chaotic (in terms of chaos theory).  Mathematics indicates that capitalism in the long is unreliable.

Is this problem mitigated by the social democracies tight control of it? No, but they can keep it from becoming a cancer and destroying society.

That's a problem but by far not the main problem.  The complete denial of people's access to labor is one of the main problems within the system.  A means of mitigating that is in fact supporting small business and permitting (helping) people who have been locked out of the labor market to start small businesses.

I do not agree with Hayek, actually. You totally miss my point. My point is that capitalists must read Marx, and Marxists must read libertarians, etc.

You should read Nozick, Rawls (main philosopher articulating social justice, and a large government to bring that about), Bookchin, Naess, etc.

No one person's ideas are complete. It is folly to pick one person's book and say "This is my bible". One must read opposing views.

As I told you, my political beliefs are Deep Ecology/Left Biocentric and as a Buddhist I am committed to nonviolence, I cannot support any ideology which even permits the idea of violent revolutionary struggle. Naess has six principles for public debate which I generally adhere to naturally, but also fail at from time to time. They are:

Avoid tendentious irrelevance
Examples: Personal attacks, claims of opponents' motivation, explaining reasons for an argument.
Avoid tendentious quoting
Quotes should not be edited regarding the subject of the debate.
Avoid tendentious ambiguity
Ambiguity can be exploited to support criticism.
Avoid tendentious use of straw men
Assigning views to the opponent that he or she does not hold.
Avoid tendentious statements of fact
Information put forward should never be untrue or incomplete, and one should not withhold relevant information.
Avoid tendentious tone of presentation
Examples: irony, sarcasm, pejoratives, exaggeration, subtle (or open) threats.

These would be very good to adopt as personal commitments for online Buddhist discussions.

I don't know what planet you live on Malcolm but your claim that capitalism as practiced has moral constraints is ludicrous. Oligopoly, monopoly, monopsony and plutocracy are inevitable. Capitalism is a revolutionary force that naturally frees itself from constraints. It will devour the entire ecosystem and then devour itself.

Malcolm wrote:
No, I am making a similar claim to the Marxists, i.e., that the capitalism founded by Smith had a moral theory. Likewise, Marxist style Socialism has a moral theory.

In both cases the the beast unleashed has shaken off the collar of its moral theory every time. We all accept that the Soviet Union and Communist China represent the failure of Marx's theories of economics. No one can possibly claim that any capitalist government has murdered as many people as the communists did in the 20th century. Not even the Nazis murdered as many people as Stalin did alone.

What we have is capitalism, we do not, at present, have another economic system.

What I argue is that trying to change this economic system through revolution will be more harmful than the harm it is presently causing.

Malcolm wrote:
The problems with all of these criticisms of capitalism is that they assume that all value comes solely from labor. This is fine for Smith, Ricardo and Marx, but in fact economists have found the LTV inadequate for explaining all kinds of things in economics.

I guess one of the things I find annoying about the Marxist rank and file is their amateur economics, they all act as if they really understand economics, but what they really do is just recite chapter and verse. And what I also find is that they rarely read contrary points of view. For example, have you read Nozick's Anarchy, State and Utopia? Or Hayek? Even you will never agree with what these fellows say, they are just as smart, if not smarter than Marx and co. Time to expand your horizons.

Malcolm wrote:
When we say checks and balances we mean exactly that, the use of the government to check corporations so the market can function in a balanced way. Until we manage to arrive at an internationally agreed upon system of population reduction and a steady state economy, the Keynesian approach seems to be most sensible, at least here in the USA.

The main problem as I see it, in the USA, is that corporations have too much access to power, and regulations are unfairly applied to small businesses making it impossible for them to compete against large corporations in almost every area.

The main flaw that I see in the US is the unwillingness of Republicans and Democrats alike to see that their policies together are moving the US to a corporatist state ala Gentile.

Malcolm wrote:
It is evident from the words that you write, your complaints on unfairness. Jealousy is still jealousy, even if on behalf of another. You really need to study Bodhicaryāvatara. Instead of rejoicing in people's wealth, and thereby sharing in their merit, you actually create negative karma for yourself by wanting to deprive them of that wealth.

Perhaps you should go to a Buddhist college and properly study Buddhism rather than rotting your mind with Marxist crack.

tellyontellyon said:
No Malcolm, I think we have to help people in a conventional way, that is a part of building merit. It is not enough to visualise yourself and all other beings as compassionate Buddhas... but then not actually do anything compassionate. We can do something about our Karma right now. Karma needs action as well as intention if it is to ripen.

Malcolm wrote:
The Buddha did not accumulate danapāramita by giving everyone all that they wanted, it was sufficient for him to sincerely wish that they had all their wants and needs fulfilled.

In fact, Buddha had a golden begging bowl, given to him by the gods. But he thought it ostentatious and so he threw it away in a river. Before throwing it away however, he noticed an impoverished family nearby. He thought to give it to them, but then, through his clairvoyance, he saw that this sudden wealth would merely cause this poor family all to be reborn in hell. So he threw it away. For centuries Hindus have criticized the Buddha for this act.

Further, making offerings to the Buddha (a pure object) is far more metitorious than relieving all the poverty of the world. The sentient beings of the six realms are the impure merit field. We make offerings to them out of compassion.

And, it is actually quite enough to imagine oneself and all sentient beings as buddhas. That is the Vajrayāna way of rapid Buddhahood. So yes, you even have to visualize all those capitalists, all those 300 or whatever number of wealthy people, as Buddhas. And in their guise as sentient beings, you should want them to have all the wealth that they have and rejoice in it. If they use it improperly, then that is a pity, but they had the merit to gain that wealth in this life and no one should take it away from them. If they are dodging their taxes, well, that is a different issue.

The socio-economic system is not something that just 'happens' to us, we are the ones doing it. Our socio-economic system is a form of activity, of action, of behaviour.

There will always be loss and gain. This natural. Increase here, a decrease there. This is just how conditioned things are.

The Marxists say they want an equal society, equal for who, and who decides what is equal? A committee? A bunch of bureaucrats? Who votes them in? Unions, the "proletariat"? Like all Marxists, you speak out of both sides of your mouth at once. Someone has to run things -- I prefer the randomness of American Democracy any day, even if it is propped up by capitalism, to the rule of a committee.

Your rhetoric is just like that of free marketeers who want unrestricted free trade, well, free for who? You are just one side of the same coin. Neither Marxism or Capitalism for are adequate solution. But of the two, I will favor capitalism, because it is the present system and it should not be brought down by a violent revolution. It cannot be brought down by a peaceful one. You must understand that this is reality. Bringing down capitalism will cause untold suffering for billions, worse suffering than there is even now.

In order for things to change, people must personally evolve, and that is the only solution to our present situation. And you cannot force people to evolve.

So, unfortunately my friend, while you are standing behind barricades fighting with the police, I will be doing what I do anyway, practicing, translating, teaching and seeing patients, fixing the bodies you break in your so called "revolution".

Socialism and Marxism are not the same thing. There are many socialisms. Why a Buddhist picks the most evil materialist form of it is totally beyond understanding.

Mental objects are one class of objects, material objects are another class of objects. You are conflating the two. A mental object (part of the dharmadhātu) is an object for the mano dhātu. A material object is an object for the other five dhātus, form for eye, etc.

I appreciate your presentation of the 18 elements, please explain how an object exists independently of mind without implying an essence. Before a mind is generated, if an object exists, it must exist independent of mind. Vasubahandu's presentation is finally a realist one. I am assuming you want to do better than that.
Vasubandhu's presentation is the one that Madhyamakas subscribe to conventionally. The point is that even Candrakirti accepts that for an eye consciousness to be generated, the eye consciousness depends on an external form. According to your presentation, forms depend solely on consciousness and could never be asserted to exist externally, and as you stated, would not need eyes to be perceived. This would then render all sense organs nonfunctional and unnecessary. But there are so many negative consequences to this I could not possibly list them all.
It is not the intention of Madhyamaka to undermine this or that conventional presentation of the skandhas, dhātus and āyatanas, but merely to show that they are not paramārtha dharmas.

I am interested to see if you can give an explanation of how a thunderstorm could exist that did not arise from karma, without employing a realist ontology.

You need to explain the karmic cause of such a storm.

Simply put however, thunderstorms arises from atmospheric causes and conditions. There is no necessary precondition for a mind to generate those causes and conditions, and you equally cannot demonstrate how karma causes a thunderstorm.

British soldiers murdered entire Scottish villages for resisting the fencing of the Highlands.

It has happened everywhere in the world. No one living anywhere in the world today, save a few peoples in the Amazon [and even then it is questionable] are the first people there who did not push someone else off their land.

I doubt very much you folks over in England of Norman blood are going to be paying reparations to the Saxons anytime soon, nor the Saxons to the Celts and so on. Or me for that matter, since you bloody Brits stole my land.

In reality, we need to remember the words of the Buddha:
"He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,"--in those who harbour such thoughts hatred will never cease. 

"He abused me, he beat me, he defeated me, he robbed me,"--in those who do not harbour such thoughts hatred will cease.

poor and rich people
Perhaps being born rich or poor is a matter or Karma? But that doesn't mean that they can't do something about it.

It is not the same as say being born with one leg... that is a fate you have to accept.

Malcolm wrote:
I nowhere said that one needed to accept the class into which one was born. You can work hard, get an education and improve your circumstances honestly.

What I said was that classes in society were a result of karma, not capitalism.

Also when your socialist brigades begin stealing people's houses "for the people", and closing their bank accounts "for the people", etc., this is just stealing, and it is a non virtuous act. Nationalizing the banks is theft. Theft results in poverty, not prosperity.

When you compare the Buddha's teachings with that of Marx, you will discover than nearly everything a revolution seeks to accomplish by Marxist methods are considered non-virtuous methods in Buddhadharma.

Incidentally, this does not mean that Buddhism regards modern capitalism as wise or virtuous, for it doesn't. It is just the other side of Marxist materialism. That was my point originally, you guys don't reject the capitalist means of production, you just want to own it. But it is that very means of production itself which is pernicious.

Frankly, my friend, I get the impression your education in Buddhadharma is rather limited.

Buddhism and Marxism are incompatible not least because their view of the creation of social classes is radically different. For Buddhists, social class is a result of karma. For Marxists, it is result of material relations. The two views cannot be reconciled.

Class divisions existed long before capitalism, and will exist long after. The classes of the six realms were not created by capitalism. The various classes of animals were not created by capitalism. The classes of devas were not created by capitalism. etc.

Antagonism results when people whose karma landed them in inferior positions become jealous and wish to take from others who are more fortunate [for example, just as the asuras became jealous of the devas]. Likewise, when those who are more fortunate act selfishly and do not properly care for the less fortunate, this too causes class antagonism [for example, when the devas refused to share ambrosia with the asuras].

I'll be honest: the internet gave me a massive wake up call about the state of Buddhism in non-traditional places.

The e-sangha days were remarkable in the history of Buddhism - when ever before have practitioners from every kind of existing tradition been able to communicate so effortlessly with each other?

And yet, it must be concluded that the balance between pluralism, openness, mutual learning and spiritual conceit, dogmatism, sectarian superiority, was decided in favour of the latter.

Malcolm wrote:
That is total bullshit, tobes. You really have no idea why E-Sangha evolved as it did. Most of the so called perception of sectarianism arose out of the need to ascertain who was a qualified ordained person. It was over this point that the rain of charges that we were sectarian fell.

The Theravadins split largely because they had already siloed themselves off on E-Sangha itself, and resented any perception of incursion on their turf by the moderating staff in general.

The confrontation between the ZFI folks and the board was over the question of "what is a monk".

In the end, everyone blames the moderating staff. But in the end, the failure of E-Sangha was a failure of its users, not our policies.

Economic globalization is somewhat misleading. A better term might be globalization of the four freedoms, referring to the so-called four freedoms of the Treaty of Rome, which was the basis for the European Common Market and is still at the core of the present-day European Union (EU). The document’s style of globalization implies successive expansion of its “four freedoms” until it also covers trade among the three giants, the European Union, the United States (and Canada), and Japan, and reluctantly over the rest of the globe. The term four freedoms refers to the free (duty-free) crossing of goods and materials through borders, the free flow of services, the freedom to compete for jobs anywhere (people), and the freedom of capital to flow across any borders. The four freedoms imply four prohibitions, the violation of which will be punished by the authorities. Namely, the freedoms involve strong, adequate protection—for social, medical, ecological, or other reasons of cultural relevance—against the import of certain goods or services, or against certain kinds of flow of foreign capital into a local, regional, or any other limited area, for example, the Arctic coast of Norway.

This is an illusion because we are part of nature and earth, not apart from it. Redefining the economy by embedding it in society and nature is the first step in a paradigm shift. Shifting from GDP and GNP to measures of real wealth, welfare, well-being and happiness is another. Wealth is derived from “weal” (well-being), its original meaning is “condition of well-being”.

tellyontellyon said:
Commodification and privatisation are based and promoted on the flawed belief that price equals value. However, all those working for justice in land and water rights and preventing the ecological abuse of land and water, are asking for the opposite – the inalienable right to resources, and in the case of common property resources like water, the inalienability of common rights. The second paradigm of the green economy is earth-centred and people-centred. The resources of the earth vital to life – biodiversity, water, air – are a commons for the common good for all, and a green economy is based on a recovery of the commons and the intrinsic value of the earth and all her species. It would put nature’s ecological cycles as the drivers and shapers of the economy, it would put people first, not investors, and build on women’s core contributions to create economies of sustenance and care that enhance the well-being of all. The industrial/ corporate system of food production uses ten times more units of energy as inputs than it produces as food. It wastes 50 per cent of the food produced; it uses and pollutes 70 per cent of the water on the planet; it has destroyed 75 per cent of the biodiversity in agriculture; and it contributes 40 per cent of the greenhouse gases that are destabilising the climate and further threatening food security. By contrast, earth-centred agriculture produces twice as much food as the inputs it uses; it conserves biodiversity; it mitigates and adapts to climate change; it protects the earth; farmers and public health.

Richness and diversity of life forms contribute to the realization of these values and are also values in themselves.

Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital needs.

The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantially smaller human population. The flourishing of non-human life requires a smaller human population.

Present human interference with the non-human world is excessive, and the situation is rapidly worsening.

Policies must therefore be changed. These policies affect basic economic, technological, and ideological structures. The resulting state of affairs will be deeply different from the present.

The ideological change will be mainly that of appreciating life quality (dwelling in situations of inherent value) rather than adhering to an increasingly higher standard of living. There will be a profound awareness of the difference between bigness and greatness.

Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation directly or indirectly to try to implement the necessary changes.

Indeed, but it is not Buddhist violence, it is nationalist violence. There are no Buddhist scriptures at all that advocate nationalist violence on any level. There are also no Buddhist scriptures which advocate revolution either.

I'm not in any way suggesting that that is the fault of Buddhism, I simply make the point that Karma is produced by action rather than ideology as such. I also wanted to make the point that mischievous people can take even a peaceful ideology and use it to their own ends.

As far as Deep Ecology is concerned. Democracy is fatally skewed by the power of the super-rich and big corporations, hedge-funds etc. "He who calls the piper calls the tune". If we want control over our environment then we need collective ownership. You can't control what you don't possess. The track record so far shows big business is guided by the profit motive, not by the needs of the many or by environmental considerations.

Malcolm wrote:
Ownership is an anthropocentric concept. It is not a biocentric concept. So your statement right there is flawed from a DE perspective.

You will not achieve collective ownership ever. In order to bring that about you will have to fight a long, bloody war with billions dead. The notions of property rights are too deeply embedded in our legal systems.

In order to change those you will have to overthrow entire governments and social orders.

Basically, I prefer the present world order with all its warts and inconstancies to a world order that would be run by totalitarians such as yourself. You will kill billions in your idealogical zeal to create a "classless" society [but of course there are always classes and always elites]. It would be better for you just to pray for rebirth in a pure land, there are no classes there.

Western Democracies at this point are too stable for your kind of revolutionary politics to ever be successful (Thank Buddha). The only reason why the Russian Revolution had a prayer of success is that the war footing of the western powers created serious economic instability worldwide. The same was true of China forty years later.

The only solution to the world's problems is the abandonment of violence at all costs, and slowly educating people one person at a time. Inner evolution is the only key to the world's problems, not outer revolution.

Like this from the Upaya-kaushalya Sutra, a Mahayana text that’s name literally means ‘skillful means.’
While on board a ship, Shakyamuni [Buddha] discovers that there is a robber intent on killing all five hundred of his fellow passengers. Shakyamuni ultimately decides to kill the robber, not only for the sake of his fellow passengers but also to save the robber himself from the karmic consequences of his horrendous act. In doing so, the negative karma from killing the robber should have accrued to Shakyamuni but it did not...

Malcolm wrote:
You do understand that the bodhisattva in this story possessed clairvoyance and was able to read the thief's mind? Correct? Do you possess such clairvoyance?

Without taking this fact into account, the story becomes skewed. The story in the  Ārya-upāyakauśalya-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra is not intended to demonstrate that Buddhists should engage in violent interventions. It is intended to demonstrate the amazing capacities of a bodhisattva on the stages. There is another story in the Jatakas where the bodhisattva, when he was reborn as Viśvaṃtara, gave his wife and children away to a brahmin in order to practice the perfection of giving.

tellyontellyon said:
You posted some of the most inflammatory things that marx wrote. But Marx's ideas developed over his lifetime and must be taken in the context of the historical situation and in the context of what violence others were doing at the time. Marx also said that he thought in advanced counties, with well developed democracy that a genuinely socialist society could come about without revolution.
The fact is when we are talking about Marx we have to ask: which Marx?

You also have to use marxist language with care, for example 'Dictatorship of the Proleteriat' simply means workers democracy. They used words differently in the 1840's.

Malcolm wrote:
Marx was:

a materialist (Charvaka)
argued that violence was acceptable, and even necessary
was a proponent of forced wealth redistribution (theft), which is and always has been bad economic policy. Taxation is always a better solution.

You have to understand I have read Marx. Marx can be amusing, for example his critique of colonialism at the end of Capital.

tellyontellyon said:
For example, revolution sounds pretty nasty but:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolutionary_socialism
The term revolutionary socialism refers to socialist tendencies that subscribe to the doctrine that social revolution is necessary in order to effect structural changes to society. More specifically, it is the view that revolution is a necessary precondition for a transition from capitalism to socialism. Revolution is not necessarily defined as a violent insurrection; it is defined as seizure of political power by mass movements of the working class so that the state is directly controlled by the working class as opposed to the capitalist class and its interests.[1] Revolutionary socialists believe such a state of affairs is a precondition for establishing socialism.

Malcolm wrote:
I don't want the state to be controlled by the working class, per se.

I have no confidence whatsoever that a workers state will have a Deep Ecological outlook. Marxism and Deep Ecology are at odds because the former is anthropocentric and the latter is biocentric.

In the end, I think that, as far as it goes, American Democracy and its analogues in other countries is the best system of government we humans have yet come up, and I do not see Marxist socialism as any improvement at all.

I am a Buddhist. Just as the Buddha did not believe in caste, I do not believe that one "class" has an inherent moral superiority to another class: this is materialist thinking.

Buddhist thinking maintains that people are born into poverty or wealth because of their karma. There are social classes because people's actions in past lives define where they are born in this one, just as their past actions define whether sentient are born as animals or devas.

tellyontellyon said:
In any case, wouldn't it be far far better to talk about what actually needs to be done rather than focus on abstract ideology and throwing quotes back and forth?

Malcolm wrote:
Marxists have very Marxian ideas about what needs to be done, and as part of the Judeo-Christian tradition, they tend to the have the view that the planet is here to serve humans, its resources rightly belonging to humans. This is not only contra Buddhist principles, it is contra deep ecological principles.

tellyontellyon said:
It is our actions that really matter.

Malcolm wrote:
It is meritorious to want to help people, of course, but one must not lose sight of what actually creates diversity in this world: it is not economics, it is karma. You can be sure that those super wealthy people who do nothing to benefit others are exhausting their karma. There is nothing to be angry about. They are to be pitied because in their next life, they will be worse than paupers. Nāgārjuna says:
If one becomes a king through long veneration, 
one does not pursue wealth, family, and friends;
also no matter where people go or live, 
action follows just like a shadow.
If you accumulate positive actions in this life, in the next life you not need to struggle for your wants and needs. If you find you are in place of leisure and wealth in this life, use it for Dharma practice and to help those you can.

tellyontellyon said:
As for saying that Buddhists whould be better off not getting involved in politics... well, thats not really possible. Unless you live alone in a cave (and I'm not knocking that btw), then you have a responsibility to contribute to the communal activities of living in a community. That includes working out how you are going to live together, treat each other etc. etc. Restricting contact to members of the Sangha or only to non-materialists is not always possible if you are not a monk. It certainly isn't possible where I live in Wales.

Malcolm wrote:
The commitments of refuge to the Sangha does not mean that one does not mean that one does not do business and cultivate friendships with non-buddhists, etc., it means that one avoids those who would seek to harm Buddhism or who are engaged in very non-virtuous lifestyles.

tellyontellyon said:
Even if you are a monk, then I still think that monks need to have a think about the food and donations they recieve in their alms bowl: I think it is not enough simply to have gratitude... What did the worker have to go through to be able to make that donation?

Making donations to the Three Jewels is the best way to ensure one's rebirth will be higher in the next life, with more opportunity. Encouraging others to do so is also meritorious. It is also meritorious to help others as much as one can. It is not meritorious to foment social revolutions when the result is so often death, destruction and war.

tellyontellyon said:
Anyway, whether you agree with me or not. Please, Please stop having sideways stabs at the Muslims, it undermines your own argument and makes you look intolerant.

Malcolm wrote:
I have nothing personal against Muslims. It is their karma to be born Muslims, with animal sacrifice as a major and important part of their religion. In my opinion, part of the reason that Islamic countries have such a high level of violence is that their religion condones animal sacrifice. There is an observable level of poverty and violence that afflicts every nation in which there is a major religion that sanctions animal sacrifice. This is one of the reasons why Southern Hemisphere countries have such problems. You might object, what about the 60 billion animals a year that are slaughtered for meat to feed the North? The karmic cause is different, therefore the effect is different.

I have a lot of issues with both Islam and Christianity in general. They both are authors of great destruction and havoc in the world. I don't trust Islamic states, or indeed any religious state (including "Buddhist" ones) on any level in general. Thanks goodness one of the effects of the American Constitution was the elimination of state religions in Western Democracies for the most part.

In fact, Marxism and Islam have many structural similarities, similarities noted by George Bataille in his work, The Accursed Share. You should read it.

I trust the translation, but to interpolate that this means the "consent of the people" in the modern sense of that phrase, I would not. This was the extent of your claim, and I don't accept it.

As regards the idea that the monarch is supposed to be "enlightened," no I don't believe in this either, not in the sense of buddha. However, speaking in terms of practical management of a kingdom, the rule of one who is unenlightened but selected for perceived management capacity, is wiser than the rule of all indiscriminately, who all at the same time are unenlightened. There really is such a thing as too many chefs in the kitchen, i.e. more than one. So, be careful with how far you think my claims are extending -- they may not encompass the breadth you imagine them to. However, I do appreciate your comments, they are by far the most constructive so far.

as you will recall, Mahā-sammata (an earlier incarnation of the Buddha, and also the Buddhist Manu) was appointed king by farmers who wanted to protect grain they had begun to store.

Also you can find this explained in this alternate translation:

‘He is appointed [agreed to] by the people (mahā,janena sammato),’114 Vāseṭṭha and Bhāradvāja; therefore, he is called “the great elect” (mahā sammata.

However, to address the small matter of an accusation of misrepresentation on my part with regards to the title of one of Trotsky's books, the 1921 Labour Publishing Co. and Allen & Unwin, London edition is indeed named The Defence of Terrorism.

The process is a removal of afflictions, and the visions are a sign of that, so they don't appear simply because of the natural state, and thus their disappearance is the final accomplishment. I didn't think dissolution here means total nothing, otherwise it wouldn't be the achievement of buddhahood for the benefit of all beings. Just as in mahamudra non-meditation is not about absolute non-activity. However, it seems to me that thogal and its visions is only one possible method of purification, and not the culmination of everything else, therefore other paths don't need it.

Malcolm wrote:
It is not really a process of removing afflictions, it is more of a process of afflictions becoming undone on their own.

Some people assert that the increase of the visions occurs separately from the karmic winds, using this as an example of why for example thogal is superior to other completion stage practices, but too is also not precisely correct. The movement of karmic vāyus in the body is a result of affliction, and it is precisely these that hinder the development of the thogal visions. The postures are meant to still these vāyus which is why you have to remain in them for long periods.

The visions in dzogchen are not conceptual constructs like visualizations of the creation and completion stage.

The vanishing of the visions is likened to bands of light returning into a prism, i.e, the colors are inherent in the crystal, but there are no more conditions which cause the potentiality (rtsal) of the crystal to manifest externally.

Thus the buddhaforms and so on that one sees always exist in oneself as the potentiality of the threefold wisdom of the basis, original purity, natural perfection, and compassion. Of these three what actually appears to be an external vision is the compassion aspect.

The Sakyapa explanation of the cause of the appearance of the visions of the first stage of the six branch yoga resembles the explanation of the genesis of the thogal vision of dharmatā. The similarities seem to end there.

In some respects, I am sympathetic to Astus's statement that man ngag sde is a return to "tantrism", but he has it slightly wrong. man ngag sde represents a desire to ground Dzogchen in its own completely independent system of empowerments, and one can see that it takes a page out of the Kalacakra system of the common four empowerments and then a system of the "higher four empowerments". Please do recall that famed Three Words of Garab Dorje did not even exist until the 1120's when the Vima Nyingthig was revealed by Zhangton Tashi Dorje.

However, the idea that at the end of the four visions there are no appearances is a complete misconception. I will merely quote the beginning of Shabkar's discussion of the fourth vision on this point:
It so happens that in the past some Dzogchenpas

The distinction was first introduced in the early 70's by Trungpa, incidentally.

Just like deep ecologists, I'm afraid. (And I'm saying that as a huge fan of DE).

Malcolm wrote:
Oh definitely, DE is an intellectual movement in many respects. There is nothing to be gained by Deep Ecologists joining party politics. In the US Green Party, the DE voice has been completely suppressed by the Bookchin faction.

As David Orton points out:

Green parties have become shallow ecology defenders of industrial capitalist society, even if Arne Naess was supportive of them. The German Green Party theoretician Rudolf Bahro resigned from the party in the early 1980s, and pointed out that green party shallow ecology  is content to “brush the teeth” of industrial society.

And:

There is arrogance among socialists who think that they should be leading the ecological movement, because they have a “class analysis” and are anti-capitalist. What comes across is that the Left believes it is entitled to intellectual hegemony in the green and environmental movements, by virtue of prior knowledge. The Left does not seem to be able to absorb the pluralism of green and environmental politics – as Naess informed us, “the front is long” – let alone accept the earned leadership of others by virtue of their practical or theoretical work. Ed Abbey noted, through the character Doc Sarvis in The Monkey Wrench Gang, the importance of practical involvement in actual environmental struggles: “Let our practice form our doctrine, thus assuring precise theoretical coherence.” (p. 68) The idea that deeper environmentalists and greens can come to an anti-capitalist critique based on their own experiences, without studying Marxism or social ecology, but based on field experience, seems, apparently, difficult to grasp for the Left.
https://deepgreenweb.blogspot.com/2011/01/deep-ecology-and-left-contradictions.html

If you are curious as to what my "practical involvement in actual environmental struggles" are, it is precisely my study of traditional medicine, in part in inspired by the anarchist writer Laurel Luddites piece, Anarcho-herbalism:

Medicine is just one part of the machine that we have to take back and re-create into a form that works for the society we will become. Every herb, pill, and procedure should be judged on its sustainability and accessibility to small groups of people.
http://www.swsbm.com/HOMEPAGE/Anarcho-herbalism.html

As for my definition of Marxism, Marxism, as we know, is a failure. Of course the Socialist revolutions of the early 20th century were important in their contributions to shorter work days, etc., all kinds of things we take for granted today in modern post-industrial countries.

But the issue here is defining those features that make Marxism an unsuitable political philosophy for Buddhists. Its advocacy of violence is one reason, the trenchant materialism of the majority of Marxist philosophers is another.

We really do need to get beyond these eighteenth and nineteenth century political models. That is what Deep Ecology is for.

Malcolm wrote:
If you participate in a violent revolution, advocating its aims, causing people, etc., to die, you will assuredly take rebirth in a lower realm. As Marx states:

The purposeless massacres perpetrated since the June and October events, the tedious offering of sacrifices since February and March, the very cannibalism of the counterrevolution will convince the nations that there is only one way in which the murderous death agonies of the old society and the bloody birth throes of the new society can be shortened, simplified and concentrated, and that way is revolutionary terror.
https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1848/11/06.htm

There can never be any harm to anyone through following ahimsa. Non-violent struggles based on ahimsa will never bring harm to anyone. People engaged in non-violent protest may be harmed, but such protest will never being harm to others.

Then there is the knotty issue of associating with people who have a negative view of Buddhadharma. It is not consistent with one's commitment of refuge to the Sangha to associate with those who are hostile or negative towards Buddhadharma. Therefore, since Marxism is avowedly an enemy of Dharma, as it is the enemy of all religion, it is not appropriate for Buddhists to belong to Marxist political parties (indeed, it is probably better we don't belong to any political parties at all).

In the Kalacakra daytime and nighttime yogas, the so-called "visions" are not described as "visions" but as signs (rtags).

Malcolm wrote:
Tagtsang Lotsawa makes the argument, and a very interesting one at that -- he asserts that if wisdom is not the basis, the visions of pratyāhāra will not arise. He then states it is because wisdom is merged with emptiness that the visions can arise:
"Great bliss and empty forms [śunyatābimba, stong gzugs] are shown to exist in the basis with this wisdom element of the basis [gzhi]...and it is established through the citation of the root text and commentary of “wisdom merged into emptiness." The reasoning is that it is because the visions of the empty forms when mediating on withdrawal [pratyāhāra, so sor sdud pa] and so on will therefore be without a cause."
I find this to be a credible account for explaining the genesis of thogal visions as well.

Mipham states in his commentary on the Wisdom Chapter of Kalacakra (as translated by Ives Waldo):
Depending on the great perfection, the path of thod rgal is still a procedure of the completion stage that involves effort. In general establishing the kāya of illusion etc. teaches the display [rtsal] of the illusory body, a teaching which also arises in the father tantras and in the mother tantras. Depending on bliss and bindu, it is taught relying on luminous display. In the Dzogchen tantras there is insight from emptiness the natural state, the wisdom of reality. From mere direct resting in luminous appearance, the conventions of the illusory body etc. are taught.

In all these [teachings], by practicing the intrinsic radiance of the luminous nature of mind as the special pith of the quick path of mantra, both dharmakāya and rūpakāya, in their respective ways are made into real objects, and one seems to enter into them. However, by the distinction of [this experience] having or not having subtle contaminations of karmic prā.na, whichever it may be, there is the ultimate of all completion stages, the effortless great perfection, the secret path of the Oral Instruction Class, up to the four appearances of thod rgal, with paths ever higher and higher, the vast way of attaining truth that cannot be taken away. There is that explanation, but it is not presented by many writings.

I agree that the daytime yoga in Kalacakra is not thogal, but they even describe buddhaforms showing up in the center of thigles, use of postures and gazes, etc.

Of course there are differences in the two systems, but it is my present opinion (which could change tomorrow based on some reliably datable text) that it is unlikely that thogal developed until after the Kalacakra was introduced to Tibet (1027). My speculation is that these entopic visions were given a context by the elaborate internal anatomy presented in Kalacakra, and this was further developed by yogis in Dzogchen circles.

Well, it does seem that capitalism is inherently unstable and leads to crises. Those crises' also seem to be affecting the whole world. Globalisation, the power of corporations seems to be expanding, and overides democracy and morality and common sense. As one stock market trader said, "Goldman Sachs Rules The World". Another way of saying that is "He who pays the piper calls the tune."

I think if we want to change how we produce things and use the planets resources, then we can not leave our economic system in the hands of such people. You can't control what you don't own... so ownership needs to be collective.. (at least when it comes to the important/big things). That does not mean owning everything or every small/medium business.

Malcolm wrote:
Marx considered capitalism progressive. One of the glaring failures of Marx's theories was his failure to perceive that the industrial capitalist mode of production itself was and is the core of the problem. But not all capitalist enterprise suffers from that because not all capitalist enterprise is necessarily industrial.

Competition, even in capitalism, is not necessarily a negative thing, either. For example, my point of view is "anti-capitalist", but not universally so. A certain amount of capitalism in an economy is necessary, it keeps people invigorated. Even the Buddha supported the notion of profitable investing.

It is not a question of fixing capitalism. We already have the means to control it, we simply need to be diligent about making sure that capitalism is properly regulated in ensure the healthy competition upon which it is based. For example, Obama administration's claim that this or that bank is too big to fail is utter nonsense. On the other hand, we need to guarantee small banks.

The fact of the matter is that we already have the means and understanding the balance the social good against the excesses of capitalism. The pity is that you Marxists spend all your time reading Marx, but he is really just tearing a page out of Smith and trying to merge that with Hegel. Marx is a remarkably unoriginal thinker, with a journalists mentality. You should read Smith, thoroughly. His concept of capitalism is really well thought out and socially as well as environmentally sound in many respects. He in fact would be horrified at the modern corporatocracies we are spawning today. He writes very scathingly of those who speculate in the stock market.

However, Smith's views are also unduly enthusiastic about the newly forming industrial economy, and he too, like Marx later, fails to see that the very means of production themselves drive economic forms of life and therefore, drives politics.

The Luddites understood this quite well, and revolted because of the destruction of cottage industries (which in part arose because of the shuttering of the commons on the 16th and 17th centuries, forced a lot of subsistence level farmers in the British Isles into the trades) that occurred as a result of the burgeoning textile mills.

One of the main points of Deep Ecological thinking is that how we make things is as important as what we make. Centralized production leads to centralized economies. Industrial production is summum bonum of centralized production.

If we want to change our politics, we must change our economy. If we want to change our economy, we must change how we manufacture what we need. If we want to change how we manufacture goods, we must in the end change ourselves.

The Marxist solution is bankrupt precisely because it proposes that all we need to change is our politics and policies, and then everything else will fall into place. This sadly, is the great shortcoming of the Green Parties, who have become little more than a retread of the old left, ala Social Ecology (Murray Bookchin), attempting to foster change at the policy level, rather than at the root, how we manufacture and produce what we use and eat.

Your becoming the agent of actions

And:
Those who act at others insistence,
Are called fools on this earth.
There is no one else at all 
So dependent on others as you.
He also says, v. 88:
The sensible do not acquire kingship.
Since fools have no compassion, 
These merciless rulers of men, 
though protectors, are irreligious.
As far as enlightened rulership goes, he opines that while once it may have been possible, it is no longer possible, v. 90 states:
Virtuous rulers of the past
Protected the people like children.
Through the practices of this time of strife,
It is now like a waste without wildlife.

I certainly think that history has certainly demonstrated that rulers, especially sovereign monarchs, are in general completely incompetent. The ideal of the wise, awakened kings is a myth, like the unicorn.

No it doesn't. There are many nuances about democracy as it exists today that don't exist in monarchy. For one, the king is elected by those who have a real stake in the value of the kingdom, not everyone you can find (definitely no baby suffrage here).

Malcolm wrote:
Athenian Democracy for example, was the province of an elite, a practice initially followed by the framers of the constitution who were unwilling or unable to fully implement the Seven Nations model of direct democracy they had encountered and admired. This also likely had to do with a conflict created by culturally embedded European notions of property rights inherited from the Romans as opposed to First Nation ideas about usufruct rights.

Totalitarianism is a scourge, whether it is in the form of a Marxist regime or a Fascist corporatist regime.

Or that the terms vata, pitta, and kapha (which are in fact rlung, mkhris pa and bad kan) are used in sutras and tantras such as Suvarnaprabhāsa, Kālacakra, etc?

The principle difference between classical Ayurveda and Tibetan Medicine is their view: Ayurveda is based on the Saṃkhya school, Tibetan medicine is based on Buddhist sutras, tantras as well as Ayurveda treatises composed by Buddhists such as Vagbhata (author of the Aṣṭāñga hṛidāya samhita), Nāgārjuna and so on. But they both use share the schemes of the tridośa (nyes pa gsum), saptadhātus (lus bzung bdun pa), etc.

As such, they are theoretically nearly identical. In fact, the chapters on mental illness the four tantras are cribbed nearly word for word from the Aṣṭaṇgahṝdayasaṃhita.

The well-being and flourishing of human and nonhuman life on Earth have value in themselves (synonyms: intrinsic value, inherent value). These values are independent of the usefulness of the nonhuman world for human purposes.
Richness and diversity of life forms contribute to the realization of these values and are also values in themselves.
Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital human needs.
The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantial decrease of the human population. The flourishing of nonhuman life requires such a decrease.
Present human interference with the nonhuman world is excessive, and the situation is rapidly worsening.
Policies must therefore be changed. These policies affect basic economic, technological, and ideological structures. The resulting state of affairs will be deeply different from the present.
The ideological change is mainly that of appreciating life quality (dwelling in situations of inherent value) rather than adhering to an increasingly higher standard of living. There will be a profound awareness of the difference between big and great.
Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation directly or indirectly to try to implement the necessary changes.

Lapis on the other thand is very clearly the stone called mu men (མུ་མེན). Please consult འཁྲུངས་དཔེ་དྲི་མེད་ཤེལ་གྱི་མེ་ལོན་ -- this is the standard text reference for materia medica used in Tibetan Medical colleges.

Your reference about beryl is possible, but not definitive.

I should also add, that the word is a generic name for gems that are very shiny and catch light in very specific ways, for example, cat's eye (chrysoberyl) is also called Vaidurya.

Theravada Abhidhamma is completely irrelevant to discussions regarding Madhyamaka, Yogacara, Vajrayāna, Mahāyāna and so on.

In any case, none of what you describe demonstrates that formless realm beings are capable of more than a single cognition during their lifespans.

In fact, your citation merely supports this view, "While a mind-door process can also take any of the five sense data as object, mental object is listed to show its distinctive datum", this means that a sense organ related to the sense datum is required for the requisite cognition of that object to take place. The mind operates through any of the six indriyas, taking the name of that sense gate when it is operating through that sense gate. But the mind cannot smell a form when it is operating through the eye gateway. Since formless realm beings only have a mental indriya, they do not perceive any material objects and since they have no input, they only cognize the concept that propels their rebirth.

If you want to prove this view of the Sautrantikas incorrect, you have some work to do.

It is better to study Abhidharma if you want to understand the context of Indian Buddhism.

Abhidharmakoshabhasyam, AFAIK, there is no different explanation given in Yogacara or for that matter in the Abhidharmasammucaya. You can understand it in the following way: without physical organs, the mental organ can only have a single object present before it, the thought that propels its rebirth into that āyatana.

You see, this is why people should study Vasubandhu in detail -- then they will have less proliferation and speculation about many things.

M

Sherab Dorje said:
Vasubandhu is merely one take on the matter.  Acariya Sangaha states in the Abhidhammattha Sangaha (2000), p152 that for a mind process to occur the one needs the following conditions to be present:

1)The heart base (hadayavatthu)*
2)A mental object (dhammarammana)
3)The bhavanga
4)Attention

*"For the mind-door process, the heart-base is only required in those realms where matter is found. While
a mind-door process can also take any of the five sense data as object, mental object is listed to show its
distinctive datum."

He goes on to say that:  "The six types of cognitive processes are conveniently divided into two groups —
(1) the five-door process (pañcadvāravīthi), which includes the five processes occurring
at each of the physical sense doors; and (2) the mind-door process (manodvāravīthi),
which comprises all processes that occur solely at the mind door. Since the bhavanga is
also the channel from which the five-door processes emerge, the latter is sometimes
called “mixed door processes” (missaka-dvāravīthi), inasmuch as they involve both the
mind door and a physical sense door. The processes that occur solely at the mind door
are then called “bare mind door processes” (suddha-manodvāravīthi), since they emerge
from the bhavanga alone without the instrumentality of a physical sense door. As will be
seen, the first five processes all follow a uniform pattern despite the difference in the
sense faculty through which they occur, while the sixth comprises a variety of processes
that are alike only in that they occur independently of the external sense doors. "

I see your proliferation and speculation and raise you a pedantry.

That is one view/theory.  From my understanding Theravadins put the mind as a sense organ at the same level as the other five, yet a component in the functioning of the "material" sensory process too.

In both systems, manovijn̄ānadhātu arises from the contact of the mano-indriya dhātu and the dharmadhātu.

12 āyatanas, the manoāyatana covers all sense perceptions because the emphasis is different.

In brief, the emphasis of the presentation of 5 skandhas is on the sense organs, the presentation of the 12 āyatanas emphasizes the sense objects, and the presentation of the 18 dhātus emphasizes the sense consciousnesses.

When for example the manodhātu meets an object that is part of dharmadhātu, a manovijñāna is generated. Before a vijñāna can be generated, the object must appear to the appropriate sense organ (indriya).

When the cakṣudhātu meets the rūpadhātu a cakṣuvijñāna is generated. If it were the case that there are only mental objects any sense consciousness could arise from any sense objects, for example, cognition of smell could arise from the eye dhātu meeting the form dhātu, etc.

It is not the intention of Madhyamaka to undermine this or that conventional presentation of the skandhas, dhātus and āyatanas, but merely to show that they are not paramārtha dharmas.

Of course, as I said, if you prefer to follow the Yogacara presentation of conventional truth that's ok with me, but it was rejected by Candra.

In reality, the term in Sanskrit is punarbhāva, which literally means "repeated existence".

For eternalists, this "repeated existence" happens because of an essence, as you rightly observe. For us, it happens because of continuing nexus of action and affliction. In both case, a body is appropriated repeatedly, hence they are both theories of reincarnation. In both cases, one is born repeatedly, hence they are both theories of rebirth.

He cannot even have the appearance of color. We can see color, he cannot. We can see color because all three things required for a cognition of color are present, an undeluded mind, a healthy sense organ and an external object.

Malcolm wrote:
A mind will not  find any appearances independent of itself, since it is axiomatic that all appearances to a mind belong to that mind, whether veridical or deluded.

On the other hand it is clear Candra accepts external things from the following statement in the commentary to Intro to the Middle Way: "The intrinsic nature of all external things is of two types, relative and ultimate."

Since a cognition of an object (which is what an appearance is) cannot arise in absence of an object external to the mind (according to Candra, recall any sense cognition requires the meeting of three things, a mind, an organ and object), it is suitable to infer that there are phenomena external to the mind, such as thunderstorms and so on. Even in the case of the appearance of the six realms there must be an object (for example, a liquid) which can form the basis of the six kinds of imputations of water, ambrosia, etc.

As far as I am personally concerned, it matters little to me whether you wish to take the Yogacara view of relative truth, which you are advocating here, or the Sautrantika view  of relative truth which is the POV advocated by most Indian Madhyamakas including Candra (for whom objects are held to be external to the mind arising through their own causes and conditions, albeit not necessarily karmic causes and conditions).

I already clarified that for Yogacara in general all appearances are generated by the activation of traces from past karma. It is a nice theory, but not one that finds much favor in Madhyamaka until Shantarakshita's Yogacara Madhyamaka synthesis.

how do you square that with the fact that when you search for something with wisdom, it vanishes? If something is not merely an appearance, it would be found upon investigation.


Malcolm wrote:
According to your school (Gelug), the only thing that vanishes in that instance is the mistaken perception of inherent existence, but not the conventional appearance of a given phenomena which is posited as necessary in order in order for its emptiness to be established.

According to Madhyamaka in general, there may indeed be no appearances during equipoise, but in post-equipoise, of course there are appearances (which are illusory and unreal).

ajohn4717 said:
A gross misunderstanding of about Buddhism exists today, especially in the notion of reincarnation. The common misunderstanding is that a person has led countless previous lives, usually as an animal, but somehow in this life he is born as a human being and in the next life he will be reborn as an animal, depending on the kind of life he has lived.

This misunderstanding arises because people usually do not know-how to read the sutras or sacred writings. It is said that the Buddha left 84,000 teachings; the symbolic figure represents the diverse backgrounds characteristics, tastes, etc. of the people. The Buddha taught according to the mental and spiritual capacity of each individual. For the simple village folks living during the time of the Buddha, the doctrine of reincarnation was a powerful moral lesson. Fear of birth into the animal world must have frightened many people from acting like animals in this life. If we take this teaching literally today we are confused because we cannot understand it rationally.


Malcolm wrote:
Of course reincarnation or rebirth can be understood rationally. As a matter of fact, the four kinds of realized persons (stream enterers, etc.) are defined precisely by how many lives they must undergo until they attain nirvana.

So ultimately the practice of the path still depends on cause and effect.

If someone has no contact in the past, and hence can't even hear the word Dzogchen in this life, that would means they will never ever be able to hear it in future lives. I didn't know there are teachings on icchantikas in Dzogchen. Just kidding - but I am sure you have thought of this illogical loop before?
There are all kinds of ways devised to ensure the beings contact with Dzogchen teachings. And the Dzogchen tantras themselves assert that all sentient beings will be liberated in the end, so no, Dzogchen does not support the concept of icchantikas.

I am afraid this is just pious fiction. Sraddha and jnana are not cognate, or relates that way. The success rate is just not very high.

Your suffering is the ripening of your karma. There is nothing you can do about suffering you are presently experiencing or have experienced. There is something you can do about the suffering you have yet to experience, but it does not involve complicated schemes involving purification of infinite past causes of suffering.  Even if you could purify the causes of suffering for 10 to the 100th power of past lives, the amount of causes for suffering left over dwarf this number.

I already addressed this issue above, where I clarified that attaining a precious human birth certainly comes from gathering merit, etc.

In Dzogchen, buddhahood does not come from mind. The Dzogchen perspective is that a liberation based on causes and effects is incoherent.

Dzogchen is a path where one abides in liberation, even if those moments of liberation are incredibly brief:
The suffering of samsara, cannot be removed by using this stake of grasping
but will be removed if [the stake is] let go. 
If fabricated phenomena are abandoned, one will achieve relaxation.
Abandoning all thoughts, the ocean of wisdom does not stir.
