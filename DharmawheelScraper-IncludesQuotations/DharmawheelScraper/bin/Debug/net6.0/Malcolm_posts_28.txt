A genuine insight is one that removes (some) ignorance and delusion. Are you saying that this is impossible outside formal Buddhist practice?

Malcolm wrote:
Of course there is such thing as mundane insight, for example, insight into the workings of a bee colony, the psyche of human beings, etc.

But what we are discussing here is liberative insight, which puts an end to birth in samsara. That does exist outside the pale of Budddhadharma.

The Mahāyāna Aśaiksamarge, path of no more learning, is the 11th bhumi. The realization of emptiness of a first stage bodhisattva is the same as that of a buddha. The difference between bhumis is the presence or absence of fetters and the gradual increase of omniscience. These latter are qualities of cultivation.

Seeker12 said:
When you say cultivation, is it correct that the path of cultivation consists basically of volition that is oriented towards actualizing the dharmakaya, and that volition is essentially always simply oriented in that one direction, but the Bhumis are basically what is actualized, which is the progressive unfoldment of the sort of ‘manifest’ aspect of awakened mind combined with increasingly refined insight into the nature of what is manifest?

So, that volition is different than samsaric volition, which does nothing but shift from ‘dream’ to dream without integrating this activity with the perception of great emptiness? This also concords with the Ariyamagga Sutta in the distinction between the karma of an Arya vs even samsaric ‘good’ karma.

The key breakdown in Western thought, was the loss of the idea of 'the uncreated'. (This idea is still represented in Buddhism as 'the unconditioned/unborn'. That is *not* to conflate Western theistic ideas of 'the uncreated' with the Buddhist 'unborn' as the two traditions are very different.  But it's that in pre-modern Western philosophy at least the idea of the 'uncreated' was preserved, whereas from late medieval times it has largely become completely forgotten and obscured. Whereas, in Buddhist philosophy, it is sill understood.

Note this passage from the SEP entry on Schopenhauer:
It is a perennial philosophical reflection that if one looks deeply enough into oneself, one will discover not only one’s own essence, but also the essence of the universe. For as one is a part of the universe as is everything else, the basic energies of the universe flow through oneself, as they flow through everything else. For that reason it is thought that one can come into contact with the nature of the universe if one comes into substantial contact with one’s ultimate inner being.
of course, Buddhism doesn't utilise this 'essentialist' terminology, but otherwise, the 'no-nature' of the Universe and the 'no-nature' of the Buddha, signifies a rather similar insight.

Malcolm wrote:
Schopenhauer was deeply influenced by Vedanta. No wonder you like him, he wrote, ""In the whole world there is no study so beneficial and so elevating as that of the Upanishads. It has been the solace of my life, it will be the solace of my death.”

There is no way one can equate the anti-substantialism of Buddhadharma with the idealism of Schopenhauer, or Vedanta. It is just intellectually lazy to think they can be equated.

This may be beyond the scope of this forum, but ... I'm not sure if I can frame/express this right but we'll see.

Generally, at the 8th Bhumi, it seems that the Bodhisattva is beyond birth and death, although there is still sort of a 'show' of it.

Malcolm wrote:

Seeker12 said:
In Dzogchen, there are the various types of attainment, for lack of a better word, such as the body of light/rainbow body, and there are teachings that basically say that one will realize Buddhahood in this lifetime, in the intermediate state, etc.

If one attains the result of the Great Perfection in this life, this sack of meat directly reverts into its original nature as the light of pristine consciousness.

Yes.

In other words, might it be that one realizes the rainbow body at the 8th Bhumi and there still is the sort of 'show' of the pure bhumis, but functionally it's sort of 'one life' given that there really isn't death any more, or birth for that matter?

No one realizes great transference body on the eighth bhumi. That only happens for those on the highest stage of buddhahood, the 13th bhumi.

There's only one place I've seen that spelled out, and that is in the book by Traleg Kyabgon Rinpoche, published in some places as Luminous Mind, and others as Mind at Ease:
In Buddhism, we distinguish between spiritual experiences and spiritual realizations. Spiritual experiences are usually more vivid and intense than realizations because they are generally accompanied by physiological and psychological changes. Realizations, on the other hand, may be felt, but the experience is less pronounced. Realization is about acquiring insight. Therefore, while realizations arise out of our spiritual experiences, they are not identical to them. Spiritual realizations are considered vastly more important because they cannot fluctuate.

The distinction between spiritual experiences and realizations is continually emphasized in Buddhist thought. If we avoid excessively fixating on our experiences, we will be under less stress in our practice. Without that stress, we will be better able to cope with whatever arises, the possibility of suffering from psychic disturbances will be greatly reduced, and we will notice a significant shift in the fundamental texture of our experience.

Malcolm wrote:
The best definition of "realization" ( rtogs pa, avabodha ) I have ever head is from Lama Karma, presently living at Tara Mandala. He defined realization as the the combination of experience ( nyams su myong ba, anubhāva ) and understanding ( go ba, vijñā ).

For a quarter-century (!) I and one other person have periodically discussed these or similar questions with one of the world's leading Vedanta scholars, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=usu_cLGXLg4&t=965s. At the end of the day, I can only concur with Nyoshul Khen Rinpoche and certain other Dzogchen masters before him, that what we call "Dzogchen" is what others call "connate wisdom", "great bliss", "Buddha-nature", or "Atman", or "God" and so on.

So is there a subtle difference or not? I think there are subtle differences of understanding, according to individual karma. There are also differences in terminology used to indicate "non-duality". But no such description can ever be axiomatic, unless we are willing to accept the finger that points at the moon as the moon itself.

Malcolm wrote:
No one reports any experiences that resemble the experience of the direct perception of dharmatā outside of the teachings of the Dzogchen, because outside the teachings of Dzogchen, the subject to be experienced (dharmatā) and the means of experiencing it (direct perception) are not known at all, not even in Anuyoga.

Malcolm wrote:
He is referring to an old conversation we had about the value of evangelizing Buddhism (a huge Nichiren concern).

My point of view is that people meet the Dharma or not because they have the causes to meet it or not, and no amount of evangelizing or proselytizing is of any value.

Thus, Q thinks this POV is "Calvinist," i.e. only the elect will be saved. He is more in favor of active evangelizing the Gospel and proselytizing among the heathen, hence "Mormon."

If Nagarjuna when referring to the nature of the Tathagata used rang bzhin to mean ngo bo, wouldn't he have committed the fallacy of equivocation in the quotation?

The implied proposition is, what people are a calling "Atman" and so on--even if they do not understand what it is -- is what Dzogchen calls "mind nature". That is not so far-fetched. Take "mind nature" as metonymic for tsal, and the proposition is that much more plausible.

Well, given that Shankara is one of the 60 teachers identified as promulgating wrong view in the Self-Arisen VIdyā Tantra, it would be very surprising to learn of any so called khenpo of Dzogchen claiming that Atman was just a Hindu name for the mind essence. You yourself admit the idea does not even exist in their system.

Here's an article on Kant's usage: http://www.academia.edu/15156078/Kant_on_Essence_and_Nature

But of course the distinction predates Kant. Nor is Kant's distinction the only one: both terms, "essence" and "nature," have their history, and so does their difference (or, for that matter, identity). For a different take, read Spinoza's Ethics.

If you want to trace their development, you need to start with Plato and Aristotle and go through the scholastics into modernity -- but to be perfectly honest I do not think that it will get you any closer to understanding the difference between ngo-bo and rang-bzhin (if that is what you want, that is).

In the context of Dzogchen teachings, ngo-bo is called "essence" because in the Occident "essence" has often been used to denote either the main defining property of a thing or a being (that which makes it what it is, that which makes X X and not Y, the xness of an x) or even the substance of a thing or a being (that which it is made of or consists in) -- whereas rang-bzhin would be rendered as "nature" because "nature" has often been employed in the West to refer to what a thing or a being does because of its being what it is (or how a thing or a being can be known to be what it is).

A still greater oversimpliciation: the "essence" of a thing answers the question "What is it really?," whereas the "nature" answers such questions as "What does it do?," "What is it like?," "How does it behave?," etc.

A trained philosopher will be very unhappy at that point, but I think it might help you.

To Mr. Malcom:
That Buddha did not teach diet as a path of liberation is highly debatable. At least in "Food for Bodhisattvas" by Shakbar you can many citations, even by (that is academically debatable) Buddha Shakyamuni. E.g. Lankavatara Sutra (version with additional chapter). Even in Hinayana texts he obviously mentions that food should be pure in three ways. So, although is definitely not vegetarianism, he DID in fact teach some diet restriction and understood food restrictions as part of the path.

Malcolm wrote:
It is not even slightly debatable.

Why? If it were the case that diet was a factor in liberation, no one who ate meat would ever have attained liberation, let alone buddhahood, including the Buddha. Since many meat eaters have indeed attained liberation and even buddhahood, it is quite clear that the Buddhist path to liberation has nothing to do with what kind of food one puts in one's mouth.

That said I second the suggestion of arranging a proper lung. Would be of great benefit to many.

Malcolm wrote:
Pewang means you can read it; lung means you have received the transmission.  There are exceptions, however.

Do you know how long it would approximately take for such a Lung to be transmitted ?
A few days ? A week ? More ?

May be could / should we try, as a virtual sangha, to make such a transmission happen...
It woud be such a source of merits...

It takes approximately 5 days for the lung of the 17 tantras. Any senior Nyingma Lama can grant this lung. Probably the best people to receive it from at present are Dzongsar Khyentse, Namkhai Nyingpo Rinpoche or Sangye Nyenpa Rinpoche (who is actually a Kagyu master). This is not to exclude the many excellent lamas who can also give this lung, such as Khenchen Namdrol, etc.

Also, while I'm at it: I am reading your introduction to the Rigpa Rangshar right now. Note 26 mentions that Rlung is routinely mistranslated as prana.  This is very interesting to me.  For years I've only ever heard tsa, lung, and tigle equals nadi, prana, and bindu in Sanskrit. Is this incorrect in the tsa lung context as well as in the Dzogchen context?

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, this is incorrect in every context. It is properly: nāḍī, vāyu, and bindu.

Prāṇa is translated as srog. Thus, prāṇavāyu is translated into Tibetan as srog 'dzin rlung, i.e., life-sustaining vāyu.

I also have noticed the term prana used in the context of the 4 empowerments within ngondro practice texts (specifically connected with the 2nd empowerment). Should this be vayu across the board?  Very interesting indeed.

tha might be just another one of my stupid questions, but i remember that Shakyamunni did attained perfect knowledge far before -more or less- 3.000 years ago (so it is stated in the Lotus Sutra). And also, will GP's emanations take birth as enlighted or they have had, or will, pay attention like everyone else until "rediscovers" the base?. I could go on several arguments in this way.

it is true that birth of realized ones is not conditioned by Karma, but it is certain that they become conditioned by it until they realize the base  again...

And then, in case we don't "rediscover" -and do discover- the basis ¿wouldn't that exclude pure vision from our real nature since a beginningless time?

if an emanation of GP is so, then i'm asking that. I'm not wondering if higher -than the bhumis- realizations allows voluntary rebirth, but if a "cover" of nature occurs for it to happen, and if we all already under such "cover" then prior to that we must have had knowledge of uncovered basis meaning that we all are, in the real sense, perfect Buddhas and not only have an impure appeareance, but also that means that at some point we was in the primordial knowledge and then somehow after a voluntary rebirth we got stuck-conditioned.

Malcolm wrote:
Bodhisattvas on the impure stages have very strong traces for meeting the Dharma.When they take rebirth, the force of past realization causes them to enter the path and continue up to and beyond the realization they had before.

Emanations do not forget or need to re-realize anything, and this is also true of eight stage bodhisattvas and beyond. According to one account, a buddha is conscious when they die, in the womb, and during birth; a bodhisattva on the stages is conscious when they die, in the womb, but become unconscious at birth, while sentient beings are unconscious when the die, are in the womb, and at birth.

In Dzogchen texts there are three stages generally described: recognition, realization, and liberation.

Some people think the third statement means full integration, but it does not. It means that the practitioner can continue in the confidence of liberation because they have previously decided one thing. Continuing in the confidence of liberation means that one has true knowledge of one's primordial state and therefore, with this knowledge, one's liberation is no longer in issue in terms of inevitability, it is only an issue of whether it occurs in this life, the time of death, the bardo, or a natural nirmanakāya buddhafield.

Malcolm wrote:
I did not confirm that that Dzogchen emerged "outside" of the creation stage. I confirmed that the  milieu in which Dzogchen arose regarded the creation stage as optional, meaning that it was not necessary for everyone. For whom is the creation stage not necessary, according to those who belonged to this milieu? Those who immediately understood the meaning and were liberation through that understanding. Everyone else was recommended to practice the indirect approach, as Mañjuśṛīmitra states:

Furthermore, since the teacher has declared that awakening can be correctly grasped with a symbol,
in that case, this is the basis of the meditation that generates awakened mind. 
After the three samadhis are stable and after binding the three symbolic mudras, 
generate the mind as the great dharmamudra and meditate the recitation of the essence [mantra].

"Optional" does not mean deciding that you want salad instead of fries with your burger. "Optional" means that if one does not wake up immediately into full buddhahood through receiving Dzogchen transmissions, there are many practices with which one works with concepts to overcome concepts, like the creation and completion stages, and various other kinds of preliminary practices in Dzogchen such as yogas that work with vāyu, conceptual analysis, and so on. These are options of which the practitioner can avail themselves. BTW, your allergy to conceptual practices is entirely conceptual.

If this is accurate, does that mean the rigpa of every sentient being has this prayer at heart and thus, eventually, all sentient beings will become enlightened?

Malcolm wrote:
The Aspiration of Great Power is a liberation through hearing text. The context of the aspiration is that all sentient beings have the same basis for either recognizing or not recognizing the nature of the mind, and thus, either waking up or not waking up.

It explains how the energy of delusion-based afflictions can become the energy of knowledge-based qualities through recognizing the innate nature of this or that affliction to be a pristine consciousness, thus purifying the associated realm (hell realm, etc.).

You do not understand the context of Longchenpa's classification system. For example, in the Shing rta chen mo, when he analyzes, mahāyoga, he says:


The Śṛī Guhysamāja, Mañjuśr̄i Yamantaka, etc. are the yoga tantras called "mahāyoga." These principally teach the creation stage, the aspect of method, and their completion stage is vāyu. Saṃsiddhi (yang dag), Vajrakīlaya, Cakrasamvara, Hevajra, and so on, are wisdom or mother tantras, called "anuyoga." These principally teach the wisdom and the completion stage. Also with respect to the completion stage, since they employ the bindu of the bodhicitta element, they assert [the completion stage to be] the pristine consciousness of nonconceptual bliss and emptiness. The nondual tantras are Mahāmayajala tantras and so on, called "Atiyoga." They principally teach the union of creation and completion, the essence of inseparable method and wisdom. Their completion stage is asserted to be the great pristine consciousness of bliss, clarity, nonconceptuality, and unconceivable luminosity that is arises from nāḍīs, vāyu, and bindu.

We understand that he is classifying the Guhyagarbha within Mahāyoga, because he says:

Within mahāyoga tantras, [mahā] mahā emphasizes vaȳu, the creation stage, and method. [Mahā] anu emphasizes the element, completion stage, and wisdom. [Mahā]ati emphasizes that everythiing is nondual pristine consciousness. Further, all phenmoena are uniform from the start. Practice by recognizing this to be so.

Further, in the Treasury of Philosophical Positions, the five early lungs of translated by Vairocana, the thirteen lungs translated by Vimalamitra, the Kun byed rgyal po, the rmad du byung ba and the mdo bcu are mentioned, but no mention of Guhyagarbha. A number of klong sde tantras are mentioned, and a whole slew of intimate instruction series tantras are mentioned, but there is no mention at all of the Guhyagarbha. With respect to the unsurpassed secret cycle, the seventeen tantras are mentioned, as well as their ancillary literature, but there is no mention of the Guhyagarbha at all. Thus, there is no evidence for you assertion that the Guhyagarbha is to be accepted as an ati ati level tantra, let alone a tantra of the unsurpassed secret cycle. There are a whole number of reasons why this is so, and I am quite sure that Khen Rinpoche would be in accord with my perspective on this, since it is in fact Longchenpa's own perspective.

Further, in the Ngal skor gsum as well as the Treasury of Philosophical Positions, the Vajrasattvamayajala tantras are listed as belonging to the mind tantras that form part of mahāyoga, with the root tantra of all mahāyoga tantras listed as Guhyasamāja. But no where, in any list of atiyoga tantras, apart from the mahā ati division of mahāyoga, is the Guhyagarbha mentioned in any list of tantras.

Thus, while it is true that Longchenpa wrote his commentary on the Guhyagarbha from the perspective of general Ati yoga on the basis of the Rosary of Views by Guru Rinpoche, and the commentary on the Guhyagarbha authored by Suryasimaphrabha (a very interesting text), he did not consider the text in and of itself a tantra belonging the 6.4 million slokas of the Great Perfection taught by Garab Dorje.

It is not so, from a text critical POV. The earliest, datable text we possess that uses the term “Dzogchen” is the Guhyagarbha, a tantra belonging to the mahayoga class.

What we can say for sure is that what we today call Dzogchen emerged out of a movement in 8th century that regarded the creation stage as optional.

I don’t agree with that. He’s saying the completion stage culminates in a dark retreat which culminates in a rahu mandala and all the visions unfold naturally up to great perfection vidhyadhara. Specifically in Ch 15 the wrathful mandala places it in the unsurpassed secret.

Malcolm wrote:
It is possible to clarify the lower by means of the higher, but one cannot elevate the lower to the higher. As for the dark practice recommended in this passage, it is based on the Kalacakra approach of the saḍaṅgayoga, not the dark practice of the Great Perfection. Why? Because it mentions the five signs, etc., fireflies, butterlamps, etc.

As for your contention, no, this chapter does not place place the tantra in the unsurpassed secret cycle, and Longchenpa himself would never make such a claim.

Why? There are two faults here: one, the teaching that the deities exist in the body with faces and hands a) does not go beyond mahāyoga in general; and with respect to the outer, inner, secret, and unsurpassed secret cycles, this assertion belongs to the secret cycle, not the unsurpassed secret cycle.

Crazywisdom said:
I’m sure he did make this claim and so did Khenpo Namdrol. The Kalacakra is not the only place these signs are described, also the Guhyasamaja. He is not saying the deities abide as faces and hands but as bindis of light like mustard seeds in the crown. This is the all-in-one tantra that covers all the bases.

Malcolm wrote:
No, Longchenpa never made this claim in the text of the commentary itself.

As for the signs under discussion, they are rejected in Dzogchen as being mental phenomena, not phenomena of pristine consciousness. You can consult Dudjom R's big red book on this point.

There isn't even a single mention of the topics of the unsurpassed secret cycle, let alone the four bindu cycles, the three series, etc. There are only one or two mentions of the Great Perfection in the root tantra. Commenting on this tantra from a Great Perfection perspective does not make it a great perfection tantra. It is a mahāyoga tantra being commented upon from a Nyinthig POV. Someone who never encountered Nyinthig would have no idea Longchenpa is talking about in this commentary at all. Mipham states:

Crazywisdom said:
Because this tantra is classified as the
Ati or highest division of Mahayoga. it is essentially
identical to the Maha classification of Atiyoga, among the
three divisions of the Great Perfection. For in the secret
Great Perfection there are three categories of teaching,
namely that which reveals the mandala in which creation &
perfection are indivisible and mind & pristine cognition are
manifest in themselves, that which reveals mind-as-such to
be the natural expression of primordial buddhahood without
regard for creation or perfection. and that which reveals
pristine cognition in its essence. manifesting in and of
itself as the nature of buddhahood. them. this
exposition sccords with the first.

Malcolm wrote:
-- Gyurme Dorje's thesis.


In other words, what is being claimed here is that when Mahāyoga is subdivided, there is mahā mahā, mahā anu, and mahā ati. And within Ati, there is ati mahā; ati anu, and ati ati.

Clearly, this commentary is commenting from the point of view of the indivisible creation and, with an emphasis on the completion stage. I think you have slightly misunderstood Longchenpa's meaning and purpose here.

Malcolm wrote:
Of course it does. You have to understand the basis for defining a "Hinayāna" in order to understand why this is applicable to the "eighteen schools."

The first basis is the difference in bodhicitta and qualifications for who may aspire to full buddhahood. In Hinayāna schools, the bodhicitta is arhat or pratyekabodhicitta, that is, the wish to attain the stated of awakening of an arhat or pratyekabuddha.

In Theravada, the only people who can generate the bodhicitta for full, perfect buddhahood are those who have been predicted by Gautama Buddha, and who are male.

Mahāyāna, the aspiration is for full buddhahood, and this can be adopted at any time by anyone.

The second basis is training: what is permissible for a śrāvaka is prohibited for a bodhisattva, and what is prohibited for a śrāvaka is permissible for a bodhisattva.

The third basis is emptiness: the Buddha, in the Agamas and Nikayas, did not fully explicated emptiness. Emptiness is only fully explicated in Mahāyāna sūtras.

The fourth basis is the path: the Hinayāna path is the eightfold path, whereas the Mahāyāna path is the path of the six or ten perfections. While the Theravada school borrowed the perfections from Mahāyāna, they are not practiced with full buddhahood in mind.

The fifth basis is differences in method and compassion: the Buddha did not explicate the profound Mahāyāna skillful means nor nonreferential compassion in the Agamas and Nikayas, so these teachings and their corresponding practices are absent in Theravada.

There are many more differences than can be discussed, but this list will already engender unhappy responses, so I will leave it here.

To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.

"He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.

"He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.

"He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.

"He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.

"He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness of his invasions on the rights of the people.

"He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.

"He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.

"He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.

"He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.

"He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.

"He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.

"He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.

"He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:

"For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:

"For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:

"For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:

"For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:

"For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:

"For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies:

"For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:

"For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.

"He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.

"He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.

"He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.

"He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.

Just to put this in practical terms - isn't chattel slavery a form of oppression? How was it not condoned in the Revolution?

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, it is a form of oppression.

The American Revolution did not take place in order to defend slavery as an institution. The vast majority of American soldiers who fought in the Revolution were from New England.

Attitudes towards slavery in Massachusetts, for example, where quite jaundiced and by 1790 there were no slaves in Massachusetts as a result of case law (Walker v. Jennison and Commonwealth v. Jennison). Slavery was abolished ouright in Vermont in 1777. Connecticut began an emancipation process in 1784. Rhode Island abolished slavery in the 17th century, however the legislation was ignored. However, in 1794, it passed a manumission act which led the eventual ending of slavery in that state.

The first and second Continental Armies were composed largely of troops from the New England states. It was only in the third Continental Army where each state was required to send one battalion. Ten percent of the Continental Army was freed slaves.

Queequeg said:
Right.

My impression was that there was more or less a sense in New England that slavery would be tolerated for the sake of getting all the colonies on board but that it would come to a head some day. Is that condoning? Maybe we're splitting hairs at this point.

The union nearly fell apart over slavery after the war. I think it is fairly safe to say that the Revolution was fought to eliminate oppression.

Quay said:
You shoot down your own assertion that people always choose tribes over class with that last sentence. The extremely wealthy have deliberately chosen class over tribes because they do indeed exercise influence over the markets and can move capital wherever they like irrespective of tribes. Just look at the gatherings in Davos or the guest list at any ultra-exclusive resorts of the world. One can even look at European aristocracy over the last five or six centuries and see the trend of crown embracing crown irregardless of who they were before they acquired them.

Having said that it is also true that people without economic mobility will usually choose tribe over class. One of those odd things that makes Marxism a one-size-fails-all kind of solution.

Malcolm wrote:
No, the market does not care what tribe or class to which one claims allegiance. It has no feelings. It doesn't care about anything. It will, as a quasi-organism, always seek to expand to the limits of whatever growth is possible.

The ultra wealthy are not proper class, and often, if not always, move against each other. They are different than the aristocracy, not bound by tribe and family. Sure, they can influence the markets, but it is usually in their best interest not to mess with the markets.

Hi Malcolm, I have been reflecting on this discussion and am still a little bit confused.  I don't offer this as a point of contention but just to broaden my own understanding.

It seems to me perhaps we were talking past each other in that your comments may have been focused around the term "alpha" whereas I am referring to the broader meaning of "alpha-purity" in context.

The "alpha" is a poor choice, for reasons I have already explained.

I'm not necessarily concerned with the use or non-use of the term "alpha" but the overall meaning for my own understanding of the text in context as I am a non-Tibetan reader.

This is true, even if only one person shot the gun or strung the noose.

Certainly it is the case that a number of terms in Dzogchen can be in Sanskrit, such as dharmata for example. But in general the lexicon of Dzogchen is Tibetan, and so one should familiarize oneself with these terms (in Tibetan) and how they are taught by a qualified teacher of Dzogchen, from whom one receives those teachings. That way ones understanding will truly become something useful.

A consensus is being slowly reached, which differs from the Tibetan and Chinese conventions of translating everything. Foreign names, of people and places, for example, should not be translated. Technical terms like samsara and nirvana already exist in the OED. There is room for the importation of terms from Sanskrit, such as dharmakāya, etc., into English, because translations like "truth body" and "law body" inadequately convey the meaning of the original term.

In English dictionaries alpha as a modifier is 'dominant' or 'first'.  I would hope that 'dominant' purity is not the gist - sounds like a battle among purities.

Spelare said:
I mean, in post-Christian cultures and languages, such as those of Western Europe, there's still the echo of the Book of Revelation, "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end."  So, in literary contexts, "alpha" does carry resonances of origin, primacy, priority, and therefore ultimacy.

Nicholas Weeks said:
You cite a good reason that some translators ignore, the several meaning the chosen english word has.  Yes, alpha has a single meaning that seems (to translator) a just dandy fit for the meaning of the Sanskrit, Tibetan, etc. word.  But an English reader will hear the chimes of 'alpha dog' 'alpha Centauri' etc.

Since English is such a 'borrowing' language, (alpha from the Greek sure fits,) then why not incorporate more Buddhist Sanskrit terms if the translator cannot abide prosaic English versions?

Malcolm wrote:
The question is always whether such borrowings are apt. In this case, borrowing "alpha" for "ka" is not apt because there is no way the term can be used to handle the ablative case (which is missing in English, German, and Greek). The ablative case does exist in Latin, however, thus the ablative for "origo" is "orīgine." Of course, if you go to a Latin-English translation tool, and type in originally pure and original purity, you will not derive orīgene in any way from this.

The earliest usage of the term original in middle English was in the phrase, "original sin." Of course, original purity is the very opposite of original sin, and far more reflective of the point being made with this term then the clumsy "alpha."

According to KB in the end notes, ka dag "refers to the original and beginningless purity or emptiness of all phenomenon in general and of rigpa in particular."  That appears to describe how he handles "alpha" (i.e. original and beginningless).

I certainly cannot comment on the translation of ka dag but I was just offering a small juxtaposition to the idea previous in the thread that "alpha" might be understood as "dominant", "first", or the like.  In context, I did not understand it to mean anything along those lines, but I'm also self-admittedly a stickler for reading end notes.  Certainly simply saying something like "original purity" might be clearer, however.  I recognize the importance of words but for the lay reader like myself I think the broader context carries more meaning than the semantics.  For scholars, of course, it may be a different story and I certainly respect that fact.

"Kadag, it means since the beginning pure."  -ChNN

No different from alpha purity.

Malcolm wrote:
Basically, the equivalent is simply bad English grammar.

Here is the problem: ka dag is a contraction of the term "ka nas dag pa", which is a noun formation in the ablative case.

Alpha is just a simple noun modifying 'pure.'

It might seem trivial to you, but then, scores of polemics in Buddhist discourse are based on just such grammatical niceties. In the case, we are dealing with a term that is in fact an adjectival phrase, where the ablative case in Tibetan is rendered as an adjective.

There is no way to properly represent the ablative case with "alpha", mentioned above, because alpha cannot take the adjectival/adverbial "ly" ending. In English, you cannot say "pure from alpha", as this makes no sense at all. You cannot say "alphaly" but you can say "originally" and "primordially," and so on.

"Ka nas" does not mean "from the syllable ka." Ka" is a tibetan noun which means beginning, origin, or first. Its synonyms in Tibetan are rtsa  ba, thog ma, and gdod ma; root, first, or beginning, respectively. Rtsa ba nas, thog ma nas, gdod ma nas, and ka nas are all synonyms in Tibetan, of which the ablative case may easily be rendered in English translation, i.e., from the root, from the first, from the beginning, etc. You can see this work as follows: fundamentally pure (rtsa nas dag pa); thog nas dag (initially pure), gdod nas dag (primordially pure), ka nas dag (originally pure). Or if we are taking the noun to be purity, then, fundamental purity, initial purity, primordial purity, and original purity. Since alpha is not flexible in this respect, it is not really very suitable as term for rendering ka/ka nas. This is the reason I found it to be an odd choice on KB's part, because he is an excellent scholar and a linguist. But it was a bad translation choice when Trungpa first suggested it, and it remains a bad translation choice still.

In verse 6, he says,

"Then, as for extremely subtle entities,
Those who regard them with nihilism,
Lacking precise and thorough knowledge,
Will not see the actuality of conditioned arising."

Can anyone explain this a bit? What is being referred to as extremely subtle entities that may be regarded with nihilism, lacking precise and thorough knowledge?

Thank you for input.


Malcolm wrote:
The extremely subtle existents are particles, paramanus.


A more precise translation would be:

Although the aggregates are serially connected,
the wise are to comprehend nothing transfers.
Someone, having conceived of annihilation,
even in extremely subtle existents,
is not wise,
and will never see the meaning of ‘arisen from conditions’.

The auto commentary states with respect to this:

Therein, the aggregates are the aggregates of matter, sensation, perception, formations and consciousness. Those, called ‘serially joined’, not having ceased, produce another produced from that cause; although not even the subtle particle of an existent has transmigrated from this world to the next.

The purpose of this is to point out that even though nothing transfers from this life to the next, the assertion that even a subtle particle is annihilated is false. Why? Because in Madhyamaka causes and effects are neither the same nor different.

Guru yoga brings claustrophobic experience of TGS. It’s like constant open-heart surgery without anesthetics. Trungpa Rinpoche described guru yoga as a form of rape: you’re being raped by the lineage and the guru. It’s “rape” because you’re helpless: you can’t protect or defend yourself. Because of the practices you’ve done and your relationship with your teacher, your egocentric defense mechanisms don’t function in their usual way anymore.

BTW, it is quite well known that Dzogchen does not reject external phenomena. The view of Dzogchen concerning external phenomena is the same as Prasangika Madhyamaka. Phenomena are not mind, but they are also not other than mind, that is to say, they are dependent on mental designations of appearances, but appearances, such as the appearance of a mountain, does not arise from the mind.

I am still working my way through the beginning of the book.  At the beginning, it is explained how Samantabhadra is before all activity in consciousness, effectively once awareness arises and recognizes itself.  Samantabhadra is thus the same in all mindstreams.

Malcolm wrote:
This is also an error of interpretation. Samatabhadra arises out of recognizing the activity of consciousness as "his" own state. In other words, even Samantabhadra possesses ignorance. Samantabhadra is never deluded, but delusion and ignorance are not the same thing. Ignorance can lead to delusion, but it does not necessarily lead to delusion.

LoveFromColorado said:
This line of thought is what got me thinking (as mentioned above) - is consciousness a manifestation of rigpa and what differentiates one consciousness from another given that they are not the same in terms of oneness but are the same in terms of Samantabhadra?

Malcolm wrote:
Rig pa is another name for a pure consciousness that recognizes its own state. If a consciousness does not recognize or mis-knows (ma rig pa) its own state, it then continues into delusion. On the other hand, rig pa and ma rig pa are likened to the front and the back of the hand-- they essentially belong together and are both forms of knowing.

In order to understand this, you need to understand the three-fold ignorance model: ignorance identical with its cause; connate ignorance; and imputing ignorance. These there are discussed in the section on how delusion arises which forms the second of the eleven topics of the Great Perfection. The prayer you are studying uses a two-fold ignorance model -- this presentation is also fine, but I have seen that it can be more easily misunderstood. The tantra this prayer is found in defines things as follows:

In the beginning, since the the unconscious mind overflows from the latent all-basis, the connate ignorance arises. As above, since the deluded vision of sounds, lights and rays arises gradually, the subtle mind that thinks "the external world arises from me," or "I arise from the external world" moves as a mistaken belief.

Here, the all-basis refers to the ālayavijñāna, which is defined as neutral. The "unconscious mind" is the way this tantra defines the first ignorance, the ignorance identical to the cause. Here, this simply means that in the beginning one is unaware of oneself, i.e., unconscious. At the moment the sounds, lights, and rays arise, which are manifestations of one's own state, the connate ignorance arises because now there is a perception which can be mistaken for duality.

Samantabhadra wakes up without entering delusion because in the second moment of the basis arising from the basis, he recognizes these sounds, lights, and rays as being his own state, and his consciousness becomes prajñā, and prajñā is rig pa, or vidyā. The way the Sound Tantra explains this is:

As such, in saṃsāra at the start and nirvāṇa at the end,
since the buddhas did not become deluded,
the sense organs that rose up out of the basis
recognized the self-appearances as natureless;
there was no lapse into mental analysis of external objects;
and [the self-appearances] were ascertained to be their own
movements.

Remember, ignorance does not equal delusion. This is an important point.

When we do not recognize these sounds, lights, and rays as being our own state, as stated above, we engage in dualistic grasping, which is the third ignorance, the imputing ignorance. For this reason, the Powerful Aspiration states:

The connate ignorance
is an amnesiac confused consciousness.
The imputing ignorance
grasps at both self and other. 
The two ignorances, connate and imputing, 
are the basis of the delusion of all sentient beings.
Through the aspiration of the Buddha, myself, 
may all the sentient beings of samsara’s three realms
awaken from the thick darkness of amnesia, 
purify the consciousness of dualistic grasping, 
and recognize their own vidyā.

Thus in Buddhahood it is said:

If it is asked how delusion came about, delusion arose from the difference between the basis and the conscious aspect of the basis.

Remember, the basis is just one's unfabricated mind that is clear and empty. Buddhahood again:

As such, because the basis, one’s unfabricated mind, arose as the essence of the sole reality, there is no need to search elsewhere for the place, etc. Thus, that is called self-originated pristine consciousness.

In reality, one should study these things at the feet of a qualified teacher, because with Dzogchen, it is very easy to make mistakes and adopt wrong views.

As a famous Sakyapa master said, until you gain certainty in the view, the view should not be expressed in words. I understand that you want to understand these things, but talking about them here on Dharmawheel and other places on the internet is likely to just lead you deeper into confusion and an incorrect understanding.

It is one thing to do practices that are taught as part of an established lineage and another thing to practice the terma of a specific teacher that are not part of a lineage collection (tersar). In the first instance any teacher that belongs to the lineage should have the experience to guide you, in the second instance...

It seems the name that has been omitted in the above was Alexander the Great, whose empire it was that straddled Gandhara, and whose language and artistic culture had profound influence in that part of the world. The Questions of Kind Milinda were an account of a dialogue between a Buddhist monk, Ven. Nagasena, and a Greco-Bactrian King. It is said to be one of the very oldest continuously extant written texts in the Buddhist corpus, or indeed world literature.

I have always found the 'Gandhara' style of Buddhist iconography beautiful, such as https://www.google.com.au/search?q=gandhara+buddhist+art&rlz=1C5CHFA_enAU576AU576&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiG6aSp0Y7fAhUJp48KHZ7-Dx4Q_AUIDigB&biw=1190&bih=693.

Some interpretations understand it that way, but in reality it refers to the ālayavijñāna which carries the seeds which produce appearances as the imagined nature.

Well this esoteric violence caused nearly the disappearing of a very old  "Tibetan" culture, which was venerated a very long time by the Tibetan kings, it assured them the ladder to heaven.

Malcolm wrote:
The extent to which Tibetan Kings from Nyatri Tsanpo onward take Zhang Zhung names shows that Tibet was a vassal state of Zhang Zhung between the late second century BCE to the 7 century CE, dominated by a powerful neighbor. But the climate changed in Western Tibet, from the 6th century onwards, because of long term deforestation, overgrazing and so on, causing the upper Tibetan plateau to became nonviable for sustaining intensive agriculture and so on, leading to the decline and eventual collapse of the Zhang Zhung civilization.

It is true that "Bonpos", clans with political allegiances to the old Zhang Zhung kingdom, hostile to Indian influence at the Tibetan court, were expelled from Central Tibet during the late 8th century, in part because of their opposition to the importation of Indian Buddhism. However, the Bonpo accounts of this Imperial period history are distorted, as irrefutable textual scholarship has shown. Ligmincha was not assassinated in the 8th century by Trisong De'utsan, as Bonpo accounts generally hold, but rather by Srongtsan Gampo in the 7th century, as comparative analysis with surviving old Tibetan documents show.

The Bon that existed (if Bon existed at that time at all) at the time of the Imperial period is not the Bon which exists today. So called Yungdrung Bon, the Bon that exists today, is modern system which dates no earlier than the 11th century. Bonpo partisans may persist in their ideas about the origins of Bon, but no modern scholar with any credibility accepts them. Bon largely derives its modern day teaching from Indian Buddhism, drawing upon both Nyingma as well as Sarma sources. In Bon literature, traces survive of pre-Buddhist Tibetan religious practices, but not enough to constitute a systematic tradition.

The truth is that Tibetans had no system of writing prior to Songtsan Gampo's reign. While some scholars, like Chogyal Namkhai Norbu have endeavored to show that Tibetans indeed has a system of writing prior to this period, there is also no evidence that there was writing in Zhang Zhung, and extensive paleographical analysis proves that all Tibetan writing systems, including dmar yig, and so on, descend ultimately from the late Gupta script used in Nepal and North India, adapted to the Tibetan language in Tibet during the 7th century, no earlier than 630 CE. Sam van Schaik has written an excellent article on the subject ( https://www.academia.edu/2039996/A_New_Look_at_the_Tibetan_Invention_of_Writing ), which anyone interested in Tibetan history should read.  He leaves open the possibility that Tibetans might have used writing earlier than this, but there is no documented evidence or contemporary confirmation of such usage. The fact that Tibet had no system of writing, as reported by the Chinese Tang Annals, as well as the Tibetans themselves, should be enough to cast doubts on Bonpo claims for an antiquity competing with or exceeding that of Indian Buddhism.

The truth is that Yungdrung Bon is a modern system, heavily dependent on Indian Buddhism and entirely indebted to it. Of course, being a copy of Indian Buddhism, by and large, we cannot say that the doctrines it espouses are false or wrong, because that would call into question the original: Indian Buddhism. But we can certainly point out that the Bon origin narrative are wholly fabricated, assembled out of vague memories of important pre-Buddhist religious and clan leaders, and cast in myths which provides a source for their religion which is not located in India, but rather the previously culture region that was dominant in Tibet prior to the 7th century, the then predominantly-Buddhist, Iranian-speaking regions of Central Asian, as the origin stories told about Tonpa Shenrab, and several clan histories of Tibetan clans show.

A possible Bon response to this would be to point out that likewise, there is virtually no evidence to support many Buddhist narratives about the Seven Past Buddhas and so on, and I agree, there is no evidence to support the existence of the six buddhas prior to Śākyamuni apart from annals that recorded their names in Vinaya texts, Sūtras, and the like, and list their names. However, these lists all correspond and can be dated to the 1st century BCE. Since we are dealing with religious texts, we are likely to find many myths and legends in them that are unprovable.

I don't state any of the above because I bear some grudge against the Bon tradition. Quite the contrary, I am perhaps one of the few Buddhist scholars who openly admits to enjoying reading and delving to Bonpo literature, because I think it is important for deepening understanding Tibetan culture and literature. On the other hand, it would be dishonest for me to support Bonpo claims to antiquity and so on, simply put, because there is absolutely no evidence for it. In the case of Tonpa Shenrab, there are only a few fragments concerning him in Dunhuang material and the old Tibetan documents, and they do not paint a picture of a nirmanakāya, but rather, a picture of a religious personage engaged in ritual activities along with other Tibetan priests in the pre-Buddhist period.

Finally, with respect to the idea that there are two Padmasambhavas, one good, and one evil, this is a notion also bandied about by some sectarian fools in the Geluk school. It is a silly idea, and a total fabrication.

There is only one Padmasambhava, who came from a region in what is now Pakistan, to assist the king of Tibet in building Samye. In terms of the oldest accounts we have, there is some disagreement about the manner of his birth, how long he stayed, and what he did in Tibet, but there is 100 percent agreement among all that he introduced the system of Vajrakilaya into Tibet, that he tamed the gods and demons of Tibet at Mt. Hepo, that Yeshe Tosgyal was his partner, and when his work was finished, he departed towards the southwest from the plains of Gungthang.

Now, given that you are posting in a Buddhist forum, it ought to be brought to your attention that very few people here have faith in Bon. Bon is tolerated because it is Tibetan and because it is derived from Buddhism, but most Tibetan Buddhists are not interested in Bon, for better or for worse. Your aggressive promotion of Bon has been tolerated for many years now. But when you engage in politics and start making false claims about Padmasambhava, such as claiming there was a Good Bonpo Padmasambhava and a Bad Indian Yogi Padmasambhava, you are no better than Buddhists who reduce all Bonpos to practitioners of animal sacrifice. You are just engaging in blatant sectarianism. Whether or not the tradition of the tigress being Ati Muwer is true or false, the fact is that Padmasambhava was invited to Tibet to subdue native Pre-Buddhist Tibetan, a.k.a., Bonpo gods. His endeavor to do so was regarded as a success by the Tibetan Kings. His form of Buddhism was adopted and whatever native religious traditions that existed in Tibet went rapidly into decline, never to be resurrected. The power of the clans with allegiance to Zhang Zhung, as well as allegiance to China was permanently broken, and from 9th century onward most Tibetans regarded India as the source of their spiritual tradition. The vast majority of members here are Buddhists who also look to India as the source of their tradition, and speaking for the majority, most of us find Bon of barely passing interest, not because it is of no value, but because we are not going to become disciples of Bonpo lamas and take up the various practice cycles one can find there.

Hi again everyone! I have been reflecting on this statement over the past couple of days and I must confess that I'm having a difficult time coming to grips with it.  For example, the ninth virtuous deed is to give up wishing harm for others and instead cultivate compassion. The tenth would be to give up wrong views and establish oneself in the correct view. And so on... avoid killing, renounce stealing, practice compassion, speak truthfully, etc.

How can one not engage in these and expect inner peace, awakening, etc.? For example, if you have resources and come across someone who is in true need and withhold those resources, then how can your mind be calm?

Beyond that, it seems to go against some basic teachings regarding the Bodhisattva path and even the kindness of the guru.

Thanks in advance!

"And the fifth precept with respect to laypeople is really the fourth, actually, since if you do not forgo drinking alcohol, you also do not possess the precept of avoiding sexual misconduct (on the theory that the former will lead to the latter)."

Apropos of this, there's a Lama, maybe Kagyud, (Whose name I cannot dredge up) Who won't give any of the other four precepts if you don't take the fifth for this very reason. Since alcohol diminishes mindfulness and knowing what should and should not be done -- drenpa and sheshin -- it makes any of the preceding four all the more easy to break, not just sex.

IME, the problem with alcohol is that you don't necessarily know you've drunk too much, and when you do, it's already too late.


Malcolm wrote:
Nevertheless, a four vow holder holds the vows of refuge, as well as the the precept of not taking life, not stealing, and not lying. This is how it is classified in the three vows.

But of course, as Mahāyānis, the principle of the precepts is not the physical action, but rather, the intention behind the action -- for this reason, Mahāyāna bhikṣus may handle money, associated with women, and so on, because much of what is prohibited in Śrāvakayāna vows is permitted in Mahāyāna and vice verse. The Trisamvara Chapter of the Ratnakuta goes into this at length, as does Sakya Paṇḍita in his Distinguishing the Three Vows.

Also, having a beer or a glass of wine, or even a whole bottle of wine, does not necessarily imply that one must lose one's mindfulness. It depends on one's capacity.

It seems like an extraordinary contemplative feat, perhaps impossible, if we are to be skeptical instead of inquisitive. I can't imagine it.

Title: Two truths or Three?
Content:


Queequeg said:
Conventional is not false. Its empty.

Malcolm wrote:
It appears you don't understand what "conventional" ( vyavahāra ) means.

Queequeg said:
the pot is a convention. in a given context, it holds up well as a pot, like when I'm boiling my porridge. In other words, the pot is true. Its also empty. And yet, its conventionally there.

Malcolm wrote:
The definition of "conventional" is predicated on a given thing being able to serve a function according to how it is designated. A given pot in which things can be cooked is a valid pot because it functions according to its designation, it is thus a conventional truth.

When a conventional pot is perceived by an ordinary person, this is a superficial truth, because their cognition of the pot is mistaken with respect to its actual nature, emptiness, though their perception is not mistaken with respect to its aspect: a working, functional pot.

When the same conventional pot is perceived by an ārya bodhisattva in meditative equipoise, their perception of the conventional pot is unmistaken, an ultimate truth, because such a bodhisattva is perceiving the pot in terms of its actual nature, emptiness. When such a bodhisattva leaves meditative equipoise, their perception of the conventional pot is again mistaken with respect to its essence. The key difference however between the ārya bodhisattva and an ordinary person like you or I, is that the ārya bodhisattva now has a direct, nonconceptual experience of ultimate truth, which in post-equipoise irrevocably undermines their clinging to phenomena as real.

These two perceptions are mutually exclusive and cannot be cognized at one and the same time by anyone, anywhere, just as no one can simultaneously see the same entity as wholly black and wholly white at one and the same time.

Queequeg said:
Suffering comes from naively thinking the pot is essentially real. That's ignorance of emptiness. That's not what we're talking about.

Malcolm wrote:
Suffering comes about from the afflictive obscuration that causes us to continue to have attachment to entities even though we, as ordinary Buddhists, know intellectually that dependent origination is empty, dependently designated, and the middle way. This is precisely what I am talking about, and have been talking about all along.  We have this suffering because, as we have to admit, we do not truly know the distinction between the two truths.

Asserting that true and false cognitions are ontologically identical, conventionally speaking, is a false statement. The explanation you summoned from the internet in an attempt to explain your third truth makes this claim, and it is facially incoherent. So either you believe that true and false cognitions are ontologically identical or you don't.

Queequeg said:
Your asserting something beyond the two truths - "The two truths are inseparable"... Some might call that a third truth.

Malcolm wrote:
Observing that the two truths are inseparable is merely stating that a given entity, such as a pot, can be the object of a veridical cognition (ultimate truth) or the object of a false cognition (superficial truth). It does not mean this is a third truth.

Understanding the distinction between the two truths is vitally important for liberation.

Malcolm wrote:
There is no such thing a canonically irrelevant source, unless one is trying to refute a higher position with the textual sources of a lower one: for example, attempting to refute Madhyamaka positions with Yogacāra texts. Are you asserting that Zhiyi has a higher position than the Buddha or Nāgārjuna? If so, you need to demonstrate that. If Zhiyi does not have a higher position than the Buddha or Nāgārjuna, then Mahāyāna Sūtra citations dealing with the two truths and Madhyamaka commentators on Nāgārjuna must be admissible sources. It then only remains to be shown whether his positions are consistent with Mahāyāna Sūtra sources on the two truths and Madhyamaka in general.

Thanks Malcolm. My information here was received from a teaching by Anam Thubten a couple of weeks ago in which he made mention that one can experience enlightenment in any given moment. Do you have a source that states otherwise? I ask this purely out of interest, not contention.

Malcolm wrote:
One can experience awakening in any given moment, and when you do, you are a first stage bodhisattva. But the idea that you can experience awakening and then return the state of an ordinary, unawakened being is very mistaken-- it represents a complete confusion of the paths and stages. Once one has experienced awakening, one joins the rank of the āryas. On the other hand, it is possible to experience a similitude of awakening below what is called "the path of seeing." This similitude of awakening, however, is still conceptual.

From my limited understanding, the basic hallmark of "progress" on a spiritual path is avoiding the ten unwholesome actions and embracing the ten virtuous actions.  Even more broadly speaking, if you see compassion and wisdom increasing in your life, then you can have some degree of confidence that you are making "progress" on the path.

In Dzogchen there is no need to engage in virtuous deeds —— but the sign of practice is that one has less inclination to engage in nonvirtuous deeds.

So pointing out the hypocrisy of the comments here about what the letter calls a "blatant double standard" is irrelevant? I am discussing the content of DJKRs letter. What are you talking about? And how is Myanmar not simply following the US example. US went to war on the Muslim world in 2001 and is still bombing daily. Rohingya expulsion began over a decade after. If you are murdering people every day maybe censuring others is a bit much. Take back Obama's Peace Prize or just live with being a hypocrite.

Malcolm wrote:
You are making a lot of personal assumptions here, which are unwarranted. 1) When did I ever defend Obama's Nobel Peace Prize? 2) When did I ever advocate killing Muslims as a sound and acceptable US Policy? I voted against Obama because of his policies in in 2012 [but not for Romney]. Finally, the Nobel Peace Prize is not mine to bestow or retract. You are just being deliberately antagonistic.

Ok, having dispensed with your ad hominem remarks, the regime in Myanmar is not basing themselves on any US policy, perceived or otherwise. They are simply engaged in ethnic cleansing of a minority, a minority which enthusiastically backed Aung San Su Khyi's government, a minority they have sought to expunge for decades. The Myanmar Gvt. and its predecessors have been systematically depriving the Rohingya rights as a community since 1962.

Finally, the idea that as an American, I ought to be quiet because my Gvt. is engaged in actions of which I do not approve is just absurd. You are Canadian, and your Gvt., as well as the British Gvt. was right in there in with American troops, "murdering Muslims" after 9/11 as well: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada_in_the_War_in_Afghanistan. Yes, it is true that Canada sensibly avoided both Bush wars in Iraq, but your country did not avoid the Afghanistan war.

With respect to Dzongsar Khyentse's letter, as I said before, he is entitled to his own opinions but he is not entitled to his own facts, just as you are not entitled to your own facts.

These are the facts:
Fact: The Rohingya have been getting a raw deal for more than half a century, since the military coup that happened in 1962.
Fact: The Rohingya have been a persecuted, stateless people under Myanmar Law since 1962.
Fact: Aung San Su Khyi's government was won in part because of popular support of the Rohingya population.
Fact: Aung San Su Khyi has turned a blind eye to the suffering of a significant ethnic group for whom she is responsible as the de facto head of the state.
Fact: Dzongsar Khyentse's piece contains factual errors, whether or not one agrees with his opinions about the lowliness of Western Civilization or the glory of Asian Civilization.
Fact: Last time I checked, you were a product of Western Civilization. Must be interesting to be a self-hating westerner.

Just remember, the greatest Buddhist king in history, Aśoka, after his conversion to Buddhism murdered an entire community of 18,000 Jains for a slight toward the Buddha by one of them, and subsequently offered to pay a bounty of one dinara for the head of any Jain brought to him. By mistake Aśoka's brother, Vitaśoka, a Buddhist monk, was mistaken for a Jain, killed, and his head was turned in for the bounty. Only after this, only after misfortune was brought upon his own family because of his murderous policy, did Aśoka eliminate capital punishment. So much for the glory of Buddhist civilization.

The precept says nothing about "alcohol is  a poison", or "alcohol is inherently bad so don't have anything to do with it". There are other teachings that certainly  might say things like this, and we should adhere to the teachings which are definitive for us. If one is simply following the fifth precept though, then one just avoids intoxication which causes heedlessness, not much more to it than that from my point of view.

As far as Right Livelihood, IMO there is a certainly a substantial difference between someone who sells alcohol exclusively for a living, and someone who serves it as an incidental part of their job (waiter at a restaurant serving beer and wine, as one example). Also as I mentioned, if one does something like work at a bar, one will likely be put into situations which certainly would test one's Right livelihood - deciding to serve alcoholic regular customers for example.

Just working at a restaurant though? Objecting to that is just overzealous moralizing, from my point of view, not application of Buddhist ethics.

Hence my comment about virtual particles. 

A photon, for instance, is not a particle. It has no mass. But it is referred to as a particle for the sake of convenience of language when referred to it and dealing with it in general. 

It seems it's just something mysterious, then? 

[...]

Or perhaps it would be better to say that the Theravāda traditionally teach that there is or there would be "no time" so-to-speak, in an antarābhava, and as such it can't exist (I don't know if they would formally argue this, I am just drawing this as a possible conclusion leading why there can't be, and 'isn't an antarābhava'), but there is nonetheless a convenience of language to refer to the participation of the to-be-born, despite this not really being something that even "exists" in the same way that the beings mating do, assuming that that is indeed the case.

Of course, in order to actually engage in practice and gain accomplishment, you need empowerment. And for that you need a qualified Guru. The vajrayana simply doesn't work without empowerment and guidance from a qualified Guru.

It should be kept in mind that Zhiyi was responding to his contemporaries. The dumbed down version of two truths are attributed to what he called Provisional Mahayana. The three Truths you are describing may apply to the Separate Teaching. This is where the Middle is a sublime state beyond the binary two truths. In the perfect, the distinctions are effaced. It then transitions into a consideration of the means by which enlightened beings transform others.

Malcolm wrote:
You keep mistaking the two truths for principles, rather than what they are, that is, cognitions.

The terms "emptiness," "dependent designation," and "middle way" are synonyms. They refer to the same thing. In other words, there is no sublime middle that can be peeled away from the two truths. The two truths are inseparable, this is why Dharmamitra, in his commentary on Haribhadra's Sphutartha commentary on the Perfection of Wisdom states:

Called "deep," because some people do not understand the inseparable two truths, and for them it becomes a place of fear, its depth difficult to realize."

It is possible we are talking about the same thing, but thus far, I don't think so. Jayānanda states in his commentary on Candra's Introduction to the Middle Way:

The middle way is understood as dependent origination, having abandoned grasping to permanence and annihilation.

And:

The middle way is the path free from concepts of entities and nonentities.

Nāgārjuna again, in the Vigrahavyavartani:

I pay homage the supreme peerless Buddha who taught
emptiness, dependent origination, and the middle way to have one meaning.

Or Buddhapalita:

"Having a view of existence or nonexistence with respect to entities results in many errors, therefore, "entities lack inherent existence" is seeing the truth, i.e., the middle way, and that is proof of the ultimate.

Bhavaviveka states:

Whatever is emptiness, that is designated in dependence. Because the convention of mundane and transcendent is asserted, there is designation dependent on appropriation. That is the middle way, because the middle is free from the extremes arising and nonarising, existence and nonexistence...For the meditation of the middle way it is said that one does not conceive at all, "The eye is an existent entity," "The eye is not an existence entity," and so on. The Ārya Ratnakuta Sūtra states, "Kāśyapa, "Existence" is one extreme; 'Nonexistence" is the second extreme, whatever is between those extremes is without form and cannot be shown, is unimpeded, nonabiding, does not appear, is not perceptible, is not a place." Those are the proofs. "Path" is a convention for "method of obtaining."

If I can summarize the above, I think the reason, or a reason, why it can be difficult for someone coming from a thorough background in normative Madhyamaka to engage significantly with the three truths inasmuch as they are laid out in a gradual-and-successive framework (i.e. 1, 2, 3, the way we always see them "laid out" so to speak) may well be because the perspective is so coarse and basic. At the stage of the first contemplation, basic things like the "emptiness of emptiness" have not been established and are not established until the second contemplation. These are things that we take for granted in our daily discussion of the two truths. Ven Zhiyi, it seems, does not take emptiness of emptiness for granted, and wants to exhaustively and slowly introduce increasing levels of complexity to a practice that starts extraordinarily coarse and basic, so much so as to only vaguely be called Buddhism, and becomes progressively more refined, until the end-result perfect-and-sudden interfusion of contemplations is equivalent to normative Madhyamaka, not above it.

not heard by you from another, but seen for yourself.
Those [two] are the relative and ultimate.
There isn't any third truth at all

The citation you provide merely means that  emptiness, dependent designation, and middle way are synonyms.  Candrakīrti states in the Prasannapāda:

Queequeg said:
Whatever is emptiness, that is a dependently designated"  is the presentation of "that emptiness itself is dependent designation." A chariot is designated in dependence on the parts of a chariot such as the wheels and so forth. Whatever is designated in dependence on its own parts, that by nature is nonarising. Whatever by nature is nonarising, that is emptiness. That emptiness bearing the characteristic of being nonarising by nature is the presentation of the middle way, that is, because in something that does not arise by nature there is no existence, and because there is no perishing in something which does not arise by nature, there is no nonexistence. Because of being free from the two extremes of existence and nonexistence, that emptiness bearing the characteristic of nonarising by nature itself is the middle way or the middle path. That being the case, therefore, "emptiness," "dependent designation," and "middle way" are different names for dependent origination.

Malcolm wrote:
This is all to counter the realism concerning dependent origination found in the lower schools, i.e., that there are dependently originated things, continuities, and so on.

Conventionally, we can assert the observation that all dharmas arise together. It doesn't negate the observation that this dependence is what it means to be empty.

There is no nature of arising other than that. 
Whatever arises in dependence on conditions is explained to be empty.
The one who knows emptiness, that one is prudent.

Sung-Bae Park Buddhism and Sudden Enlightenment p. 110 Chapter Fourteen
Faith and Enlightenment in the Hua-yen Sutra
Hua-yen Buddhism is based on the idea of dharmadhatu* (Chinese: fa chieh), or the "dharma realm." In the dharma realm, there is li shih wu-ai, or "unobstructed mutual penetration between phenomena and noumena," and shih shih wu-ai, or "unobstructed mutual penetration between phenomena and phenomena." The formula Li shih wu-ai means that each dharma contains the totality, whereas shih shih wu-ai means that all dharmas mutually contain each other. All dharmas interpenetrate because they arise through pratityasamutpada*>, or "dependent origination." Since each dharma arises through pratityasamutpada*, it has no svabhava*, or "self-nature,'' and therefore mixes through and through with every other dharma. As a result of pratityasamutpada* in the dharma realm of mutual penetration, "all is in one" and "one is in all." Even though all dharmas penetrate each other mutually without obstruction, they still function separately and remain exactly as they are.
The Hua-yen dharma realm is often illustrated by the "jewel net of Indra." Here, the universe is likened to a net wherein each intersection has a jewel that reflects the totality (establishing li shih wu-ai) as well as all the other jewels (establishing shih shih wu-ai) from its own viewpoint in the net. There is thus a mutual reflection among all dharmas in the universe, so that one mirrors all and all mirror one.2

These things all make great poetry, but they don't stand up to analysis. Further, defining dharma as phenomena and dharmatā as noumena is a terrible idea. Noumena is a term we have from Kant, and means "a thing as it is in itself, as distinct from a thing as it is knowable by the senses through phenomenal attributes." There is no such a thing as a thing in itself (svabhāva). Saying "thing in itself" is just a reference to a self-nature. So it really does not work when applied to any Buddhist philosophy.

If a common bodhisattva has a more limited range than an āryabodhisattva, it stands to reason they cannot immediately benefit as many sentient beings, right?

On the other hand, a first stage bodhisattva has a limited range compared with a tenth stage bodhisattva as well.

TrimePema said:
I understand what you are saying, Lopon. I am asking about the specific mechanics by which one can prove that a non-arya bodhisattva is already engaged in the same caliber of benefit to any given sentient being as an arya bodhisattva is but with less range. Here speaking of let's say only one subject of benefit.

I am asking this question regarding what I said earlier - that in order to benefit sentient beings as a bodhisattva one must really first attain at least the first bhumi (but now I think, after having read all of your responses, that I was mistaken and I really should have said the 8th bhumi).

Malcolm wrote:
Well, if there is no ārya bodhisattva around, but there is someone who wants to hear the dharma, and there is a regular guy named joe who has some understanding of Mahāyāna, and give an explanation, who is benefitting that being more? An absent ārya bodhisattva or a present common bodhisattva name joe?

And what is meant here by benefit? The only truly beneficial things Buddhas and bodhisattvas do is demonstrate the path. Of the three kinds of giving, the gift of Dharma is the most meaningful. Of course, giving material gifts to the needy and protection to the fearful is beneficial, but the most profound generosity is the gift of Dharma.

One might not be an ārya bodhisattva, but if one can bestow the gift of Dharma, the benefit of this gift is truly inconceivable, and it really does not matter whether you are an awakened bodhisattva or not. You never know if the person to whom you bestow the gift of Dharma won't manifest high level of realization.

The aspiration to attain full buddhahood itself is of inconceivable benefit from the point of view of the cause. It is the cause of all benefit in samsara. Therefore, even the aspiration of a common person to full buddhahood is inconceivably beneficial to all sentient beings, far more profound than the awakening of an arhat or pratyekabuddha.

The idea that one can only benefit sentient beings as a first or an 8th stage bodhisattva is therefore erroneous.

Shantideva says in The Way of the Bodhisattva 1:9:

Should bodhicitta come to birth
In those who suffer, chained in the prison of samsara, 
in that instant they are called Children of the Blissful One,
revered by all the world, the gods, and humankind...

Shantideva also mentions that of course the bodhicitta of aspiration itself is not sufficient, one needs to have engaged bodhicitta as well. And here, in 1:17-19, he says:

From bodhicitta in intention,
Great results arise for those still turning in the wheel of life;
But merit does not arise from it in ceaseless streams
As is the case for active bodhicitta. 

For when, with irreversible intent
the mind embraces bodhicitta,
Willing to set free the endless multitude of beings,
In that instant, from that moment on,

A great and unremitting stream,
A strength of wholesome merit, 
even during sleep and inattention,
Rises equal to the vastness of the sky.

Also, the "one is all, all is one idea" is negated throughly by an analysis of the self of the person; if there is no self in a person composed of five aggregates, under the stated principle of the article, one can't except to find a "one" composed of "all" or an "all" that composes "one" either.

Malcolm wrote:
The inference you have made, based on the definition as you understand it, is incorrect. The dharmadhātu is uncompounded. Since your definition is incorrect, your argument is flawed.

The basic statement you first made was, "a given particular compounded dharma is the dharmadhātu (an uncompounded dharma)." This is incoherent.

You then changed your tune to "because a given particular compounded dharma exists, all compounded dharmas exist." This is just the Sarvastivādin generative cause, kāraṇahetu, that is, all phenomena are generative causes of all other phenomena with the exception of themselves. This is classical Abhidharma.  See page 254, Abdhidharmakośabhaṣyaṃ, Pruden. But this is not even at the level of dependent origination yet. The six causes and the four conditions are explained prior to dependent origination; which only has to do with afflictive causes that generate samsaric existence, not causes and conditions in general. The gatha you quoted by the Buddha was actually spoken by him in response to the question of who this or that monk had been in a past life. His intention, in that statement, was to point out from affliction and action arise suffering, and with the absence of affliction and action, suffering ceases.

Also, your error in the latter statement is equating all dharmas with the dharmadhātu.

As I said above, the dharmadhātu is uncompounded. For example, Vasubandhu explains in his commentary on the Mahāyānasūtra-alaṃkāra, "The dharmadhātu is uncompounded because it does not arise and it does not perish." Maitreyanātha explains in the Distinguishing the the Middle from Extremes, "When emptiness is summarized, it is called suchness, absence of characteristics, the limit of the real (bhūtakoṭi), and the dharmadhātu."

Without compassion, one cannot generate bodhicitta, and without bodhicitta, one cannot attain perfect buddhahood. So one can understand that compassion is the field in which the qualities of awakening grow.

Range.

TrimePema said:
Forgive my obtuseness.

Are you saying a non-arya being benefits countless beings in inconceivable ways just by having taken the bodhisattva vow and subsequently engaging in common activities like giving money to homeless people and meditating 20 minutes a day? In other words, that a non-arya bodhisattva benefits only some beings and arya bodhisattvas benefit increasingly large numbers according to the bhumis, but the benefit is the same caliber?

Are you saying that a non-arya bodhisattva will automatically benefit beings in inconceivable ways in each and every lifetime simply by having the vow on their mindstream, even if they have not revived the vow in their current lifetime?

Malcolm wrote:
The range of the activity of common bodhisattvas is limited. They have not developed four basis of miraculous power, the five higher knowledges, and so forth.

Ārya bodhisattvas have more range, since, from the first bhumi onward a bodhisattva has emanations that increase by the power of ten. This, first stage bodhisattvas have 100 emanations and so forth. Also, due to their realization of emptiness, bodhisattvas on the stages are not mired down by the connate fetter of grasping a self, and thus can engage in tremendous deeds.

Nevertheless, the simple aspiration to attain full awakening has sufficient force to make certain that person will someday attain full awakening.

With respect to the bodhisattva vow, this is, in actuality, only ever taken once. Each subsequent time one goes to receive the bodhisattva vow in another lifetime, it is signal that one has in fact received in in a previous lifetime. The bodhisattva vow is taken upon the mindstream because it is principally a vow taken as a motivation, unlike pratimokṣa and secret mantra vows, which are principally taken upon the body of this life as precepts for conduct. Thus, at death, one does not lose the bodhisattva vow, unlike pratimokṣa vows and secret mantra vows, which are lost at the breakup of the five aggregates at the time of death.

There are a number of ways around this:

1. Due to Tathagatagarbha none of us is an ordinary being, it is just that our true qualities are obscured by ignorance.

2. Human beings arise due to certain causes and conditions, these are eradicated by enlightenment. Once (partially or fully) enlightened you are no longer a (samsaric) human being, you are a Buddha, or Arhat, or Bodhisattva.

3. Even if the Buddha was already enlightened in Tusita and merely manifested in human form to teach us, this still does not nullify his journey towards enlightenment as outlined in (for example) the Jataka.

YOU cannot "come back for innumerable lifetimes under inconceivably variable circumstances according to the particulars of one's aspirations and vows" UNLESS you have achieved the first bhumi, since without achieving the first bhumi, one will be flung back and forth up and down the 6 realms uncontrollably.

Until that happens, your lifetimes are not ACTUAL bodhisattva lifetimes; your activity is not ACTUALLY liberating or helping per se anybody in any meaningful way.

When the first bhumi is attained, one will be able to lead beings to a meaningful stage of the path. Therefore, there is only the aspiration to become a bodhisattva and engage in such activity, until one actually becomes a bodhisattva.

Malcolm wrote:
No, from the moment one generates the aspiration to full buddhahood one bears the name "jinapūtra" and IS a bodhisattva, training in the pāramitā and observing bodhisattva vows.

TrimePema said:
In Vajrayana, one's life is centered around the realization of the nature of mind, which is what allows one to engage in paramita activity 24/7 through what is known as self-liberation, which is only possible through keeping the commitments (abstaining from certain things and committing to do certain other things) which allow that nature of mind to become manifest.

Malcolm wrote:
All Buddhist teachings are centered around realizing the nature of the mind. Self-liberation has nothing whatsoever to do with maintaining samaya.

The principle difference between common Mahāyāna and uncommon Mahayāna Secret Mantras is skillful means, otherwise, otherwise the goal is the same, the bodhicitta is the same, and so forth.

Anders said:
A bit of a basic question but: How does deity yoga differ from a practitioner with siddhis to communicate directly with a mahasattva or Buddha?

Malcolm wrote:
Deity yoga is a path. If someone has siddhis already, why would they need Vajrayāna?

Anders said:
Also: Visualization of oneself as a deity at a glance strikes me as a rather coarse practise compared to, say, the formless practice of prajnaparamita. What is the basis in vajrayana for this being a more productive practise than common kṛtsna shamatha?

Malcolm wrote:
Unless someone has realized the first bhumi, this person can do the actual practice of prajñapāramitā.

Further, there is no method in Pāramitāyāna of experientially introducing the nature of the mind. This exists only in Vajrayāna. It is upon this basis that deity yoga proceeds.

Vajrayāna yoga creates a direct dependent origination with the result (the two kāyas), which is why they are swift; whereas Pāramitā yogas are only connected with the cause (the two accumulations), which is why they take such a long time.

Anders said:
In order to foster nonconceptual samadhi, there are any number of methods connected with body and its channels, winds, and drops to generate this. In common Mahāyāna, one's physical body literally limits the kind of samadhi one can have; hence as one progresses on the path, one takes rebirth in ever more refined bodies. In Vajrayāna, one can access these kinds of samadhi in this lifetime with special methods.
So basically supercharged breath meditation of a sort? Is this connected then to the aforementioned visualisation of oneself as deity? What makes it uncommon?

Malcolm wrote:
Not exactly. But if you really are interested, you should go find a master to receive empowerment, and then study with them in a systematic fashion.

Anders said:
Vajrayāna is a path of nonrenunciation, that is, rather than avoid sense objects, they are transformed and taken into the path. As Naropa said, "The problem is not sense objects, the problem is clinging." In Vajrayāna one is taught certain methods to transform eating, drinking, sex, bathing, wearing clothes, and so on, into the path of awakening. Vajrayāna yoga is a 24/7/365 kind of thing. This is why it is so much more powerful, and dangerous, than common Mahāyāna.
I don't think there is any Buddhist path that is not ultimately intended to be 24/7. Is this meant in a difference sense than the common one then?

Practise without renunciation in the midst of sensory objects or even the kleshas is not hard to find in common Mahayana either, but there it is most commonly connected with already having had some measure of realisation of emptiness. What is the basis in vajrayana for this being appropriate even for noobs? And how does this not end being a significant risk of up burning your karmic fingernails off?

Malcolm wrote:
With respect to 24/7/365 practice of yoga, in Mahāyāna there are no actual methods for integrating all of one's activities into the path. Washing is not a practice. Eating food is not a practice. Taking desire into the path is not a practice. Taking sleep into the path is not a practice. Taking waking into the path is not a practice, and so on. There is no practice connected with developing divine pride. There are no practices connected with utilizing sense objects for one's own benefit, There are no practices which use the body as a basis. There are no practices for taking birth, life, and death onto the path. Mahāyāna lacks the manifold methods found in Vajrayāna.

With respect to using sense objects in the path, in common Mahāyāna one is not permitted to use sense objects in the path unless one is trying to benefit others. So examples of bodhisattvas sporting with 60,000 maidens and so forth are in the context of benefitting others. By contrast, in Vajrayāna, one is permitted from the beginning to use sense objects in the path for ones own purposes. This is a fundamental difference. With respect to kleshas, different kinds of practices are suited for people with different mixes of affliction. In general, the dominant affliction of this age however is hatred, and so the majority of practices are related the Vajra family.

The basis for it being appropriate for beginners to enter Vajrayāna is personal karma. People who are fortunate in this degenerate era will easily enter Vajrayāna teachings and make rapid progress, attaining full buddhahood either in this life or the bardo, or at worst, with three, seven, or sixteen lifetimes. In common Mahāyāna there are no practitioners who attain full buddhahood in less than three asaṃkhyakalpas, despite specious claims to the contrary in various schools, principally Sino-Japanese Mahāyāna, which directly contradict the Buddha's teachings on the subject in sȗtra.

With respect to burning one's fingers, as the Hevajra Tantra states "That which binds fools frees the wise."

This is incoherent.

Moreover, your reasoning that dependent origination covers your identity proposition is also incorrect. Dependent origination only covers conditioned phenomena. Any given dependently produced dharma is compounded. The dharmadhātu is uncompounded. It is completely incoherent to claim that any compounded entity is identical with an uncompounded entity. There is no analysis that one can conduct to demonstrate this point. It would be like saying that upon analysis, earth is space.

"Three thousand worlds in one moment of mind" is just a conventional formulation: it is incapable of withstanding analysis. Not even buddhahood can withstand analysis. So how could "three thousand worlds in one moment of mind" withstand ultimate analysis?

What is even slightly profound about talking about how one relative entity (buddhahood), which cannot withstand ultimate analysis, interpenetrates another relative entity (hell), which also cannot withstand ultimate analysis? All of these things, buddhas, bodhisattvas, hells, the triple realm, etc., are relative truths. None of them withstand ultimate analysis. In other words, if any part of the whole cannot withstand ultimate analysis, the whole itself cannot withstand ultimate analysis.

What needs to be taken into account in the Tiantai context particularly is that any particular dharma is understood to be the dharmadhatu, organized, so to speak around the particular.

As such, it is the dharmadhatu encountering a sense object, which is by the same analysis the totality of the dharmadhatu.

The question here is not the general Mahāyāna understanding.

The point you alluded to is covered explicitly on pp. 762-767 in vol. 2 of CSQI.

As Aryadeva points out, by realizing the emptiness of one thing (dharmatā), one realizes the emptiness of all things (dharmdhātu). So I don't think this point is unique to Chih-I. But it is not controversial point, it's middle-period, standard Mahāyāna— empty sense consciousnesses arise from the meeting of empty sense organs with empty sense objects. Everything arises from emptiness, and everything disappears into emptiness. And even emptiness itself is not established as anything real. It is all illusory all the way down.

Just me, but I would probably stick with something simple like "the realm of experience" (or what Malcolm suggested) rather than fabricating the concept of The Absolute. I mean Buddhism has ultimate truth in the 2 truths doctrine (which is sometimes referred to as "absolute truth"), but "The Absolute" reads a lot more like "the One" of Neoplatonism or "the Tao" of Taoism than what's found in Buddhism.

What needs to be taken into account in the Tiantai context particularly is that any particular dharma is understood to be the dharmadhatu, organized, so to speak around the particular.

As such, it is the dharmadhatu encountering a sense object, which is by the same analysis the totality of the dharmadhatu.

In usage given in the citation, the term seems to be more consistent with the eighteen dhatus of Abhidharma, taken as a trio: the six dhātus of sense organs; the six dhātus of sense consciousnesses; and the six dhātus of sense objects. In other words, the sense organ element; the sense object element; and sense consciousness element for a given sense perception. The usage you note from Swanson has nothing at all do with the dharmadhātu as defined in Mahāyāna as a generic term for emptiness. It has to do with describing the process of cognition. You do not find the term dharmadhātu used in Mahāyāna texts in this way unless it is explicitly denoted as part of the eighteen dhātus. Calling any three of these dhātus "the absolute" is just wrong. It shows that BZ has no understanding of basic Buddhism. The usage of "dharma" here seems generic, in the sense that the eighteen dhatus are all dharmas, and the use of the term dharmadhātu here is generic because the sense organ, object, and consciousness are not being determined.

2) The references made Ziporyn's view of TienTai and one of the early pages of Stone's book on "original enlightenment" are basically irrelevant when coming to grips with those sutras.  There's not much use in getting this far out in the weeds here:  sutras => philosophical systems => contemporary academic discussion on those philosophical systems.

Prove me wrong.
Related:

Suppose you are a lay practitioner, and your objective is to understand the Lotus Sutra.

Are you well served by reading the sutra in a high-quality translation, including the footnotes and introduction?

Would your time be better spent if, instead of reading the sutra, you dove headlong into TienTai philosophy?

Would your time be even better spent if, instead of diving headlong into TienTai philosophy before reading the sutra in a high-quality translation, you fart around with the academic casseroles of J. Stone and B. Ziporyn for a while?

I think the answers are yes, no, and oh hell no.

If your objective is to understand TienTai philosophy, then read that.

If your objective is to understand Jacqueline Stone, then read Jacqueline Stone.  But don't expect others to accept the premise that reading the first sixty pages or so of Stone's book on Original Enlightenment is the same as reading the sutra or the TienTai treatises.

Well, I think, as in all text critical speculation, the only thing you can rightly claim is the following:

1) Sanskrit editions edited by Conze were marred with his own misunderstanding.

2) We have no Indian commentary in our possession that is earlier than 750, nor is there any mention of the text prior to 750 in the Indian sources that we have.

3) By the beginning of the 8th century, the text was considered valid by Indian Panditas.

4) Wonchuk claims to have seen an earlier, flawed Chinese translation, no longer extant, based on his possession or access to a no-longer exant Sanskrit manuscript.

5) Tradition claims that Xuantsang received the text in China and chanted it on is way to India (this is the real basis for Nattier's skepticism of the text.)

6) There are some grammatical oddities in the text which you and others suspect point to a Chinese origin.

7) From a text critical perspective, this is late Indian text. If I were to venture a guess, I would disagree the Chinese origin theory and point out that it is a Vajrayāna period text that originated within a Vajrayāna milieu. Vajrayāna tantras are filled with bad Sanskrit.


Jayarava said:
At a minimum there are currently no trustworthy English translations of the Heart Sutra in existence. Translations from Chinese are slightly more reliable, but are still problematic (because of Matthew's work). The whole enterprise of commentary on the text is called into question and this goes right back to Kuījī and Woncheuk (something Lusthaus fails to notice).

Malcolm wrote:
Of course there are. The ones from Tibetan are just fine.

Jayarava said:
The good news is that when you correct all the mistakes the text makes a great deal more sense and provides a fascinating way into a style of practice that was once very important though it has long since disappeared, i.e. anupalambghayoga, "the yoga of nonapprehension".

Malcolm wrote:
Not so, this kind of yoga still exists in Tibetan Buddhism. As you can see, it is mentioned in the commentarial passage I provided above.

Jayarava said:
A complex of grammatical simple but vitally important errors have been present in the Sanskrit Heart Sutra since Conze edited it 1948. Note that these are errors introduced by Conze. He revised his text in 1967 and did not notice that it did not make sense. In between 1948 and 2015 some of the greatest scholars of Sanskrit and/or Mahāyana Buddhism examined, studied, and importantly translated the text without noticing that it did not make sense (including Jan Nattier!). It would not surprise me in the least if people continued to pretend to translate Conze's text without noticing or fixing the error.

You can only translate things like that within the context of the text, referring also to the contemporary commentaries and the common usage of the terms at the time. Which perhaps brings us back to the question of why/how to study ancient texts: slowly, from multiple angles, and with an understanding of the technical terms used and the choices made in interpreting them. Otherwise you risk thinking something expresses 'truth' because it sounds nice, when in fact all it expresses is confusion.

Here is a scholarly article on Tiantai for the online Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy by Brook Ziporyn, Professor of Chinese Religion at University of Chicago Divinity School,
Traditional Buddhism gives a rather commonsensical account of sentient experience: every moment of sentient experience is a sensory apparatus encountering an object, giving rise thereby to a particular moment of contentful awareness. But in the Tiantai view, each of these three—sense organ, object, this moment of consciousness—is itself the Absolute, the entirety of reality, expressed without remainder in the peculiar temporary form of sense organ, of object, of this consciousness. Hence each moment of every being’s experience is redescribed, to paraphrase a canonical early Tiantai work, as follows:

The absolute totality encounters the absolute totality, and the result is the arising of the absolute totality. (法界對法界起法界)

The Absolute, the whole of reality, is one and eternal, always the same and omnipresent, but it is also the kind of whole that divides from itself, encounters itself, arises anew each moment, engenders itself as the transient flux of each unique and individual moment of experience of every sentient being.

How this view is established, and what its consequences are, is what is to be explained in this article.

The MMK 24:17-19 could not be more clear:

that are not dependently originated,
Therefore, there are no phenomena
that are not empty. 

If all of this is not empty,
there could not no arising and perishing, 
and consequently, for you 
the four noble truths would not exist.

This whole discussion of what is the middle way comes directly after the discussion of how the Buddha only teaches two truths. The two truths are themselves the middle way, the latter is not a third truth. The whole purpose of this discussion in MMK 24 is to explain how the four noble truths are possible only if dependently originated phenomena are understood to be emptiness.

Perhaps there is a tendency to confuse the two truths of Madhyamaka and the threefold contemplation of the dharmadhātu in Tiāntāi.

The threefold contemplation seems to be intended to realize this, in practice:

涅槃與世間　　　　　　　　　　　　無有少分別 
[between] nirvāna and this world 　　[there is] not [even] a slight disparity

世間與涅槃　　　　　　　　　　　　亦無少分別
this world and nirvāṇa 　　also no[t even a] slight disparity

涅槃之實際　　　　　　　　　　　　及與世間際 
[from] nirvāṇa's true apex 　　towards this world's apex

如是二際者　　　　　　　　　　　　無毫釐差別
like this there are two apices 　　[like this there is] not the smallest sliver of disparity
(Madhyamakaśāstra T1564.35c27)

The "third" truth is just this relation between the two truths. It was already in the Kārikā.

Malcolm wrote:
The MMK 24:8-9 is pretty clear:

The doctrine taught by the Buddha
is correctly predicated upon two truths:
the relative truth of the world, 
and the truth of the sublime meaning.

Thos who do not know the difference
between those two truths,
do not know the the profound reality
of the doctrine of the Buddha.

Samsara and nirvana are both relative truths, and that is why there is not even a subtle distinction that can be made between them.

The doctrine of the two truths is supported on the basis of the Meeting of the Father and Son Sūtra, the locus classicus for restricting the number of truths the Buddha taught in Mahāyāna to the two truths. The Buddha himself never taught a third truth. There was never any need. Why? Because as the sūtra mentioned above states, the doctrine of the two truths arose out of the Buddha's direct perception and personal experience.

I understand the idea of the Yogācāra container universe model, however, this model works from the perspective of a deluded mind. So how does this buddha view sentient beings? Are sentient beings similar to the retinue in that they are his own emanations? I know the general phrases, “buddhas don’t see sentient beings” and “sentient beings do not exist.” That is not what I am getting at. I am trying to understand this from a Man ngag sde perspective.

This could mean many things. One thing is Khorwa Tongtrug as a specific form of red Avalokiteshvara, another thing is Khorwa Tongtrug as a term used in inner tantras. There is no practice of Khorwa Tongtrug in Nyingma Kama (Kama gyepa collection) - at least not in the one put together by Dudjom Rinpoche.

Kama transmissions just means oral lineage, so it could very well be just "regular" white four armed Avalokiteshvara as found in Karma Chagme's collected works - which contains one such sadhana called  Recitation and meditation of Avalokiteshvara - Shaking the samsara from the depths, (Tibetan title is: thugs rje chen po'i sgom bzlas 'khor ba dong sprugs). Patrul Rinpoche was dedicated practitioner of Avalokiteshvara and wrote a famous text called Advice virtuous at the beginning, in the middle and at the end (thog mtha' bar gsum du dge ba'i gtam) which has very similar content to Karma Chagme's Union of Dzogchen and Mahamudra.  Both of these texts are focused on 4 armed white Avalokitshvara, so my speculation here is that this is what was meant by Khorwa Tongtrug derived from kama transmissions.

Ok, a sense organ, in Sanskrit, is referred to as an indriya (but this term indriya covers more than that, faith, for example, is also an indriya). The six āyatanas you are referring to is another name for the six sense organs in the scheme of the twelve āyatanas.

Of the six indriyas (there are twenty-two, in fact), a number are physical, including the sense organs. These five physical sense organs consist of patches of atoms on the sense structure where they are located. For example, the eye sense organ is a patch of atoms shaped like a flower located at the rear of the eyeball. The mental organ is not material.

When the mental organ operates through the physical senses, it takes the name of the sense organ through which it operates. If that operation is disrupted, that sense organ is not active, and there will be no corresponding sense consciousness. So from a Buddhist point of view, anesthesia, literally "without sensation," shuts down the ability of the mind to function through the sense organs, placing one is an an unconscious state.

When you say the mental organ operates through the physical senses, how is this different than the sense base giving rise to consciousness on contact with the sense object (in the ayatana sense)?

Because the sense organ does not give rise to consciousness per se, is the base upon which consciousness receives the sense impression of an object. Consciousness cannot act through more than one sense organ at a time, because it is momentary, serial, and single.

My understanding is that in seeing purely, it would not occur to draw a conclusion as to meaning or lack of meaning; either is a heavy handed projection. Taking account of the Hinayana path which is focused on disrupting the chain of causation at the point of tanha, we're talking about a release, not a heavy handed assumption of nothing (which must stand in contrast to something).

Malcolm wrote:
If there is awareness of something happening, it is an object-related awareness. if we were talking about this in Buddhist terms, this would be called a pratyakṣa, a cognition which is nonconceptual and does not discriminate its object. However, there cannot be direct perception in absence of an external sense object. Therefore, all valid cognitions which do not depend on external sense objects are called "inferences."These are discriminating cognitions.

In Abhidharma, the vijñānaskandha is considered to be nonconceptual, just this present moment of consciousness. There are no layers of consciousness or cognition below it.

This is what is responsible for dreaming.

From a Vajrayāna point of view, when one is in a state of deep sleep, one is completely unconscious because the mind (manas), which rides upon vāyu in the body, has withdrawn into the center of the heart cakra. When one begins to wake, the mind (citta) moves out through the channels of the heart cakra, activating the eight consciousnesses channels which including the six sense consciousness. This is what is responsible for dreaming. When one is fully awake, the mind (vijñāna) not only functions through the eight channels of the heart cakra, but moves through the five physical sense organs as well.

Malcolm wrote:
Ok, a sense organ, in Sanskrit, is referred to as an indriya (but this term indriya covers more than that, faith, for example, is also an indriya). The six āyatanas you are referring to is another name for the six sense organs in the scheme of the twelve āyatanas.

Of the six indriyas (there are twenty-two, in fact), a number are physical, including the sense organs. These five physical sense organs consist of patches of atoms on the sense structure where they are located. For example, the eye sense organ is a patch of atoms shaped like a flower located at the rear of the eyeball. The mental organ is not material.

When the mental organ operates through the physical senses, it takes the name of the sense organ through which it operates. If that operation is disrupted, that sense organ is not active, and there will be no corresponding sense consciousness.

Please explain. I asked. When you say that the gandharva’s “physical body is principally the air element,” do you mean that literally or that it’s a gaseous body composed of what?
And you answered, “Literally.”

Now you say, I’ve taken your answer “too literally” and that it is “physical matter that is in a very motile state”. So, what is it composed of?

And since it’s physical matter, how is it not subject to the physical laws of our world?

Malcolm wrote:
Clyde, I have only agreed to explain to you what the traditional teachings say on the subject, not to engage with you in a debate.

Ancient Buddhist conceived of all matter being as being composed of four states or qualities: earth (solidity), water (liquidity), fire (heat), and air (motility). A rock for example, will be understood to be predominately composed of the earth element, etc.

If you ask me what a gandharva's body is made up of beyond the subtle matter of the air element, I cannot give you that answer, because no such answer is supplied in the ancient literature. If this does not satisfy your wish to understand what ancient Buddhists understood about gandharvas, I am afraid our conversation is now at an end.

This observation actually seems to find confirmation in the assertion as to the non-arising of phenomena - whatever I think is me I've observed is not any basis of my self. Long story short... the only thing I have not been able to reduce is not a thing at all, but simply, awareness. Something is happening, but it defies all definition.

When discussing Buddhist things, it is good to stick with the Buddha's language. The Buddha defined the composition of the universe with six dhātus: earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness (vijñāna). He nowhere described some phenomena termed "awareness" as one of the fundamental constituents of the universe. Since awareness is a cognitive term, it must be included within consciousness, and since there is no such a thing as an objectless awareness by definition, it would be best described as a mental factor that accompanies consciousness, for example, as saṃprajāna, a mental factor that accompanies all mindful states: as in mindful and aware.

I have some understanding of how our senses work, but how does a body composed of air have eyes that see, ears that hear, etc?

So, upon death, one’s mind separates from one’s physical body and instantly reappears in the gandharva. And then, upon conception, one’s mind leaves the gandharva and enter the embryo. Since the gandharva exists in our world (as it must be present at conception), is it subject to the physical laws of our world?


Aside: When is death; i.e., when does the mind leave the body? At the last breath? At the last heart beat? When all neurological activity ceases?


Malcolm wrote:
I will answer the last question first. Death, from a traditional Buddhist point of view, is reckoned from the moment the mind and body of this life separate. That takes place generally within 72 hours of the last breath.

Your problem with the first question is that you are taking the word "air" too literally. You can understand here that "air refers to physical matter that is in a very motile state, what you earlier described as gaseous, but that really does not grasp the concept here.

As for your second question, when your mind separates from the body in this life, it immediately appropriates a subtle body, and this being, which you have now become, is called a gandharva. The Gandharva, according to the ancient Buddhist conception of it, can pass through more coarse matter, is clairvoyant, etc., so not entirely confined by what we call "physical laws."

How 'bout changing the constitution so that sparsely populated rural states don't hold the rest of the country captive? Wyoming only has 500,000+ people, while California has 37 million (I think that's the number). In other words, the population of California is 16+ times that of Wyoming. Yet both only get two Senators. That means every vote in Wyoming is 16 times more powerful than a single vote in California.

This may have made sense at the time of the framing of the Constitution when the original 13 states had pretty similar populations, but it makes no sense now. This kind of systemic inequity is one of the reasons people (and especially younger people) don't vote. The Dems in this election cast 12 million more votes than the Republicans.

Malcolm; Thank you again. However, while I understand your explanation, it doesn’t answer my questions.

The Buddha is reported to have spoken of the three conditions necessary for the birth of a human being which includes the presence of a gandharva, but what are the conditions for the arising of a gandharva or does it simply arise at the death of a being? And is it only the death of a human being or any sentient being? And what are the conditions for the passing away of a gandharva; i.e., does the gandharva cease a conception?

It seems that the gandharva is a bodiless being (“spirit”), yes? And the gandharva is composed of the five skandhas, yes? How is that possible without a body and the sense organs?


p.s: Given a succession of states from gandharva to human to gandharva to human . . ., one could just as easily call the human state the intermediate state!


Malcolm wrote:
This has been explained, but I will explain it again. [Begin by placing your mind in the cosmological world view of the four elements] The body of a bardo being is made up principally of the element air, so bardo beings have a body, but it's physical body is principally the air element. The other four aggregates are mental, being mind and its mental factors.

The gandharva arises after the dis-integration or breaking up, of the five aggregates of this life at death. One's mind immediately appropriates this "subtle" body, which in the first three weeks after death, resembles the body of the deceased in features and proportion. However, being subtle, it is not visible to ordinary people. It has all senses organs because it has a subtle body. The kind of birth they have— out of the four types of birth, apparitional, warmth and moisture birth, egg birth, and womb birth— is apparitional birth, like devas, pretas, and hell beings. Gandharvas persist in the bardo for a maximum of 49 days. This time period is deceptive, because time does not function in the bardo the same way we perceive it. These forty nine "days" can elapse in moments, in any case, the classical time period is 49 human days.

When a gandharva enters the womb at conception it loses consciousness, and is not longer a bardo being, so it "passes away."

Other than the buying fentanyl in stores part, that is not a "fringe" view in any way. Decriminalization has been a success (inasmuch as it's possible to define one with addiction and drug related crime) in virtually any developed country which has tried (Portugal is a recent example), and some level of decriminalization is supported across a broad swathe of professions, organizations etc.

Oh, for the most part, I'm with you, and I do think decriminalization is where we should be going... complete deregulation, which Malcolm seems to be on board with, I'm not there. I don't think its a good idea to make stuff like fentanyl and other "hard" drugs available with cigarettes and alcohol. If that makes me fringe, then I'm fine with that.

Malcolm wrote:
In Portugal, they completely decriminalized all drugs—in other words, you can shoot heroin in front of the police and they won't arrest you—reallocating law enforcement dollars to treatment programs.  As a result, drug addiction rates have been significantly reduced in that country. Simultaneously, the prison population was reduced, and law enforcement can spend their time on real crimes.

I'd like you challenge you on this point. How has America not lost manufacturing jobs to Mexico?

I am thinking particularly about General Motors plants & associated workforces.
Such upsides of trade often escape notice, because while the costs are highly concentrated in specific industries like auto manufacturing, the benefits of a deal like NAFTA are distributed widely across society. Supporters of NAFTA estimate that some fourteen million jobs rely on trade with Canada and Mexico, while the nearly two hundred thousand export-related jobs created annually by the pact pay 15 to 20 percent more on average than the jobs that were lost.

Malcolm wrote:

In fact, NAFTA initially had a terrible impact on Mexico, and was the major driver of migration to the US between 1994-2007. In other words, the US caused the immigration crisis, and the Republicans, rather than taking responsibility for their own radical free-trade posture, are now retreating into a form of racist isolationism to "solve" problems they themselves had a large hand in creating.

Vegetable prices may be going up soon, as a shortage of migrant workers is resulting in lost crops in California.

Farmers say they’re having trouble hiring enough people to work during harvest season, causing some crops to rot before they can be picked. Already, the situation has triggered losses of more than $13 million in two California counties alone, according to NBC News.

The ongoing battle about U.S. immigration policies is blamed for the shortage. The vast majority of California’s farm workers are foreign born, with many coming from Mexico. However, the PEW Research Center reports more Mexicans are leaving the U.S. than coming here.

We have the same problem this year. Americans do not want to work in the fields. 1) they can't take the heat. 2) they don't want those jobs in any case. So the idea that migrant workers are displacing American labor is completely false. Migrant workers are also not, in general, depressing wages for Americans.

There is a minor problem in the tech industry, where H1-B visas put downward pressure on wages in Silicon Valley, while simultaneously making technology more affordable for the American consumer. Even with the wage suppression effect, however, the average tech worker makes 105K (boo hoo). See this article: http://fortune.com/2017/02/15/h1-b-silicon-valley-wages/

Thank you. I wonder if I could ask you about the nature of gandharvas.

In the Mahatanhasankhaya Sutta which I quoted above, it speaks of the three conditions necessary for a human birth which includes the existence of a gandharva. What are the conditions necessary for the birth of a gandharva? Would it be correct to say that what is born after the death of a human being is a gandharva? (And perhaps, what is born after the death of the gandharva is a human being?) And how are the skandhas of a gandharva different (“subtle types”?) than the skandhas of a human being?

Malcolm wrote:
Think of it this way:

When you reside in New York, you are known as a New Yorker. But if you get on a train to  to move to LA, now you are known as a "passenger," and will remain so until you reach your destination.

You can think of the bardo as Penn Station. You can think of the six realms as six cities to which you might move, such as Washington DC and so on.

All beings who pass away spend 49 days in the intermediate state before they take rebirth as a being in one of the six realms. Any being in the bardo is known as a gandharva, just as any one on a train in known as a passenger (apart from engineer, conductors, and transit cops).

And of course this is only one small point in a much larger argument.

The point is that the fact that there was an earlier witness to a Sanskrit original, that is, an earlier translation, puts into question Nattier's idea that the Heart Sūtra was a Chinese psuedographia.

Whatever syntax issues there are with the grammar can be understood differently. For example, it could have been written down in Central Asia in an ungrammatical Sanskrit, by someone who had formal knowledge of Sanskrit, but who was not a native Indian, there are many possibilities which have not been examined.

But on the other hand, we know that Indians accepted the text as canonical by 800 with the arrival of Vimalamitra to Tibet. So, they apparently were comfortable with whatever grammatical novelties the text presented and made no mention of them in any commentary of which I aware.

Federal investigators said Morrow’s apartment doubled as a “homemade explosives laboratory.” There was a trove of white-supremacist literature in Morrow’s home, according to the F.B.I. But local cops, citing Morrow’s clean-cut demeanor and standout record as a quality-control manager at a local food-processing plant, made sure to note that just because he had this material didn’t mean he was a white supremacist. “He could have been an individual that was doing research,” the local police chief said.

A couple of observations:

The term "true self" is nowhere used in any Indian or Tibetan Buddhist text, not even in gzhan stong texts.

Even in the Uttaratantra, where we find the Tibetan term, dam pa'i bdag in the discussion of ātmapāramitā, the Sanskrit text simply gives the term as ātma. The " dam pa " was added by Ngog Lotsawa to distinguish this "self," free from the proliferation of the self [i.e. existence] imputed by the hindus and nonself [i.e. nonexistence] imputed by śrāvakas, as  a quality of the dharmakāya, — in other words, it is another way of saying the dharmakāya is free from extremes.  This usage in the Uttaratantra comes from contrasting the impurity, nonidentity, suffering, and impermanence of compounded phenomena, with the purity, identity, bliss, and permanence of dharmakāya. But if someone should think this contextual usage of "self" with respect to dharmakāya means dharmakāya is an existent self, they have not understood anything of Mahāyāna at all, let alone Dzogchen, or even Buddhadharma for that matter.

With respect to the term bdag nyid chen po, it is a somewhat rare Dzogchen technical term, also found in the Guhyagarbha literature. Even so, its usage is very restricted. In his commentary on the Kun byed rgyal po, Khenpo Zhenphen Ozer glosses it as rang byung ye shes.

What?  A gandharva is a class of beings.  Not all sentient beings arise as gandharva.  Do you mean as an embryo (Amagarbha)?

A being in the bardo is also called a gandharva, not the same thing as the nonhuman beings called gandharvas.

Please explain your arising without using Causes and Conditions?

One can't explain arising with causes and conditions. As Nāgārjuna points out in the MMK:

An entity does not arise from an entity. 
An entity does not arise from a nonentity. 
A nonentity does not arise from an entity.
A nonentity does not arise from a nonentity. 
Where then can there be arising?

"Arising from causes and conditions" is merely a convention which cannot withstand ultimate analysis.
