One day Candrakirti was walking through a passageway in Nalanda, his head in a book, and he bumped his head on a pillar -- a student saw this and said "Aha! That pillar is not so empty, is it!". Candra looked at him, and passed his hand right through the pillar much to the student's embarassed astonishment. Or so this traditional story runs.

Of course there is kashina meditation -- ostensibly, if you meditate on the kashina of earth, you gain control over the earth element and can travel through mountains, etc.

It is my opinion that the apparent solidity of phenomena such as trees and rocks, etc., is directly related to the solidity of one's delusion. The more solid one's delusion, the more solid apparent phenomena seem.

On the other hand, people with very solid delusions regularly kill themselves too, through not recognizing that solid things will kill them, like the ground when they attempt to fly off buildings.

But is said also in the suttas that the Buddha once levitated to an elevation of 14 palm trees. Such yogic feats are described too often in Buddhist texts generation after generation for me to simply reject them out of hand.

Could this "book of Indian letters" be some sort of dictionary and he was just back translating from Chinese into Sanskrit, then Tibetan?  Why say he then "established it"; why not simply write "he translated it."?

Malcolm wrote:
No,it cannot mean that.

It means that he had an Indian manuscript of the textin front of him. Established here means somthing like "edited it". Means he translated it and checked it for accuracy.

It is quite likely he had a Chinese version with him as well. Many early sutras translated into Tibetan were translations which triangulated between Sanskrit originals and Chinese translations.

For example, here is another colophon for the 'phags pa legs nyes kyi rgyu dang 'bras bu bstan pa zhes bya ba theg pa chen po'i mdo

zhus chen gyi lo tstsha ba bande chos grub kyis rgya gar dang rgya'i dpe las bsgyur cing zhus te gtan la phab pa/

The Zhuchen Lotsawa, the monk Chosdrup, translated it from an Indian and an Chinese text, edited it and established it.

Or here from one of the Ratnakuta sutras, the āryāyuṣmannandagarbhāvakrāntinirdeśa

lo tstsha ba 'gos chos grub kyis rgya nag gi dpe las bsgyur cing zhus te gtan la phab pa

Lotsawa Gos Chosdrup translated from a Chinese book, edited it, and established it.

I will grant you however, it seems that our Lotsawa Gos here is more comfortable with Chinese than Sanskrit. However, given than the Sanskrit was available to Gos at the time, and that he knew it, it seems unlikely he translated the Lanka directly from Chinese.

And I would say you have a full deck.

You see, in chapter 15 of MMK Nagaruna asks, where is there an existent not included in svabhāva (inherent existence) or parabhāva (dependent existence defined as a stealth version of svabhāva in the previous verse)? He then goes on to say that if existents are not established, then non-existents are not established, since a non-existent is normally defined by people as something which existed before, does not exist now. Having set this out, he then says, whoever has a view involving existents, non-existents, inherent existents or dependent existents does not understand Buddha's view. He then cites the Reply to Katyayana, the only sutra cited in the whole of the MML i.e. "The world is bound by a duality, "It is" and "It is not".

Seeking to understand the ultimate nature of existence, one practices the methods of meditation for clarity, however, meditation directed to clarifying something is far from the equanimity of the state free of concepts.

When one loosely rests vidyā in its own state, after coarse and subtle concepts come to calmly rest on their own, vidyā vividly abides in its own state. That śamatha is called “dwelling in the essence of vidyā”. In that state there is no lethargy or agitation in vidyā. Clarity, pristine lucidity, vividness, nakedness, and limpidity respectively cannot be seen with the eye, cannot be described with words, and cannot be established as a thing. The clarity that is like seeing, the pristine lucidity that is like an experience, the vividness that is like description, the nakedness that is like apprehending a thing, and the limpidity that is like a thought occurs in vidyā in and of itself. That alone is the wisdom of vipaśyāna. Though śamatha and vipaśyāna are given two separate names, in essence there is no difference.

Some scientists, like Dennet, et al, are certainly of the opinion that there is no such a thing as a mind at all.

One of more impressive western scholars on the question of the hard problem of consiousness is Colin McGinn, whom I once had the pleasure of hearing speak. He argues, pretty well in my opinion, that the nature of consciousness is cognitively closed to human minds i.e. that in some sense we are frogs in a well and that our view is limited to what we can see out of the top of it.

Actually, Buddha, in the Eastern Gatehouse Sutta, asserted the opposite -- those who do not have direct knowledge need to accept it on faith from people who do. The Sutta spoken to the Kalamas was spoken to non-buddhists who were confused by all the competing claims made by itinerant religious teachers who visited them. In the end, in that Sutta, Buddha does not teach any thing especially Buddhist, but gave them the brahma viharas, asserting that those who practiced these would take rebirth in a better place, and even if they did not beleive in rebirth, this practice would improve their lives as they were. But the four bhrama viharas are not a specifically Buddhist practice and therefore are never held to lead to liberation. They are the practice of the "vehicles of gods and humans".

The perspective on this in Tibetan Buddhism comes from the second chapter of Dharmakirti's Pramanasiddhi, where he systematically excludes physicalism. This text is shared by all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, and no one disagrees with its points. The reason why people disagree with Tsongkhapa is that his explanations of things are not discernable in Indian Madhyamaka literature, which he himself admits, combined with his and his disciples assertion that Tsongkhapa's Madhyamaka view came about largely as a result of a series of spiritual encounters he had with the bodhisattva Mañjuśrī, and not out of his personal intellectual investigations.

I don't feel threatened by research into cogntion and the brain. You might think that knowledge about the relationship between the brain and sense organs is modern, not know to Tibetan Buddhists before the 20th centruy -- but in point of fact Tibetan Medicine was aware of the connection between the brain, sense organs and internal organs from at least the 11th century and understood the function of the brain was to act as a central processsor for sense data, as well as the organ that goverend motor impulses, internal organ function, so on and so forth.

Scientic studies only confirm what some Buddhists have already known for millenia -- entities in causal relationships have no intrinsic nature or essence. If entities did, they would not need to be in causal relationships.

The primary difference between Buddhist schools was in how far down they were willing to extend that analysis. The non-Mahāyāna schools stopped at paramanus i.e. "atoms"; the Mahāyāna Yogacara school stopped at consciousness. Madhyamaka extended its analysis all the way and came up with emptiness as the basis of reality i.e. that in the end, reality has no objective basis whatsoever.

The unwillingness to entertain the idea that yogis may possess knowledge that cannot be tested for in a lab is a form of lacking of curiosity.

The only thing these experiments prove is what Buddhists have been saying all along, mind and matter can interact, conventionally speaking. Pet scans don't work on formless realm beings. You would assert it is because they don't exist. Buddhists would assert that it is because they do not have physical bodies. As I said, you can only verify their existence yogically. You cannot share that perception directly in an empirical or testable fashion, because not everyone has the same capacity to do develop the necessary skills to perceive devas in the form and formless realms.

Seriously, though, great last few pages. I particularly like the breakdown of the brain constituents and molecular comparison to a rock. I've had a sense of vague unease at times when others talk about sentient beings and vegetarianism and the idea is always raised that plants are not sentient beings. I always think of the famous experiments which show some sort of reaction from plants in response to negative or positive actions in their presence (not even necessarily to the plant itself). The plants don't have a brain, but the mind isn't found in the brain. In relation to what I've learned and pondered these past couple days about energy, there is something interesting yet unknowable here...


Malcolm wrote:
All living things have tsal. But while plants have a hormonal system, they lack a neural system, and while the mind is not reducible to the brain and neural system, in any thing we define as sentient there is always at least a rudimentary neural network. Also, information transfer in plants depends on hormones, while information transfer in animals depends on neurons i.e. when a plant is attacked, it communicates that by releasing hormones, when an animal is attacked, it fire neurons.

The ultimate result of Dzogchen is an abiding nirvana.

Just to shake things up even more, it's a must to read this book as an overview of contemporary scientific research into intelligence in life forms other-than-human, --including plants (that make decisions, interact with their environments, and appear to feel pain) and slime molds which solve mazes. Warning-- the contents of this book certainly do challenge some long-held Buddhist beliefs about the limits of "sentience" .

I just wanted to clarify that whether an insect can or can't feel pain is not a reflection of whether or not it is sentient. As before, some human's can't feel pain, but that doesn't mean they are not sentient. Just as humans lack the sensory capabilities to detect gamma rays, but are sentient, insects lack a centralized nervous system which would make it impossible for them to experience pain as we currently understand it. But, we may understand it wrong. Either way, this doesn't mean they are not aware or conscious at all.

Our bodies, essentially, are composed of rtsal which is expressed in our ignorance as the five outer and inner elements.

When pracitioners eat the flesh of those who have been killed (necessarily by someone else, not at our specific encouragement, nor have we seen the animal killed) a postive cause is created for this being. Why? Because a connection is made through the field of rtsal which also includes minds.

Since we don't eat anything but cattle, pigs, goats, sheep, fowl, fish and seafood, these animals are in some sense luckier than others, they are more closely associated with human beings, and more likely to wind up in the diet of practitioners.

It is not a question of ability, it is question of knowledge. When you know how everything is connected through rtsal, then such questions about the mechanisms by which a practitioner consuming the flesh of some unfortunate animal benefits that animal becomes very obvious.

The reason why Ganapujas have a powerful effect is that there is no more power an offering than offering to the Guru. If your ganapuja is just a dry ritual, then of course it will have little benefit.

Malcolm wrote:
I have explained this now several ways. So, I'll try again: there are no sentient beings at the time of the latent basis, because all sentient beings, theoretically, acheived some kind of buddhahood in the last eon. The notion of the basis in Dzogchen man ngag sde is very similar to the Hindu idea of Pralaya. [In fact, in the term kun gzhi, ālaya, kun = ā, gzhi = laya. The term kun gzhi is distinguished from the term gzhi in Dzogchen, as you can easily find out, but the fact that gzhi is desceribed as the bardo of samara and nirvana is nothing if not telling. If someone is taking a text critical approach, they will note that there is a movement in Buddhist tantric texts in India in the late 9th through the 10th century in such texts as the Samputa tantra and the Kalacakra to borrow and repurpose some Samkhya concepts. Hence Dzogchen use of the term prakriti, etc.]

After the collapse of the previous universe, there are no buddhas and sentient beings -- and this is called the bardo of samsara and nirvana. Present in the latent basis however is a neutral awareness which does not know itself.

Because of traces of action and affliction remain from previous universe, the basis is stirred, lights shine out, and they are either recognized or not, resulting in samasara and nirvana.

This neutral awareness is what happens when someone acheives an incomplete full awakening, for example an arhat or some other form of lesser iberation that can "return to the cause". This is why Dzogchen makes such a big deal about Dzogchen Buddhahood being one that "does not return to the cause".

gad rgyangs said:
have sentient beings existed since beginningless time alongside the basis, but not arising from it?

Malcolm wrote:
The Dzogchen answer is no. Sentient beings newly arise at the end of each bardo of samsara and nirvana.

How do they arise? They arise when neutral awarenesss in the basis makes the error of not recognizing the display of the a basis as its own display. The imputing ignorance results in self and other, the ālaya forms, the twelve links start up, samsara and nirvana divide. Etc.

As I mentioned above, Dzoghchen texts do not distinguish whether this neutral awareness in the basis is multiple or singular.

So this question is left for us to solve on our own: either the neutral awareness of basis is multiple, not entirely satisfying for a number of reasons, but this explains how there are individual mind streams from the start; or it is singular (not entirely satisfying for a number of reasons), but gets warped by the presence of trace afflictions into individuated sentient beings; or is it neither singular or multiple (not entirely satisfying for a number of reasons) and gets warped by the presence of trace afflictions into individuated sentient beings. In the last two scenarios, the inability of awakened people to completely eradicate all traces of afflictions leaves traces of affliction left over, where they act as seeds for new sentient beings. There is a passage in the Gongpa Zangthal that describes wisdom as "the accumulator of traces".

when ye shes takes an object it becomes rig pa (or rather ye shes stirs and becomes a duality of rigpa and object)? what then is "resting in rig pa", what is the object then?

Malcolm wrote:
Awarenesses [shes pa rnams] in the basis are neutral, meaning they are not afflicted, but they possess innate ignorance since they not know themselves. When there is a stirring in the basis and the light of wisdom shines out, then these awarenesses either recognize it, in which case their shes pa becomes a shes rab and they know [vidyā] the basis as their own state; or they reify appearance of the five lights as an object through the imputing ignorance and this sets into motion I-making, dependent origination and all the rest of it, and their shes pa becomes rnam shes.

BTW, the texts themselves do not speak of the shes pas in the plural. They just use the the term shes pa lung ma bstan.

Hi Namdrol,

Perhaps I was being a bit more granular than I wanted to be.  This is the context in which I was using the word "causation":

The accumulation of merit leads to the meeting of Dzogchen teachings, which leads to receiving Direct Introduction, which leads to the eventual recognition of rigpa.  So:

merit ---> Direct Introduction ---> recognition of rigpa.

Does this sound about right?


Malcolm wrote:
Not at the time fo the basis; after the basis has arisen and samsara and nirvana have split, then this is correct. I.e. it is correct for sentient being. At the time of the basis however there are neither buddhas nor sentient beings, hence it is called the bardo of samsara and nirvana.

then this implies that the sentient being exists first, and then fails to recognize its state, which results in it being a sentient being, which is a circular regress.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes.

As I have stated elsewhere, Dzogchen cosmology is just a minor variation on the standard abhidharma cosmology. In Abhidharmakośa, at the end of the eon, all sentient beings are reborn in the two upper form realms, where their minds are in a state of dharmatā. After twenty anatarakalpas, intermediate eons, because of traces of latent afflictions, the air mandala forms and so on, resulting in a container universe which is repopulated by sentient beings who take birth in it from top to bottom.

In Dzogchen, at the end of the previous mahākalpa, all sentient beings attain "buddhahood" after taking birth in the Kalavinkaloka. Then after twenty thousand eons while samsara and nirvana does not appear (this is called the bardo (antara) of samsara and nirvana in dzogchen texts), because of the lingering traces of affliction and action left over from the last eon, the basis becomes stirred, the five lights shine out and there is a chance for recognition or non-recognition by the neutral awareness(es) that is/are obscured by the innate ignorance of mere non-recognition while the basis is in a latent state. Depending on the fact of recognition or non-recognition, there is Samantabhadra and sentient beings.

Thus, we understand that the basis has two phases, active and latent. During the bardo of samsara and nirvana, it is in a latent phase.

Jnana said:
There are also other conservative interpretations on the role and importance of karmamudrā. For example, Chomdan Rigpey Raltri's Dohālaṃkārapuṣpa (Do ha rgyan gyi me tog):
People who do not know [that] the nature of everything [is] co-emergence claim that unadulterated great bliss is attained while engaging in sexual union with a karmamudrā. They are mistaken, like the thirsty wild deer who sees a mirage as water, goes running after it and gets injured. They die from thirst; can they get water from the sky? Similarly, [such people] mistake the bliss of the four joys to be primordial awareness, and do not realize co-emergence. For this reason, since that bliss which is born from sexual union has no capacity to give rise to and sustain co-emergence, where can it complete the realization [which is] free of the three worlds, [i.e.] the three doors? Well, it cannot complete this.

Malcolm wrote:
Correct. The bliss of karmaudra practice is just a tool. In the lamdre system, it is called the practice of small bliss and emptiness and is connected with the third consecration. It does not produce a final result since it works by purifying the the white and red bodhicitta. For that, you need the practices of the jñānavāyu, the wisdom winds (albiet still practiced with either sort of mudra), termed in Lamdre, great bliss and emptiness -- the practice that transforms the karmavāyus into jñānav̄ayus -- thus resulting in rainbow body, as in Dzogchen.

The main advantage of Dzogchen togal over these practices is that a) it does not require a consort b) it does not require the step by step purification of the four mandalas through the two stages (i.e. the outer body channel mandala, the inner channel syllable mandala, the bodhicitta mandala, and the vāyu mandala). This is why togal is sometimes equated with the completion stage practices of the gsar ma system.

The practice of tregchö, the inseperabilty of samsara and nirvana of Sakya, mahāmudra of Kagyu, and clear light nature of the mind of the Gelugpas have essentially the same point i.e. cultivating a momentary unfabricated awareness.

Dzogchenpas maintain however that this cultivation of a momentary unfabricated awareness by itself will not result in rainbow body, but rather, will result only in the the body dissolving at death into subtle particles.  In Nyingma, Sakya and Gelug, it seems this cultivation of a momentary unfabricated awareness forms the basis for the pratice the two stages, whereas Kagyu dissents, and asserts that this meditation alone can be sufficient for a person of supreme caliber.

In any event, the main point of the view in all four (or five if we included Jonang) schools is the experiential cultivation of a momentary unfabricated awareness. Other than that, the main differences are terminolgies related to the specifics of each schools presentation of their respective paths and methodologies.

Imputing ignorance [kun brtags ma rig pa] reifies the basis as a self and an other. This ignorance does not exist in the basis, has never existed in the basis and will never exist in the basis. Nevertheless, the basis, nature, essence and compassion, serve as its cause in the sense that it is the basis which is reified. However, the basis itself is free from reification and therefore any sort of enumeration. Even the notion of three wisdoms of essence, nature and compassion is merely a way of talking about the basis which in fact has one essence.

Individuals occur because the basis was not recognized at the beginning of the eon, when the neutral awareness [shes pa lung ma bstan, jñāvyakrta] in the basis became conscioussness [rnam shes, vijñāna] through not recognizing the basis as its own state due to the imputing ignorance mentioned above. When that nuetral awareness recognizes the basis as its own display, it becomes prajñā [shes rab] through knowing [rig pa, vidyā] the basis as its own display, there is effortless buddhahood in the state of realization called "Samantabhadra".

Sentient beings in others words are merely a continuation of ignorance about our own true state.

The answer of course is that inviduals are neither the same nor different than the basis. If they were the same, the basis would afflicted, if they were utterly different, sentient beings could not becomes buddhas through recognizing the basis as their own state.

Also bear in mind that the term "basis" is applied to the three wisdoms because they have not been realized. When the three wisdoms are realized, then they are termed the fruit and one rests on the stage of great original purity, uttarajñāna, highest wisdom.

Thanks. I've got enough 'practices' lined up as it is, but if upon reading about the Longsal preliminaries we decide that it's more effective, then it can only help to adjust our practice for the better. Of course it's important too to work with what we have and stick to it, instead of going something like "Oh, I now have a Lung for this other better practice, I'd better learn it first before I start practicing."

If there is any danger in "Yoga", it's that most mainstream "Yoga" studios don't teach Hatha Yoga for its original purpose: To prepare the body for deep meditation.

It seems that most "Yoga" studios nowadays only, whether intentionally or unintentionally, teach people how to increase their vanity and lust; and charge an arm & a leg to boot (whether for overpriced classes, supplies, clothing, mats, etc.)

Better to learn Yantra Yoga instead, and from a qualified source.

Hatha Yoga can be very benecifial too though, that is with proper guidance (even if only from an authentic book) and Right Intention.

The whole network of dependent origination is insubstantial. There are no substantial members which belong to anything dependently originated. Substantiality is a deluded mental appearance.

Namdrol-la,

You are allowed to teach Dzogchen. What if someone like Padma came to you with his story, what would you say? Why would he have to learn Tibetan (colloquial or Tibetan)? How would that get rid of his doubts? I know you don't want to teach but I am genuinely curious as Padma isn't the only one with doubt.
The advice to practice more seems not to work perfectly well either as the problem is doubt. Not just doubt about the whole tradition but also doubt about whether the practice is done right. At the same time we hear stories that if the practice is done wrongly, the results will be disastrous. So, the practice more exhortation does not work in this case. At least, that is what I think.

Just curious about your opinion.

Thanks, C

Malcolm wrote:
If someone comes to me with doubts, I generally send that person back to their teacher. In Padma's case, he should try and get his hands on ChNN's Upadesha on All-Penetrating Wisdom (ye shes zang thal), Longsal Series Volume three. If he attended the recent webcast, ChNN gave the Longsal transmission of Yeshe Zangthal in the last open retreat, not the lung, but the transmission. This book also contains the Longsal Ngondro for which ChNN gave the lung in the last retreat. So he should have no trouble procuring this text. I personally found this one short text to be something like a key that deepened my understanding of Dzoghen beyond tregchö and unlocked the meaning of many tantras.

BTW, in tregchö, that is it. All you are doing just totaly relaxing in a state of instant presence. It does not make anything better but if you are relaxed, you don't mind, also if things are better, you don't mind. If you are not being relaxed, then you are not understanding the main point of tregchö. So you must learn and apply the four chozhags. Cog (ཅོག) is an ancient Tibetan word that means all. It also means to have leisure. Shag (གཞག) means to let go. So this is why ChNN translates this as total relaxation. There are four points of cogzhag which should be applied together at the same time. It is not hard to learn what this means, as I recall ChNN talked about this in the last retreat.

Astus said:
What constitutes orthodoxy (including orthopraxy) in Vajrayana? What is its definition? Or is it that there are several definitions? What are they?

I find that faith is emphasised as an essential key to Vajrayana practice. However, is it based on pure faith in the tantras, the lineage and the guru, or there are objective criteria for what makes a teaching Vajrayana? What are the requirements of a lineage, transmission, treasure text? Is it possible at all to separate transmission from the teaching, or they implicitly require each other? What is the guarantee for a transmission to be true?

What would be good to have here are actual references in answer for the above questions, and then some extra discussion of them.

Malcolm wrote:
There are ten criteria that define a valid tantra, for example. But the Dzogchen tradition throws them away.

The real difference between sutra and tantra is the following: yoga tantra and highest yoga tantra has a method based on transmission of an example wisdom communicated by a guru, a physiologically based understanding of meditation and the path, a concept of wisdom being physicaly embodied in the center of the body, the theory of mind and vāyu interactivity; teachings on ṇāḍī, vāyu and bindu which is crucial to tantric praxis, the so called body method. All of these features are almost completely lacking in lower and non-Vajrayāna teachings.

As far as transmission goes, the Nyingmapas argue that all Mahāyāna teachings are treasure texts. The gsar ma schools were predicated on bringing back new Indian texts. So Sakya, Gelug and Jonang tend to emphasize the new tantras as being more authentic since they have a clearer Indian pedigree. Kagyus go both ways, historically -- that is to say. Nyingmapas have developed various polemics to defend continued text production. Basically, the Nyingma collection of tantras is not closed, the Kengyur and Tengyur are closed. I am a student of three different tertons who have produced "new" tantras.

One cannot separate transmission from the teaching. The transmission is true if a) the teacher teaching it has personal realization of the teaching, or his lineage is unbroken. The first is the best of course, but most people get the latter. Of course there are no guarantees at all.

So you agree with MS and, for Candrakirti, a truth [satya] means an object, and each "object" is really two objects...

Malcolm wrote:
Not exactly, a truth is "an object of a cognition" -- you cannot leave the cognition part off since it is integral to the definition. A truth is not merely an object, it is an object defined as relative or utlimate depending upon whether the cognition is deceived or undeceived. One object, two natures, hence two cognitions, correct and false.

This is an development over the Abhidharmic concept of a truth, in which a truth [satya] is a cognition, for example, a cognition of water is a relative truth, whereas a cognition of the characteristics of water, limpidity, wetness and coolness, are ultimate truths.

In other words, here,in Abhidharma, an ultimate truth is defined as the irreducible cognition that remains after something (such as a cup or water) has been subjected to complete analysis.

There really isn't than much difference between this and the Madhyamaka definition. The Madhyamaka definition might run something like "...an ultimate truth is defined as the object of an unmistaken cognition that remains after something (such as a cup or water) has been subjected to complete analysis."

The emphasis in both causes, both in Abhidharma and Madhyamaka is on the cognition. So no, I do not agree with the MS discussion in all respects.

But anyway, it does not matter. Pre-Yogacara Madhyamakas [i.e. pre Shantarakṣita] accepted the standard cognitive model of Abhidharma, so for them it was proper to speak of objects, organs and sense consciousnesses. So in fact your whole line of inquiry is in vain. For them, there were, conventionally speaking, given objects in precisely the terms to which you object. For them, from Nagarjuna onwards, without the meeting of a cup, for example, and a healthy eye organ [i.e a functional patch of atoms in the shape of a flax flower in the back of the eye], and an eye consciousness operating through that sense organ, there could be no eye-consciousness of a cup at all. Three things are required for an instance of vision, in the Madhyamaka model.

Face it, my statement was just not a problem from a classical Madhyamaka point of view so I am not going to spend anymore time on this. Why? Because this is non-controversial.

If you mean by an "entity" something which possesses being, then we are in agreement —  any perception predicated on perceiving an entity as existent is an incorrect cognition.

Apparents are a given, that is what it means when Nagarjuna states that one understands ultimate truth through relative truth. If they are not a given that the classical statement "Matter is empty, emptiness is matter..." etc., is unintelligible.

We have to have "given" objects because we do not reject appearances in classical Madhyamaka. We understand that appearances arise in dependence. What we reject about appearances is not the appearance itself, rather, that it has any underlying realty. For example, a moon in the water.

This is quite different than yogacara where appearances themselves in their totality are rejected.

In terms of language or rhetoric, Nagarjuna's method works so well, and frustrates so many, because it is based on two truths, and two truths is effectively two contexts from which to interpret anything, be it the true/false value of truthbearers (like statements, perceptions, cognitions), or the real/unreal value of objects (like whether something exists).

So one cannot say "p is true" because it is not true in all contexts.  Similarly, one cannot say "p is false" because Nagarjuna again shifts to the other context.  Same method works for statements about existence.

Malcolm wrote:
What Candrakirti is saying is that Nagarjuna is saying that any given entity someone perceives can be perceived either correctly or incorrectly.

Among incorrect perceptions of objects there is a further subdivision; true relative truth and false relative truth. A true relative truth is somethat that is efficient and producing a result, for example, a wheat seed that produces a wheat sprout. Such observed efficiency provides the basis for consensus reality. False relative truths are conventional delusions, for example, a drunk who has doubled vision or a juandice patient who perceives everything as yellowed.

Ultimate truths are always true no matter the context. Relative truths are contextual. For example, the relative truth of the speed of light breaks down when gravitational conditions are altered the event horizon of a black hole, for example. However, we can connect these relative truths on a continuum by understand their context so they remain generally true even when they are not specificially true.

Malcolm wrote:
No, what you said as that the imputed identity was parikalpita. Look back at what you said.

The three own natures have to do with how objects themselves are deluded cognitions (parikalpita) i.e. mental states (caittas) which arise from the activation of seeds (bijas) stored in the alayavijñāna (paratantra). When those appearances are recognized as being mere mental states, and non-existent in the ālayavijñāna itself, then the ālayavijñāna transforms into wisdom (parinispanna). Paratantra only refers to the ālayavijñāna.

Basically, if you want to talk about Yogacara this is not the thread to do it.

As I said, what I stated it basically pulled directly from MAv -- and as you know, Candra, later in this text, demolishes the three own nature thoery altogether.

Anyway, here is a potential problem with Nagarjuna's reliance on Ratnakuta Sutra:  If we just blindly "accept what the world accepts" then, on the conventional at least, "a Madhyamika's principal epistemic task [is] just to passively acquiesce and duplicate." (MS152.)

It is a trivialization of the idea of truth.  If truth means nothing, then qualifying it with "conventional" or "ultimate" adds little.

Malcolm wrote:
First things first -- truths (satyas) are objects of cognitions -- which can be either correct (ultimate) or false (relative). Since you are studying Gelug influenced discourse, this may not be immediately evident to you.

This means that if you see something that you identify as salt, and it functions as salt, this cognition is true in so far as it is efficient.

When you analyze that appearance for some fundamental saltiness in that appearance of salt, that cognition of salt fails because no fundamental saltiness will or can be found. In other words, relative truths are true so long as they are not investigated, that is, so long as the appearance which produces the cognition which lables that appearance is not analyzed to discover whether or not there is an essence which produces the identification of the given appearance in question.

A relative truth is the subject of a cognition that is not in possession of the fact that the given apparent phenomena being perceived as an object of said cognition lacks the identity imputed to it. An ultimate truth is an object of a cogniton which is in possession of the fact that the given apparent phenomena being perceived as an object of said cognition lacks the identity imputed to it and does not perceive the identity which is non-existent in that object of cognition.

The function of the two truths is to lead to the cessation of proliferation about identity. The lack of identity within phenomena and persons alone is emptiness and nothing else.

Certainly that is how it is explained but certain people in Tibetan Buddhism.

Others explain it differntly i.e. it is method for inducing rapid accomplishment. For example, in Lamdre, there is union yoga both below and above the path of seeing.

This relates somewhat to what David Chapman was talking about in the Aro thread i.e. that "tantra" or the erotic elements in Vajrayāna have been somewhat suppressed.  Probably a necessary consequence of Vajrayāna in monasteries. But in reality, tantric practice in India was more liberal. There is also cultural issues -- Indians have a more eroticized culture than Tibet.

Apropos of whether an invented history & lineage are problematic for Dzogchenpas:

I saw many carnivorous creatures devouring them and many denizens of hell hurling accusations of misdeeds at them.
This is from Delog Dawa Drolma's account of her experiences in the various realms, recorded in English in Delog (p. 82).  I assume this text has some authority in this forum and in this thread.

I would like to know if there is any plausible rebuttal to the position that our friends involved in a "vajra romance" with the Aro scene are, in fact, students of ordinary people who are pretending to be lamas, as Dawa Drolma puts it.  This is the primary critique against Aro, that it's phony.  It's clear to me from this and other sources that if it's phony, then it's a problem.  But the problem goes away if David or anyone else can show it's not phony.  Well?

Mahāmudra is a result by whatever path you practice to get there. Sure, you can say "This is the road to New York". But being on the road to New York is not being in New York. Likewise, you can say "this is the path of Mahāmudra", meaning that if you practice this path, you will realize the result, mahāmudra.

Mahamudra is taught as ground, path, and fruition. This sort of logic chopping is not helpful to the practitioner.

Nevertheless, if one takes the position, as you have in another thread, that Mahamudra REALLY means the "result," then can it not be said that all practices and techniques are really Mahamudra teachings, in a sense?  Granted, the contents of the teachings contained in the Sutra presentation focus on Mind's Emptiness and Nature, Qualities, Awareness, etc.  But even Serlingpa's Lojong tradition, which is surely a Sutra-based tradition with no Tantric content can be said to be part of the presentation.......

Malcolm wrote:
No, not really, because sutrayāna practice will not result in the realization of the 13th bhumi. The state of mahāmudra and the thirteenth bhumi are synonymous. The name of thirteenth bhumi, much less, mahāmudra, does not exist in sutra and is not really even hinted it.

Malcolm wrote:
Causes and effects are not the same, nor are they different.

The mind that takes rebirth is not as same as the previous mind nor is it different.

This is the reason why it is possible for sentients beings to experience serial rebirth through the appropriation of an infinite series of new physical bodies over time, relatively speaking.

By saying that there is no actual rebirth, one is committing oneself to a metaphysical position called ucchedavada i.e. annihilationism. Commiting oneself to the position that there is an actual self, person, or entity that is reborn is called śāśvatavāda, eternalism.

But when one understands that one instant of mind is neither the same nor different than the next instant of mind; since they are not the same, one avoids śāśvatavāda; and since they are not different, one avoids ucchedavada — thus one can understand the truth of rebirth, karma and its result, and dependent origination in the manner in which the Buddha intended and leave off the metaphysical speculations that plague non-Buddhists about such issues. One can then also understand that since the mind has no beginning, it never arose; and since it never arose, it never ceases.

Pure Mahamudra is free from all these tantric stuff, energy stuff, and free from ceremony etc. In this way, Shikantaza fits properly with pure Mahamudra practice.

Malcolm wrote:
What you are referring to as "pure" mahāmudra is based on a direct introduction as the Dohakosha of Saraha clearly states "The non-dual is demonstrated by the venerable supreme Guru".

In this respect it is nothing like Shikantaza in Soto Zen, since in Soto Zen there is no direct introduction.

The practice of Shikantaza is non-gradual. Sutra mahāmudra is gradual. So they are different in this respect as well.

But then of course we have Dombhi Heruka's Four Syllables:

The Upadeśa of the Great Bliss of Dharma
There are three essences, four commitments, three deviations and four methods of equipoise.

The three essences: 
Effortlessness; 
Without contrivance; 
Everything that occurs is understood as one's own mind. 

The four commitments: 
Afflictions are not abandoned because they are one's mind. 
Antidotes are not relied upon because the mind is non-dual. 
The true nature is not meditated upon because mind is without grasping.
A result is not hoped for, realizing the mind itself is Buddhahood.

The three deviations: 
If there is hope for Buddhahood, it is a deviation.
If there is fear towards Samsara, it is a deviation.
If there is attachment to appearances, it is a deviation.

The four methods of equipoise:
Just like the limpid quality of water when it is undisturbed, remain relaxed in uncontrived mind.
Just as a bird in the sky leaves no tracks, consciousness remains without support.
Just like the sun not concealed by clouds, remain in one’s own unobstructed state relaxing into the objects of the six sense organs.
Just like water always falling, remain undistracted at all times and in all activities.
The heart upadesha of the great master Dombhi Heruka called 'Four Syllables' is complete.

Some people like to talk about a sutra mahāmudra, but it is very clear that was elaborated by Gampopa for people he felt were not ready for real Mahāmudra teachings. Not only have I read this, but this was also kindly explained to me by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyatso personally.

BTW, since this is just the "Mahāmudra" forum -- it is not the sole province of Kagyupas. Sakyas, Gelugs, Nyingmapas also have teachings on Mahāmudra. So in no way can the Kagyu perspective on Mahāmudra be considered definitive or all-embracing -- all schools of Tibetan Buddhism have lineages and teachings on Saraha's original Sahaja Mahāmudra. But only Kagyu and later, Gelug, have teachings on a system termed sutra mahāmudra. Sutra mahāmudra is not bad -- in fact, it is quite a good system -- but in reality it is just a name for perfection of wisdom teachings with some effort made to correlate the view of the tantras and the dohas with the view of sutra.

Funny, this is my translation from which you are quoting.

You are missing a crucial point. This Doha for example, of Virupa is not an expression of mahāmudra as a path. It is an expression of Virupa's realization of the result from following the path of the two stages of creation and completion based on his practice of Nairatmayogini (the consort of Hevajra).
At the end, I just want to say that Mahamudra meditation is a meditation free from visualization, it is a direct path to realize this clear light. Can you see the conflict with Tantra - generation Path, where actually we PURPOSELY do visualization? They are conflicting each other.

Malcolm wrote:
These three mahāmudras are regularly practice by Karma Kagyus without conflict (This elaboration of three mahāmudras is mostly Karma Kagyu approach, BTW, in Drugpa and Drigung, they practice a different system that comes from Phagmo Dru called five-fold mahāmudra). In fact they are considered to be mutually supportive.

But in all of this you are missing one crucial point -- sutra mahāmudra that you cite, according to Kongtrul, is elaborated for those who do not have the capacity to practice the two stages. This meditation is does not rely on mantra and visualization because it is sutra path of the perfection of wisdom.

The middle one, is classical Indian tantric practice of the two stages of creation and completion.

The last, essence mahāmudra, is the mahāmudra which is solely based on a direct introduction and finds its justification in the mahāmudra chapter of the Jñānasiddhi by Indrabodhi. Through this, the disciple realizes the essence of the nature of the mind and remains in that state.

But Darwid, this far, while I have received teaching on Zen, Mahāmudra, and Dzogchen, I am not sure what teachings, if any you are have received from anyone. If you have not received any real teachings on these things, you are like a blind man talking about colors.

In fact, if anything, the Dzogchen you are criticizing is, from a western textual perspective, a bit earlier than Kagyu Mahāmudra. Chetsun Senge Wangchuk achieved rainbow body in 1128, having passed on his teachings to lCegom Nagpo and Shangton, just to put things in perspective. By this time the 17 tantras and the Dzogchen Nyingthig system were fully articulated. Milarepa passed in 1135. Milarepa's teachings became famous, in part, because his student Gampopa spread the fame of his teacher among Kadampas and secured the reputation of the Kagyu school. Nyinthig continued in obscurity in western Tsang largely, I imagine, because it became a family lineage of the lCe clan (Lcegom Nagpo, etc) and the Zhang clan (Zhangton, his son Zhangkhas Nyibum, etc.).

While I am not going to knock the practice the two stages, for me, Dzogchen is more interesting.

Doesn't a statement like this leave the whole deal open to tantras that do not have an Indian origin (or at least a lineage to back them up), like the English language tantra of the Aro mob?

Well, not at all. If a full realized Tibetan produces a tantra, then it should be accepted as a valid teaching -- same goes for a fully realized American, African, European, etc.

Now then, there is certainly good reason to dismiss a "Tibetan" teaching if you find that it does not meet your criteria for a useful teaching.

ince I have no vested interest in harmonizing this or that teaching with some other teaching, I am free to examine each teaching based on its merits and from its terminological perspective.

The fact is that I think that Dzogchen is more interesting than other teachings and more relevant and more profound for a ton of reasons space will not allow me to expand upon.

Jñāna seems to think that just because people use similar terms they must mean the same thing or have the same path. But we know this is a very faulty and problematical perspective. This kind of thinking has lead to reams of improper refutation -- for example, Gelugpas refuting Lamdre and Dzogchen on an equal footing as mind-only school proponents, (not to mention Kagyu Mahāmudra) because both Dzogchen and Lamdre use the term "ālaya" (albeit in different ways)

My sole point which set this off is that the basis discussed in dzogchen and the basis discussed in mahāmudra are not the same since the path is not the same. Is it the case that tregchö  and mahāmudra are very similar? Yes -- but tregchö is not summum bonum of Dzoghen.

But according to Jñāna, we should ignore tögal because, according to him, it and man ngag sde has no "Indian" antecedent (as if that is even important).

It is called the all-basis because when it is not recognized, it is the basis for samsara, and when it is recognized, it is the basis for nirvana.

On the other hand, you have Dzogchen texts that systematically differentiate between gzhi and kun gzhi. The reason for this is not arbitrary and have everything to do with the path of Dzogchen. These topics are not mentioned at all in any system of Mahāmudra since they form no part of Mahāmudra practice.

But it is very hard to date this material. There is also a kama transmission for thögal which is held to date to the 8th century that consists of just a page or two where it forms part of the completion stage of KIlaya/Yangdag.

Anyway, even if man ngag sde did prove to be a later elboration, it does not matter. Jñāna seems to evince a preference for Indian authored material. That's ok, but I do not see Indian authorship as proof of superior content, or Tibetan authorship of inferior content.

According to Khyenste Wangpo, sthāna.


Jnana said:
The basis in mahāmudrā is not limited to compounded, momentary minds. Karmapa Wangchuk Dorje, Mahamudra: The Ocean of Definitive Meaning:
[Ground mahamudra] is what is realized and actualized by the nondual mind of the buddhas and noble individuals. It is the basic state (gshis kyi babs) of the three realms of samsara and the true nature of all phenomena from the beginning. It is connate wisdom (lhan gcig skyes pa'i ye shes), which pervades the entire ground.

Malcolm wrote:
Right, this is not the same thing as the gzhi. Tilopa describes this as the nature of mind:

As such, the nature of the mind resembles space from the beginning,
there are no phenomena not included in it...

This is still the ālaya. As the third Karmapa writes in The Profound Inner Topics:

The cause is the beginningless nature of the mind,
which does not fall into any partialities, 
yet from its unceasing play --
the essence emptiness, and the nature, clarity--
all kinds of aspects arose.

Not recognizing itself, 
the movements of mind’s formations
are like waves moving on water, 
from which object and apprehender both appear,
itself focusing on and apprehending itself;
that mind moves outward; from the apparent aspect
the consciousness that apprehends objects in external objects appears.

This is the ālaya but it is not the gzhi as described by Dzogchen.

The terminology of dzogchen and mahāmudra are not commensurate with each other because the paths are different.

Jnana said:
Neither mahāmudrā nor dzogchen require tögal (cf. all of the dzogchen teachings composed prior to the development of the man ngag sde class).

However things may have been prior to the 11th century, since then tögal is the main thrust of Dzogchen practice. And since this is so, the way the basis is described is different, necessarily so. And so I still do not agree that similarity in terminology indicates similarity in intention.

Another point I want to make is the reason for basis [gzhi] being described the way they are in these two systems as everything to do with their respective paths.

Tregchö is not the path in Dzogchen. It is the ground for practicing the path. The path in Dzogchen is thögal. Hence, the way the basis is explained in Dzogchen reflects the actual path in Dzogchen, thus the explanation of the basis in Dzogchen is completely different than that of Mahāmudra.

A Different basis is elborated because the paths are very different.

The point of tregchö and mahāmudra is basically the same i.e. the instant of unfabricated awareness [ma bcos shes pa skad cig ma]. But in Dzogchen, this only the starting point -- it is not the path, which is why in general, no-one is considered to achieve rainbow body (yes, I know there are some theorectical formulations which might contradict this assertion) only through tregchö.

In other words, you have to accept that Dzogchen terminology is different and has a different intent on the basis of the claim that it is different.

"Natural state" is a translation of a term "gnas lugs", which in turn is a translation of the Sanskrit term "tattva" or bhutatā, both meaning "reality".

That is not true. You are experiening samadhi all the time. Why? Samadhi is a natural function of the mind, called a "mental factor".

The problem is not samadhi, the problem is how to move your mind from its tendency to rest on afflictive objects to path objects.

But rather than worrying about all these contrived meditations it is more more intresting to discover the root of the mind.

Listen -- you will have to forgive us. These endless discussions about rebirth are tiresome. We don't care. Either you accept it or you don't. If you don't fine. But there is no doubt that rebirth was the Buddha's teaching. People who cannot accept that, cannot accept must of the other teachings of the Buddha.

And please spare us the "buddhas teachings were not written down until..."First of all, this is false. Worst case scenario, Buddha's teachings were written down 150 years after his parinirvana (dates of Asokha pillars), which best scholarship places 407-400 BCE. But it is very likely that the earliest sutras were being written down within 50 years.

Mahayana sutras were almost certainly later compositions.

Tantras later than that.

But the one thing all these teachings share is a common thread of rebirth, karma, and dependent origination which are the cause of samsara, and the breaking of rebirth and karma through understanding dependent origination, which gauranteed freedom from rebirth in this or at most seven rebirths.

All those people who think they will attain awakening withotu understanding Buddha's actual teachings on this subject are deluded.

Tibetan meditation runs the gamut from traditional analytic meditation, basically skips over zazen as it is presented in the Japanese and Korean traditions (but possibly not the Chan tradition - I haven't had Chan instruction) and then focuses directly on wisdom or an example wisdom experienced during empowerment.  Practitioners develop familiarity with that wisdom or example wisdom during deity yoga practice where the deity is an example of a fully enlightened Buddha manifesting in some form that can be glossed as highly symbolic.  The peaceful deities in particular are often more accessible as they can often be seen directly by beginners in this tradition as Buddhas and Arya Bodhisattvas.  In fact they are an example of ultimate wisdom manifesting in a relative way through the mind of the practitioner.  So deity yoga samadhi could just be at a mind level for a practitioner and in this sense is no different from zazen samadhi esp. if the practitioner is basically just doing samatha (so shamatha based on a mental image of a deity or on an external physical representation like a statue or a thangka).  However Tibetan Buddhist meditation also directly uses the human energetic body.  This is done in a different way that in yoga and in Taoism and has different results.  Basically the starting point in Tibetan Buddhism is the vision of the Avatamsaka Sutra - they entire universe is a manifestation of the Buddhas and it is our perception that causes beings to experience it as a place of suffering.  Interdependence is mostly but not entirely glossed - it's exposition tends to be muted.

Also, the quote you posted of the Mahatmas regarding Matter would have to be in reference to Mulaprakriti (notice how they are referring to and affirming Parabrahman, etc. as well), not mere "matter" in the 19th century 'scientific' materialistic context.

Moreover, H.P. Blavatsky would have rejected them had they been 19th century 'scientific' materialists, considering that nearly half of the content of her books is dedicated to exposing 19th century 'scientific' materialism as being actually unscientific in many ways (i.e. according to Theosophy, Occult Science is the only true science; whereas materialistic or profane science is limited at best).

Your argument just does not work.

The subfamilly Pemphredoninae also known as the aphid wasps...As with all other sphecoid wasps, the larvae are carnivorous; females hunt for prey on which to lay their eggs, mass provisioning the nest cells with paralyzed, living prey that the larvae feed upon after hatching from the egg.

If someone should argue that buying meat encourages the killing of steer, and so on; is it not also true that buying vegetables encourages the killing of "pests"?

I think that these letters and personal accounts are part and parcel of a wide-spread nineteenth century occult literary culture that had certain norms, conventions, and experiential expectations, fueled by nineteenth century philology, and fueled by a European colonial orientalism, attitudes adopted also by Western Educated Indians.

I regard these accounts at worst delusions, and at best, fantasy writing. But I cannot take them seriously.

Maybe we can shift the grounds of these arguments, since I don't see any agreements coming anytime soon. While slogging through five pages of this stuff, I could not help but wonder, since when is it Buddhist practise to correct someone over and over again, when they have made it patently clear they are not interested in the advice offered? Now, I can see it being encouraged in evangelical Christianity, or in Maoist-era "education" sessions, but in Buddhism?

It is hard to see that any good is being done by pursuing the topic. Everyone is talking, no one is changing their point of view, and animosity is encouraged. If pursued to a logical end, the arguments will not lead to resolution, but to the creation of a vegan sect, a vegetarian sect, an ovolactarian sect and so on.

Malcolm wrote:
This already exists.

My personal opinion is that the Vegetarianism in Mahāyāna sutras and lower tantra is largely a product of a cultural response and an appeal to dietary trends in Indian culture, and need not be taken as "gospel". They are not definitive teachings.

Thervadins, Japanese Buddhists and Tibetan Buddhists by a large eat meat.

Chinese Buddhists do not.

Many Tibetan Buddhists feel bad about it, because they also follow Mahāyāna; but because Anuttarayoga tantra is more important, they eat meat.

Chinese Buddhists are very shrill and agressive about not eating meat and many Tibetan Lamas with lots of Chinese students have succumbed to pressure not to eat meat (which is undoubtedly better for their health).

In the US, there is trend for yoga practicing Buddhists to eschew eating meat. Also amongst some younger Tibetan Buddhists there is a trend to stop eating meat -- which is ironic, because virtually all instructions of yantra and tummo recommend that one eat some meat, especially lamb and yak, which are quite warming.

There are lamas like the Karmapa and Chatral Rinpoche, that advise everyone to stop eating meat. Then there are Lamas like Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, who advise everyone to eat meat.

I also have gone through periods of revulsion towards meat. But in the end, my conclusion is that diet is mainly important for maintaining one's health. Therefore, one should eat whatever is best for one's health, and that is a state that changes with age, with the seasons, and with illness.

supply and demand, oldest con in the book.


Malcolm wrote:
Peak oil is a very misunderstood term. Peak oil refers not to the total amount of oil in the ground, rather it refers to the total amount of _easily recoverable oil_(or any other mineral resource).

There is a relationship between the high price of oil and drilling for oil in places where it expensive to recover, or the cost of extracting it (think shale oil and hydro fraking (which is not just about gas)) is very high.

When the price of oil rises too high however, it triggers recession, demand drops off, prices decline, and it becomes too pricey to drill for oil in exotic places (like the deep gulf).

Basically, what peak oil is really about is the energy return on energy investment (EROI). In 19th century, the ratio was roughly 50 to one i.e. for barrel of oil or equivalent amount of energy, one could recover fifty barrels of oil. Presently, the EROI is between one to five barrels of for each BOE invested.

What peak oil theory is actually about is not the actual amount of oil that exists in the ground, it is a critique of the economic feasability of extracting oil from ever more difficult places to reach it.

Hubbert's basic contention is sound:

"Our principal constraints are cultural. During the last two centuries we have known nothing but exponential growth and in parallel we have evolved what amounts to an exponential-growth culture, a culture so heavily dependent upon the continuance of exponential growth for its stability that it is incapable of reckoning with problems of nongrowth."

When EROI drops below one BOE, it becomes very unfeasible to invest in any new petroleum recovery. That is what peak oil is actually about. When it is no longer profitable for oil companies to recover oil, then all the dominos begin to fall...

The demand for meat is not actually tied to its production. Meat is provided to the market in large quanities which outstrip actual demand so that it is always available.

Your defence of meat eating is disappointing given that some years ago on eSangha you were advocating vegetarianism and calling meat eating sinful.

Malcolm wrote:
Yes, this is true. I still advocate vegtarianism (primarily for reasons of health). Meat eating as done by ordinary persons is a bit sinful.

But I was addressing the argument that being a vegetarian is less harmful (it isn't) to living beings and the contention that practitioners who eat meat are not assisting the unfortunate sentient being who lands on their plate, as well as the contention that eating meat ipso facto makes one culpable in the act of killing (rejected by Bhavaviveka and also by me).

If you recall, on E-Sangha, I asserted that eating meat for one's health was acceptable, and that following the protocol of the ganapuja was not negotiable, at least not for me.

I am not so much defending the eating of meat as I am pointing out the error of "the compassionate vegetarian" argument -- it is total bollocks.

Everyone who gardens does so with full knowledge they are harming living beings. The same is true of farmers -- killing is still killing whether motivated by malice, craving or ignorance. If you are arguing that meat eaters participate necessarily in the intent to kill; then so do vegetarians. Why? Because it is impossible to eat any food during the production of which no sentient being was harmed. When an organic farmer applies an organic pesticide to save his or her crop from an aphid infestation, this is no less a deliberate act of killing than leading cattle, pigs or fowl to a slaughter house.

You are not saving a single animal from a miserable death by being a vegetarian. If you think so, you are kidding yourself or living in a fantasy.

There are, in breif, two points, arguments ChNN makes, with which I am sure you are familiar:

One, the production of vegetables, grains, fruit and so on is not free from harming creatures, whether organic or conventonally produced. Thus the belief that one is being less harmful to living beings by being a vegetarian is a mistaken delusion.

gad rgyangs said:
this has already been easily defeated on the grounds that there is no intent to kill sentient beings in vegetable farming, indeed the intent can be to try and minimize it as much as possible.

Malcolm wrote:
Everyone who gardens does so with full knowledge they are harming living beings. The same is true of farmers -- killing is still killing whether motivated by malice, craving or ignorance. If you are arguing that meat eaters participate necessarily in the intent to kill; then so do vegetarians. Why? Because it is impossible to eat any food during the production of which no sentient being was harmed. When an organic farmer applies an organic pesticide to save his or her crop from an aphid infestation, this is no less a deliberate act of killing than leading cattle, pigs or fowl to a slaughter house.

gad rgyangs said:
On the other hand, the whole point of the exercise in meat eating depends on deliberately killing sentient beings.

Malcolm wrote:
Not at all, if your argument is intent, merley consuming meat does not equate with the intent to kill sentient beings. That only follows if one slays or requests the slaughter, of a given sentient being. Purchasing meat does not satisify this criteria.

Your argument is actually the specious one, rejected quite thoroughly by Bhavaviveka. If one does not kill an animal, request it's death, or see it being killed, since there is no consciousness in the flesh of dead animal, there is no karmic consequence to eating meat. Nor is there any reasonable moral reason not to eat such meat. The only reason not to eat meat under these circumstances is aesthetic choice.



gad rgyangs said:
so should we encourage butchers to kill animals..

Malcolm wrote:
Encouraging the slaughter of animals would be be to engage in killing. This is forbidden. But eating meat that one has not killed, requested the slaughter of or seen slaughtered bears no fault. And, if one is a practitioner, the consumption of such meat has an added benefit of creating a positive cause for that animal.

Malcolm wrote:
Whether you buy meat or not, the abbatoirs will still keep churning out carcasses. Not buying meat does not prevent killing.

Buying it does not increase the level of killing. The meat industry has targets set for how many animals they must kill in order to keep meat fresh in markets, and it bears no relationship, at this point economic history, with actual demand in the marketplace. Far more meat is discarded everyday than is purchased from markets.

Second, when a practitioner consume the flesh of animals who have been killed it creates a cause for that animal to meet the teachings. Indeed, it is held that the animal accrues merit because it's body contributes to the well-being of a practitioner. Eschewing such food lacks compassion since no connection is made with said animal.

Therefore, ChNN desribes vegetarianism based on the idea that one is being more compassionate and less harmful to sentient beings as a form of "miserable compassion" -- his words, not mine -- wholly divorced from reality.

This is what I do not accept. I know many Americans, the vast majority of them are not arrogant and do not think they are better than anyone else.

If nationalism is a fault, it applies to all -- including, and especially Tibetans.

The western Buddhists I know respect sublime persons and they do beleive in teachers.

If we are not understanding some teaching deeply, that is the fualt of the teachers. But the way many Tibetans want it, is that one should have total faith before receiving teachings. This will not work in the West. And this was also not Buddha's intention.

So I find myself in disagreement with this point of view.

I also do not accept the blanket condemnation that almost all Western teachers of Buddhism are nihilists.

wisdom, not conceptuality.

Again, the ultimate authority is personal experience.

In terms of what I offered you, since it is hard to understand the sutras and tantras, you need to rely on oral instruction. In order to rely on oral instruction, you need a teacher. But in order to confirm the teacher's instruction is correct, you need your experience of the path. So again, in the end, experience is the final authority in dharma.

Bodhicitta has many levels. The highest is "I will enlighten all beings" without any consideration of whether or not one is a Buddha beforehand. If one can't honestly cultivate this level of Bodhicitta one should still want to, and hope for a time when they have the resolve to do so.

Bodhicitta should be aroused before hearing, reading, practicing or teaching Dharma. Equally important is dedicating the merit accumulated from these actions (even reading WOMPT). In reference to why we dedicate merit and what happens if we do not, 'The Way of the Bodhisattva' says:

"All the good works gathered in a thousand ages,
Such as deeds of generosity,
And offerings to the Blissful Ones—
A single flash of anger shatters them."

And in regards to this passage, Dudjom Rinpoche states-

"It only takes a single cause for exhausting merit—a surge of intense anger directed toward a special object, or similarly a wrong view—for one’s store of virtuous deeds to be depleted. But by dedicating them to enlightenment, they will never be exhausted but grow greater and greater."

So basically even the highest Bodhicitta aspiration will come to nothing without dedication.

Nope. The Sakya school, for example, teaches four authorities: text, oral instruction, guru, and experience.

Of those four, it is only the last that confirms the first three as authoritative. This is why the buddha instructs us that he cannot remove our suffering, or hand us liberation, but only show us the path.

And for that reason, I instruct my students to rely on their experience rather than some words in a book. Why, because I am a practitioner who has  confirmed the truth of the essence of the dharma in my own experience, and that was not based on some words in a book.

Sutras and tantras are secondary to personal experience. This is why a Buddhism fundamentalism is impossible. We can certainly use sutras to illustrate our points, but there is no settled 'canon". Gzhan stong pas have their scriptures, Gelugs have theirs, Zen has another canon; Theravada theirs, etc.

rai said:
regarding the Long Life practices and rites i was wondering

is the life force the same as "life sustaining wind"? then how is it possible that we can restore or gather the life force (which is something physical) just by chanting or visualization?

wouldn't it have more sense to do some yoga and improve our diet instead of doing long life practices?


Malcolm wrote:
Good question.


Life force i.e. srog or jiv is connected with our tshe or ayus. Ayus refers to longevity, and to have a long life, we need to reinforce our jiv, our life force.

The reason we use an arrow during long life rites is that it is a symbol of the karmically projected span of our life i.e. in Abhidharma is states that longevity is like an arrow shot from a bow; and when the force impelling the arrow is exhausted, the arrow falls to the ground.

Now the principle of longevity is based on three factors: merit, karma, and life force itself. If you exhaust your merit you will die. If you meet with karmic circumstances, you will die. If you exhaust your lifeforce, you will die.

One's merit is a factor in one's longevity, and so therefore, when one's longevity is threatened, merit-making activities can reinforce it, thus practice. This can also theoretically delay a karmic disease and so on. Also since one's life force is physical, yoga, praṇayāma, diet, and so on can reinforce it.

To answer your first question -- no, Jiv is not the same thing as praṇā vāyu; however, without breathing you will quikly die, and so respiration is called "life sustaining" vāyu or wind. Jiv is assciated with the heat of the body. When you cease breathing, your body slowly loses its heat which is the sign that you have lost your life and your life force is gone. Actually, your body starts losing its heat even before you die, and coldness in the extremities is a sign of death. You can read about signs of death, both distant and near in texts on the bardo as well as in the chapter on the signs of death in the translations of the medicine tantra.

N

Almost all major cycles of long-life practice have praṇāyāma, rasāyāna and dietary recommendations, and all systems of yoga are oriented towards disease prevention and life-extension. So long life practices are a perfect combination of religious practice, yoga and diet which serve to extend life.

Most Tibetan Buddhists I know take zero interest in things outside TB. They might be Gelug-pa and while Nyingma or Kagyu practices and teachings might be absorbed, they'd never think to go study under a Chan teacher. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, and I believe people should do what they feel appropriate given their karmic circumstances. Still, Buddhism underwent a massive holocaust in the last century (in the 19th century Buddhism was probably the largest religion in the world), and unity and fellowship is, in my mind, important to cultivate.

I suppose, though, it depends not so much on institutions, but people's karmic propensities and relations. Some feel great connection to Theravada and nothing else, others feel a connection only to TB and little else.

Malcolm wrote:
Once you have settled on whatever practice you are interested in, there is not much point, apart from academic interest, in pursuing other school's teachings.

Also there is a question of terminology and hermenuetics -- Sino-Japanese hermeneutics are not compatible to a large degree with Indo-Tibetan hermeneutics -- their interpretive criteria are simply too different to make comparisons meaningful. For example, take the perennial debate about Chan in Tibetan Buddhism. Anyone who has studied Dzogchen deeply knows that Dzogchen and Chan are not related. But for all of that, there is superficial rhetoric that causes people to consistently conflate the two.

Also the deep differences between Tibetan Buddhism and Sino-Japanese Buddhism sometimes render influences of one upon the other hard to see, for example, underlying current of debt Kagyu Mahāmudra systems own to Chan Buddhism via such texts as the Vajrasamadhi sutra. It is also a contention of certain Tibetan scholars that Chan is influenced by Dzogchen (via Tun Huang).

Whatever the case may be, what we usually observe is people moving through schools and practices until they find people they like and with whom they feel comfortable. I know many people who like Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche's teachings, but do not feel welcome in Dzogchen Community, and so they do not stay -- the DC simple does not address their emotional and social needs. And these two latter factors, the meeting of emotional and social needs, I would argue, are far more important than doctrine in terms of why people select the practices and lineages they do, over all.

One main difference between for example the Śuddhavasas, the realms of non-returners, and Sukhavati, is that one can take rebirth here or elsewhere.

actually not quite in the majjhima nikaya(i used to be thervadan before i became mayahana) the pure abodes is a realm of gods JUST like amitayus pureland(we are reborn as gods in amitayus pureland as his vow we will all receive vajra god bodies)

in sources i posted in the pali in samsarasan we will be reborn in either hell,ghosts,animnals,human,gods these are the realms of samsdara the PUREABODES is seperated from the 5 transmigations and is given its own realm (strictly for Buddhists with faith)(the desrtuction of the fetter of DOUBT)(true faith)

the pure abodes is a palce of non-retrogression just like mahayana pureland it is a place where you go and are NEVER reborn back to samsara it is a resting place for people tilll they become enlightened there.

the other source i gave you was of a laity man who died (killed by a cow) and was reborn in the pure abodes to stay till he became a Buddha.

the pureland and pureabodes is the same thing (abodes) TRANSLATES to (land) from sanscrit to the chinese launguge(pureland/pureabodes)
so the pureland can be found in the pali canon in every single nikaya the only thing that is different is the 5 fetters must be desroyed and the mahayana warns of the 5 burnings (same things) the amitayaus pureland is easier to get into.

so the foundation of pureland can be found in all Buddhist suttas/sutras

In other words, since this type of hierchical approach to Buddhist teachings exist in Tibetan Buddhism from the start, it is better to just be open about it.

Now, you personally may not buy into it, but since the nine yānas hierarchy is there, and since it is embedded into our tradtion, it is a little too much to insist that people not speak from the point of view of the teachings they follow.

The reality is that people wind up with the practice and teachers they have a connection with and no other.

gregkavarnos said:
Yes, just that the standard remark is derogatory, since the standard is not exactly a standard, but a particular subjective view of the relationship of the nine yana to the two accumulations.  One that sets a hierarchy of capacity and ability.


Malcolm wrote:
Greg:

The nine yānas sets out a heirarchy of capacity and ability. That is the whole point of the system -- to grade various Buddhist practices in a hierarchy.

They are not arbitrary assignations, incidentally, but assignations found in the tantras.

If you want to consider the Nyingma system derogatory, please go ahead by all means. And yes, Vipassana, Madhyamaka, Zen, Pure Land, Kriya Tantra, Yoga Tantra and so on all find their place within the nine yānas somewhere, and of course, none of them are at the head of it.

Since for Tsongkhapa the ultimate truth and conventional truth are two different aspects (conceptual identities)  of one ontological entity why should this follow?  Just because we see one aspect of an entity why should it follow that we perceive all the other aspects?

I would have expected instead the critique that this position holds emptiness as not beyond existence and non-existence, but as existent.

But false perception is mthong brdzun, so what Candrakirti is clearly saying is that false/faulty/incorrect perception is relative, or totally obscuring, truth.

seems like this blockhead understanding of Chandra leads to the following idea:

Namdrol said:
The two truths are about how objects are perceived. They can be perceived in only two ways, correctly and incorrectly. Perceiving them incorrectly, a false perception of them is called relative truth. The word brdzun pa means "to lie" as well.

5heaps said:
for in gelugpa the two truths are divisions of reality. what do you think about the two truths being 1 entity? for me it seems super air-tight so it would be good if you could find a sharp barb to sink in!


Malcolm wrote:
If the two truths are one entity, seeing relatives truth would be seeing ultimate truth and all commoners would always have correct perception.

only if its a bad translation, or if the word in untranslatable, in which case it is usually left in the source language.

Malcolm wrote:
Not true. This is why the explanation of any translated Dharma text requires special skills.

One has to strike a balance between readability and over-glossing a term. In many cases, it is better to select a simple translation that indicates to the explainer a broader range of meaning, which then can act as a hook to remind the person who has received the explanation of the text in question of the broader explanation.

Take a term like mngon sum. It means completely different things depending on how it is used -- but in general, always refers to actually witnessing an event. Sometimes, as in logic, direct perception is better. Sometimes, like when discussing a visionary experience, "personally saw guru rinpoche" meaning that Guru P actually showed up and you saw him in person, as opposed to a dream. Or in Dzogchen, when discussing the first of the four visions, here it means having a personal experience of vidyā as a visual phenomena, seeing a thigle.

In the latter case, if you translate chose nyid mgon sum as direct perception of dharmatā, someone who has no idea about Dzogchen will understand this to be a reference the path of seeing (which it is not).  For that matter, even the meaning of dharmatā is different, which is why in so many dzogchen texts, when discussing dharmatā ala sutra style, the term stong pa nyid is always appended i.e. chos nyid stung pa nyid, to make the distinction between dharmatā as ye shes or rig pa in the visions.

Ideally of course you would want everything to be easily understood, but in practice this is far more difficult than you imagine. Something simple have to be explained beyond the translation equivalent you select.

Anyone who really understands how rang byung is being used in these texts would read it that way. rang byung ye shes is so called because it does not arise from other than one's own experience, it is not given to you, it does not arise from someone's instruction, etc. It is the wisdom that comes from within oneself.

also, isn't saying "the wisdom that arises from oneself/one's self" problematic because A) surely it doesn't arise from the conventional self, and what other kind of self is there? and B) the whole point of rang byung is it is arisen without causes or conditions, and your rendering is in an "A arises from B" format.

When you have read sufficient amount of texts this will be more clear to you. For now, just go with the conventional reading.

you said earlier:
at the time vāyu stirred in the basis, the three wisdoms were not recognized
wisdoms = ye shes? If ye shes/rig pa is a "knowingness", then who or what did or didn't recognize them?

Malcolm wrote:
Wisdom = ye shes.

This is a subtle point of Dzogchen most people do not pay attention to. There is very little difference between Dzogchen cosmology and Abhidharma cosmology. But there is a slight difference. In Dzogchen cosmology all sentient beings achieve buddhahood.

But....there are two kinds of buddhahood discussed in Dzogchen; buddhahood that reverts to the cause and the buddhahood that does not revert the cause.

Those whose buddhahood was incomplete can still fall into sentient being hood if they do not recognize the arising of the basis as being their own display.

According to the commentary on the སྲས་གཅིག་པུ་རྒྱུད by Garab Dorje in the Vima Nyinthig, the basis arises because of traces of latent affliction and action left over from the previous eon. At that time, one either recognizes the stirring of the basis or not.
