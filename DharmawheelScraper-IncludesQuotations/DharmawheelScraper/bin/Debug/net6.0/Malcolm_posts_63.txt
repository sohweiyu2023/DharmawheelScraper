Well, what I am is a follower of Buddhadharma. One of the reasons that I eschew the label "Buddhist" for myself is that I am not any particular kind of Buddhist. The term "Buddhist" in many ways is too limiting. I have met "Buddhists" who imagine that because they are Buddhists they cannot take teachings from teachers in other streams of Dharma outside Buddhadharma. I personally have no problem with it. That is why I follow Dharma, and Buddhadharma in particular. All Dharma religions, incidentally, accept rebirth.

However, I have also found that conventionally, it is easier to resort to the term Buddhism and Buddhist in common conversations with others.

I am somewhat confused with this idea of reaching Buddhahood in this very lifetime: I've learned that part of Vajrayana is taking the Bodhisattva vows, where we pledge to *not* take up Buddhahood asap but to postpone it until all beings all liberated. If this is so, how does it fit in with the fast path to Buddhahood? Or is it the case that Vajrayana is not always a Bodhisatva-based approach?



Malcolm wrote:
There are three different types of bodhisattva vows: like a king, like a captain, and like a shepherd.

The king-like bodhisattva vow involves the wish to achieve buddhahood as soon as possible, in order to guide others to that state, like a king ruling a country.
The captain-like bodhisattva vow involves the wish to achieve buddhahood at the same time as all other sentient beings, like a captain arriving in port at the same time as his passengers.
The shepherd-like bodhisattva vow involves attaining buddhahood only after all sentient beings have attained buddhahood, like a shepherd who only rests after his flock is safely penned for the night.

Vajrayāna uses the first of these. In other words, our bodhisattva vow states " May I attain the state of Buddhahood in order to place all other sentient beings in that state."

Malcolm wrote:
Here is a random sampling, running a quick word search on the pdf you provided from Shasta Abbey. From these samplings you can Dogen was a follower of Mainstream Buddhism, and took the idea of rebirth quite literally.

The kesa, from ancient times, has been called ‘the garment of liberation’, for
it can free us from all our obstructions, be they from the karmic* effects of our past
deeds, from our defiling passions, or from the effects of our rebirth in one of the
six worlds* of existence.


What we call the three temporal periods are the three time periods in which
we receive the retribution from our good and evil acts. These are, first, the
retribution experienced in one’s present life; second, the retribution experienced in
one’s next life; and third, the retribution experienced in some later future life.
Through your practice of the Way of the Buddhas and Ancestors you learn, first
off, to clarify what the principle of karmic retribution in these three time periods is.
If you do not do so, you will make many errors and fall into false views. You will
not just fall into false views, you will also give rise to evil ways and undergo
suffering for a long time. By failing to continue developing your good roots, you
will lose much spiritual merit and will have long-standing obstructions on your
path to enlightenment.
The karmic retribution experienced in these three temporal periods comes
from both good and evil acts.

Right view is a gate to what the Dharma illumines, for by
means of it we can realize the Saintly Path and
exhaust the stream of rebirths.
Right thought is a gate to what the Dharma illumines, for
by means of it we eliminate all discriminatory
judgments, as well as any lack of discernment.
Right speech is a gate to what the Dharma illumines, for
by means of it we will recognize that all names,
voicings, and words are simply like vibrations.
Right livelihood is a gate to what the Dharma illumines,
for by means of it we rid ourselves of all our evil
ways.
Right action is a gate to what the Dharma illumines, for
by means of it we arrive at the Other Shore.
Right mindfulness is a gate to what the Dharma
illumines, for by means of it we do not
intellectualize all thoughts and things.
Right concentration is a gate to what the Dharma
illumines, for by means of it we can attain the
meditative state that is beyond scattered thoughts.

It is clear that the desire to be reborn within the human world is something longed
for even by a Lord Yama. Once someone has been reborn as a human being, he or
she should forthwith have their head shaved, don the kesa of the Three Treasures,
and take up the study of the Way of the Buddha. These are the merits of being
within the world of humans, which surpasses the other five worlds of existence.
But to be born in the human world and then to wantonly seek out the path to
political power or some other worldly career, vainly spending one’s life as a toady
to ministers and kings, wrapping oneself up in fantasies and dreams, only to
proceed in later times towards pitch darkness without anything to rely upon, that is
folly indeed! Not only have you received the body of a human being, which is hard
to come by, but you have also encountered the Buddha Dharma, which is hard to
encounter. You should forthwith cast aside all your involvements and quickly leave
home life behind in order to study the Way. Rulers and ministers, along with their
wives and children, their relatives and households, are encountered everywhere,
but the Buddha Dharma, like the rare udumbara blossom, is hard to meet up with.
In short, when impermanence suddenly arrives, there is no ruler or minister, friend
or relative, spouse or child, or any precious treasure that will save us, for each of us
simply returns to death’s Yellow Spring alone.24 What follows along with us is
simply our good and bad karma. When we are about to lose our human body, our
feelings of regret for our human body may well be deep indeed! So, while we still
have our human body, we should quickly leave home life behind. Just this alone
will be the true Teaching of the Buddhas of the three temporal worlds.

When all bodhisattvas who are bound to be reborn one final time are
about to descend from the Tushita Heaven to be born in the land of Jambudvipa,*
they invariably proclaim the one hundred and eight gates to what the Dharma
illumines for the sake of the celestial multitudes in the Tushita Heaven, and thereby
pass on the Teaching to those celestial ones, for this is the invariable method of
Buddhas.

After darkness has come before our eyes, we should, right off, strive to recite
the Three Refuges, not shirking from this even during our entering the intermediate
world or our next birth. In this way, we should thoroughly expend life after life
and, in age after age, reverently recite Them.

Once you have given rise to the intention to seek enlightenment, even
though you are spinning about through the six worlds* of existence, being born
through any of the four modes of birth, the very causes and conditions of your
spinning will become your heartfelt practice of enlightenment.

We do not know how many rounds of birth and death we have already spent
returning again and again to various useless delusions, even while possessing this
wisdom. It is like rocks covering up a jewel: the jewel is unaware that it is covered
up by rocks and the rocks are unaware that they are covering up a jewel. When
human beings recognize this jewel, they seize upon it. This is not something that
the jewel expectantly awaits nor is it something that the rocks have been waiting
for, and it does not depend on a spiritual awakening on the part of the rocks nor is
it something that the jewel thinks about. That is to say, even though a human being
and wisdom are unaware of each other, the Way is invariably overheard by the
person’s wisdom.

Fundamentally, speaking, according to Vajrayāna texts, the extraordinary difference in time is due to the fact that Vajrayāna pratices uses the body as the vehicle for liberation, as well as other special methods, that allow a very serious practitioner to gather the two accumulations that normally require three eons in a single lifetime.

pensum said:
However, Dogen's views on life and death are somewhat more nuanced than that found in typical discussions of "literal rebirth"; to wit, this excerpt from the Bendowa, the first chapter of Dogen's Shobogenzo: Question: Someone has said, "Do not reject life and death. There is an
easy shortcut to freedom from life and death. This is knowing that the
essence of the mind is eternal. This means that although this body is born
and inevitably progresses towards death, this mental essence does not
perish. If you understand that this mental essence that is not subject to
arising and ceasing resides in my body is the original mental essence; and
so, while the body takes a temporal form but is always inconstant, born here
and dying there, this mental essence is eternal and does not change in past,
present, and future. To know this is to be free from birth and death. For
those who know this, the birth and death they have known up to now vanish,
and they enter into an ocean of the mental essence. Entering this ocean,
they have wonderous virtues like the Buddhas and Tathagatas. Even if you
know this now, because your body is the result of former delusive actions,
you differ from the sages. Those who do not know this principle turn in the
cycle of life and death eternally. So you only need to know this principle of
the eternal mental essence. If you sit in vain you waste your whole life. What
can you possibly hope for?"
Does this view conform to the Way of the Buddhas and Ancestors?
Answer: This view is not the Buddha Dharma at all. It is the Senika view
which is skewed outside of the Way. This skewed view says: "In our body
there is a ghostly intelligence and it is through this that, as conditions
occur, we have the capacity to distinguish between like and dislike, right
and wrong, pain and stimulation, and suffering and pleasure. When the body
dies, this ghostly intelligence is released from here and is born some place
else. Therefore, though it seems to die here, it is born there, it is immortal
and eternal." This is that view skewed outside the Way.
If you learn about this and think it is the Buddha Dharma, it is sillier
than holding a tile or pebble and thinking it to be golden treasure. This
foolishness is beyond anything to compare it to and is an embarrassment.
The National Master Huizhong of Tang China strongly warned against this view.
Those who hold this delusive view think that "the mind is eternal and
that appearance is transitory" and equate this with the wonderous Dharma
of the Buddhas and think that they have broken free from life and death; but
this is the original cause of life and death. Isn't this shamefully silly? This
is nothing but a deluded view skewed outside of the Way. Don't let your ears
touch it.
Still, I need to address this issue, and so I will now rectify this
delusion out of compassion. Understand that in the Buddha Dharma body
and mind are single; nature and form are spoken of as not-two. This is
known throughout both the Western heavens and Eastern lands and is
beyond any doubt. In a school that talks about eternity, the myriad things
are all eternal and body and mind is undivided. In a school that talks about
cessation, all things are ceasing and nature and form are not divided.
How can you say that the body ceases while the mind is eternal in
contradiction to this true principle? You must further realize that life and
death itself is nirvana. We cannot talk about nirvana without life and death.
It is wrong to think that the view that "the mind becomes eternal when it is
free from the body" is the Buddha’s wisdom that is free from life and death,
when the mind that thinks this is itself arising and ceasing and is not
eternal. Could this be relied upon? Understand thoroughly that the
singleness of body and mind is always upheld in the Buddha Dharma. And
so, how could the mind go off from the body to be eternal when the body
arises and perishes? If you say that body and mind are sometimes one and
sometimes not, this would mean you are saying that the Buddha's words are
false. To think that birth and death can be avoided is guilty of despising the
Buddha Dharma. Caution is needed here.
The Buddha Dharma, especially the Lineage that speaks of "the
Dharma Gate of the totality of the nature of Awareness as the vast array"
of the total world of events and experiences does not divide suchness from
appearance, nor arising from vanishing. Even bodhi and nirvana are
nothing but this nature of Awareness. All things and appearances without
exception are totally and only this single Awareness and are embraced
without disarray. The various Dharma Gates are all equally this single
Awareness. This is how the nature of mind is understood in the Buddha
Dharma. How can you divide this into body and mind or life and death from
nirvana? You are already a child of the Buddha so do not listen to madmen
who preach views that are skewed outside of the Way.

"The consciousness of the memory is not different than the consciousness (experiencing the object) by which an object is experienced, as has already been explained. Why? Because the memory isn't a different thing. Since there was an experience, the memory arises with the object since the consciousness recalling that experience is not different than the experience. Since whatever is encompassed by the consciousness of the experience is encompassed by the consciousness of the memory, it is said "I saw". This is also a worldly convention and is not something to examine, since it is worldly convention of those who possess deluded objects."

Khenpo Palden Sherab was an awesome lama, someone for whom I have great respect, but nothing you are saying is really brand new to me. Each teaching has its specific context. You cannot expect people who are not Vajrayāna practitioners, for example, to cultivate pure vision in the Vajrayāna sense of the word because they have not been ripened by empowerment nor granted liberating instructions.

Karma is always taught subsequent to dependent origination, for while dependent origination explains the how and why of being reborn; karma explains the what and where of being reborn.

It is fine to say this is all an illusion, a mirage, its unreal, and so on. But it is also necessary to recognize, such as you do, then we need to deal with all these unreal conditions like illness, floods, death, meals, sleeping, waking and so on, and we have to bear in mind that we generally deal with them, 99.999 percent of the time as if they are real. For example, if you are shot, you not sit on your cushion reciting mantras, telling yourself that it is all unreal and it will go away. Not only does one's own karmic traces have the ability to generate appearances for oneself, but also the karmic traces of others can do so as well, as Shabkar points out in Flight of the Garuda. Given this situation, we have to be practical and understand and remind ourselves that having a profound view and realizing it are totally different.

Malcolm wrote:
Hogwash. This is your weak argument. The Buddha's essential message is entirely consistent through Mainstream Buddhism, Mahāyāna and all Vajrayāna teachings including Dzogchen. Beings take continual rebirth samsara, dying here, reappearing there for as long as they are under the control of the three afflictions produced by self-grasping. When that self-grasping is eradicated, beings stop taking birth in beginningless samsara. Dependent origination exists solely for the purpose of explaining that process and how to end that process. It is not, as it is commonly misapplied today, to be taken as a general commentary on external phenomena such as the formation of galaxies and so on, though it can of course be applied to such external phenomena as well. The primary reason Buddha taught dependent origination was so that people would stop asking him who they were in past lives. So his reply is fundamentally: our origin is rooted in affliction, which is the cause of karma, and karma is the cause of suffering. When we remove those afflictions, we cease creating karmas, the cause of suffering. This process occurs for living beings from beginningless time.  All valid Buddhist traditions accept this. This is the Dharma of the Buddha we are taking refuge in. If someone does not accept this, they are not really taking refuge in the Dharma, I am sorry to say.

This kind of thing can happen even in a very traditinal setting. I feel by me sharing this I am able to let a bit off my chest so to speak, since I was in the retreat. As well just put it out there that a long term retreat is a serious decesion and when entering one you really have to be a very stable person all ready ( that should be obvious but it shocking how it is not )

...

These things need serious reflection before entering. They need concerned, compassionat, caring helpers and assistants along the way. And they need reality checks when things flare up. Maybe for at least the lay practioners a mental health screening would have been helpful in my situation! There is so much shit that comes up being alone with one self, as Malcom pointed out with the axe example!

Reintegrating after that much time is diffiuclt. Reinegrating after psychological dissapointments is even more challenging. Not letting your “spiritual” world get complely crushed and being able to maintain the veiw though out insance circumstances is greater still.

Anyhow, sorry if there was not much point in all that, I just wanted to share and say it can happen anywhere, even in a seemingly perfect traditional situation.

Sharp weapons are generally not permitted within a retreat precinct because things like the following happen: when my teacher, Ngagpa Yeshe Dorje, was nearly done with his first three year retreat, he had what is called a "chod nyams", a chod experience where he saw his leg as a huge side of meat. So he took a knife he had brought with him into the retreat, and cut a huge chunk of his leg out for his ganapuja. The next morning his attendant found him lying in a pool of blood, nearly dead. His retreat master told him that he could not leave, but anyhow they brought a doctor, patched up his leg, and he remained in the retreat. Now, you have to understand that the Throma retreat manual specifically forbids bringing anything sharp with you into the retreat.

My point is that retreats are serious business and a lot of things can go wrong, and do go wrong. Luckily my experience was pretty peaceful, but then I did my retreat alone without companions, so it was not complicated by the presence of others.

I don't think any knowledgable person here imagines that what happened at DM is impossible in other situations. I remember hearing that in one three year retreat in the US, a very disturbed woman tried to burn down the house the the retreat was being held in, back in the '80's.

Buddhist logic only works if you accept the parameters of Buddhist logic. I think you need to study Dignaga and Dharmakirti a little more thoroughly before you can say you were using "Buddhist" logic to question a Buddhist tenet.

So what are the parameters of Buddhist logic, or "pramāṇa"? They are that there are three valid forms of authority: direct perception, inference, and testimony of special witnesses, such as the Buddha.

Dharmakirti's entire project is to prove that Buddha is a special witness, without recourse to sūtras and so on. If one can show that indeed the Buddha is a special witness, then it follows that one can heed what the Buddha says without reservation. You should get Jackson's book "Is Enlightenment Possible" which deals with this very issue, and includes a logical defense of rebirth.

Personally, I don't fig "Dharma Lite" much, and I think the Buddhist worldview with Karma and Rebirth removed turns nonsensical for the most part..however I don't think believing this way makes someone "not a Buddhist" at all - we should respect people's evolution somewhat I think - as SMCJ says . Wherever I might want to pick apart their worldview, I have "secular Buddhist" friends who certainly walk the walk in the way the live, and have been greatly helped by their "incomplete" version of Dharma.

On the other hand, I DO question materialist-leaners who spend  a lot of effort trying to prove the Buddha did actually mean what he said..and I assume that is maybe part of the tension in this thread, and with this subject in general, which let's face it..is ubiquitous.

Malcolm wrote:
One thing that there can be no doubt about; people who are interested in Buddhism often cannot reconcile the ideological underpinnings of logical positivism, the bedrock of scientism, with Dharma. That is the point. Therefore, they seek to discard keystone Dharma tenets which they feel are not relevant to them (Andrew108 illustrates this for us perfectly), whilst maintaining whatever they are interested in: meditation, etc. They seem not to understand that Dharma is not a pick and choose sort of thing. It is not a supermarket of ideas in which one can shop and take home and create one's own recipe.

That passage I quoted from the Kalama Sutta, is also elaborated in the Samaññaphala Sutta, which deals with the 'fruits of the contemplative life visible in the here-and-now'.

I am trying to take a middle path approach. The middle path is neither believing nor disbelieving, but suspension of judgement. That suspension of judgement is quite a hard discipline in its own right. If you lived in such a way that your mind didn't jump to conclusions or reach judgements about things that were not apparent, it would be quite a different kind of life.


Malcolm wrote:
Incidentally, in this text, it is the agnostic position the Buddha finds the most worthy of criticism:

"When this was said, Sañjaya Belatthaputta said to me, 'If you ask me if there exists another world [after death], if I thought that there exists another world, would I declare that to you? I don't think so. I don't think in that way. I don't think otherwise. I don't think not. I don't think not not. If you asked me if there isn't another world... both is and isn't... neither is nor isn't... if there are beings who transmigrate... if there aren't... both are and aren't... neither are nor aren't... if the Tathagata exists after death... doesn't... both... neither exists nor doesn't exist after death, would I declare that to you? I don't think so. I don't think in that way. I don't think otherwise. I don't think not. I don't think not not.'

"Thus, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, Sañjaya Belatthaputta answered with evasion. Just as if a person, when asked about a mango, were to answer with a breadfruit; or, when asked about a breadfruit, were to answer with a mango: In the same way, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, Sañjaya Belatthaputta answered with evasion. The thought occurred to me: 'This — among these brahmans and contemplatives — is the most foolish and confused of all. How can he, when asked about a fruit of the contemplative life, visible here and now, answer with evasion?'

I am sorry but I must disagree. The Samaññaphala Sutta in fact talks explicitly about recollection of past lives as being such a fruit:

"With his mind thus concentrated, purified, and bright, unblemished, free from defects, pliant, malleable, steady, and attained to imperturbability, he directs and inclines it to knowledge of the passing away and re-appearance of beings. He sees — by means of the divine eye, purified and surpassing the human — beings passing away and re-appearing"

But it never says "if there is no world after death, if there is no fruit of actions rightly & wrongly done, then here in the present life I look after myself with ease — free from hostility, free from ill will, free from trouble." The passage simply does not exist in that text.

The point I am trying to make here is regarding whether you're required to believe in the phenomenon of re-birth in order to consider yourself Buddhist. Belief in rebirth is a very controversial question, as I have pointed out before -  it is taboo in Western culture, on religious and scientific grounds. But it has always been controversial to some people.  That is why I referred to the passage above, 'if there is no world after death, if there is no fruit of actions rightly & wrongly done, then here in the present life I look after myself with ease — free from hostility, free from ill will, free from trouble.' That kind of proviso is found in many places in early Buddhist texts.  So I am saying, I think you can live according to Buddhist principles, and realize the benefits of them, without necessarily accepting beliefs about re-birth, or at the very least suspending judgement about it.

Malcolm wrote:

Well, I part company there. 'Having to believe certain things' is what made me leave the Christian church.  And I say that, even though I accept the reality of Samsara.

My advice to the sceptic would be: to observe the principles and the discipline that Buddhism entails and to keep an open mind. 'Keeping an open mind' does not require 'theorizing about the ultimate nature of things' or speculating on alternative explanations of Buddhist philosophy based on science. It's a lot more basic, in my view.

Malcolm wrote:
It is not a question of forcing people to believe this or that. But there are certain understandings that it is crucial to have if one wishes to make progress in Dharma practice. Rebirth is one of those understandings. Why? Because the whole point of Buddha's teaching was free people from samsara. What is samsara? The http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn15/sn15.003.than.html explains it beautifully:

From an inconstruable beginning comes transmigration. A beginning point is not evident, though beings hindered by ignorance and fettered by craving are transmigrating & wandering on. Long have you thus experienced stress, experienced pain, experienced loss, swelling the cemeteries — enough to become disenchanted with all fabricated things, enough to become dispassionate, enough to be released.

For those who have it, the Anamattaggasaṃyutta is indispensible reading.

" The heap of bones one person leaves behind
with the passing of a single aeon, 
would form a heap as high as a mountain,
so said the Great Sage.
This is declared to be as massive
as the tall Vepulla Mountain
standing north of Vulture's Peak
in the Magadhan mountain range. 

"But when one sees with correct wisdom
the truths of the noble ones —
suffering and its origin, 
the overcoming of suffering, 
and the Noble Eightfold Path, 
that leads to suffering's appeasement —
then that person, having wandered on, 
for seven more times at most 
makes an end to suffering
by destroying all the fetters."
SN 15:10

Simply put, not one can study Mainstream Buddhism seriously and not come away understanding the crucial and central role rebirth places in the Buddha's teachings.

Prasutagus said:
Following this thread for some time, and going back to Malcolm's original post from (shudder) Tricycle, I have to ask:

Why is a marriage between Buddhism and science something that's even an issue?  We're talking about two conceptual systems with radically different interests and goals.  One is to cultivate inner qualities to eliminate suffering of self and other.  The other is to understand the functioning of the physical world in its various forms.  Why this push to certify or qualify Buddhism by extruding it through a scientific lens?

Also, it's interesting that the original (shudder) Tricycle article was about Buddhism offering a correction to the scientific materialism of modern science.... while ironically, much of this thread has been a defense of Buddhist world view against materialistic critiques.

In the end, these are both conceptual constructs-- Buddhism and science.  We really don't need to be overly rigid about either them, and allow some space between them.  In the Buddhist philosophical tradition one traditionally interpolates between various different tenet systems, again, without any drama.  That flexibility is possible here as well.  There's really no reason to shoot down Buddhism for what science finds, for science for what Buddhism finds.  We can be a little pliant, committing to a world view that says something contrary to what scientists might claim, simply for its spiritual efficacy.  We can also be a little pliant ignoring what the abhidharma says about cosmology when looking at NASA pics of Iapetus.

Malcolm wrote:
You know, we do not need to abandon the Meru cosmology system in toto at all. In reality, even Ptolemy called people who lived north of Pamirs "Kurus". Despite the fact that Vasubandhu's presentation reached a highly formalized picture of the world. In reality, the main outline in the Meru cosmology can be understood as reasonable when it is understood that four continent Meru cosmology actually roughly maps to the known continents from an India centric point of view, taking India as Jambudvipa.

Presumably since one doesn't have Right View, then one can't follow the Path to fruition. Yet, I'm curious what specific obstacles will arise along the way preventing one from successfully following the Path to completion? For example, would lack of belief in rebirth naturally preclude one from having successful direct introduction (in the Mahamudra/Dzogchen traditions)?  Or, in the Zen tradition, would it prevent one from successfully seeing one's original face? Or, would it naturally prevent one from developing boundless compassion? Or...?

Malcolm wrote:
Any discussion of so called secular or modernist "Buddhism" quickly degenerates into a discussion about rebirth, and usually only rebirth. Why? Because rebirth is not falsifiable by any means accessible for ordinary persons who have not developed sufficient skills. It is instructive to read the http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanamoli/wheel390.html. Here we discover the Buddha talking about his own rebirth, how others take rebirth after their bodies break up and so on.

What is interesting about the second one, is that it is a response to a disciple, the famed Sunakṣatra [ legs pa'i skar ma ] who claimed:

Now on that occasion Sunakkhatta, son of the Licchavis, had recently left this Dhamma and Discipline.[1] He was making this statement before the Vesali assembly: "The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones.[2] The recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma (merely) hammered out by reasoning, following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him, and when he teaches the Dhamma to anyone, it leads him when he practices it to the complete destruction of suffering."

The Buddha clearly criticizes the idea that he, the Buddha, hammered the path with logic, that is was not born of true insight. This of course is one of the reason's why I find the constant appeal of physicalists like Andrew and so on so pale. For them, everything must be "logical". But the Buddha states:

when I know and see thus, should anyone say of me: 'The recluse Gotama does not have any superhuman states, any distinction in knowledge and vision worthy of the noble ones. The recluse Gotama teaches a Dhamma (merely) hammered out by reasoning, following his own line of inquiry as it occurs to him' — unless he abandons that assertion and that state of mind and relinquishes that view, then as (surely as if he had been) carried off and put there he will wind up in hell.

In other words, by impugning the Buddha's knowledge born of concentration and insight, it does not turn out well for the person who does not abandon such views.

It is very difficult to know that "as long as "I" am bound by affliction, then "I" conventionally speaking, will take rebirth."

And that is added to the other points of the debate that we have been having.

Malcolm wrote:
I accept śabdapramāṇa explicitly, the Buddha's śabda in particular, as it proper, for example, the Pubbakotthaka sutta relates:

"Excellent, Sariputta. Excellent. Those who have not known, seen, penetrated, realized, or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction [śraddha] in others that the faculty of conviction [śraddha]... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed & pursued, gains a footing in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal & consummation; whereas those who have known, seen, penetrated, realized, & attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed & pursued, gains a footing in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal & consummation."

Here, the Buddha is clearly stating that those of us who are not stream-entrants and so on, need to take it on faith that the five faculties and so on lead to liberation. You prefer accept the śabda of scientists. That's fine, but it is not Buddhist.

This afflictive I-making is not an intellectual belief, and it cannot be routed out through merely imagining it does not exist. It reasserts itself at every turn, at every reaction, in almost everything we do. It is the root of samsara. It cannot be eradicated through intellectual analysis and so on. The point is that for as long as one in thrall of this, for that long ones' continuum will not be liberated.
Definitely agree that it's not possible that just by imagining something not existing you make it so it doesn't exist. Conventional reality comes and shocks you out of that. But then you can't really imagine the positive of that to be true - which is something happening (like rebirth) happening because you believe that it will happen.
Honestly, I would prefer that it didn't. Then, of course, I could just pursue a worldly life, with worldly goals and motivations, and when I die, that would be it.
Again, reality tends to have the final word.
Indeed.
Buddhist Modernism or Secular Buddhism are more focused on contemplation or the inner life of being a Buddhist rather than only the doctrinal aspects.
Total nonsense. These people are concerned only with the benefits meditation practice might have for them in this life. They have no bodhicitta, how could they? They do not believe in Buddhahood.

A few passages suggest that this doctrine was known even in the days of the Rigveda, and the Brahmanas often refer to doctrines of re-death and rebirth, but it was first clearly propounded in the earliest Upanishad—the Brihadaranyka. There it is stated that the soul of a Vedic sacrificer returns to earth and is reborn in human or animal form. This doctrine of samsara (reincarnation) is attributed to the sage Uddalaka Aruni, who is said to have learned it from a Kshatriya chief. In the same text, the doctrine of karma (“actions”), according to which the soul achieves a happy or unhappy rebirth according to its works in the previous life, occurs for the first time and is attributed to the theologian Yajnavalkya. Both doctrines seem to have been new, circulating among small groups of ascetics who were disinclined to make them public, perhaps for fear of the orthodox priests. These doctrines must have spread rapidly, for they appear in the later Upanishads and in the earliest Buddhist and Jain scriptures.

Read my reply to Andrew -- the aggregates of this life are serially connected with those of the next, cf, Nāgārjuna above; nevertheless, nothing transfers from this life to the next which could be described as an agent or a self. Nevertheless, there is rebirth, there is karma and the ripening of karma, all of which take place with out any substantial or real agent or actor.

The denial of rebirth is one of the two fundamental false view the Buddha describes, it is the view of non-being. Nāgārjuna describes this view as being very pernicious in more than one place.

Can you explain that experience she had? Do you care to talk about the implications of such a delog?

Andrew108 said:
Evidence is not the type of word we can use here. The implications of someone having an out of body experience and being able to see things that they are no supposed to know about poses certain logical problems. First of which is how do we see without eyes? Second is how does the information about the object travel from the object to the one perceiving the object? I would guess that light and photons have to be involved somewhere? So again how can something new be seen when there is no organ to perceive it and where there is no light doing the illuminating. The obvious answer (to me any way) is that it is seen in the 'minds eye' and that it must either be a repressed memory or a deduction that is being visualized.

I'm going to presume that you hold another view of this, so could you offer a rational explanation that can counter the explanation I have put forward?

Malcolm wrote:
Sure, such a person has a mental body with all sense organs intact (manomaya-kāya), as described by the Buddha in many places.

Basically, Andrew, the reason why I question whether you are actually a Buddhist, despite your emotional allegiance to Buddhism and time put in pursuing Buddhist studies, is that your physicalist views cause you to contradict the Buddha's own words at every turn.

Instead asking us to reevaluate our beliefs in terms of how they line up with scientific theories of mind and cognition, I think it is time for you reevaluate whether you really have faith in the Buddha's teachings and whether they really serve your purpose any longer.

From everything I have seen you say, you would be happier as a Taoist, quite honestly. They have no theory of rebirth. They value naturalism and non-contrivance, they have a quasi theory of emptiness, sort of, they sort of have dependent origination, etc.

Once rebirth (and any sort of post mortem experience) is explicitly denied, bodhicitta loses a lot of its actual meaning. Not only is the multi-lifetime career of a bodhisattva rendered null and void, but so is the idea that Buddhas always continue to work tirelessly to relieve the suffering of sentient beings (a foundational tenet of Mahayana). If this one lifetime is it, you might as well be a social worker, get involved with greenpeace, or join the peace corps you'd do a lot more good.

Yes this is the main point that you want to make. But you haven't really established logically why a literal interpretation of rebirth is valid.

Malcolm wrote:
Sure I have -- the Buddha taught literally. Anyone who spends even a little bit of time with Buddhist texts can hardly dispute that literal rebirth is a central concern of the Buddha's.

Andrew108 said:
1. You said that rebirth happens because of alayavijnana - afflicted consciousness acts as a store. You then said everyone accepts this. Not everyone accepts that there is alayavijnana not even conventionally. Prasangika for one does not accept alayavijnana.

Malcolm wrote:
Gelugpa Prasangikas do not accept the ālayavijñāna, however Candrakirti does. Jayananda, the Indian Pandita who translated the Madhyamakavatara with Batsap into Tibetan explains in his commentary on the MAV, that ālayavijñāna is a name for consciousness which has emptiness, i.e. the ālaya, as its object. Further I already explained to you what Candrakirti holds to take rebirth, the habit of I-making. Eliminate the knowledge obscuration of the habit of I-making, all birth in samsara ceases. Even tenth stage bodhisattvas have a subtle knowledge obscuration of self-grasping, while being Buddhas in practically every other respect.

Andrew108 said:
2. You cannot explain how it is that consciousness creates another moment of consciousness to the extent that consciousness can 'exist' or at least be functional when there is no physical support or external object. You would have to assert continuity. If you assert continuity then you are asserting some kind of essence - or at least something acting as an essence.

Malcolm wrote:
Nāgārjuna writes in the Pratītyasamutpadahridaya
Although the aggregates are serially connected,
the wise are to comprehend nothing has transfers
As to consciousness being "non-functional" when there is no physical senses or objects -- I agree, without physical senses, even all the traces stored in the ālayavijñāna will remain unripened. For example, four kinds of formless realm beings only have a single concept during their entire lives, i.e. the concept of "everything is consciousness", etc. They cannot have any other concept since they have no sensory input at all. However, their lifespan, lasting hundreds of millions of years is supported on karma, merit and jivendriya, the organ of lifeforce.

Andrew108 said:
3. The brain is more important than you take it to be. When the brain has problems it seems consciousness also has problems. If there were some underlying consciousness then you wonder how all of these problems like memory loss could occur? When someone's conscious experience is effected there can be seen corresponding damage within the brain. Strong logic that the brain and consciousness are intimately linked. Nearly all philosophers today accept consciousness to be brain-based.

4. Nihilists 2,500 years ago were a different breed than the nihilists today. And still today teachings on rebirth have a positive value. Especially for those who would be prone to act without a care for their actions.

Actually, the materialists of 2,500 years ago use more or less precisely the same arguments to negate rebith as materialists today. So they have not advanced that much.

Andrew108 said:
5. You don't believe in reincarnation but you do believe in rebirth. Many have taken the rebirth notion and use it to justify their bias for a transmigrating consciousness. They have also said that you can control this transmigrating consciousness and direct it. One may also use it to achieve liberation. You don't accept that though because you don't believe in a transmigrating consciousness or reincarnation.

Malcolm wrote:
Well, if you were to read back on some of my posts, you would see that I think the distinction that some try to make between reincarnation and rebirth is dubious. In English they are in fact synonymous. However, the modern convention is to treat them differently, one as a soul/atman based interpretation of migration through samsara, the other interpretation of migration in samsara absent a soul or self. As Buddhist, I think the latter is correct and the former to be mistaken.


Andrew108 said:
6. Rebirth means becoming. That is how it fits into the DO model. Thinking of it in these terms is an effective remedy for those who are prone to ignore conventional truth and to assert a kind of inertness. It is a natural law. Becoming. But we still have no logical proof that this becoming is personal to us - that we will personally continue to become again and again for as long as it takes for us to become Buddha.

Malcolm wrote:
Rebirth happens at two places in the twelve links of dependent origination, it happens at the link of consciousness, and it happens at the link of birth. The links 3 — 10 are the links of this life. Becoming is everything we do in this life, which provides the karma which informs the next life. Nāgārjuna again:
The first, eighth and ninth are affliction;
The second and the tenth are action. 
Also the remaining seven are suffering.
Twelve dharmas are gathered into three.
Two arise from three.
Seven are produced from two,
That is the wheel of existence,
it is turned again and again.

Andrew108 said:
7. Middle way teachings are subtle and easily misunderstood. Understanding emptiness isn't by itself something that liberates, but on the other hand one wonders how an understanding rebirth would lead to liberation?

Malcolm wrote:
Nāgārjuna again:
All migrating beings are causes and results.
There are no sentient beings at all. 
Empty dharmas are entirely  produced 
from dharmas strictly empty; 
dharmas without a self and [not] of a self.
In other words, liberation ensues from understanding rebirth in terms of rebirth and dependent origination. Buddha's own liberation, according to the Majjihma Nikaya was brought about because he recalled more than 90,000 of his past lives, and through doing so, understood the principle of dependent origination. In the first watch, he reviewed his own past lives, in the second watch he reviewed the samsaric travails of other beings. In the third, he watch he understood dependent origination and the four noble truths, and at that point, became the Buddha. In the http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.004.than.html:

"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, & attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of recollecting my past lives. I recollected my manifold past lives, i.e., one birth, two... five, ten... fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand, many eons of cosmic contraction, many eons of cosmic expansion, many eons of cosmic contraction & expansion: 'There I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure & pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose there. There too I had such a name, belonged to such a clan, had such an appearance. Such was my food, such my experience of pleasure & pain, such the end of my life. Passing away from that state, I re-arose here.' Thus I remembered my manifold past lives in their modes & details.

"This was the first knowledge I attained in the first watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed; light arose — as happens in one who is heedful, ardent, & resolute.

"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, & attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the passing away & reappearance of beings. I saw — by means of the divine eye, purified & surpassing the human — beings passing away & re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior & superior, beautiful & ugly, fortunate & unfortunate in accordance with their kamma: 'These beings — who were endowed with bad conduct of body, speech & mind, who reviled noble ones, held wrong views and undertook actions under the influence of wrong views — with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, in hell. But these beings — who were endowed with good conduct of body, speech, & mind, who did not revile noble ones, who held right views and undertook actions under the influence of right views — with the break-up of the body, after death, have re-appeared in the good destinations, in the heavenly world.' Thus — by means of the divine eye, purified & surpassing the human — I saw beings passing away & re-appearing, and I discerned how they are inferior & superior, beautiful & ugly, fortunate & unfortunate in accordance with their kamma.

"This was the second knowledge I attained in the second watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed; light arose — as happens in one who is heedful, ardent, & resolute.

"When the mind was thus concentrated, purified, bright, unblemished, rid of defilement, pliant, malleable, steady, & attained to imperturbability, I directed it to the knowledge of the ending of the mental fermentations. I discerned, as it had come to be, that 'This is stress... This is the origination of stress... This is the cessation of stress... This is the way leading to the cessation of stress... These are fermentations... This is the origination of fermentations... This is the cessation of fermentations... This is the way leading to the cessation of fermentations.' My heart, thus knowing, thus seeing, was released from the fermentation of sensuality, released from the fermentation of becoming, released from the fermentation of ignorance. With release, there was the knowledge, 'Released.' I discerned that 'Birth is ended, the holy life fulfilled, the task done. There is nothing further for this world.'

"This was the third knowledge I attained in the third watch of the night. Ignorance was destroyed; knowledge arose; darkness was destroyed; light arose — as happens in one who is heedful, ardent, & resolute.

Andrew108 said:
Teachings on emptiness do contain definitive aspects that once understood in direct experience do lead to liberation - they are definitive and that is not just my point of view. Consider the following from Nagarjuna:
...
Here Nagarjuna is questioning  this assumption you have of present unenlightenment and future liberation. Future liberation here is seen as a convention since by what are beings bound?

The fact that blind people who are blind at birth do not dream in images is well established. This is logical proof that consciousness relies on a material base to operate. So.....mental consciousness needs a brain. It's clear and logical.

Malcolm wrote:
Not even slightly. In the case of the five senses, it is generally the case that we consider that consciousness operates through them. But if your propose the brain as material basis of consciousness, just where in the brain is? The whole brain? This can't be the case because if it were, than modifying any part of the part of the brain would modify consciousness -- certainly we can stimulate mood, arousal, fear, etc., buy stimulating the brain in this way that. But these things are not consciousness, they are experienced by consciousness.

Andrew108 said:
What is also clear (to me) is that afflicted consciousness must be a 'special type' of consciousness because it doesn't have a specific physical basis. It seems that those proponents of afflicted consciousness view the preceding moment of this consciousness to give rise to subsequent later and different moments of the same consciousness. In effect it is consciousness being both the cause and the result of itself - like riding on your own shoulders. I have doubts about this - I am agnostic about this. I view this as a convention that has weak logic underpinning it. I view a literal interpretation of rebirth as being a convention and under-pinned by weak logic.

There are Sutric references to this type of consciousness.

Although who knows?

Malcolm wrote:
Neyartha simple means "interpretable". Nitartha means "requires no interpretation". There are different uses of these terms in different context. For example, the Avatamska-sutra refers to itself as the "definitive sūtra for practice". The Akṣayamatinirdeṣa-sutra establishes that any sūtra which talks about pretty much anything other than emptiness is provisional. I agree with the latter sutra, of course. However, it does not work to say "science is based on natural laws" for that too is provisional. There are no more natural laws than there are persons, living beings, selves and so on. You cannot have it both ways. You must either stick to your proposed ultimate perspective in which there is no cessation, no arising, no going, no coming and so on, or come down to earth.

For example, a fellow like Buddhadasa could never have even imagined negating rebirth without exposure to western science which occurred because the King of Siam, educated at Harvard in the 19th century, ordered the educational system in Thailand to adopt a western curriculum.

Incidentally, the notion that recognizing "the nature of the mind" is adequate is really a pity. A lot of yogis crash and burn on that one.

And in the case of the bodhicitta text you cite, the path is the two stages, the bodhicitta texts themselves describe the result of the two stages and nothing more.

Rebirth is something that requires understanding, not belief, because it takes place here and now through intention. Intention creates new karma, and is the result of old karma. This is the vicious circle of samsara.

If we manage to break it, and the entire old karma is burned, then there is liberation.

I don't think Malcolm is claiming that the Buddha's realisation was just rebirth.
But the texts detailing his enlightenment do depict him acquiring knowledge of rebirth, along with the noble truths.
Personally, I think it's okay to admit that one doesn't know, but I don't think confident scepticism should be employed prior to fully satisfying oneself of the opponent's arguments.

pensum said:
Malcolm, Dzongsar Khyentse and others have however claimed that accepting rebirth is a necessary condition for being a Buddhist. And yet not even Dharmakirti, let alone they, can present a sound, cogent argument for rebirth or its necessity. Whereas the nature of mind is readily accessible, provable without recourse to any external agent, by its very definition fundamental and hence its realization can be said to be infallible.

Malcolm wrote:
The problem, pensum, is that awakening is not merely understanding the nature of the mind. This is more along the lines of neo-advaita, and those folks. What is necessary for awakening, as described the Buddha, is an insight into dependent origination which causes one to relinquish fetters than bind one to samsaric rebirth.

For example, when reading the http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.135.than.html, one cannot come away with anything other than the conclusion that Buddha really meant rebirth quite literally when the subject came up.

Or here, where the Buddha discusses cosmology:

"There will be a time, monks, when this world comes to an end.[32] And at that time, beings are generally reborn in the heaven of the Radiant Deities.[33] There they live, made of mind, feeding on joy, radiating light from themselves, traversing the skies, living in glory, and thus they remain for a very long time. When the world comes to an end, monks, these Radiant Deities rank as the highest. But even for the Radiant Deities change takes place, transformation takes place.
— http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nyanaponika/wheel238.html#book-10

So it is necessary consequence that a proper Buddhist view includes rebirth; people who say otherwise are quite simply deluded about what the Dharma is.

In this case we must rely on śabda pramāṇa, the testimony of reliable witnesses, the generations of awakened people who have experienced such an "sphere" of existence through the four formless āyatanas. Why? Because such phenomena are not within the purview of those who have not developed sufficient meditative ability. The same is true of rebirth. Until you yourself attain the abhijñā of recalling past lives, you have to take it on the word of the Buddha, etc., that you have past lives.

So in this case you either accept the authority of the Buddha or you don't. There is nothing sophistic about it. You either accept that ordinary sentient beings with their ordinary powers of cognition are not capable of perceiving certain things or you don't.

In fact, the arguments of materialists that consciousness is a mere epiphenomena of brain function are quite weak and unconvincing. This is not to say that our cognitions are not moulded by our nervous system, because of course they are. That is a necessary consequence of taking a human, animal or so on body. The proof that consciousness could be rooted in material processes can only be shown by the generation of a sentient being through means which do not involve biological reproduction.

Of course rebirth can be proven logically once one understands how the Buddha structured the five aggregates.

It is a simple procedure:

Either consciousness has a material cause or it does not have a material cause.

If consciousness has a material cause, then there is no rebirth.

No material cause can be found for consciousness.

If consciousness does not have a material cause, it must have another kind of cause, i.e. a non-material cause. In which case the first moment of consciousness of this life must arise from the previous moment of consciousness of a past life, much as the present moment of consciousness one is experiencing now must have arisen from a previous moment of consciousness.

This is the basic logic used by Dharmakirti to refute materialists.

Second, this is not factual. This is not factual with respect the NIkaya teachings either.

For example, there are four types of liberated persons the Buddha mentions in the Agamas/NIkayas: stream entrants, once returners, never returners and arhats (such as the Buddha).
The only people who achieve total freedom in this life in these teachings are Arhats. Stream entrants must take rebith in the desire realm for seven lifetimes and so on.

In the case of Dzogchen there are three opportunities to achieve liberation:  in this life (only those with the highest capacity), in the bardo (medium down to high average) or in other buddhafields after taking rebirth there. This is all detailed in such tantras as the Rig pa rang shar and so on.

So it is not the case that rebirth is an teaching with a concealed intent. It is to be taken at face value, as the Buddha taught it in hundreds of places.

There is a stream of momentary afflicted consciousnesses, i.e. one moment of consciousness exists in this life (you can even calculate how many such moments a person who lives for a hundred years will have i.e. a moment of consciousness lasts for seven nano seconds) at the moment of death, it perishes, giving rise the next moment of consciousness in the bardo, where the stream continues for some time, and then, at a certain point, another moment of consciousness 'descends into the womb" i.e. appropriates a new series.

Faith is also one the ten positive mental factors, so if you are experiencing faith, you cannot be experiencing a negative mind. This is why people of faith, whether it be in Dharma, Krishna, or Karl Marx in general are more positive than people who have no faith at all.

Of course, when you have faith, in order for it be effective in taking you out of samsara, from the perspective of Dharma, the object is important. Having faith in a teaching is good, having faith in a teacher is better. Of course, it does not start as perfectly formed, it requires cultivation — but without faith, no path is possible.

removes fears, and crosses rivers,
faith shows the way to the city of bliss…

So first of all, to set out on the Buddhist path, you need faith. Until you have faith, you are not on the path in any meaningful way.

I like how in English, ChNN usually talks about the first of the Five Faculties in terms of "interest" and "confidence" rather than faith. I don't know if it's an accurate translation, but it seems to be a good upaya. You don't necessarily have to have faith in the beginning, in him or the teaching, the fact that you are attending his retreat or watching the webcast means that you have some level of interest. As you do practice more and more you gain confidence in the teaching (and in him, although he is self-effacing and never says that).

Let's put it this, no consciousness transmigrated from yesterday until today, but still you have memories, and so on. You account for this continuity by imagining that consciousness is located in the brain. I don't. Therefore, for you rebirth is impossible, while for me it isn't.

Malcolm wrote:
Whoever said an integral consciousness moved from one life to another? That is not consistent with what the Buddha taught.

A serial continuity of consciousness means exactly what the patisandhi concept in Theravada is talking about.

Conventionally, the Buddha often states in many suttas so and so disappears from this world, and appears in the next. But when we really dig down, we discover the real point is that there is a "rosary" of moments of conscious each one the case of the next, each one the result of the previous one.

The point is that if someone does not believe in rebirth, karma and so on, there is little point in their studying or practicing any form of Buddhism whether Theravada, Zen or Dzogchen.

Your conclusions are problematic. The Kālacakra and Kośa are separated by six or seven centuries.

Not at all:

Each beat of the heart involves five major stages. The first two stages, often considered together as the "ventricular filling" stage, involve the movement of blood from the atria into the ventricles. The next three stages involve the movement of blood from the ventricles to the pulmonary artery (in the case of the right ventricle) and the aorta (in the case of the left ventricle)...The fourth stage, "ventricular ejection," is when the ventricles are contracting and emptying, and the semilunar valves are open. During the fifth stage, "isovolumic relaxation time", pressure decreases, no blood enters the ventricles, the ventricles stop contracting and begin to relax, and the semilunar valves close due to the pressure of blood in the aorta.

The fourth and fifth stage is where that actual "beat" that you feel exists.

I do not think that Indians feverishly adhered to their various cosmologies literally as Tibetans, and so on did. For one thing, Indians were awfully good at astronomy, and Meru cosmology as presented in the Kośa for example, certainly conflicts with Indian astronomical treatises written near the same time. No Buddhist mathematician working on calendars could have squared their calculations with the motion of the sun and moon around Meru as described. This is quite evident when the calculations in the Kalacakra are analyzed and then compared with the modified Meru Cosmology presented in the Kalacakra. See Henning, Kalacakra and the Tibetan Calendar.

I consider the Kośa cosmology anachronistic, and see no need to take it literally. There are also several cosmologies in Buddhist texts, not only one.

But when I do Mandala offerings, I definitely visualize the universe in that way.

No, the materialist paradigm does not allow for such.

However Dharma paradigm allows for the action to effect the actor. Repeated action even more powerfully so. This same facet of karma explains both how repeated actions can create a drug addict or a virtuoso violinist. If someone can relate to those teachings they should be allowed to use them as a basis for further consideration.

Thank you. I just want to point out that I in no way conflate "science", which is a practice, with "scientific materialism", which is a belief system.

Prasutagus said:
As someone trained as a scientist, this type of conversation gets heavily leveraged by assumptions as to what science is and is not.

There aren't physical laws scribbled onto the side of the box the universe came in, and if we look hard enough, we'll find the box, and thus the laws, and *poof* know how things work.  It doesn't work that way.  What we call "physical laws" are really conceptual schema for describing subjective experiences of the world.  Those laws become more refined as our subjective experience of the world becomes more  refined through the use of technologies.

The scientist is able to fall into the fault of physicalism every bit as much as the Buddhist.  Scientists will often talk about these conceptual schema as if they actually exist.  Nobody has seen an electron but we talk about them as they exist, not to mention quarks, photons and other inventions to describe phenomena. We talk about matter as if it's real, even though, from a physical sense it is made of point quanta and that everything that we really experience is the interactions between the quanta and not the point quanta.  Turn everything off and it collapses onto a single point.

If physicalism is a dead end for the scientist, it certainly is for the Buddhist.  Trying to reconcile Buddhism with the physicalist dead end of the intellectually naive scientist is no virtue.

Regarding quantum mechanics-- we can roll two ways with that, and I think that's pertinent to this discussion.

The basis of QM is that observations are non-commutative.  That means it depends upon whether we measure something's position in one direction before the momentum in another, and so on.  This is the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.  We can look at that in two ways.  One, this is how the quantum world behaves upon observation.  As such, we can say this is a property of the geometry or space that things exist in.  The flip side of that is that we can say this is how consciousness operates when observing things small enough and discrete enough to notice.  QM is then really describing mind, and mind is more fundamental than all these little quanta.

No, Virginia, there is no physical reality separate from mind, and many scientists are coming to see that.

Do you say that habit & such are not included in the teachings of karma? I believe it is under the heading of "consequences that reflects the germ of the act". If so, then what A108 is taking as his (current) interpretation could be seen as a correct, albeit partial, understanding of the whole theory.

-The thing/experience I have that is aware of the coming and going of thoughts?
-The thing/experience I have that is still present when there are no thoughts?

For as long as one has not overcome one's afflictions, for that long one will be subject to the rounds of rebirth. When one overcomes one's afflictions, one will no longer be subject to the rounds of rebirth and the ripening of karma, both positive and negative.

The Buddhist teaching of karma is not deterministic in any ultimate sense; but as long as one has not freed oneself from the three poisonous afflictions, one will still be subject to the effects of the fruit of actions committed while under their influence. For example, a bad king may not have an inherent position, but he and his evil ministers still dominate the subjects. But when the bad king is overthrown, his evil ministers lose their power too, and the subjects are free from their rule. Likewise, we are not inherently afflicted, but we are still dominated by afflictions. When we throw off our afflictions, the king, also we are free from his evil ministers, the result of afflicted actions.

But this is not deterministic. In order for the Buddha's teaching to be deterministic, one would have imagine that afflictions were inherent, but there is nothing in Dharma that states this is so, and quite a lot that rejects it.

What is stated is that karma is unerring, and will always ripen as long as conditions for its ripening are present.

At least in my naive view, I feel now that it's all a big pot of karma and we are what we are by picking up some part of it.

What sort of critique of the scientific view might Buddhism otherwise offer? The naturalistic stance—the idea that there is an independent insentient world out there governed by scientific laws and impersonal processes—is ultimately a human construct, a powerful and effective human construct, but a construct nonetheless. This is not to deny the power of science, but it does call into question the way we approach scientific knowledge. Of course, there are many philosophers, scientists, and historians of science who have made a similar point. But Buddhism has its own insights and perspectives to offer. In other words, when we engage seriously with the Buddhist tradition we learn other ways of construing the world, other stories we can tell about the way things are, and these can be cogent, coherent, and compelling in their own way. This is not to argue for a naive acceptance of Buddhist epistemology and cosmology. But we won't see what Buddhism has to offer if, at the outset, we twist it out of shape to make it conform to contemporary norms.

As far as I know, for a lay follower of Buddhism, the only rule so to speak is adultery. Other things like rape, pedophilia & incest besides being prohibited in Buddhism are also illegal in most if not all western countries.

Karma Jinpa said:
shaunc, if I wasn't clear before, I apologize.  I figured since most of us are, like you, lay-practitioners, that we would discuss sexual misconduct as it pertains to upasakas & upasikas, rather than monastics.  While I'm sure it's more nuanced in the Vinaya, the practical rule of thumb for monastics (whether monk or nun) is celibacy, so any sexual conduct would be considered misconduct.

That's one of the reasons Khen Rinpoche's statement is so striking to me, If I'm honest with myself. Transformation of Suffering is a very accessible, down-to-earth explanation of the the Mahayana/Vajrayana Dharma, from the Four Thoughts to Refuge & Bodhicitta and the Six Paramitas.  He's most certainly talking to us lay-followers/householders throughout the whole book.

shaunc, which tradition (school/lineage) was the lama who gave you that explanation of misconduct, if I may ask?  No need to mention your individual teachers.

That leads me to my next question...  Are the vows interpreted differently between the different schools and lineages?  Or do Rinpoche's words in ToS match directly with what is said in the Mulasarvastivada Vinaya where we get our Pratimoksha vows?

Malcolm wrote:
Generally, all this is explained in Abhidharmakosha. Sexual misconduct for lay people is wrong partner, wrong orifice, wrong time, wrong place.

Wrong partner means someone who is 1) not your spouse 2) underage 3) under the authority of another 4) ordained.

Wrong orifice means 1) anal 2) oral

Wrong time means daytime

Wrong place means in public, in a temple, in general in places where there is no privacy.

At that time, Maha-Moggallana lived alone in a forest hut at Kalasila. After his encounter with Mara he knew that the end of his days was near. Having enjoyed the bliss of liberation, he now felt the body to be just an obstruction and burden. Hence he had no desire to make use of his faculties and keep the body alive for the rest of the aeon. Yet, when he saw the brigands approaching, he just absented himself by using his supernormal powers. The gangsters arrived at an empty hut, and though they searched everywhere, could not find him. They left disappointed, but returned on the following day. On six consecutive days Moggallana escaped from them in the same way. His motivation was not the protection of his own body, but saving the brigands from the fearsome karmic consequences of such a murderous deed, necessarily leading to rebirth in the hells. He wanted to spare them such a fate by giving them time to reconsider and abstain from their crime. But their greed for the promised money was so great that they persisted and returned even on the seventh day. Then their persistence was "rewarded," for on that seventh day Moggallana suddenly lost the magic control over his body. A heinous deed committed in days long past (by causing the death of his own parents) had not yet been expiated, and the ripening of that old Kamma confronted him now, just as others are suddenly confronted by a grave illness. Moggallana realized that he was now unable to escape. The brigands entered, knocked him down, smashed all his limbs and left him lying in his blood. Being keen on quickly getting their reward and also somewhat ill as ease about their dastardly deed, the brigands left at once, without a further look.

At least the Buddha's teaching on karma, contained in such texts as the String of Pearls Tantra and others, actually explains to them why they are suffering.

"I am suffering"

"This  negative sensation you are experiencing is a ripening of your karma."

"I feel pleasure"

"This positive sensation you are experiencing is a ripening of your karma."

"I feel neither suffering or pleasure."

"This neutral  sensation you are experiencing is a ripening of your karma."

Etc.

At that time, the signs of awareness are as follows:
the mind of someone who has 
purified karma is clear. 
In the same way, if [karma] is not purified, [the mind] is not clear. 
All of that arises from positive and negative karma.

For the Sarvastivadins however, all suffering, even suffering caused by natural disasters, requires some kind of karmic cause.

Malcolm wrote:
Dave,

You took rebirth in samsara. Samsara has three kinds of suffering, according to Shariputra in the Majjihma Nikāya, suffering of suffering, the suffering of change and the suffering of compounded things. Therefore, everything in samsara is suffering.  We only take rebirth because of our karma and for no other reason. Since we are reborn in samsara, and there is nothing but suffering, there is no other reason for any of our suffering than karma, either directly, as the Sarvastivadins maintain, or indirectly, as the Theravadins must in the end admit. But there are some people who call themselves Buddhists who actually imagine that there is some kind of happiness in Samsara. These people are a little mistaken.

Your citation of the Anguttara Nikaya does not in any way refute my contention all our suffering comes from past causes of our own creation. That's why I cited the Anguttara Nikaya back at you. I never said anywhere that everything we do now was caused by something we did in the past. Essentially, what I am saying is that all positive, negative and neutral sensations we experience in the three realms are a result of the ripening of positive, negative and neutral actions. You have carried a misunderstanding of my position from our last conversation about this.

You mean ultimately there is no good or bad action. But even in Dzogchen, relatively speaking there is good and bad action. As the String of Pearls Tantra states:

One is placed in the dungeon of name and matter
in the castle of the three realms,
tortured with the barbs of ignorance and so on, 
oppressed by the thick darkness of samsara, 
attached to the salty taste of desire, 
bound by the neck with the noose of confusion, 
burned with the hot fire of hatred, 
head covered with pride, 
setting a rendezvous with the mistress of jealousy, 
surrounded by the army of enmity...
tied by the neck with the noose of subject and object, [29b]
stuck in the mud of successive traces
and handcuffed with the ripening of karma.
Having been joined with the ripening of karma, 
one takes bodies good and bad, 
one after another like a water wheel,
born into each individual class.
Having crossed at the ford of self-grasping, 
one sinks into the ocean of suffering
and one is caught by the heart on the hook of the three lower realms.
One is bound by oneself; the afflictions are the enemy. 
The body of a hell being appears as fire or water.
Pretas are frightened and intimidated.
There is a fog-like appearance for animals.
The aggregates, sense gates and sense elements
of humans appear as the five elements,
and also happiness, suffering and indifference. 
They appear as armor and weapons to asuras 
and desirable qualities for devas. 
Such dualistic appearances,
for example, are like a quickly moving wheel
spinning continuously for a long while. 
As such, diverse appearances
are like seeing a snake from a rope;
that [rope] is not [a snake] but is apprehended as a [snake];
forming as both the outer universe and inhabitants.
If that is investigated, it is a rope.
The universe and inhabitants have always been empty,

There is also the issue that indeed pornography is quite widespread in Tibetan exile community in general, and has been for quite a long time, for at least twenty years.  It would be extremely naive to believe that adolescent promiscuity in Tibetan monasteries does not happen. Of course it does. But as I already pointed out, most of these kids are not expected to become monks in adult hood. Many of them are being sent their by their parents because they want then to have a religious education.

The problem with this whole conversation, apart from its origins in an clumsy attempt to discredit certain Tibetan cultural beliefs that have nothing to with the Dharma, is that is exists in a vacuum absent a whole range of sociological considerations.

Believe what you like. But you might want to study a bit of sutra and tantra before you make such bold claims.

In fact, since all phenomena are actually the display of a buddha's wisdom, there is in fact nothing that a buddha cannot know. Buddhas are omniscient, they are not, however, omnipotent.

It means "not seeing the characteristics of phenomena". Since that is perceived with respect to all phenomena, a Buddha is omniscient. It does mean, as Dharmakiriti famously quipped, that a Buddha knows the number of maggots in the ground.

It means that they know the nature of all phenomena and all the details of all paths to become buddhas.

Andrew108 said:
You are changing the meaning of the word. So it might be better to use a different term. Knowing the nature of all phenomenon is not the same as omniscience.

omni | sarva     | thams cad  | all

Latin | Sanskrit | Tibetan | English

In this case, knowing the nature of all phenomena bears the consequence that one's mind is unimpeded and thus one can also know all the details, should one wish to.

Since that time, I have not heard any Tibetan Buddhist teacher (especially those connected with Kalu Rinpoche) publicly respond to his allegations, let alone suggest there be a formal investigation and those responsible brought to account.

You have linked three things in a rather clumsy attempt at being "critical": Vajrayāna claims of rapidity, one instance where a tulku alleges he was repeatedly gang raped as a young boy, and the general competence of tulkus as enlightened administrators in order to cast doubt on Vajrayāna claims (addressed above).

However, items two and three have no relation to item one.

Aside from the fact that the Mañjuśrimulakapa Tantra makes predictions about reincarnations which appear in various countries including Tibet; the tulku system as it presently exists is not part of Vajrayāna theory in anyway. It is not mentioned in the tantras, nor the treatises and is a religious custom which first evolved in Tibet during the 13th century among the Kagyus. It continues solely because Tibetan society demands that it does.

Since there is no precedent for the tulku system in Vajrayāna, the effectiveness of tulkus as administrators, even the question of whether tulkus are actually awakened beings or not, is completely irrelevant to Vajrayāna claims about rapidity of its path.

Since there is no precedent for the tulku system in Vajrayāna, there is no reason to expect that tulkus are awakened beings, and no reason to expect that they would be able affectively manage any sexual abuse of minors in their care in any manner other then conventional ones. I.e., the actions need to be discovered, the perpetrators brought to justice, and so on.

This means that your complaints, apart from the fact that they are malicious gossip, amount to nothing more than a hill of beans.

The net effect of your unsubstantiated rumors and gossip is that some chicken-minded people will hear such things, and they too will then start spreading this gossip to others.

The fact is that there is no evidence at all of wide-spread systematic abuse of children, sexual or otherwise, in Tibetan monasteries in India. To claim otherwise without evidence is simply malicious. Of course, everyone is responsible for their own actions and their own karma. And since as Buddhists we all accept that karma is unerring, those who spread gossip, lies and half-truths can easily understand what kind of suffering they will experience from their own actions, not the least of which is that those who would formally have been inclined to lend them an ear, will not be well disposed to in future.

We have the PRC, literally raping Tibet and sterilizing Tibetan women after forcing them to have late term abortions, resettling Tibetan nomad in concrete villages and restricting the number of cattle they can own, fencing off their traditional grazing lands, but no, we don't really hear about this.

What we here about instead are unfocused accusations against real bodhisattvas like HHDL to the effect that they, like the Catholics, are knowingly complicit in covering up sexual abuse of children in monasteries -- and this goes unremarked and uncorrected by the staff.

As Khedrup just pointed out, as for the others, there are many ways of maintaining one's samaya vows, which in any case are meant to assist one's practice. Since taking rebirth in the three lower realms is an eventual surety for all sentient beings who are not on a path, samaya vows are the skillful means we use in Vajrayāna to make sure that we do not become complacent about our paths and practice.

and after 1 dharma debate withdrew from Chinese intellectual currents unlike the Koreans, Vietnamese Japanese, etc who particpated in cross-cultural exchange and development.

Malcolm wrote:
To begin with the debate was not between Tibetan and Chinese protagonists; it was between Indians and Chinese protagonists, sponsored by the Tibetan king, in imitation of similar debates in India. The debate actually occurred over three years, via letters, though people often imagine that it was a one-off smack down with Kamalashila emerging the proclaimed victor. In reality, the account of the debate which later Tibetans inherited was penned by a scion of the Ba clan, who were part of the anti-Chinese faction within the Tibetan aristocracy.

However the debate turned out, and there is no real clear answer to this question, the Tibetans decided that Chinese Buddhism did not represent the latest developments and currents of Indian Buddhism, and so after about 50 years of experience with Chinese Buddhism decided to devote their attentions to the Buddhism being taught at the great universtities in India, Nalanda, Somanatha, Vikramashila and so on instead. In other words, they did a perfectly understandable thing: they decided that the Buddhism they found in India was more authentic than the Buddhism they were being introduced to by the Chinese monastics stationed in Lhasa. It is unlikely that the best and the brightest were send to Lhasa, since the Chinese considered Tibet a barbarian backwater.

Moreover, the Tibetans were attracted to the ritualism of Yoga tantra (there was no anuttarayoga appellation at this time), and they had a shrine built at Samye where the Vajradhātu maṇḍala practice could be regularly performed with a special image of Mahāvairocana crafted for that purpose. It still exists at Samye. The influence of the practice Sarvatathāgatatattva samgraha tantra pervades all of Tibetan Buddhism right down to this day.

Part of the lack of interest of Tibetans with currents in Chinese Buddhism also can be attributed to the fact that Chinese Buddhism was largely destroyed during the reign of the Taoist emperor, Wuzong in 845. As a result of the economic decline of Asia from 845 onward, and due to the chaos of the Five Dynasties period, there really was no Buddhism in China for that could interest Tibetans for the simple reason that Chinese Buddhism was institutionally destroyed by its own people.

Therefore, as Tibet society recovered its own economic stability in the mid 10th century, Yeshe Ö (947–1024 or 959 - 1040), the great, great grandson of Langdarma, the last of the Yarlung Kings, initiated a revival of Buddhist transmissions from India by sending a number of young men in Kashmir to learn Sanskrit and translate texts.

So in fact your castigation of Tibetans for not engaging in cultural exchange misses the mark completely. The Tibetans controlled Central Asia during most of the 8th and 9th centuries, and they maintained constant ties with India and Nepal from the late 9th century onwards. The Tibetans above all were great traders. They simply were more interested in what they saw in India than what they saw in China, as with China they had a neighbor with whom they had had constant struggles. The Tibetans never had any wars with any Indian kingdoms at all.

If you carefully examine Tibetan history, you will discover rather swiftly that Lamas were rarely in positions of significant political authority either, the 5th and the 13th being notable exceptions.

For example, after the death of the 5th, the affairs of state were conducted by the regent, Desrid Sangyas Gyatso, a lay person his whole life. During most of the 18th century, and most of the 19th, the Dalai Lamas played no significant role in governing Tibet. Even the 7th's government lasted only 6 years, from 1751 to his death in 1757. From 1707 to this period of time, Central Tibet has a variety of regimes and it was a time of intense political instability.

There were five Dalai Lamas between the 7th and the 13th in a space of 120 years.

Furthermore, "Tibet" is a big place. Lhasa never controlled Kham (always ruled by independent kings) and Amdo (ruled by a mixture of Muslim, Mongol and Chinese warlords at various times), lost Ladakh to Kashmir in the 18th century, etc.

Malcolm wrote:
There is no doubt about how active Tibetans were in bringing Dharma to Tibet in this period. The vast majority of sūtras were translated in the late imperial period, ending with the death of Ralpachan in 838.

Tibetan accounts paint Trisong Detsen as a king too busy to practice, but nevertheless an interested patron of Dharma.

Ralpacan on the other hand was quite zealous and religious, and like most religious zealots, proved to be a rather incompetent ruler, his downfall hastened by economic discontent due to the very generous relationship he had with monastic establishment.This provoked the backlash amongst the aristocracy that resulted in the assassination of Ralpacan, and the ascension of Langdarma, who tried to tax the monasteries (which resulted in his own assassination).

However, the fact that Tibetans were enthusiastically adopting Buddhism is born out by the fact that by 1000, almost all traces of any organized pre-Buddhist religion in Tibet had completely vanished. Without the strong sponsorship of the Yarlung kings, this would have never happened.

All we can really glean from the citation, knowing what we know about the war that the King of Tsang thrust upon the 5th when he was a very young man, not that much younger than you, is that during the 1660's there continued to be pockets of unrest by dissenters whom 5th felt that had abandoned their obligation to follow the rule of law, which now squarely rested with his government.

No context at all was given in your original citation.

Malcolm wrote:
My point of course is that these were violent religious militants of a kind completely unknown in Tibet.

While wars in Tibet often broke down along sect lines, they were never carried out by religious people, though religious people were frequently victims of violence that generally occurred along sectarian lines. Generally speaking, in Tibet when some aristocratic family decided to go to war with another one, the monasteries they patronized would suffer if they lost, for example, the Karma Kagyu, Jonangpas and Sakyapas suffered when Karma Tenkyong lost to the Ganden Phodrang. Since Karma Tenkyong was actually the aggressor in the war for the control of Tsang (following in his father's footsteps) in the mid 17th century, the actions of the Ganden Phodrang must considered in that light. Plus, the 5th Dalai Lama was quite young, a man of a mere 25 years when Gushri Khan executed Karma Tenkyong (1642).

In fact the 5th was the first real religious ruler of Tibet. While Chogyal Phagpha was nominally the ruler of Tibet, he spent little time in Tibet, mostly being in Beijing with Kublai Khan.

So it is simply wrong to characterize the wars in Tibet as being wars brought by one religious establishment against another. In general, wars in Tibet were fought by aristocratic clans by soldiers and never monks.

The phenomena of militarized clergy never existed in Tibet, even with the existence of monastic police (Dob dobs, restricted to Lhasa and mainly active during the Monlam Chenmo).

When there were conflicts between Sakya and Drikung, in general, in the case of Drikungpas, they had patrons among Mongols, and so they used Mongol troops to sack the main monastery at Sakya. The Sakyas, if I understand correctly, used local soldiers when they retaliated.

The Ganden Phodrang under the 5th had a standing army. However, by the nineteenth century and 200 hundred years of being finlandized by the Qing, Lhasa had no real army to speak of. For this reason the 13th tried to create a modern army to repel the invasion that he knew was coming from China.

The fact is all the hostilities in Central Tibet were provoked by the King of Tibet, Karma Tenkyong. Karma Tenkyong allied himself with the Bonpo King of Beri, Donyo Dorje. A letter was intercepted by the Gelugpas indicating a conspiracy between Karma Tenkyong and Donyo Dorje, etc. This Wiki page is based on reliable books:

What is left out of the Sperling piece is that the 5th was very conflicted about the secular actions demanded of him as a secular ruler. His qualms are spread through his 4 volume autobiography. As a ruler, he had to make recourse to the stick. It's what rulers must do. He however did not seek power, he was installed as a young boy and was at the mercy of his ministers and inherited a political world that was not of his making, though he left an indelible mark.

Heinrich Harrer: "in the days of the fifth Dalai Lama (in the eighteenth century), and even under the thirteenth (1900- 33), Tibetans still had their hands and feet chopped off."

"Whipping was legal and common as punishment in Tibet including in the 20th century, also for minor infractions and outside judicial process.

He died from his wounds 2 days later in the Potala prison. Tashi Tsering, a self-described critic of traditional Tibetan society, records being whipped as a 13 year old for missing a performance as a dancer in the Dalai Lama's dance troop in 1942, until the skin split and the pain became excruciating."

There were a total of five executions carried out by the Tibetan government in the 19th century.

Capital punishment was really quite rare in old Tibet, and not the frequent occurrence it is today under Communist rule.

Let us abandon Tibetan for the moment.

There are basically four kinds of initiations:

abhiṣekas [dbang skur, empowerment] = this is your full empowerment, generally takes two days.
adhiṣṭhānas [byin brlabs, blessing] = this a way of conferring the four empowerments in a short hand, called "don dbang" in Nyingma.
anujñāta [rjes gnang, permission] = this is a type of ritual derived from end of an abhiṣeka where various kinds of permissions are granted, such as permission to recite a mantra, visualize oneself as the deity, and understand the deity's wisdom and one's mind are the same. In general, the more strict schools like Sakya consider that properly speaking, one must have received an abhiṣeka before receiving an adhiṣṭhānas or an anujñāta
Then there is a final rite known as a "rig gtad", a kind of rite for entrusting someone with a vidyāmantra from Kriya tantra, i.e. it permits you to recite the mantra.

There is also a srog gtad, an entrustment rite for worldly protectors.

There is what is called a gtor dbang in Nyingma, where the torma is blessed as the basis of the empowerment, not a mandala.

Also in Dzogchen there is the so called "rig pa'i rtsal dbang", the empowerment of the power of the vidyā, more or less an expansion of the word empowerment. There are a number of other empowerments in Dzogchen as well such as the rgyal ba spyi blugs, and so on, more or less variations on the theme of the rig pa'u rtsal dbang.

There is finally, the empowerment of the descent of the wisdom vajra described in Indrabhuti's Jñānasiddhi, an influential text on Mahāmudra.

And that's about it, and in all of this there is no pre-recorded video abhiṣeka, etc., at least, not until this century.

It is only in the second and third sections on vipaśyāna in snang gsum and so on that freedom from extremes and inexpressibility is meditated.

@ Astus, this way of meditating the view is actually derived from the section on the meditating the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, termed "the three points of practice", i.e. mind, illusion and insubstantiality.

Since the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana as well as the three points of practice should only be discussed with those who have received the Hevajra cause empowerment etc., and the instruction of the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, I will leave it here.

In other words, if you really want to understand this you should meditate it properly.

Therefor i's implied that what they have archieved is pretty much unarchievable for any "ordinary folk" followers anyway. People are not exactly encouraged to aspire the same. (that one day you can teach vajrayana it not exactly something you should aspire like becoming a mechanic, but still it's to such an extent unthinkable that people psychologically limit themselves I think)

It is very likely that within the next thirty years there will be a plethora of western teachers who can give a limited set of empowerments. It will be a hundred years before there is a genuine western lineage head.

I continue to maintain that industrially produced meat (and plantfood) is a bane for the environment to this day, and that it should be avoided. I still do not cook meat in my home.

If there are people who can be vegetarian and be healthy, I applaud them. I cannot. In general, I consume some meat because it is good for me to do so, physically. The two times in my life when I went for extended periods of time without eating meat, my health suffered a great deal, and not because I was not eating correctly. In general as a physician, I see a lot of people who really do need to eat meat and who feel better when they do.

Give yourself another 20 years and you will be laughing at your youthful opinions of today, especially when some 28 or 30 year old tells you that his or her generaition is more open-minded than yours.

I have live for five decades; what I have learned is that for every decade there are opinions about life that are shared among those people who live in that decade, and that people who have not reached a certain decade generally cannot imagine that the people who have reached that decade have anything worthwhile to say just based on lived experience. But the fact is that the older you get, the more things just stay the same, young people like yourself have been bitching about older people since the dawn of humanity and will continue to do so, and older people will continue to shake their heads in amusement as they watch the younger generations continue to make the same damn mistakes they did.

Since the procedures for empowerment into HYT mandalas actually depend on yoga tantras such as the Sarvatathāgatatattvasamgraha, there is an unusual degree of conformity in methodology amongst the HYT tantras for how to give an empowerment into an HYT mandala.

We find very little controversy over the procedure for granting empowerments within the Indian texts themselves. Naturally, different empowerments all have their special features, but in general they all follow a fairly standard model.

There is a fair amount of controversy among Tibetans over what constituted a proper maturational rite; the Nyingmapas and Kagyus being on the loose side of things, the Sakyapas being on the strict side of things, Gelugpas somewhere in the middle. If you are interested in these debates, then you need to read Sapan's Clear Differentiation of the Three Codes and the responses to it by various Kagyu and Nyingma authors. You can also read Tsele Natshog Rangdrol book on empowerments, as well as what Kongtrul has to say on the subject.

But even where there is some debate amongst Tibetans over whether "blessings" (sbyin rlabs) as opposed to full empowerements (dbang skur) have the necessary features to properly introduce one into Vajrayāna, there was never any debate at all that one must properly receive some kind of empowerment in person from the guru in order to be considered someone who has received samaya.

And as you know, this would clearly exclude recorded empowerments from consideration.

Malcolm wrote:
The source of empowerments are the Buddha Vajradhara's wisdom, set down in words in the tantras. If someone is a person who has faith in Vajrayāna, it is hard to maintain that one has faith in Vajrayāna and yet disbelieves the verity of the basic texts of Vajrayānā.

For example, the Kalacakra tantra contains a chapter which explains empowerments in great detail.

Empowerments themselves are a method, working with causes and results, bases of purification, purifiers and results of purification which are taught in the tantras. Empowerment is a method, and it has certain procedures to ensure it is successful.

Secondly, there are the instructions of Mahāsiddhas like Naropa who have realized the result of the path, and who have written commentaries on empowerments, such as the Sekkhodesha, etc.

Then there are of course commentaries written by learned scholars on these things who nevertheless may not have realization and so on.

At base, the fundamental principle of an empowerment is to reverse samsaric dependent origination.

JohnJ said:
I apologize for any redundant questions, and questions that are off topic from this thread, but since the teachings of ChNN were brought up again I'd like to make sure my understanding is clear.

By full empowerment, am I correct in understanding that you mean one that includes all 4 empowerments and has the necessary physical supports?     Your answer earlier seemed to indicate that for students of the right capacity, direct introduction could suffice for their ripening, and so a full empowerment would not be necessary, while for students of lesser capacity a full empowerment is definitely necessary.  Have I understood this correctly, according to the Dzogchen perspective and teachings of ChNN?

Is the central difference between a meaning empowerment and a full physical empowerment, according to ChNN, found in whether or not there are physical supports?   If there is greater underlying difference, could you say a few words as to what that difference is?   For instance, sometimes ChNN states that for many people a meaning empowerment can be much more important than a traditional empowerment, does this also have to do with one's capacity?

My questions centrally revolve around the meaning of the word 'full' in this explanation of empowerment, since I have never thought the teachings and path presented by ChNN was lacking, or "not full".

Thank you in advance for helping to clarify any misunderstandings that I might have on this issue.

Malcolm wrote:
A full empowerment generally takes two days (though it can all be done in one) and has an elaborate version of the vase empowerment, etc. Empowerments that do not have that are called "blessings" according to the new tantras and "meaning empowerments" according to the system of anuyoga because they do not have the preparation phase and the four empowerments are given symbolically.

The Garland of Pearls Tantra, one of the 17 Dzogchen tantras, maintains that for students of lesser capacity all four empowerments are necessary, while students of higher capacity or experience may require only direct introduction. The sgra thal gyur definitely states that empowerments are a necessary requirement and so on.

Also worth noting that His Holiness has said on numerous occasions that he gives the Kalachakra empowerment as skillful means to give introductory and fundamental teachings since tons of people will come from far and wide for such a high empowerment but the vast majority of them won't receive it in actuality.

I find this whole thread a little disturbing.

There are many very highly qualified masters, with genuine realization, who offer a variety of teachings across a wide range of topics (lam rim, dialectics, empowerments, tantric grounds & paths, kyerim and dzogrim instructions, pointing-out and pith instructions) in a wide range of contexts (one-one, informally through skillful means, in groups, in teaching retreats, in practice retreats)-- which happen to include modern technologies such as recording and webcasts.

Malcolm wrote:
You are overshooting the mark here with your objections.

The only thing I question, and quite rightly so as far as I am concerned, is the practice of some students encouraging other students to believe that watching a video of an empowerment constitutes receiving that empowerment. I have never once called into question the practice of attending live webcasts, following a course through the mail, and so on.

My concern is quite real, since I think that this belief that one can receive an empowerment or even the transmission of a mantra from a recording will do serious damage to Vajrayāna teachings.

This was never an issue. The issue is not whether someone can receive an empowerment through the internet.

The issue is whether one can receive an empowerment from watching a video of an empowerment that took place at an earlier time. This is impossible and I have given many reasons for why this is impossible.

I think many people are largely ignorant of what an empowerment actually is, and so believe all kinds of strange things are possible when in fact they are not. Such thinking truly involves abandoning the Buddha's teaching "where this exists, that exists, where this does not exist, that does not exist." Believing that one can receive an empowerment from watching a video is similar to believing that one can be sustained by looking at a picture of a fine meal. In reality, one will only be fed by sitting down at a real table and eating a real meal.

The point is not to deprive people of an avenue for making a Dharma connection. The point is to make sure that people actually make a Dharma connection.

If you take someone as a guru, and request empowerment and so on from them, then you have a connection with that person even if their motivation is wrong. Why?

It is similar with an ordination of a monk. If the rite is not properly executed, the ordination does not happen. Someone can intend to be a monk with all the right motivation in the world; but if they do not receive the ordination from a properly constituted quorum, they cannot be considered a bhikṣu. On the other hand, someone who wishes to become a monk for power and fame becomes a monk if they ordain in front of a properly constituted quorum.

As for an empowerment, it is the case that an unawakened person can bestow an empowerment which produces the cause and condition for another to achieve awakening in this very life, for example, in the case of Kotalipa who achieved the state of mahāmudra, and whose own guru begged him to become a disciple. Why? Because the rites of maturation during an empowerment are effective. They work because of dependent origination.

An analogy might be with a wedding ceremony. What counts as a valid ceremony? Can it be performed by proxy (i.e., with a third person standing in for one of the couple)? Some religions, notably Catholicism, conceive of marriage (or technically, sacramental marriage--the following would not apply to natural marriage) as indeed involving some kind of spiritual bond, which comes into existence only under certain precise conditions. Others, notably Buddhism, defer to whatever standards each society may have.

Malcolm wrote:
The analogy is not apt. We are not comparing what an empowerment is in Buddhism and Catholicism.

Further, the definitions and procedures of empowerments (a practice unique in Vajrayāna Buddhism with unique requirements) are defined in the basic literature of the Vajrayāna (the tantras); unlike marriage ceremonies which are extra-canonical rites; despite the fact that there are considered one of the seven sacraments of the church.

There are hundreds of texts written by Indian masters on the subject of empowerments, how to conduct them, for all four classes of tantras.

There have been some disagreements among Tibetans in the past as to what constitutes a proper "maturational empowerment" -- those interested can read Sakya Pandita's Clear Differentiation of the Three Vows and the various responses to it by Kagyu masters such as Pawo Tsuglag Trengwa and so on (Here the issue is whether a sbyin rlabs can be considered to "mature" or "ripen" a student).

Nevertheless, everyone agrees that without an empowerment one is not matured as a student of Vajrayāna. The question here is whether one can be ripened by or receive an empowerment from an inanimate object such as a "blessed" picture, book or a movie. The answer is, "Of course not."

This is why ChNN repeatedly says there is no such thing as taking an empowerment as a blessing, and forgoing the commitments. It is actually impossible, and when you are told "You can take this as a blessing", and you think this means you do not have samaya, or a vajra relationship with that teacher, or the practice and so on, you don't understand anything.

During an empowerment, there are two sections: the self-empowerment conducted by a qualified master which includes such things as preparing the the space, and so on, which culminates in the master conferring the empowerment upon himself into the mandala and the creation of the front mandala as well as the vase mandala.

Second, when all this is done, then the master again repeats the sadhana, creating each disciple as the mandala they into which they are to be initiated: this stage is called creating the samayasattva, the commitment being. Then, when this has been done, the master summons the jñānasattva, the wisdom being, into each disciple who is present. In a very serious empowerment this is done one by one, i.e. the master visualizes each disciple separately as the deity, and is the reason why the most serious and proper way to give empowerments is to give them to one, three, seven or no more than twenty-five disciples at a time. In other words, if he or she is giving the initiation to 3 people, he or she must visualize three separate mandalas. If he or she is giving the empowerment to twenty five people, they must visualize 25 separate and complete mandalas. For example, the Kalacakra Mandala in the full form has 648 deities, if I recall correctly. Each deity must be separately visualized for each person during that empowerment.

Even in a Jenang, where there is only a body, speech and mind "blessing" (i.e. the form of the deity, the mantra and introduction to the deity's wisdom continuum) the master must visualize everyone present as the form of the deity individually.

As you can now understand, in order to be a Vajramaster one must have extraordinary powers of samadhi.

An empowerment is something that arranges a profound dependent origination between someone's body, speech and mind and the three kāyas of the result. Therefore, it is not so that one does not receive the empowerment if one does not realize the nature of the mind.

An empowerment is first of all a method for inducing realization, for example, when Indrabhuti I attained Buddhahood by receiving the Guhyasamaja empowerment. Failing that, we have sadhanas, which is the method connected to the empowerment to produce realization. When we receive an empowerment, we agree to follow various samayas until we attain buddhahood. People who do not receive empowerments do not have those samayas.

JohnJ said:
The real empowerment is much more than a permission to practice various Sadhanas, it is an introduction to the natural state, and only if you do not understand that and remain in confusion should you seek out various Sadhana and yoga practices.

Malcolm wrote:
If you did not truly receive an empowerment because you failed to realize nature of your mind, you could not realize the three kāyas through the practice of sadhanas. Therefore, this idea is really not very correct at all.

JohnJ said:
In that way, most everyone who receives the empowerment is only receiving blessings, not the actual empowerment.

Malcolm wrote:
Nonsense. This represents a total misunderstanding of what an empowerment actually is.

JohnJ said:
My own understanding is that the recorded empowerments are a permission to practice and a receiving of some lineage blessings, since the vast majority who come or stay at home won't receive the empowerment in the way that Garchen Rinpoche (and many others) understand it.

Malcolm wrote:
There are a number of problems with this:

One: in any empowerment, there are three mandalas: the front created mandala, the vase mandala and the mandala of the teacher. The teacher arranges the descent of the wisdom being from the front created mandala onto the disciple after he creates each disciple as the form of the deity to be given. If you are not at the empowerment in some fashion during the time it is being given, there is no descent of the wisdom being.

Two: at the end of any empowerment, byin rlabs, or rje gnang there is the dissolution of the mandalas, i.e., the front created mandala, the vase mandala and the mandala of the teacher. One cannot receive initiation into a mandala that has been dissolved by the master. Once the vajramaster has concluded his or her activities, the empowerment is over.

Therefore, watching an empowerment later on is like watching a performance on PBS. It may be interesting, fascinating, and so on. But it is not live, you are not there, you are not participating, you are watching a show. You may be edified, but there is no stream of blessing because the mandala has already been switched off, as it were.

Further, there is the very real likelyhood that unsuitable people will choose to watch such performances on places like youtube resulting in many samaya problems.

Furthermore, regarding a "secret mantra guru", the Dzogchen Community has many secondary practices, mantras, protectors, etc.   Does this mean that the Direct Introduction, though it has no physical supports, constitutes the entirety of a "proper" empowerment for those who receive it, since there are many practices in the DC that are of the Vajrayana vehicle?

Malcolm wrote:
In the system of Dzogchen, the rig pa'i rtsal dbang aka direct introduction is considered to be the source of all empowerments. Therefore, from the perspective of the Dzogchen teachings, a direct introduction by a _qualified_ master alone is sufficient to ripen one as a student of Mantrayāna since the minds of all wisdom deities are the same; differing only in terms of mantra and appearances (for which thge khrid lung is then required).

On the other hand, it is not likely that many Sakyapa or Gelugpa lamas agree with this approach. Nevertheless, the system of Dzogchgen, following its own tantras, can support this approach with citations as well as reasonings.

Further, the system of Dzogchen considers the direct introduction to be an expanded, more experiential form of the fourth empowerment.

This however does not mean that other empowerments are not necessary. The Mutig Phrengwa tantra states that those with understanding require only introduction; the rest should receive the four empowerments in order. So it really depends on the capacity of the student.


JohnJ said:
In other words, ChNN rarely seems to give full Vajrayana empowerments, so would it still be correct to say that his teachings contain the essence of the 4 empowerments given in traditional HYT and that the many students and members of DC who follow his teachings have received Samaya, are expected to keep it perfectly, and have entered the Vajrayana?

There is no teaching of the Buddha in any authentic Buddhist tantra anywhere that someone who wishes to be ripened to practice Vajrayāna can be ripened merely by interacting with an inanimate object, which is what a recording or a book is in fact.

If someone wants a blessing, they should go visit a lama and get a pat on the head and a cord. If someone wishes to practice Vajrayāna, they should make the effort and sacrifice to go to where a teacher is present, receive an empowerment in a proper way, and if they cannot manage that much, then they should participate in a live online transmission of some kind.

It is not sufficient to watch some video of an empowerment and say " I will do this now and later get the real empowerment" and so on. This kind of thinking also has many faults mentioned in the tantras. We are after all discussing Vajrayāna, right?

Complaining it is impossible to travel, or that there are no teachers where one lives is the worst sort of lameass excuse one can give considering the enormous troubles the ancient Tibetans went through to bring the teachings to Tibet from India.

I am very sorry that I have to say this, but I have a responsibility to the Dharma. If people feel I am being critical of this or that teacher, that is not my intent.

Empowerments are not mystical transmissions, they are a very specific method with a precise dependent origination that requires the guru and the disciples' active, simultaneous, cooperative participation. The Buddha has no more power to bless a digital file with the potency to confer an empowerment (dbang skur), a blessing (sbyin rlabs), a permission (rjes gnang), a reading transmission or an ordination than the power to bless a book for the same purpose, so what need to mention any teacher living today? To believe otherwise to to fall under the influence of total proliferation.

Therefore, if someone asks me, I will always honestly tell them that it is impossible to receive any kind of Vajrayāna transmission from a recording of a prior event. People are of course free to disagree and that is between them and lower realms.

There are no siddhis without empowerment, 
just as there is no oil even if sand is pressed. 
Whoever proudly explains the tantras and citations
to those without empowerment,
both master and disciple go to hell
as soon as they die even if there are siddhis.

First of all, I would like to ask if any scholar around could give a precise differentiation on Gorampa and Rendawa's views on Madhyamika? As i do know that Gorampa's text is pretty much the standardised texts used in the seminaries, it would be good to actually have some basic information for everyone here before anyone else might make a decision to delve into Gorampa's text on Madhyamika.

Also, as I am currently reading Rongton's Commentary on Mulamadhyamikakarika (translated by Khenpo Ngawang Jorden, if i m not wrong), i would also appreciate if anyone could give an idea of how their differences in view are like? It's just for preliminary understanding.

Finally, if it is possible, would anyone be able to give a heuristic view of the Sakya's approach towards Maitreya's treatises (such as say, Uttaratantra)?  It would be good to hear a different pov from the gelug, kagyu and nyingma traditions, since there are many translations that have been published.

Gorampa found Rendawa a bit extreme in terms of Rendawa's polemics againt Jonang, but again, there is no real difference view.

As for Maitreya treatises Gorampa considers Abhisamayalamkara and Uttaratantra definitive, depending oninterpretation, and the other three provisional.

Gorampa's works are considered the gold standard for view in Sakya, apart from the five founders.

Yes, but the reason given for Cakrasamvara and Yogini being especially relevant these days is that the mandala of Cakrasamvara is still extant, open. It was also by far the most popular cycle in India, I suspect, because it had such a compelling narrative based on this idea.

Now to the matter of Gorampa. To this day, the refutations against Tsongkhapa's Madhyamika view by Gorampa Sonam Senge have not even been replied to by the great Gelugpa scholars of the past few hundred years. Instead, the defenders of Tsongkhapa have attacked the intellectual juniors of Gorampa such as Taktsang Lotsawa, Shakya Chogden and others (see Jeffrey Hopkins, Meditation on Emptiness). Also, Ngorchen Kunga Zangpo (the founder of Ngor), a contemporary, criticized Tsongkhapa's understanding of Tantra.

Please understand that these are not ramblings or sectarian expletives but are commonly known to all who have studied Madhyamika within the greater family of the Tibetan Buddhist Tradition. For the Sakya School Sakya Pandita is the definitive scholar and teacher. Gorampa Sonam Senge is the definitive scholar in explaining the difficult meanings of Sakya Pandita's works.

Many Gelugpa monasteries banned outright Gorampa's works from entering their premises. The works of some other Sakya lamas which criticized Tsongkhapa or seemed at odds with those views were banned from publication entirely within Tibet and were only preserved secretly and re-published openly from Bhutan after 1959.
Can anyone elaborate on whether the above are true/factual?

It is a contention found in the collected works of the Sakya master, Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen. There he states that according to his own Kagyu teacher, Milarepa never mentioned that Marpa directly encountered Naropa.

This is further confirmed by the fact that when Marpa met Atisha, Atisha informed Marpa that Naropa had already passed.

If Marpa did meet Naropa, it is likely he did so in a visionary encounter, similar to the encounter of Sachen Kunga Nyingpo with the Mahāsiddha Virupa in Tibet.

If there is a special form of Guru Pema Tho-threng-tsal with His own posture, gestures, costume, hand symbols, etc., I'd appreciate being steered to a picture or description.

It's the choice of the teachers. They could still do it as it has been done in the past, giving empowerment and teaching vajrayana meditation strictly to people who are actually going into retreat. There are lamas who still handle it that way.

conebeckham said:
Sure.  In Sakya's Lam Dre, where these instructions are found,  as I understand it, there's no "3 year retreat" requirement, but mainly a daily practice commitment.  I think there may sometimes be strict retreat requirement, too, though.

Malcolm wrote:
For Lamdre, no retreat commitment, generally as I understand things, these days people are allowed to attend the Tshogs bshad teachings without making a practice commitment apart from a short Hevajra sadhana. For Vajrayogini, yes there is a retreat if you take the some of the oral transmissions associated with the cycle, since it is easier to do.

This does not require retreat. It is a requirement from the moment one completes abhisheka.

Of course, this does not mean that it is practical. If anyone wonders why it seems that so few people get realization despite the promises made in the tantras, it is because people do not observe samaya carefully.

Sure.  The vast majority of those who have received abhisheka don't even do the NyenDrup, much less the post-session activities, though.  Not saying that's good....it's just the way it is.

Not even doing the Nyendrup, how can people talk about the path of passion, much less Karmamudra?

Malcolm wrote:
If you are practicing the sadhana, whether you have done any retreat or not, you should be practicing the yoga of passion if you have a partner. Therefore, that partner better be a fellow practitioner, no?

Malcolm, I've not read much about the three forms of VY given in Sakya--I know Naro Khacho is by far the main practice, but there's also Indra Dakini and Maitri Dakini.  Do these forms also stem from the Chakrasamvara practices?

Malcolm wrote:
Yes.

conebeckham said:
Somewhat tangentially, Kamtsang Chakrasamvara is also derived from the 3 main traditions --Luipa's tradition is primary, but there are elements of Ghantapada and Nagpopa's traditions, as well.

Of course, since they derive from Naropa.

The Vajrayogini that HH Sakya Trizin just gave in New York actually had no prerequisites at al.

Malcolm wrote:
This was a two day major empowerment. Therefore, it requires no previous empowerment, it is self contained.

In general, there were three traditions that came through Naropa to Sakya: Luipa, Krishnapa and Ghantapada's Cakrasamvara traditions. Therefore, it is considered that one should have received one, two or all three of these empowerments as a prerequisite for Naro Khachod, because the completion stage practice of Naro Khacho combines all three traditions into the their essentials, in addition its own special features.

However, the Vajrayogini Empowerment comes from Mahasiddha Virupa, and what is not widely known is that his main deity for 24 years was actually Vajrayogini.

I would be interested to see some citations from the Tantras

Malcolm wrote:
The Hevajra tantra and its commentaries describe in detail who can be used as a mudra, and how one goes about finding such a person and training her. One is not allowed to use this person as a mudra until one has granted her abhisheka and given her substantial training in the creation stage.

This stuff is not a joke, and actually, we ought not be discussing it in a public forum.

So, let me get this...

A person takes an empowerment, is 'anointed' and enthroned as a Deity,
receives all four empowerments connected with body, speech and mind and
has samaya to maintain pure vision is somehow allowed to refer to any
external phenomenon as 'ordinary'? Where is the mandala?
Where are the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, 12th, 13th, and 14th root samayas?

There is nothing ordinary under the sun, for one who is actually practicing
authentically and sincerely (without duplicity).


Malcolm wrote:
If a practitioner uses an unripened mudra, blessing her "space" as it were, this is a root downfall because it breaches the 7th root samaya. If one imagines this person mentally as the vidyā (rig ma) it is the first branch downfall. The latter refers to the yoga of passion which is the one of the off-time yogas of a lay person.

The Maoists are one faction among many with an interest in taking leadership in Nepal.  Participatory democracy is like that--people try to take control of the country.
