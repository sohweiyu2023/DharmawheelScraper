Yeshe did his best. He offered his understanding based on his experience.  So, like the Buddha’s teaching, it should be examined the same way a goldsmith examines gold. If you disagree, you arguing for a position based on faith rather than reason.

This is not sense withdrawal. This is a function of the radiance of rig pa subsiding naturally.

Sense withdrawal (so so bsdus pa, pratyāhara) is the completely opposite of Dzogchen practice in all forms.

The point I've been trying to make is that one cannot equate the semzins of Dzogchen Nyinthig with other kinds of semzins. Also, ChNN made this point many times. Referring to this as mere triumphalism is wrong. 

If one wants to understand why common śamatha will not expose rig pa, and why exposing rig pa supercedes the need for developing śamatha in the classical way there are two things one must understand: First, from a Dzogchen point of view, śamatha and vipaśyanā are already present when rig pa is nakedly exposed, in other words, they are intrinsic to instant presence. Second, when one's calm state is based on mental objects, as soon as one abandons that object, posture, gaze, and so on, that calm state is also lost. On the other hand, once rig pa is nakedly exposed, one never loses that. 

All I can do is recommend that you study the introductory section to chapter 10 of the Treasury of the Dharmadhātu Autocommentary where Longchenpa clearly and precisely distinguishes four differences between the calm state with and without support (including all completion stage practices of the lower tantras), which he refers to as meditation (bsgoms, bhāvana) and concentration (bsam gtan, dhyāna), which he characterizes as the special feature of Dzogchen (as does ChNN in his trekcho commmentary), in which bliss, clarity, and nonconceptuality are innate to the naturally occurring (rang babs), concentration which in DC lingo, characterizes instant presence/contemplation.

Yes, this how optics are understood at the material level in modern times. 

But when we talk about sounds, lights, and rays in Dzogchen teachings, we are not actually talking about sound waves, or photons and their effects. 

Sound is the intrinsic sound of rig pa. Light is the intrinsic light of rig pa, and rays are the intrinsic rays of rig pa. In short, we are talking about phenomena that belong to consciousness, not to matter.

The experience of color here is more to with phenomenology than physics.

From what I gathered, he made reference to how his father explained elements and so on from the perspective of Tibetan Medicine. He by contrast explains things through the model of the world he is more familiar with. Further, from what I gathered, he understood that many people understood things from this more traditional framework, but he felt that people ought to understand things also from a modern scientific perspective. So I imagine he is trying to replace/supplement Abhidharma with classical and quantum physics. I am not sure that works, but he seems to me to think people in the DC are scientifically illiterate. I can see why he thinks this. 

With regard to light, the optical theory presented in the teachings does not correspond at all to the optical theory of Newton. It is perhaps a little closer to Goethe's ideas about color and light.

But even more so, it is consistent with Empedocles theory, which are part of the so-called emission theory of vision when it comes to pristine consciousness.

The difference is that sems 'dzin, etc., practices are designed to expose rig pa nakedly on the basis of the experience of direct introduction. Please tell me where in sutra there is such a distinction? 

It seems to me you are just objecting to the fact that I am contradicting BAW's assertion that it is necessary develop perfect śamatha before practicing Dzogchen. 

According to you it appears that direct introduction isn't necessary and Longchenpa is wrong when he says:

Therefore, since there is no basis for confidence in the śamatha and vipaśyanā of the repose of a calm mind, [the path of the essential core] is superior. 

If you like, you can check the passage in Barron's translation, on pg. 224.

I just want to add, this idea is found in Abhidharma and Dzogchen. This universe forms because of the karma of sentient beings. The latent traces in our minds cause the wind mandala to stir, causing heat, resulting in condensation of water, which finally gives rise to earth when that cools and hardens. For example, this is the wind and fire mandalas are in the lower part of our body, and the water and earth elements are in the upper part of our body.

There is, in the sgra thal gyur commentary, an explanation of how our delusion causes the formation of subtle and gross particles of matter out of the light of pristine consciousness. 

The light we see in thogal is a representation ('dra), it is not the basis (gzhi). 

As for his remark about the brain, when we are in the bardo of dharmatā we have seven times more clarity because we also only have a mind-made body. 

Sound, light, and rays is not on a gross level, but a subtle level.

Again, this precisely makes my point--one will never discover this state in ordinary śamatha, since there is no method to expose rig pa nakedly. 

In both cases, this is post-empowerment, direct introduction, etc. I am referring the to common-sutra style śamatha BAW insists people must perfect before moving on to trekcho.

I suggest you just read chapter 10 of the Autocommentary of the Treasury of Dharmadhātu, and compare it with ChNN's longsal trekcho commentary. That will clear it up for you. We can use mind to go beyond mind, in Dzogchen we employ the rig pa as the path.

Having briefly looked over the text (albeit without instruction), prior to the stages of sems 'dzin with, without characteristics, and the introduction to reality, there is refuge through guru yoga. The practice of guru yoga alone means we are not in Kansas anymore. 

But the instructions are nothing like the common śamatha and vipaśyanā we see in the Lam Rim tradition at all. For example, in the section on sems 'dzins with signs, the text explicitly enjoins one to request empowerment from a special guru, etc. There are many differences and instructions which one sees in other Dzogchen traditions, metaphors like remaining like a tortoise in a bowl, etc. So I dont think you can hold these Atri instructions to resemble anything like common śamatha and vipaśyanā.

They don’t, since common shamatha and vipashyana will never expose rig pa nakedly. If rig pa isn’t exposed nakedly, no matter what you call it, it isn’t dzogchen.
