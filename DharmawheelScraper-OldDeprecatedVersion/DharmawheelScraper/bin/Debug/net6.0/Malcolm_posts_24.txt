When one has direct knowledge of one's own state, and sees that it is the solution to the existential problem for suffering, one automatically feels compassion for those that do not have this knowledge. It is just like someone who has fire seeing how the lives of those who do not know how to make fire will be immeasurably improved if they learned how to make fire. 

The compassion of the basis however, is something else entirely. It is related to the nirmanakāya. Samantabhadra does not have a mind, per se. The activity of the buddhas is beyond thought, karma, etc. It is like the action of a wishfulfilling gem.

There was something featureless yet complete, born before heaven and earth; Silent—amorphous—it stood alone and unchanging. We may regard it as the mother of heaven and earth. Not knowing its name, I style it the "Way."[2]

The Way gave birth to unity, Unity gave birth to duality, Duality gave birth to trinity, Trinity gave birth to the myriad creatures. The myriad creatures bear yin on their back and embrace yang in their bosoms. They neutralize these vapors and thereby achieve harmony.[3]

na ca paṇḍakasya dharmaṃ deśayati, na ca tena sārdhaṃ saṃstavaṃ karoti

Do not teach Dharma to paṇḍakas, nor should one associate with them.

Well, the Lotus Sūtra actually says that buddhas do see a substantially different conventional reality than we do:

When sentient beings see themselves
Amidst a conflagration
At the end of a kalpa,
It is in fact my tranquil land,
Always full of devas and humans.
All the gardens and palaces
Are adorned with various gems...
Although my Pure Land never decays,
The sentient beings see it as ravaged by fire
And torn with anxiety and distress;
They believe it is filled with these things.

Relative truth is the deluded perception of sentient beings, this is basic to its definition. 

Maintaining that buddhas perceive relative truths is the same as maintaining they are deluded. 

The omniscience of the buddha has two components, a buddha is omniscience about all that there is and they are omniscience about every aspect, but it is not the case that they perceive the world the way we do, because if they did, the consequence would be that the buddhas would be deluded.

There is a real problem with this translation you are referencing, it is just not accurate. I cannot evaluate the Chinese, but the passage you cite actually says:

cariṃ cariṃ jāniya nityakālaṃ 
vadāmi sattvāna tathā tathāham| 
kathaṃ nu bodhāvupanāmayeyaṃ 
katha buddhadharmāṇa bhaveyu lābhinaḥ|

Always knowing their practices,
I likewise teach sentient beings
in order to place them by all means in awakening,
and that by all means they attain the buddhadharmas. 

Here, buddhadharmas refers to the 18 unshared qualities, among others, that buddhas uniquely possess. It is a little hard therefore to accept imperatives such as:

kulaputrāḥ, abhiśraddadhadhvaṃ tathāgatasya bhūtāṃ vācaṃ vyāharataḥ

Sons of a good family, have faith and confidence in my words, the Tathāgata!

Not because what the Tathāgata says is false, but because so many translations of his words are blatantly flawed.

Now to the real question: What does a buddha know, and when did he know it?

This is what it says:

Turning over evils, there is virtue supporting them, like inside bamboo there being the nature of fire. It is not yet the object of fire, which is why it exists but does not burn. When meeting with conditions the phenomenon comes to exist, and then it can burn things.

It does not reflect the interpretation you are sharing.

For example, there is a passage where Garab Dorje asks, "How will the bonfire of pristine consciousness (jñāna) burn without the fuel of afflictions?" But this does not mean a buddha possesses afflictions. In a buddha, even the fire of pristine consciousness has gone out since there is nothing further for a buddha to purify, to know or to do with respect to a path and all their actions are spontaneous like the rewards that come from possessing a wishful fulfilling gem. 

Is this ambiguous interpretation you give coming from the Ziporyn fellow's books?

When I started out studying Buddhadharma many years ago, lacking any experience, I relied on śabdaprāmaṇā primarily, valid knowledge based on scripture. As I learned more, I increasingly  began to rely more on anumāna, inference. These days, I primarily rely on pratyakṣa, direct perception. 

When one relies on direct perception, there is no need for inference, what need to mention scripture? Valid knowledge derived from scripture is the weakest, it must be supported with inference (i.e. reasoning, with is inference for others). Reasoning is stronger than scripture but weaker than direct perception. 

Any true expression of Buddhadharma wants to move people in the direction of direct perception. Over reliance on scripture without accompanying reasoning causes unsound Buddhist dogmatism.

It is very easy to delude oneself with this kind of view. It is easy to kid oneself. 

Of course, if one is perfectly honest with oneself, one will recognize when desire is desire, ignorance is ignorance, and hatred is hatred, and not an expression of anything other than a cause of karma which in turn results only in suffering. 

Now if one knows and recognizes desire as desire when desire arises, and so on, then maybe one can say that at that moment bodhi begins to dawn every so slightly if that desire etc., does not lead to action which in turn leads inevitably to suffering. But if one excuses desire, etc., as bodhi and merely continues to inflame the three poisons, soon one will be joining all the buddhas in hell who don't know they are buddhas. Why, because they, like oneself, did not recognize the three poisons as the three poisons.

The problem with forums like these is that it is easy to have a view in one's mouth.

No, that consequence is an exaggeration. Mistaken ideas about the path are impediments to awakening, but they are not impediments to gathering accumulations, devotion, and so on, and gradually, one will overcome such mistakes, especially if one learns to train in ultimate bodhicitta, śamatha and vipaśyāna. 

However, the force of generating the initial thought of awakening are so powerful that as Santideva says:

The moment bodhicitta arises,
the wretched one confined in the prison of samsara
is called “a child of the Sugatas,” 
and worldly gods and people offer homage. 

And the Avatamska states:

Child of good lineage, bodhicitta is the seed of Dharma of the Buddhas. 

The Vīradattagṛhapatiparipṛcchā states:

Whatever is the merit of bodhicitta, 
if that existed in form,
it would more than fill
all of  space.

The afflictions that cause you, a buddha, to take rebirth in samsara.

The point was that you cited a passage from a sūtra which referred to āryabodhisattvas. But there are other bodhisattvas on the paths of application and accumulation, below the path of seeing. I was pointing out simply that any practice one with Mahāyāna motivation becomes a Mahāyāna practice, for example, if one ordains as a bhikṣu with the intent to attain buddhahood to liberate all sentient beings, that ordination becomes a Mahāyāna practice by definition. The true difference between Hinayāna and Mahāyāna is whether or not one practices Dharma with the intent to attain anuttarasamyaksambodhi or not.

That is not the case.

Dzogchen is a Mahāyāna system. Within Mahāyāna it belongs to uncommon Mahāyāna secret mantra. Within uncommon secret mantra, it belongs to the inner tantras. 

The main difference between Dzogchen and other systems of Buddhadharma is that other systems of Buddhadharma practice are based on mind. Dzogchen practice, from the beginning, is based on jñāna. But if someone is really curious about what that means, they have to go and find some guru who is willing to instruct them. 

It is not, an elitist system, however. Vajrahe, emanation of Śākyamuni and first human teacher of Dzogchen said, "if there is one student who is not interested in Dzogchen, that is too many. If there are 100 students interested in Dzogchen, that is too few."

Many people who wish to follow Buddhadharma do not wish to have a close relationship with a guru. This is perfectly fine. There are all kinds of strands of Buddhadharma where the relationship with a teacher is not so vital. For people who are not interested in that kind of relationship with a teacher there are all kinds of practices. 

But anyone who wishes to follow Dzogchen teachings must have a guru. There is no other way.

I once speculated that Mahāyāna Sūtras were visionary revelations, but not records of actual historical events. 

However, clinging to the events described in the Lotus Sūtra, or any other Mahāyāna Sūtra, opens up an uncomfortable can of worms for those who literally believe in the text of the sūtra in question. 

For example, have you ever seen Vulture's Peak where the Buddha is said to have taught this sūtra? 




How are 12,000 arhat bhikṣus supposed to fit there? Let alone, 2,000 extra, 6,000 nuns, and 80,000 bodhisattvas? Were they all levitating in space around the mountain?

It should go without saying, but in Vajrayāna, the principle that women can attain samyaksambodhi in female form is axiomatic and exemplified in the story of Āryatārā. She is an example of a women who vowed to attain samyaksambodhi in female form and then did so.

There are of course differences in the presentations, but it is incorrect to state that the four foundations of mindfulness are absent in Mahāyāna, which was your contention above. 

For example, the Akṣayamatinirdeśa explains:

Furthermore, the meditation of the four close placement of mindfulness of bodhisattvas is not concluded. If it is what are the four, it is like this: the close placement of mindfulness of scrutinizing the body in the body, the close placement of mindfulness of scrutinizing sensations in sensations, the close placement of mindfulness of scrutinizing the mind in the mind, and the close placement of mindfulness of scrutinizing the phenomena in the phenomena. What is the bodhisattva's close placement of mindfulness of scrutinizing the body in the body? If asked about the bodhisattva's scrutinizing and dwelling on the body in the body, it is scrutinizing and dwelling on his own and other bodies: considering the prior limit of the body, considered the posterior limit of the body, also considering how the body arises in the present, that is, "Alas, the body arises from error, is formed by cause and condition, lacks sensation, lacks agency, lacks an owner, is not property, and is produced by causes and conditions. In this way, for example, it is like the grass outside, a branch of a tree, its sap, and a forest, these are all produced by cause and condition, lack sensation, lack agency, lack an owner, and are not property. In the same way, this body is like a grass, a branch of a tree, sap, a forest, trees, walls, or an optical illusion. That which is grasped by aggregates, sense elements, and sense bases lacks sensation, lacks agency, lacks an owner, is not property, and it empty of phenomena of I, mine, permanence, stability, perpetuity, immovability, invulnerability, and immutablity. There is nothing that to be taken as mine in this body, however, this body that lacks an essential self will attain the essence, samyaksambodhi [...]

It continues for a couple of pages — the point being is that it is incorrect to assert that Mahāyāna lacks the four foundations of mindfulness.

These examples you provide do not negate Dharmakīrti's proof. Why? You have selected the wrong negandum. 

We are talking about rebirth, not sense consciousness. In other words we are talking about the link, consciousness, not the link, sensation. 

Dharmakīrti will happily agree that a a direct perception of blue requires a blue object. However, from where does the mind arise at the first moment of conception? If it is restricted to this life, your examples fail because at this point there are no senses and no sense organs. There is only namarūpa. The point Dharnakīrti is driving home is that one has to decide if consciousness is something that arises from the body or not. If consciousness is only something that arises through physical contact, then this also eliminates mental consciousness, since a mental consciousness by definition takes a mental object as a sense base and arises on the basis of contact with that. 

If we follow your example, there are only ten ayatanas, fifteen dhātus, or one skandha. 

If however one decides that the consciousness is not produced by the body, then consciousness requires another cause that is not the body.

I did not say it was his full argument. I stated it was his heuristic. 

Basically, the argument that mind cannot arise from matter is that mind cannot arise from the four elements, since matter and mind are different kinds of substance (dravya), and just as material entities of different continua cannot arise from one another, i.e. corn cannot grow from wheat seeds, likewise, matter cannot produce mind nor can mind arise from matter. 

When the Buddha grouped phenomena, he did so into six distinct dhātus; solids (earth), liquids (water), gases (air), heat (fire), space, and consciousness. 

Four of these dhātus are material, two are nonmaterial. They are all nevertheless "substances." (dravya).

The old Dharmakīrti heuristic

All conditioned things have causes. Mind, being conditioned, has a cause. If mind has a material cause it must come from the body. 
If mind does not have a material cause it must have a nonmaterial cause. 
If the mind has a nonmaterial cause it must be conditioned, since the unconditioned has no causal action. 
The only nonmaterial thing that can cause mind is mind. 
Since mind streams are unique and independent, this present moment of mind must have as its cause a previous moment of mind. 
Since the mind does not arise from matter, then, this life's first moment of consciousness at conception must have its cause in a previous moment of mind prior to conception. 

Some people instinctively accept rebirth. For them, this chain of reasoning is superfluous.

In terms of ascertaining rebirth in direct perception, it is necessary to develop the five abhijñas so that one can personally verify rebirth through one's own experience. Even those these abhijñās are mundane, they are not ordinary in the sense that while they are faculties anyone can develop through cultivating samadhi, few people do. 

If one wishes to even start practicing Buddhadharma, it is a good idea to have an understanding of the what existential problem Buddhism presents (affliction-driven rebirth) and its solution to that problem. 

People who do not accept rebirth are utterly wasting their time studying and practicing Buddhadharma. There is no point to it. If you want to be a "better" person, or have less anxiety, etc., you don't need Buddhism at all.

Yes, blo gtad ling bskyur is a real Tibetan term. It means "complete trust." One has to have complete trust in one's guru. For example, I completely trust ChNN. But I do not think this trust is something which is given as a concept. It is something which takes time to develop. 

The issue before us is whether or not a guru can violate that trust. Some literalists will say no, it is not possible. I think it is possible and happens quite a bit, actually, especially to women. Then there is the the sticky point of when one has genuinely entered into a true relationship with a guru, at what point does this occur? I don't think this necessarily happens just because one has received an empowerment.

One cannot attain buddhahood if one is born in any other condition— hell being, preta, animal, asura, or deva, or even a human being who is lacking the eight freedoms and ten endowments. 

So for example, in the nāgā princess story of which you are so fond, the nāgā princess was already a ārya bodhisattva abiding on the bodhisattva stages. 

With respect to Avalokiteśvara (Kanon), of course Avalokiteśvara can manifest in any of the six lokas and bring solace to sentient beings in those realms. But no one can liberate anyone from any thing. Liberation is won by one's own effort alone. No one can practice the path for you.

Abhidhamma is indeed held to be direct Buddhavacana.

Abhidharma is not, which is why we has a system of tenets. 

Abhidharma is held to be the advanced discussion of arhats concerning the detailed and advanced points of the Agamas, Vinaya, etc. In Abhidharma, it is generally considered that the Sautrantikas are more authoritative than the Vaibhashikas because the Sautrantikas hold up Vaibhashika tenets to scrutiny viz. the Agamic sūtras. 

Even so, "Abhidharma" still means "higher dharma." Everyone should study Abhidharma. If they did, it would end a lot of senseless conversations and prevent myriads more.

What HHST says is perfect, but your citing it here is beside the point, because he is not contradicting Sakya Pandita, whose small commentary on samaya is quoted universally by everyone in all four schools as authoritative. 

In order to have committed the downfall of criticizing a qualified master, one has to go the extreme mentioned by Sapan. The point of mentioning these things is not to encourage people to go around criticizing their gurus. The point of mentioned such things is to relieve people of the anxiety of thinking they have broken samaya merely because they may have uttered a critical word about their gurus in an unguarded moment of affliction. Sapan makes it very clear that such afflicted speech does not constitute a root downfall. A root downfall only occurs if one denies that one's qualified guru is actually a qualified guru. That is what "criticism" (brnyas pa) means. 

Now then, in these kinds of discussions is best to keep ones remarks relevant to the topic at hand. 

Secondly, In fact, there is no actual samaya to regard to one's root guru as a perfect being (though it is recommended that it is best if one can). Good thing too, since if there was such a samaya, no one would be able to keep samaya at all. 

And of course, since in reality virtually no one can maintain this kind of pure conceptual perception, we do not, in general, practice guru yoga with the ordinary form of our guru, we visualize them in the form of a Buddha such as Vajradhāra, or Guru Rinpoche, etc. Why? Because it is recognized maintaining pure perception of our root guru is in fact difficult, and not easy, and for beginners, impossible. 

Also, in the Nyingma tradition, minor criticism of one's root guru does not result in a downfall either. Merely having an afflictive verbal response to something the guru does or says simply does not qualify as a downfall. 

Finally, the whole point of practicing Dharma is to overcome afflictions. Sometimes our gurus behave strangely. Of course we have to learn to be flexible and not immediately decide we have made a poor choice in gurus and move on. Nevertheless, if while sincerely following a teacher we are overcome with affliction and voice our critical displeasure at this or that thing our guru does, this does not constitute a downfall; and whatever verbal nonvirtue we may have incurred as a result of some minor criticism we may make of our guru is easily rectified —— this is why we have so many methods of purification, from Vajrasattva to the completion stage (yes, this is the best way to purify all downfalls —&nbsp;look it up). 

So, when you experience that knee-jerk reflex to go off on something you see that I have said on the forum, think twice about what I have said before you go posting irrelevant rebuttals to things I have not said.

There is a huge tendency in Vajrayāna to encourage sycophancy and dependence amongst disciples. Many people do not understand that there are limits to the guru's authority. For example, Sapan also states with great clarity:

If he does not teach according to the words of the Buddha,
even if he is one’s guru, one should remain indifferent.

This is not to say that we can get anywhere on our own in the Buddhist path, The Tattvāvatāra states:

The all-knowing one praises reliance on a guru,
not the independence of a disciple. 
A blind person is not independent, 
unable to climb a mountain.

Nevertheless, we must temper our understaing of the need to rely on a qualified master with common sense, so we do not wind up creating Buddhist cults which merely keep people imprisoned cages that seem like Dharma but are actually just clever prisons.

Sakya Pandita states:

"Criticism" does not refer to criticizing the master out of some slight anger. "Criticism" refers to statements such as "This master is evil, with corrupted discipline, who does not act according to the Dharma, and so on. Such criticisms result in a downfall.

In other words, in order to commit this downfall, one has to make extremely negative statements about a qualified master from whom one has received teachings. Minor criticisms do not constitute a downfall.

Content:
It is interesting, but there are some funny mistakes like this footnote:


For example, see Norbu and Lipman 2001, p. 65, and p.121, lines 124-127. This passage quotes an unnamed teacher as stating that “pure symbolic consumption is also bodhicitta”: brda can yang dag len pa’ang byang chub yin zhes ston pas gsung. This probably denotes the ritual consumption of semen in the practice of sbyor ba. The same passage also refers to the Three Samādhi (ting ’dzin gsum po), and the Great Seal of the Dharma (chos kyi phyag rgya chen po).

In fact the line reads:

Furthermore, since the teacher has declared that awakening can be correctly grasped with a symbol,
in that case, this is the basis of the meditation that generates awakened mind. 
After the three samadhis are stable and after binding the three symbolic mudras, 
generate the mind as the great dharmamudra and meditate the recitation of the essence [mantra].

Mipham's comment, based on the commentary found in the Tengyur, states:

If it is asked, “What is the method for realizing the definitive meaning through the indirect method?,” since nonactivity is illustrated with the activity of fabricated efforts, like pointing at the moon with a finger, also awakened mind correctly grasped through a symbol will accomplish awakening because the Bhagavan Buddha, the teacher of devas and humans, has declared that it is “great awakening.” Any unfortunate one who conceptualizes entities should make efforts in the indirect method of realization.
 
In that case, this which is to be explained is the basis or cause of the meditation that generates ultimate awakened mind itself. If it is asked what that is, it is samadhi and mudra. 

Now then, through the power of cultivating the three samadhis of suchness, universal illumination and the cause, [14/a] one will be stable, and not carried away by negative conditions. After the meditation of binding the three symbolic mudras of buddhahood— the body (mahāmudra), the mind (samaya mudra), and the activities (karmamudra)—generate the mind as the great dharmamudra (the symbol of speech). One should then meditate the recitation of the essence mantra.

If one meditates generating the thought that the samadhis and the mudras are dharmatā and therefore are not different, the ultimate awakened mind will arise. If one actualizes the meditation, one realizes that all phenomena do not exist apart from one’s mind. The accumulations are gathered and obscurations are purified because of that meditation. One becomes realized because one’s continuum is blessed by the deity of pristine consciousness. 

I just don't see any ritual consumption of semen in this text, damn!

Tulkus are something relative, it is a social phenomena. When a Dzogchen practitioner passes away, each grade of practitioner will have a given number of emanations, will remain in the bardo of dharmatā for a set length of time and so on. It is not necessary to recognize all these emanations as tulkus. Ordinary people are also recognized as tulkus. Actually, all of us are tulkus.

That is a complete misrepresentation. Sinitic Buddhism is just fine. But just as I have doubts about interpretations of Dharma that I consider excessively parochial in Tibetan Buddhism, I have similar doubts about interpretations of Dharma found in Sinitic Buddhism that seen excessively parochial to me. 

In particular, I find it fascinating that Chinese Buddhists latched onto individual sūtras like the Saddhamapundarika and the Avatamska and formulated whole systems of thought out of them, a trend which is notably absent in Indian Buddhism. 

If Huayen [Kegon] was a living school I am sure that a lively conversation would ensue with them as well.

At base, the most interesting phenomena in these discussions is the unwillingness of my fellow discussants to simply admit that their acceptance or rejection of Lotus Buddhism for example, is based on very little else other than their own proclivity towards it. Instead they try to argue their adherence to this school of Buddhism is based on some objective measure which can be found in the words of the Lotus Sūtra, forgetting the only reason they believe this is that they chose to believe it and nothing more.

I for one am certainly willing to admit that my choice of practice schools is based on my own personal proclivities, and that I accept what I accept based purely on my own authority and I do not pretend that my biases are enshrined in the words of the Buddha.

That is the only Indic commentary that has survived. And, he is definitely not Chinese. There are semantic markers in Tibetan that distinguish translations from Sanskrit and translations from Chinese. This is very clear, for example, when you compare the Tibetan translation of the Nirvana Sūtra from Sanskrit and Chinese respectively. 

Themes from the Saddharmapundarika Sūtra are cited quite frequently in Indian and Tibetan Buddhist sources. In other words, there are more sources than that commentary, and in fact, the way those sources use the Saddharmapundarika indicates what Indians found important and what they ignored. They cared little for historical assertions, for example, the three turnings of the wheel mentioned in the Samdhinirmocana, and tended to focus on that which was of doctrinal significance. Granted, this perspective is an exegetical perspective, and apart from inscriptions, we have almost no evidence of how these sūtras might have actually been treated in devotional communities in India.

Quite frankly, the Chinese were a highly literate culture when they encountered Buddhadharma. They had already a very refined sense of literary aesthetics. Sutras like the PP Sūtras, the Yogacara Sūtras, are very Abhidharmic in their scope and language, and really, have very little narrative value. It is telling that Pramāṇa (aka Buddhist epistemology) never got off the ground in China. It is equally telling that such classics as the Maitreyan synthesis and so on were largely ignored in China, something really only Yogacara geeks like Xuantsang were into. It is not surprising therefore that the two sūtras with the grandest narrative structures, the Lotus and the Avatamska, came to be the two dominant and competing exegetical schools in China. 

What strikes me repeatedly in these exchanges is how much you all value a great masterpiece of world literature without having much care for its place in the society that generated it, how little you care about its original context and range of influence. 

It strikes me that for you, Buddhism begins in China in the fifth century, and anything that does not fit in with Tientai historiography is just flat out ignored.

The arrival of Bodhidharma to China corresponds with an increased incorporation of anatomical and medical understandings of the relation of the human body to practice in India. Depending on when you think he arrived, he arrived either slightly before or slightly after the fall of the Gupta empire. It must be the case that he carried these kinds of instructions with him, though whether they were passed on in any significant way is anybody's guess. 

In any case, sūtras like the Suvarnaprabhaṣa, the Nandagarbhavikranti, etc., exhibit a sophisticated knowledge of Ayurveda, and so on. As we know, these trends reached their apogee in the 10th century when Indian Vajrayāna grounded its entire practice in a specific understanding of the physiology and anatomy of the body. However, we also see an approach to this understanding in the so-called lower tantras which date to the 7th century. 

In general, Mahayāna yogis began to incorporate these kinds of understandings into their practice, which in my opinion was first promulgated in the form of upadeśas to close disciples. Perhaps these Indian techniques never gained the popularity they experienced in India and the Himalayas because China already had a sophisticated medical system with an elaborate and functional anatomy and physiology. In any case, after the fall of the Gupta, In India we see the evolution of body-based systems of practice and trend away from the intellectual edifices of Madhyamaka and Yogacara, a trend away from intellectual analysis towards yogic experience. It is obvious to me, that this fusion of yogic praxis with local understandings of anatomy and physiology becomes a more prominent feature of Mahāyana practice as time moves on. For example, in Tibet, the vast intellectual edifice of Dzogchen Upadesha teachings (as opposed to the mind series and space series) serves merely to articulate the technical principles of the body-based experience which is crucial in Dzogchen Upadesha teachings, and without which there is no Dzogchen Upadesha practice to speak of. My point is that there is no reason to assume that Chan and Zen practice are not similarly influenced by body-based yogic experience, and that there has been very little translated yet into English that really speaks to such things —&nbsp;since academic scholars are generally more interested in intellectual analysis, even when they dress it up in poetry.

This is not particularly interesting. All conditioned things are simultaneously causes and effects. 

Moreover, there is in Abhidharma a simple concept called karana-hetu. It simply means that everything is a cause of everything other thing apart from itself. It is one of the six causes. 

Moreover, there are four conditions, the causal condition, the dominant condition (aka karana-hetu), the object condition and the immediately antecedent and simultaneous condition. 

Nāgārjuna systematically dismantles these one by one. Thus, arising from conditions is merely a convention and does not signify anything real.

I am afraid you don't understand Rinpoche's point. His point is very simple. It is easy to have misconceptions about thogal teachings if you read them without proper preparation. We see this all the time —&nbsp;people have wild fantasies based on so called "Dzogchen" cosmology, that is, how appearance of the basis arise from the basis, and what "basis" actually means. 

When you have misconceptions about Dzogchen teachings, you will block your realization.

Now then, ChNN never said to anyone, "You cannot read thogal texts until you receive thogal teachings from me." He said, "You should not read thogal texts until you have received thogal teachings in a proper way."

Moreover, the presentation of the lamps is markedly different in these two different Dzogchen traditions, their names are different, and so on. Thus, while their meaning is the same, goal is the same, etc., they are different traditions and need to be respected. Just because you have received Bonpo teachings on Dzogchen does not mean you have the proper transmission to read any Buddhist thogal text. There are important differences in the two traditions based on terminology, and so on. Basically, if you want their transmissions, you must go out and seek them from someone qualified to give them, but not just start reading books because after all, we have the first amendment.

Title: Re: Yes, you need a teacher.

Of course there are. There are reams of passages that define the qualities of a kayānamitra. The terms guru and kalayānamitra are intimately connected in Mahāyāna Sūtras. 

For example, the Ratnānanta Sūtra says of the virtuous mentor:

One must have strong devotion for the virtuous mentor. They are never satisfied in seeking the Dharma. They have much hearing, and are diligent. They pure investigation into the treatises. They train in discernment. They train in discerning philosophical positions. They are expert in rites. One should be devoted to the guru. One must never deny the guru. One must never violate the word of the guru.


The Akṣayamati-nirdeśa states:

Those virtuous mentors are without pride, and they should be held as dear as gurus, they should be held as dear as the teacher.

The Bodhisattva-piṭaka Sūtra states:

Since I pleased a master,
I have attained freedom and endowments.
Since I relinquished evil companions,
I have found a virtuous mentor.
In order to attain awakening,
I have disregarded my body and my life.
In order to attain the awakening of a buddha,
with thoughts of faith
for the master, the guru, the object of offering,
I always behaved with respect. 

And:

One should circumambulate all gurus
thereby, merit is strengthened and one's brilliance increases.

The Buddha-saṅgīti Sūtra states:

Bodhisattvas on the second bodhisattva bhumi think of eight Dharmas in their minds. If it is asked what are the eight, they are as follows: 1) they have pure discipline, 2) they are grateful and thoughtful, 3) they dwell in power of patience, 4) they are joyful and they bow, 5) they never abandon all sentient beings, 6) they are unconfused about great compassion, 7) they are devoted to the guru and consider them the Teacher (i.e. Buddha), and 8) they are diligent in the perfections. 

The Suvikrāntacinta-devaputra-paripṛcchā states:

Devaputra, if a bodhisattva is endowed with four Dharmas they will be a master for all. What are these four? Absence of pride, devotion to the guru, conscientiousness, and strong aspiration.

The Śatasāhasrikā-prajñāpāramitā states:

Rely upon, attend, serve, and regard those virtuous mentors as gurus.

The term used in my translation, virtuous mentor, is a translation of kalyāṇamitra. You can see from the sūtras I cited above, there is no question but that in Mahāyāna one is supposed to serve this person with respect commensurate with their kindness in teaching the Dharma. Examples of this can found in the PP Sūtras, where Sadaprarudita, despite having visions of Tathāgatas, still endeavors to find a human teacher, the bodhisattva Dharmodgata, who can teach him the perfection of wisdom.

In Hinayāna, novice bhikṣus are supposed to serve a senior teacher for ten years.

Those who have not known, seen, penetrated, realized, or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction in others that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed &amp; pursued, gains a footing in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation; whereas those who have known, seen, penetrated, realized, &amp; attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed &amp; pursued, gains a footing in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation."

This is straight from Mahāyāna Sūtra, and more than one. 

Lankāvatāra Sūtra states:

[Those in] the divine palace of Akaniṣṭha
are free from all misdeeds,
always endowed with nonconceptuality, 
free from the arising of mind and mental factors, 
having obtained the powers and the faculty of clairvoyance,
and having obtained those samadhis, 
the perfect buddhas attain buddhahood there;
the emanations attain buddhahood here. 


And:

There is no buddhahood
in the desire realm or the formless realm;
you who are free from desire will attain buddhahood
in Akaniṣṭha of the form realm.

The Ghanavyuha Sūtra states:

The buddhas abiding in that place
praise Ghanavyūha.
Ghanavyūha has existed from beginningless time.
A self-originated emanation is there,
the stainless Buddha. 
Dwelling beyond the three elements,
That place is without grasping to bliss,
it is free from the experience of I and mine,
it is unchanging, ultimately permanent, and stable. 
Ghanavyūha is unconditioned. 
The perfect buddhas awaken [there]
but without buddhahood in the supreme place, Akaniṣṭha,
the deeds of the buddha will not be performed in the desire realm. 
Once they depart Ghanavyūha 
ten million emanations of the Buddha
will always remain in yogic equipoise.

And:

The Ghanavyūha buddhafield exists beyond the subtle particle nature of the other buddhafields. The Ghanavyūha buddhafield is without the sun, planets, and the moon. Because it’s nature is unconditioned, it does not appear as the most subtle of subtle particles. 

That this was normative for Indian Mahāyāna is shown by this passage from Abhayākaragupta’s Marmakaumudī commentary on the Aṣṭasāhasrikāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra.

After our teacher attained full buddhahood in Akaniṣṭha, the nirmanakāyas are born gradually and all at once in Tuṣita in one billion four-continent worlds contained within the Sahā universe, and after dying there [in Tuṣita], exhibit birth in the continent of Jambudvipa (India) and so on until he intended nirvana.

la bzla ba, it means "to transcend."  This is merely a similarity in name, i.e. thod rgal as skipping stages.  In actuality however, the concept of la bzla ba also exists in Dzogchen, but it has a different usage, while meaning "to transcend".

It is because a small number of very recent masters of Dzogchen favored a version of that view at the sūtra level.

But when it comes to Dzogchen, sūtra views are irrelevant since they are a product of intellectual analysis and do not go beyond it.

Anyway, you just tell them that Longchenpa and Jigme Lingpa both proclaimed Prasanga Madhyamaka to be the view of Madhyamaka closest to the intention of Dzogchen.

Title: Re: Yes, you need a teacher.
Content:
Yes, for people of Hinayāna persuasion. However, the Buddha taught it was necessary to rely on a teacher. In the Samcayagathas is it said:

Just as a group of patients relies on medicine to be cured, 
one should rely unwaveringly upon a virtuous mentor. 

In the Ratnamegha Sūtra, it is said:

Now then, since virtuous qualities will increase and nonvirtue will decline if one relies upon the guru, the preceptor [mkhan po, upādhyāyaḥ] will generate the thought of teaching those with greater or lesser hearing, or those with discipline or corrupted discipline.

In the Gandhāvyuha Sūtra it is said:

The virtuous mentor comprehends incorrect actions, correctly turns one away from shameless places, [12/a] extracts one from the city of samsara…Child of a good family, since one always thinks in that way, serve virtuous mentors.

And:


Child of a good family, since one is ill from karma and afflictions, generate the thought that one is a patient. Generate the thought that the virtuous mentor is a physician. Generate the thought that the Dharma instructions are the medicine. Generate the thought that one’s diligent practice of such Dharma will cure the illness […]

As did Maitreyanatha:

Rely on a virtuous mentor  who is disciplined, peaceful, pacified, 
diligent in the highest qualities, very learned,
understands the truth, eloquent, 
has a loving nature, and has abandoned regret. 

And:

One should serve the virtuous mentor  
through veneration, wealth, attendance, and practice. 

As did Nāgārjuna:

If you rely on those who
are content, compassionate, and disciplined, 
with discerning wisdom that removes afflictions,
through knowing them, give them respect.


And Śantideva:

The virtuous mentor 
skilled in the meaning of Mahāyāna and 
possessing the supreme disciplined conduct of a bodhisattva
should never be abandoned, even at the cost of one’s life.

Even the Three Hundred Verses on Vinaya states

Disciplined, knows the rites of Vinaya, 
loving towards the ill, has a pure retinue, 
diligent in giving assistance with Dharma and materials,
his instruction timely— such a guru is to be praised.

It is not that they should not be studied, but if one is mainly interested in practice, becoming familiar with the intricacies of the debates between different Tibetan scholars is rather a large waste of time. They got involved in all kinds of debates which really are not germane to the main issues the Indian masters were explicating.

All kinds of buddhas. Of course, one needs to understand that as a nirmanakāya, the Buddha's career here was merely play.

But in a real sense, in the last mahākalpa, when the Buddha was a young man named Generous Hand, he had a teacher named Virtuous Wisdom.  Generous Hand attained buddhahood, and in this eon, it is out of his buddhahood that the three kāyas and the 1002 Buddhas of the Fortunate Eon emanate, including Buddha Śākyamuni, who is the fourth.

The modern life of Milarepa is based on a fictionalized account written in the 16th century which has no support at all in the biography of Milarepa written by Gampopa (in fact the former contradicts the latter point by point on many critical details). It is however quite a dramatic tale, even if it is completely false with respect to the actual details of Milarepa's life, no doubt a gem of Tibetan fantasy literature. You can consider it about as veridical as the story of George Washington cutting down a cherry tree.

While it is certainly the case that the Buddha did not leave his family in a state of abject poverty, he violated certain norms of Indian life by becoming a mendicant renunciate long before completing his social duty as a family man. 

Thus, the scenario which you pain above actually happened. In response, the Buddha began to insist that to become ordained as a member of the Buddhist Sangha, one needed the permission of one's parents, that one be free from debt, etc. Men were deserting their wives and families in droves in order to join the Sangha, especially his fellow tribesman, the Śākyas.

Of course, the story of Marpa treating Milarepa abusively is pure fiction, elaborated centuries after the fact by Tsangnyon Heruka. It never happened. You might want to take a look at Peter Alan Roberts life of Rechungpa. Likewise, the twelve trials of Naropa are pure fiction. 

With respect to Patrul Rinpoche, being spit at is an interesting way to receive introduction, but not especially outrageous.

The point of course is that these traditional stories of the Kagyus, even though they never happened, are being used over and over again to motivate students to accept any behavior of any guru as justified. And that is just plain sick bullshit. But you are free -- if you think being abused and shat upon is going to cause you to understand the nature of the mind more rapidly, go for it. Good luck with that. And if you understand already the nature of the mind without such extreme measures, what is the point of glorifying them? As far as I can tell, this is just a kind of Vajrayāna sado-masochistic machismo.

In general, I find there is a lot of weird fantasy tripping in which Vajrayāna practitioners in the West engage. They range from the masochistic, "Tilopa tortured Naropa so if my guru beat me he loves me" to the inflated  "I am a sexy, powerful daka/dakini, see how sexy and powerful I am?"

It is all the more odd, because the pinnacle of Vajrayāna, the Great Perfection, has virtually no use for this kind if inflationary thinking. None of the siddhas in the Great Perfection lineage were subjected to the kinds of training we find recounted in the stories of Naropa, Mila, and so on. This Vajrayāna masochism really seems to be a huge Kagyu trip, more than anything.

What happens here is sharing; no teaching happens here at all. 

In order to teach Dharma to people, you have to understand what they need. That means you have to get to know them. Getting to know them takes time. It means you have to be able to enter into the dimension of the person and understand what is beneficial to them. That is not likely to happen on an internet forum. 

The same goes for popular Dharma books. People read them, and feel the author is speaking to them personally. Pema Chodron's mind training books are among the most popular books ever sold. But books are not teachers. Books cannot understand you. Books cannot respond to your questions. It is not that books are a poor substitute for a Dharma teacher, they are no substitute at all. 

In fact, people tend to read "Dharma" books which reinforce their predilections and biases, preferring popular "Dharma" titles which appeal to people's vanity, egotism, and insecurity. Meanwhile, venerable classics languish on shelves, never opened. I mean, just look at the whole slew of books out there which paint Vajrayāna as the triple black diamond ski slope of religious paths, obviously marketed for those who are into spiritual extreme sports. 

Dharma only lives in the interaction between the teacher and the student, based on what the student actually needs for their practice, not what they imagine they need for their practice. Once the student has reflected on and cultivated the meaning in realization, they too can act as teachers for others, but not before.

The modern university setting is just fine if one wishes to become expert in the opinions of westerners about the history of Buddhism; but it won't inform one's practice of Dharma even slightly. 

And of course, peer-review excludes review of one's work by so-called "native" experts.

You can't be taught "going for refuge" from a text. "Going for refuge" means that you understand you are unable to extricate yourself from the floodwaters of samsara under your own power. When you understand this, you get off your ass and go for refuge, that means going and hearing the Dharma from a human being. 

And yes, even the basics need to be heard. This is why I spent a year hearing Abhidharma, another year hearing Madhyamaka, yet another year hearing Lamrim, a year hearing tenet systems, etc., and 25 years hearing Dzogchen and other Vajrayāna teachings, over and over again, often the same topics. 

Sitting respectfully and listening to another human being explain the Dharma simply cannot be matched by reading books alone in one's room, arm akimbo, feet up, snacks in hand, listening to one's favorite music.

My personal experience is that having spent five years studying on my own, reading voraciously, even attending college courses on Buddhism with Malcolm David Eckel, etc., I didn't hear the Dharma until I went to hear Sakya Trizin teach the Dharma in 1989. After that experience, I understood the necessity of hearing the Dharma. So I then heard Madhyamaka, Lamrim, Abhidharma, Lamdre, Mahāmudra, Dzogchen, and so on. I have received the lung for all of the texts I have published or will publish. 

It is apparent in how people post and talk about the Dharma on this forum whether they have heard the Dharma, or are merely reading Dharma texts without having heard them in a proper way.
