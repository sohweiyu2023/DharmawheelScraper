Title: Re: Subtle body

The word "apple" is only a vocalization, which depends upon the rūpa of two people agreeing, whether in print or in conversation, that the word "apple" refers to fruit of Malus domestica, and not a potato, the tuber known as Solanum tuberosum—though both in French are called "pomme." Hence, pomme frites refers to what we called French Fries, but literally, means "fried apple." 

You are confusing concept and language, because subjectively, we have a hard time distinguishing the two. But the point that you are missing, consistently here, is that it is because of the physical structure of the nāḍīs in the body that we have a body at all, and those nāḍīs contain shapes, called akṣara, syllables, which are responsible for giving rise to speech as well as our experience of the six realms. 

What you are referring to as language is termed, in the sutras and so on, as "verbal conceptuality," this means that among the trio of body, voice, and mind, speech belongs to voice, it remains physical. Verbal conceptuality on the other hand, derives from learning which sounds correspond to which objects. 

To return to the Buddhist perspective, the Buddha states in the Lankāvatara Sūtra that words and concepts can be neither the same nor different. The Buddha points out that if mental conceptuality and words are the same, then concepts cannot be the cause of words, because concepts are the cause of words and words are the result of concepts (though conventional agreement, of course), and it is a standard principle that causes and their effects cannot be identical. If concepts and words are different, than the same fault applies, because there is no way a word will arise from a concept in this case. But here the Buddha never varies from his presentation that composition of words are physical, based on syllables, which emerge from eight locations: chest, throat, head, the tongue, teeth, nose, lips, and palate, and so on. And this ties right in with the distinction between karma, volition, and verbal and bodily actions, which are both physical. 

The entire discussion on verbal conceptuality in this sūtra is extremely interesting, because it is also taken up the Caryāmelapakaprādipa by Āryadeva II, but these texts never present a substantially different view from Abhidharma, which regards speech and language as fundamentally physical phenomena. And of course the whole point of the discussion is to show how the personally known gnosis (pratyatmyavedanajñāna) is completely beyond expression and not within the range of words and concepts. The discussion begins with how the notion of nonbuddhist permanence is a mere verbal conception, pointing out that like the horns of a rabbit, their permanent and inconceivable entity can have no cause and no characteristic, being a mere imputation. However, when contrasted with the personal knowledge of āryas, since it has a cause, and is free from the extremes of existence and nonexistence, our permanence and inconceivability is validly established, and therefore, it is not a mere verbal conception; its is a product of noble realization. 

Which gets us to the real point of why the nāḍīs are physical structures in the body. The Buddha states in the Lanka, "For as long as there is engagement with verbal conceptuality, there will be permanence and annihilation. By exhausting thoughts of verbal conceptuality, the childish views of permanence and annihilation are averted, and due to the mind being free of them, it is no more."

The purpose of elucidating the formation of the body is to elucidate the formation of the nadis, etc. Vajrayāna theory in general holds that by eliminating the eighty course conceptual thoughts—specifically in the practice related to purifying the nāḍī syllables, which are the root of all verbal conceptuality in the Vajrayāna scheme of things—this makes it more possible for us to identify personally known gnosis and have that knowledge. This is why is is important to understand why verbal conceptuality and language are not the same thing. In addition the fact, to, as I pointed out before, that language barriers are as physical as walls.

If you wish to understand the classical position on this point, according to the Sautrantika school, refer to the discussion on Nāmakāya in chapter 2 of the Abhidharmakosha, verse 47ab. They say, "A nāman (word) is a sound upon which persons have come to agreement that it is signifies certain things."

Your argument is realist, i.e. that there is something underlying speech called "language." But the Buddhist position is nominalist—language comes from agreement that certain sounds are agreed to represent certain things. For example, if language was in the mind, then all creatures with minds should have language, and the same language as well. But this is not the case, since formless realm beings have no language and engage in no communication at all, even though they have concepts, such as "limitless emptiness" and so on. Your name is imputed onto your body  a posteriori, not a priori. There is an appearance—the nonconceptual engagement of a sense object—and then that appearance is conventionally designated; not the other way round.

Meaning is not transmitted directly, mind to mind, but through the physical media of sound, physically created images, and gestures. In other words, pada, words, are the medium for artha, meaning.

Vak—voice, speech, and language, are purely physical. The word “language,” has, as its etymon, lingua: tongue/speech/language. 
 
Likewise Vak is a direct cognate of vox, which is the nominative of vocem, “voice, sound, utterance, cry, call, speech, sentence, language, word.”

Speech likewise comes from proto Germanic *sprek, etc, utterance, etc.

For example, if I only know Tibetan, and you only know English, it is impossible for the meaning of Dharma to be conveyed, because of a physical language barrier. And language barriers are as physical as a wall.

To out it another way, meaning (dharmakaya) is conveyed physically (rupakaya), by means  of symbols (sambhogkaya) and words (nirmanakaya).

Vocal actions, speech, is part of the rūpaskandha. You are confusing mind with body. 

The sambhogakāya belongs to the rūpakāya, the material kāya. 

Karma is cetana (namaḥ), and what proceeds from cetana: verbal and physical actions (rūpa). Generally, nāmaḥ, mind, corresponds to the dharmakāya; where as the rūpa, matter, corresponds to the two rūpakāyas, speech and body.  

Nāḍīs, bindus, and vāyus are all exclusively physical structures in the human body, as anyone who has studied the process of gestation described in Kālacakra, the Cakrasamvara Tantras, and the 17 Dzogchen tantras will rapidly understand. 

In Buddhism, there are no entities that exists outside the six dhātus: earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness. Whatever is the limit of samsara, that is the limit of nirvana, and vice versa.

Buddha nature is in fact an “object“ of a Buddha’s omniscience. It’s the dharmakaya “encased” in afflictions. This is why only Buddhas can perceive it, according to sutrayana. It cannot  be perceived even by tenth stage bodhisattvas, since they retain a diaphanous knowledge obscuration. Therefore, it is said to be an object of faith for people like us, but not something we can ascertain directly. We can only infer it through reasoning. Nevertheless, if that reasoning leads one to assert there is something permanent etc., this is automatically a wrong view since it is based on a concept, rather than gnosis.

Being aborted, like being murdered, can be a result of karma one committed in a past life. For example, your karmavipaka sucks so bad you were conceived in the womb of a women who does not want to be pregnant with you. There are no "innocents" in the web of samsara. The idea that fetuses are "innocent" is an entirely Christian idea, based on creationist ideology.

Also, since all sentient beings are predicted to full buddhahood, being aborted now and again is hardly going impeded the force of the Buddha's prediction in this respect. After all, since there is no beginning to samsara, we've all been aborted countless times, and our mind streams still keep coming back for more. Of course, if one is a Christian, its a one shot deal, so more serious for then, because somehow their pitiless god does not automatically conduct aborted souls to heaven.

In the United States, abortion is a legal medical procedure, and women who seek it should not be be penalized by being refused financial relief if they are unable to afford the procedure. 

Ideally, people should try to avoid having abortions. Realistically, unwanted pregnancies will happen. It is far better for abortions to be safe and legal, than for them to be illegal, forcing women to resort to unsafe measures to end pregnancies. I personally do not favor abortion; however, I am totally against legislating religious principles into law.

The term "bodhicitta" is used differently in Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna, and within Vajrayāna, it is used differently in mahāyoga and anuyoga (so called highest yoga tantra) and Atiyoga, where the term is sort of equivalent to the state of mahāmudra—with the caveat being that mahāmudra describes the result, whereas bodhicitta describes the basis, when arranged on the trio of basis, path, and result.

A slightly better translation of bodhicitta, byang chub sems, would be, "The mind essence comprehended as pure." 

The group that claims that we should maintain a conceptual view that everything is pure are fools, very far away from the meaning of Dzogchen. They do not understand that this term, bodhicitta, is a description the realization of the pure nature of the mind, the basis, as being pure. Of course, if one is completely integrated with the knowledge of bodhicitta, then for you there is no karma and you will act spontaneously to benefit beings. But as long as one is distracted, one subject to affliction and action and its results, as is explained in the definition provided by the author of that text, Kunzang Dorje.

To understand this we have to understand two things: 1) the cause of longevity: merit, and lifeforce (this is why most longevity mantras contain "ayuḥpunya"; and 2) the object of purification: the obscurations of affliction and knowledge, to which sometimes also karma is added as an obscuration. So now you can understand the real reason teachers recommend purification practices to their students when they become ill. It certainly isn't for their own benefit in order to live longer.

All compounded things are impermanent, including the physical bodies of famous teachers, including the body of Śākyamuni Buddha. Some people have the idea that if people break their samaya, it will shorten the life of a teacher, or cause health problems for the teacher. But in ChNN's case, he lived a full 80 years, the same age as the Buddha. If breaking samaya was really a cause for a teacher's early demise, I think the life span of teachers would be shorter than the battlefield life of a tank, about one week.

Khyentse Chokyi Wangchuk was a casualty of Derge Tulku politics, and still is, as one can see from Orgyen Thobgyal's less than kind remarks about him and the manner in which the retainers of Jamyang Khyentse Chokyi Lodo actively obstructed Norbu Rinpoche's access to the latter in Sikkim. Norbu Rinpoche wanted people to understand these circumstances because they explain a lot about the way Norbu Rinpoche's own career and teaching progressed, as well as the legacy that Yeshi was to inherit. 

There are many instructive lessons here concerning the vicissitudes of the the tulku system, especially when incarnations are recognized outside of the Tibetan cultural sphere. It is well know that my personal opinion is that the practice of recognizing incarnations does not port particularly well in non-Tibetan cultural spheres.

Content:
BTW, "Sources substantiating claims about "Hindus" not achieving liberation" is a misstated question. 

Think about it. What do Buddhists claim liberation is? It is very simple, and all Buddhist schools, including Dzogchen, agree that liberation is freedom from affliction that causes rebirth in samsara. There are schools in Hinduism that agree with this proposition also.

But where do they disagree with Buddhadharma? 

Hindu schools do not agree with how Buddha defined rebirth, or with how Buddha presented karma, or Buddha's presentation of dependent origination, and they reject the Buddha's assertion of two-fold emptiness. Thus, how could they possibly be discussing the same liberation as the Buddha? It is quite impossible actually. 

So it is very simple to examine what various Hindu Darshan's claim about liberation and the procedures for realizing it. When you find a Hindu school that is not Buddhism that presents essentially the same message as Buddhism on rebirth. karma, dependent origination, two-fold emptiness, and so on, please share your research with us. As far as I know, that only nonbuddhist school which agrees with Buddhadharma on all of these points is Bon. 

Until then, this conversation is fruitless.

The Buddha statements to this effect maybe found in the Mahaparinibbana sutta, as well as the Majjhima Nikaya. In these texts it is recorded that he said that outside of his Dharma and Vinaya, there were no stream entrants, once-returners, never-returners, or arhats. This means that there are no awakened people outside of those who follow Buddhadharma. Some people may object, "what about pratyekabuddhas?" A pratyekabuddha is a kind of an arhat who previously generated to the bodhicitta aspiration to achieve awakening in a future rebirth, even though a samyaksambuddha had not taken birth in the world.

Indeed, Sapan, without question, was the greatest scholar in Tibet in the 13th century. And why not? He spoke and wrote Sanskrit fluently, had received nearly every teaching extant in Tibet during his day, had studied with 30 Indian tutors, and so on. His personal library boasted 3000 texts in Tibetan and Sanskrit,  etc., etc. Actually, Tibet has never seen such a scholar since his time. That does not mean I personally agree with every one of his claims or critiques. But his scholarship was an exemplary model of an originalist approach to Buddhadharma, basing himself closely on what the texts of sūtra and tantra say, as opposed to the opinions of this or that guru.

Consciousness, like space, is a dhātu (khams), but not a bhūta ('byung ba). Hence, it is counted among the six "elements," but is not one of four material "elements."

In the Buddhist scheme of things in general, consciousness gives rise to matter. All matter derives from consciousness. Though it seems there is Catersian Dualism in Buddhism, this is actually not correct. There is no absolute mind/matter dualism in Buddhadharma. Mind (nama) conditions matter (rūpa), matter conditions mind.

Well, you can count my hair too, since that is a KDL thing. Otherwise, I just wear whatever I like, wherever I like. No one has yet ever said to me, "you can't be a ngakpa if you don't wear a white lower robe, a blue shirt, and a striped Zen." I have met so many different lamas from the Dudjom Tersar tradition, and they all wear different cloths, some rock the ngakpa gear, some don't, some do occasionally, some never do, one guy I know wheres in Indian dhoti for his white lower robe. There is nothing certain at all. It's all just a play of delusion.

It is good to reorient yourself from thinking of rupa as “form” unless rupa is referring to the object of the eye. 

Rupaskandha is the material aggregate, not the form aggregate. So, the organ of sight is included in the material aggregate because it is matter, etc.

It will be covered, but in brief, very intelligent people can infer the other two from the skandhas. Very good mediators can meditate the dhatus more in depth, since the dharmadhatu contains all the compounded and uncompounded dharmas, other than the matter, sensation and perception aggregate, and it breaks out the six sense consciousnesses from the mano ayatana.

Recall, the whole purpose this to undermine the notion of self of the person. So, put another way, if one’s material aggregate includes all sense objects, it isn’t really “one’s” material aggregate.

No, they are forms, which means they are essentially colored matter. as you may recall, Sarvastivadins try to distinguish visual shape and color; Sautrantikas reject this and assert visual shape is defined by color.

The way the Sarvāstivādin's conceive it, taking vows causes a material change of state of the material aggregate. One cannot perceive it, hence it is called avijñāpti-rūpa, imperceptible matter.  When the vow is broken or relinquished, this causes another change of the state of one's material aggregate. 

Sautrantikas reject this idea in toto. They say, simply, vows are intents, until they are disrupted by another intent. This is actually the basis for the Tibetan Buddhist position that the five upāsaka vows cannot all be broken if one is broken, and one can keep one, two, three or all, depending on ones situation.

Depends on the bodhisattva. For example, due to the negative karma of killing the thief, it is said that the sea captain briefly endured rebirth in hell. This is well known. 

Of course Buddhas have no negative karma, their descent from Tuṣita up to parinirvana is just a play, a show, a display, as the Mahāyāna sūtras point out.

"Superior" is also a relative judgement. It really depends on what criteria you are setting forth for "superior". Even a tenth stage bodhisattva does not have the omniscience of a samyaksambuddha. So the real question, if omniscience is one's criteria [it's mine], how will that omniscience can be achieved most expeditiously. If that is one's criteria, then most certainly the royal bodhicitta motivation is "superior."

As for the Buddha manifesting birth in Lumbini, this was not a real birth of a real person. Buddhas do not attain buddhahood in the desire realm. This is clearly stated in the Lankāvatāra and other sūtras. They attain buddhahood in Akaniṣṭha Ghanavyuha. 

Śākyamuni Buddha's twelve deeds were like a puppet show, where mud and sticks are assembled to create an illusion of kings and queens, horses and elephants, and so on. A necessary illusion, but an illusion nevertheless.

Ngakpas are often very poorly behaved. There is quite good reason for the poor view the Monastic Sangha have of ngakpas. Drinking to excess, womanizing, and excusing it all as "dharma practice." Not every ngakpa was as noble as HH Dudjom Rinpoche, Jikdral Yeshe Dorje or HH Sakya Trichen, in fact, probably very few. I am definitely not. So, I don't pretend.

This is not at all certain. A nirmabakaya displays the form of birth appropriate to where they are manifesting, but since the “Buddha” qua “Buddha” is the dharmakaya, no Buddha at any time ever took birth anywhere, and yet, sentient beings everywhere have never been abandoned.

Should/shouldn’t are quite relative. If one teacher prefers you to wear religious gear, and another teacher discourages it, should you wear it in the presence of the teacher who discourages it? I learned early we need to be flexible when I understood, for example, that Chogyal Namkhai Norbu strongly discouraged his students from offering prostrations to him, or wearing zens and so on. 

Though I have all the requisites to be part of the white-robed, long-haired bunch, I prefer casual clothes and don’t wear any religious gear at all. Other people feel they need to wear it, and that’s fine with me. But I generally discourage it among my pupils.  If I am cold, I prefer a non-religious shawl or blanket around the shoulders. So these things are quite relative. I‘ve personally never met a teacher who insisted I wear some kind of gear. I doubt I would be that interested up in such a teacher. When I go to teachings I wear decent clothes, and do not dress like a hippy. The only difference between me and others is the length of my hair, which I have never cut in 16 years, though attrition through age means is it not as long as it was a decade ago.

They are things experienced by the tactile organ, the body, and which must be touched or experienced physically. For example, though one can see the earth element, etc., as form, in order sense it’s weight, or other quality you must pick it up or feel it with your body organ. You cannot see the air element, but you can feel breezes, and so on. The sensations of the other three primary elements are self explanatory, fire feels hot, water feels wet.

As I said before, don’t get lost in the weeds of the debates. It will not contribute to your understanding of the basic subject. Save that for when you have understood the root text and the basic commentary. Things that are absent here are taken up later. It is helpful to understand that the topics in the Kosha are recursive. For example, the most detailed discussion of avijnapti occurs in the beginning of chapter four, Karma. As I mentioned already, the formation skandha receives its major explication in chapter two, indriyas.

I assume you referring to my comment. It is a misconception that bodhisattva vows include taking rebirth continually. For example, royal bodhicitta is the motivation to attain buddhahood as fast as possible in order to able to help sentient ad infinitum, but Buddhas do not take rebirth. Rebirth is a samsaric process to which only bodhisattvas below the eight bhumi are subject. Eight stage+ bodhisattvas have power over birth as well. There is of course the captain motivation, vowing to attain buddhahood simultaneously will all sentient beings, and the Shepard motivation, vowing to make sure all sentient beings attain buddhahood before oneself. In Vajrayana, we generally consider the first of these three to be the most skillful.

One may or may not spend time practicing deity yoga.

In this case, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu is not your guru, not even your teacher. He is just some Tibetan dude you expressed some curiosity in. At best, you received a positive trace for meeting the teachings in a future life.  

You met fifteen Dzogchen teachers. You really were devoted to them all. You didn't understand shit until you met ChNN for a conversation in a bar. But his few words opened up the meaning of Dzogchen for you. In this case, ChNN is your root guru. The others, gurus of empowerment and lineage only.

Just think of all the people who waltz into an online empowerment, or tune into a Lama Lena Facebook teaching which is literally open to a billion people, check it out for a while, and then move onto say, Jax. So really, Lena is their guru? Their teacher? Or lets say someone checks out Buddhism for while, does Ngondro, and then, for whatever reason, they decide to become Christians, and hang up their mala for good. Did they ever have a guru in a real sense? 

This idea that participating in a ritual or a teaching makes someone your guru is a somewhat strange idea if you have no idea of the meaning of the teachings and so, on, and no faith in the teachings, and no interest in following them as your path. 

Of course, this idea is a traditional idea, one which functions well in homogenous Buddhist society where everyone is more or less on the same page. But in our culture it really does not apply, in my opinion.

Yes. And, to bring up Danny's point, since they never learned how to make anything useful, they can't even get a good "working class" job, with which to pay off their loans. 

In reality, education should consist of both reading, etc.,  as well as learning the basics of useful things like farming, carpentry, plumbing etc. As for myself, I am told I am an excellent cook. I worked in food industry for many years when I was in my late teens and 20's. If I need to get a job flipping burgers, no problem. I am something of an expert on that subject alone. Never been afraid to work, and though I come from an upper middle class family, I never graduated from a western school, not one, unless you count 6th grade. So I worked a lot of "shit" jobs. Dishwashing, construction, prep cooking, etc., etc.

A convention is something, which, left unanalyzed, seems to stand on its own. For example, "I am going to town." But when analyzed, the convention "going" is held to be untenable, since apart from something which has gone and something which has not gone, there is no present going. I refer you to Nāgārjuna's analysis of movement, from which this example is drawn.

Examples of thing which are not even conventionally possible are hair on a tortoise, horns on a rabbit, and the children of barren women.

"Convention" means "appears to function."

So that means there are phenomena existing independently of us.

Now, the basic proposition:

“As we realize with the utmost effort that all times (jinji) are all existence (jin’u), absolutely no additional dharma remains."

"All times" must refer to the past, present, and future.  All existence is included in these three times. As I pointed outed once one before I fail to see, facially, how this assertion is any better than the Hinayāna Sarvastivāda school's assertion that all phenomena exist in the three times. 

Since Nāgārjuna effectively refutes time as a being anything more than a convention, and effectively refutes cause and condition as being anything more than a convention, I fail to see how your phenomena existing independently of one's projections is also anything more than a convention, which cannot be established in any way at all. Further, with respect to Dogen's assertion, if being = time, and time = being, the failure to establish one is the also the failure to establish the other since they are held to be mutually dependent. 

In other words, rather than there being an eternal now, as someone suggested in this thread, in fact, no dharma ever arose anywhere at any time. The meaning of dependent origination is just nonorigination. I am certain Dogen addresses this point somewhere in his writing, and realizes this point, because everyone one understands Dogen to be a sublimely realized master.

Correct. Among the uncommon or "unshared" preliminaries, the source of mandala offerings and guru yoga is the Guhyasamāja Tantra. These practices do not exist in lower tantras, much less sūtra.

Well, there is the fact that no sutra mentions this word, “mahamudra.” The position Astus produced  is based on cherry picked citations that do not take into consideration the whole text being cited. 

I even pointed out that Sakyapas do exactly the same thing Kagyus do, that is, teach shamatha and vipashyana bolstered with mahamudra citations from Saraha, Virupa, and so on, the primary difference being that Sakyapas are a) unwilling to term this sutra mahamudra and b) unwilling to admit there are other forms of entry into Vajrayana than a major empowerment. As for b) I don’t hold the Sakya position. I never have, even though I have argued from that position as a formality. You should not assume I believe every position I defend. I’ve even defended Tsongkhapa’s presentation of the two truths for fun. It is called sharpening prajna.

There is certainly no Indian precedent for the idea that there can be mahāmudra in absence of some kind of empowerment. None whatsoever. This is just a fact. There is nothing to argue about here.

But again, "authority" is up to you, not some book that says this or that. If people want to believe the realization of mahāmudra does not depend on a guru and empowerment, they are perfectly free to hold that belief. But it certainly isn't born out by an examination of his collected works that Gampopa actually believed this himself. In fact, in Gampopa's works one even finds criticisms of mahāmudra and dzogchen in favor of tattva, reality/truth. I am afraid that until his whole collected works are translated, it will be difficult for people to really understand completely what his point of view was.

No, this is an error. As I pointed out, Ganden Mahāmudra is quite late, formulated in the mid 17th century by the First Panchen Lama. I already pointed out that it was subject to derision by no less a personage than the Great Fifth Dalai Lama, his younger contemporary. 

The first articulated defenses from the Kagyus of various stripes against Sapan's critiques waited for an entire two centuries. 

Some would argue that Sapan was the most important master of mahāmudra in Tibet. He was after all an eighth stage bodhisattva. Just saying. It all depends on one's perspective and what one chooses to accept and reject. After all, oneself is the ultimate authority in all matters of religion, and no one else.

You didn't distinguish what kinds of Buddhist you meant. Of course, there are more Asian Buddhist in the Americas. But this is generally "pastoral Buddhism," where wats and and so on are built by immigrant communities to provide pastoral services and traditional rites for lay people by a monastic community. Then of course there is SGI, which is very diverse, and probably has the largest number of black people, Pure Land Buddhism, (though Pure Land generally falls into the pastoral Buddhist category). But in terms of people who are interested in actually practicing Buddhism, apart from SGI and other Nicherin groups, and not merely receiving pastoral services, this is a predominately a white, upper-middle class aging hippy phenomena.

More importantly, the term “mahamudra” occurs in no sutra at all.

The so-called word empowerment is based on a specific experience. So are Mahamudra pointing-out instructions. I have received one on one Mahamudra pointing out instructions in the Karma Kagyu tradition from Ayang Rinpoche, a direct disciple of the 16th Karmapa. So I understand how this works very well through my own experience. You will not understand this unless you to do the necessary work, find a guru, do what is necessary to please them, and make oneself a suitable candidate for such instructions. It is really that simple. 

All the authors of all the Mahamudra books you are fond of quoting all assume that one has the required experience necessary for Mahamudra pointing out. 

Further conversation about this is rather pointless. You are like a man who, having never tasted sugar, insists on arguing with those who have what “sweet” tastes like based on descriptions of “sweet” in a number of books.

Well, since you are a bodhisattva, you have an obligation to become expert in all dharma paths as much as possible. So, you better place yourself at the feet of a qualified Vajrayāna master quickly, because all the best ones are dying out pretty quickly. 

I personally regret that first encounter with Zen was Eido Roshi, and that I was only 16 at the time when I did a weekend sesshin with him at Dai Bosatsu Zendo in the Catskills. Sometimes, when I am in a particularly generous mood, I am inclined to place Zen among the paths of self-liberation as well. But even when I not so inclined, Zen is the definitive expression of Mahāyāna sūtra paths, AFAIC. But I don't think I could ever practice with Meido. As much as I respect him, not into boot camps or martial arts.  I am too much of an old hippy.

This is because sutra is spangs lam, the path of renunciation, but in secret mantra systems, there are two paths, sgyur lam, the path of transformation and grol lam, the path of self-liberation. Both Kagyu Mahāmudra and Dzogchen belong to the last path.

We've established there is no such thing, other than as a name for prajñāpāramitā, to inspire unfortunate yogis. If you examine Kongtrul's encycolpedia where he reviews the three kinds of Mahāmudra, it is quite clear in his writings that so-called sūtra mahāmudra is for inferior practitioners who are not ready for actual mahāmudra teachings. These days however, these three kinds of mahāmudra are not actually taught separately, as Cone pointed out, and furthermore, this is principally a Karma Kagyu scheme, as far I know.

Also in Sakya, in the Three Visions teachings of Lamdre, they do not use the term "mahāmudra" per se, but they do combine dohas with teachings on śamatha and vipaśyanā. For Nyingmapas, mahāmudra is either an alternate name for the state of Dzogchen, like Prajñapāramitā, or more commonly, refers to realizing the nature of the mind in the form of a yidam, and refers to the third of the four vidyādhara stages.

Without empowerment, a guru is just a common Mahāyāna guru, there is no guru yoga in common Mahāyāna.. Guru Yoga is method which strictly belongs to Highest Yoga Tantra. So no, it is not an acceptable distinction. Guru Yoga is also connected with the so-called subtle body, and is not merely a practice of devotion, as is commonly misunderstood.

You mean Avadhūtīpa Advayavajra aka Maitrigupta aka Maitrīpa, the disciple of Naropa, the guru of Marpa, who was an adept of Cakrasamvara? Who states in the Tattvaratnāvalī:

Here I shall not explain the texts of secret mantras because they are extremely profound, because they are the domain of those persons very devoted to the profound vehicle, and because practice of the four seals and so on has been very extensively explained. Further:

"Though the goal is the same, unconfused;
with many methods, not difficult,
and to be undertaken by those of sharp faculties,
the treatises of mantra are superior."


We are talking about the same person, correct? If so, what more is there to say about this master's view of sūtra and his position vis a vie Vajrayāna? Perhaps he did equate Madyamaka with Mahāmudra (textual citation please), but how is this different than equating the gnosis of Prajñāpārāmitā with Mahāmudra? No one is claiming the gnosis is different. But in this text, Maitripa is clearly claiming that Mantrayāna is superior in method. I mean, what else is there to say? 

Having knocked down your bowling pins one by one, friend, it is high time for you to accept your defeat. You are not equipped for this argument in anyway.

In the 11th and 12th century, it was fashionable at the time to dismiss Dzogchen, because a) Lha Lama Yeshe Od wrote a polemical tract against it; Go Khugpa Lhatse wrote a polemical tract accusing its principle imperial and post-imperial period proponents (Ma Rinchen Chog, Nubchen Sangye Yeshe) of forging its basic texts, and so on. 

In addition to this, Dzogchen was that old stuff from the imperial period, so it fell out of favor. Both the Kagyus and the Sakyapas had narratives developed around abandoning that Old Time Religion; the former grounded in the narrative of Milarepa being too much of a dunce to understand the teachings of Dzogchen he received from one Rongton; the latter grounded in the narrative of Khon Konchog Gyalpo and his older brother seeing secret Nyingma cham performed in public at a harvest festival. In addition to this was the hostility towards the older translation school tantras mentioned above, which is enthusiastically adopted and promulgated by orthopraxy-obsessed Dromton (who interfered with Atish's wish to focus on teaching Dohas, and termed a māra by Milarepa in one of his songs), etc. 

So, from the time of Gampopa, all the way up through 18th century, it was de rigueur for everyone to criticize Dzogchen, notable Kagyupas such as the 8th Karmapa included. 

Thankfully, Nyingma tertons and yogis paid such FUD little mind and just kept on promulgating Dzogchen teachings.

If you examine Kongtrul's encyclopedia, he clearly states, echoing Jñānakīrti, that "sutra mahāmudra" was taught to inferior disciples who were not suitable for receiving actual Mahāmudra teachings. Why? Because they do not receive empowerment of any kind and are not proper recipients. So they receive instructions on śamatha and vipaśyanā, and inspiring dohas to reflect on. 

Of course, this is not how the mahāmudra is actually taught in any Kagyu school, so you are just dancing on books you don't understand completely in a tradition that is not your own. A little knowledge as proven to be a dangerous thing in your case, Ācārya Astus. You should stay in your Chan lane. 

As for your other point, it is true that Sakya Pandita and others do not accept a so-called "direct introduction" as a sufficient entry into Vajrayāna, but I am not defending Sapan on this point, since I myself do not agree with this perspective. 

Nevertheless, those who do accept this principle still understand that "direct introduction," "pointing out," etc., "the empowerment of the potential of vidyā (rig pa'i rtsal dbang)," etc. are empowerments in every sense of the term and defend them on those terms, and consider these empowerments indispensable for entering the path. However, they maintain that these empowerments are reserved for those pupils of highest capacity, hence they are not suitable for everyone. Thus, essence mahāmudra, etc., are traditionally only given to people on the basis of having studied and practiced regular Vajrayāna teachings for many years.

*Most of Sapan's other criticisms, for example, of the karpo cigthub, are directed at Lama Shang, not Gampopa proper.

It is so, it is not "even if that were so." 

Also, the First Panchen Lama's "Ganden" Mahāmudra when it was introduced was quite controversial and even derided by the Great Fifth Dalai Lama, and remains somewhat controversial even still; though the present Dalai Lama has a more charitable view of it then did his predecessor. Indeed, a book of his teachings on this subject was published by Snow Lion.  

So, Astus, I can call you a buddha, but that is a mere nominal designation, because I am pretty sure if we look between your legs, we will see that your penis dangles down like all other ordinary men, rather than being withdrawn into a sheath, like a buddha. Likewise, you can call Prajñāpāramitā "mahāmudra" if your goal is to inspire unfortunate yogis, as Jñānakīrti maintains, but it is still just calling something a name for which it lacks proper attributes; for example, calling a dog "Lion," or a small hill a "mountain," or a tiny pond a "lake" or a huge man "little."

The Samādhirāja Sūtra says nothing of the sort. 

The term "mahāmudra" is not exist in that sūtra or any other. This is just a fact. Therefore, you must stop using this citation. The scholar who originally claimed this citation as a support for mahāmudra was merely interpolating his bias into the text in order to deceive his hapless disciples. 
The passage you are citing is this one:

།འདི་ལས་སངས་རྒྱས། ཡེ་ཤེས་མཆོག་ཀྱང་འབྱུང༌། །ཆོས་རྣམས་ཀུན་གྱི་རང་བཞིན་ཕྱག་རྒྱ་སྟེ། །ཏིང་འཛིན་འདི་ནི་འདྲེན་བདག་གིས་བཤད།

“It originates from the supreme wisdom of buddhahood.
It is the seal of the nature of all phenomena.
This is the samādhi taught by the guides."

17.144, Roberts, 84,000 edition. 

Therefore, we can understand the term "mahāmudra" exists exclusively the tantras. Even there is has different meanings. 

Indeed the Tattvāvatārākhyasakalasugatavacastātparyavyākhyāprakaraṇa says "Another name of the Bhagavāti Prajñāpāramita is mahāmudra, because it has the inherent nature of nondual gnosis." 

But this has been poorly understood. Here, the Bhagavāti Prajñāpāramita is part of the maṇḍala of Guhyasamāja, etc., as the text describes in detail.

Further, far from being a treatise which equivocates sutrayāna or provides a basis for claiming that sutrayāna also has mahāmudra, it is quite the opposite. It is a text which explicates secret mantra for those of the best capacity. It says, "Because other yogis lack good fortune (skal med), gnosis is taught as mahāmudra in order to introduce them."

These above teachings are consistent with the path of renunciation. However, they are contradicted by the higher teachings of Vajrayāna, the path of transfomation, and the citations illustrating this point have already been provided above, so there is no need to repeat them here. 

As also mentioned above, the Buddha's teachings of sūtra are for those with a) less affliction, and b) less capability. But contrast, Vajrayāna teachings are designed for those with a) greater affliction, and b) greater capabilities.

Therefore, can either accept the Buddha's teachings in the tantras, in which case, one has no choice but to become a Vajrayāna practitioner; but failing that, if one cannot generate faith in these teachings, then leave them aside, but do not criticize them, because there in lies the fault of criticizing the Dharma.

There are many such contradictions because "the Buddha's higher teachings regularly conflict with the Buddha's lower teachings."

The distinction generally drawn is between renunciation (three lower vehicles) and transformation (kriya tantra to anuyoga). In Vajrayāna, through skillful means:

The authenticity of a teaching is decided on the basis of its content, not its supposed provenance, determined by some historiographical criteria, which is at best arbitrary and a product of the perceptions of common people. 

What you are basically proposing is that the authenticity of a given Dharma text or teaching is to be determined on the basis of the contaminated perceptions of common people rather than the uncontaminated insight of āryas. Thus, practitioners invested in the matter of studying Dharma should follow the latter rather than the former.

No, that is not what I mean. According to Mahāyāna tradition, the Mahāyāna Sūtra were collected by Mañjuśṛī and Samantabhadra. Ānanda's secret identity is Samantabhadra Bodhisattva. 

Mahāyāna teachings arose at the same time as Hinayāna teachings, but because no one could understand them, they were cached away. This is the traditional point of view.

Content:
No, it is not more correct to say consciousness arises or ceases than a labelled self, a since consciousness is also a conventional label, like the label "self." Prior to analysis there is both a self, akuppa, and a consciousness. After analysis one will find neither self nor consciousness, beyond the designations "akuppa" and "consciousness." For example, take a car as a metaphor for "self". A car cannot be found in any part, all of its parts, or separate from its parts. Likewise, as self cannot be found in any aggregates, all of the aggregates, or apart from the aggregates. Likewise, consciousness cannot be found in the sense organ nor the sense object, both, or separate from them. The mind is also made of parts, and cannot be found in one of them, all of them, or separate from them. 

Functionally speaking, we can say there is a self, because when I say "akuppa go there!" You will respond to this directive by saying yes or no. This means that "self" is functional. It is efficient. Whatever is functional corresponds with relative truth. If I said to you, "Malcolm go there!" you would respond, "I am not Malcolm." So calling you "malcolm" is not functional and therefore cannot be considered to be relatively true. Consciousness is a relative truth, as long as it performs its functions, then we can say "there is a consciousness." But when we analyze consciousness, we cannot find it outside of the conventions we use for an appearance we label "mind."

I think you have not properly studied the doctrine of karma. See chapter 4, Abhidharmakośabhaṣya. 

Karma is not simple cause and effect, though is is often misrepresented this way. Karma is moral cause and effect, which determines happy and unhappy states of existence. 

In Abhidharmakośabhaṣya, simple cause and effect are presented first in the section on the six causes and four conditions described in chapter 2. Then comes dependent origination, chapter 3; and after that karma and its results, chapter 4. 

Your example is an instance of simple cause and effect, but this is not karmic cause and effect. For example, one of the reasons I never found Huayen and Tiantai particularly profound with all their talk of interpenetration, mutuality and so on, is that this is already covered in the Sarvāstivādin kāraṇa-hetu. This means that all things are automatically the cause of all other things apart from themselves.

Later, when the discussion of "partless atoms" comes up, you will see that atoms are irreducible. However, states of matter such as solids, liquids, and gasses depend on the balance of the four elements in material entities and the environment. In other words, one has ice when it is cold, and when it is very hot, water evaporates into a gas. 

But the atoms themselves, according to Abhidharma typology of the Sarvastivadins do not undergo change or alteration. The Sautrantikas, you will see, reject the notion of partless atoms because they have are also claimed to have sides, etc. It is important to keep in mind that the root verses present a version of Sarvastivadin doctrine, that of the Vaibhāsikas. The commentaries mainly critiques these positions from the Sautrantika position.

Intrinsic characteristics do not conflict with dependent origination in Sarvastivada and Sautrantika tenets.

We are not resting in awareness, we are resting in the natural state of the mind, clarity and emptiness. We use mindfulness and awareness in tandem to sustain resting in the nature of the mind. We are aware of something in Dzogchen and Mahamudra, that is, a moment of unfabricated consciousness. But we are not resting in awareness per se. Mindfulness (dran pa) and awareness (shes bzhin) are two mental factors that always function together. If one is aware, one is mindful, if one is mindful, one is aware. Clarity on the other hand is not a mental factor, it is part of the nature of the mind, just as one aspect of the nature of water is wetness. But it is the nature of the mind is not only clarity, it is also empty, just as limpidity is also an aspect of the nature of water.

One of the features of secret mantra, which perhaps Nichiren did not like much (even though he was clearly quite adept at secret mantra practice as it exists in Tendai Mikkyo) is that its Japanese expression is clearly elitist, expensive, and requires a prodigious amount of education in mandala theory, mudra practice, and so on. But this is perhaps a reflection of how secret mantra was practiced in India during the late 7th and 8th centuries. In Tibet too, during the same period, secret mantra was very elitist, expensive, and so on. It was practiced basically the same way it was practiced in Japan. 

However, because Tibet is closer to India, the more populist expression of secret mantra in the HYT also made inroads, and of course, Dzogchen and later Mahāmudra, is part of that movement.

According to the Lo rgyus chen mo found in the Vima sNying thig, there was a person who trained under three nirmanakāya buddhas in three successive incarnations in the previous mahākalpa, and attained buddhahood himself. During the 20 void eons, this buddha remained latent since there was no manifest physical universe, etc. When the physical universe again manifested at the beginning of this mahākalpa, this buddha's dharmakāya manifested the sambhogakāya, etc., and also the first nirmankāya buddha of the first eon, Ngangwa Dampa, who taught the Sound Tantras as well as the remainder of the 17 tantras. 

Buddhas may have the same realization, but their omniscience is such thay they can distinguish between the different mind streams that led to their common realization. For example, if we are seated at the Met, looking at Monet's lily pond, we are all looking at the same painting, even though we arrived at different times from different places, and left to go to different destinations. We can understand the realizations of the buddhas just like that.

That does not matter. Let's say you have a house, and in your house is a million dollars. If you never discover the million dollars or it is never shown to you, you will have a million dollars and never know it. Likewise, unless those buddha qualities are discovered by you in a direct perception, or pointed out to you, even if you have them, they are of no use to you. 

As far as Dzogchen view goes, such qualities exist in the form of potential only. The analogy Longchenpa uses is that even though you may not need to gather the two accumulations ultimately in order to possess the kāyas and wisdoms, practicing the two accumulations is like polishing a dirty gem. One is not really adding anything new, but instead one is revealing what is already there, but hidden from ordinary sight.

Not really-- hence the various metaphors about paupers using rocks that hide wishfulfilling jewels as pillows, who die without recognizing they have been in possession of such a jewel the entire time.
