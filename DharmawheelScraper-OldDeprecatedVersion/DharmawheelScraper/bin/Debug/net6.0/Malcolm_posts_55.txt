You need to examine your attachment to the imputation you label "reality". That is the rabbit horn to which you are attached.

But part of the problem is that what you think is real is the external whole. You are happy to accept that your mental functioning creates an illusory identity, but you seem to think inert things like lettuce to be more real than your mind. Minds and lettuce however are of a piece, they are both depend phenomena and therefore, amount to no more than passing illusions.

And at the end of the day, we will still be left with the fact that all of these so called "things" are just imputations of identity onto impermanent collections, which themselves are composed of still further impermanent collections. 

So whatever clinging we have to any impermanent collection whether internal or external in terms of identity is certain to lead to suffering. This is the point of Madhyamaka i.e. to demonstrate that the beleif that attributions of identity onto impermanent collections are anything more than mere conventions is a delusion. 

Of course these conventions work, but they are no more real than the habit of the "I" we attribute to our personal collection of aggregates. The habit of "I" certainly works, but that "I" is not real. The imputation of salt onto a given collection we have chosen to call salt "works" but the "salt" can't be found apart from the imputation we make onto that collection so we can use it effectively. 

The problem most laypeople have with the MMK is that people rarely are acquainted with the views that MMK is seeking to correct. Without understanding Abhidharma, most of the arguments in the MMK will seem rather pointless if not obscure in the extreme. Some people mistakenly think that MMK is a panacea -- when it fact it is rather narrow text with a rather narrow project i.e. to correct Abhidharma realism and bring errant Abhidharmikas back to a proper understanding of dependent origination and help them to abandon a kind of naive essentialism that had crept into Buddhism. 

Madhyamaka as a whole is an excercise in trying to introduce people to the real meaning of dependent origination i.e. the emptiness of persons and phenomena based in the Buddha's observation that statements about existence and non-existence were at odds with the real meaning of dependent origination. 

Since there are no permanent phenomena, claims for the existence and non-existence of phenomena are completely naive on anything other than a conventional level. 

So you can keep insisting that salt harms snails as much as you like. Since you are making a conventional statement you are not going to get any complaint from me, but if you assert that there is saltiness in salt, for example, you have only two courses -- mire yourself in the myriad contradictions of asserting that there is an essence of salt or simply accede the point that "salt" is a conventional identity proposition that is at best a functional imputation and nothing more than that.

This is why for you saltiness is an inherent quality and intrinsic characteristic. But if you try to find salty in a salt molecule, you will not find it. 

Look at the examination of intrinsic characteristics in the MMK. 

but it is hopeless, you already decided you are a "realist" and that things "really exist". 

Madhyamaka is not antirealist, Madhyamaka is beyond the extremes of "real" and "unreal". 

Madhyamaka can be considered "antirealism" to the extent that realism is a wrong view, but not because Madhyamaka proposes there are "unreal" things. 

To change the terms a little, "It is not that we claim that things are unreal, we merely remove claims of real things". 

Salt is merely an imputation on a collection, but there is no real salt in salt. Dave is likewise an imputation on a collection, but there is no Dave in Dave. If would look for Dave in the collection called "Dave", where are we going to find it? In your head, brain, heart, liver, hand, etc? Apart from your head, liver, etc.? The same analysis of the person, by which we discover that persons are merely designations on a collection, must be extended to phenomena. That is the intent of Madhyamaka. In other words, just as the term car is merely a designation on a collection of parts, and not car is found in a car, likewise, we can make the same observation for all compounded phenomena. People are not one case and cars and salt another.

The difference is that not all Tibetans agree that this is all we are supposed to find, i.e. the non-existence of a "chos bden par sgrub pa", a truly existent phenomena. Many Tibetans assert, and have done so for centuries prior to Tsongkhapa, that not only are we to not find truly existent phenomena, we are indeed to find no phenomena at all which exist according to any of the four extremes. If these Tibetans are incorrect, then how can we accept the realization of any Tibetans prior to Tsongkhapa, or in any school that differs in opinion with his view? How are we for example to accept the realization of Atisha, Milarepa, etc.?

The emptiness of salt does not prove salt does not exist, it merely removes the claim that there is an existent called "salt" When salt is analyzed, no salt is found in salt. There is no entity among the components of salt that make salt salt. 

It is the same for any composite entity. We experience an appearance, we impute a label upon it, this act lets us work with that appearance. When we exame the appearance to find the basis for the label, however, none can be found. That non-finding is the emptiness of the appearance in question. 

There is some disagreement among Tibetans as to what we are not supposed to find.

Title: Re: Gorampa untenable according to Karmapa

The difference is that for Tsongkhapa, conventional truths are able to withstand ultimate analysis since all that is being analyzed is the subtle object of negation, inherent existence, not the existence, of a conventional truth. 

For Gorampa, they can not, since no phenonena can survive examination via the course object of negation, existence. Gorampa accepts that Candrakiriti specifically identifies (in the Prasannapāda) a subtle object of negation, but according to Gorampa, it is just a formal identification since inherent existence is automatically eliminated when existence itself is analyzed. 

According to Tsongkhapa, what is being misperceived by sentient beings in conventional truths is the inherent existence of conventional truths i.e. he claims that when an ordinary person sees a chair, they are seeing an inherently existent chair. However, Tsongkhapa also claims that ordinary sentient beings are incapable of distinguishing between mere existence and inherent existence. 

Gorampa points out that Tsongkhapa's first assertion is untrue, since inherent existences does not appear, and Tsongkhapa's second assertion is self-contradictory, sentient being only see existences, not inherent existences. 

Tsongkhapa replies that conventional truths are linguistic entities, mental imputations, and that therefore, the notion of inherent existence is embedded in all imputations of conventional truth. Gorampa counters that this interpretation of conventional truth is faulty, since in fact relative truths are first and foremost appearances to a deluded mind, and what such a deluded mind grasps is not a truly existent object, but rather a merely existing object, and imputations of inherency are confined to the philosophical speculations of scholars, not the naive imputations of ordinary persons such as Chai wallas, who would never imagine their tea cups had some intrinsic nature that made them teacups. 

So, at base, a large part of the disagreement hinges on how these two masters understand conceptual operations in sentient beings and what they understand Nagarjuna, Buddhapalita and Candrakirti to be saying about such conceptual operations. This is why Tsongkhapa places such importance on seperating and identifying the correct object of negation, and why Gorampa thinks that such an effort misses the point and is unnecessary, since the coarse object of negation is sufficient for removing wrong views via the classic tetralemma (in ordinary persons -- awakened persons have no need of the caturskoti).

One day Candrakirti was walking through a passageway in Nalanda, his head in a book, and he bumped his head on a pillar -- a student saw this and said "Aha! That pillar is not so empty, is it!". Candra looked at him, and passed his hand right through the pillar much to the student's embarassed astonishment. Or so this traditional story runs. 

Of course there is kashina meditation -- ostensibly, if you meditate on the kashina of earth, you gain control over the earth element and can travel through mountains, etc. 

It is my opinion that the apparent solidity of phenomena such as trees and rocks, etc., is directly related to the solidity of one's delusion. The more solid one's delusion, the more solid apparent phenomena seem. 

On the other hand, people with very solid delusions regularly kill themselves too, through not recognizing that solid things will kill them, like the ground when they attempt to fly off buildings. 

But is said also in the suttas that the Buddha once levitated to an elevation of 14 palm trees. Such yogic feats are described too often in Buddhist texts generation after generation for me to simply reject them out of hand.

Add to that:

And I would say you have a full deck. 

You see, in chapter 15 of MMK Nagaruna asks, where is there an existent not included in svabhāva (inherent existence) or parabhāva (dependent existence defined as a stealth version of svabhāva in the previous verse)? He then goes on to say that if existents are not established, then non-existents are not established, since a non-existent is normally defined by people as something which existed before, does not exist now. Having set this out, he then says, whoever has a view involving existents, non-existents, inherent existents or dependent existents does not understand Buddha's view. He then cites the Reply to Katyayana, the only sutra cited in the whole of the MML i.e. "The world is bound by a duality, "It is" and "It is not".

Content:
When one loosely rests vidyā in its own state, after coarse and subtle concepts come to calmly rest on their own, vidyā vividly abides in its own state. That śamatha is called “dwelling in the essence of vidyā”. In that state there is no lethargy or agitation in vidyā. Clarity, pristine lucidity, vividness, nakedness, and limpidity respectively cannot be seen with the eye, cannot be described with words, and cannot be established as a thing. The clarity that is like seeing, the pristine lucidity that is like an experience, the vividness that is like description, the nakedness that is like apprehending a thing, and the limpidity that is like a thought occurs in vidyā in and of itself. That alone is the wisdom of vipaśyāna. Though śamatha and vipaśyāna are given two separate names, in essence there is no difference.

A kṣanas is the most fundamental unit of time in Buddhism. The duration of a kṣanas is the duration of a thought. So if you do the math:

120 kṣanas equals on tatkṣana; 60 tatkṣanas equal a lava; 30 lava equal a muhurta; 30 muhurtas equal an ahorata, which is a single 24 hour period of time. So, according to Buddhist principles then, a moment of thought has a duration of 0.0013 seconds.

Yes, my point was is that there are two kinds of dravya in Buddhism, rūpa and nāma, material dravya, and mental dravya. What you said was that Science and Buddhism where in agreement that the former existed and the latter does not. I think this a false statement. 

Some scientists, like Dennet, et al, are certainly of the opinion that there is no such a thing as a mind at all. 

One of more impressive western scholars on the question of the hard problem of consiousness is Colin McGinn, whom I once had the pleasure of hearing speak. He argues, pretty well in my opinion, that the nature of consciousness is cognitively closed to human minds i.e. that in some sense we are frogs in a well and that our view is limited to what we can see out of the top of it.

The unwillingness to entertain the idea that yogis may possess knowledge that cannot be tested for in a lab is a form of lacking of curiosity. Thinking that PET scans, etc., prove that the mind is merely an epiphenomenal illusion is simply fundamentalist physicalism. The only thing these experiments prove is what Buddhists have been saying all along, mind and matter can interact, conventionally speaking. Pet scans don't work on formless realm beings. You would assert it is because they don't exist. Buddhists would assert that it is because they do not have physical bodies. As I said, you can only verify their existence yogically. You cannot share that perception directly in an empirical or testable fashion, because not everyone has the same capacity to do develop the necessary skills to perceive devas in the form and formless realms.

Fourth, it physically addictive, which means your body will start to crave it, and this craving is distracting.

This is the point of view of physicalism ala Dennet, etc. And I do not think it is accurate at all. MRI, PET scans, etc., don't measure the mind. They measure the brain's bloodflow, etc., but they do not measure minds.

Mind and soul differentiated in Buddhism; the former exists, the latter do not. The former is an impermanent dependent phenomena; the latter is permananent, non-dependent phenomena. 

But the cause and condition of a mind is not a brain, from a Buddhist perspective. But this discussion of differneces in POV between Buddhism and physicalism is a bit off topic.

Our bodies, essentially, are composed of rtsal which is expressed in our ignorance as the five outer and inner elements. 

When pracitioners eat the flesh of those who have been killed (necessarily by someone else, not at our specific encouragement, nor have we seen the animal killed) a postive cause is created for this being. Why? Because a connection is made through the field of rtsal which also includes minds. 

Since we don't eat anything but cattle, pigs, goats, sheep, fowl, fish and seafood, these animals are in some sense luckier than others, they are more closely associated with human beings, and more likely to wind up in the diet of practitioners. 

It is not a question of ability, it is question of knowledge. When you know how everything is connected through rtsal, then such questions about the mechanisms by which a practitioner consuming the flesh of some unfortunate animal benefits that animal becomes very obvious. 

The reason why Ganapujas have a powerful effect is that there is no more power an offering than offering to the Guru. If your ganapuja is just a dry ritual, then of course it will have little benefit.

The basis is original purity. The Unwritten Tantra states:

“There is no object to investigate within the view of self-originated wisdom: nothing went before, nothing happens later, nothing is present now at all. Action does not exist. Traces do not exist. Ignorance does not exist. Mind does not exist. Prajñā does not exist. Samsara does not exist.  Nirvana does not exist. Even vidyā itself does not exist i.e. nothing at all appears in wisdom. That arose from not grasping anything.”

However, Prasaga is an intellectual view. Dzogchen is not and that is the main difference between the two.

Yes.

As I have stated elsewhere, Dzogchen cosmology is just a minor variation on the standard abhidharma cosmology. In Abhidharmakośa, at the end of the eon, all sentient beings are reborn in the two upper form realms, where their minds are in a state of dharmatā. After twenty anatarakalpas, intermediate eons, because of traces of latent afflictions, the air mandala forms and so on, resulting in a container universe which is repopulated by sentient beings who take birth in it from top to bottom. 

In Dzogchen, at the end of the previous mahākalpa, all sentient beings attain "buddhahood" after taking birth in the Kalavinkaloka. Then after twenty thousand eons while samsara and nirvana does not appear (this is called the bardo (antara) of samsara and nirvana in dzogchen texts), because of the lingering traces of affliction and action left over from the last eon, the basis becomes stirred, the five lights shine out and there is a chance for recognition or non-recognition by the neutral awareness(es) that is/are obscured by the innate ignorance of mere non-recognition while the basis is in a latent state. Depending on the fact of recognition or non-recognition, there is Samantabhadra and sentient beings. 

Thus, we understand that the basis has two phases, active and latent. During the bardo of samsara and nirvana, it is in a latent phase.

Imputing ignorance [kun brtags ma rig pa] reifies the basis as a self and an other. This ignorance does not exist in the basis, has never existed in the basis and will never exist in the basis. Nevertheless, the basis, nature, essence and compassion, serve as its cause in the sense that it is the basis which is reified. However, the basis itself is free from reification and therefore any sort of enumeration. Even the notion of three wisdoms of essence, nature and compassion is merely a way of talking about the basis which in fact has one essence. 

Individuals occur because the basis was not recognized at the beginning of the eon, when the neutral awareness [shes pa lung ma bstan, jñāvyakrta] in the basis became conscioussness [rnam shes, vijñāna] through not recognizing the basis as its own state due to the imputing ignorance mentioned above. When that nuetral awareness recognizes the basis as its own display, it becomes prajñā [shes rab] through knowing [rig pa, vidyā] the basis as its own display, there is effortless buddhahood in the state of realization called "Samantabhadra". 

Sentient beings in others words are merely a continuation of ignorance about our own true state. 

The answer of course is that inviduals are neither the same nor different than the basis. If they were the same, the basis would afflicted, if they were utterly different, sentient beings could not becomes buddhas through recognizing the basis as their own state. 

Also bear in mind that the term "basis" is applied to the three wisdoms because they have not been realized. When the three wisdoms are realized, then they are termed the fruit and one rests on the stage of great original purity, uttarajñāna, highest wisdom.

Irreducibility is held to be the criteria for establishing identity. Identity is the basis for establishing the reality of a given thing. If the identity of a given thing cannot be etablished for that thing because a given thing can still be reduced and analyzed, that thing's reality depends on non-analytical acceptance (hence a convention). Assuming that no phenomena can bear ultimate analysis,  a given thing's reality is an imputation based upon an appearance that has not been subject to ultimate analysis.

If someone comes to me with doubts, I generally send that person back to their teacher. In Padma's case, he should try and get his hands on ChNN's Upadesha on All-Penetrating Wisdom (ye shes zang thal), Longsal Series Volume three. If he attended the recent webcast, ChNN gave the Longsal transmission of Yeshe Zangthal in the last open retreat, not the lung, but the transmission. This book also contains the Longsal Ngondro for which ChNN gave the lung in the last retreat. So he should have no trouble procuring this text. I personally found this one short text to be something like a key that deepened my understanding of Dzoghen beyond tregchö and unlocked the meaning of many tantras. 

BTW, in tregchö, that is it. All you are doing just totaly relaxing in a state of instant presence. It does not make anything better but if you are relaxed, you don't mind, also if things are better, you don't mind. If you are not being relaxed, then you are not understanding the main point of tregchö. So you must learn and apply the four chozhags. Cog (ཅོག) is an ancient Tibetan word that means all. It also means to have leisure. Shag (གཞག) means to let go. So this is why ChNN translates this as total relaxation. There are four points of cogzhag which should be applied together at the same time. It is not hard to learn what this means, as I recall ChNN talked about this in the last retreat.

Title: Re: Orthodoxy in Vajrayana
Content:
There are ten criteria that define a valid tantra, for example. But the Dzogchen tradition throws them away. 

The real difference between sutra and tantra is the following: yoga tantra and highest yoga tantra has a method based on transmission of an example wisdom communicated by a guru, a physiologically based understanding of meditation and the path, a concept of wisdom being physicaly embodied in the center of the body, the theory of mind and vāyu interactivity; teachings on ṇāḍī, vāyu and bindu which is crucial to tantric praxis, the so called body method. All of these features are almost completely lacking in lower and non-Vajrayāna teachings. 

As far as transmission goes, the Nyingmapas argue that all Mahāyāna teachings are treasure texts. The gsar ma schools were predicated on bringing back new Indian texts. So Sakya, Gelug and Jonang tend to emphasize the new tantras as being more authentic since they have a clearer Indian pedigree. Kagyus go both ways, historically -- that is to say. Nyingmapas have developed various polemics to defend continued text production. Basically, the Nyingma collection of tantras is not closed, the Kengyur and Tengyur are closed. I am a student of three different tertons who have produced "new" tantras. 

One cannot separate transmission from the teaching. The transmission is true if a) the teacher teaching it has personal realization of the teaching, or his lineage is unbroken. The first is the best of course, but most people get the latter. Of course there are no guarantees at all.

If you wish to understand Madhyamaka, then I, among others can help you here. Some of us, like myself, have formal training in the field. 

But there is nothing in Buddhism to redesign. Buddhism is all about understanding dependent origination. Some people's understanding of dependent origination is deeper than that of others. Those who still cling to existents as real necessarily have shallower understanding of dependent origination than those who understand that the final implication of dependent origination is that existents, though apparent, are not real in any meaningful and ultimate sense.

Not exactly, a truth is "an object of a cognition" -- you cannot leave the cognition part off since it is integral to the definition. A truth is not merely an object, it is an object defined as relative or utlimate depending upon whether the cognition is deceived or undeceived. One object, two natures, hence two cognitions, correct and false. 

This is an development over the Abhidharmic concept of a truth, in which a truth [satya] is a cognition, for example, a cognition of water is a relative truth, whereas a cognition of the characteristics of water, limpidity, wetness and coolness, are ultimate truths. 

In other words, here,in Abhidharma, an ultimate truth is defined as the irreducible cognition that remains after something (such as a cup or water) has been subjected to complete analysis. 

There really isn't than much difference between this and the Madhyamaka definition. The Madhyamaka definition might run something like "...an ultimate truth is defined as the object of an unmistaken cognition that remains after something (such as a cup or water) has been subjected to complete analysis."

The emphasis in both causes, both in Abhidharma and Madhyamaka is on the cognition. So no, I do not agree with the MS discussion in all respects.

Gorampa was not a Dzogchen pracitioner at all. He was a Sakyapa. He rejected the authenticity of kun byed rgyal po, and so on. 

But anyway, it does not matter. Pre-Yogacara Madhyamakas [i.e. pre Shantarakṣita] accepted the standard cognitive model of Abhidharma, so for them it was proper to speak of objects, organs and sense consciousnesses. So in fact your whole line of inquiry is in vain. For them, there were, conventionally speaking, given objects in precisely the terms to which you object. For them, from Nagarjuna onwards, without the meeting of a cup, for example, and a healthy eye organ [i.e a functional patch of atoms in the shape of a flax flower in the back of the eye], and an eye consciousness operating through that sense organ, there could be no eye-consciousness of a cup at all. Three things are required for an instance of vision, in the Madhyamaka model. 

Face it, my statement was just not a problem from a classical Madhyamaka point of view so I am not going to spend anymore time on this. Why? Because this is non-controversial.

The reason why we say that there is a true and false relative truth, is as I explained it above. The former is mistaken concerning the nature of an apparent object; the latter is mistaken about the apparent object itself.

Perhaps we do not mean the same thing by entity. Here I am using "entity" simply to mean an apparent. 

If you mean by an "entity" something which possesses being, then we are in agreement —&nbsp; any perception predicated on perceiving an entity as existent is an incorrect cognition. 

Apparents are a given, that is what it means when Nagarjuna states that one understands ultimate truth through relative truth. If they are not a given that the classical statement "Matter is empty, emptiness is matter..." etc., is unintelligible. 

We have to have "given" objects because we do not reject appearances in classical Madhyamaka. We understand that appearances arise in dependence. What we reject about appearances is not the appearance itself, rather, that it has any underlying realty. For example, a moon in the water. 

This is quite different than yogacara where appearances themselves in their totality are rejected.

What Candrakirti is saying is that Nagarjuna is saying that any given entity someone perceives can be perceived either correctly or incorrectly. 

Among incorrect perceptions of objects there is a further subdivision; true relative truth and false relative truth. A true relative truth is somethat that is efficient and producing a result, for example, a wheat seed that produces a wheat sprout. Such observed efficiency provides the basis for consensus reality. False relative truths are conventional delusions, for example, a drunk who has doubled vision or a juandice patient who perceives everything as yellowed. 

Ultimate truths are always true no matter the context. Relative truths are contextual. For example, the relative truth of the speed of light breaks down when gravitational conditions are altered the event horizon of a black hole, for example. However, we can connect these relative truths on a continuum by understand their context so they remain generally true even when they are not specificially true.

No, what you said as that the imputed identity was parikalpita. Look back at what you said. 

The three own natures have to do with how objects themselves are deluded cognitions (parikalpita) i.e. mental states (caittas) which arise from the activation of seeds (bijas) stored in the alayavijñāna (paratantra). When those appearances are recognized as being mere mental states, and non-existent in the ālayavijñāna itself, then the ālayavijñāna transforms into wisdom (parinispanna). Paratantra only refers to the ālayavijñāna.

Basically, if you want to talk about Yogacara this is not the thread to do it. 

As I said, what I stated it basically pulled directly from MAv -- and as you know, Candra, later in this text, demolishes the three own nature thoery altogether.

First things first -- truths (satyas) are objects of cognitions -- which can be either correct (ultimate) or false (relative). Since you are studying Gelug influenced discourse, this may not be immediately evident to you. 

This means that if you see something that you identify as salt, and it functions as salt, this cognition is true in so far as it is efficient. 

When you analyze that appearance for some fundamental saltiness in that appearance of salt, that cognition of salt fails because no fundamental saltiness will or can be found. In other words, relative truths are true so long as they are not investigated, that is, so long as the appearance which produces the cognition which lables that appearance is not analyzed to discover whether or not there is an essence which produces the identification of the given appearance in question. 

A relative truth is the subject of a cognition that is not in possession of the fact that the given apparent phenomena being perceived as an object of said cognition lacks the identity imputed to it. An ultimate truth is an object of a cogniton which is in possession of the fact that the given apparent phenomena being perceived as an object of said cognition lacks the identity imputed to it and does not perceive the identity which is non-existent in that object of cognition. 

The function of the two truths is to lead to the cessation of proliferation about identity. The lack of identity within phenomena and persons alone is emptiness and nothing else.

There are two systems of realizing mahāmudra: the two stages or guru yoga. Mahāmudra is based on direct introduction in both cases. Apart from that, there is no other Mahāmudra. 

Some people like to talk about a sutra mahāmudra, but it is very clear that was elaborated by Gampopa for people he felt were not ready for real Mahāmudra teachings. Not only have I read this, but this was also kindly explained to me by Khenpo Tsultrim Gyatso personally.

BTW, since this is just the "Mahāmudra" forum -- it is not the sole province of Kagyupas. Sakyas, Gelugs, Nyingmapas also have teachings on Mahāmudra. So in no way can the Kagyu perspective on Mahāmudra be considered definitive or all-embracing -- all schools of Tibetan Buddhism have lineages and teachings on Saraha's original Sahaja Mahāmudra. But only Kagyu and later, Gelug, have teachings on a system termed sutra mahāmudra. Sutra mahāmudra is not bad -- in fact, it is quite a good system -- but in reality it is just a name for perfection of wisdom teachings with some effort made to correlate the view of the tantras and the dohas with the view of sutra.

The path of such Indian mahāsiddhas was the two stages. Mahāmudra was the result experienced by these Indian mahāsiddhas from practicing the two stages which is why Saraha,  Tilopa and Naropa passed on so many tantric practices (especially, Cakrasamvara, which begins with Saraha). 

Sahaja Mahāmudra, according to the great Drugpa Kagyu master Gyalba Yanggonpa, is Gampopa's own system. So you really cannot claim that Kagyu Mahāmudra is any more Indian that the Dzogchen you are criticizing. 

In fact, if anything, the Dzogchen you are criticizing is, from a western textual perspective, a bit earlier than Kagyu Mahāmudra. Chetsun Senge Wangchuk achieved rainbow body in 1128, having passed on his teachings to lCegom Nagpo and Shangton, just to put things in perspective. By this time the 17 tantras and the Dzogchen Nyingthig system were fully articulated. Milarepa passed in 1135. Milarepa's teachings became famous, in part, because his student Gampopa spread the fame of his teacher among Kadampas and secured the reputation of the Kagyu school. Nyinthig continued in obscurity in western Tsang largely, I imagine, because it became a family lineage of the lCe clan (Lcegom Nagpo, etc) and the Zhang clan (Zhangton, his son Zhangkhas Nyibum, etc.). 

While I am not going to knock the practice the two stages, for me, Dzogchen is more interesting.

Generally speaking it works like this -- if you read books by Kagyus, Mahāmudra and Dzogchen are the same. If you read books by Nyingmapas, they are different, and Kagyu Mahāmudra is just Dzogchen sems sde in drag. Sakyapas happily admit Dzogchen and Mahāmudra are different (where they are not shunning it as a Hashang deviation) and charitable Gelugpas like HHDL try to convince everyone that the fundamental mind of clear light and Dzogchen are the same. 

Me, I stick with what ChNN says about the issue (i.e. Dzogchen and Mahāmudra are completely different, with different paths and so on).

Well, except that modern authors, like Dudjom R., ridiculed the Tibetan tendency to dismiss "Tibetan" tantras just because they were "Tibetan", pointing out there was no good reason to assume that Indians were more realized by nature than Tibetans. 

Now then, there is certainly good reason to dismiss a "Tibetan" teaching if you find that it does not meet your criteria for a useful teaching. 

ince I have no vested interest in harmonizing this or that teaching with some other teaching, I am free to examine each teaching based on its merits and from its terminological perspective. 

The fact is that I think that Dzogchen is more interesting than other teachings and more relevant and more profound for a ton of reasons space will not allow me to expand upon. 

Jñāna seems to think that just because people use similar terms they must mean the same thing or have the same path. But we know this is a very faulty and problematical perspective. This kind of thinking has lead to reams of improper refutation -- for example, Gelugpas refuting Lamdre and Dzogchen on an equal footing as mind-only school proponents, (not to mention Kagyu Mahāmudra) because both Dzogchen and Lamdre use the term "ālaya" (albeit in different ways)

My sole point which set this off is that the basis discussed in dzogchen and the basis discussed in mahāmudra are not the same since the path is not the same. Is it the case that tregchö  and mahāmudra are very similar? Yes -- but tregchö&nbsp;is not summum bonum of Dzoghen. 

But according to Jñāna, we should ignore tögal because, according to him, it and man ngag sde has no "Indian" antecedent (as if that is even important).

Honestly, I think this analysis by this master is a bit misleading -- he is trying to assert that gzhi described by Dzogchen has an equivalent counterpart in the kun gzhi of the Mahāmudra system. However, if you read any straight mahāmudra manual, for example, Dagpo Tashi Namgyal's texts or Sakyapa presentations and so on, for them the basis [gzhi] is the all-basis [kun gzhi], the clear and empty nature of the mind. It is called the all-basis because when it is not recognized, it is the basis for samsara, and when it is recognized, it is the basis for nirvana. 

On the other hand, you have Dzogchen texts that systematically differentiate between gzhi and kun gzhi. The reason for this is not arbitrary and have everything to do with the path of Dzogchen. These topics are not mentioned at all in any system of Mahāmudra since they form no part of Mahāmudra practice. The system of differentiating mind and wisdom (sems and ye shes) in Mahāmudra is not the same as differentiating between mind and vidyā in Dzogchen and does not have the same intention.

You know what? We really do not know this to be a fact. All we know for sure is that the earliest texts we see for these practices (klong sde and man ngag sde) that we have access to seem to date from around the mid 10th century onward. But it is very hard to date this material. There is also a kama transmission for thögal which is held to date to the 8th century that consists of just a page or two where it forms part of the completion stage of KIlaya/Yangdag. 

Anyway, even if man ngag sde did prove to be a later elboration, it does not matter. Jñāna seems to evince a preference for Indian authored material. That's ok, but I do not see Indian authorship as proof of superior content, or Tibetan authorship of inferior content.

Look, if you decide that Mahāmudra is an older terminology, then you have to accept that the authors of man ngag sde class (which defines essence, nature and compassion) were familiar with this older terminology of the ālaya/kun gzhi, found it lacking and had a different aim in their writing. In other words, you have to accept that Dzogchen terminology is different and has a different intent on the basis of the claim that it is different. You have to accept the fact that the  Indian-derived Sarma notions of the all-basis was inadequate for the purposes of Dangma Lhungyal and Chetsun Senge Wangchug, for example (should we take these persons to be the original authors and collators of the 17 Tantras and Vima Nyinthig), and that therefore, these authors chose to elaborate a terminology to express their differences.

Title: Re: Buddhism and Peak Oil
Content:
Peak oil is a very misunderstood term. Peak oil refers not to the total amount of oil in the ground, rather it refers to the total amount of _easily recoverable oil_(or any other mineral resource). 

There is a relationship between the high price of oil and drilling for oil in places where it expensive to recover, or the cost of extracting it (think shale oil and hydro fraking (which is not just about gas)) is very high. 

When the price of oil rises too high however, it triggers recession, demand drops off, prices decline, and it becomes too pricey to drill for oil in exotic places (like the deep gulf). 

Basically, what peak oil is really about is the energy return on energy investment (EROI). In 19th century, the ratio was roughly 50 to one i.e. for barrel of oil or equivalent amount of energy, one could recover fifty barrels of oil. Presently, the EROI is between one to five barrels of for each BOE invested. 

What peak oil theory is actually about is not the actual amount of oil that exists in the ground, it is a critique of the economic feasability of extracting oil from ever more difficult places to reach it. 

Hubbert's basic contention is sound:

"Our principal constraints are cultural. During the last two centuries we have known nothing but exponential growth and in parallel we have evolved what amounts to an exponential-growth culture, a culture so heavily dependent upon the continuance of exponential growth for its stability that it is incapable of reckoning with problems of nongrowth."

When EROI drops below one BOE, it becomes very unfeasible to invest in any new petroleum recovery. That is what peak oil is actually about. When it is no longer profitable for oil companies to recover oil, then all the dominos begin to fall...

"Because Americans are very arrogant and their capitalism’s-habit is to think they are very superior to everyone else. They don’t respect other races, and other cultures. They are nationalistic. National - how do you say? Chauvinistic. It is another manifestation of a nihilist view. But the West has no pure Buddhist lineage because they don't respect sublime beings, and they don't believe in teachers.Whatever they do not understand deeply, then they reject, and they say, "This is useless". The problem is how pure Buddhist teachings can flourish in the west.
...
I cannot say, neither they are or are not because I am not a sublime teacher. But main problem is that almost all Western teachers of Buddhism are nihilists. 

This is what I do not accept. I know many Americans, the vast majority of them are not arrogant and do not think they are better than anyone else. 

If nationalism is a fault, it applies to all -- including, and especially Tibetans. 

The western Buddhists I know respect sublime persons and they do beleive in teachers. 

If we are not understanding some teaching deeply, that is the fualt of the teachers. But the way many Tibetans want it, is that one should have total faith before receiving teachings. This will not work in the West. And this was also not Buddha's intention. 

So I find myself in disagreement with this point of view. 

I also do not accept the blanket condemnation that almost all Western teachers of Buddhism are nihilists.

The real Prajn̄āpāramita is not the several volumes of texts in the Tripitika, it is experience of inexpressible emptiness.

No, this leads to far too many contradictions because there are far too many contradictory sutras. For this reasons, in terms of sutra hermeneutics we are given the famous formula:

Follow the dharma, not the person;
the meaning, not the words;
the definitive meaning, not the provisional meaning;
wisdom, not conceptuality. 

Again, the ultimate authority is personal experience. 

In terms of what I offered you, since it is hard to understand the sutras and tantras, you need to rely on oral instruction. In order to rely on oral instruction, you need a teacher. But in order to confirm the teacher's instruction is correct, you need your experience of the path. So again, in the end, experience is the final authority in dharma. 

And Buddha wanted it that way.

Nope. The Sakya school, for example, teaches four authorities: text, oral instruction, guru, and experience. 

Of those four, it is only the last that confirms the first three as authoritative. This is why the buddha instructs us that he cannot remove our suffering, or hand us liberation, but only show us the path. 

And for that reason, I instruct my students to rely on their experience rather than some words in a book. Why, because I am a practitioner who has  confirmed the truth of the essence of the dharma in my own experience, and that was not based on some words in a book.

Sutras and tantras are secondary to personal experience. This is why a Buddhism fundamentalism is impossible. We can certainly use sutras to illustrate our points, but there is no settled 'canon".

Once you have settled on whatever practice you are interested in, there is not much point, apart from academic interest, in pursuing other school's teachings. 

Also there is a question of terminology and hermenuetics -- Sino-Japanese hermeneutics are not compatible to a large degree with Indo-Tibetan hermeneutics -- their interpretive criteria are simply too different to make comparisons meaningful. For example, take the perennial debate about Chan in Tibetan Buddhism. Anyone who has studied Dzogchen deeply knows that Dzogchen and Chan are not related. But for all of that, there is superficial rhetoric that causes people to consistently conflate the two. 

Also the deep differences between Tibetan Buddhism and Sino-Japanese Buddhism sometimes render influences of one upon the other hard to see, for example, underlying current of debt Kagyu Mahāmudra systems own to Chan Buddhism via such texts as the Vajrasamadhi sutra. It is also a contention of certain Tibetan scholars that Chan is influenced by Dzogchen (via Tun Huang). 

Whatever the case may be, what we usually observe is people moving through schools and practices until they find people they like and with whom they feel comfortable. I know many people who like Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche's teachings, but do not feel welcome in Dzogchen Community, and so they do not stay -- the DC simple does not address their emotional and social needs. And these two latter factors, the meeting of emotional and social needs, I would argue, are far more important than doctrine in terms of why people select the practices and lineages they do, over all.

Correct -- no one school "owns" Dzogchen, though since it entered Tibet in the old promulgation period, and is associated with the treasure tradition, it has come to be seen as a "Nyingma" teaching.

In point of fact, it is rather the other way around. Tantric Buddhist ritual provided a structure and syntax around which Himalayan "shamans" constructed many rites derived from Buddhism. But to some extent it was also a two way street, with aboriginal poeples in India and the Himalayas being influenced by Tantric ritual and influencing Tantric ritual. It is mostly the former, however, and not the latter.

Because, if you dissemble, pretend that you think everyone's pratice is the same, people will eventually find out you are schmoozing and they will think you are dishonest. 

If you take the other approach, which is to admit up front that our tradition has some major triumphalist rhetoric, then people may not like it, but they can't fault you later when they do find out that it is true. 

In other words, since this type of hierchical approach to Buddhist teachings exist in Tibetan Buddhism from the start, it is better to just be open about it. 

Now, you personally may not buy into it, but since the nine yānas hierarchy is there, and since it is embedded into our tradtion, it is a little too much to insist that people not speak from the point of view of the teachings they follow. To be quite honest with you, as far as I am concerned, it gives an honest assessment, if terse, of the key points of the teachings of various schools and shows what their limitations are.

All Yanas are valuable and useful, hence the term "yāna". 

The best approach is honesty. Everyone thinks their version of Buddhism is the best, otherwise, they would not practice it. A true ecumenical spirit recognizes this. We are not trying to sell anything. Your stated approach seems to bear with it a concern for the consumer. The reality is that people wind up with the practice and teachers they have a connection with and no other. 

Whether it is three yānas of the new tantra school, or the nine yānas of Nyingma, and so on, we don't need to worry about people being turned off to this or that. People can always find a reason not to like something.

The nine yānas sets out a heirarchy of capacity and ability. That is the whole point of the system -- to grade various Buddhist practices in a hierarchy. 

They are not arbitrary assignations, incidentally, but assignations found in the tantras. 

If you want to consider the Nyingma system derogatory, please go ahead by all means. And yes, Vipassana, Madhyamaka, Zen, Pure Land, Kriya Tantra, Yoga Tantra and so on all find their place within the nine yānas somewhere, and of course, none of them are at the head of it.

Not true. This is why the explanation of any translated Dharma text requires special skills. 

One has to strike a balance between readability and over-glossing a term. In many cases, it is better to select a simple translation that indicates to the explainer a broader range of meaning, which then can act as a hook to remind the person who has received the explanation of the text in question of the broader explanation. 

Take a term like mngon sum. It means completely different things depending on how it is used -- but in general, always refers to actually witnessing an event. Sometimes, as in logic, direct perception is better. Sometimes, like when discussing a visionary experience, "personally saw guru rinpoche" meaning that Guru P actually showed up and you saw him in person, as opposed to a dream. Or in Dzogchen, when discussing the first of the four visions, here it means having a personal experience of vidyā as a visual phenomena, seeing a thigle. 

In the latter case, if you translate chose nyid mgon sum as direct perception of dharmatā, someone who has no idea about Dzogchen will understand this to be a reference the path of seeing (which it is not).  For that matter, even the meaning of dharmatā is different, which is why in so many dzogchen texts, when discussing dharmatā ala sutra style, the term stong pa nyid is always appended i.e. chos nyid stung pa nyid, to make the distinction between dharmatā as ye shes or rig pa in the visions. 

Ideally of course you would want everything to be easily understood, but in practice this is far more difficult than you imagine. Something simple have to be explained beyond the translation equivalent you select.

Wisdom = ye shes. 

This is a subtle point of Dzogchen most people do not pay attention to. There is very little difference between Dzogchen cosmology and Abhidharma cosmology. But there is a slight difference. In Dzogchen cosmology all sentient beings achieve buddhahood. 

But....there are two kinds of buddhahood discussed in Dzogchen; buddhahood that reverts to the cause and the buddhahood that does not revert the cause. 

Those whose buddhahood was incomplete can still fall into sentient being hood if they do not recognize the arising of the basis as being their own display. 

According to the commentary on the སྲས་གཅིག་པུ་རྒྱུད by Garab Dorje in the Vima Nyinthig, the basis arises because of traces of latent affliction and action left over from the previous eon. At that time, one either recognizes the stirring of the basis or not.

Of course they arose together -- there was a state prior to both. When Samantabhadra recognized his state, we did not recognize ours. 

Actually, an argument can be made that avidyā precedes vidyā because even Samantabhadra experienced the innate ignorance.

In any case, the essential point is that vidyā and avidyā are completely different. Avidyā depends on vidyā in the sense that the three wisdoms of the basis are the "cause" of ignorance. They are the cause of ignorance in the sense that at the time vāyu stirred in the basis, the three wisdoms were not recognized and samsara and nirvana started from that point.

First, this is defining the all-basis, based on a citation from the sgra thal gyur:

The definition: "all" (kun) is a collection;
basis (gzhi) is accumulating and gathering...

So here, ignorance is being defined as the all-basis. When that all basis is divided into four, the first is "...the ever-present actual all-basis is the aspect that arose at the same time on top of vidyā from the start, like gold and tarnish, the avidyā that depends on vidyā (rig pa la ltos nas ma rig pa), i.e."

The point is not different than what I outlined above, there is never ignorance in the basis; even though ignorance can cover over the basis. That ignorance is called the "all-basis". The basis and the all-basis are completely different. 

After giving the definitions of the four types of all-basis, Longchenpa then goes on to analyze assertions such as the assertion that the all-basis is stained vidyā, etc.

Wisdom can serve as a "cause" for ignorance in the sense that it comes from the non-recognition of wisdom. But even the example you give shows that ignorance is not a part of wisdom no more than the tarnish is a part of the gold.

Dzogchen states that basis is free from ignorance from the very beginning. All of our deluded experience comes from not recognizing the basis itself. There is no ignorance in the basis. The Transcendence of Sound states:

in the essence, the wisdom of original purity.

The Letterless states:
Since my self-originated wisdom is pure of delusion from the start, it is beyond the extremes of being and non-being.

Also the Luminous Clarity states:

The essence, the wisdom of original purity,
is free from the stain of ignorance

The Rosary of Pearls states very clearly:

The mere term delusion cannot be described
within the original purity of the initial state,
likewise, how can there be non-delusion?
Therefore, pure of delusion from the beginning.

The Tarkajvala asserts the following. 

"The unconditioned is the two cessations, space and suchness"

The unconditioned is analytical cessation and non-analytical cessation, space and suchness. Analytical cessation is discriminating wisdom i.e. having analyzed and extinguished the evident afflictions, that analysis and cessation is given the name "nirvana". Non-analytical cessation is when a given thing is never separate from cessation by any means. Space opens up room and has the characteristic of being unobstructed. Suchness previously did not exist, nor come to not exist through destruction, is not [presently] mutually dependent and has no basis. Those four are permanent because their nature is unchanging. 

Since emptiness and tathāta are synonyms, it is a little hard to prove that emptiness is conditioned.

If you like setting out water offerings, sense offering, medicine and blood, tormas and so on -- go for it -- but it is not absolutely necessary. After all, the universe is a torma according to the torma tantra.

discussing the protectors and their role is not a samaya breakage. It is silly to presume so. Greg, if your Lama thinks so, that is his opinion but has no relevance to me.

I didn't say that liberation was a result of cause and effect. It isn't. Liberation is a result of knowledge, knowing what your actual state is and integrating that knowledge. In the meantime, while you are integrating that knowledge, it is important to recognize and observe how you are living in a dualistic condition and behaving in a manner which takes that into account, rather than slipping into the ravine of denying afflictive cause and effect which is our present condition.

You are quite wrong about this. This is why I said you are veering towards a "Dzogchen" nihilism. Merit and rebirth are both integral to Dzogchen. This is, for example, why there are so many purification practices aimed at removing causes for taking rebirth in the six realms and so on. This is why there is a detailed account of why you will achieve liberation in nirmanakāya buddhafields if you do not manage to achieve liberation in this life or in the bardo.

The potion you are missing is that as long as you are under the influence of afflictions, you will engage in actions. Actions will result in suffering. The purpose of accumulating merit (from a Dzogchen perspective) is to maintain higher rebirth in samsara and create favorable conditions for meeting the teachings, and of course, to dedicate it to others. 

What you are veering towards is a sort of "Dzogchen" nihilism that will just ruin your path.

It is so silly to make this argument considering that every name and picture of  virtually every major protector has been spread far and wide on the internet. 

Everyone knows knows that the ma-za-dam sum are the main protectors of Dzogchen. This is not a big secret.

You can not think yourself out of ignorance. You can not declare, "I am perfect" and then expect to awaken. 

What you have to understand is the basis. The reason the basis is called "the basis" is because it has not been realized.

As I said, this all depends on the opinions of this or that Lama. 

No one here is discussing the guardians frivolously. 

The idea that saying the name "rahula" breaks samaya is quite ridiculous.

But you did not recognize your nature, and so, under the influence of ignorance, you fall into duality and enter into actions, thus never escaping from samsara. 

Another way of putting it that I noticed in a Dzogchen text the other day "Vidyā is seeing the substance of the mind. Avidyā is not seeing the substance of the mind". We mostly continue in a state of avidyā.

If you think someone is genuinely interested, suggest a book for them to read. If they buy, they are actually interested, if not, they were just being polite.

Guardians exist to protect the teachings and assist practitioners. 

As long as you have the lung for the practices, you can do them. 

There are many different traditions around how to relate to guardians, most of the them based on the opinions of this or that lama. This is why there is no standard rule about it. So -- in the Dzogchen Community, if you do the short thun, then you always do guardian practice. 

If you are following the ChNN's teachings, pay no attention to what those are not students of the ChNN say about guardians.

Sure it does. It creates a trace. 

This is why I put འ༔ ཨ༔ ཤ༔ ས༔ མ༔ ཧ༔ in my signature. These are the representation of the six munis in the six lokas in the form of syllables. The syllables enter the eye of the person who sees them and this creates the connection for them to be liberated.
