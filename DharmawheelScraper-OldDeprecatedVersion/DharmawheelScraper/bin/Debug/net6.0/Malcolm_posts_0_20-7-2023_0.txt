Well, no. It is now well established that hatha yoga was borrowed by HIndus (See Jim Mallinson's research) from Vajrayāna Buddhism, and things like vāyus, nāḍīs, and so on are part of the common Indian medical milieu.

What we don't find is family lineages in the Tibetan style, modeled on the style of brahmins, like the Khon. There wasn't any need for such family lineages in India because of the central role brahmins played in the ritual life of Indians. 

The only such kula lineages I am aware of are Shakti family lineages in Hinduism. I suppose there could have been such buddhist family lineages of tantic practitioner in India, but there is no record of them forming distinct institutions like the Ngakpa families of Tibet.

I am always happy to discover new historical information, but I have not seen any on this subject. what we call the tantric period in Indian history was pretty brief, chaotic, with lots of social upheaval. The insitutional base for Vajrayāna Buddhism was destroyed, and frankly, that last practitioners we know of date to the 17th century. Claims by 21st century Bengalis to 1000 year old tantric lineages ought to be met with some suspicion.  It is a little hard to suss out the Naths-- they might have maintained Cakrasamvara secretly, but there is only anecdotal evidence, nothing hard.

What was never the case was recognizing incarnations for the purpose of continuing lineages, which include property, and so on. And there are no accounts of Indians recognizing Indian children for the purpose of bequeathing lineages to them. We don't even find evidence of clans of mantrikas in India, as we do in Tibet.

No, you are wrong. People let chickens roam free in their yards. No one prosecutes them if those birds are taken by a hawk, etc., or wander into the road, and so on. You really don’t know what you are talking about. You are just having an emotional reaction. 

For example, if I had a cat (I own no pets), there is no law preventing me from allowing it out day or night without protection when ever I choose. As far as dogs go, the only laws restricting dogs are those which are in place to protect wildlife and livestock from dogs. Now, I agree if you deliberately staked an animal of any kind, domestic or wild, to be attacked by another animal, human or not, laws against cruelty would apply, but otherwise? No.

So, watching a bobcat kill a wild rabbit without interfering isn’t cruel, but watching it kill someone’s pet rabbit is cruel? The only difference is whether the rabbit is property or not. There is no inherent value that pets enjoy over wild animals. To insist that this is so is tantamount to claiming human values about the environment based on ownership and property rights is more important than every livings being’s right to survive. This is exactly the thinking that has led to the present environmental crisis.

In the definition of a truth, they place emphasis on the object, so for them, a relative truth is the object of non-veridical cognition. In general, they place emphasis on the object status, not on the whether the cognition itself is true or false. 

As far as "concealer" goes, it is a sort of bad etymology from the translation of vernacular texts into Sanskrit at an early period. In PalI:

Sammuti Sammuti (f.)

In terms of controlling the aristocracy, sure. The best thing one can say about the tulku system is that it provided a ready made elite from various walks of life. The family of a tulku, especially an important tulku, would immediately experience a rise in social elevation. But the system was and is corrupt. Tulkus also tend to be less well-educated than other kinds of lamas, because they are used more for their role in fund-raising, which means they have to spend more time doing rituals than studying dharma. Several of my teachers were tulkus. and they, generally, were universal in their observation that the tulku system was corrupt.
