RFK is not a credible person who can begin such a process. 

However, the first thing that needs to be done is to overturn Citizens United, outlaw PACs, etc., corporate lobbying, and so on.

I might be wrong, but i think Jules is implying two things: 1) Direct introductions work even if you imagine you didn't "get it" 2) If you truly believe you didn't get it, then you really didn't, and that practicing methods in such a deep state of doubt will be ineffective because one lacks faith in the process. This does happen, and it is either a sign of lack of faith or merit in the student. In this case, they should probably move on to a different teacher.

Thag gcig thog tu bcad pa. 

Interesting thing about this line is that it literally means "directly (thog tu) cutting (bcad pa) a single cord/rope/thread/line (thag gcig)."

When you are cutting a rope, you have to  decide to cut it, hence the connotation of "to decide" in Tibetan.

It's understandable, since the whole Burisma thing is a puton, found to be baseless by DOJ during the former adminstration:

Representative James R. Comer, the Kentucky Republican who is chairman of the Oversight Committee, made the announcement after summoning F.B.I. officials to Capitol Hill for a closed-door briefing on a document containing an unverified allegation of bribery against Mr. Biden when he was vice president. The Trump Justice Department investigated the allegation, which involved his son Hunter Biden’s dealings in Ukraine, in 2020, but prosecutors could not substantiate the claims, according to two people familiar with the matter...“What we’re talking about is secondhand hearsay,” Mr. Raskin said, adding, “That confidential human source said that he had no way of knowing about the underlying veracity of the things that he was being told...Representative Dan Goldman, Democrat of New York and a member of the Oversight Committee who examined allegations against Mr. Biden and Burisma as part of a House impeachment team in 2019, said the Republican narrative had fallen flat because Mr. Biden sought to crack down on corruption in Ukraine, not enable it.

“The facts are actually directly contrary to any of the Republican allegations,” Mr. Goldman said.”

Like any empowerment, active participation is required on the part of both teacher and student. So, no, one cannot give direct introduction to someone who is completely intoxicated. 

If one understands the meaning and symbolism of that syllable, yes, that's all one needs. The job of a teacher is to explain that meaning and symbolism to the student. 

Mind (sems) and pristine consciousness (ye shes),
are neither the same nor different.
They are phenomena that are difficult to differentiate.
The mind is the potential (rtsal) of pristine consciousness.
The basis of the mind is pristine consciousness.
Therefore, since mind and pristine consciousness
are both the same and different,
there is so-called liberation and nonliberation

All of my other points stand, unless you care to address them.

That's not actually true, theoretically or actually:

Here, however, the transformation from feudalism to capitalism took place under the control of an extremely powerful state, a different process from what happened in Europe and North America, where the role of the state was much less important and where countries were free of foreign interference.20 But this is a fundamental difference; and this difference in the role of the state explains why capitalism in China, Vietnam, and many other places, either in the past (South Korea) or currently (Ethiopia, Rwanda), has so often had an authoritarian edge to it.

The argument that communism was the system that enabled the transition from feudalism to indigenous capitalism in countries that were colonized or dominated by the West is also supported by the fact that communism was more successful in less-developed countries. When we measure the success of communism either by a crude growth rate or, preferably, by comparing the performance of communist countries against capitalist countries at the same level of development, we find a negative correlation between the income level of a country at the time when it became communist and its subsequent absolute growth rate, or its growth rate relative to its capitalist counterparts. In simple terms, this means that communism was least successful in developed industrial economies like East Germany and Czechoslovakia and most successful in poor agricultural societies like China and Vietnam.

Rig pa and mind are neither the same nor different. Even if you did not discover the “meaning wisdom” in a direct introduction, you still have the “example wisdom.” Of course a proper teacher is always communicating direct introduction from the perspective of the meaning wisdom, so anyone who participates has received all three transmissions-aural, symbolic, and direct-whether they recognized the direct transmission or not. This is also the principle of the fourth empowerment.
