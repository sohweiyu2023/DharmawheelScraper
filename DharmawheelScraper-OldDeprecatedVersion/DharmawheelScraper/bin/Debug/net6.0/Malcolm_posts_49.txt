If there are no aggregates in nirvana, how can there be an appearance of aggregates? It seems you are suggesting that in fact that the appearance of aggregates in nirvana are like the appearance of horns on a rabbit. In other words, these aggregates, which you now agree do not exist in nirvana, appear there due to a false imputation. Is this correct? But if this is so, you also agree that Buddhas make this false imputation, and as Candrakirti observes, they would not then transcend samsara because whoever makes false imputations cannot be considered a Buddha.

Is there a person in Nirvana? What kind of person? 

Aryadeva clearly states in 400 Verses:

[Since] there are no aggregates in nirvana, 
a person cannot possibly be [in nirvana]. 

Candrakirti comments on this:

If there are aggregates in nirvana, there is also a person. At that time, because they exist [i.e. aggregates and persons], in contradiction with sūtra there will be a support that turns into nirvana, and samsara cannot be transcended.

Who stated nirvana was peaceful abiding? Nirvana is peace, meaning a state free from arising or ceasing. 

The Mahāyāna analysis holds that as all phenomena never arose from the start, all phenomena have been in a state of nirvana from the start.

Nirvana cannot be oblivion, because "oblivion" means a state of annihilation [where it does not mean a state of unconsciousness]. 

Nirvana is cessation. Cessation is not annihilation, cessation is the absence of causes for further arising. 

For this reason, in Mahāyana, reality is described as non-arisen and unceasing. What has not arisen cannot cease, hence nirvana.

Sakya Pandita is more precise. To be considered a follower of Buddhadharma you must:

1. Accept the four seals*
2. Have gone for Refuge
3. Either be training in Buddhadharma through śila, samadhi and prajñā or have realized the fruit of the three trainings.

According to his thinking, if one satisfies all three criteria listed above, only then can one be considered a follower of Buddhadharma. Personally, I agree with him.

The old ontologiocal argument of St. Anselm:

Our understanding of God is a being than which no greater can be conceived.
The idea of God exists in the mind.
A being which exists both in the mind and in reality is greater than a being that exists only in the mind.
If God only exists in the mind, then we can conceive of a greater being—that which exists in reality.
We cannot be imagining something that is greater than God.
Therefore, God exists.

Recast:
Our understanding of the Real is a being than which no greater can be conceived.
The idea of the Real exists in the mind.
A being which exists both in the mind and in reality is greater than a being that exists only in the mind.
If the Real only exists in the mind, then we can conceive of a greater being—that which exists in reality.
We cannot be imagining something that is greater than the Real.
Therefore, the Real exists.

All these features are lacking in Sukhvati: there is no dissatisfaction at all in Sukhavati, hence the name Sukhavativyuha, the field of bliss/happiness, etc. 

Thus by your own analysis we cannot consider birth in Sukhavati a human birth place, not just because there is no womb birth in Sukhavati, according to its mythos, but because none of the feature you are defining as integral to human experience are present in that place. Hence the reason why birth in Sukhavati is a desiderata, according the Sukhavtivyuha sūtras. One wishes to be born there precisely because all the obstacles we experience as human beings are lacking there. In reality, Sukhavati is just a heaven -- no different than the heaven of Christians, Muslims, or Hindus. 

As I have mentioned elsewhere, there is good reason to suppose in fact that the blueprint for the concept of a Buddhist paradise arose in Central Asia (and not India) because of the Persian custom of building wall gardens, such as Cyrus the Great's walled garden at Pasargadae. The word "paradise" ultimately comes from the Avestan word "pairidaēza", which simple means walled garden where one can engage in peaceful pursuits. 


And therefore, the reason I stated that human birth depends on being born from a human womb, which seemed obvious to me at the time, and still seems obvious. There are also no women in Sukhavati, and certainly our gendered experience is crucial to being human as well.

Take a look at the "The Hardship and Downfall of Buddhism in India" showing that Indian Buddhism was destroyed by Hindus. This book convincingly puts to rest the idea that Buddhism was not destroyed by Hindus but rather by Muslims. It shows, convincingly in my mind, that the long standing and deeply entrenched Brahmanical hostility to Buddhism was in large part responsible for the downfall of Buddhism in India, as recorded in myths and accounts in Hindu texts and archaeology.

No. It's an inferential conclusion about a phenomena of which I have no direct knowledge (I have no recollection of past lives, and couldn't prove it to you even if I did).

As I said, they are fun stories, but in the end the real siddhis are the human qualities of compassion,love and awakening: in other words, the things that make us more human, not superhuman. Apart from the supreme siddhi, the other siddhis are just parlor tricks, even if they are true.

My basic point of course, is that I have seen numerous people injure themselves severely with prostrations (knees, backs, necks, wrists). As a Doctor, my motivation is to prevent further injuries so people can practice well and long. The Nalanda style of prostrations (so called half prostrations) is better than that Vikramashila style (so called full prostrations). It is easier on the back, knees and neck. 

Sun salutations is better than either in my opinion, because it works all the major joints and channels with little risk of injury done slowly and with care.

The fact that this school was  long lived is born out by the fact that  they were subject to polemical refutations from the time of Asoka until buddhism perished in India.

Bodhicitta is specifically the arousal [utpada] of the intent or mind [citta] to attain awakening [bodhi]. That has three forms: the intent to awaken as an arhat, as a pratyekabuddha, or as a Samyaksambuddha. 

The wish to awaken as a Samyak Sambuddha is special bodhicitta, the kind cultivated by bodhisattvas. 

Compassion is its condition. However, as Dharmakirti notes, love and compassion do not have the ability to cause one to achieve full awakening, i.e. the awakening of a Samyaksambuddha. One needs something more, and that something is Mahāyāna bodhicitta.

Yes, he is referring to the early non-theistic Saṃkhya of the Rishi Kapila, rather than the later theistic Saṃkhya. 

But this merely goes to show that it is difficult to define a universal core set of Buddhist doctrines that are uniquely and distinctly Buddhist. 

It is much easier to define what is not Buddhist than what is "Buddhist" in fact.

Universe created by God? Ok not Buddhist. And that's about it. 

Actually, if there is a teaching in Buddhism that is uniquely the Buddha's, it is dependent origination i.e. where this exists, that exists, where that arose, this arose; where that does not exist, this does not exist, with the ceasing of that, this ceased, etc. 

But not all "Buddhist" schools acccept this as the sine qua non of Dharma. For example, in Dzogchen, the twelve limbs are considered merely a gateway for deluded people, but not the sine qua non of Dharma.

What is interesting here is of course when seeking to find a common ground among Buddhist schools we depend on doctrines also found in Hindu schools such as Saṃkhya.

You can think what you like dear Magnus, but the man ngag de texts, all of them being termas, are all demonstrably later than the bodhicitta texts, with the rig pa rang shar and the sgra thal gyur being among the latest of all (no earlier than the 11th century).

Secondly, you are incorrect about "sems sde" trying to separate itself from Anuyoga and so on. Atiyoga, as Rongzom says, is "a commentary" of the lower yānas, as well as their definitive meaning.

But this is all besides the point.

What you call the view that Germano and I share is in fact the Western academic consensus, current even among Western academics who nevertheless are practitioners. 

So called sems sde and klong sde are contemporary, they are but two branches of the same teaching of the same Tibetan teacher, Vairocana -- there is nothing philosophically remarkable about klong sde that separates it from so called sems sde. In short, sems sde and klong sde are different streams of the same basic teaching. 

Man ngag sde however is a different matter. It is not a Tibetan "invention". That is too crude. It is a reworking of Dzogchen based on the second contact of Tibetan civilization with late Indian Vajrayāna. It is essentially gsar ma rDzogs chen.

The very meaning of "Buddhahood" has changed over time. 

++++++++

Basically, Buddhism and Buddhists are facing the crisis of modernity.

Like Christianity, Buddhism has no hope of relying upon the pre-modern myths and fables which provided its narratives. The vast majority of modern people simply will not accept the narratives traditional Buddhisms have proffered for explaining our world. Buddhism[s], which once provided a complete explanation of the universe, is/are no longer capable of doing so. 

Buddhism, like Christianity before it, will be forced to discover new meaning for itself, and will need to forge new narratives for itself, if it hopes to survive in the modern world. Of course Buddhism has the materials at hand to do so, like Christianity. 

In other words, the validity or absence of validity of Mahāyāna does not depend on its origen legend. If Mahāyāna depends on its origin legends for its validity, then it is intellectually moribund and philosophically meagre. If on the other hand Mahāyāna does not depend upon its origin legend for its validity, then it is intellectually vital and philosophically robust. The same observation can be made about those who require the origin legend of Mahāyāna to be literally true, they are neither intellectually vital nor philosophically robust because they are incapable of defending Mahāyāna ideas purely on their own terms without recourse to some imagined authority. 

The corollary however does not hold; the successful defense of Mahāyāna ideas on their own terms does not validate the legends of Mahāyāna origins. 

Again, this begs the question: just how many Mahāyānas are there? How many Vajrayānas are there? 

In short, Buddhism's "grace" period or probationary period in the West is over and done with. In order for Buddhism to hold its own in the free market of ideas, it must be able to do so without any recourse to traditional authority. If it fails at this, it will fail the test of modernity and as human civilization continues to advance and develop, Buddhism will become yet another footnote to history. 

In order to prevent that from happening, Buddhists must in fact be the harshest critics of Buddhism.

Yes, but it has strictly defined parameters. Despite all the deep learning, critical acumen, and doubt your Geshes may bring to the table, in the end, they are merely expected to master what is already accepted as true according to a consensus. Like musicians, they are merely expected to become expert at playing the scales. They neither expected nor encouraged to open up whole new fields of learning. They are expected merely to be vessels conveying the wisdom of one generation to another, unaltered like an impression from a seal. Now, do not think that in my view this has no value. It definitely has value. It is a part of human culture and learning. 

However, most of the classically educated Tibetans I know have a very hard time with the idea of evolution. They have difficulty accepting that modern humans come from Africa, and that all languages also originally come from Africa and that the pattern of human migration from Africa can be mathematically tracked. Indeed, they have difficulty with Science in general (all the while happily using the fruits of scientific endeavor in the form of electricity, cell phones, antibiotics, and so on). 

This is largely because up until recently most educated Tibetans are educated into a pre-modern view of the world that includes Mt. Meru, the Buddhist myth of the origin of humans in devas whose bodies gel and thicken due to their craving for the sweet "cream of the earth" (sa zhag) on the surface of the planet and so on. 

There is no fault in all this, of course, but it is important to remember that there are bound to be vast differences in the way persons like ourselves, raised and educated in a post-modern civilization will view the world when compared to those who have pre-modern educations. 

For example, a common theme among Tibetan teachers is the oft repeated trope: 

"...but the science of Buddhism will never change."
-- Dzongsar Khyentse
http://www.lifepositive.com/Spirit/Budd ... 112005.asp

"Why will Buddhism never change?", we ask; and answer as always is "Because Buddhism is based on wisdom." 

Of course, anyone who has studied history will instantly recognize this to be a statement that is at best, very naive. Buddhism has undergone constant change and evolution from the beginning. 

Even more questionable is the arrogation of Buddhism as a "science". It is not science, it never was and never will be. Buddhism, is, in its best aspect, a yogic tradition; at worst, a religious dogma. Buddhism may indeed have some ideas which are compatible with the worldview informed by modern science, but it equally entertains many beliefs which are not falsifiable in any respect, and hence must be considered non-scientific (which does not mean false, rather merely empirically untestable). 

Now, of course, Dzongsar Khyentse can be forgiven for referring to Buddhism as a "science" because of the use of the term adhyātmavidyā (nang rig) translated as so-called "inner science" where the term "science" is used to the translate the term "vidyā". 

We must however see statements like Dzongsar Khyentse's for what they are: reactionary rhetoric which misses the target. 

Modern science, as we know, is a method of coming up with predicative models. If one's predictions fail, one's model is defective, and one's hypothesis is either abandoned or revised by incorporating the results of one's failure. It is an iterative process, as we all know.

However, there is, in my estimation a religious and cultural insecurity which is responsible for sentiments like Dzongar Khyentse's, a sentiment right at home with similar sentiments about the Bible expressed by Christian Fundamentalists. It is an eternalization of tradition. Stating that Buddhism will never or has never changed is like asserting that words of the Bible or the Koran are infallible.

Woo-Chang, or Udyana. Monasteries, and Their Ways. Traces of Buddha.

After crossing the river, (the travellers) immediately came to the kingdom of Woo-chang, which is indeed (a part) of North India. The people all use the language of Central India, “Central India” being what we should call the “Middle Kingdom.” The food and clothes of the common people are the same as in that Central Kingdom. The Law of Buddha is very (flourishing in Woo-chang). They call the places where the monks stay (for a time) or reside permanently Sangharamas; and of these there are in all 500, the monks being all students of the hinayana. When stranger bhikshus arrive at one of them, their wants are supplied for three days, after which they are told to find a resting-place for themselves.

Again, while I do not happen to agree with it, the notion of natural right of ownership is, in European law since Locke, superseded by the principle that the right to a resource belongs to that person who can best utilize it. John Winthrop writes in 1629, an attitude in whole derived from Locke:

That which lies common, and has never been replenished or subdued, is free to any that possess and improve it; for God hath given to the sons of men a double right to the earth — there is a natural right and a civil right. The first right was natural when men held the earth in common, every man sowing and feeding where he pleased. Then as men and their cattle increased, they appropriated certain parcels of ground by enclosing and peculiar cultivation, and this in time got them a civil right — such is the right which Ephron the Hittite had in the field of Mackpelah, wherein Abraham could not bury a dead corpse without leave, though for the out parts of the country he dwelt upon them and took the fruit of them at his pleasure. The like did Jacob, who fed his cattle as boldly in Hamor's land (for he is said to be Lord of the country) and in other places where he came, as the native inhabitants themselves. And in those times and places, that men accounted nothing their own but that which they had appropriated by their own industry, appears plainly by this — that Abimileck's servants in their own country, when they oft contended with Isaac's servants about wells which they had dug, yet never strove for the land wherein they were. So like between Jacob and Laban, he would not take a goat of Laban's without special contract, but he makes no bargain with them for the land where they fed, and it is very probable that, had the land not been as free for Jacob as for Laban, that covetous wretch would have made his advantage of it, and would have upbraided Jacob with it as he did with his cattle. As for the natives in New England, they enclose no land, neither have they any settled habitation, nor any tame cattle to improve the land by, and so have no other but a natural right to those countries. So if we leave them sufficient for their own use, we may lawfully take the rest, there being more than enough for them and for us.

But we all know how this ended...

As I pointed out to you -- libraries pay a higher price for books in general than you do personally. 

Also, one can loan and borrow books on Amazon [for a yearly surcharge which is part of Amazon Prime -- clearly some portion of this is being paid to the publishers].

Authors benefit because they their books are being read (they are paid a higher royalty for library sales), Libraries benefit because they can purchase more books. Bookstores do not benefit from libraries of course, but that is the market for you. Libraries and bookstores are in competition which is why B&amp;N etc., permit you to browse and read books in their place, a deferred sales strategy, if you will.

All of this is off-topic however. 

In any case: it is clear that downloading software that has been broken into by defeating its cryptographic protections is theft. Those protections are placed on software sold to companies and individuals. You or the company is issued a license to use that software. If you break the encryption or give away the key to your unique copy of that software to others, you are guilty of theft. If you download pirated software, you are not guilty of stealing exactly, you are guilty of receiving stolen goods, technically. But receipt of stolen goods is still "taking what has not been given".

If I invent a car and patent it, then you copy it and then sell it, then you are stealing. 

I understand that in Canada, downloading pirated material is not illegal. But it is in the US. Hence, in the US, downloading music and software online is illegal, whereas if I make a cd of music I own and give it to someone, it is not illegal. Such is the nature of the contradictory laws. 

However, in general, since a piece of code is regarded as property, under US law, downloading pirated versions of Acrobat (where the software key has been compromised) is illegal. Giving away that key to others is also illegal, as you know. 

DMR also is used for the same reason. You have to break the DMR to pirate Itunes music. Of course, if you buy the CD, copy it and give those copies to your friends, this is not illegal. If you upload that copy to the internet, however, you will definitely be busted eventually if you do it a lot, and are a US citizen. 

But in general the second precept refers to taking what is not given. This also applies to a $50 bill lying on the ground. If you wish to be very diligent, it is better you do not pick it up. The same applies to digital media. As I said, there are certain Academic books that I will download from Scribd (some of which I have bought in the past for $$$) to further my research. But in general, I have a policy of not using that which I have not paid for, whether it is software, music, tv,  movies, etc. 

In the end it is a question of individual conscience as well as local laws. If I were Canadian, I would probably not be so reticent about downloading music and so on, since it is not illegal in Canada to do so. I would not download pirated software however, because that has be digitally broken into in order to be distributed.

There are the three main injuries that turn prostrations into a harmful and injurious activity as opposed to what they are supposed to be: a yoga for loosening the main channels of the body. These are: Injuries to the cervical spine, the lumbar spine, and the knees. 

To prevent injuries to the neck, lower your head as you bend down. 

To prevent injuries to the small of your back as well as your knees, you should never allow your knees to "hit", nor should you slide out from a kneeling position. You should slide out to the up position of a pushup, and then lower your body in such a way that you do not "hit" your knees (which causes many practitioners to have lifelong knee injuries) nor strain the small of your back. 

When you rise, keep your head down while you slide back onto your knees, and then when you stand, keep your head down until you are full standing, rolling up from the base of the spine. 

Despite the masochism with which many people approach prostrations, prostrations, and indeed no spiritual activity, should be a cause for harming the body, especially if you are a Vajrayāna practitioner, since knowingly harming the body is violation of root samayas.

The point is that the term "generation of [bodhi]citta" is what is usually translated by western translators as "generation of bodhicitta". For example, the Rangjung Yeshe dictionary gives:

sems bskyed - forming the resolve; motivation/ aspiration/ to resolve oneself; 1.Bodhichitta, producing the Bodhichitta, [bodhicittotpada]; 2) producing a thought; cultivation of an enlightened attitude. arousing / generating bodhichitta, mental disposition [when not particularly referring to the development of awakening mind]; aspiration; arousing / generating bodhichitta, cultivation of an enlightened attitude [ry]


 All three, arhats, pratyekabuddhas and buddhas arises from an intent to awaken [bodhicitta]. Much of Mahāyāna polemical discourse around this is to make sure that Bodhisattvas do not fall into the bodhicitta of an arhat or pratyekabuddha. All three attain bodhi, therefore, it is a misconception to say that those who aspire to arhatship and pratyekabuddhahood have no bodhicitta, but it must be recognized that these bodhicittas are considered inferior bodhicittas.

Second, you don't know that they are wrong, any more than atheists are not right in asserting there is no karma and rebirth. These are all abstractions, concepts. While I personally accept rebirth and karma, I am not going to insist it is true, other than to insist it is part of the Buddhas teachings and needs to respected as such. But there is no orthodoxy to defend in Dharma, because Dharma is based on personal experience and not on adherence to a set of views. There are many Buddhists who like the bulk of Buddha's ethical and meditative teachings, who nevertheless don't accept rebirth because they have no memories from their past lives and so on.

"The bodhisattva mahāsattva who wishes to overwhelm the cittopāda of the pratyekabuddha (who rejoices in patience) trains in the perfection of wisdom". 

The term "generation of bodhicitta" is a gloss for the term cittopāda, "generation of the intent". Intent for what? Intent for one of the three kinds of awakening, i.e., arhat, pratyekabuddha, or samyaksambuddha. 

There are many examples like this in the literature of the Abhisamayālaṃkāra which extensively discusses the differences in the creation of the various "intents" to awaken.

There is no one standard Sanskrit shape. For example, the syllables e vaṃ; most of the explanations of these two phonemes in the tantras involve their shape, shapes which they have in some Sanskrit syllabaries, but not all, and not in Tibetan. 

For example, the scripts used for the Nyingma tantras in Sanskrit in the 8th century could not be read by Indian Panditas in the 11th century. 

In the end the shape of the letter merely represents a sound...it is the sound that is important, not the shape of the phoneme.

Ignorance of your real nature. 

The body is not your self. 

Mind and mental factors are not your self. 

You have no self external to the mind and body. 

Your self is not the body and mind taken together. 

However, one designates the body and mind as a self based on convention, and that is fine. There is no other "self" than the conventional one designated on the complex of aggregates. 

It is true that some later Mahāyāna trends attempt to define suchness, or the real nature of phenomena as a "self" -- but these trends did not gain much currency in Indian Buddhism because the tortured rhetoric of "self" vs. "nonself" utilized by these trends merely serves to reinforce the concept that a self cannot be ascertained in one's five aggregates, separate from one's five aggregates or is all one's five agggregates together. 

Conventionally, there is no problem using the term self. The problem arises when one imputes permanent identity, i.e. an ultimate self, onto the continuum we are now referring to as "SittingSilent", etc.

You might read Hume's refutation of the self. It's sometimes helpful for those trying to grasp what the Buddha meant by absence of self:

According to the standard interpretation of Hume on personal identity, he was a bundle theorist, who held that the self is nothing but a bundle of experiences ("perceptions") linked by the relations of causation and resemblance; or, more accurately, that the empirically warranted idea of the self is just the idea of such a bundle. This view is forwarded by, for example, positivist interpreters, who saw Hume as suggesting that terms such as "self", "person", or "mind" referred to collections of "sense-contents".[58] A modern-day version of the bundle theory of the mind has been advanced by Derek Parfit in his Reasons and Persons (1986).

The term simply means when something lacks something, that lack is termed "emptiness". 

For example, the cullasunnata sutta, the lack of a city in a village is the designated as the emptiness of the village. 

In yogacara "emptiness" means the perfected nature, i.e., the absence of subject and object (the imagined nature) in the dependent nature. 

In madhyamaka, the absence of the four extremes in relative phenomena is ultimate, i.e. the emptiness of the things.

Worldly convention is predicated on cognitions of non-veridical objects, i.e. it is dependent on false cognitions. What does it matter if eyes and so on are products if the very substrate upon which the acceptance of their status as products is in itself delusion? 

Madhyamakas do not make propositions concerning existence. They accept whatever is in common discourse merely for the purpose of demonstrating (to those that care) that the terms of common discourse they are using are deluded and false. What is the root delusion? Assertions of existence which always involve notions of inherency. As much as Tsongkhapa wanted to sever the discussion of called "mere existence" or conventional existence from inherent or ultimate existence, in reality, one cannot hew the two apart. 

Nagarjuna's point, very simple put, is that when there are essences, only then can there be existences. When there are no essences, then there can be no existences. Such existences that are spoken about are understood to be merely conventional (meaning imputed, meaning not real), predicated on the deluded cognition of ordinary persons. These are accepted provisionally by Madhyamaka, but not asserted by Madhyamaka. 

The Gelug commitment to arguing essenceless existence is fruitless because there are is no such thing as an essenceless existence. This is why it is necessary to negate merely inherent existence, but rather one must negate all four extremes in both the relative and the ultimate -- only this is the profound emptiness taught in Mahāyāna.

The clause "therefore, since that is so...", only intends go affirm that sense organs and so on are products of the ripening of action, as previously stated, in conformity with worldly convention -- but it is not a statement of commitment on Candrakirit's part that worldly convention is truthful, which is why he remarks that one should not get involved with how it actually is. 

The translation (in this instance) is not successful and does not convey the meaning Candrakirti intends. Therefore, when you use it as a citation in support of a reason, the reason also fails. No, I did not have it lying around. Since the translation seemed a bit too pat to me, I examined the source of the citation and found it was slightly off when compared to the Tibetan. The term yod pa can be a translation of several different terms, ranging from asti to sat:

yod pa -  saṃ√vid:saṃvidyamāna
yod pa -  saṃniveśa
yod pa -  sat
yod pa -  sadbhāva
yod pa -  sāṃnidhya
yod pa -  a-vaikalya
yod pa -  /as:asti
yod pa -  astitā
yod pa -  /vid:vidyate
yod pa -  vidyamānatā
yod pa -  vidyamāna
yod pa -  upa√labh:upalabhyante
yod pa -  /bhū:bhavati

Since we do not have the sanskrit original of this commentary, it is a little hard to say what the proper rendering of yod pa is here in "de phyir, de yod pas", it could just as easily be "since that exists" as "since that is so". However, given that context, and given the fact that "de yod pas" bears the instrumental "s" on the yod pa, it is unlikely that to mean :"Therefore, they do exist", especially when there is no plural corresponding to "they" such as "de dag" (eṣām). 

An endemic problem in online discussions is the use of citations people haven't the skill to investigate themselves in either a Sanskrit original or in a secondary language such as Tibetan. In order to have a meaningful discussion, we must have first translations we actually agree upon. If we cannot achieve that much, it is difficult to have a meaningful exchange. This is also compounded with the fact that most of these discussions are not predicated on detailed discussions of the source texts, but rather post 12th century Tibetans involved in polemics with agendas often quite removed from the context in which these texts were composed. It is for this reason I generally abstain from discussions about Tibetan Madhyamaka any more, other than to observe that Tibetans after the 12th century, such as Dolbuba, Tsongkhapa, Gorampa (who in fact does not faithfully portray the early Sakya view) and so on began to introduce novelties to Madhyamaka discussion. Khenpo Zhenga tried to remedy this by restoring study of original commentaries and texts, but thus far western disciples of Tibetans still remain committed to whatever sectarian division they were initially trained in. 

On the other hand I am certainly happy to talk about Indian Madhyamaka as long as it is understood that citations from Tibetans are excluded from the discussion, since I decided long ago that Tibetan Madhyamaka was a waste of time.

So I can't accept your reason here because the citation is not correctly translated as far as I am concerned. Further, the point of the citation is not to prove existence of eyes and so forth, but rather in the original text, the point of the citation is demonstrate that:

དེའི་ཕྱིར་མཁས་པས་འཇིག་རྟེན་པའི་དོན་ལ་ཇི་སྐད་བཤད་པའི་རྣམ་པར་དཔྱད་པ་དེ་ཁོ་ན་ཉིད་མཐོང་བ་དང་རྗེས་སུ་མཐུན་པ་མ་བཅུག་པར་ལས་རྣམས་ཀྱི་རྣམ་པར་སྨིན་པ་བསམ་གྱིས་མི་ཁྱབ་པ་ཉིད་དུ་ཁས་བླངས

"Therefore, the wise who investigate according to how it is explained in the mundane meaning accept the inconceivable ripening of actions without getting correspondingly involved with seeing reality [de ko na nydi, tattvaṃ]."

There are different ways to read the hermeneutic of the three turnings. 
 
One has to present a logical reason why the so called third turning is superior to the second turning. Then one has to carefully identify which texts are actually referred to as such and so on. Personally, I don't think the three turnings are important. Why? Because this was just a scheme by one anonymous author to elevate his own text above other texts.

Further, the elaboration of a third wheel merely shows that texts like the Samdhi-nirmocana and the Nirvana sūtra are not part of the wave of original Mahāyāna texts, and belong to the second wave of Mahāyāna revelation.

In reality, the concept of the three turnings, which becomes so important in Chinese and Tibetan Buddhism receives almost no commentarial attention from Indians themselves in the Indian treatises.

Recall too, Atisha, while proclaiming Candrakirti's virtue, never had anything of his translated. Instead Atisha sponsored the translation of Pseudo-Bhavaviveka's Tarkajvala, etc.

Also keep in mind that "Candrakirti's" popularity most likely had more to do with the tantric Candrakirti's commentaries on the Pañcakrama than Madhyamaka.

Here, that which is being described as the nature of the mind, the mind essence, is what Mipham is describing. 

As far as Buddha qualities go -- it is appalling funny to see grown men arguing over whether the Buddha's penis withdrawn into a pouch ultimately exists.

I didn't say only, I said "can", it really depends on what you are defining as Dharmakāya -- and there are many ways to look at the issue. 

Madhyamakas have one approach; Yogacara's a different approach and so on.

Why don't you provide us with a definition for Dharmakāya and we can start from there?

How about the ārya-dharmasaṃgīti-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

"dharmakāya is the nirvana of the tathagatā". 

Or ārya-trikāya-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra

"dharmakāya means the absence of inherent existence like space"

Or the parinirvāṇasūtra:

"Without having exhausted afflictions, dharmakāya always exists"

These three statements for example can be seen as non-contradictory in the following way:

The Buddha realized nirvana; nirvana is the dharmakāya; dharmakāya is the absence of inherent existence, the absence of inherent existence, i.e. dharmakāya is a permanent fact of reality. 

Here, we have an example of asserting the dharmakāya as permanent without asserting that it is something which exists, like the Hindu notion of self. 

The problem as I see is that you take literally that which should be understood to be intentional or provisional.

Not at all. I merely stated that there are those who understand such statements to affirm some kind of transcendent existent absolute, and that those who have such an interpretation have not understood the Buddha's teachings correctly.

The passage you cite merely states there is a state of bondage and a state of liberation. It does not state that liberation exists without the context of bondage. In fact, it predicates liberation on the fact of bondage.

It really does not say anything more than nirvana means freedom from rebirth.

The only reason you are using a Pali canon citation is that you know that Mahāyāna sūtras are not defensible as historical records of the Buddha. 

Instead of giving citations, you should exercise your intellect, which is much better than becoming an expert in this or that species of dogmatics.

The interesting feature of Dzogchen is not the basis. The interesting feature of Dzogchen is its explanation of delusion. 

You can keep claiming potatoes are the basis I(no need to even call them "appearances of the basis) until the cows come home. This does not help one to understand the process of delusion at all. Fundamentally, Dzogchen teachings serve to explain the process of delusion and how to unravel it. 

I agree with you that the basis not improved by recognition or rendered defective by non-recognition. I also agree with you that delusion never stirs from the state of the basis itself. However, this does not mean that cognition of a potato is a cognition of the basis. It is a cognition of the all-basis. 

The cognition of conventional things is produced by consciousnesses impregnated with traces of delusion without beginning. The intellectual apprehension that delusion never stirs from the basis is still just an intellectual apprehension that does nothing in terms of unraveling the fundamental delusion the produces deluded experience in the first place. 

This is why for example, it is clearly stated in various places that gazing at rocks and trees for example will not lead one to experience the body of light because unlike the wisdom appearances of the four visions, the vision of rocks and trees are karmic visions supported on traces of affliction and action, i.e. the dualism of deluded vision itself. 

In order to see the basis as it is, rather than the deluded superimposition (samaropa) we normally perceive, we have to uproot the all-basis, the so called ālaya. 

Incidentally, in the account of the appearance of the basis it is pretty clearly stated that the appearance of the basis is perceived with sense organs that arise from the basis along with the neutral awareness that stirs from the potentiality [rtsal] of the basis. 

That primordial dualism [the connate ignorance, lhan cig skye ma rig pa] collapses when that neutral awareness recognizes the appearance of the basis as its own state; but when it does not, the imputing ignorance takes the name of the all-basis, producing all of our conventional, and therefore, innately deluded experience.

Snake [false appearance of the all-basis], rope [appearance of the basis]. 

On the other hand without the appearance of the basis there is also no basis for deluded appearances, so I can see why you are confused. This is the principle reason why the man ngag sde school elaborated a gzhi and a kun gzhi to account for how it is that deluded appearances are not the appearance of the basis (which cannot itself give rise to deluded appearances), while demonstrating that deluded, i.e., conventional, (i.e. the false) appearances of everyday things are rooted in the nonrecognition of the basis. 

In the bodhicitta texts no differentiation is made between gzhi and kun gzhi, since the concept of the appearance of the basis was not yet formulated. 

If potatoes are the appearance of the basis, there is no need for the elaboration of the all-basis to account for deluded appearances.

All kinds of things. Another thing I observed is that we in this culture, whether we were buddhists in pasts lives or not, have no tradition of punya-sambhara, merit accumulation, which is the rational which underlies 90 precedent of Buddhist ritual, irrespective of tradition. Because of this, we do not naturally reach for our wallets when we see monks and nuns. Instead, our model is a fee-for-service. 

As I have noted elsewhere, I don't see anytime soon that there is going to be much sustainability in Buddhist organizations in the West. 

For example, every school and every tradition and every sub-tradition wants it own space, etc. There is no sharing of space (because of course that requires also that people cooperate). One person shared with me their puzzlement at why one tulku wanted to place a center in a region where there was already a center that belonging to the same exact school and lineage. Or in Drikung, in Lincoln Vt., there are two Drikung Kagyu centers, and there used to be three (in a town of 1200 people). In Boston there were two. There is a huge impetus to build empires. 

You have to understand that the model of governance in Buddhism culture is grounded on the model of the cakravartin, the wheel turning emperor whose golden wheel [there are four grades of wheels actually] conquers any land it rolls through peacefully. Well, every Tibetan school turns its leaders into just such emperors, at least on a symbolic level, and this leads to lots of unnecessary competition and a lot of unsustainable development. It also, in the past, has lead to internecine warfare in Tibet. 

All of this is totally built into Tibetan culture at this point and as proof, we have the so-called "Kingdom of Shambhala" in Halifax, Nova Scotia, complete with a king and royal family, a court, an army and a grand narrative borrowed from the Kalacakra cycle. All of this, is deeply cultural. Of course we can make the observation that Karma Dorje does and assert that it is based on one's traces, and for us this is true. But it is not a sufficient explanation.

Depends. Recently I was chatting with a lama who was complaining that westerners never make offerings for prayers and so on, while the Chinese and so on do. 

He generally feels that it is because of a lack of faith on the part of Westerners. I responded that no, it is not due to a lack of faith, I pointed out that here especially in US where we have a strong tradition of separation of Church and State as well as strong Protestant traditions, that people tended to regard organized religion with suspicion, not because they have no faith, but because they regard organized religion as being corrupted by power and money. Also we have no cultural tradition of hiring priests to come and recite rituals, unless you are Catholic. Basically, what I was pointing out to him that most of this discomfort is grounded in sociological and historical reasons. I suspect that in Tibet, much of the competition revolved around getting people to recite your prayers, not the other guy's.

Every initiation has a refuge ceremony, as well as a bodhisattva vow ceremony built right into it. So it is completely unnecessary to insist that people take refuge and bodhisattva vows according to their respective systems of conferring vows. It simply isn't necessary. 

Their attitude come from the traditional Buddhist custom of "cutting the hair". For them, it marks one's serious commitment to the path -- this is why these kinds of traditional teachers are likely to insist that one has to have had a formal and separate refuge ceremony.

Average practitioners cannot tell if their teachers are realized. The average teacher generally is only interested in promoting their own teaching lineage. 

And what kinds of wrong conceptuality are we worried about here? Why the conservatism? Especially coming from someone who hardly fits a conventional definition of a Tibetan Buddhist since by your own admission you continue to practice Hinduism? 

In any event, I think it is important for people to study and receive a lot of things, rather than get stuck in these Tibetan lineage politics. Even if they spend some time in a state of confusion, life is short, teachings are rare, and deciding not to go to a teaching because "it might be bad for me" is really false thinking. If you are interested in tummo, go find a tummo teacher. If you are interested in Dzogchen, go find a Dzogchen teacher. 

Teachers really cannot discern your capacity unless they have known you for years. 

Of course, once you have perceived the essence of all teachings, then going to teachers is a waste of time unless you have a very specific reason for wanting this or that teaching.

Sure. Even Buddha had prejudices and biases. It's very obvious when you read the Pali canon, for example.

Buddha was a human being, he had a human brain, human sense organs and all the limitations of a human body (birth, aging, sickness and death). He was accused of sexual improprieties and all kinds of other faults. He watched his entire clan be murdered and enslaved and did nothing about it (if that does not demonstrate to one that Buddha found life empty of meaning, nothing else will). Rahula was hugely disappointed in him until Rahula decided to follow the Dharma himself.

Which century are you talking about? This is certainly not the case with writers like Davidson and so on. 

The notion of the evolution of Mahāyāna Buddhism and then Vajrayāna is based on text critical research. 

What is more amusing about your assertion is that classical Indian Buddhist historians of the eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh century take great pains explain why there is a sudden appearance Vajrayāna in India concocting all kinds of wild schemes from Vajrasattva in an iron tower in South India (Amoghavajra and Co in China) to the account of King Dza (Nyingma, but based on Indian antecedents) to the Sakya accounts found in 12th century Presentation of the General Divisions of Tantra, not to mention the earlier and well known account of the recovery of Prajñāpāramita from the Nāgā kingdom under the ocean by Nāgārjuna. 

You see, Indians themselves acknowledged from an early period in the common era that Mahāyāna also "suddenly appeared". 

Text critical scholars like Davidson, etc., are trying to work out the evolution of these texts because they were pointed to in that direction by what the texts and classical commentaries themselves reveal about the origins of these later canons. 

It is just too ungenerous to modern scholars like Gregory Schopen and so on to accuse them of some strange Christian biases. 

BTW, the first victim of Christian text critical scholarship was the bible itself. 

But text critical scholarship, while not the end all and be all of interpretation of what these texts mean, is very useful in understanding where these texts come from. But sadly, people conflate the two, assuming that if some scholar is correct about say, the Chinese origins of the Heart sutra (Nattier's theory), that therefore, somehow the Heart Sutra becomes less meaningful as a protective charm against non-humans. 

The problem is that Western people of a fundamentalist bent shy away from taking text critical scholarship seriously precisely because of our cultural tendency to interpret texts teleologically (which is a Christian, indeed a very western trait inherited from Plato, etc.), a tendency we have deeply inherited from the generally Hegelian theory of history (into which Tibetan narratives predicated on the role of the Imperial period personalities like Padmasambhava and so on play nicely) that we follow. 

So when we are confronted with early narratives like that in the 'Bum nag, the sBa bzhed, etc., where Padmasambhava has a human father and mother, we reject these in favor of wildly contradictory later accounts of Padmasamabhava's life story because our teachers don't like the idea that Padmasambhava had a human father and mother. 

In the end, there are certain Buddhist trends and narratives, especially in Vajrayāna, that play very nicely into our very Western habit of fundamentalism in thought and deed. 

This is ironic, because Mahāyāna teachings often completely deconstruct so called Hinayāna teachings, just as Vajrayāna deconstructs the Mahāyāna path and Dzogchen deconstructs Vajrayāna. 

We have all these Buddhist teachings deconstructing each other, and yet we have all these Buddhists, both Asian and Western, hell-bent on keeping the whole thing bound together with spit, twine and duct tape. Honestly, it is pretty funny to me.

He making a very specious cultural argument, when all is said and done. 

Frankly, I like Popper's idea about non-falsifiability. What DKR does not seem to understand is that non-falsifibility is a completely open-ended heuristic. It does not proclaim anything wrong. It merely addresses the limited range of what ordinary humans can see and creates a category of phenomena which are outside of the range of falsifiability.

Sorry, that is not where my path has lead me. It has lead me to unconditional confidence, knowledge and personal experience. I don't really respond well to the trust, faith and devotion thing. 

The Buddha taught that we suffer from birth, aging, sickness and death. He taught us how to escape that condition. Later humans elaborated on the Buddha's message and taught the deeper meaning underlying it (i.e. emptiness of inherent existence). Still other humans later on decided that was too extreme and decided that the deeper meaning needed to be augmented by a somewhat more positive message about our condition, and taught tathāgatagarbha. None of this however renders the universe meaningful. 

As I have said many times here and elsewhere. "Life has no meaning, but if you are a Dharma practitioner, then life is meaningful." But this is not a declaration of a teleological (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology) meaningfulness of the kind you are expressing here. It is also not a declaration of absolute meaningfulness. It is a strictly relative meaningfulness relevant only to humans who can think and judge. It is not a statement about the value of the universe or even the value of a spotted owl. Spotted owls are meaningful to me personally, but they are not ultimately meaningful in anyway. 

The universe will perish. Generally speaking we are taught in the Dharma not to impute meaning on the impermanent, the afflicted and identityless. Since even nirvana is identityless, it is a little risky for Dharma practitioners to invest much meaning in it. 

The absence of illness is health. 
The absence of suffering is bliss. 
The absence of meaning is freedom.

Yes, the Pali suttas are rather dry. One of the reasons is that they are NOT literary compositions. They reflect the extemporaneous speech of the Buddha. The themes covered are limited, oft repeated and formulaic. 

Let me give an example. You can listen to any DC webcast. I guarantee you that on the first day Norbu Rinpoche will say x, y and z. He often states these things in virtually identical phrases. The Pali canon is like that -- it is an oral record of what the historical Buddha actually said. 

Mahāyāna sutras are often quite interesting, because they are literary compositions intended for audiences with specific religious goals in mind. They sometimes emulate repetition, but they are not mnemonically repetitive in same way that Pali suttas are.  Thus, they should not be confused with what the historical Buddha said. 

The Mahāyāna Buddha is not a historical buddha by any accepted standard of historiography. Chogyal Namkhai Norbu writes on the birth date of sTon pa Shen rab: "...and since history must be studied in congruence with ordinary human perception, I prefer not to base myself on these traditions" (Drung, Deu and Bon, pg. 156). I suggest we should apply no less a rigorous standard to the study of all Buddhist texts and traditions than we do to the study of Bon and other religious traditions, and also judge them in concert with ordinary human perception. 

Whatever the Buddha of Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna may mean to us personally is not relevant to what we can know about Mahāyāna sūtras through careful text critical study and archaeological finds and it is better to keep the two separate. I understand that in some people this creates a cognitive dissonance, and they feel they have to choose one or the other. I don't have that problem -- who knows, maybe it is a result of practicing years of creation stage.

One does not cease to exist (ucchedavada); however with the absence of the cause for arising there is cessation. 

Life does not need to have any meaning for a bodhisattva (who understands the meaninglessness of life) to wish to free sentient beings from pointless rounds of samsaric existence. In fact it entirely underpins their whole motivation. They have recognized that there is no meaning to life, and they wish to rescue others from the delusion that life has meaning. 

The point of Buddhadharma is to cease having the experience of birth, aging, sickness and death. 

As Maitreya Bodhisattva is supposed to have said, there is not even the a needle point of happiness to be found samsara. Birth only occurs because of afflictions. When afflictions are eradicated, birth also ceases. 

However, the meaningless of life does not prevent me from enjoying life. I actually rather enjoy it more, since I know that my existence is free from the burden of teleological meaningfulness.

Yes, completely. The entire teaching of Buddha Dharma is based on the meaningless of samsara and ending the process of taking rebirth in it. Life = samsara. If samsara is meaningless, so is life.

Nevertheless, the primary goal of Buddhadharma is to achieve a nirvana in which nothing is left behind.

Yes, there is a difference between their qualities (wisdom being one of them), but not their liberation, i.e., freedom from rebirth in samsara, which after all is the definition of liberation by all Buddhist traditions, as well as a number of non-Buddhist ones.

You are confusing two different factors: Physical texts with age of a given tradition. 

The early Canon was largely oral. We know that by the time of Ashoka texts were starting to be written down. 

There is no record of an early reaction to Mahāyāna, as you would suppose there would be, since Ashoka purged the monastic sangha at the encouragement of the Vibhajyavadins. You see reactions towards proto Mahayāna ideas such as multiplicity of Buddhas and so on. But the first solid historical evidence we have of Mahāyāna texts is their translation into Chinese, and now a few fragments from Gandhara which support the idea that Mahāyāna was current in the Gandhara region during the first century. 

We have Buddhist texts written on Ashoka pillars that can be pinpointed and have been. We know that the Pali canon was written down in Shri Lanka during at the beginning of the first century BCE. We know that there were muliple canons. We also know that in Mahāyāna sūtras books are mentioned a lot. In the Pali sūtras, books are never mentioned even once. Clearly, the primary difference between the Nikāyas and the Mahāyāna canon is the difference between collection of texts that were recalled orally for centuries prior to being committed to writing to a collection of texts that are a product of a self-concious literary process of authorship.

Of course there is archeological evidence for it -- the evidence is in the texts themselves, all kinds of evidence -- from the naming of plants and trees, to locations, etc. 

The idea of the evolution of Buddhist spiritual practice in Indian history is based on very solid evidence, inscriptions, statues, etc. There is lot of plastic evidence that tracks to evolution of Mahāyāna into Vajrayāna for example aside from texts.

Irrespective of its historical origins: Mahāyāna is valid on its own terms or it is not. I accept that it is. Bodhicitta is a unique contribution of Mahāyāna to world spiritual traditions. I fully identify as a practitioner of Mahāyāna Dharma. I understand the desire and wish to trace this sūtra or that sūtra back to Shakyamuni Buddha, but I think it is futile.

The oldest known, physically surviving Buddhist texts exist on the Ashokan pillars. 

The Gandhari texts do not shown an overwhelming concern with Mahāyāna -- they reveal a few fragments of Mahāyāna texts dating to the 1st century CE, but we already know that Mahāyāna was in existence at this time due to the presence of 2nd century translations into Chinese. In order for me to be convinced that Mahāyāna was taught by anyone, let alone the Buddha, prior to the first century BCE, I would need to see some hard physical facts. Luckily for me, my soteriology does not depend on archaeology. Also my estimation of the capacity of Tibetans (or anyone else) to understand nonduality as presented in Buddhist texts does not depend on whether Buddha actually taught "nonduality".

It says nothing of their authorship. What the Buddha actually spoke is not really anybody guess, since there is sufficient evidence to prove that what is taught in the Pali canon/Agamas is more or less directly based on what the Buddha may have actually spoken. 

While it is certain that parts of these early teachings have certainly been renovated into sections of Mahāyāna sūtras, the real question is "Did Buddha actually, physically, as a historical reality, teach Mahāyāna sūtras." The answer must be, no he didn't, except in someone's pure vision.

I personally am rather tired of the cultural chauvinism exhibited by Tibetans. It is one thing to appreciative of one's culture. It is another thing to rest on the laurels of history (actually socio-geographical happenstance) and use this fact to tout the superiority of one's culture. 

I don't like it when American politicians waffle on about American "exceptionalism" and I don't like it when Tibetan teachers waffle on about Tibetan exceptionalism. There is nothing particularly exceptional about human beings in general, apart from our capacity to think and reason -- and even that is very questionable when viewed from a cosmic perspective.

This quote presents a false argument, one that is is very superficial. 

DKR goes from the premise that because Buddhologists in general do not accept the idea that Mahāyāna was historically taught by the Buddha (in other words, texts were composed that used the persona of the Buddha as a mouthpiece for various Mahāyāna doctrines) that they, indeed all Westerners, therefore are under suspicion of being incapable of understanding the nondual message taught in those texts. 

His argument is at base a species of cultural chauvinism. This cultural chauvinism that DKR frequently expresses in his lectures is distressingly blind. 

In sum, he starts with an issue of historiography and ends up leveling a charge of philosophical incompetence. DKR has a bad attitude about westerners. Its a pity really.

Vajrayāna was introduced to China primarily by a single master.

Vajrayāna was introduced some thirty years (or earlier) later into Tibet by a large number of masters. After all, Samye was completed by 779 at the latest on a Vajrayāna plan. This means that Padmasambhava was present in Tibet not later than 775. This is a mere 34 years after Amoghavajra returned from his travels in 746. 

When we examine these claims purely on the basis of historical dates, the claim that Vajrayāna in China is significantly "earlier" than Tibetan Imperial period Vajrayāna seems to be vastly overstated. Further, the unrestricted translation of so called anuttarayoga texts in Tibet was actually forbidden by royal edict and the main practices of the imperial period at Samye were grounded in Tattvasamgraha and the Vajrasikhara, just as in China and in Japan (from 804 onwards). Practices such as Vajrakilaya, which do date to that period, were very secret and not public at all.

In general, in many practices, the master of one's family meditated at the crown is one's guru, even in lower tantras. 

BTW, Jeff, you consistently say that Vajrayāna in China was "earlier" than that in Tibet. But this is not really true. 

Vajrayāna was brought to Tibet during the reign of khri srong lde'u btsan which lasted from 755 to 797 or 804 depending on whose account you follow. Amoghavajra only translated a portion of the Tattvasamgraha into Chinese in 754, thought he translated a number of other texts. Considering that it is very likely that the yoga tantra, etc., we see comes from South India by way of Java and so on, both by tradition and by textual evidence, and the so called annutaratyoga tantras such as Guhysamaja are sited in Oḍḍiyāna from the start, this accounts for the very different characters of Tibetan and Chinese Vajrayāna traditions, not "earlier" and "later" since Guhyasamaja and so on were certainly circulation by early 700's. Be that as it may, the main shrine in Samyas was devoted to the Vajradhātu Maṇḍala pointing to the presence of Tattvasamgraha by 790 at the latest in Tibet. sarvadurgatipariśodhanatejorājāyatathāgatasyārhatesamyaksambuddhasyakalpa-nāma, guhyasamaja, and so on are present in the ldan dkar catalogue pointing to its early presence in Tibet. Anyway, the Tattvasamgraha was never completely translated in Chinese until the 11th century, or perhaps the late tenth, around the same time it was translated into Tibetan.

That entirely depends on what you mean by "innovation". Guru Yoga certainly exists in a few Indian sources. For example, a general outline of Guru Yoga as it is universally practiced today is provided in the Hevajrasya hastavyavagrāhakrama-nāma. 

In general, Guru yoga is only an annutarayoga tantra practice. 

The practice of making use of historical or quasi historical figures for Guru yoga is a Tibetan innovation. It seems in India, gurus were generally imagined in the form of one's devatā.

When you have relinquished all traces for rebirth, automatically the twelve āyatanas will cease at the break up of the body. This is classic "hināyāna" nirvana. Peter Harvey's books suggests that after the eradication of affliction there is a tiny shred of evidence in the Nikayas that Buddha suggests that there is a which vinnana/vijñāna survives in a now unconditioned state (i.e. a state unconditioned by affliction) and that this is nirvana intended by the Buddha. He nevertheless insists that this continuum is not to be referred to as a self, and that Buddha would find it inappropriate to do so.

It depends on what you mean by nondual. There are three kinds of non dualism. One is cognitive non dualism, i.e., everything is consciousness, for, like example Yogacara. The second is ontological nondualism, i.e. everything is brahman, god, etc. The third is epistemic nondualism, i.e., being, non-being and so on cannot be found on analysis and therefore do not ultimately exist. 

The indivisibility of the conditioned and the unconditioned is based on the third. We have only experience of conditioned phenomena. Unconditioned phenomena like space are known purely through inference since they have no characteristics of their own to speak of. When we analyze phenomena, what do we discover? We discover suchness, an unconditioned state, the state free from extremes. That unconditioned state cannot be discovered apart from conditioned phenomena, therefore, we can say with confidence that the conditioned and the unconditioned are nondual. The trick is which version of nonduality you are invoking. This nonduality of the conditioned and unconditioned cannot apply to the first two nondualities for various reasons.

I don't represent a view or a tenet system. But when I examine what is stated in Buddhist texts, I do not see your view of them to be a very accurate picture.

For example, The Aryātajñāna-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra claims:
The mind is realized; since it is wisdom one should meditate on the idea of not seeking buddhahood elsewhere. 

The tenet system of you, Ardent, Vidyārāja, etc., is too seek a buddhahood that lies outside of the mind, the opposite of this.

Well, a major difference too was that in Tibet there was already a strong ritualist class that took to the imported Indian rituals like ducks to water. These ritualists performed vital economic functions in the Tibetan economy such as warding off rain, hail, ensuring harvests and calves, etc., exorcising spirits connected with contagious illnesses, herbalism and so on. On the other hand, Monastics in Tibet had little to offer the lay population, since their main function was conducting state rites just like the kind of early Vajrayāna we see about the same time in Japan and China. When the monastic establishment failed in Central Tibet in the 840's, during the Asian economic downturn of the late Tang, the Buddhist ritualists in Tibet continued to provide valued services to the local populations. It was only after the monastic establishment began to integrate these local services and allied themselves with the aristocratic families like the Khon during the 11th century and so on that the populace really began to lend wholesale support to monastic establishment.

I was not saying that shes rig becomes in the sense of arising. Merely that it becomes conditioned when it becomes involved in object imputation. The notion that shes rig is momentary depends on the conventional status of mind moments. Now granted, Sakya Pandita argues that timeless moments are immune to Madhyamaka reasonings, which according to him only apply to moments with temporal phases. This becomes very similar to the idea that shes rig is unconditioned because timeless moments would themselves be unconditioned with no possibility of any intervals between their instantiation. Of course we are then left with the quandary of what do to with timeless times. Sometimes in the Dzogchen texts you see reference to a fourth time, which is a state beyond the three times, past, present and future.

The nature of the conditioned is non-arising. Whatever does not arise is unconditioned. Non-arising, unconditioned, suchness, etc., are all synonyms. 

This is why Manjushri says "Whatever is dependently originated does not truly arise."

The core of the conditioned is unconditioned.

There are two ways this can be sliced: the first way, the Sakya approach, is to assert that knowing awareness (shes rig) is relative and momentary, its emptiness is ultimate, and that the two are inseparable. 

The second way to slice this is that time is predicated on objects (cf Vasubandhu) and that as objects are not established, time is not established (cf Nāgārjuna), leaving shes rig in an unconditioned state since it is not conditioned by objects (upon which imputations of time are dependent). In other words. shes rig is unconditioned and timeless because time and conditions are not established in any way, but the fact of knowing awareness is indisputable, becoming conditioned only when it becomes entangled in dualistic cognitions.

This is precisely the argument used in Tibetan history for the existence of sngags pas.When monks fled the chaos that ensued after Langdarma was assassinated for proposing to tax the monasteries, Buddhadharma primarily survived due to the interest of aristocratic Clans such as the Khon and so on in preserving Buddhist teachings within their families. 

After China's economy stabilized in the late tenth century, and trade between Tibet and China was no longer so disrupted, then the monastic community who had survived the travails of that epoch returned to Central Tibet and reestablished monasteries, encouraged by royal support. 

The other factor too is that in Tibet, sngags pas are not really considered "lay" in the sense understood here in the West. They have undergone a kind of ordination, They have vows that are distinct from monastic vows, they also have garb to wear, etc. They are educated, which sets them apart from the average person and so on.

Basically, the problem as I see it is that line of reasoning employed by Ardent (Koji), VidyArAja, and so on is that unconditioned and conditioned phenomena are mutually exclusive. 

For them the unconditioned is Self even if they cannot precisely say what that Self is (and they never seem to be able to). 

Vidyārāja sees this self as the one who is aware (since he keeps asking who or what is aware of emptiness) -- this is very similar to the Samkhya based metaphysics of all the Hindu systems. 

Ardent romantically sees the skandas as a mara (though how Ardent live with himself with such a negative view of his psychosomatic continuum is anyone's guess). 

In other words, their view is very Manichaen, since they are addicted to an absolute dichotomy between the conditioned and unconditioned or Gnostic, in the sense that the material universe is evil and they are seekers of metanoia so they may return to the pleroma.

What non-dual means in Buddhadharma is really quite different than what it means say to Sankara and even Gaudapada. Gaudapada may have been sympathetic towards Mahāyāna philosophy, and in the Agamasastra he indiscriminately cribbed yogacara and madhyamaka arguments to refute  Samkhya and Vaṣesika and so on. 

What nisprapañca means is also different in these systems. 

So, I don't really agree that all these systems are trying to get the same point, or have the same path, etc. As far as I can tell, Advaitans are climbing up one mountain, Buddhists are climbing a different mountain altogether. 

Apart from a common agreement that kleṣas are what is responsible for transmigration, I don't see these systems as having much in common in terms of how they present the basis, the path and the result. 

Also I really don't agree that brahman = śūnyatā.

It is not that it, like space, is without any of the qualities, powers, and aspects of a buddha, and it is not like the self of persons that the forders impute to be permanent." 
Mountain Doctrine, ppg. 118-119. 

But you, from the beginning of this discussion have asserted that the other emptiness asserted by Dolbupa is exactly the affirmation of the atman of the Vedantins and so on. 

This is why I say you have no idea what Dolbupa's actual perspective is.
