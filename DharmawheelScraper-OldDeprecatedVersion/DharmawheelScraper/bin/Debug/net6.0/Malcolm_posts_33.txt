To be a deep ecologist, one merely has to subscribe the eight-point platform. I don't recall seeing a requirement for belief in rebirth and karma included.

 	
The Deep Ecology Platform

1. The well-being and flourishing of human and nonhuman life on Earth have value in themselves (synonyms: inherent worth, intrinsic value, inherent value). These values are independent of the usefulness of the nonhuman world for human purposes.

2. Richness and diversity of life forms contribute to the realization of these values and are also values in themselves.

3. Humans have no right to reduce this richness and diversity except to satisfy vital needs.

4. Present human interference with the nonhuman world is excessive, and the situation is rapidly worsening.

5. The flourishing of human life and cultures is compatible with a substantial decrease of the human population. The flourishing of nonhuman life requires such a decrease.

6. Policies must therefore be changed. The changes in policies affect basic economic, technological, and ideological structures. The resulting state of affairs will be deeply different from the present.

7. The ideological change is mainly that of appreciating life quality (dwelling in situations of inherent worth) rather than adhering to an increasingly higher standard of living. There will be a profound awareness of the difference between big and great.

8. Those who subscribe to the foregoing points have an obligation directly or indirectly to participate in the attempt to implement the necessary changes.

—Arne Naess and George Sessions (1984)

They were a public reaction of Anglo guilt, signed into law by Johnson, at how poorly black people were treated. The guilt wore off. 

Then the usual racist and sexist recriminations began to be repeated again [even while social welfare programs for capitalists were expanded at an astonishing rate], and welfare programs, never more than a small fraction of the budget, were undermined and eliminated, especially under Clinton.

In other words, Republicans definitely believe in corporate welfare. They just don't believe in welfare for the poor, women, blacks and latinos.

You seem to have a very narrow definition of "movement." It seems that if there isn't destruction of property, violence and demonstrations, you don't consider it a "movement."

Deep ecology is first and foremost a personal discipline which informs how we relate to the world and its beings. Many people who have a deep ecological perspective are at the forefront of the ecological movement, including indigenous people and others who have never heard the term "deep ecology."

This part of the conversation began when I noted that the failure of the Green Party is rooted in two things: 1) it's abandonment of a deep ecological framework (at least this is clearly the case with the dominant Green Party in the US) and 2) its subsequent adoption of Ecosocialism, which is purely green-washed old school Marxism.

It means that all your success on the path comes from receiving teachings from the guru. Without a guru, no success on the path is possible. Why? Because in order to enter Vajrayāna, you must receive empowerments and so on. In recognition of the crucial importance of the guru, we have many supplications and visualizations where we receive blessings from them in the form of light. This is basically a symbol of receiving teachings. 

There is however no mystical force which transfers from guru to disciple called "blessings." It is not like grace.

The whole point is that the technology we use shapes how we perceive the world. To a hammer, for example, everything is a nail. Class is nothing more nor less than divisions of society based upon who has the privilege of extracting and consuming more resources. Class is a symptom of extractive economics, not the case of extractive economics. Therefore, thinking that we need to resolve class issues in order to resolved ecological issues is both far too human-centered, and is addressing a symptom instead of a cause. Indeed, the latter fact is largely the reason Socialist economies have been every bit as much extractive economies as Capitalist ones. As I pointed out already, Socialism never created a means of production on its own, and therefore it relies on the principles of extractive economics equally as much as Capitalism. 

Nope, the only way to resolve the ecological crisis is to abandon a human centered approach to civilization, and adopt a biocentric approach. As far as we know, this is the only planet that can support life such as ours. We better stop f&amp;8cking it up.

It is pretty simple, really ——&nbsp;I told you that the technology that got us to where we are today cannot fix these problems because our whole economy, as well as the technology it produced, is based on resource extraction and exploitation. Somehow, you reject this idea since you imagine, naively, that technology is value free, the old "people kill people, guns don't kill people" argument. 

The first step in solving a problem is recognizing it to begin with. I don't think you recognize the problem since you insist that the technology and economy upon which it is based is not the problem. For you, class is the problem. I don't agree with this assessment. Class is a product of the economy.

There was no state prior to the arising of samsara because samsara is beginningless. There is no "big bang" for samsara. The idea of a first big bang is not consistent with dependent origination, so it is either false or Buddha's teaching of dependent origination is false. The idea that the material universe contracts and expands without beginning however is perfectly consistent with dependent origination.

The Chandrakīriti citation I provided defines the two possibilities very well. It shows that one possibility, that of temporal first buddha, is impossible, while providing a usage for the term which is applicable to the dharmakāya. You further speculated about a pure mind that existed before samsara, and I rejected that possibility because ignorance is connate, arising together with the mind from the very beginning without being inherent to the mind in anyway. Even Samantabhadra had ignorance.

It is not a political position. It's a philosophical and ethical framework out of which decisions might be made. Since people seem never to read Naess, they never get what he is talking about. 

Deep ecology is a way of arriving at a system of values, which can then be expressed through political action. The expression of those values may be no different in expression than the way so called Social Ecologists express their convictions. For example, most Buddhists are, by and large, opposed to capital punishment for any reason; so are many Catholics. The framework through which they arrive at their shared opposition to capital punishment are utterly different, but in terms of the movement that they share, the outcome desired is mutual.

Well, lets look again at what the Sanskrit for that passage is:

emeva haṃ śārisutā maharṣī 

sattvāna trāṇaṃ ca pitā ca bhumi| 

putrāśca te prāṇina sarvi mahyaṃ


Śariputra, I, the great rishi,
am the protector (trāṇaṃ), the father (pitā) and the support (bhumi) for all sentient beings, 
all those creatures are my children. 

This shows a paternal relation, but it shows only that. And India, a guru was more important than your father, so the language of the father guru, the pitṛguru, is very common.

The prodigal son parable is very compelling, but it is not original.

Probably because Amitabha practice is a separate cycle, and not every center will focus on it. But for example, it is a very popular practice at KTD. And also, the longevity form of Amitabha, Amitayus, is also extremely popular, and many Tibetan Buddhists recite either one or both of these mantras daily. 

There is also the practice of the transference of consciousness, and in 90 percent of such practices, the goal of transference is Sukhavati, and Amitabha is the main object of visualization. 

So in fact, Amitabha is extremely important in all schools of Tibetan Buddhism, in one way or another.

Yes, that in fact is how Indians reading this text would understand it. Vasubandhu's commentary understands "father" (pitṛ) to mean teacher, thus it would read in his rendition, "I am the self-originated teacher (ācarya) of the world."

The Kalamas people were non-Buddhists, who by the end of the sūtra, convert to Buddhism. 

"Marvelous, venerable sir! Marvelous, venerable sir! As if, venerable sir, a person were to turn face upward what is upside down, or to uncover the concealed, or to point the way to one who is lost or to carry a lamp in the darkness, thinking, 'Those who have eyes will see visible objects,' so has the Dhamma been set forth in many ways by the Blessed One. We, venerable sir, go to the Blessed One for refuge, to the Dhamma for refuge, and to the Community of Bhikkhus for refuge. Venerable sir, may the Blessed One regard us as lay followers who have gone for refuge for life, from today."

Significantly, this sūtra merely shows a form of boosterism for the Buddha. It should be balanced with this from the Eastern Gatehouse Sutta:


"Excellent, Sariputta. Excellent. Those who have not known, seen, penetrated, realized, or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction in others that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed &amp; pursued, gains a footing in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation; whereas those who have known, seen, penetrated, realized, &amp; attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed &amp; pursued, gains a footing in the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal &amp; consummation."

You can describe it like that, sure. 

In Original Mind , MIpham makes this disctinction between the view of sūtra and the view of Anuyoga:


Furthermore, the Avatamska Sūtra asserts that the kāyas and pristine consciousnesses of buddhahood are impermanent by nature, but permanent by continuum. Those who assert the kāyas and pristine consciousnesses as the nature of the emptiness that possesses the supreme of all aspects are asserting that the kāyas and pristine consciousnesses are permanent by nature, and are asserting that they are impermanent by nature in the mode of appearing to trainees, according to what is taught in the Sūtra that Gathers All Intentions.

As such, from the perspective of the way reality is, while any phenomena included in the three times never moves from being the same by lacking birth and cessation in the natural state, since there is no need to reject or accept one side or the other of this duality arising distinctly as all phenomena there are such as self and other, samsara and nirvana, conditioned and unconditioned, past, present and future and so on, those in whom meaning of noncontradictory two truths that are equivalent with the teachings of the principles of realization endowed with eight profundities will easily give rise to the doubtless certain knowledge that is the intention of the sūtras and tantras of Mahāyāna. 

He mentions in another text:

In both the example luminosity and the vidyā of the Great Perfection, the reflection of the sky-like meaning luminosity is an appearance for the water-like mind. Though emptiness is ascertained by the mind (that meditates on emptiness) to be unconditioned, while the mind (in which that aspect arises) is unconditioned, a mind and an emptiness that are discrete will not appear in experience, but will be distinguished in the subsequent knowledge, just like the form of the sky in the water.

He lists six points of superiority:

1. The Great Perfection is superior through its preliminary practice.

2. It is superior through its ripening empowerments. 

3. It is superior through its physiology of nāḍīs, vāyus and bindus. 

4. It is superior through the great transference rainbow body of the fourth vision of thögal.

5. It is superior through its method.

6. It is superior through its explanation of the measurement of liberation.

Indeed, he finds evidence that Milarepa practiced the preliminaries of the Great Perfection (ever a subject of controversy) in a verse from one of Mila's songs:

I, MIlarepa, have gained prowess, 
prowess in the training in awakened mind.

Dudjom Rinpoche more or less cribs his arguments for the superiority of Dzogchen from this source.

The idea that there is a hard distinction between conditioned and unconditioned phenomena is a form of realism. The Dzogchen point of view is best, IMO:

No, this is the basis of stating that the supreme cessation is the non-abiding nirvana of buddhas and bodhisattvas. If the purified continuums of buddhas and bodhisattvas do not continue forever, it follows that they must somehow cease. If they must somehow cease, this is an annihilationist position. If you are argue it is merely a self within that continuum that does not cease because it does not exist, this still leaves us with the purified continuum of buddhas and bodhisattvas persisting forever since there is no condition by which such a continuum should cease given that there is no condition by which the continuums of sentient beings, the object of their compassion, will cease.

The latter leads to the former. The Mahāyāna point is that arhats, when they pass away, enter that equipoise and remain there, since we do not accept that there can be an absolute cessation of the mind. For example, on the next page, Asanga notes that the supreme state of nirodha is the nonabiding nirvana of the Buddhas and bodhisattvas which allows them to continue to benefit sentient beings.

Tantric empowerments only grant one a conceptual idea. They start with the idea that there  are aggregates which in fact need to be transformed into buddha families, for example, like applying an elixir to a base metal to transform it into gold. 

Dzogchen starts with the idea that there is nothing to transform, just something to point out. As Vimalamitra states in Buddhahood in this Life:

If it is objected, “If afflictions are liberated into dharmatā without antidotes, there is no need for purification on the path. Otherwise, liberation would require no effort,” for what reason would those who do not understand be liberated? Asserting that those who understand are liberated merely by recognizing concepts as dharmatā is the fruit of one’s wishes. As such, in order to recognize that concepts are dharmatā, the intimate instructions of the guru are important.

Supporting this perspective, the Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra states:

ecause it exists to be explained,
the result is attained through the explanation.
If not explained, how can there be liberation?
There are no signs in the dharmas of the basis,
no grasping to the dharmas of the path,
and no attainment of the dharmatā of the result.
The basis of sentient beings and the basis of buddhahood
is definitely differentiated by a sole difference.
For what reason is there a sole difference?
Why is it called “the sole difference?”
The basis of buddhahood is pristine consciousness;
the basis of sentient-beinghood is not pristine consciousness.
When both the pristine state (ye) and the consciousness (shes pa) of
it are combined,
it is the sublime transcendent state of the buddhas.
Therefore, what other differences are there?

Basis path and result has a different meaning in Dzogchen.

The basis here is not a cause, it is something one did not know. 

The path is recognizing what that basis is, based on the teacher's instructions which result in direct perception. 

The result is fully experiencing the qualities of that basis. 

Thus, Dzogchen is the result that does not arise from a cause. 

For example, let us imagine that we are living on an island of gold. But we have no idea what gold is, and so we make various discriminations between things on that island, liking this one, disliking that one, not recognizing their nature is the same. 

Someone explains to us what gold is, and then tells us to look past our conceptual discriminations to see what is actually there in our direct perception, i.e., gold. 

In the end, when we have ascertained that everything on the island is gold, then we have nothing left to do. 

This both what "the result that does not arise from a cause" means, and also what the basis, path and result are in Dzogchen.

Not so. When we say that "Arhats realize the selfless of the aggregates," in fact they do not realize the selflessness of the aggregates themselves, rather, only the selflessness of the person imputed on the aggregates. Gorampa points out:


Now then, if it is thought that one will be able to give up the grasping true existence of grasping the true existence in the aggregates with the unimpeded path of the śrāvakas, since apprehending the non-existence of true existence of the aggregates is not the main point, but apprehending the non-existence of the true existence of the person is the main point, there is no error. Likewise, since apprehending the non-existence of the true existence of the apprehended outer objects is the main point of the unimpeded path of the path of seeing of the pratyekabuddhas, it is possible to give up the grasping true existence of grasping the true existence in outer apprehended objects, but it is not possible to give up the knowledge obscuration beyond that. 

Because apprehending the freedom from proliferation of the four extremes with the unimpeded path of the path of seeing of Mahāyāna is the main point, that is the point of being able to give up all knowledge obscurations.

...

In brief, primary object of realization of śrāvakas is the selflessness of the person but that realization grasps true existence in the aggregates. It is necessary to reject [such grasping to true existence] because grasping true existence of grasping the true existence in the aggregates has the unimpeded power to cause the actual grasping to the self of persons. The primary object of realization of pratyekabuddhas is [42/b] the non-existence of true existence in apprehended outer objects. Because the primary object of realization of Mahāyāna is freedom from all proliferations of dualistic grasping, the difference in views are vast. 


---


In the context of the Abhisamayālaṃkāra, since the unshared path of the Mahāyāna is primarily explained, having considered that the realization of freedom from proliferation is the realization of the selflessness of phenomena, that is said not to exist for śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.

I only stated that where these three systems agreed was on one point. Where they part is based on their respective paths. For example, familiarity through 32 examples presented in the view of the inseparability of samsara and nirvana, i.e., resting in a moment of unfabricated consciousness (shes pa ma bcos pa), ordinary consciousness (tha mal gyi shes pa), or connate pristine consciousness (lhan gcig skye ye shes), is a necessary prerequisite in the system of Lamdre before one even embarks on creation and completion stage meditations.

Absence of attachment does indicate absence of cognitive obscuration. For example, one may have no attachment to chocolate, and nevertheless be ignorant of the flavor of coffee.

Gorampa disputes this point in his Differentiation of Views:

Moreover if it is inquired “If it is not possible to abandon the knowledge obscurations below the seventh stage, what object to give up would a śrāvaka Arhat entering the Mahāyāna path give up at the seventh stage?” It will be necessary to hide one’s head under a fur coat.

 
Some, wishing to avoid that error, claim “Śrāvaka Arhats enter from the eighth stage”, which is a truly inferior standpoint. If that were so, in order to accomplish Buddhahood from the very beginning it would be quicker to enter the śrāvaka path than the Mahāyāna path, since the latter must take wait two incalculable eons before attaining the eighth bodhisattva stage while the former can attain the state of an Arhat in three lifetimes through rapid effort, and afterwards it would then be sufficient to enter on the eighth stage. Also this appears to be a belittling affront to Mahāyāna

The reason why this debate exists in this tantra is because it reflects a debate on the ground in the 8th century between the Indian forbears of the Dzogchen tradition, Śṛī Siṃha et al and other Indians invested in the formal process of what we have come to refer, in blanket terms, as the stages of creation and completion. The passage itself favors those Indians who favored the formal process of the two stages. But the mere fact that the question exists in this tantra (which emerged following the era in which Śṛī Siṃha and co. lived) proves that this was a significant debate in Indian Vajrayāna circles as a relatively early time. 

But the creation and completion stages, as envisioned for example in the system of Sakya Lamdre or Naro Khachöma, is completely irrelevant to Dzogchen theory and practice. There is simply no need to go through the conceptual exercise of transforming one's aggregates, sense bases and elements in a mandala of deities, nor is there any need to work with karma vāyus, or relative nāḍis and bindus in the manner of the various completion stage systems such as those found in Lamdre, the Six Dharmas of Naropa, etc. 

It is for this reason that tantras like Hevajra are considered provisional in Dzogchen teachings. 

What in fact that Dzogchen tradition rejects is that the two stages are needed at all. They can be used if desired, but they are not necessary. Further, another consequence of this is that yogas derived from so called "completion stage" repertoire can be used without needing to engage in creation at all. 

There is simply no need at all, from a Dzogchen perspective, to engage in the conceptual exercise of substituting pure vision for impure vision when in fact the vision of pristine consciousness is constantly available to anyone to perceive at any time at all providing they have the proper instructions. If you want to learn what this means, find a real Dzogchen master.

Mipham explains it well, in his commentary on Mañjuśrimitra's Meditation of Awakened Mind:

If it is asked, “What is the method of realizing the definitive meaning through the indirect method?,” since nonactivity is illustrated with the activity of fabricated efforts, like pointing to the moon with the finger, also awakened mind correctly grasped through a symbol will accomplish awakening, because the Bhagavan Buddha, the teacher of devas and humans, has declared that it is “great awakening.” Any unfortunate one who conceptualizes entities should make efforts in the indirect method of realization. 


This unfortunate one is anyone who has not discovered vidyā, or has difficulty doing so. 

And:

If one meditates generating the thought that the samadhis and the mudras are dharmatā, and therefore are not different, the ultimate awakened mind arises from that. If one actualizes the meditation, one realizes that all phenomena do not exist apart from one’s mind. The accumulations are gathered and obscurations are purified because of that meditation. One becomes realized through one’s continuum being blessed by the deity of pristine consciousness.

He is not so confident about the identity of the named figures because he is not very familiar with the sNying ma tradition and its history. But I am quite certain that the reference refers to Śrī Siṃha. Moreover, there was push back by the anonymous author of the Hevajra Tantra who places this debate in the mouth of Vajragarbha:

Vajragarbha asked:

“This yoga of the completion stage,
its joy is called great bliss.
Completion is not a meditation,
so why do creation?”

The Bhgavan replied:

“Incredible, the great bodhisattva,
has lost the power of faith.
Where does bliss come from without the existence of the body?
Such bliss cannot be spoken of.
Joy pervades all migrating beings 
in the form of pervaded and pervader.

Just as the fragrance present in a flower,
cannot be known without the flower’s existence.
In the same way, since form and so on won’t exist,
also bliss itself won’t be perceived.

We cannot know what deed, small or large, that led to such a ripening. All we can know is that she experienced such a ripening. 

Karma does not make senseless violence sensible, nor injustice just. The operations of karma are beyond sense and justice. They are relentless. 

The ripening of karma is something which we all experience. For example, if could be the case that in the past, this person destroyed a spiders nest with juvenile spiders with some intense anger and hatred. What we consider small actions can have a very large result.

While I certainly applaud his openness in allowing specialists in non=Buddhist traditions teach in depth presentations of their tenets where Buddhists can listen to them, I think it is somewhat strange to make the unequivocal assertion that Trika (which has three different systems: kūla, spanda, and pratyabhijñā) and Vajrayāna are identical in meaning. And, I don't see any Bonpo teachers offering teachings there. Which is a bit strange because the first Khyentse was quite close to Bon. Bon and Vajrayāna are in fact identical in meaning. Bon needs more support that Trika.

No, the focus in Dzogchen is not on consciousness per se (the all-basis, the ālaya), it is on understanding the basis, which is inseparable emptiness and clarity.

Moreover, Trika is grounded in the modified Saṃkhya of the Shaiva tradition; whereas Dzogchen has its feet firmly planted in Abhidharma and Madhyamaka.

There is also an Advaita spin, based on Shankara's commentary. But the original Yoga Sūtras are fully Saṃkhya in nature and do not go beyond that view. During our yoga course, six weeks, Ramaswami taught on the Yoga Sūtras, and differentiated it's view from Advaita very clearly. Ramaswami is one of the last remaining direct pupil of Krishnamācarya, and the only person to whom the latter taught his entire system.

In the Yoga Sūtras, Iśvara is a special type of puruśa, a being who never experienced the tattvas. But Iśvara is not a godhead nor is it creative, per se. While it is indeed said that through devotion to Iśvara one can obtain mukti, mukti still means turning away from prakriti. Not only this, but in the Saṃkhya/Yoga view there are infinite puruśas, of which  Iśvara is but one. Thus did my teacher of Yoga, Ṥrivasta Ramaswami, teach.

The world's? Come on, be honest, DKR and put down your romanticism. Your Tibetan monasteries have been rife with materialism right from the beginning. Padmasambhava stated to Nyang Tingzin Zangpo:

Having assembled here, you all must listen well. The minds of all these Buddhists of Tibet, for the most part, have never been prepared. So in all of their religious activity thoughts of death and impermanence have not arisen in their minds. If it had arisen, this laziness and indolence would have never existed. They have never understand the characteristics of samsara. If they had understood, they never would have been attached to things. They have never contemplated the difficulty of obtaining leisure and wealth. If they had contemplated, these meaningful activities would have done at once. They have never understood this presentation of their minds. If they had understood it, they would have left non-virtue immediately. They have not seen the benefits and qualities of virtue. If they had seen it, distractions from gathering the two accumulations would have never occurred. They have never approached the profound path even a little. If they had approached it, they could not bear to be separate from meditation and practice. They have never approached the direction of the Mahāyāna bodhicitta. [3/a] If they had approached it, they would work on behalf of others without looking for their own advantage. They have no inclination for ultimate reality. If they had, this jealousy and pride would have never occurred. They have never heard nor contemplated the nine vehicles. If they had done so, they would understand the difference between higher and lower. They have never approached the direction of the view of secret mantra. If they had approach it, they would not accept and reject nirvana and samsara. They have never comprehended the view of reality. If they had, this ordinary grasping behavior would have never occurred. None of them ever desired to obtain complete buddhahood. If they had, they would have given up the activities of this life as unnecessary. Again, none of them have interest in Dharma apart from a few.

I am being totally fair. Materialism doesn't "grow" in the way he suggests. You think our civilization is more materialistic than ancient Rome? Ancient China? Ancient India? Ancient Tibet? Please. I do recall a famous king in India who slaughtered many hundreds of thousands of people, and then got religion because he felt bad about it.

It is not the case that you are not deserving. There is no such thing. It may be the case that you do not have access to a good teacher. 

You must remember that Buddhadharma is an oral tradition at heart. Without that oral lineage, you will not absorb the meaning of the teachings.

I completed a three year solitary retreat of mixed Sakya and Nyingma practices, between 1993 and 1997. 

I was given the title "Ācarya" (slob dpon) by Khenpo Migmar Tseten, Buddhist Chaplain of Harvard, Sakya, in 2004. 

I was encouraged to teach by the late Kunzang Dechen Lingpa in 2006, who confirmed my Ācarya title, and also conferred the formal Ngakpa ordination upon me. 

I was given the title of "Lama" by Lama Ngawang Tsultrim of Dongag Tharling in New Orleans, Nyingma, in 2008. 

I am a Doctor of Tibetan Medicine, having graduated from the Shang Shung Medical School in 2009. 

I have a forthcoming book, a translation of a seminal text in the Dzogchen tradition, available from Wisdom Pub., Dec. 6th, 2016. 

Any qualities I possess I derive from the kindness of my gurus.

The idea that an entity ceases is annihilationism. This is rejected by the Buddha. Cessation is simply the absence of causes for further arising. In this way there is cessation without any entity ceasing.

You don't understand. In Tibetan medicine, Rhinoceros horn is used in extreme small quantities, and from animals found deceased from natural causes. 

On the other hand, musk is also used. Bear bile is used. Ox bile is used. In traditional medicine, when such animals were not killed in large numbers for sport, their byproducts are important materia medica.

Well, there is the fact that no Bonpo texts were even written down until the early eleventh century, apart from some Dunhuang finds. And Dunhuang finds about Tonpa Shenrab just do not support the elaborate bios found in the Mdo 'dus, etc. 

I am happy to respect this and that narrative account as useful, inspirational chronicles, but we cannot confuse them with what we consider "history." History is secular, mundane, and injures Buddhist narratives just as much as it injures Bonpo ones.

No proper Saṃkhya or Advaitan would accept an ultimate buddhi/mahat. Buddhi, etc., is relative, and nonsentient. 

Purusha, on the other hand, is a passive, disengaged "enjoyer" which "lights up" the tattvas from buddhi down to the element of earth. 

When Purusha recognizes buddhi down to the element of earth as not being its own state, it takes the name Jñā, the knower. 

The difference between Saṃkhya and Advaita is the Saṃkhya recognizes infinite separate puruśas, whereas Advaita recognizes only one. In both cases, puruśa is eternal.

Sorry, but at minimum, someone who is teaching Dzogchen or Mahāmudra should at least have rudimentary grasp of Tibetan.
