No, it is not necessary to embrace the precise model presented in the Abhidharmasamuccaya to understand that the beings in the universe arises from causes of affliction and karma. One can understand the general principle to be correct without subscribing the particulars in every instance. And one can enter Buddhadharma without necessarily accepting any kind of belief, provided that one correctly understand that the Buddha's teaching is focused on ending rebirth in samsara, since that indeed is liberation.
