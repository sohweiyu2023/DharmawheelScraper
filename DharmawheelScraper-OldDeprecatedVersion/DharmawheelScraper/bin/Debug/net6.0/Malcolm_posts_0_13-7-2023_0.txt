Ok. This is a common view of Sakya and Nyingma prior to Sakya Pandita.

Longchenpa, and others, including ChNN, however assert that the view of Prasangika and Dzogchen are absolutely compatible, analytically speaking.

The point being made is that what Rongzom is criticizing is some Madhyamakas clinging to relative truth. He explains this at length in Intro to Mahāyāna systems.

She didn't, and when Rongzom was alive Candrakīrti was just being translated into Tibetan, and had yet to exercise the impact the latter had on Tibetan scholars. However, in the opinion of later Nyingma scholars, Rongzom would not have rejected Candrakīrti's madhyamaka. The Madhyamaka he was rejecting is very similar to Tsongkhapa's formulation.

"The Buddha" is a broad term. Not every Buddhist sūtra was spoken the Buddha, and the inner tantras are definitely not teachings of the historical Buddha, unlike the lower tantras. 

For example, Śākyamuni Buddha did not explain Guhyasamaja to Indrabhuti I. He merely manifested the mandala and bestowed the empowerment. The same goes for the Hevajra Tantra, although in this case some Indians held that he taught the Hevajra tantras while in the form of Hevajra, Of course, being in the form of Hevajra means one is not a nirmāṇakāya. 

And in point of fact, Sákyamuni never taught the Cakrsamvara tantra. It was taught by Buddha Vajradhara long before the time of Śākyamuni to Vajrasattva, thence to Vajrapani, who gave it to Saraha I. Likewise, the Dzogchen tantras were never taught by Śākyamuni, the latter merely predicted their arrival, etc. 

And all of these are "just so stories," without any historical fact to base them upon.  

So, we cannot be promiscuous with the notion, "Taught by the Buddha." One has to be precise. Not only this, but texts are not the real tantra anyway.

Anyway, I am sure you will be banned again for being a complete pain in the ass with your dogmatic obsessions, just like all the other times you chose to register under a new nym and start a fight with me.

Common mistake here: Samantabhadra also possessed the so-called ignorance of the same identical cause and the connate ignorance. 

The divide between samsara and nirvana happens with the third ignorance, the imputing ignorance. This is also the beginning of the delusion, the formation of the all-basis, the operation of the six intellects. This third ignorance, the cause of delusion is what Samantabhadra was never subjected to. This distinction is made because there is a) nonafflictive ignorance, which is a knowledge obscuration, and b) afflictive ignorance, which is the afflictive obscuration, and the actual start of the twelve nidanas. 

Thus, in every moment, we have the possibility to avoid the third ignorance, and realize the state of Samantanbhadra.

I had not thought of it that way, but I suppose you are right. If the aural lineage had been lost, no one could really have understood the tantras. The aural lineage history written by Longchenpa also shows there is no continuous lung for the text lineage. 

Also, the Zhang Zhung snyan rgyyud six lamps and the aural lineage preserved in the Yazhi are very close to each other in structure, they each present six bardos, six lamps, and so on.

The Seventeen Tantras are the heart of the Nying thig tradition. It's where the term "snying thig" comes from. However, there are two lineages: there is an aural lineage which went from Chetsun Senge Wangchuk down to Longchenpa, which is recorded in both the Lama Yangthig and the Zabmo Yangthig, which was based on a small manual written by Be Lodo Wangchuk of Nyantingzin Zangpos' instructions. Then there is the text lineage, which passed to Chegom Nagpo, then Tashi Dorje, then Nyma Bum. These two separate lineages were received by Kumaraja, who passed them on to Longchenpa. The latter wrote them down. 

Likewise, the Longchen Nyingthig Aural lineage was passed down to Patrul, who instructed Luntog Tenpey Nyima. He in turn instructed Khenpo Ngachung, who wrote it all down. It is preserved in Khenpo Ngachung's collected works in the sealed section. These two text are what is known as the "aural lineage" of Longchen Nyinthig. It is basically an explanation lineage for Yeshe Lama.

It is written down, in two texts called "snyan brgyud." These texts are commentaries on the respective trekcho and thogal sections of Yeshe Lama. The trekcho text is a synopsis of what Khenpo Ngachung himself explained. The latter was spoken to Khenpo Ngachung after Luntog Tenpey Nyima could no longer read well. So Luntog Tenpey Nyima explained from memory his understanding of the practice of thogal as explained in Yeshe Lama.

It's a heuristic. You don't accept rebirth, and that is perfectly fine. There isn't much point in trying to convince skeptics of anything. As the Throbbing Gristle song goes:

There's never a way,
And there's never a day,
To convince people.
You can play their game,
You can say their name, 
But won't convince people.

If you want to discover whether rebirth is a fact, you won't discover it through reason. You will only discover it through developing the necessary faculty of the divine eye in samādhi. But it is probably better for you to practice Dharma and eliminate your own afflictions. Even if you don't accept rebirth, you will be happier in this life.

He had some serious health issues which he tried to resolve through self-medicating, which led to his eventual death. I don't think your characterization of him as a "raging alcoholic" really assists anyone in understanding the man and his contribution to the Dharma, just as labeling Sogyal a sybaritic libertine does not really assist anyone in understanding the man and his contribution to the Dharma.

Whether we like it or not, liberation is clearly not a result of positive karma, and cannot be impeded by negative karma. If liberation could be impeded by negative karma, no one could ever attain liberation because we have gathered far more negative karma than positive karma from beginningless time. 

So we have this human life to get ourselves sorted out and that's it. We have a precious human birth. We should not waste it by perseverating on actions that have nothing do with us, spending our time accepting and rejecting.

Again with the Christian thing. 

Karma cannot be absolved. Buddha did not absolve Angulimala of killing hundreds of people. Karma either ripens or it does not. In Angulimala’s case, he was never going to take birth in samsara again. If he were, he would have necessarily experienced the ripening of those actions.

As for the bardo, if you don’t accept rebirth, it doesn’t matter. But if you don’t accept rebirth, karma doesn’t matter either. Also liberation does not matter.  And it’s strange you even consider yourself a Buddhist if you don’t accept rebirth, and so on.

I personally accept rebirth, based inference, etc. YMMV. Based on that acceptance, I take seriously the idea that most Dzogchen practitioners are liberated in the bardo and that everyone who enters the door of Dzogchen teachings attains liberation, again, YMMV.

As for crazy wisdom, I’ve explained what Trungpa meant by the term, before the tread got knocked off course by the usual handwringing and gnashing of teeth that results in some quarters from mentioning his name.

That’s hilarious. We are talking about someone who had the best Dzogchen teachers on the planet, who spent tons of time with all of them, who had total faith and devotion to Dzogchen teachings. Sure, Sogyal embarrassed himself, was sybaritic, pompous, and had many other apparent faults. That has nothing to do with his opportunity for liberation in the bardo, or his practice while he was alive. 

He also sponsored more teachers to come to the west than anyone else. I’d stack up that fact against his “ethical breaches” any day. He did more for the Dharma in Europe than you or I will ever do. The same goes for Trungpa. So stop being so arrogant and judgmental. 


If the Buddha were alive today, and some you heard that he had knocked up some women (as he in fact was accused of doing), I am quite sure some of you would believe it and abandon the Dharma.

But no, we are not pretending anything of the sort. I am pointing out that even heinous crimes, like those committed by Angulimala, are not a barrier to liberation. Since this is the case, why do you continue to rail against the notion that it possible for people like Sogyal to attain liberation in the bardo? In your moralistic world, only goody two shoes can be liberated. But this is a very Christian view, not the Buddha’s view at all.

Quite frankly, do you pretend to know what the actual effects of the actions of Trungpa or Sogyal are? From where I sit, it appears to me they introduced literally hundreds of thousands of people to the Dharma. 

More than that, are we really certain that in terms of karma, the “offenses” these teachers are supposed to have committed did not in fact remove many obstacles from the paths of their “victims,” shortening the paths of the latter by eons?

It’s quite narrow minded to pretend we have any real insight into the workings of positive and negative karma of this teacher and that teacher, this student and that student, given that the activity of karma spreads out over eons and countless lifetimes. We have all been every terrible being and benevolent being, perpetrator and victim alike. 

No one forces us to take teachings from anyone. But we should exercise caution before deciding to commit ourselves to a negative view of people like Trungpa and Sogyal.

That really depends on how one perceives dependent origination. When one understands the real meaning of arising from conditions, one understands nonarising. This is why it is said in the PP Sutra in 2000 lines, "Whatever arises in dependence, in reality, that does not arise."

Its also why Nāgārjuna states:

I pay homage to the best of teachers,
the perfect Buddha, by whom dependent origination—
neither ceasing nor arising, 
neither annihilated nor permanent,
neither going nor coming,
neither different nor identical—
was taught as peace to pacify proliferation.
