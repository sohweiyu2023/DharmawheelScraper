Just to add: the statement, "the buddhahood that does not come from mind" is specifically aimed at the yogacāra assertion that the dharmakāya is attained through the transformation of the basis, that is, the gradual emptying out of seeds in the all-basis consciousness, resulting in its destruction, and the subsequent conversion of aggregate of consciousness into the four gnoses: mirror-like, etc.

This point is addressed in topic 3 in Buddhahood in this Life, i.e. there is a conscious aspect of the basis which does not recognize its own state. This is explained in lesson 7 in my Wisdom Academy course, Dzogchen: Ten Key Terms, as well as I can explain it in one hour, plus there are readings from unpublished sources.

The explicit distinctions between the dharmakāya and all-basis are explained in Chapter Two of the Sound Tantra commentary, and also in the commentary of the Blazing Lamp.

From one point of view, all religious traditions are vehicles towards liberation, divided only by whether they are vehicles of samsara (the 360 wrong views) or nirvana (the nine yānas). 

It is also said that bodhisattvas like Avalokiteśvara manifest as any kind of nonbuddhist teacher, etc., to benefit those who do not have the merit to enter Buddhadharma:

The Bhagavān said to the bodhisattva mahāsattva Akṣayamati, “Noble one, there are world realms where the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the Dharma to beings in the form of buddhas. There are world realms where the bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the Dharma to beings in the form of bodhisattva mahāsattvas. The bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the Dharma to some beings in the form of a pratyeka­buddha, to some in the form of a śrāvaka, to some in the form of Brahmā, and to some in the form of Śakra. The bodhisattva mahāsattva Avalokiteśvara teaches the Dharma to some beings in the form of a gandharva. He teaches the Dharma in the form of a yakṣa to those beings who are to be guided by a yakṣa. He teaches the Dharma in the form of Īśvara to those beings who are to be guided by Īśvara. He teaches the Dharma in the form of Maheśvara to those beings who are to be guided by Maheśvara. He teaches the Dharma in the form of a cakravartin to those beings who are to be guided by a cakravartin. He teaches the Dharma in the form of piśāca to those beings who are to be guided by a piśāca. He teaches the Dharma in the form of Vaiśravaṇa to those beings who are to be guided by Vaiśravaṇa. He teaches the Dharma in the form of a general to those beings who are to be guided by a general. He teaches the Dharma in the form of a brahmin to those beings who are to be guided by a brahmin. He teaches the Dharma in the form of Vajrapāṇi to those beings who are to be guided by Vajrapāṇi

I have a lot of doubts about things people say about Zen teachings—in fact Jundo yelled at me last night for being biased(he's wrong, just for the record)—but I am too old now to switch directions (61), to scratch that itch, and find a teacher who I think can remove those doubts.

Yes, it is problematic to connect trekcho to Kagyu Mahāmudra in this way. 

You can discern why in Longchenpa commentary on the Treasury of Dharmadhātu, in chapter 10, where where he prefaces his presentataion of the method of equipoise in Dzogchen by the distinguishing between "meditation," which includes pretty everything in the nine yānas, as opposed to natural concentration, which he explains is the specific preserve of the Dzogchen tradition.

As for the third empowerment, there is no introduction in the third empowerment, just an experience, which serves the basis for explaining the example gnosis. Whether the fourth is the actual gnosis (path of seeing) or an example gnosis depends on the person.

This isn't really when one recognizes rig pa. Rig pa is the cognizant aspect of the basis , aka vidyā. 

This passage you refer to is talking about the visions, and when they are occur. But we don't need to practice the four visions in Dzogchen. 

In trekcho, there is no corresponding map to the paths and stages of lower yānas. Only in thogal. The first two visions are below the path of seeing, the third vision is the path of seeing, etc. In reaity, thogal is mainly practice to support one in the bardo of dharmatā.

Matylda’ s point, for quite some time and very consistently, has been that you won’t find genuine Soto merely by reading Dogen and practicing what one thinks he means by shikantaza. You will only find it by working with a realized teacher and that the transmission of realization in Soto has been lost in the past 100 years or so. 

She has asserted that there are no realized teachers of Soto Zen in Japan today that she knows of, that Soto has become lost in Dogen scholasticism and rhetorical posturing about practice = realization, etc. To the extent that Dogen scholasticism and rhetoric is reproduced amongst American exponents of Soto, one can infer she doesn’t think it’s likely there are any realized American Soto teachers either.

Title: Re: American Soto Zen
Content:
What I find most significant about this system of ecclesiastical grades is that dharma transmission provides access to only a relatively low grade. It is listed as a requirement for the very lowest ecclesiastical status, that of an instructor third class (santo kyoshi). Thus, in present day Soto Zen, dharma transmission constitutes a preliminary step, after which one’s real develop- ment begins. The relatively low status of dharma transmission means that in and of itself it does not qualify one to accept students or to train disciples. According to the regulations, Zen students should be supervised only by a teacher who has attained supervisory certification (i.e., sanzen dojo shike status), that is, someone who in the popular literature might be called a Zen master. To attain supervisory certification requires not just high ecclesiastical grades and dharma seniority but also at least three years’ experience as an assistant su- pervisor at a specially designated training hall (tokubetsu sodo), during which time one undergoes an apprenticeship. This monastic apprenticeship agrees with the popular image of Zen Buddhism as a form of extreme asceticism. The popular image, however, reflects only a limited view of Zen life. These training halls are found at only about one hundred of the nearly 14,000 temples that constitute the modern Soto school. The vast majority of Soto Zen religious activities occur not at the training halls but at the local temples.
Today, the key authority conferred by dharma transmission is that it qualifies a priest to manage an ordinary (jun hochi) local temple.

Bodiford, 

And:

While dharma transmission has never been restricted exclusively to clergy, it always has been controlled by ordained members of the clergy, that is, by people who receive rites of ordination, shave their heads, and wear Bud- dhist robes. Within this group, dharma transmission always has been a matter of insider knowledge, discussed only by the clerical elite, who themselves have been initiated into a dharma lineage. For ordinary lay people, in contrast, the much more obvious public social distinction bestowed by ordination always has been of prime importance, since it is the people with shaved heads and Buddhist robes who can generate karmic merit for the laity by accepting their gifts. At Zen Centers in North America, however, a lay-clerical distinction based on gift giving (by laity) and generating merit (by priests) is all but meaningless. Most people see Zen (especially sitting Zen or zazen) as a form of self-realization or relaxation exercises that lay people can practice as well as (or better than) clerics.43 Within this context, lay practitioners who might care nothing about priestly status can, nonetheless, become very concerned about dharma transmission, who has it and who does not. From conversations among practitioners at different Zen Centers, it seems each Center has developed its own individual culture of dharma transmission: here it might signify eligi- bility to join a Center’s board of directors, there it might mark completion of a koan curriculum, and somewhere else it might be seen as equivalent to clerical ordination, and so forth.
These variations in the social significance assigned to dharma transmis- sion highlight the unsettled state of North American Zen communities. Differences in their respective histories, founders, economic circumstances, and facilities have imbued each Zen Center with its own distinctive culture and idiosyncrasies. The Dharma Heritage Ceremony serves to remind Soto priests from these dissimilar Centers of the collective tradition they share. It provides a common ritual in which all of them can participate simultaneously, jointly offer homage to the founders of one another’s lineages, and formally acknowledge one another as religious peers.44 Clearly, it is designed to help foster the development of a new shared culture of dharma transmission. Each of the individual elements within the ceremony (the setting, musical instru- ments, processions, prostrations, circumambulations, prostrations, chants, and so forth) consist of standard Zen ritual practices as performed at Buddhist temples in Japan. The ceremony as a whole, its format and sequence as well as its emphasis on mutual affirmation, however, presents something new and uniquely American. Significantly, it concludes with all the participants chanting the Zen hymn known as the Harmony of Difference and Sameness, a title that aptly expresses the goal of the ceremony itself and the task now faced by the SZBA.45 Thus, the ceremony represents a development of traditional ritual forms for new purposes in a new land. It is a development that reflects both the growing maturity of Zen traditions in North America and their precarious, difficult quest to harmonize imported and native, old and new, similar and different.

Bodiford,

Just for context….

I think, if you read carefully, Matylda is saying that you won’t find what Dogen was talking about in any of Dogen’s writings, which according to her, have no bearing on the question of realization in the Soto School, as she understands it, since, as I understand what she is saying, what Dogen was talking about is only found in the interaction between teacher and student, and not in any books.

She has been quite adamant on the point that realization on Soto is dead. She has also suggested that Soto needs to be revived by a blood transfusion from Rinzai.

The situation in American Zen is even stranger, with whole lines of teachers and their students to whom they have conferred inka having conflicts with one another, or so I have heard.

No, I cited the half of the paragraph. I did not cut off any sentences. Here is another extract from the following paragraph:

The Zen school—members of the Rinzai, Sōtō, and Ōbaku lineages—is regarded as being foremost among them all. In recent times, however, the Zen schools have been engaging in the practice of “silent illumination,” doing nothing but sitting lifelessly like wooden blocks. What, aside from that, do you suppose they consider their most urgent concern? Well, they witter on about being “men of nobility” who have “nothing at all to do.” They proceed to live up to that self-proclaimed role. Consuming lots of good rice. Passing day after day in a state of seated sleep. The surplice and cotton robe they wear as Buddhist priests is no more than a disguise.

Ekaku, Hakuin. Wild Ivy (p. 2). Shambhala. Kindle Edition. 

Or how about these  paragraphs:

But for the past hundred years, ever since the passing of National Master Gudō,4 advocates of blind, withered-up, silent illumination Zen have appeared within the Rinzai, Sōtō, and Ōbaku schools. In spots all over the country, they band together, flicking their fingers contemptuously, pishing and pughing: “Great satori eighteen times! Small satoris beyond count! Pah! It’s ridiculous. If you’re enlightened, you’re enlightened. If you’re not, you’re not. For a human being, the severing of the life-root that frees you from the clutches of birth-and-death is the single great matter. How can you count the number of times it happens—as if it were a case of diarrhea! 

“Ta-hui made statements like that because he was ignorant of the supreme, sublime Zen that is to be found at the highest reaches of attainment. Supreme Zen, at the highest reaches, does not belong to a dimension that human understanding of any kind can grasp or perceive. It is a matter of simply being Buddhas the way we are right now—‘covered bowls of plain unvarnished wood.’ It is the state of great happiness and peace, the great liberation. Put a stop to all the chasing and hankering in your mind. Do not interfere or poke around after anything whatever. That mind-free state detached from all thought is the complete and ultimate attainment.” 

These people, true to their words, do not do a single thing. They engage in no act of religious practice; they don’t develop a shred of wisdom. They just waste their lives dozing idly away like comatose badgers, useless to their contemporaries while they live, completely forgotten after they die. They aren’t capable of leaving behind even a syllable of their own to repay the profound debt they owe to the Buddha patriarchs.

You've been around for about two years. Matylda has been around for two decades, beginning with E-Sangha. I am pretty sure she has more weight here than you do and has participated in many more constructive conversations than you. You have no idea what her intentions are, unless you are capable somehow of reading people's minds. So, you really ought to refrain from ad hominem statements.

Hakuin certainly had an opinion:

Anyone who would call himself a member of the Zen family must first of all achieve kenshō—realization of the Buddha’s Way. If a person who has not achieved kenshō says he is a follower of Zen, he is an outrageous fraud.

So, the concern isn't new.

Many thousands, actually.

I don’t think that someone should read this sutta and conclude that a woman cannot be a Buddha.

It is saying that a Buddha cannot have a female body, not that a women cannot eventually become a buddha, albeit, in a male body.

The problem with all of this, Matylda, indeed the whole discussion, is verification. How is a person who has never experienced kensho/satori, etc. able to ascertain someone who has and thus select them as a teacher? It is an act of faith, pure and simple. And that faith then turns into a confirmation bias.

Yes, completely. The tā particle makes all the difference. 

There are many "nondual" things described in Buddhist sūtras: for example the absence of the duality of existence and nonexistence, or subject and object, etc., or nondual behavior in the tantras, where one makes no distinctions between the food of outcastes and brahmins, for example. 

Nonduality however the idea that there is only one ontological state of sat, cit, ananda, being, consciousness, and bliss, characteristic of forms of Vedanta and so on.

You clearly have never been to the Bible Belt. 

https://creationmuseum.org/events/workshops/explore-jr/fossils/

Join us as we examine dating methods, fossils, and dinosaurs from a biblical worldview. The evidence from a biblical worldview clearly shows that the earth is young, and Noah’s global flood buried organisms creating the vast majority of fossils just a few thousand years ago.

Taking the talking rabbits in the Jatakas, and so on, literally, is about on the same level as this.

Śāriputra: Goddess, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?163
Goddess: Although I have sought my “female state” for these twelve years, [F.213.a] I have not yet found it. Reverend Śāriputra, if a magician were to incarnate a woman by magic, would you ask her, “What prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?”
6.­33
Śāriputra: No! Such a woman would not really exist, so what would there be to transform?
Goddess: Just so, reverend Śāriputra, all things do not really exist. Now, would you think, “What prevents one whose nature is that of a magical incarnation from transforming herself out of her female state?”
6.­34
Thereupon, the goddess employed her magical power to cause the elder Śāriputra to appear in her form and to cause herself to appear in his form. Then the goddess, transformed into Śāriputra, said to Śāriputra, transformed into a goddess, “Reverend Śāriputra, what prevents you from transforming yourself out of your female state?”
And Śāriputra, transformed into the goddess, replied, “I no longer appear in the form of a male! My body has changed into the body of a woman! I do not know what to transform!”
6.­35
The goddess continued, “If the elder could again change out of the female state, then all women could also change out of their female states. All women appear in the form of women in just the same way as the elder appears in the form of a woman. While they are not women in reality, they appear in the form of women. With this in mind, the Buddha said, ‘In all things, there is neither male nor female.’ ”
6.­36
Then, the goddess released her magical power and each returned to their ordinary form. She then said to him, “Reverend Śāriputra, what have you done with your female form?”
Śāriputra: I neither made it nor did I change it.
Goddess: Just so, all things are neither made nor changed, and that they are not made and not changed, that is the teaching of the Buddha.

They probably don't understand the Buddha's presentation of the three kinds of suffering: the suffering of suffering (intense painful experiences), the suffering of change, and the suffering of the compounded. 

If they understand these three kinds of suffering, then they might have a different answer. The only way to be free of the third kind of suffering is to put an end to rebirth.

Well, there is the Pali Canon, for one. Kapilavastu was probably a oligarchic republic, actually, not a absolute monarchy. 

You can look in the works of Bronkhorst on the social milieu of Magadha:

Aśvaghoṣa’s detailed description of the Buddha’s father as an ideal Brahmanical king contrasts sharply with other contemporary biographies of the Buddha. The Mahāvastu, for all its length, has very little to say about Śuddhodana’s accomplishments as a king. And the Lalitavistara presents him as an ideal Buddhist king, without using any Brahmanical terminology.41 Indeed, it would seem that Aśvaghoṣa has himself invented the elaborate descriptions of the ideal kingship of the Buddha’s father, perhaps with the conscious purpose of glorifying Brahmanical notions.
