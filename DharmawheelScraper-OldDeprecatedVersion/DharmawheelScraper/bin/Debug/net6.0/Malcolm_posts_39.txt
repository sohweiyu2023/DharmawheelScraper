What I said was that Rongzom maintains that if one has not understood the meaning of Dzogchen directly, one should meditate either sūtra or tantra style [without a bias towards either, incidentally], cultivating these five mental factors that constitute the first dhyan̄a, trying to maintain total attention [shes bzhin, saṃprajāna] within the horizon of complete mindfulness [dran pa, smṛtiḥ]. Thus, for many of us, developing this dhyāna is important to the degree that it assists us maintain the view. These two words, smṛtiḥ and saṃprajāna, incidentally, as the words ChNN is translating using "presence and awareness."

Samadhi is innate, it is part of the 10 neutral mental factors all sentient beings possess.

You will often find in the Dzogchen tradition the idea of self-arisen concentration —&nbsp;this is a result of recognizing the basis [aka rig pa] and stabilizing that recognition through various practices as Ivo mentions.

Right, the characteristic of space is its total absence, which is why the element of space is defined as "non-obstruction." It and the two kinds of cessation, are the only kinds of uncompounded phenomena [dharma, lit. bearer of characteristics] there are. Everything else is compounded or conditioned. 

When you begin to delve into higher Buddhist tenets, the metaphor of space becomes more important, since emptiness is linked to it. It is the basis and container of everything without being anything at all. Since it is the basis and container of everything, everything it supports isn't anything at all, like a magician's illusion.

Sort of, though that is not really what rig pa means. 

No one ever said it was the path of seeing. But paths and stages are completely irrelevant to Dzogchen. You do not need the kind of analysis advocated in sutra to realize buddhahood in the path of Dzogchen. It simple isn't a requisite. 

There are other practices that one does instead.

Introduction is a path. Once you have received introduction from a qualified person, then you apply it yourself. The only qualification one needs is interest. 

In Dzogchen, it is sufficient to have an inferential understanding of emptiness, for example, derived from the eight examples of illusion. 

The path itself does not necessarily involve any analytical vipaśyāna at all. It involves working with the experience of the introduction itself.

Dzogchen is not a path based on causes and results, as difficult as that is for many people to accept.

Patrul Rinpoche states:

First is the method of introducing the view that has not yet been revealed. Generally speaking, there are many ways of bringing the view to realization. In the sūtrayāna path of dialectics the method of lung rig [scripture and reasoning* MS] is employed; that is, using the scriptural authority of the teaching of Buddha and the great masters, and through logic and reasoning, arriving at the realization of the view.

According to the common approach of Secret Mantrayāna, by means of the wisdom of example in the third empowerment, one is introduced to the real, ultimate wisdom in the fourth empowerment. 

Here, according to the special approach of the great masters of the practice lineage, the nature of mind, the face of rigpa, is introduced in and upon the very dissolution of conceptual mind.

Neither of the two latter methods require analysis, as I said, "Anyway, such analysis is not necessary in Dzogchen practice, not in any sense at all."

The crucial point here is that rigpa, which abides as the ground of dharmakāya, is the primordial purity of the path of the yogins, the absolute view of freedom from all elaboration. Until you recognize this one point, then whatever meditation or practice you do, you can never get beyond a fabricated mind-made view and meditation. The difference between this and the approach of the natural Dzogpachenpo is greater than that between earth and sky, as it does not possess the essential point—the unceasing flow of clear light, which is non-meditation. So it is most important, first of all, to recognize this and this alone, and: “Recognize this as the pure awareness of dharmakāya”.

I don't know why you bother citing Patrul Rinpoche, as he merely illustrates my point.

No Astus, the passage you cite above, "If and when the mind is spontaneously engaging in meditative equipoise on suchness free of sinking and mental agitation, at that time it should be left naturally and the efforts relaxed." [pg. 139] Is followed in the text by:

"This is the path of engaging in a union of calm abiding meditation and insight. Its focuses on the image conceptually and non-conceptually." pg. 140. 

Thus, "This suchness is a generic image of suchness, it is not real suchness," as I said.

That is not merely what conventional means. For example, according to one famous presentation of Madhyamaka, things are not non-existent in the relative. The term vyavahāra has come to mean a mere designation in some Buddhist circles, but even here, there are levels of vyavahāra, holding that this or that is vyavahāra does not mean that one is not also a realist. For example, "water" is vyavahāra, but its qualities of limpidity and wetness are parāmartha dharmas according to Sautrantikas. For example, according to one famous presentation of Madhyamaka, we cannot say a car is nonexistent, even though it is conventional, we can only say that there is no inherent car in a car, not that there is no car in that which is conventionally termed "a car" because such a thing has been designated on the basis of its parts. Why? Because that which is conventionally designated a car functions as a car, and hence it is car. According to this specific brand of Madhyamaka, a car has a basis beyond its concept, its parts. One cannot designate a bunch of sticks and leaves a car and expect to drive anywhere.

The Kalamas sutta is addressing the Kalamas people, who were not Buddha's students. But in the end, they became Buddha's students. 

Once you become a student of the Buddha's, then:

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying in Savatthi, at the Eastern Gatehouse. There he addressed Ven. Shariputra: "Shariputra, do you take it on conviction that the faculty of conviction, when developed and pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal and consummation? Do you take it on conviction that the faculty of persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed and pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal and consummation?"

"Lord, it's not that I take it on conviction in the Blessed One that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed and pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal and consummation. Those who have not known, seen, penetrated, realized, or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction in others that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed and pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal and consummation; whereas those who have known, seen, penetrated, realized, and attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed and pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal and consummation. And as for me, I have known, seen, penetrated, realized, and attained it by means of discernment. I have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed and pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal and consummation."

"Excellent, Shariputra. Excellent. Those who have not known, seen, penetrated, realized, or attained it by means of discernment would have to take it on conviction in others that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed and pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal and consummation; whereas those who have known, seen, penetrated, realized, and attained it by means of discernment would have no doubt or uncertainty that the faculty of conviction... persistence... mindfulness... concentration... discernment, when developed and pursued, plunges into the Deathless, has the Deathless as its goal and consummation."

BTW, just because I think these books should be out there and available to the interested does not mean that I think such books should not also come with pretty stern statements about who such books are really intended for. 

We can create a culture of respect for the teachings without having to enforce restrictions on classic texts. 

For example, when the Bonpos published some instructions on Thogal, ChNN told everyone they should not read the thogal sections of that book. He did not say they should not buy it, etc. I think by and large everyone obeyed his request —&nbsp;I&nbsp;know I did.

I think it is much more strange that books on all the procedures of doing Kilaya practice are openly published for anyone to read, and no one says boo about those books, but when it comes to Dzogchen, everyone freaks out a little. And frankly, I think instructions on smad las rites should more restricted then any Dzogchen tantra, which is pretty vanilla by comparison [you won't find any smad las rites in any Dzogchen tantra].

The predictions in the sgra thal 'gyur tantra concerning the spread of Dzogchen teachings throughout this world indicate that it is the last teaching to remain in this world before the teachings completely disappear. It is similar to the principle that at first the hells disappear, and then each realm above it, until all that remains is the upper form realms. Likewise, in this world system, first the worldly systems will disappear, the lower yānas, than the outer tantras, than the two lower inner tantras, and in the end, the only teaching which will remain is the Dzogchen teaching. Of course, Dzogchen was also the first teaching ever to be taught in this eon. All teachings spread from there. 

So we should not be too worried about the teachings losing their power. Dzogchen is the essence of all of the teachings, it will never lose any of its power, ever, just like the sun and the moon will never lose their power to illuminate until this world system is destroyed completely.

My personal opinion from reading his papers and hearing him describe what he thinks Dzogchen means is that he has misunderstood key points, but I could say the same for a lot of faithful traditionalists as well. I also do not buy his speculative historical analysis of Dzogchen. But in this article I think Sangye is being a little over the top. Dzogchen teachings belong to humanity. And the cat is out of the bag anyway, so we might as well do our best to present the best possible translations available to the widest number of people so they can encounter the teachings. Frankly, invocations to Rahula are much more problematical as widely available texts than say the Rig pa rang shar tantra, IMO.

This is not the nature of the mind. The nature of the mind is not only emptiness. The result of this analysis epitomizes the fault the Kun byed rgyal po Tantra is pointing out to which exists in the sūtras of the bodhisattva pitika:

The sūtras of bodhisattvas...
assert dharmatā as empty space

No, you merely need look at the perceiver who uses the six sense media, and understand it is not established in any way, mere empty clarity. You do not need analysis, you need direct introduction through experiences. 

Since the kind of analysis used by Kamalashila and which are you now advocating involves coarse conceptuality, it is very difficult, virtually impossible through analysis to discover the nonconceptual empty clarity of the mind and go beyond mind. But when one works with direct introduction, it is very easy.

But this contradicts the Saddharma-pundarika sūtra:

And the Ārya-pitāputrasamāgamana-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

If it is asked "What is the samadhi that illuminates all phenomena?," here, for the purpose of engaging all phenomena, the bodhisattva mahāsattva does not mentally engage in any conceptuality or analysis 

It also contradicts the Ārya-tathāgatajñānamudrā-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

The consciousness without concepts about all phenomena is unobscured. 

And the Ārya-śūraṃgamasamādhi-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

Whoever does not conceptualize existence or nonexistence is free from the bonds of Māra.

I don't think it is contradicting sūtra at all. For example:

The Buddhāvataṃsaka-nāma-mahāvaipulya-sūtra:

The so-called "seeing" by which the mundane eye sees, 
the seeing lacking higher perception [vipaśyāna],
sees phenomena as evil.
If seen with higher perception [vipaśyāna],
nothing is seen. 

Or the Bodhisattva-pitika:

Again, so-called higher perception [vipaśyāna] is seeing just how all phenomena are; seeing the reality of all phenomena; seeing that non-otherness of all phenomena; seeing the emptiness, seeing the signlessness, seeing the lack of aspiration of all phenomenal. Again, so-called higher perception [vipaśyāna] is not seeing with a cause, not seeing with out a cause, not seeing birth, perishing or abiding, not seeing an objective cause — also the best seeing is not seeing at all. 

Or the Ārya-sāgara-nāgarāja-paripṛcchā-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

In the same way, there is the higher perception [vipaśyāna] that all phenomena are without cause, without persistence, isolated, totally unestablished. As such, whatever is seen, that is the vipaśyāna of all phenomena. Therefore, if there is higher perception [vipaśyāna] regarding all phenomena, when someone sees a phenomena, it is not higher perception [vipaśyāna]. If it is asked why, seeing phenomena is not higher perception [vipaśyāna] because a cognition is not cognizant.

Here, when we should understand that the term "mundane" eye refers to exactly the kind of mundane authorities Mañjuśrimitra is critiquing. 

It is this analysis with mundane authorities that goes exactly nowhere.

A perfect śamatha is nothing more than the first dhyāna, attended by five mental factors: vitarka, vicara, prithi, sukha and ekagraha. This is a universal definition. 

The idea that it takes a year to develop this experience is ridiculous. If you understand what you are doing, you can develop this experience in as little as a single afternoon. 

Since the mental factors of vitarka and vicara drop off above the first dhyāna, when one 's motivation is to engage in vipaśyāna, it is not appropriate to cultivate anything more than this.

Yes, because you are a materialist, and therefore reject rebirth, and consider the ripening of karma described by the Buddha as "supernaturalist." It's ok, I mean, I don't care whether you accept rebirth or not — but it is impossible to practice Buddhadharma correctly without accepting rebirth, you know, the "supernatural" kind, not the bullshit revisionism we see bandied about these days. At best, you might, as in the Kalamas sutta, be able to have a bit of relaxation by practicing the four brahmaviharas, but you certainly will not enjoy liberation.

What you fail to understand is that in Buddhadharma, matter is regarded as an emergent property of minds, not the other way around.

The point I am making is that intellectual analysis will only result in an intellectual apprehension of the object of analysis. Even when you are finished with the analysis, for example, the famous diamond sliver analysis, and so on, still in the end you are left with the concept "emptiness", "nonarising", "freedom from extremes" and so on, even though, as Mañjuśrimitra points out, since the conceptualized extreme does not exist, therefore the extreme to analyze does not exist. Therefore, conventional analysis by mundane minds cannot used in an ultimate analysis because they cannot escape their own conceptual clinging, indeed they are always with concepts.

Analysis merely substitutes one conceptual attachment for another, thus blocking the seeing of the truth; which one already sees anyway without knowing that one is seeing it. 

The question is really, "what does one hope to find in analysis?" Is there something to find? If there is nothing to find, than the analysis itself is a deviation from reality.

As chapter thirty-eight of the Kun byed rgyal po states:

The sūtras of bodhisattvas
assert the stage of Samantaprabhaḥ,
and assert dharmatā as empty space
through the investigation and analysis of the two truths. 
The great bliss of Ati Yoga
is awakened mind beyond investigation and analysis,
that which is beyond investigation and analysis is obscured by the sūtras. 
The Great Perfection explains that investigation and analysis
are error in the sūtras.

Yes, there is no special object to be apprehended. 

Your question was, "Is analysis necessary." In sūtra yes; in Varjayāna, no. As Vimalamitra states in his Buddhahood in This Life:

If it is objected, “If afflictions are liberated into dharmatā without antidotes, there is no need for purification on the path. Otherwise, liberation would require no effort,” for what reason would those who do not understand be liberated? Asserting that those who understand are liberated merely by recognizing concepts as dharmatā is the fruit of one’s wishes. As such, in order to recognize that concepts are dharmatā, the intimate instructions of the guru are important.

The face of prajñāpāramitā is not different than all appearances [this is fundamental tenet of Ati yoga, one of things that differentiates it from Chan/Zen, etc.], hence it is an object of mind, an experience.

This is because, as we know, that Indians were jealous and did not want to the Tibetans to receive the teachings. Therefore, to confuse the their diviners, in the earliest account we have [from the Bairo rgyud 'bum], Śrī Simha devised a ridiculous method of granting the teachings:

On the surface of three large boulders he placed an iron jar inside of a net. After the ācarya sat inside of it, he had the top filled with water and closed. Having run a clay pipe through a hole in the wall, those two monks where on the outside of the wall. As a precaution, they put their boots on backwards, they put long hoods on their heads, and listened. 

When the Indian King tried to find out who had given the teachings to the Tibetans:

Since it was asked which person bestowed them, also no one wished to reply, it was said “It is necessary to examine the mirror”. The mirror diviner said “The abbot who is explaining the Great Perfection, the Dharma of transcendent intimate instructions, is sitting on a rock, his body is filled with eyes. He is seated on the surface of three large rocks. A lake has arisen over his head. He is giving the explanation with a long beak. Two with long deerskin hoods are listening from outside.”

Since the Dharma protecting king and all the pandits said “This is incredible, are they emanations of an asura? They cannot be clearly identified from the mirror. It must be no other than the two Tibetans. It is clear from the water divination that a swift runner must be sent.”

This indicates that the Great Perfection was quite well known to the Indians at that time, not such a huge secret.

You need to read the entire teachings:

If you have attachment to this life, you are not a Dharma practitioner. 
If you have attachment to samsara, you do not have renunciation. 
If you have attachment to your own purpose, you do not have bodhicitta.
If you have grasping, you do not have the view.

This means if you are only working for this life's happiness and freedom from suffering, you are not a Dharma practitioner. If you are practicing Dharma for higher rebirth only, you do not have renunciation. If you are only interested in your own liberation, you do not have bodhicitta, the motivation to become Buddha for the benefit of everyone. If you have grasping [to the view of self, etc.], you do not have the view. 

The fact is that someone who does not accept rebirth automatically has wrong views and thus will not even be capable of stream entry. They will not understand why they are suffering and therefore, will not be capable of removing the cause of their suffering, just as a doctor who does not properly diagnose the cause of an illness will not be able to apply the proper treatment for that illness.

No, more or less it is the same thing. Absence of suffering is happiness —&nbsp;you may wish to contest this definition, but this is pretty much how happiness is defined by Buddhadharma. 

Eliminating suffering in this life is palliative, it does not address the root issue, the three afflictions that cause rebirth in the three realms along with their cause, self-grasping.

Not really.  As for on the record, well, it is all hearsay at this point. 

Now that ChNN has many students, well, Tibetans are hesitant to criticize success, but there is still of lot of discomfort with his approach. 

Basically, the difference between a real teacher of Dzogchen and someone who only teaches Dzogchen as a theory is that real teachers of Dzogchen teach Dzogchen as the basis. Others teach it as a result of a path, like Mahāmudra. In a real sense, when Dzogchen is taught as the apex of the nine yānas for example, this is merely to contrast Dzogchen with the eight vehicles of cause and result.

I read Crystal and the Way of Light when I was 25: it is amusing that I was really puzzled by the idea of self-liberation because I had been reading Mahāyāna, which I thought meant that one was to attain buddhahood for everyone. I thought it was a super interesting book though, but in the meantime somehow I was bullied into thinking I had to do ngondro and so on by the local Kagyus and Sakyas, so I started out in a traditional way. When I was 26, before meeting Sakya Trizin, I had a very interesting dream about ChNN. Still, I wound up in Sakya because I was interested in Hevajra. Then in 1992, I met ChNN.

All this is beside the point —&nbsp;but address your rebuttal — Chan/Zen do not offer some special model of liberation separate and unique. It is based on common Mahāyāna. Pure Land Buddhism may hold that one is liberated after one passes away from here in Sukhavati, but nevertheless that liberation is still a result of eradication of afflictions that cause rebirth in the three realms. And this is merely a variation on the never-returner. 

It may be the case that in the common Mahāyāna path one does not eradicate afflictions that cause rebirth in the desire realm until the eighth bhumi, nevertheless, this is because the bhumis of Mahāyāna stream entry are 1-6, once returner is the seventh bhumi, never-returner is eighth bhumi and so on. 

Still, the model is all based on the afflictive obscurations that cause rebirth in the three realms. Liberation is not omniscience. 

Stream entrants up to Arhats are all liberated, will never take rebirth in the three lowers realms, and their final liberation is guaranteed.

In the Hinayāna system, a stream entrant is guaranteed to reach the stage of an arhat within seven lifetimes. 

There is no such guarantee in Mahāyāna because the path is necessarily longer. It takes two incalculable eons to reach the eighth bhumi, and another incalculable eon to reach buddhahood after that. So, one does not necessarily progress beyond the level one reached in the past life, but eventually one will. Once one has reached the first bodhisattva stage, one no longer returns to samsara, so to speak, meaning that one's progress to buddhahood is a certainty.

The the question of the similarities and differences between Chan and Dzogchen arose because some early Tibetologists erroneously asserted that Dzogchen derived from what we call Early Northern Chan. 

There is a book by a 9th century Tibetan master, Nubchen Sangye Yeshe, which extensively examines the differences in the positions of Kamalashila and Hashang Mahāyāna, favors Hashang in terms of sūtrayāna presentations, but nevertheless asserts that Mahāyoga, even though gradual, is more efficacious than EN Chan because Mahāyoga has direct introduction, something lacking in EN Chan as it was practiced in 8th century in Tibet. Needless to say, it presents Atiyoga, Dzogchen as the pinnacle of vehicles. 

Chogyal Namkhai Norbu stresses that the Chan examined by Nubchen is not the same as Zen. He asserts that modern Zen has been deeply influenced by Esoteric Buddhism. 

The upshot is that when we have discussions of the relationship between Chan and Dzogchen, this has virtually no bearing on what people now a days practice as Zen, Chan or Son. For example, the Koan system did not even exist during this period of time, there was no Rinzai, no Soto, etc. The Chan under question is Early Northern Chan, and its sources and influence in Tibetan Buddhism all but ended in the 790's when the Tibetans chose Indian Buddhism as the gold standard.

By contrast the roots of Madhyamaka view and all Buddhist teaching in general is dependent origination. The Buddhist concept of nonarising found in the Prajñāpāramitā comes out of this insight.

This is why the Vimuktasena states that Prajñāpāramita teaches the emptiness of emptiness. For example, he says:

Since all phenomena are empty of emptiness, that is the emptiness of emptiness. In other words, the recognition that all phenomena are empty here is the emptiness of all phenomena. Further, the reason for the emptiness of that emptiness is to avoid conceptually grasping to it [emptiness].

Since everything is included in emptiness, emptiness is the ultimate, supreme truth.
The reason why one regards reality as different from oneself is that one has not known, through enquiry, the true nature of emptiness. 
As it is emptiness that appears as everything, those who have known the truth of emptiness have known the truth of everything.

What you desire is the opposite of your method. And in any case, this notion of "valid cognition of realized beings" is highly problematic. How does anyone know who is realized and who is not? This is why texts have words, and those words have invariable meanings. Even if you are not realized, as long as you understand and convey the the meaning, there is always a possibility someone can wake up from the meaning you have communicated as long as you have a valid lineage.

Alice was too much puzzled to say anything; so after a minute Humpty Dumpty began again. 'They've a temper, some of them — particularly verbs: they're the proudest — adjectives you can do anything with, but not verbs — however, I can manage the whole lot of them! Impenetrability! That's what I say!'

'Would you tell me please,' said Alice, 'what that means?'

'Now you talk like a reasonable child,' said Humpty Dumpty, looking very much pleased. 'I meant by "impenetrability" that we've had enough of that subject, and it would be just as well if you'd mention what you mean to do next, as I suppose you don't mean to stop here all the rest of your life.'

'That's a great deal to make one word mean,' Alice said in a thoughtful tone.

It really depends on which school you are interested in. Zen, Son and Theravadin schools [for different reasons] do not seem to have much problem accommodating theists. Most expressions of Tibetan Buddhism however would require you to take refuge in Buddha, Dharma and Sangha, and that means you would have to relinquish your former religious affiliations and beliefs. They would maintain one cannot find refuge in non-Buddhist deities if one has found refuge in the Buddha. So there is a difference in refuge. 

There is a difference of view —&nbsp;Buddhadharma utterly rejects the notion of an efficient creator god, or even a formal one. It instead proposes there is no absolute beginning, and relies in the notion of dependent origination and emptiness to explain everything. The Buddha maintained that views other than the view of dependent origination were false. 

There is a difference in path —&nbsp;since Buddhadharma rejects God in toto because of the view of dependent origination, liberation depends solely on one's own efforts and there is no external moral agency that one has to satisfy or worship. Liberation depends solely on recognizing one's own nature. There is nothing with which to unify, no transcendent principle binding all beings together, etc. 

There is a difference in conduct -- we will leave this aside for now. 

There is a difference in result —&nbsp;the result of practicing Buddhadharma is Buddhahood. Buddhahood cannot be attained in non-Buddhist paths.

If it can be experienced, it is relative. A relative mind cannot experience anything unconditioned. It is simply impossible. Also, in Buddhadharma there are only three unconditioned things, generally, space and the two kinds of cessation. [In Mahāyāna we add emptiness, but that is beyond discussion here]. 

Nirvana has two meanings but it is not an experience. It is a kind of knowledge that you will no longer take rebirth in samsara because you have exhausted afflictions, and second, when you die, your continuum ceases with regard to afflictive rebirth in the three realms. Beyond this, we move in the Mahāyāna Buddhology, which is a little more complex.

This is the suffering, this is the cause, this is its cessation, this is the path.

Of course followers of Buddharma are open minded. We understand that everyone is afflicted by the three poisons, since this is the direct cause of samsara and rebirth. We understand that every thing that everyone does, even if it is positive, even if we are followers of Buddhadharma, is tainted with the three poisons unless or until we cut the three poisons off at the root because we have woken up. And awakened people have nothing but compassion for everyone. However, as far as I know, there are no awakened people posting on this board.

The general motivation for all religions, even religions which advocate harming others, is to promote happiness and well-being. However, other religions arise out of ignorance of how things actually are and propose ineffective solutions for the problems they intend to address. 

We have to recognize that the beliefs and and practices of other religions do not lead to liberation, are at best palliatives for human problems, and at worst, cause rebirth in lower realms.

Definitely. 

Anyway, for example, we have the example of Muhammed —&nbsp;from whom did he receive the Koran? An entity called Gabriel, who presented himself as a conveyor of the word of God. How is this any different at all from Tibetan oracles, New Age channelers and so on? Nothing, in my view. 

We have constant information from the OT Prophets that they communicated directly with a being they gave various names, and they report this entity took and takes a generational interest in their people from a very early time. 

The "chosen people" meme has been one of the most destructive in human history because it gives a certain population a teleological claim to primacy and favor. The Israelites used it to wipe out enemy tribes, the Christians used to to forge their hegemony, causing massive genocides in the Americas, both north and south, the Muslims used it and are using it today, even the Communists used it with the myth of the proletariat [Communist eschatology is strictly Abrahamic in nature]. 

Monotheisms, as a class of religion, are entirely imperialistic in their ambitions, and this is one of the chief reasons I think they are all gyalpo driven, regardless of what individual Christians, Jews and Muslims [and Communists] may believe and whatever concept of God they may hold.

Religions do not form without cause. As far as I am concerned the actual "god" of the OT, NT and Koran is a rgyal po, more than one. rGyal pos delight on conflict and causing people to break samaya. 

And it seems to me that whatever adaptions of Greek Philosophy and so on Christians, Jews and Muslims may have made, again and again all three religions traditions become involved in paranoia, dominance and political power [the Jews, post Temple, much less so because of their long history of persecution, but these days, Israel?"]. For this reason I personally think that backbone of these traditions is sustained by a rgyal po/rgyal pos, and it can be more than one. 

You kept asking the question, are all these people rgyal po worshippers —&nbsp;of course not. I never said they were. If your philosophical definition of the divine is drawn from Aristotle or Plotinus, of course not. 

But it does not mean that you are not in the company of people whose concept of god feeds right into and feeds the egos of this kind of dregs pa. 

There can be many kinds of gdon associated with a religion. There gdon associated with the US Government, dkor bdags [owners of donations, literally] and so on. 

One reason why it is so hard for people to get off of the dole is that when one gets into debt with the government or the banks, and so on, the influence of the dkor bdags who rule your debt, Gvt. property and so on, keep you poor until you get free of the debt by paying it off.

Some people never get free, and this kind of provocation can be passed on in families for generations. This is why it best not to carry much debt. And if you have debt you cannot pay, it is better to declare bankruptcy. 

I am sure some of you reading this think I am insane, thinking "What? Spirits who have an interest in Bank and Welfar debt? What a crazy idea!" In reality, even secular institutions have their nonhuman protectors, whether they recognize them or not.

There are fifteen problems with this definition. So this is the definition of God, it is a nice tidy philosopher's definition and just as sterile. It is also perfectly Aristotelian in nature [as are similar Islamic definitions]:

[Et vita autem] And life also belongs to God; for the actuality of thought is life, and God is that actuality; and God’s self-dependent actuality is life most good and eternal. We say therefore that God is a living being, eternal, most good, so that life and duration continuous and eternal belong to God; for this is God.

Yes, the doctrine of the Rapture is a Scottish innovation. 

Theologians like Tillich were pretty clear that God existed, this is why he uses the term "ground of being" to describe God. A term, sadly, that has been misappropriated by some translators of Dzogchen texts [without any reasoned basis at all].

Specifically, I was talking about animal sacrifice and its negative consequences. Secondly, I voiced my opinion that the Abrahamic God bears the attributes of what we would call in Tibetan Buddhism, a rgyal po, keeping in mind that in reality such entities are in fact formless pretas. 



It is very clear in the OT and the Koran that this god demands blood sacrifices. So they are offered up. 

We generally accept that the pantheon of Hindu devas are real, albeit worldly entities. For example, Shiva, often portrayed as a transcendent deva in Hindu sources, is a worldly protector in Buddhist sources. 

I take Orishas seriously because I have relatives from Haiti, and their experience with Voudou practitioners, and because of my experience with the Sangoma I mentioned and my experienced in SA in general. 

I take Japanese Kami seriously, because I have been in Japan. 

I take the whole range of provocation illness [gdon nad] quite seriously because I work in Tibetan Medicine. Not only that, one of my main gurus was the chief exorcist/weather controller for the Tibetan Gvt. 

So, I don't think that religions form around nonentities, apart from the Flying Spaghetti Monster:



Since by definition, outside Dharma, there are no transcendent religions, I think the world is a place where there are a lot of deep forces of a nonhuman variety shaping human actions on many levels. This is pretty standard point of view for a Tibetan Dharma Practitioner.

I understood perfectly well. Being born in a country where there is no Buddhadharma, or being born without interest in Buddhadharma means that one does not have a precious human birth. Such people are objects of compassion because who knows when they will be free from samsara.

Pointing out that the deities of other religions are samsaric is not disparaging them. It is stating simply that those paths do not lead to nirvana [cessation of afflictions]. They have a different goal in mind, if they even have a goal [there are plenty of religious expressions, such as Purva Mimamsa, that do not even believe in the concept of liberation, mukti.]

People who are not fortunate, those who have not met the teachings, are objects of compassion. This does not prevent us, however, from analyzing and understanding their mistakes and how the views they espouse shroud them in darkness. 

For example, the Rig pa rang shar tantra runs through 60 incorrect views. The Brahmajala sutta runs through a different set of 62 incorrect views. 

The point is not to castigate people who follow those views, the point is to understand that those views exist and that they are not conducive to liberation.

It is very simple.

There are basically two paths: samsaric and nirvanic. 

Samsaric paths have a number different kinds of paths: eternalist, annihilationist, incorrect conduct [like impaling yourself with weapons], wrong paths and so on. 

Nirvanic paths refer to the nine yānas beginning with the śravakayāna. 

When I say worldly, I mean samsaric.

Gyalpos infect our minds and encourage people to break commitments and to lust for power. Devas possess humans and cause them to start cults, the list goes on and on.

There are three kinds of religious paths: Saddharma, Lokadharma and Mithyadharma. Buddha's Dharma is Saddharma. Everything else is either a Lokadharma or a Mithyadharma, and is usually a mixture of both. 

For example, you might ask, well, what about Jesus? Jesus was a human being, a man. He was not a spirit, or some kind of provocation. But in reality, it is exactly the kind of death he suffered that gives rise to Gyalpos. Gyalpos arise when people with powerful spiritual charisma, etc. are murdered. 

The Christian pantheon is filled with martyrs who also can have exactly that kind of rebirth, as powerful avenging spirits. Then there are more benevolent protectors, we like to call them "saints." 

Gyalpos, etc. function best when they are not recognized as such.

Since no one believes in them any more, very little is done to quell their actions, and as a result we live in the kind of world we do.

There are some people, for example, who think that a certain Tibetan Gyalpo is a Buddha. They do not, as far as I know, engage in any kind of animal sacrifice. But they are still venerate a gyalpo as an awakened being. Are you going to defend them on the principle that what their texts say may not be representative of the finest exponents of their tradition?

This is a straw man. First of all, the Meru cosmology is fundamentally a moral cosmology. Second, it is not the only cosmology in Buddhist texts, merely the most referenced because of its axial nature.

As you are probably aware, E. Henning disputes the notion for example, that the authors of the Kalacakra root tantra could have believed in a flat earth cosmology, because their calculations alone contradict this notion —&nbsp;thus the modified Meru cosmology found in the Kalacakra is there for symbolic purposes, but is not taken literally. 

The Meru cosmology presents an Indo-centric view of the ancient world, embellished with Indian aesthetics. While some, like Vasubandhu, may have taken it literally, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that not everyone in ancient India did.

Buddhist laity in the 4th -- 1st century BCE? Why would they? 

We know quite well that Buddhist monks are forbidden from engaging in prognostic disciplines (which are not confined to astrology), but for what reason can we believe that the laity would refrain from their exercise? Doesn't make sense. 

The problem with your text critical approach is that it ignores subaltern culture and tradition. It is myopic in so far that it declares that, without a contemporary artifact, third country report and so on, this or that thing did not happen. It is an approach very much in line with logical positivism, which is why I constantly criticize it as materialist. This is why I criticized Daverupa's approach to the Pali canon. 

For example, the problem we have in studying pre-Buddhist Tibet is that the reliable textual record can go no further back than 7th century CE, based on criteria with your methodology will accept.

Our attempts to understand the pre-7th century culture of Tibet and Zhang Zhung can only be mined from Bon and Buddhist sources that are quite late, and pretty much everyone agrees that we can only make broad conjectures based on systematic themes found [mainly] in Bon literature [which is very understudied and poorly understood in the West] which clearly differentiates native Tibetan cultural patterns and practices from imported Indian, as well as Chinese, patterns. 

But if we accept your methodology, we can say nothing of this culture prior to its being noticed by Tang Chinese bureaucrats and Arab generals. But obviously there was a culture there, and a people, and so on.

You are suffering from a misconception about the relationship between texts and Dzogchen. Vairocana writes in The Final Utterly Secret Unsurpassed Mind Tantra of Vairocana:

The Pellucid Transcendent State of Samantabhadra asserts that buddhahood cannot be obtained through gathering accumulations and purifying obscurations caused by samsaric impediments. 

If one wishes to attain buddhahood, three recognitions are necessary. Those are: the result does not arise from a cause, buddhahood does not arise from the mind and the intimate instruction does not arise from scripture. 

Furthermore, all buddhas do not attain buddhahood gradually, but attain buddhahood instantly. If recognized in the morning, there is buddhahood in the morning. If recognized in the evening, there is buddhahood in the evening. Vajrasattva said:

Buddhahood is not attained through purification [sangs].
Through recognizing the three kinds of self-origination,
pristine consciousness expands [rgyas] from vidyā.
Manifest Buddhahood is in three instants.

This ignores that in practice that Mahāyāna practitioners in India often memorized large portions of Mahāyāna sutra.

Eventually his translation was superseded, but for a least half a century it was the main text Tibetans used. 

People are too quick to dismiss memorization and oral transmission in the presence of writing. Writing in India was used to support oral transmission, not supplant it.

Even if you do not have total realization in this life, you can still manifest what is called rainbow body, where your body shrinks and disappears in seven days. 

Śakyamuni Buddha demonstrated control over the elements many times, for example, levitating to the height of 14 palm trees. If we assume an average height of 30 feet, this is roughly 500 feet in the air, roughly the equivalent of a 50 story building.

The very short explanation is, according to the upadesha class tantras such as the root tantra of Dzogchen, sgra thal gyur, that there is a neutral awareness [shes pa] that arises out of the basis because of a stirring of vāyu [rlung], sometimes mistranslated as prāṇa (prāṇa is a vāyu). Because there is a movement, accompanied by sound [sgra], lights ['od] and rays [zer]*, there are appearances that arise out of the basis. When these appearances are recognized as one's own state, this recognition is what is called "rig pa", it is also given the name "shes rab" or prājña. When these appearances are not recognized as one's own state, this is called "ma rig pa", avidyā.

It is for this reason, for example, that the famous Aspiration of Buddha Samantabhadra begins:

All of the universe and beings, samsara and nirvana
have one basis. The two paths and two results
are the enchantments of knowledge [rig pa] and ignorance [ma rig pa].

The two paths are the path to buddhahood, which is based on rig pa; and the path of the six realms which is based on ma rig pa. 

Futher, we can see that vidyā, rig pa comes from the basis, but it is not the basis:

Vidyā self-originates from that basis itself
without bearing the faults of external and internal reification,
free from the tainted darkness of amnesia,
therefore, it self-appears unaffected by faults. 


Rig pa self originates from the basis because rig pa is just the recognition of the basis as one's own state itself. It self-originates because you did not receive this knowledge from someone else, you must recognize it in a direct perception called the direct perception of dharmatā, your real nature. The so-called "direct introduction" is mere a method to introduce you to "your own face." This is one reason why the metaphor of the mirror is so important in Dzogchen teachings. This rig pa, this true knowledge of one's own state, is therefore unaffected by subject and object dualism; is free from non-recollection, because once you have this unmistaken knowledge, i.e., vidyā, you will never forget it, and therefore, vidyā is unaffected by any faults whatsoever.

However western translators may translate these terms, what they mean in Tibetan is very precise, and between Chos and Bon, have exactly the same meaning. 

You can see again in this following passage that shes pa, awareness, and knowledge, rig pa, vidyā, are used in two different ways:

One’s vidyā [rig pa, knowledge of the basis] abides in a pristine state,
not terrified by the terrors of the three realms,
not attached to sensuous qualities. 
Physical form and color do not exist
in self-originated nonconceptual awareness [shes pa].

One's vidya, rigpa, knowledge, abides in a pristine state because there are no physical forms and colors in consciousness; rig pa is the knowledge that the appearances of the five lights and so on in one's fundamental unfabricated consciousness are not substantial or real. They are merely the energy of the basis, from which that awareness is inseparable. 

When this knowledge does not arise, then as the Aspiration of Samantbhadra states:

First, since vidyā/rig pa did not arise in the basis 
deluded sentient beings
cannot recall anything and are confused.
The cause of that is the delusion of ignorance.
Within that is a sudden unconsciousness
in which a fearful awareness stirs without clarity, 
Within that self and other are perceived as enemies. 
From the gradual buildup of traces, 
entry into the process of samsara happens. 


If vidyā is the basis, then there is no way anyone could ever be deluded, samsara would never have happened. Indeed, there is popular strand of misconception in Dzogchen that claims that samsara never did happen. While this is true from the point of view of Samantabhadra [and hence the rhetoric of the sems sde literature], this is not true from our point of view, since we are continuing in samsara and gather karma and building up traces. If we are in the state of knowledge that is the state of Samantabhadra, then for us samsara will gave never happened. But until we are in that knowledge 24/7/365 and therefore totally beyond time, then we are still in samsara. 

Since vidyā is not the basis, by mistaking the nature of the sounds, lights and rays that come from the basis for being dualistic phenomena, one is trapped by avidyā, ma rig pa and one cycles endlessly in the three realms. Dzogchen practice is the means the reverse this error because the basis of knowledge and ignorance is the same, and knowledge and ignorance arise on the basis of an awareness [shes pa] that exists as part of the basis. 

My book expends a little energy in explaining these critical points in an introduction, but my explanation is not novel nor is it my own. I merely follow an outline that is common in both Chos and Bon Dzogchen teachings, and I use many citations from untranslated commentaries of Vimalamitra on the 17 Dzogchen tantras to illustrate my points. The only novel thing in my explanation is that I show the link between the initial shes pa, awareness or fundamental consciousness that arises from the basis, how that becomes pristine consciousness [ye shes] when in the presence of rig pa or knowledge of its own state; and how it becomes yid kyi rnam shes or "mental consciousness" and mind [sems] when it does not recognize its own state and engages in the dualistic imputations of because of ignorance [ ma rig pa]. But even here, I do so on the basis of citations and reasonings drawn from classic commentaries, and I cannot claim any of these ideas as novel or as being my own.

* The principle of sounds, lights and rays is more fully explained in the Zhang Zhung sNyan brGyud of Bon; in Chos, it is mainly confined to describing the experience of the bardo of dharmatā.

There is no different interpretation. Please consult JLA. Knowledge is the more correct word.

We have discussed this before, and this state of affairs is mainly due to the influence of western translators on Tibetan Lamas, not the other way around.

Rig pa and the gzhi are not identical. Why? Because if they were, the gzhi would never mistaken for an external object. It is because one is ignorant [ma rig pa] of the gzhi that samsara happens.

When you read my forthcoming book, you will then understand how it is that rig pa neither the nature of the mind, nor the gzhi.

Rig pa fundamentally means "knowledge of the basis." Rig pa is not the nature of the mind. The basis is the nature of the mind. This is a point that Chogyal Namkhai Norbu stresses again and again. Of course, if you are a follower of Jaxchen, well, then...
