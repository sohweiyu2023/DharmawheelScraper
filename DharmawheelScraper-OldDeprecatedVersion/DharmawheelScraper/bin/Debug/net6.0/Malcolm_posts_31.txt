There is nothing false about the teachings brought to Tibet by Ācārya Padmasambhava, Paṇḍita Vimalamitra and Lotsawa Vairocana. Even Tsongkhapa accepted Dzogchen teachings as valid. I advise you to read the ཞུ་ལན་སྨན་མཆོག་བདུད་རྩིའི་ཕྲེང་བ by Tsongkhapa where he records a dialogue between himself and his Nyingma Guru Laykyi Dorje who acted as a intermediary between Tsongkhapa and Vajrapani.

I was responding in kind to your biased statement. 

The teaching of Vajradhara also is the result that does not arise from cause, the intimate instruction that does not arise from scripture, and the buddhahood that does not come from mind. Merely because you have not received this teaching does not make it false. Your incredulity also makes it no less the teaching of Buddha Vajradhara. Garab Dorje is a predicted emanation of Vajradhara. Again, just because you do not read these tantras does not make them invalid.

Magnus, 

Rinpoche states again and again it is better to have bodhicitta based on recognition of one's real state then the contrived bodhicitta of common Mahāyāna. He is not saying bodhicitta is unnecessary, he is distinguishing contrived bodhicitta from authentic bodhicitta and the need to give rise to the latter rather than the former since the former is not stable and can disappear in a second. 

For this reason, he uses the generation of bodhicitta that comes from the Anuyoga tantras:

I and all sentient beings
have always been buddhas;
recognizing this to be so, 
I generate supreme bodhicitta.

It quite depends on whether they are using the word prakriti or svabhāva.

To Tsongkhapa's credit actually, his realization is supposed to have dawned as a result of reading the Buddhapalitavṛtti, which was translated in the early period by Cogro and carefully preserves this distinction, though there are other faults with it.

As for your first question. There are of course other differences, but the they are mainly technical, not practical. Dzogchen has a more extensive explanation of the basis, and differentiates between the basis (gzhi), and the mind that apprehends the basis (kun gzhi). In Mahāmudra this distinction is not made. However, the essential difference between Dzogchen and other systems is thögal. Otherwise, Mahāmudra, Lamdre, Trekchö and so on all have the same main point, equipoise in a moment of unfabricated consciousness aka tha mal gyi shes pa.

The scorpion is a messenger of Guru Dragpo. It is based on the taming of the gyalpo spirit Pehar at Samye Monastery. 

Once, when Padmasambhava was teaching there, there Pehar manifested as a young monk and asked Padmasambhava what he feared most. Padmasambhava replied, in Tibetan, that he most feared sdig pa, misdeeds. Pehar, misunderstanding, thought Padmsambhava was referring to scorpions (also spelled sdig pa). The next day a huge scorpion terrified Samye, and Padmsambhava manifesting as the wrathful guru, seized the scorpion by its tail and threatened it with a vajra. 



There is no connection with the Zodiac.

The point is that uncommon śamatha and vipāśyāna is based on knowledge you have. Common śamatha and vipāśyāna is no different than sutrayāna practice. The former is based on direct introduction, and it is basically the same as the four samadhis of Dzogchen Sems sde: calmness (gnas pa), immovability (mi g.yo ba), nonduality (gnyis med) and natural perfection (lhun grub).

The first is called "śamatha," because one cultivates an experience of a state of calmness. The second is called "vipaśyāna," because one recognizes that movement and calmness are identical in nature. These leads to the experience of their nonduality, and finally, the experience of natural perfection. 

But all four of these samadhis are based on having had an experience of the nature of the mind based on direction introduction. In reality, these samadhis are not practiced gradually but are four qualities of equipoise on the nature of the mind. 

It is a very common belief among Dzogchen teachers that Gampopa borrowed the four samadhis and changed their names, since he had started out as a Dzogchen practitioner. Further, Dzogchen teachers very often teach the four yogas of Mahāmudra when they teach sems sde, for example, Adzom Drugpa, Tulku Orgyen and so on.

When one lives in a liberal, democratic society, one should understand the importance of the separation of church and state.

I certainly support Buddhist women who prefer not to have abortions. However, your notion that "lives have been lost" due to abortion is a religious opinion, not a universally agreed upon fact. Therefore, I cannot in good conscience seek to legislate laws that limit a women's right to choose what do to with her own body and the tissues that reside in it since not all women are Buddhists. But we live in a society where free speech is cherished, and so people who are against abortion for this and that reason have a right to speak out against the practice as long as they do so legally. 

Engaged Buddhism, like liberation theology, is essentially a class-based interpretation of Buddhist social action, which seeks to bring fairness to all living beings (sentient and otherwise), not only human beings. As such, Buddhism also cannot support the ecological and economic irrationality of Capitalism and its oppressive practices anymore than it can support Communism. In practice therefore, engaged Buddhists tend to follow Deep Ecology.

If you carefully study Nāgārjuna, you will note that there is no interplay nor processes at all. Conventionally speaking, causes cannot exist before their effects (because they will then be noncauses), they cannot exist at the same time either (because they will then be noncauses). Causes and effects therefore can neither be the same nor different.

No, Mādhyamaka shows that since there are no entities which can withstand analysis, there are no interactions which can withstand analysis.

Claiming that there are no entities but that there are processes or interactions is a misunderstand of dependent origination in toto.  Dependent origination = non-origination.

You should realize that Newland's statements are obviously speculative and cannot be born out by examining what Bhavaviveka himself actually states in his criticism of Samkhya and Buddhapalita's argument against it. This is why, among non-Gelug Mādhyamikas, it is generally held that Bhavaviveka's arguments are more effective at refuting non-Buddhists, while Candrakīrtī's arguments are more persuasive against Buddhists. Further, since inherent existence appears to no-one, ever, anywhere, at anytime, and is a learned object of negation, Bhavaviveka confines the objet of refutation to the coarse object of refutation, existence. 

By treating Bhavaviveka the way you do, you are effectively saying that everything is a nail, and so you will only use a hammer, when sometimes, in some cases, a saw is needed.

The self proposed by ātmanāvadins is permanent, unchanging, and unconditioned, just the way inherent existence is defined. 

As someone mentioned before, Bhavaviveka asserts that consciousness is a suitable conventional basis for designation a self, but Candra rejects this and asserts out there is no suitable basis for designating a self, even conventionally. Instead Candra says that I-making is a habit which imputes a nonexistent. He also claims this habit is capable of generating karma and experiencing its ripening. The habit of course is a dependently originated phenomena, but the I which it imputes does not exist at all. Likewise, the imputation of inherent existence arises in dependence, but that imputation is a false one, like the imputation of self.

The imputation of a self exists I.e., the conception exists, but it is a false imputation since it has no valid basis of designation. The proposition of a self is exactly the same as proposing inherent existence. The refutation of one is the refutation of the other.

In other words, the negation of the self does not confirm a merely existing self. It merely points to its absence in the aggregates, and so on. 

This is also why existence is included in inherent existence sui generis. The Buddha said it is fine to use say "self" as long as one understood nothing real was indicated. It is the same with the term existence.

Since self and inherent existent are synonyms, if there is a valid basis for designating a self there should be a valid designation for designating inherent existence since a self and internet existence are one and the same thing. 

Instead Candra rejects all bases of designation of a self, asserting in its place that the imputation of self needs to no basis of designation because it is wholly unreal. 

Some people get confused about this point because it is certain that the thought of a self arises in dependence on appearances which are mistakenly designated a self, but in fact there is no valid basis of designation a self. Those who do not understand this point do not understand the profound point of Prasanga.

I am saying that is the elimination of afflictions is in general sufficient for most people, without this imperative for "perfection." One, it sets up false expectations. Two, it is unattainable in this lifetime for 99.999% of humans beings. What I am saying is that the overcoming suffering of afflictions and perfection are not coterminous. Even in terms of bodhicitta, there is aspirational bodhicitta where one recognizes that the goals one wishes for oneself and others are likely not within ones power. Engaged bodhicitta also have limits, since it is aspiration.

Not sure how "perfect" they all are. For example, first stage bodhisattvas still experience ripening karma and are subject to afflictive pride, etc. This is why the six impure bhumis are called "impure," since bodhisattvas has not eradicated all afflictive traces. 

We hold out the Buddha as an example of a "perfect" being. But what does this really even mean? Have we ever met such a being? Of course not. 

Thus, we then are instructed to do the next best thing, which is to regard our gurus (if we are practicing Vajrayāna) to be buddhas in person, actual buddhas despite their obvious human flaws and failings, which we are instructed to ignore since they are inevitable. 

Maybe it is better to view all these things from the Prajñāpātamitā Sūtras standpoint of original purity since in reality our state and the state of buddhahood are not two different states.

Longchenpa considers the definitive view to be Prasaṅga Madhyamaka and the definitive sūtras to be the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras. 

But in reality this interpretation of the three turnings comes from a Korean commentary on the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra preserved in the Tibetan canon. There is no evidence the Indian masters ever paid any serious attention to this idea. It is mostly a Tibetan obsession inspired by a Korean guy.

The Sakya Master Loppon Sonam Tsemo has the best approach when he cites one of the commentary tantras of the Guhyasamaja, which to paraphrase states, the single vajra word is heard by different people of different capacities who wrote down different meanings according to what they heard the Buddha say.

Now you are conflating two different systems: Madhyamaka, which is a method for eradicating wrong views in Buddhadharma, and the Abhisamayālaṃkara, which is a Yogacāra work on the Prajñāpāramita Sūtras that brilliantly, but rather arbitrarily, imposes a structure of paths and stages on the Prajñāpāramita Sūtras. It is important to take note of the fact that Tibetan Tradition has selected the Madhyamaka interpretation of this work (those of Ārya Vimktisena and Haribhadra, etc.) over the Yogacāra commentators on this work (Vasubandu, etc.). This is mostly a result of Tibetan scholastic fortunes in the 10th and 11th century, and never had much to do with the intellectual merits of this or that commentarial tradition.

You need to read Haribhadra on this point. What he says, in essence, is that the path and everything in it, up to Buddhahood is an illusion, a false appearance, and when we attain buddhahood, we look back and realize we were never deluded to begin with. In other words, we are illusory sentient beings following an illusory path to attain an illusory buddhahood which in the end we realize we never needed to follow. Why? Just as when one understands that an illusory elephant is just a trick of the eyes created by the magician, likewise, one understands that all of samsara and nirvana are just tricks created by afflictions. When one sees through the trick, one recognizes that the elephant never existed; likewise, when one attains buddhahood, one recognizes one was never deluded.

You can find much discussion of such things out there. We can find out that Schrödinger wrote in his book My View of the World: “In all the world, there is no kind of framework within which we can find consciousness in the plural; this is simply something we construct because of the temporal plurality of individuals, but it is a false construction….The only solution to this conflict in so far as  any is available to us at all lies in the ancient wisdom of the Upanishad.”

So again, you find confirmation of QP in the doctrine of the Perfection of Wisdom, Schrödinger and Heisenberg in the Upanishads, and then we have the very well funded ID community, lead by the Templeton Foundation. It is normal that people wish to find confirmation of their religious beliefs in science, and indeed, that is HHDL's main intent. I personally think is better to let religions be religions, politics be politics, and science be science.

But this assertion is in itself not correct. Designations are dependent on appearances. But appearances are not dependent on designations. Designations do not bootstrap appearances into existence. 

Further, you are making an assertion of parabhāva, other or dependent existence. We have already discussed this before.

In the Yogacāra model all external perceptions of the three realms is accounted for by traces (vasanas) which exist in the mind streams of sentient beings. These vasanas are traces of actions and act as seeds which when meeting special conditions ripen into karmic appearances. Because these traces are so deep, sentient beings in general never question appearance of their common container universe. It is more detailed than this, but this is a brief overview of how it works.

This means that all collective appearances arise from common karmic traces, while individual appearances arise from specific traces. Thus all hell beings share common traces to experience a hell realm, but the individual suffering of each one is based on traces unique to that individual.

In your opinion. I think that pretending that Madhyamaka offers solutions to questions in in physics is harmful and misleading. Religion is religion. Science is science. They should be kept separate. Why? Because one must inevitably be the master of the other if they intrude too much on each other's proper domain. 

The domain of Buddhadharma is bring suffering to an end. The domain of physics is to offer a description of matter and its modes. 

While it is tempting to allow Buddhadharma to intrude on science and vice versa, the outcome is that both suffer.

They do not act as particles or waves, they are best described sometimes as particles or sometimes as waves. Albert Einstein wrote: "It seems as though we must use sometimes the one theory and sometimes the other, while at times we may use either. We are faced with a new kind of difficulty. We have two contradictory pictures of reality; separately neither of them fully explains the phenomena of light, but together they do."

And of course, there is still no absolute consensus on the issue, with some contemporary 21st century physicists arguing that in reality all we are observing is particles, and others arguing that all we are observing is pure waves of matter. Thus, I really do not see how any version of Madhyamaka is going to help this situation along.

Nope, this does not work. You are claiming that appearances in correct relative truth have more ontological substance that appearances in false relative truth. In other words, you are claiming that the appearances in correct relative truth are less "mere" than illusions that truly are "mere appearances" as that is all they are. When you say that both correct and false relative truths are mere appearances you are claiming they have equal status. But you qualify the latter as "functional." Thus you are making the claim that these appearances are more real than the others. 

It would be better for you to say that correct relative truth is mere existence, while false relative truth is mere appearance, as opposed to true nonexistents like the sons of barren women and hairy turtles which have no causes for arising. 

This is the point of my saying your understanding of delusion is not subtle enough. Candra is quite clear: all relative truths are objects of false cognitions. This means that even conventional truths are actually delusions, subtle delusions, as opposed to coarse delusions.

Yogacara and Madhyamaka represent to different approaches to Mahāyāna, so we agree on that much. The former is constructionist, in that they engage in many detailed explanations and the elaborations of positions based on the Buddha's teachings found principally in the Samdhinirocana Sūtra, Lankāvatāra Sūtra and so on. The latter is deconstructionist, principally following the prajñāpārāmita sūtras. There is of course a third school, the Tathātagarbha school which is based on the ten tathāgatagarbha sūtras, but in terms of treatises it is represented only by the Uttaratantra, its commentary, and some texts attributed to Nāgārjuna. 

The point is that neither of these three schools promote a separate path. All three schools promote the same path, with different understandings of consciousness and reality, and different methodologies for ascertaining the same. Madhyamaka's approach, as you correctly note, is strictly critical.

My personal motivation is that people understand what Madhyamaka is and what it is not. It is a critical method used to prune wrong views. It is not a spiritual philosophy nor does it make any propositions of its own. It serves strictly as a critical method for removing misconceptions about what the Buddha taught, that's all. 

So for example, when you proclaim that Madhyamaka philosophy solves the mystery of quantum physics, this is wrong on two counts: 1) Madhyamaka is not a philosophy, since as explained above it make no propositions of its own. 2) Madhyamaka has no role in confirming mundane theories such as quantum physics, much less karma. If Madhyamaka is to play a role in quantum physics, it would be merely to show that propositions in quantum physics suffer from internal contradictions if and when quantum physicists make ultimate truth claims that contradict the teachings of the Buddha (i.e. claiming there is arising from self, other, both or without a cause). To the extent that they do not do this, Madhyamaka has no interest in quantum physics.

Madhyamaka does not set forth propositions or claims about anything. As Buddhapalita so clearly states, Madhyamaka does not make the claim that this or that does not exist; it merely removes claims that this or that exists without the need for adding the qualifier "inherently." This also does not preclude those who write about Madhyamaka from writing about other issues, such as the Bodhisattva path, Abhidharma, Vajrayāna and so on, for example, Śantideva wrote not only the Bodhicaryāvatara, but also the Compendium of Training (Śiksasammucaya). Nāgārjuna I wrote not only on Madhyamaka, but he also wrote a short text on Ayurveda called the Jivasūtra, as well as a detailed discourse on Mahāyāna training called Ratnavali. You should read it, it is really quite remarkable.

Without entering into refuge on the Buddha's path, one is not following a correct path. Without developing the aspiration for supreme awakening, one is following a lower path. Without understanding that all phenomena are natureless, free from the four extremes, nonarising and inexpressible, one will be subject to conceptual proliferation and be long delayed in attaining buddhahood— as Mañjuśrī said Sachen, "If grasping arises, one does not have the view."

Both Yogacara and Madhyamaka offer perspectives on the Mahāyāna path, but the latter is strictly critical.

No, the paths are the path of application, preparation, seeing, cultivation, and no more training. The Madhyamakāvatāra does not explain these things in any detail, it merely mentions in passing the perfections and their results. It is not a manual for practicing them, like the Bodhicaryāvatāra, for example. For example, in his autocommentary, Candrakīrti devotes very little time to an exposition of anything other than the sixth bhumi. He devotes 12 folios to the first five bhumis, 40 folios on the sixth bhumi, and another 12 folios on the bhumis 7-10. In other words, he devotes two thirds of his entire text to one bhumi.

There are virtually no Madhayamaka texts which illustrate the bodhisattva path. This is because Madhyamaka and Yogacara present the same path; while having differences over the nature of consciousness and reality. The texts by Madhyamaka authors that treat the path (the Abhisamayālaṃkara literature) are taxonomic, and do not present a path different than that of the Yogacara masters since the Abhisamayālaṃkara was written by a Yogacara master, Maitreyanatha. 

The collection of reasoning and the praises of Nāgārjuna are entirely critical. One might imagine Āryadeva's 400 to be a path text. In reality, it engages in what you would like to call "conventional analysis" for the first four chapters and ultimate analysis for the final four chapters. But in general, it does not present a path. It is wholly concerned with correcting misconceptions. 

It is really only Śantideva that presents a Madhyamaka path text, and to a lesser extent, Nāgārjuna's Ratnavali. 

But for the most part, Nāgārjuna and other Madhyamakas are concerned only with refuting the mistaken views of others without putting forward some unique view called "Madhyamaka." They are instead attempting to critically restore the Buddha's middle way.

We all know that there is no water in a mirage and no elephant in an illusion. What we seem to not understand is that there is no water in water or an elephant in an elephant either.  The point of Madhyamaka is to show that there is no water in water nor elephants in elephants. If you don't understand that, you don't understand Madhyamaka. It is very simple.

Now the negation of inherent existence will only be a nonaffirming negation if someone proposes something as being inherently existent and you directly negate it without proposing something in its place. 

But you set forth the negation of inherent existence as a negation that affirms (ma yin 'gag) your own tenet system. Therefore, you are using the term incorrectly.

It is just as Nāgārjuna states in the Ratnavali:

there will be however be non-existence,

None of Śantideva's Indian commentators understand this to mean the "true existence of..." and translated non-entity as emptiness is quite strange and wrong. 

The primary commentator, Prajñākaravarman, states:

As such, this means that when neither an entity nor a nonentity remain before the mind of the yogi, because at that time an apprehensible aspect does not appear, all concepts are pacified through the absence of perception.

The problem here is the notion of "the generic image of emptiness." Emptiness cannot have a generic image since emptiness is not a thing, like a vase and its blueness. Meditating on the concept, "this is empty" is also unworkable. Of course, when we are learning about emptiness, of course we have to come to confidence in emptiness rationally, through reasonings. But when it comes to applying confidence in meditation, it is the position of the Sakya and Nyingma schools that focusing on a concept of emptiness is not a correct vipaśyāna, and in fact can lead to rebirth in the formless realms. 

Correct vipaśyāna meditation on emptiness is resting the mind in an objectless equipoise discovered through exhausting all possible conceptual proliferation concerning entities in terms of all modes of their existence, as Śantideva notes. It is not resting the mind on the concept that results from conceptual analysis, rather, the mind that deconstructs even the notion., "this is ultimate" and rests in that state, free of proliferation.

There is no need to reconcile them. Relative truth is an appearance to a nonanalytical mind. Ultimate truth is found upon analysis of those appearances. Why? Because as Candra points out, all things bear two natures, one relative (pre-analytical) and one ultimate (post-analytical). This is why, until Buddhahood, there is an equipoise (ultimate truth) and post-equipoise (relative truth) phase of insight meditation. In buddhahood, the mind is completely integrated with ultimate truth, and there is no division into equipoise and post-equipoise. The buddhas have no false cognitions at all.

When you negate existence, it is not so much a negation as a not finding. When analyzed, things are not found to exist, not exist, both and neither, both in the relative and the ultimate. We don't negate existence, but when sought, it is not found. In other words, there is an appearance, when it is examined, its existence cannot be found in its parts, in one part, or separate from its parts, etc. In other words, we accept appearances as they are prior to analysis, since a relative truth is an appearance to a nonanalytical mind. When appearances are analyzed however, they cannot withstand analysis. According to you however, appearances can bear analysis. For example, a snake is an appearance to nonanalytical mind; the rope is an appearance to a mind that has embarked upon analysis, but if we stop analyzing there, the rope remains a false appearance, because it is composed of parts, etc. When subjected to an ultimate analysis, no rope is found when sought.

When neither entities nor nonentities are present before the mind,
since at that time there is no other aspect, it is without an object, totally peaceful.

But it really does not.

The reason why Nāgārjuna refutes four extremes is that Jains, for example, maintain that things both exist and do not exist simultaneously, thus the refutation of the third extreme is needed, or the speculation that in the phase of arising, an entity may be said to both exist and not exist, as in the opinion of some Abidharmikas. Nonexistence is refuted because the Carvakas hold that a self which exists now is later annihilated, and existence is refuted in order to eliminate the belief that existents are veridical and nondeceptive, etc. 

Production from self is refuted because this is what the Saṃkhya school holds, production from other is what the Vaiśeṣika school holds, and production without causes is what the Carvakas hold, and so on. 

Each and every one of Nāgārjuna's refutations has as specific opponent in mind, and it is sloppy to think that one can simply clean them them with a pen because one imagines they are unnecessary double negatives. 

Thus when the Buddha or Nāgārjuna says, "Not existent, not nonexistent, not both existent and nonexistent, and not neither existent and nonexistent" he has a specific opponent or class of assertions in mind which he is negating, one by one. Since these points of view are very possible in the mind and can be and are held, it is necessary to go through each one, step by step, in order to eliminate the faulty conceptualization which produces them in one's own mind. 

Negating inherent existence only addresses the first extreme, but not the rest. That is the point.

I don't think the Tsongkhapa's treatment of inherent existence is a pernicious obsctruction—&nbsp;everyone agrees that phenomena have no inherent existence. The disagreement 1) is over the issue of the intellectual history of Madhyamaka in India, and 2) over novelties in Tsongkhapa's own interpretation which seem unwarranted when Indian Madhyamaka is examined. 

Finally, the purpose of these conversations is to eliminate concepts which lead us deeper into the cave, for everyone involved, including myself.

Finally, the reason why this conversation comes up again and again is because of the historical accident that the political dominance of the Ganden Phodrang propelled the teachings of Tsongkhapa to prominence and thus, they were the first version of Tibetan Madhyamaka to which early Western Buddhist scholars had access. This has skewed Madhyamaka studies in the West almost from the beginning.

It is quite clear what you are saying. The problem is quite simply that you have an axe to grind with other physicists, and are using Madhyamaka incorrectly in order to bolster your claims about the lack of accounting for consciousness as a factor in observations of quantum phenomena. The problem with your whole theory is that Madhyamaka does not make any statements about consciousness per se. In Buddhadharma, theories about consciousness belong to Abhidharma and Yogacāra. At best, Madhyamakas are like Supreme Court justices, who are only interested in resolving ultimate truth claims. 

You have claimed, over and over again that quantum physics is plagued by problems of inherency. It is true that physicalists regard the material world as real in the strong sense, in varying degrees. But their notion of the real does not necessitate that things are permanent, constant, unchanging, and independent— the ancient sense of "the real" that Madhyamaka critiques. 

Instead the modern sense of the real is "the matter of fact." So for some physicists, the big bang is a matter of fact, i.e., real, until it is proven otherwise. In other words, the notion of the real in modern science is pragmatic, ala Charles Pierce, who echoes quite well the notion of conventional truth in Madhyamaka, "The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed upon by all who investigate is what we mean by the truth, and the object represented in this opinion is the real."

The Buddhist perspective is that matter arises from consciousness, in fact. This is clearly stated by Vasubandhu in the Kośa. 

Also, I did not say this, "Yogacara or materialism." My point was that Kenneth original proclaimed that solution to QM was to overthrown substance dualism. He then retreated on this point when I pointed out to him that there really are only two choices if we choose substance monism: everything is either a mental event or a physical event.

I think the problem here is that you are not defining your terms well. Physicist in general tend to be physicalists, that is, they reject the idea that there is some kind of mind which exists separate from materials processes, if they even accept that mind exists at all. Hence they tend to be substance monists. You keep claiming they are dualists, in general, and I do not see how you can make this generalization. Your claim is something like the "all true scotsman" fallacy.

However, whether or not all physicists, some physicists or none of them are substance dualists or physicalists, this has no bearing at all on whether or not they agree in principle that observation affects the outcomes of experiments in quantum mechanics. Einstein rejected this idea, but his rejection of this, his insistence that there had to be an actual physical event which correlates to an observation, has been dismissed for 80 years.

And as I pointed out, the problem of inherency is not an issue in the modern philosophy of science and hasn't been since Hume. 

One can be a total physicalist ala Dennet, and the idea that states are determined also by the observation is no less true. Madhyamaka does not solve that issue. Madhyamaka is the extraneous to that. 

When you collapse mind/matter dualism, you have two choices, all events are mental events (Yogacāra) or all events are physical events (Dennet, etc.). This still does not prevent the observation of phenomena.

There is a tantra devoted to discussing this issue called the sku gdung 'bar ba. It also has a 150 folio long commentary. I'll get to it in a couple of years. In brief however it discusses the kinds of signs one has at the time of death and in the bardo, and how others can know from these one's realization. it also discusses signs from past lives which are discernible in this lifetime and so on. 

It is all really a question of whether you trust what the Buddha has said in Dzogchen tantras and teachings. If you don't trust this, and approach this issue from the point of view of the eight lower vehicles, then it probably means Dzogchen is not an appropriate teaching for you yet. But there is always hope. Even hearing the word "Dzogchen" means that you will eventually attain liberation through Dzogchen teachings.

Unicorns are imputations. Horse are imputations. Now you have to define the difference between a false one and a true one. And that is where you start making ontological assertions. A true imputation involves a correspondence theory between what you perceive and what is out there. Now, we already know that a correspondence theory is invoked by Candrakīrti on the basis of the distinction between two modes of false cognitions: 1) false cognitions about natures 2) false cognitions about common appearances, i.e., seeing one moon as opposed to two. 

However, this does not bear up to analysis either since in the experience of a yogi, he or she may see a given space as the pure land of Avalokiteśvara, Potala, where we all see a midden heap filled with trash. In this case then, is the experiential appearances of a yogi deluded, like the drunk's perception of two moons? A madmen too may see his region as the Potala buddhafield. A madman too may believe he is Avalokiteśvara.

Appearances are the object of analysis, but they are not the object of negation. For example, when we have a moon in the water, we do not say, that moon in the water does not exist. We do however subject it to analysis to understand that it is not the real moon. Also the appearance of the moon in the sky is an object of analysis. However, since conventional appearances are not able to bear ultimate analysis, any concept regarding their existence or nonexistence has to be abandoned. It is the only way the creation stage works. For example, the third Docupchen asks Gelugpas, "If for you appearances are conventionally established in the perception of ordinary people, does this not render the creation stage a mere imputation and a false appearance?"

In reality, when practicing Vajrayāna, Gelugpas use a species of Yogacara Madhyamaka just like everyone else.

The actual problem is that the Gelug view promotes relative realism (not nonexistent in the relative) and ultimate nihilism (not existent in the ultimate). 

Your teachers will probably tell you to stop listening to Sakyapas and Nyingmapas. But the truth is that the Gelugpas have never amounted an effective rebuttal to Gorampa or Mipham. The scholar who has the most balanced view about all of this in the modern epoch is HHDL. He is committed to Tsongkhapa's view, but has the largeness of heart to try and understand the critiques against Tsongkhapa's view and to try and see where there is commonality among them. 

The normal trope is that Tsongkhapa explains the view from the perspective of an ordinary person; the Sakyapas explain the view from the perspective of the path; and the Nyingmapas explain the view from the perspective of the result. It is a gross generalization, but there is some truth in it.

First of all, the charge that the Copenhagen interpretation rejects causality is not mine. 

Second, dependent origination is strictly deterministic, "where this exists, that exists; from the arising of that, this arises."

Further, I do not see how quantum mechanics is reaffirming the basic insight that there is no inherent existence. For example, to take your line of thinking, one can make a argument that (half-eggist) Yogacara is affirmed by quantum mechanics because of the overwhelming emphasis in your theory on the role of the observer. For example, in the half-eggist theory, physical phenomena exist, but how they exist for us is determined by our perception of them, much like your collapse of the wave function. 

But in fact, with respect to causality, Buddha is a determinist.

You are going to have to demonstrate to me, in a simple way, why this is correct. Just how does quantum mechanics confirm that "all things are empty of inherent existence because they are dependently originated?"

How so, when for example the standard interpretation of quantum mechanics rejects causality? 

I am sure you are more familiar than I with the intellectual history of quantum mechanics, but how, for example, can you show that causality is necessary, when quantum mechanics theory for the last century 80 years has in general rejected it? 

In order to show that quantum mechanics confirms dependent origination, you would have to show that quantum mechanics confirms causality.

The Buddha's proposition is a simple one, all conditioned entities arise from a cause, and all causes are themselves effects.

This is entirely separate from the notion of the presence or absence of inherent existence, introduced into Buddhism in order to explain causality by ṥrāvakas later on.

When NIda started teaching Mantra Healing though Shang Shung Institute (SSI), Norbu RInpoche felt this was outside the scope of SSI's mission, and so Nida, after fulfilling his obligations to SSI, parted with SSI and struck out on his own. It was not a sudden thing, but a gradual disengagement. Nida's departure seems to have been precipitated by a Sache project Nida had initiated at Mergigar in 2003. Nida, at some cost, had five boulders placed in a meadow (below the Yellow House) at Merigar and painted the colors of the five elements. Norbu Rinpoche really did not like this at all  and immediately had some Dzogchen community people who had helped Nida paint the boulders scrub the paint off with wire brushes. FYI, I was there at the time and witnessed everything first hand. After this point, Nida and SSI began to slowly disengage. 

So I think it is fair to say that there was some substantive disagreements over the direction Nida was taking at SSI, and so in order to be more free to follow his own dictates, Nida moved on, since he was not a student of Norbu Rinpoche. I would not characterize this as a falling out, but rather, a parting of ways after a largely successful collaboration seemed to have run its course. The Italian SSI still teaches Kunye in Nida's style, rather than Dr. Phunstok Wangmo's style. Actually, I think it is good Nida moved on. Diversity is good in education, and hopefully Nida's various projects with respect to Tibetan Medicine will bear fruit.

You, my friend, have a view of emptiness, precisely as Nāgārjuna described it, " the reifying of emptiness, feeling that it is a separate reality existing behind conventional appearances when it is actually the real nature of those appearances."

You think, by making a distinction between separate reality on the one one hand and a real nature on the other that you are avoiding this problem, but it is not so. This exactly the mistake to which Nāgārjuna refers. 

Emptiness is the recognition that the things we perceive are not real. It is not their absence. If you claim emptiness is the absence of things, you are reifying that absence, similar with the one who reifies the mistaken thought of a fairy castle. Thus you are dragged underwater by the crocodile of the view.

On the contrary, Nāgārjuna states:

Emptiness was taught by the victor for the renunciation of views;
they say someone who has a view of emptiness is incurable.

In his commentary to this line, Buddhapalita states:

For example, someone with a confused mind sees a fairy castle and the thought arises in his mind "fairy castle," but when he is free from that confusion and sees it as it truly is, there is no entity called "mistaken thought of a fairy castle" in the mistaken thought of a fairy castle and  he only then becomes free from a concept about a nonexistent. In the same way, when seeing how it truly is, that mistaken emptiness (which arises from the crocodile of the view [of emptiness as an] entity) is not [in fact] an entity called "emptiness." Apart from the mere expression, "emptiness,"  those that view emptiness as an entity have their eye of wisdom obscured by the darkness of ignorance and thus the great doctors, the victors, able to discern for whom a treatment will succeed or not, have said [the treatment] will not succeed [for them]. 

Thus emptiness is merely a therapy for wrong views, and cannot be construed as a view itself. To construe emptiness itself as a view is to render oneself incurable.

The passage means that all assertions of existence are incoherent because they all imply imply inherency. That is why Nāgarajuna says that whoever sees inherent existence, dependent or other-existence, existence or nonexistence has not seen the Buddha's teaching. 

That which arises dependently is free from all of these designations. All of these designations—&nbsp;inherent existence, dependent existence, existence and nonexistence— do not apply to dependently originated phenomena. It is not simply that phenomena are empty solely of inherent existence, they are empty of all forms of existence. Their existence is just a convention, a designation, a mistaken imputation. There is nothing real behind those designations, just as, in the example Śantideva uses, there is no real woman behind the illusory women created by the magician.

This is also why Madhyamaka has no preference for conventional truths, per se. Why? Because all conventional truths depend on imputations of arising and ceasing, coming and going, permanence and annihilation, identity and difference. Dependent origination however is free of those eight, that is why it is called "profound."

In fact, the whole argument boils down to a debate over whether the coarse object of negation, existence, is sufficient, or whether one has to more sharply define the object of negation to inherent existence. All Madhyamakas including Candrakirti and Śantideva along with all Tibetans (outside of Gelug) accept the former point of view. Only Lama Tsongkhapa insists on the latter. 

Even if we accept that the latter is the proper formulation of the object of negation, this still does not mean that Madhyamaka supports any given position about conventional truths, since conventional truths, according to Gelugs, are designations, and designations change over time and in cultures. For example, a conventional truth of ancient Tibet is Meru cosmology. It is not a conventional truth for us. 

When there is another paradigm shift in physics that takes us beyond quantum mechanics in the same way quantum mechanics took us past the clockwork universe of Newton, then quantum mechanics will be deprecated too, and no longer valid outside of a very limited type of operation for which it is effective, like Euclidean geometry today. We can use Euclid, but it is limited in its scope.

What he is saying is that verbal accounts of sight are incoherent and that they do not withstand analysis. That being so, "sight" is merely a convention. 

This is a theme Nāgārjuna uses over and over again in the MMK. To put it in to a more abstract form:

"Apart from what has x-ed and what has not x-ed, there is no [present] x-ing," in which x stands for any verb. 

This same formula is again applied to agents, as in the example you give above of Nāgārjuna's refutation of sight. With respect to characteristics, he refutes the five elements by means of refuting akaśa, space. Since in ancient Buddhist cosmology space is considered to foster the other four elements, if one refutes space, the other four elements are also thereby refuted (here "space" should be conflated with the modern concept of space in physics). 

For example, Buddhapalita states:


Since the result does not exist, where can there be a noncondition or a condition? That being the case, the result is also not acceptable and neither a noncondition nor a condition exist. Since there is neither a result, a condition nor a noncondition. the expression "to arise" is proven to be a mere convention.

The point of Madhyamaka is to show that language does not correspond to the way things are, cannot access the way things are directly, and that the way things are is inexpressible. Even the terms "absence of inherent existence" and "emptiness" are mere conventions which do not indicate anything real.

First of all Kenneth, I have studied Nāgārjuna for 30 years. I really do understand Nāgārjuna quite well.  I have received many teachings on Madhyamaka, and I understand Tibetan quite well. 

The point is that the arising of things is just a convention. In reality, nothing arises and nothing ceases. That is the meaning of dependent origination.

Trying to prove that Madhyamaka backs up one particular version of physics is therefore fruitless because conventions are subject to change.

Before declaring confidently that you understand Madhyamaka, maybe you should also become a little expert in it. At this point, I have to say, your lack of expertise in the subject is a hinderance to your understanding, and it is showing. That said, it is quite clear you have a deep grasp of physics. Spend as much time on Madhyamaka as you have on physics, and then you might have something.

The reason that I translate parabhāva as "dependent existence" is that Buddhapalita comments on it that it is conceived as an existence which is "assisted" by another, similar in meaning to paratantra. 

He continues a little later:

Someone like that, who [has a] view of self existence, dependent existence, existence or nonexistece does not see the truth in the profound as the supreme teaching of the Buddha. Because we, in the correct way, see the nonexistence of the self existence of things which appear because the sun of dependent origination arose, because of that, because we see the truth, liberation is can be accepted only for us.

Recall, existence is only valid if and only if inherent existence is valid. Dependent origination is not possible in the face of inherent existence, and for Nāgārjuna, etc., there is no existence apart from inherent existence.

Nāgarjuna closes the chapter by stating:

‘Is’ is holding to permanence,
‘Is not’ is an annihilationist view.
Because of that, is and is not 
are not made into a basis by the wise. 

Because something is self existent, 
it is permanent because [it is] never non-existent;
‘produced earlier, presently non-existent’,
therefor, the consequence is annihilation. 

TKF's mere existence is refuted here.

Annihilationism, in Buddhadharma, is the assertion that something which exists now, such as a person, will be utterly destroyed later and cease to exist. But this kind of statement is only possible if someone first claims something exists. 

As Buddhapalita says, and as I have stated many times:

It is not that we [Mādhyamikas] claim nonexistence, we merely remove claims for existing existents.

Genetic diseases are karmic diseases.

Inherency has been long abandoned in Western Philosophy, for example, Hume refuted necessary connection, self, and so on in his Inquiry into Human Understanding. 

Further, Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, which is fundamentally what our friend Kenneth is talking about, is old news. 

What I object to, as well as some others, is the reification of Madhyamaka as if it actually proposes how conventional things are supposed to function. There are a variety of theories about this even with Buddhism, which all have their usefulness in different contexts. 

The Buddha as well as Nāgārjuna, are entirely silent on the question of external, dependently originated phenomena. Cosmology is the domain of Abhidharma, and that presentation is now necessarily deprecated. 

The idea of the absence of inherent existence may be a great discovery for Kenneth personally, but he is not the first person to make such a link between this idea and physics. This is why I recommended that Kenneth check out the work of B. Alan Wallace. Wallace not only has an undergraduate degree in physics, but he is quite expert in Madhyamaka studies. He even offers what he calls "a centrist view of physical science." He offers, usefully, "Physics offers us bodies of experimental evidence which can be consistently interpreted in a variety of ways." He then goes on to explore differences in the ways in which this body of evidence may be understood in different cultures, leading to different conventional formulations of its import.

The resistance comes from the fact that Madhyamakas are impartial with respect to presentations of relative truth. Their only interest in with respect to presentations of relative truth is when those presentations make claims which contradict the principles of dependent origination. 

This is the reason for example that followers of Bhavavivkea and Candrakirti largely follow the Sautrantika presentation of relative truth, apart from Sautrantika tenets like partless particles and so on that that conflict with reason and are found to be irrational assertions upon analysis.

I think it is worthwhile for Buddhists to look closely at quantum physics, and I believe that is also why His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, presided over the recent conference on Madhyamika philosophy and quantum physics. Take a look at the title of this article on the conference: "Dalai Lama: Religion Without Quantum Physics Is an Incomplete Picture of Reality" (http://motherboard.vice.com/read/dalai- ... of-reality). So I believe His Holiness, the Dalai Lama, would encourage Buddhists to look more closely at quantum physics, since quantum physics is telling us what our reality is really like.

What my paper shows is that there is something even better than just parallels or intersections between Madhyamika philosophy and quantum physics. Madhyamika philosophy can actually solve the mystery of quantum physics—by interpreting the actual formulation of quantum mechanics explicitly in terms of the Madhyamaka view of reality. Looking at it the other way around, it means that there is now concrete scientific evidence that Madhyamika philosophy is correct. I have deliberately written the paper in such a way that Buddhists, who may not know any mathematics or physics, can also understand it—with a bit of effort, of course. (The paper can be found at http://kenneth-chan.com/physics/direct- ... mechanics/. I would, of course, be happy to clarify things further on this forum if required.)[/quote]

The Madhyamaka view of reality is that whatever ordinary people with healthy sense organs (including minds) hold to be true is true as long is it a) functional b) is not subject to ultimate analysis.

For example, the Madhyamaka refutations of prime movers stem from this principle.  

Therefore, Meru Cosmology, Newtonian Physics, Logical Positivism, Quantum Mechanics, String Theory, etc. can all be considered valid from a Madhyamaka point of view as long as they work and are not subjected to ultimate analysis. 

Now then, this does not mean that Madhyamaka precludes cosmologies and scientific theories from being deprecated and replaced with new ones. But Madhyamaka will never hold up any conventional model of the world as being definitive. I think this is the point you are missing.

Of course, the amount of money spent on social services such as welfare are a tiny percentage of the budget, but no one ever notices this when they bitch about lack of access to social services they imagine "other" people have access to. In other words, your post is basically racist since you imagine you are being held up to a standard that people of color are not being held up to.

Who said volitions were unconditioned? I already explained clearly that in general volitions were included in among the neutral mental factors, and were colored by their association with positive minds (composed of the ten positive mental factors) or negative minds (composed of the six afflicted mental factors and of negative mental factors).

In any case, anyone who wishes to understand karma and vipaka clearly is directed to read the Abhidharmakośa and its commentary.

Awareness of our environment is a conceptual picture built up through familiarization. No one lives in the moment, apart from babies, who have not yet developed the conceptual framework to start organizing their direct perceptions into conceptual patterns and frames of reference. This is why a great deal of secular mindfulness literature and "live in the moment" slogans are total bunk.

For example, when we talk about a nonconceptual experience, we are actually talking about an experience that has very little concept attached to, but it is still a subtle conceptual experience, which why it is can be a deviation if the conceptuality is not recognized. 

Secondly, direct perceptions are by definition nonconceptual, and are only experienced when they are coordinated through second order conceptual identification such as "this is blue," "this is red," and so on. We have many direct perceptions everyday which we never experience because we never notice them.

The Buddha did not reject the idea that people were born into higher and lower social classes as a result of karma:

"Beings are owners of kammas, student, heirs of kammas, they have kammas as their progenitor, kammas as their kin, kammas as their homing-place. It is kammas that differentiate beings according to inferiority and superiority."

Karma is volition. Those volitions can be positive, negative or neutral, and they will result in acts that are positive, negative, or neutral, with results that are correspondingly positive, negative or neutral. 

Therefor, it is novel to claim that actions are  niether positive or negative by nature since volition itself is action, and all volitions are positive, negative or neutral by nature.

You just answered your own question. In the first case, you are taking the five precepts out of deceit. This means that you have severed the root of the positive results from the start because your motivation is negative and therefore your action is negative. In the second, case, you havea positive motivation which leads you do something positive for others. Thus the rule still applies. 

You might want to brush up on the karma chapter of the Kosha.

It is fairly straight foward, actually. Cetana by itself is a neutral mental factor. But it is colored, positively or negatively,  by whether it is accompanied by positive mental factors or negative mental factors. Thus cetanas accompanied by positive mental factors are positive, cetanas acconpanied by negative mental factors are negative. It's not hard to understand.

The Buddha, Nāgārjuna and Vasubandu all say, "Action (karma) is volition (cetana) and what proceeds from volition."

Since derived actions of body and speech arise on the basis of positive or negative intentions which are themselves karma by definition, it is novel to claim that actions cannot be essentially positive or negative. For example, taking the five precepts is an essentially positive action whose ripening is essentially positive. Breaking the five precepts is an essentially negative action whose ripening is essentially negative.

The nature of actions is determined by the motivation that drives them. Actions motivated by hatred, greed or ignorance are essential negative and have negative results, measured by the relative amount of suffering the result of each entails.

One day Candrakīrit was walking though the halls of Nalanda and distracted by a book he was reading, bumped his head on a pillar. A student noticed this and said "Ha, that pillar is not empty, is it!"

Candra, having regained his composure, said "Sure it is," and passed his hand right through it. 

One time, a geshe went to see Milarepa. Thinking that he could defeat Mila in debate, he asked Mila whether space was conditioned or unconditioned. Mila replied, "Certainly space is conditioned." 

The geshe, now thinking that Mila was a great fool, began to refute him with citations and reasonings, while Mila sat quietly until the geshe was finished. Mila then picked up a stick from the ground, and began beating out a rhythm on space, which made a tremendous sound. 

If I were you, I would not place so much confidence in so called "functional appearances."

In reality there aren't six. There is only one. The different names for sense consciousness do not describe six different consciousness, they describe one functioning through six different sense organs, for example, like a monkey in a house with six or eight windows. 

That consciousness is nonconceptual is not even slightly debatable. Conceptuality, and hence, experience, is the function of the caittas. Cittas are nonconceptual.

Anyone who properly enters Vajrayāna should have confidence that they will, at worst, attain buddhahood within sixteen lives. 

The final chapter of all Lamrim texts exhort the practitioner to enter Vajrayāna teachings if they wish to wake up in one, three, seven or at most, sixteen lifetimes. 

This life is short. Not entering Vajrayāna teachings if one has the chance is a waste of this precious human birth with its eighteen freedoms and endowments. It is unlikely this chance will come around again soon. Lack of confidence in one's own capacity is a māra.
