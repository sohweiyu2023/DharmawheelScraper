The word realization, rtogs pa, is used very loosely, to describe all kinds of things. In Tibetan, it runs the gamut from merely understanding something, all the way up to realizing buddhahood. So when we hear that "X is realized", everyone thinks they know what this means, but actually, without some qualification, it is kind of a meaningless statement. Realized what? The path of accumulation, application, seeing? The creation stage? The completion stage? Emptiness? etc.

Umm no. Tibetans themselves had a negative attitude towards Christianity, beginning with the expulsion of Nestorians from Tibet in the mid-8th century on up, the establishment of a Catholic church and in Ladakh, which was established in 1625 and shut down in 1640, with all the missionaries and converts exiled. The Capuchins were expelled in 1760.  Catholic churches were burned, Catholics were executed, and four French missionaries were tortured and executed in Batang, Khams during the Batang uprising of 1905 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Batang_uprising).

Tibetans have a very negative attitude towards Islam and Muslims in general. Tibetan Buddhists generally have very negative attitude towards Bonpos, and the legends of Indian Mahasiddhas are filled with negative portrayals of Hindus.

It is unlikely that this text was commonly read on its own, and its citations would mostly be mined from citations. 

In the Śikṣāsammucayais a long citation of ff. 161a-161b, ff. 165b-166a., f.171a, 183a-183b
In Bhavaviveka's Prajñāpradipa, there is a citation of f. 166b, f. 167a
In the Kāyatravṛtti, there is a citation of 166.b, etc. 
In Prajñāpradipatika, f. 167, etc. 
In Bodhicaryāvatarapanjika, f. 177
In Prasannapāda, f.202b,

Etc. This sūtra is most commonly, but not exclusively, cited by Indian Mādhyamikas. There are a large number of passages from it in the 
Vyākhyāyuktitika,  few in the Śravākabhumi, the Abhisamayaalmḳara commentaries also have several. 

I would say that this sūtra was more important to Mādhyamikas.

The Tibetans know this sūtra under its short title, གསང་བ་བསམ་གྱིས་མི་ཁྱབ་པའི་མདོ, the Sūtra of the Inconceivable Secret. It is regularly cited by scholars in every school.

Vajrayāna is a subdivision of Mahāyāna, not something separate. 

It is necessary, because it is a vital part of the our path. If we do not understand these paths and stages, we will not know how to practice them. Zoning out in teachings is not necessarily a bad thing, more often than not it is a sign that we are eliminating traces of ignorance. 

We do not want to be like horses with blinders on, only seeing what is directly in front of us on the road. This is not a good way to hear and reflect on teh Dharma. Moreover, by hearing of the experiences of the paths and stages, it can cause us to be inspired about the possibility of our attaining them and cause rejoicing in those who have attained them.

Because it is necessary to understand what kinds of experiences one will have on the path, even if one has not reached this or that stage.

Knowledge is not a hindrance. Ignorance is. 

First, one generates bodhicitta, the desire to liberate all sentient beings from samsara. This has two aspects, ultimate and relative. The relative aspect refers to the aspiration, and then practicing the six perfections. Ultimate bodhicitta means practicing śamatha and vipaśyanā. 

One practices these two bodhicitta together, until one realizes emptiness. This is the first bodhisattva bhumi. One continues to practice, until the practice of vipaśyanā has eradicated all traces of affliction (desire, hatred, and ignorance). This happens conventionally, at the seventh bhumi. Ultimately, has eradicated all traces of grasping to personal and phenomena identity, and one attains the omniscience of buddhahood, this happens when one transitions from being a tenth stage bodhisattva to buddhahood. A buddha is a totally realized person. There is no other kind of totally or fully realized person.

Actually, I was wrong, the Lanka is mentioned in the Sūtrasammucaya, but even here, there is some difficulty, since the Lanka's gatha section predicts Nāgārjuna, and thereby portions of the Lanka definitely date later than Nāgārjuna himself. One would can run the Tibetan or Sanskrit texts of the Lanka through the Buddhanexus program, and find out specifically which verses in Nāgārjuna's works match, and then see whether which phrases are in which part of the Lanka, and whether they date from before or after Nāgārjuna. The Lanka was not compiled in a day, but like other Mahāyāna sūtras shows considerable evidence of multiple layers of composition.

The term in Sanskrit is "saṃvara," in Tibetan "sdom." These two terms mean "restraint." Pratimokṣa means "personal liberation." Pratimokṣa samvara therefore means "the restraints one adopts for personal liberation."

2 : an order issued by legally constituted authority to a subordinate official

Definition of vow (noun)

Burning with what? Burning with the fire of lust, with the fire of hate, with the fire of delusion.

There is a major difference between this forum and E-Sangha. At its peak that latter had 50,000 users. There were child predators and charlatans, people posing as teachers, etc. It was a major headache. This is why we felt we had to institute standards. At one point, I even had a to call the FBI to deal with a pedophile. Then Jundo decided to threaten to sue us, and forum began to split up. When it crashed, and the backups were lost in the process, that was the end of it. Then David copied E-Sangha, and opened Dhammawheel, then Dharmawheel.

As for titles, thats fine, but that presented another problem, especially with Zen. American Zen is not Japanese Zen, and often there is no official recognition of Zen teachers by Japanese institutions. 

Also, in Tibetan Buddhism, there is no official system for handing out titles other than Geshe, Khenpo, and Tulku. It is all ad hoc. There are no official qualifications for assuming the title "Lama" other than being given the title by one's teacher or, as is often the case, moving to America and calling oneself Lama x (this is called ocean promotion). The exception to this is Geshe and Khenpo, these are rigorous 12-14 year programs, with official degrees, ranks, etc. But there are no geshes and khenpos here as far as I know.

In fact, it was the attempt on Esangha to get people posing as ordained people on the forum, lama so and so, zen master x, bhiksu sunya, etc., that brought created the most trouble and bad feelings. Why? Because when they presented spurious or otherwise unverifiable information, we had to curtail their participation. A number of zen priests argued they were every bit as much ordained as a fully ordained bhikshu. We did not accept this position, and I still don’t. But it lead to a lot of bad feeling.

I provided citations from one of the tantras that serve as the locus classicus for sahaja, the Hevajra Tantra, above. I've already pointed out that this term is complex. For example, there is a connate of the cause, the connate of the path, and the connate of the result, as detailed by Dombi Heruka in his Sahajasiddhi. According to him, the cause, the mind itself, is the connate nonarising reality of entities. And I provided a Saraha citation as well. So, basically, your objection is unnecessary.

It means that in the first moment that the basis arises up from the basis, one does not know what these appearances are. Hence the term "connate ignorance" (lhan cig skyes ma rig pa). 

Sahajajñāna on the other hand, lhan cig skyes pa'i ye shes, refers to the wisdom that one discovers by oneself, so it is a synonym of rang byung ye shes. It does not really mean "connate" at all, in this context. 

It is a complicated term, connate for example can refer to the cause, the three afflictions, and so on. It cannot be defined in just one way, because there are many ways of understanding this term. For example, Jetsun Rinpoche, in his commentary on Hevajra, defines it as follows:

The Hevajra states:

Whatever arises connately
is called connate.
Called “connate by nature,”
all aspects are unified and one.

“If it is asked what entity is connate, that is called “connate by nature.” That being the case, there are two types of connate: example and meaning. If it is asked what is the meaning [connate], it means that ‘by nature’ has been so from the start, but is not produced dependently. If it is asked why that is the case, “All aspects are a single vow.” This means that when all phenomena are summarized, they are free from all proliferation.” 

But Saraha defines it:

Connate gnosis 
is the reality that one experiences. 

Aryadeva states:

Because the seed syllable A that is the door to all concentrations is nonarising, it is said to be the door to all phenomena, and is also called connate gnosis. 

Thus as per usual, there is no one size fits all for this term. It all depends on context.

Well, upadana means addictive, and the skandhas are addictive because they are afflicted, in the sequence klesha-+&gt;karma—&gt;dukkha. How ever you choose to parse those terms, that is the process of samsara.

For as long as one has not interrupted this cycle, there are the many dukkhas  of samsara. 

All afflicted/painful phenomena are suffering. The only compounded phenomena not included as suffering are path phenomena. You can read about thus in Vasubandhu, whose Abhidharma is more relevant to Mahayana than Abhidhamma.

Yes, but not the rig pa’i rtsal dbang. On the one hand, all word empowerments are direct introductions. One can consider it an introduction to trekcho, but this is not entirely accurate. It’s a foundation empowerment for the rig pa’i rtsal dbang. Empowerments ripen, but the instructions liberate. A characteristic of the rig pa’i rtsal dbang, and why they are crucial, is that they combine the ripening empowerment and liberating instruction together. The is a unique feature of Dzogchen empowerments.

It’s a beautiful cycle of teachings that has complete dzogchen teachings, which sadly are not given very frequently anymore. But maybe if you ask Garchen Rinpoche, he can teach you Rigzin Tsewang Norbu’s commentary on the creation stage and Kongtrul’s commentary on the completion stage.

This passage is not historical and it is not a legend, it is set in the far distant past beyond anything that remotely resembles the history of the universe as we presently understand it (cue remarks about going beyond concepts, etc.). 

Buddha was a historical person, but there are many legends about him, and the actual biography of the Buddha as a human being is still far from certain, but there are certain features of his biography to which all traditions assent, known as the twelve deeds. 

An example of a legend about the Buddha, an episode which exists only in the Chan tradition, concerns his holding up a flower, the meaning of which is only understood by Mahakashyapa. This is a didactic legend. It serves to underscore the fundamental point that the meaning of awakening cannot truly be encompassed in words. 

There are countless varieties of these legends and allegories in Buddhist texts. So, we, as modern clients of the Dharma, need to understand properly the distinction between myths, legends, and history in the Dharma. 

To recap a point made earlier, a story always begins, "I heard that...", and most Buddhist scriptures begin with evam maya śrutam ekasmin, "Thus at one time did I hear..."  There is no Buddhist sutra that is the direct words of the Buddha. All Buddhists sutras are related through a narrator, which we are expected to believe is Ananda. Thus all Buddhist sutras are second person narratives of events and conversations with persons for which we were not present. Then, of course, all Buddhist sutras are translations, reputedly from an oral record, set down in a local dialect, translated into Pali or Sanskrit, and then translated in to Tibetan and Chinese that no one can understand any more without extensive training, and English, French and so on. We have examples like the 17 Dzogchen tantras, whose framing myth asserts were all initially taught in birdsong during the first eon of this great eon, and only in this epoch were taught in the language of Oddiyana and then translated into Sanskrit--&gt;Tibetan, and so on. So we are always at best relying on fourth and fifth hand accounts. Just let that sink in.

Conventional truth and relative truth overlap, but are not entirely synonymous. The other planes of existence you refer to are things like hell realms. For example, Vasubandhu negates the existence of hell realms as physical places. Why? Because then hell guardians accrue untold negative karma. So they are not sentient beings and the hells do not really exist as physical places, even conventionally. 

The universe of Merus is the impure universe, not some exalted realm. It is the realm of the desire and form realm, i.e. samsara. But it is ridiculous to insist "Meru might be true in someone else's perception." Mt. Meru is really just the Tibetan plateau, etc. Four continents etc. are just Asia, Europe, Africa, etc. according to people who have no way of observing the earth from space.

For example, to a human, the perception of a liquid substance of the beings of the other six realms is false and deluded. Only the perception of water is correct and valid in the human realm. 

Likewise, in this day and age, the notion that the world is flat, the sky is blue because the southern face of Meru is made of sapphire, and Jambudvipa is surrounded by iron mountains to keep the stench of the proximate hells away is simply mythological and need not be taken as anything more than a pre-modern Buddhist view of the world, not even shared by Indian non-buddhists of the same era.

For me it is a matter of content. The teachings in the Pali canon are profound; certainly, the teachings in Mahāyāna sūtras are more profound. The teachings in Dzogchen tantras are the most profound, AFAIC. But I base this on content alone, and not authority of a historical figure. 

I think the myths and legends around these texts are important and must be preserved, but I don't think we have to take them as history, in the way some do.

It is controversial to describe them as the physically enunciated words of the Buddha. 

Even if we take my general attitude, which is just to call them buddhavacana and leave it at that, they still must be understood in context, audience, and so on. For example, there are many anachronisms in Mahāyāna sūtras which cannot be explained by asserting this or that text was actually enunciated by the Buddha. For example, why is the setting of the Lanka in Śṛī Lanka, and why is Ravana, the rakṣasa king, part of the main audience? 

One movement we see in Mahāyāna is moving sūtras, and later tantras, away from events in Jambudvipa and placing them in increasingly more abstract settings, such as on the peak of Meru (lower tantras) and so on. This is no where more pronounced than in Dzogchen tantras, which are not even set in this specific eon, for the most part. 

Buddhist sūtras are just stories. Even the Pali Canon and the Agamas barely resemble anything that can be construed as "historical." At the same time, western text critical narratives of them are just stories too, given how often scholars change their opinions about this thing and that. 

That people are offended, and lose "faith" is irrelevant. If the meaning of the teachings do not stand on their own without the Buddha, they still do not stand on their own with the Buddha.

The people who discuss the Lotus the most, online at any rate, are Nichiren Buddhists, and generally, without any context at all for understanding Mahāyāna. 

Your claims that the Lotus teaches a so-called buddhayāna which is somehow different than Mahāyāna bodhisattvayāna, is certainly not substantiated by the text itself. You sole argument for this rests  on the three cart metaphor. You have gotten the idea from somewhere that the adjective "great" somehow renders the gifted ox-carts better than the promised ox-cart among the three. But the sūtra states:

That is why they are called bodhisattva mahāsattvas.They are like the children in the parable who come out of the burning house because of their longing for an ox-drawn cart.

The Mahāyāna, the bodhisattvayāna, and the buddhayāna are all completely synonymous. What it this cart?

3.131: “The strengths, the dhyānas, and likewise the liberations,
And numerous millions of samādhis,
They are the most excellent cart,
Which the Buddha’s sons continually enjoy."

This clearly indicates that the much desired cart is the five strenths, the dhyānas, and the three liberations, etc., the standard features of the the Mahāyāna path. Called Buddha's heirs, this clearly refers to bodhisattva mahāsattvas. Their career is long, not short:

3.132: They spend nights enjoying it,
And days, half-months, and months,
And likewise years and intermediate eons.
They spend ten billion eons doing so.

And so on. It is extremely clear that the Buddha here is in these gathas is proclaiming Mahāyāna as the vehicle for buddhahood. What is the Mahāyāna? The path of bodhisattvas. The Buddha addresses Shariputra as follows:

3.134-136: Tiṣya, you should know this today:
You may search in all ten directions,
But there is no second yāna whatsoever
Other than as a skillful method of the superior beings.

“I am your father and you are my sons.
I have saved you from the suffering
Of being burned for many millions of eons
Within the terrifying three realms.

“I have thus taught you nirvāṇa.
You are freed from the suffering of saṃsāra,
But you have still not attained nirvāṇa.
You need to seek the yāna of buddhahood.

Here, the Buddha is addressing an arhat, telling him he must seek out the bodhisattva path. Why? Because śrāvakas typically believe there can only be one buddha at a time. 

When examined, who is being critiqued in the Lotus? Adherents of the Śrāvaka schools who assert that the desire to become a arhat, a pratyekabuddha, or a buddha are mutually exclusive. Indeed,  Śrāvaka schools normatively teach that if one decides to take the bodhisattva path, one can no longer become a stream entrant, and that one is delaying one's realization of the path of seeing until one's final lifetime as a bodhisattva. Mahāyāna texts from the PP Sūtras onward understand and extol the ekayāna teachings. Thus, it is very clear that the Lotus is supporting the idea that there is only one actual path, the path to buddhahood, and that path is the bodhisattva path, and whether aware of it or not, everyone is on this path. 

To sum up, I see no evidence to support your contention that the bodhisattva path mentioned is the Lotus is different from the buddhayāna, with one qualification. The Lotus can certainly be understood to be critiquing the śrāvaka notion that the three paths—srāvaka arhat, pratyekabuddha, and buddha—are mutually exclusive, and that choosing one is eschewing the other two. This is evident from a couple of facts: one, in the Lotus the Buddha predicts all sentient beings for full buddhahood; the srāvaka notion of an bodhisattva is that one must have been given a prediction during the lifetime of the Buddha to full buddhahood and that therefore, Mahāyānists who aspired for full buddhahood without said prediction were fools. Second, the Buddha, while not repudiating different inclinations for different results, repudiates that there are actually three seperate paths with three separate results, and further points out that the result sought by srāvakas—regardless of their inclination to realize the result of a srāvaka arhat, pratyekabuddha, or a buddha—is not merely the cessation from suffering. The Buddha in this text clarifies that nirvana is not merely the cessation of suffering:

3.142: Why do I say that this is not liberation?
Because this supreme, highest enlightenment is not attained.
I was born in this world in order to bring happiness.
That is the wish that I, the King of Dharma, have. 

Anuttarasamyaksaṃbodhi is attended by knowledge of all paths of liberation, among other things, which is I why I pointed out to you earlier that the PP Sūtras include the notion of omniscience about all paths of liberation, comparing and contrasting the inferior omniscience of srāvaka arhat and pratyekabuddha with the superior omniscience of bodhisattva mahāsattvas and ultimately, buddhahood. 

The third criteria that Hinayāna insists for a prediction to buddhahood and hence the ability to enter the bodhisattva path is that one must be male, and this is where the Nāga princess' story is relevant. 

I could go on, but you should get my drift. The bodhisattva yāna you think the Lotus is criticizing is not the Mahāyāna bodhisattva path, it is the bodhisattva path as it is taught in Hinayāna sūtras, Abhidharma, and so on.

The Lotus Sutra is a remarkable text based on its literary merits, for example, the parable of the prodigal son, etc., and all Mahayana traditions acknowledge this. But it’s not that special when considered from the point of view of the specifics of what we have come to understand as core Mahayana doctrine. 

The teleology and hermeneutics around it developed by Zhi Yi and his school is unique to the Sinosphere, but the emphasis on that obscures the sutra itself, in my opinion. 

We have access to sutras and shastras in a way that is unpraralleled before in any generation. We can quickly and easily search texts in Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan, and compare different translations into different languages and the phases of development of Buddhist thought around these texts. Because of this, everything in Buddhist thought and history is undergoing a thorough recontextualization. 

This should be embraced, not resisted.

There is a mistaken imputation of a self which is not real in any way at all. But the falsity of identity should be understood early on. When one achieves the first bodhisattva stage, one is free from the concepts of self and identity.

One cannot understand a text by ignoring its original milieu. What you are engaged in is special pleading 1) by deliberately down playing the Indian context of this text and 2) elevating its Chinese reception in one specific school. 

These texts were, in their stages of development, perfectly intelligible to Indian Buddhists who listened to and promulgated them. They needed no guidance in understanding the narratives they were presenting. 

The reason we do not find extensive presentations of the content of the Lotus in the synthetic commentaries such as those I have mentioned is that these commentaries are not going to focus on narratives, but rather on the key points related to the path.  

We know the Lotus was important to Indian Mahāyāna Buddhists, from its time of composition onward, because they cite it over and over again when discussing the principle of of ekayāna, irrespective of their orientation towards Madhyamaka or Yogacāra.  

We do not have many full fledged commentaries on Mahāyāna sūtras outside of the sūtras considered key to Madhyamaka or Yogacāra doctrines, like the PP Sūtras, the Lanka, the Saṃdhinirmocana, etc. The universal Indian Mahāyāna view concerning the ekayāna presented in the Lotus is that it, like other Mahāyāna sutras which bring up the issue, include all vehicles into one vehicle. That vehicle is the vehicle of buddhahood. The path that vehicle presents is the bodhisattva path. Otherwise, one cannot find in any sūtra, or tantra for that matter, the notion of a "fourth" vehicle, or the idea that there is a separate "buddha path" which is distinct from Mahāyāna. One does find this equation: ekayāna = mahāyāna = buddhayāna. One also finds the idea, in both sūtras and Indian treatises that cite them, that the śrāvakayāna and pratyekabuddhayāna are included in Mahāyāna, making one vehicle.   

The bodhisattvas welling up from the ground is a distraction. As a narrative it serves no purpose in the discussion of ekayāna. It is related to another issue, "When did the Buddha attain buddhahood? And the answer to that question, everyone in Mahāyāna agrees, is gazillions of eons ago. Whether Maitreya was truly astonished, or merely expressing astonishment as a show, is irrelevant. The point of the story is why the Buddha was able to teach so many bodhisattvas, setting the stage for his grand reveal.

Not at all:

saddharmapuṇḍarīka-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra

Do you think the Mahāyāna is something other than the bodhisattva path? This is the path being described as the ekayāna. 

Other than the Lotus, the ekayāna is mentioned in:

The PP in 18 Thousand lines
PP in 8 Thousand lines
The Lankavatāra  (one of the more extensive presentations aside from the lotus)
Shrimāladevi Sūtra  (one of the more extensive presentations aside from the lotus)
The Great Drum Sūtra
The AngulimālaSūtra
The Nirvana Sūtra (one of the more extensive presentations aside from the lotus)
The Samdhinirmocana Sūtra.
The Dharani that Removes obscurations
The Great Liberation Sūtra (one of the more extensive presentations aside from the lotus)
The Ten Wheels of Kṣitigarbha Sūtra
The King of The Sublime Dharma Sūtra
Cloud of Jewels Sūtra
Differentiation of Phenomena and Meaning Sūtra
The Skill in Means Sūtra (one of the more extensive presentations aside from the lotus)
The Vajrasamadhi Sūtra (apocryphal, but important). 
Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra
The Request of Akṣayamati Sūtra
Sūtra that Shows Donning the Armor
The Method that is the Domain of Bodhisattvas Sūtra (one of the more extensive presentations aside from the lotus)
The Intimate Instruction of Mahāyāna Sutra. 

Here, in all these sūtras, we see that the concept of the ekayāna is very consistent applied and is completely synonymous with Mahāyāna and the path of the bodhisattva.

Chapter 5 states it well:

“ ‘The one who knows that phenomena
Have the nature of dreams and illusions,
Are without an essence like a plantain tree
And are the same as echoes, {79}

“ ‘That one knows the nature
Of the entire three realms,
Has no bondage, is liberated,
And knows nirvāṇa. {80}

“ ‘All phenomena are empty and equal,
And their nature is without diversity or differentiation.
If that is not perceived,
There is no insight into any phenomenon. {81}

“ ‘The one with great wisdom sees
The entire dharmakāya.
There are no three yānas at all;
There is only the single yāna. {82}

“ ‘All phenomena are the same;
All are the same, always the same.
Knowing that, one knows
Nirvāṇa, deathlessness, and peace.’ ”



Chapter 13 also has a pretty good summary:

“When the stable ones do not entertain the notion of ‘woman,’
And do not have the concept of ‘man,’
Then, because all phenomena are unborn,
Upon seeking them they do not see them. {17}

“This practice that I have described
Is completely that of the bodhisattvas.
Listen to the explanation
Of that which is their field of activity. {18}

“These phenomena are declared nonexistent;
They are all unproduced and unborn.
They remain empty and motionless at all times:
That is what is called the field of activity of the wise. {19}

“Being and not being, existing and not existing:
These are fabrications of erroneous conceptualization.
Unborn phenomena that are also unoriginated
Are misconstrued to be born and existing. {20}

“With a one-pointed mind, always in meditation,
As completely stable as Mount Sumeru,
Stable in this way, they should view
All these phenomena as being like space. {21}

“They are always the same as space, without an essence,
Motionless and devoid of illusory thoughts.
This is the way phenomena are throughout time.
This is what is called the field of activity of the wise.

What the Lotus is critiquing is the notion of three gotras: śrāvaka arhats; pratyekabuddhas, and buddhas. 

Of course, also the Lanka has the same critique. 

The Abhisamayalaṃkāra distinguishes the these three on the basis of what kind of all-knowledge each of the three possesses, because they are different. The reason it does so is that on the path, the bodhisattva must possess and surpass the all-knowledge of śrāvaka arhats and pratyekabuddhas, which they do by the tenth bhumi.

The problem with sutras in general is that they are not systematic. Abhidharma and tenet system are intended to put into a useable order the raw material of sutras, and this is true of the whole tradition of writing commentaries on sutras and tantras in all Mahayana countries. 

Nevertheless, some sutras are more systematic then others. 

Further, the whole attempt to define sutras by periods of the Buddha’s life, whether three turnings or five periods, are faulty criteria for evaluating the relative merits of this or that sutra, and mainly serve scholastic objectives.

The least convincing criteria for a practice is personal testimonials.

Correct. I am not evaluating this text based on how it was received and understood in China by the Tientai school. I am evaluating this text based on how it is cited and understood in India. 

In general, based on the sheer number of Indian commentaries for it, the Perfection of Wisdom group of sutras is by far the most important group of sutras in India. Not only are there more commentaries on them, but the Perfection of Wisdom sutras are by far the largest group.

Further, you will find it said in the tantras that the only effective practice in this day and age is Vajrayana practice. 

So, as usual, it all depends on who you are inclined to believe.

Title: Re: Dharmakaya Body View

According to Maitreya and Asanga:

[Asanga explains:]
If it is asked what the dharmakāya, [Maitreya states]:

The dharmakāya has two aspects:
the very pure dharmadhātu
and that explication of the methods
and the variety that corresponds with that cause.

[Asanga explains:] The dharmakāya of the buddha is understood in two aspects. The very pure dharmadhātu is the domain that is the experiential domain of nonconceptuality. That is understood as the dharma the tathāgatas know personally. The cause of obtaining that is the corresponding cause, the very pure dharmadhātu, which is perceived in sentient beings according to how they are to be tamed. 

Further, that is known from the perspective of the dharma to be explained. Also the explanation has two aspects, divided into subtle and vast dharmas. This is as follows: from the perspective of ultimate truth, the bodhisattva piṭaka explicates the method of presenting the profound dharma. From the perspective of relative truth, there are methods of presenting many varieties of [teachings] such as the sūtras, praises, predictions, verses, the sayings, and nidanas, and so on. 

 [Maitreya states]:
Beyond the world, but in the world—
because the example for this cannot be indicated,
the tathāgata itself and the element
are explained to be similar. 
The subtle and profound method of explaining
is like the one taste of honey.
The way of explaining diverse aspects
is like the heart of different bodies.

[Asanga explains:] As such, the three examples of the buddha statue, honey, and the heart, from the perspective of the meaning of the dharmakāya of the tathāgata pervading all sentient beings, these sentient beings are called "possessors of the essence of the tathāgata." That sentient being who exists outside the dharmakāya of the tathāgatas does not exist in the realm of sentient beings at all. 

The element of space is like matter. How? It is said:

Just as the element of space is held to always goes everywhere, 
likewise, that [dharmakāya] always goes everywhere. 
Just as space goes into all matter,
likewise, that goes into the multitude of sentient beings. 


Then you must ask, what is the dharmadhātu?

 [Maitreya states]:
Because the dharmadhātu is 
naturally pure, it is luminosity. 

Then you must ask, what is luminosity? 

The answer:

[Asanga explains:] Because that mind is luminous by original nature, it is seen that afflictions are natureless. 

So, the luminosity of the mind is the dharmadhātu, the realization of the dharmadhātu is the dharmakāya.

And to sum it up, the Perfection of Wisdom states:

There is no mind in the mind, but the original nature of the mind is luminous.

I understand you believe that everything the Buddha taught comes from the Lotus Sutra. But I do not find support for that position in the text you’ve cited. See section 10.31 in the 84000 version. There is no mention of all bodhisattvas attaining buddhahood based on this sūtra.  Just to be clear, I do not have doubt, surprise, or fear of what the Buddha taught in the Lotus Sutra. The Buddha’s Dharma is a many faceted gem. The Lotus is one of those facets, but it is only a facet, not the whole gem, not for me. YMMV.

All this section says is:

"It is because this Dharma teaching is the supreme elucidation of the teachings that have an implied meaning of the secret aspect of the Dharma taught by the tathāgatas, arhats, perfectly enlightened buddhas so that the bodhisattva mahāsattvas may attain complete accomplishment."

In other words, in this sūtra, the implied meaning that is revealed is the ekayāna. That's it. This is how it is understood by Maitrya, Śantideva, and other great Indian masters, who are the ones in whom I place my faith when it comes to accurately portraying the meaning of Mahāyāna Dharma. 

Moreover, in my tradition, there is a text called the Tantra of the Sole Heir of All Buddhas. This text arises as the sound of dharmatā, the very sound of reality itself, which is self-originated; and it is the text, according to my tradition, that is explicitly responsible for buddhahood of all buddhas. All Dharma teachings come from this tantra alone. I don't expect you to believe this, but this is what this text states.

No. I think karma is caused by affliction (kleśa) and results (vipāka) in suffering (dukkha). 

BTW, there is no daylight between how affliction, karma, and suffering are presented in Mahāyāna sūtras and Śrāvakayāna sūtras. For example, Nāgārjuna's Commentary on his Heart of Dependent Origination:


Question: Which links are affliction, which are action karma, and which are suffering? Into which of these twelve will [affliction, action, and suffering] be included?

Reply: 

The first, eighth and ninth links are affliction.

The first of the twelve links is ignorance (āvidya); the eighth link is craving (ṭṛṣṇā); the ninth link is addiction, (upādana). These three should be understood as affliction. If is asked which of those [twelve links] is action: 

The second and the tenth links are action. 

The second link is formations (saṃskāra) and the tenth link is existence (bhāva). These two dharmas can be understood to be included in action. 

Also, the remaining seven links are suffering.

Question: Those different [previous dharmas] were included in defilement and action, but which are the seven different remaining? 

Reply: Those can be understood to be included in suffering. These terms consciousness (vijñāna), name and form (nāmarūpa), six sense bases (ṣada-āyatana), contact, (sparśa), sensation (vedana), birth (jati), and aging and death (jarāmaraṇa) are inclusive of the sufferings such as the suffering of being separated from what is pleasant, meeting with what is unpleasant, and abandonment of the pleasurable. 


So you see, the ultimate cause of suffering is affliction, not karma. Affliction causes karma, which then results in suffering. You are not going to find in the sūtras, whether Mahāyāna or Śrāvakayāna, any explanation that diverges from this.

Minobu:

Actually, the cause of karma is affliction, desire, hatred, and ignorance. Desire, hatred, ignorance are the cause of most illnesses, because desire, hatred, and ignorance manifest in the body as "wind" (vāta), "bile" (pitta), and "phlegm" (kapha). 

Now the one place you do have it right, is that the SUFFERING (a result) of illnesses is karmic, since karma ripens as neutral, painful or pleasant sensations. But the CAUSE of illness is the three humors. And the cause of the three humors is the three poisons. Karma does not cause the three poisons, the three poisons cause negative karma.

Karmic illnesses are illnesses that are a result, such as congenital blindness, and other incurable diseases. Curable diseases are not caused by karma. That is the distinction between humoral illnesses and karmic illnesses. There are also illnesses caused by spirits, and those attacks are general caused by engaging in nonvirtuous acts in temples, etc.

Huh? Mind streams never go extinct. 

Have you considered the idea that you may have some unresolved attachment to physicalist views on the emergence of consciousness?

This is why I keep insisting on two factors: one, consciousness cannot be created and sentient beings are self-organized phenomena in toto. In order for a machine to be sentient, it would have to be possibly birth locus, a place where a being in the intermediate state would attempt to appropriate as a new series of aggregates. 

AI does not satisfy criteria one, because machines are wholly fabricated devices, and do not exhibit self-organizing behavior. They can emulate that kind of behavior, but it is not true autopoiesis. They do not satisfy two, because there is simply no evidence that consciousness can appropriate a machine as a place of rebirth. Even if a consciousness could appropriate a machine as a place of rebirth, this still would not render machines —artificially— intelligent, and that consciousness would NOT be an emergent property at all. 

Indeed, the only way I can imagine personally, an intelligent machine, is that someone might experience this as a personal hell, similar to stories where people are reborn in pillars, brooms, and so on.

The main deity is Vajravārāhī, she is the main deity that is generated. All you have to do is check the Mka’ ‘gro lnga’i mchod pa’i phrin las kyi rim pa shes bya ba, and you will see this is so. Her description is first, as would normally be the case with the male principle, and Hayagriva's is second. Her description is comparatively detailed, his is a mere four lines. This is not from that text precisely, being from the later Tennyi Lingpa yang gter, but it is substantially the same:

གདན་སྟེང་ཡི་གེ་ཧྲཱིཿམའི་འཕྲོ་འདུ་ལས༔ གྲི་གུག་ཐོད་པ་འོད་དུ་ཞུ་བ་ལས༔ བདག་ཉིད་རྡོ་རྗེ་ཕག་མོ་སྐུ་མདོག་དམར༔ ཞལ་གཅིག་ཕྱག་གཉིས་ཞབས་གཉིས་བརྐྱང་བསྐུམ་མཛད༔ ཁྲོ་ཞལ་དམར་པོ་སྤྱན་གསུམ་མཆེ་བ་གཙིགས༔ དབུ་སྐྲ་སེར་པོ་མེ་ལོང་དྲིལ་བུས་བརྒྱན༔ སྤྱི་གཙུག་ཕག་ཞལ་ནག་མོ་ངུར་སྒྲ་སྒྲོག༔ ཕྱག་གཡས་གྲི་གུག་གཡོན་པས་ཐོད་པ་བསྣམས༔ མཆན་ཁུང་གཡོན་དུ་ཁ་ཊྭཱཾ་ཌཱ་རུ་འཛིན༔ རུས་པའི་རྒྱན་དྲུག་སྐུ་ལ་མཛེས་པར་བརྒྱན༔ མེ་རི་འབར་བའི་ཀློང་ན་འགྱིང་བག་བཞུགས༔ དཔའ་བོ་རྟ་མགྲིན་དམར་པོ་གར་སྟབས་མཛད༔ དབུ་གཙུག་རྟ་མགོ་ལྗང་གུ་རྟ་སྐད་འཚེར༔ ཕྱག་གཡས་གྲི་གུག་གཡོན་པས་ཐོད་པ་བསྣམས༔ དུར་ཁྲོད་ཆས་ཀྱིས་དཔའ་བོའི་སྐུ་ལ་བརྒྱན༔

I have seen thankas of this, but they are not available in public.

In the end it does not matter much, since both forms are present in the KN/KY, that is Hayagriva as the principle, and Vārāhī as the principle.

Another problem with your hypothesis is that the Buddha defined the number of sentient beings to be finite, uncountable, but finite.

The klong gsal 'bar ma nyi ma is definitely the text the KN is based; Dorje's Lingpa's extension of it is clearly later. 

For example, the klong gsal in 112 chapters is commonly cited as a proof texts for inner rushan, etc. 

This is also not Ratna Lingpa's later text, since citations from the "klong gsal" are found in the long tantra in 112 chapters. It is also not the same as the one revealed by Rin chen gling pa found in the Derge rNying ma rgyud 'bum.

The first 25 chapters of the 112 chapter klong gsal are short versifications of the Rang shar's first 25 chapters, more or less. 

So, if it is not Nyangral's, then its origin is still anonymous for now.

I am afraid that this question can only be answered definitively by someone who has the higher cognitive ability (abhijñā) to know the minds of others. However, Buddha denied sentience in plants very clearly. Thus, just as we deny sentience in plants, etc., the Buddhist position will be that machines cannot be sentient. Suffering requires karma and affliction as causes. Sentience requires self-organized replication and continuation. Machines will never achieve this, since they have never been self-organized entities, but created entities. We sentient beings are not created, our mind streams are beginningless.  There has never been a moment in time when our mind streams did not exist. Now, is it possible some unfortunate preta could inhabit a machine? I guess so. A deva or an asura would not bother, because other than the most pure bhikṣus and bhikṣunīs, we humans smell very nauseating to them, like a rotting pit of offal. Possession is not rebirth thought, since there is no gradual development from conception, and in fact, apparitional births like hell beings, bardo beings, pretas, and devas, are basically mind-made bodies supported by the air element. Recall, there are four kinds of birth, not a fifth.

In the Gongpa Zangthal Vārāhī practice, and a very similar sadhana composed by Longchenpa in the Khandro Yangthig, yes, Vārāhī is the main deity, and Hayagriva is the consort, not the other way around. Another sadhana with this format is Khentse Wangpo's Chime Phagma Nyinthig, where White Tāra is the main deity, embraced by Avalokiteśvara as Narteśvara, Lord of the Dance (some say this is Amitabha, but that does not really make sense), lord of the dance.

All I know is that Longchenpa has a sadhana he composed in the KY, which features Vajravārāhī with Hayagriva as her consort. The same arrangement is presented in the GZ. 

The mantras are all the same, check the mkha' 'gro sngags kyi lde migs in GZ, v. one, 364-365, KN, vol.2 331-332; as well as the mkha' 'gro gsang sgrub dngos grub gter gyi 'bum pa, GZ vol. 365-371, KN, vol.1 321-328. They are identical texts. Pretty sure there are a couple of more that are identical which must come from the KN; aside from the six liberation through wearing tantras in vol 2 of the GZ and vol. 2 of the KN. This means these texts were inserted into the GZ at some point, and whether it was by Godem himself or some later compiler, I don't know. Not only this, but the main four empowerment texts for the GZ in vol. 1 very much resemble Longchenpa's empowerment for the KN/KY. This does not mean that Godem was influenced by Longchenpa, but at minimum it means that there is a common source.

Given that the KN is a self-described commentary on the klong gsal nyi ma 'bar ma, you might wish to do a little more heavy lifting and identify where those passages are located.

Also the Vajravārāhī sadhana is clearly linked with Longchenpa's version in the KY, since the consort is Hayagriva, rather than the other way around, as in the KN.

All sentient beings have, at minimum, a mental organ and a jivitendriya, an organ of life. 

But more importantly, sentience self-organizes. No one created our mindstreams. In order for a machine to be sentient, a sentient being would have to be conceived as a machine. Among the four kinds of birth, which kind of birth would this be? 

Finally, the Buddha taught three kinds of suffering—the suffering of suffering, the suffering of change, and the suffering of the compounded. The last of these is not restricted to sentient beings and applies to all compounded, afflictive phenomena (everything other than path dharmas). 

In this case, Metzinger's definition of suffering as a experience is too limited. By the criteria of the third kind of suffering, machines already suffer. My comment was directed to the idea that machines can experience suffering. But suffering is not only an experience in a consciousness, it is also an existential fact about impermanent phenomena.

There is no space father or mother, no rules, and no afterlife in which to receive a reward. The next life is not an "afterlife," it is the next life after this one, hopefully as a human being able to meet and practice the dharma.

In other words, if buddhahood arises from causes and conditions, it would be compounded and impermanent. One could realize buddhahood, and then when the conditions for buddhahood ceased, one's realization would vanish.

This primacy of the Buddha can be well understood through the metaphor of the sun and its light. 

The Buddha is the sun. The Dharma is its light. However, while we cannot always see the light of the sun, the sun is always there. 

Without the light shed by the sun, of course, those in ignorance cannot see things the way they are, and they stumble around in darkness. But the light of the sun depends on proper conditions to illuminate the world, even though the sun is always there, whether it is day or night. 

This is why the Buddha has primacy. Without the sun of the Buddha rising in the sky, his light does not shine on the world. And due to the misfortune of sentient beings, the sun of the Buddha will also set, even though the Buddha never moves from his place, and does not rise or set.

I doubt it is a sexist addition; it most certainly is a sexist sentiment.

As for tossing the whole sūtra out merely because it says some things that really must be taken with a grain of salt, no, that is not what I am implying. 

Suppose the sūtra said, "Those who understand tathāgatagarbha are White, while those who do not understand tathāgatagarbha are Black. Now, if you are Black but you understand tathāgatagarbha, you are White; and if you are White and you do not understand tathāgatagarbha, you are Black."

Suppose the sūtra said, "Those who understand tathāgatagarbha are Eastern, while those who do not understand tathāgatagarbha are Western. Now, if you are Western but you understand tathāgatagarbha, you are Eastern; and if you are Eastern and you do not understand tathāgatagarbha, you are Western."

It is just a poorly thought out sentiment only possible in a patriarchal context where men are in a superior position (i.e. all of history).

In this case, the Goddess of the Ganges has it right.

In general, it should be considered provisional even by Longchenpa since it contains the doctrine of the icchantika. It is also considered provisional because it uses intentional language to discuss a self, permanence, and so on.  

What Longchenpa holds to be definitive is the doctrine of tathāgatagarbha, but there are some problems if we take the whole of those ten sūtras to be "definitive." 

Then of course, there is the issue of whether the tathāgatagarbha doctrine is actually definitive. Arguably, the Uttaratantra itself holds the tathāgatagarbha doctrine to be provisional.

Content:
I am pretty sure Vimalamkīrti beat Nichiren to the punch:

Thereupon, magically influenced by the Buddha, the venerable Śāriputra
had this thought: “If the buddhafield is pure only to the extent that the mind
of the bodhisattva is pure, [F.180.b] then, when Śākyamuni Buddha was
engaged in the career of the bodhisattva, his mind must have been impure.
Otherwise, how could this buddhafield appear to be so impure?”

The Buddha, aware of venerable Śāriputra’s thoughts, said to him, “What
do you think, Śāriputra? Is it because the sun and moon are impure that
those blind from birth do not see them?”

Śāriputra replied, “No, Lord. It is not so. The fault lies with those blind
from birth, and not with the sun and moon.”

The Buddha declared, “In the same way, Śāriputra, the fact that some
living beings do not behold the splendid display of virtues of the
buddhafield of the Tathāgata is due to their own ignorance. It is not the fault
of the Tathāgata. Śāriputra, the buddhafield of the Tathāgata is pure, but you
do not see it.”

Then, the Brahmā Śikhin said to the venerable Śāriputra, “Reverend
Śāriputra, do not say that the buddhafield of the Tathāgata is impure.
Reverend Śāriputra, the buddhafield of the Tathāgata is pure. I see the
splendid expanse of the buddhafield of the Lord Śākyamuni as equal to the
splendor of, for example, the abodes of the highest deities.”

Then the venerable Śāriputra said to the Brahmā Śikhin, “As for me, O
Brahmā, I see this great earth, with its highs and lows, its thorns, its
precipices, its peaks, and its abysses, as if it were entirely filled with ordure.”
Brahmā Śikhin replied, “The fact that you see such a buddhafield as this as
if it were so impure, reverend Śāriputra, is a sure sign that there are highs
and lows in your mind and that your positive thought in regard to the
buddha-gnosis is not pure either. Reverend Śāriputra, those whose minds
are impartial toward all living beings and whose positive thoughts toward
the buddha-gnosis are pure see this buddhafield as perfectly pure.” [F.181.a]

Thereupon the Lord touched the ground of this billion-world galactic
universe with his big toe, and suddenly it was transformed into a huge mass
of precious jewels, a magnificent array of many hundreds of thousands of
clusters of precious gems, until it resembled the universe of the Tathāgata
Ratnavyūha, called Ananta guṇa ratna vyūha. Everyone in the entire assembly
was filled with wonder, each perceiving himself seated on a throne of
jeweled lotuses.

In many respects it reads like a text book (which it is), and is not the most thrilling writing ever, but each chapter has an extensive bibliography, and authors take pain not to retread old material, but focus on the social dimension of Japanese Buddhist history, its not a book about the various schools as much as it is a book about how Japanese society and Buddhism evolved together from the beginnings of Buddhism's introduction by Korean merchants, and so on.

I will add, that one thing of interest to me is the parallel developments of Buddhism on opposite ends of Asia, in Tibet and Japan (While I was never interested in Chinese or Korean Buddhism per se, I was interested in Japanese Buddhism first, and then later, Tibetan Buddhism.)

Japan's economy and society was not notably disrupted by the Great Buddhist Purge of 845 in China, which threw all of mainland Asia into social and economic disarray. While Buddhism was present in Tibet in some form or another since roughly the 5th century CE, when a copy of the Karandavyhua was supposedly presented to King Lhato Thori(27th king of Tibet), and Tibetans were certainly aware of Buddhism since they regularly sacked Khotan (there is a whole sūtra about this), Buddhism did not begin to be formally established until the 7th century, during the reign of King Songtsan Gampo (?-649, he was reputed to have lived 82 years, but info is sketchy, his reign was from 629-649). So given the implied dates of his life span, he was a contemporary of Shotoku.

Interestingly enough, it is quite likely that this planted to the seed of the Avalokiteśvara Devotion in Tibet.

Generally, the order actually given in the sūtras is as follows, for example, in the Ugraparipṛcchā, Ratnarāśi, etc.: "Rely on the meaning, not on the syllables; rely on gnosis (jñāna), not on consciousness (vijñāna); rely on the dharma, not on the person; rely on sūtras of definitive meaning, not on sūtras of provisional meaning."

Then of course this leave open the question, "what is a definitive sūtra?" The Buddha defines this in many ways. For example, in the Bodhisattvapiṭaka he defines a definitive sūtra as one that explains the meaning comprehensively and that introduces the result. Repeating those criteria, the Aksayamati Sūtra expands the list by pointing out that provisional sūtras teach on self, persons, living beings, etc.; those sūtras that teach emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness, nonfabrication, nonorigination, nonproduction, absence of entities, selflessness, and so on are definitive. The Anavataptanāgarāja Sutra teachings us that sūtras which teach dependent origination are definitive sūtras, because that which arises in dependence is selfless, etc. 

Thus, there are many definitive sūtras, not only one or two.

Mulasarvastivadin (The rules of Vinaya are the same in ALL Tibetan schools) and is based on OTD's statement in Tibetan, not English.

"Bar ma rab 'byung" (*madhyapravrajita) is a Tibetan invention, common in all Tibetan monastic institutes, but still a Tibetan idea. You will not find that term in Vinaya itself.

There are only eight kinds of pratimokṣa vows: upāsaka, upavasa, śramanera, bhikṣu + their equivalents for women. The śikṣamāṇā probationary period for women is not really considered a separate vow. Also, there is no celibate upāsaka vow in Mulasarvastivada.

It should be noted that he made this announcement in January 2019, the month he allegedly ended contact with Vikki Hui Xin Han, which lead to her lawsuit filed in June 2019.

The 13th century marked the beginning of institutional consolidation. But there were a number of populist trends in Tibet at the time, and yes, they were largely merged into modern Nyingma—&nbsp;especially the rise of the cult of Padmasambhava and the treasure tradition and the emphasis on Avalokiteśvara as the national savior.

Well, Vajrayāna tends to create brahmins where there are none, for example Tibetan "ngakpas," especially when it comes to the earlier tantras, like those that spread to China and thence to Japan. 

One of the attractive features of Indian Vajrayāna is that it took rituals like homavidhi, burnt offerings, away from brahmins and recontextualized them for Buddhists. For example, Anandagarbha has a whole argument detailing why Buddhist homavidhi is superior to Brahmin homavidhi.

However, Japan, unlike Tibet, was a highly organized society where central authorities were much more present in daily life. With Tibet, you had nomads, bandits, and people pretty much doing as they pleased in areas outside of immediate urban centers and great monastic institutions. 

In this sort of Japanese environment, it is easy to see how Buddhism became stratified, and why, in the 13th century, populist forms of Buddhism arose. Actually, my read of Dogen, based on recent reading, was that he was engaged in an idiosyncratic pushback against the populism that exemplified Pure Land and Nichiren, as well as a reform movement aimed at introducing 13th century, Chinese style monastic Chan Buddhism into Japan. 

In Tibet, exactly the opposite was happening—there was major institutional pushback against Buddhist populism, especially against the treasure tradition. Also, Mongols were invading... (Dogen also took credit for repelling the Mongols, BTW.)

Inaccurate is inaccurate. 

In order to have an accurate translation, one would need to have Kumarajiva's original (since his recension has been subject to anonymous editing),   The Tibetan, which was made from an 8th century Sanskrit version, and a Nepalese copy, plus any readings found in the Sutrasammucaya, etc. Otherwise, what one ends up with is misunderstanding piled on mistranslations piled on misreadings.

Illarazza's idea that the Buddha specially blessed Kumarajiva's mind to produce a translation that is the real intent of the sūtra is like the idea of fundamentalist Christians that the translation group that produced the King James Bible was anointed by God to their task. In other words, complete hooey.

My aspirations have been fulfilled
And I teach enlightenment and buddhahood."

One is called the "door mantra." The idea is that anyone who walks under it will have a lot of karma purified.

The second one is called the Six Spaces of Samantabhadra and comes from the 17 Dzogchen Tantras. It is the form of the six buddhas of the six realms in the form of syllables. Thus, seeing it creates a positive cause for meeting the path in this life or another.

It’s the difference between what is termed natural gotra and activated gotra. All sentient beings have the former, only those who have taken the bodhisattva vow have the latter. I suspect this Yogacara idea is behind the distinction being made here, notion one does not have Buddhanature until you hear the teachings. I suspect much is being lost in translation, and as far as I know there is very little serious work on Nichiren Buddhism by academic scholars outside of Japan.

The fact is that a lot of SF does not age well. Most of it is poorly written drivel. 

But there are standouts, like Phillip K. Dick, who seems to be the richest single source for SF movies going.

Le Guin is good, but uneven. Margret Atwood, of course, is a great writer.

Direct introduction, or as it is more accurately translated, “directly encounter one's own state,” is a method where the teacher assists the student in recognizing a moment of unmodified, pellucid, consciousness through explanation, symbols, and resting together in the state the student is to encounter.  

Using various methods, the student then engages in various practices to encounter their own state until they have decided upon it, decide one thing, or as CHNN puts, remain without doubt.

Then one continues in that state, or literally, continue in the confidence of liberation, meaning one is now a real dzogchen practitioner.

However, there are no stages in dzogchen.

Not really. When one sees multiple tulkus of one person, its usually because different lineage heads of different monasteries recognize a tulku of that person. It is not an organized institution with the central clearing house of incarnations.
