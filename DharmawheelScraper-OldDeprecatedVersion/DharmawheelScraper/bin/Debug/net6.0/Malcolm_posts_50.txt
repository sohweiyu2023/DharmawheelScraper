In your opinion. Others vigorously disagree with your assertion, as do the vast majority of Mahāyāna sutras. How the tathāgatagarbha sutras (a very minor part of the Mahāyāna canon) are to be read is a bit of a contentious issue -- suffice it to say that the commentary on them reads like a standard Madhyamaka text.

The teaching of the Buddha is just dependent origination, not self, not no-self. 

Sariputra quotes the Buddha:

Whoever sees dependent co-arising sees the Dhamma; whoever sees the Dhamma sees dependent co-arising.
http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka ... .than.html

And the Buddha said:

He who sees Dhamma, Vakkali, sees me; he who sees me sees Dhamma. Truly seeing Dhamma, one sees me; seeing me one sees Dhamma.

http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka ... .wlsh.html

Emptiness of a self as well as the absence of intrinsic identity in phenomena, is merely a consequence of dependent origination. 

It is very clear, for example, that the tathāgatagarbha doctrine was swiftly marginalized in mainstream Mahāyāna circles. We can see this by virtue of the fact that the Lankāvatara sūtra clearly describes the ālayavijñāna as being the tathāgatagarbha. There exists but two commentaries devoted to tathāgatgarbha doctrine in the bstan 'gyur. 

In general, tathāgatagarbha doctrine becomes more prominent in Vajrayāna for various reasons beyond the scope.

Hi Ardent:

Isn't boring to rehash arguments we had on AOL?

Vasubandhu (cf. Poussin/Pruden) quotes several sources from the Agamas having stated his thesis at the outset:

"There is neither direct perception nor inference of a soul (atman) independent of the skandhas. We know then that a real soul does not exist."

He then cites his authorities such as the Bimbisāra sūtra:

"A stupid ignorant Pṛthagjana becomes attached to words, and he imagines there is a self; but there is no self nor things pertaining to a self, but only past, present and future painful dharmas". 

He cites another, also cited in the Sūtrālaṃkara:

"Five calamities proceed from the belief in a soul(atman): one creates a theory of a soul, of a being, of a vital principle, one is not distinguished from heterodox teachers...: etc. 

Even the tathāgatagarbha sūtras take great pains to differentiate their "atman" from the atman posited by Pudgalavadins and Hindus because the tatāgatagarbha is merely a gloss for dharmatā. 

For example, Ārya-tathāgatagarbha-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

Whether or not that dharmatā of dharmas produces tathāgatas, these sentient beings always contain tathāgatagarbha. 

Now, depending on what you understand dharmatā to mean, then you will understand this in that light. But since there can be no dharmatā without dharmas, it is ludicrous to say this if this tathagātagarbha is other than the aggregates it is also the nature of the aggregates. 

Personally, my impression of the main message of the tathagatagarbha sutras is that people should not feel awakening is beyond their capacity. For example, is how this passage from the Tathāgatagarbha sūtra reads:

"Sons of a good family, in the same way all sentient beings are without protection, are tormented with the sufferings of samsara, abiding in a house without a protector, the place of birth in the world. Now, the family of tathagatas exists in all sentient beings, but those it exists in them, those sentient being do not comprehend this. 

Suns of a good family, because the Tathāgata do not malign sentient being themselves, sons of good family, you yourselves must not be disheartened, and have firm diligence! There will come a time when the Tathāgata enters into you and you will enter into the ranks of the bodhisattvas and will not be called "sentient beings". Further, when you have entered the ranks of the buddhas, you will not be called "bodhisattvas". 

And:

It was taught, "Sentient beings who do not understand dharmatā, 
do not generate the thought of 'I am inferior'!"
You must set out with firm diligence, 
your own body will become a victor without long delay. 
Once one has obtained the heart of awakening, 
one will be able to liberate 10,000,000,000 creatures.

I didn't say that Samkhya was a major influence of Buddhism, did I? No. 

What I said was that Buddha was aware, indeed, knowledgable in Samkhya since it was the system taught by Arāda. 

Aśvaghoṣa clearly describes Arāda as being a follower of Kaplila, and gives an account of the basics of the Samkhya system in Canto 12 (truly required reading for everyone participating in this discussion). 

So, frankly, I think Aśvaghoṣa is a more reliable source than Pande, don't you, Ardent?

Regarding Phae Tissadevo's position:

The anattā doctrine is only founding in Buddhism because the Buddha realised attā that is different from conditioned dhammas.

It is pretty clear this Sangharāja never studied Samkhya since in fact that is exactly what the Samkhya/Yoga schools maintains, that self or purusha is completely other than consciousness, senses, sense objects and the material body i.e. the twenty four tattvas (prakṛti, buddhi, ahaṃkara, manas, the five organs, five organs of action, the five subtle elements [tanmatras] and the five gross elements).

If an atman is what one wants to find, then there is no better system of finding it than Samkhya/Yoga.

Of course, Buddha was quite familiar with Samkhya, but for some reason did not present it in his teachings.

If you are a practitioner of completion stage practices, one Dzogchen manual  advises against receiving moxabustion or bloodletting treatments (including acupuncture needles). Tattoos are a form of bloodletting. So, if you are a serious completion stage practitioner, then I would say it is better not to get tattoos. If you are not a completion stage practitioner, then just make sure the tattoo artist is hygienic. It is better if they also are a Dharma person. 

Further, do not get tattoos of Dharma themes below the waist, on one's left hand (since that is the one most people in Asia wipe with) and so on.

No, if that were the case, Dzogchen would be no different than Samkhya. A useful referent is the Sakya concept that lhun grub and gnas 'gyur, natural formation and transformation, are not mutually exclusive. Potentiality can be just as well explained through emptiness as it can existence, even more easily actually. In general, there is a discussion of the three kāyas of the basis i.e. emptiness, clarity and their inseparability. Because these are present as the basis, the three kāyas can manifest at the time of the result, since their base exists in the basis. But this does not mean that the three kāyas of the basis are identical with the three kāyas of the result. The basis is called the basis precisely because of nonrealization.

It is both, and the former will lead to the latter, which is why Āryadeva proclaimed "Realization proceeds from view." This is why there is such a huge emphasis on developing a correct view in sūtrayāna. Whereas in Vajrayāna in general, the view is taught only after empowerment, because the view cultivated in Vajrayāna should be cultivated on the basis of the experience produced during one of the empowerments (but the Gelugpas have a different perspective on this).

What about it? First of all, we have to understand the basis is empty, not just empty, since it is also clear but that emptiness is profound. This is fundamental in Dzogchen. Rig pa is not some permanent transcendent awareness. There is a point in time in which rig pa has not arisen, prior to the realization producing buddhas and nonrealization producing sentient beings. But this is a little outside the scope. Basically vidyā is just the mind that knows the appearance of the display as it own appearances. Avidyā is the mind that does not know that. Simple as pie.

No, absolutely not. Even in the tathāgatagarbha literature, the so called "self" that is being described is described in the Uttaratantra (as well as the commentary attributed to Asanga) on the basis of reality that is free from all extremes, that is to say the profound emptiness taught in Mahāyāna. 

If you propose that there is some other self outside the all, Buddha would reply:

The Blessed One said, "What is the All? Simply the eye &amp; forms, ear &amp; sounds, nose &amp; aromas, tongue &amp; flavors, body &amp; tactile sensations, intellect &amp; ideas. This, monks, is called the All. [1] Anyone who would say, 'Repudiating this All, I will describe another,' if questioned on what exactly might be the grounds for his statement, would be unable to explain, and furthermore, would be put to grief. Why? Because it lies beyond range."
http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka ... .than.html

There is clearly no intention by the Buddha to teach some transcendent ultimate non-dual awareness in the NIkayas/Agamas. People who assert the opposite are simply dreaming. 

So that's it, thats all there is.

In case you are worried that all those fabulous buddhaqualities would not be possible if emptiness is the real nature of everything, Nāgārjuna quips:

"For one whom emptiness is possible, for that one everything is possible;
for one whom emptiness is not possible, for that one everything is impossible."

Nirvana is a permanent state of cessation of birth in samsara. It is an extreme. That is why Mahāyāna conceived of the idea of so called non-abiding nirvana (in contrast with the Nikāya "abiding" nirvana), i.e., being in samsara but not of samsara. In general, the nirvana aspired to in Mahāyāna is the non-abiding nirvana. 

Basically, if the word emptiness raises the hair on your neck, it is sign that in the past you were a Mahāyāna practitioner. As for me, as soon as I heard the word "emptiness" I knew I was home, and have been a adherent of the Prajñāpāramitā ever since.

Hi Zim:

People did Ngondro, but the overall systematization of Ngondro seems to be a rather nineteenth century phenomena that spread from Kagyu to the other two schools i.e. Nyingma and Sakya. For example, the massive 350 folio commentary on the Lam 'bras preliminaries authored by Zimog Tulku in the nineteenth century was explicitly influenced by Kun bzang bla ma'i zhal lung. Before this text, there was no separate Sakya Ngondro commentary. And the first independent Ngondro text in Sakya was written by Dezhung Rinpoche. 

However, there was ngondro from an ancient period of time. For example, the klong gsal nyi ma 'bar ma rgyud [which probably dates to the 13th century and is the root tantra for the mkha' 'gro snying thig] has a fully elaborated ngondro from chapters 63-75. For example, the refuge chapter, 67, does not give a number. Chapter 73 specifies doing Vajrasattva for 21 days, for example. 

In general, I think the idea of doing 100,000 thousand comes from the idea of reciting mantras 100,000 times in the gsar ma tantras.

The rendering you are using is a somewhat inaccurate gloss. 

The text says:
saṁvṛtyā mādhyamikairastitvenābhyupagamānna tulyatā
དབུ་མ་པ་དག་གིས་ནི་ཀུན་རྫོབ་ཏུ་ཡོད་པར་ཁས་བླངས་པའི་ཕྱིར

"Because Mādhyamikas agree to existence in the relative..."

The text does not say they "assert" ['dod pa], or established [sgrub pa], etc. It says ābhyupagamā, which means assent, agree, etc. 

The Tibetan recension contains an extra passage: དེ་དག་གིས་ཁས་མ་བླངས་པའི་ཕྱིར་མི་མཚུངས་པ་ཉིད་དོ།

"and because they [atheists] do not agree [to existence in the relative], [mādhyamikas and atheists] are not the same. 

However, this passage is a clarification about what exists relatively, not ultimately. The set up for your citation is:

Here, someone contends "Mādhyamikas are no different than atheists [nāstikas, literally "deniers"]. For what reason? They claim virtuous and non-virtuous actions, agents, results and all worlds are empty of inherent existence., and also atheists also claim those things do not exist. Therefore, mādhyamikas are no different than atheists."

That is not so. Mādhyamikas are proponents of dependent origination. Because of production in connection with conditions this world and all other worlds beyond are proposed to be empty of inherent existence because they are produced in connection with conditions.  Other worlds and so on are not conceived as non-existent through emptiness of inherent existence because of production in connection with conditions.

Now then, if it is asked why, they [atheists] reject other things similar to the things perceived in this world based upon the inherent perception of things of this world, having not perceived coming into this world from another world and going into another world from this world. [a complex way of saying atheists only believe what they can see]

If it is said, "In that case, because they conceive the absence of existence in the intrinsic nature of things as non-existence there is a similarity through this view." It is not so. Because Mādhyamikas agree to existence in the relative and because they [atheists] do not agree [to existence in the relative], [mādhyamikas and atheists] are not the same.

The context of the language goes back to the idea that those who deny the Vedas are "nastikas", deniers or atheists [better word than nihilist, in my opinion]. Buddhists are considered nastikas by Hindus. Here Candra is rejecting the claim by pointing out cleverly that since Madhyamakas agree to [rather than assert or establish] such thing as karma, agents, results, this world, future worlds, etc., relatively speaking, even though they do not agree to essences, they agree to the moral structure of Indian religious discourse which in general is based on the idea of future lives, karma, etc. 

But I don't think we can consider these so called atheists necessarily Carvakas or Lokayatis, etc., people who for example assert existence by virtue of svābhava. The classic example representing the Carvaka view is that things exist through their nature just like the colors in a peacocks feather. No one created it, it just happens that way. Unfortunately, we do not have any actual Carvaka texts, just parodies of their views here and there in Buddhist and Hindu texts and plays. These so called atheists may very well be just those who do not subscribe to a siddhaṇta, whether buddhist nor non-buddhist. 

Finally, this passage does not defend your assertion that Tsongkhapa does not himself assert the ultimate is a non-existence, since we have already seen that you admit he does assert a non-existence as ultimate i.e. the non-existence of inherent existence in the ultimate.

Even the Buddha broke his vows of refuge, according to you, because he encouraged the Vajjians, the subjects of King Pasenadi, to continue to make offerings to and support non-Buddhist ascetics when they visited for offerings.

As I have written elsewhere; gzhan stong principally arises from the hermeneutical urge to reconcile the treatises of Maitreya and Nāgārjuna with one another. Because Tibetan scholars typically assume that Maitreyanatha is identical to the future Bodhisattva Maitreya, they often feel they cannot privilege Nāgārjuna's views over those of Maitreya. 

My feeling about Maitreyanatha is rather different. I feel he was just a normal human person, who lived at a time when there were three major trends of Mahāyāna sutras, i.e., prajñāpāramita, yogacara, and tathāgagarbha. He wrote five treatises:
Sūtrālaṃkara which presents a systematic account of Mahāyāna synthesizing all three trends primarily from a Yogacara perspective
Abhisamayālaṃkara which presents the implicit paths and stages concealed within the prajñāpāramita sutras
Uttaratantra which synthesizes the thought of the ten tathāgatagarbha sūtras
Madhyantavibhaga and the Dharmadharmatāvibhaga which analyzes specific issues in Yogacara thought. 

I do not feel that it is necessary to try and reconcile these various trends. What is important is to understand the ideas presented in these three trends and then observe how they are used by later schools and scholars. 

For example, the way tathāgatagarbha is used in Secret Mantra and Dzogchen is quite different than the way it is presented in the Uttaratantra. The way Dolbupa uses the three nature theory is very different than the way it is used in the Yogacara of Maitreya and Asanga.

While it is true that Dilgo Khyentse and Dudjom Rinpoche followed the gzhan stong school in terms of sutrayāna, there are many masters such as Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, and so on who do not follow the gzhan stong school. 

The primary reason why we think that Nyingma = gzhan stong is because the influence of Trungpa.

You would think that if tathāgatagarba were important to Asanga it would be mentioned in the Yogacarabhumi, but the word de bzhin gshegs pa'i snying po, tathāgatagarba, does not appear even once in the entire collection, and this is his Magnum Opus. 

Now, it is true that there is a commentary on the Uttaratantra attributed to Asanga, and some scholars believe it is authored by him as well; but if so, this merely reinforces my elsewhere mentioned thesis that the Yogacara school and the Tathāgatagarbha were regarded as separate streams in Indian Mahāyāna and not mixed up with each other. 

Of course, this statement in the Āryalaṅkāvatāra-nāma-mahāyānasūtravṛttitathāgatahṛdayālaṃkāra is very nice:

"The dharmatā of the mind liberated from the four extremes constitutes the sugatagarbha."

Here is another nice definition by Municandra in Sūtrālaṃkāravṛttibhāṣya:

"As such, since suchness exists in sentient beings, because of that, all sentient beings are tathāgatagarbhins." 

This means that sentient beings enclose or hold (garbhin) the garbha of the tathātagatas, i.e., suchness.

Of course the Tarkajvala by Bhavya maintains:

The statement "The tathāgata pervades" means wisdom pervades all objects of knowledge, but it does not mean abiding in everything like Viśnu. Further, "Tathāgatagarbhin" means emptiness, signlessness and absence of aspiration exist the continuums of all sentient beings, but is not an inner personal agent pervading everyone".

Yes, and this is why gzhan stong does not really go beyond the false aspectarian yogacara of Ratnakaraśanti. The main difference between the two is that the former avoids the error of the latter, who assert that the non-existence of the imagined nature in the dependent nature is the perfected nature, thus setting up an internal contradiction that the dependent nature becomes unconditioned. Charitably, we can say that gzhan stong is an intermediate view between Yogacara and Madhyamaka. 

The main error of the gzhan stong pas however, as I have written elsewhere, is the attempt to map the two truths onto the three natures, where they consider the perfected nature the ultimate and the imagined and the dependent natures relative. In doing, so, they basically do violence to the Yogacara school's own formulation of these three natures. The reason they do this is that there has been a compelling exegetical need of Tibetan scholars to rectify the treatises of Maitreya as a whole with the six texts of reasoning by Nāgārjuna. In the end, both systems lose since neither is accurately represented. Basically, gzhan stong represents an attempt to reconcile all the main lines of Indian Mahāyāna thought as I have noted elsewhere. 

Further, by mixing the tathātagarbha doctrine into the mix, they also ruin that. The odd thing is is that Asanga was not fond of the tathāgatagarbha school.

That depends entirely on which school of Buddhism you are talking about. The word we are using in Buddhism to describe something as a substance is dravya. For example, when we say something is dravyasat (Tib. rdzas yod), we mean it "substantially exists".

Many people act as if Madhyamaka and Madhyamaka influenced scholars present the truth (tm) in Buddhism. But it is not true. Madhyamakas continued to be criticized by both other Mahāyānists as well as by Nikāya schools until Buddhadharma perished in India. 

It is primarily because Vajrayāna Buddhism enshrined Madhyamaka as the supreme tenet of sūtra that today we observe Madhyamaka is the something like the King of Buddhist philosophy to which everyone must pay homage, even  scholars like Dolbupa.

That being said, I am myself, of course, of the conviction that Nāgārjuna got it right. Frankly, to borrow a phrase from Whithead, "The safest general characterization of the Buddhist philosophical tradition is that it consists of a series of footnotes to Nāgārjuna."

While there are of course Dzogchen texts that describe mind and body as separate, in general, the innermost secret cycle holds that the perception that there is a difference between the animate and inanimate is a mistaken one. In the sate of ultimate liberation, the distinction between animate and inanimate disappears because it is not true. Further, like other Vajrayāna traditions, Dzogchen provides a physical account for the process of rebirthm for example in the Vajramala Tantra it is proposed that the alayavijñāna inseparable with the mahāprāṇavāyu is responsible for transmigration, for the appropriation of a new series of aggregates. But Dzogchen goes a step further and explicitly identifies consciousness as the operation of a vāyu in the body. Vāyus of course are the function of the refined element of air inside the human body.

If we classify the kind of teaching that Batchelor and people like him, the so called Secular Buddhists, seem to advocate, they are teaching what is termed by the Buddha as "the vehicles of devas and humans".

Which I made clear at the outset. The self exists as an imputation, it does not exist where it is imputed, that is the meaning of "non-existent". The habit of grasping is responsible for that imputation, hence we have the term "the habit of grasping a non-existent self". This habit itself functions as an agent of karma and an object upon which karma ripens, without the self it imputes existing where it is imputed.

In my opinion basic standards which would indicate a person or a school is Buddhist in orientation are:

A dharma theory based on skandhas, dhātus and āyatanas.

A theory of suffering based on of affliction and dependent origination.

A path theory based on śamatha and vipaśyāna.

Acceptance of the four seals.

A concept of refuge.

I think that this basic framework provides a wide latitude for differences of opinion, including for example eternalist interpretations of the tathāgatagarbha sutras or the austere doctrine of emptiness taught in Madhyamaka and Prajñāpāramitā. It even has room for "heretics" like Batchelor and Zenmar.

You are a perennialist. This is fine, but you do realize that your views are a severely minority opinion in Buddhadharma. 

It is not a question of higher or lower realization. The fact is that the liberation to which you aspire is not one I share. It does not mean I am going to deny you the right to call yourself a Buddhist because you happen to hold views that I consider to be out of step with the primary trends of the evolution of Buddhist teachings. The fact is that the liberation to which Batchelor aspires is not one I share. The fact is that the liberation to which the Pure Land people aspire is not one I share. The fact is that the liberation to which the Theravadins aspire is not one I share. The fact is that the liberation to which Zen practitioners aspire is not one I share. But they are all Buddhists and the all aspire to freedom. 

Beyond that, the fact is that the liberation to which Samkhya, Vedanta, Yoga, Vaiśeṣika, Nyaya and Mimamsa aspire is not one I share. But they are also seeking freedom, so I consider them Dharma, albeit, not Buddhadharma. The same goes with all other spiritual paths. 

We are all alike in that we are seeking truth and freedom that truth brings. But I do not think for an instant that we all seeking the same truth or the same freedom.  

The strength of Buddha's patched robe is that it is able to accommodate such disagreement and so many different point of view of about what Buddha himself meant when he discoursed about truth and freedom. 

When it comes to tenets, I think Madhyamaka is the most definitive teaching, when it comes to sūtras, think the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras are the most definitive, and I when it comes to vajrayāna, I think Dzogchen is the most definitive teaching. But that is just my perspective.

The translators did a fine job on that book. The person who didn't get it right was Dudjom Rinpoche. He just repeated a gloss that is found in many earlier books, and he apparently never looked up the original citation to check it. Tibetan scholarship in general is not known for originality, and it is also not known for detailed citation checking. Mostly people just repeat what they hear from their teachers. Great Lamas are no different in this respect.

In Bhavya's text, the difference between the so called coarse outer madhyamaka and the inner subtle madhyamaka merely has to do with how relative truth is treated. I reproduce the entire passage below. You will notice an absence of the terms Prasanga, Svatantra. When one, as a Madhyamaka, treats relative truth from the perspective of the śravakas, this is considered coarse outer madhyamaka. When relative truth is treated from the cittamatra point of view, then this becomes the subtle inner madhyamaka:

When phenomenal entities are categorized, in this way there are two kind: material and immaterial. In this way, material entities appearing as portions of subtle atoms do not exist and also subtle atoms appearing as limited by different directions do not exist. They are immaterial mind. Meanwhile, mind and mental factors are engaged for a moment.Since appearing because of the very subtle aspect through the differentiation of past, present and future does not exist, minds and mental factors are not established, becoming the nature of the dharmadhātu, in which one should abide. The Mother states: "That mind is not mind, because the primal nature [prakṛiti] of the mind is luminosity" and "whever the mind does not exist, that is inconceivable". 

Further, all phenomena can be gathered into the mind, mind gathered into the body, after the body is gathered into the dharmadhātu, it dissolves. The meaning of this is also spoken of by the Ācarya Nāgārjuna in the Madhyamaka Bhāvasaṃkranta:

The world comes from concepts; concepts come from the mind;
the mind is supported on the body, for that reason investigate the body. 

One should dwell in such a meaning. Do not do not dwell on any kind of occasion or consciousness. Do not conceive anything, do not think about anything, do not dwell all extremes. The essence of any consciousness has not arisen, one should meditate on nothing at all. Further, that prajñā of through analysis does not appear. For example, since fire is produced by rubbing to sticks together vigorously, if the wood is burnt, also the that fire is understood to naturally pacified, because it also has become non-existent. The meaning of this can be understood in the Ārya-kāśyapaparivarta sūtra. Further, in the Ārya-ghanavyūha sūtra:

Just the fire which is the burning agent does not exist 
since the burnt object does not exist,
likewise if one burns the view to be incinerated, 
also the fire of emptiness will cease. 
At the time of the cessation of views, 
the fire of wisdom will not be produced, 
all afflictions having been incinerated. 
If the afflictions are incinerated, the aspect is beautiful.

Mahāsukha (aka Padmavajra) says:

Having burned the bundle of firewood of views
with the fire of emptiness, 
this is abiding in peace, 
in which the fire of suchness has also ceased.

As such, having taught the coarse yoga, now the subtle yoga will be taught. This is subtle i.e. all dharmas there can be arise as the appearances of one's mere illusory mind itself. In this way, the mere illusory mind is beyond the three times. Without color or shape, luminous through its primal nature. Since it does not appear, all phenomena are to be understood as being the illusory mind itself. There are also citations. The Ārya Lankāvatara states:

In dependance on mind-only, 
do not analyze outer objects; 
in dependence upon suchness
one must transcend mind-only. 
If one transcends mind-only, 
one will abide in non-appearances. 
The yogi abiding in non-appearances, 
he sees the Mahāyāna. 

Ārya Nāgārjuna, Ācarya Āryadeva, Ācarya Candrakīrti speak it in these words. In this way, speaking about the relative truth in the manner of the śravakas is the coarse outer madhyamaka. That [relative] existing as one's mind only is the so called  "inner madhyamaka" which is subtle. 

There are three things to include here: one, this author, Bhavya, is very late -- he is not the same author as Bhavaviveka. This is proven by two things: one, he mentions Candrakirti. Second, he cites Mahasukha aka Padmavajra and directly cites Padmavajra's text Sakalatantrasambhavasaṃcodanī-śrīguhyasiddhi-nama. Padmavajra may be the same person as Padmasambhava. 

At any rate, this text itself is no later than the tenth century but no earlier than the eighth.  This places Bhavya subsequent to Padmavajra, that and Atisha brought the text to Tibet in the 11th. 

Third, Bhavya mentions a great madhyamaka three times in this text. But first person we know of to use the term in any surviving text was the Tibetan Kawa Paltseg. He uses the term great madhyamaka as a sobriquet for freedom from extremes. 

So frankly, when gzhan stong pas use this passage from Bhavya to support their notion that great madhyamaka is a non-analytical meditation, their reasoning is pretty flimsy when the citation they use to distinguish an outer and an inner madhyamaka.

Title: Re: Early Buddhism and Mahayana

It is more complicated than that. I spent a few minutes this morning running a word search on the bka' 'gyur and I found that only five of the ten tathagatagarbhasūtras say anything at all about the dharmadhātu, and only four of them say anything meaningful. 

The Angulimāla sutra says:

The dhātu of all sentient beings (sarvasattvadhātu) is the dharmadhātu,
since flesh is consumed of the same dhātu, the buddhas do not consume meat. 

It is presented in the context of eating meat. Basically, cannibalism is a taboo in general, and by making the observation that the dharmdhātu is the sattvadhātu, in this sutra the Buddha is making an argument we ought not meat since we are all of the same kind. 

The Nirvana Sūtra only contains two explicit mentions of the dharmadhātu:

Empty peace is the dharmadhātu...

Son of a good family, if one of average prajñā truly courses in the dharmadhātu, wisdom of perfection, ultimate truth and ultimate emptiness, that one will attain the śravakas awakening; the one of medium prajñā, the pratyekabuddha awakening, and one is best prajñā, unsurpassed awakening. 

There is another sūtra, Ārya-maladevīsiṃhanāda sūtra, that states:

"Bhagavan, this tathāgatagarbha is the sublime dharmadhātu. It is the dharmakāyagarbha, it is the garbha of transcendent phenomena [lokkotaradharmas], it is the garbha of the naturally pure dharmakāya. Bhagavan, since temporary secondary afflictions are naturally pure as the tathāgatagarbha, these secondary afflictions are the site of the tathāgatas."

This sutra pretty clearly states that afflicted phenomena cannot be excluded from the tathāgatagarbha, more or less repeating the thinking of the Angulimala sūtra above. 

Ok, therefore, we can see that that tathagatagarbha sūtras are of no help in defining dharmadhātu. 

The Ārya-gaganagañjaparipṛcchā-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra is the likely locus classicus for the explicit notion that the dharmadhātu is a source. Let me preface this by saying that in Tibetan, the term "dhātu" is glossed as a 'byung gnas, a locus of production, not as a basis or a foundation [gzhi/rtsa ba]. The nature of meaning of the term dhātu is translated into is "dbyings", which has a native meaning as a dimension [klong] or a element [khams]. When it is defined by Vasubandhu he defines the term dhātu as being similar to a mine. Now, the sūtra states:

Phenomena do not come and do not go, they dwell in the dharmadhātu; 
all that appears as form, it all comes from space;
all that appears as phenomena[dharmas], those come from the dharmadhātu. 

Still we are no closer to a conclusive definition of dharmadhātu. 

The Lankāvatara helps us:
Suchnness, emptiness, nirvana and the dharmadhātu,
the non-arising phenomena, are nature of the ultimate. 

So here in this text we have a clear demonstration that suchnness, emptiness, nirvana and the dharmadhātu are all to be treated as synonymous. 

The Śatasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā states:
Further, because the dharmadhātu does not exist, it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the extreme of the past; because the dharmadhātu is emptiness, it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the extreme of the past; because the dharmadhātu is isolated it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the extreme of the past; because the dharmadhātu lacks an intrinsic nature, it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the extreme of the past. Further, because the dharmadhātu does not exist, it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the extreme of the future; because the dharmadhātu is emptiness, it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the extreme of the future; because the dharmadhātu is isolated it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the extreme of the future; because the dharmadhātu lacks an intrinsic nature, it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the extreme of the future. Further, because the dharmadhātu does not exist, it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the middle; because the dharmadhātu is emptiness, it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the middle; because the dharmadhātu is isolated it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the middle; because the dharmadhātu lacks an intrinsic nature, it is not perceived by the bodhisattvas in the middle. 


So in reality, we see that in the Tathagatagarbha sūtra cycle, the notion of dharmadhātu is rather neglected doctrinally; I would suggest, precisely because of its association with emptiness as presented in the PP sūtras, which in no way permits a reading of a positive ground which serves as the basis for the arising of phenomena. And as we have seen above, the Nirvana sūtra explicitly defines dharmadhātu as emptiness.

Conditioned phenomena dependently originate; unconditioned phenomena do not arise at all. Other than that, there is no source. This is why dependent origination is called "profound". The logic of dependent origination precludes a "source" for conditioned phenomena, transcendent or otherwise. 

Your view is just one among many imports into Buddhadharma, just like Batchelor's views. In my opinion you are both mistaken -- but that does not really matter, because intellectual views like yours and Batchelors, in the end, are not what bring about realization.

Whatever is the nature of the Tathāgata, that is the nature of the world;

There are three kinds of unconditioned phenomena (asamskritadharma) we find in Buddhist texts: space and the two kinds of cessation. Of these two last, one is mere absence of a cause for arising, and the second is nirvana i.e. a cessation which is due to analysis.

In Mahāyāna a fourth is added i.e. śūnyatā, emptiness.

Well, now you are screwed. If you cannot accept that functionality of the habit of imputing a non-existence self, which in turn functions as an agent, you need to propose an existing agent to explain rebirth which is not a mere habit of grasping a self, and if you do that, you will end up with a mass of contradictions. For example, you might try and propose consciousness as an agent of rebirth (ala Bhavaviveka), but that presents a lot of problems.

I understand the mechanism of rebirth in a couple of ways. First, the habit of grasping a non-existent self leads to the appropriation of aggregates in which a self cannot be found. This non-existent self can function as an agent and recipient of karma.

The second has to do with tantric anatomy and principles.

You are merely flinging around a reactionary term you have not defined. What kind of materialist is Batchelor: money, cars and sex? Is he a dialectical materialist? 

There is nothing in Batchelor's writings to indicate that he has decided that consciousness is solely a result of material interactions. Merely that he has personally abandoned all metaphysical speculations about rebirth and such questions, and feels that in the context of Buddha's teaching of anatman, Buddha's accounts of rebirth are largely mythological, generated with respect the milieu Buddha was teaching in. I think he even grants that Buddha may have believed these stories. But his point, one to which I now agree, is that the practice of Buddhadharma does not depend on accepting the Jatakas as literally true, or accepting the Buddha's account as having been the first human king in a past life, and so on. 

That being said, I imagine that Batchelor probably is a physicalist, but that is different than being a materialist. 

Batchelor generally says a perfectly respectable thing: consciousnesses arise based on specific conditions. When you study Abhidharma you will discover that in Abhidharma (as well as Madhyamaka in general) claim that without a sense organ and a sense object, a consciousness cannot arise. It is never said that without a consciousness and a sense organ, the object won't arise, or that the without the sense object, the sense organ won't arise. All these texts clearly state that a consciousness arises only when there is a functioning sense organ and a sense object. This is a perfectly reasonable thing to assert in the context of Buddhism. 

So this is another area in which you attempt at blackballing Batchelor fails utterly. 

So I can either blackball you for having an eternalist view of nirvana and blackball Batchelor for not accepting the doctrine of rebirth literally or I can be expansive and understand that even though you both suffer from some wrong views, you both are still within the Buddhadharma.

You do not have to accept rebirth literally to accept "sarva dukkham". If the solution to suffering in this life is calming the mind with shamatha and developing the insight which burns away afflictions (it is), then what does believing in rebirth have to do with it? 

If you have ended your afflictions you won't take rebirth again, according to Buddha's teachings, anyway. So what does it matter? All that matters is that one sees through the matrix of conditions that create your suffering here and now. 

This is the minimum requirement. 

So, in this thread, we have seen three things:

1) The four seals do not require belief in rebirth
2) Refuge in the Three Jewels do not require belief in rebirth
3) Belief in an eternal unconditioned ultimate is not a requirement to be a Buddhist. 

In realty, no beliefs of any kind are required to enter the Buddha's path. 

What we need to understand about Batchelor, for example, and many Westerners like him, is that they are trying. They are inspired by the Buddha's example, and they accept what makes sense to them. 

Buddhadharma is not about belief and faith. Ultimately, like all Indian yogic paths, it is about personal experience: direct perception and inferences derived from those based on one's practice. It is a personal journey, not one that exists in a catechism. There is no "bible" in Buddhadharma. Rather, Buddhadharma holds a range teachings from belief in an inexpressible self which is neither the same nor different than aggregates [pudgalavadins] to the crypto Vedantic musings of Dolbupa, to the explicit refutation of the unconditioned by Nāgārjuna and the assertion that nirvana is a non-existent [sautrantikas]. 

So now, Buddhists, you have to make room for a new understanding of Dharma, one that does not include rebirth as a vital central principle. It won't kill you to be generous.

I don't see Batchelor discarding dependent origination, he states:

The Buddha awakened to a glittering plurality of endlessly arising and vanishing phenomena. No God created it; no Mind underpins it; no Unconditioned lies somewhere outside it. Ethics, meditation and wisdom are not founded on some absolute truth, but grow out of a careful examination of what causes suffering and what brings it to an end.

I differ with Batchelor in that I accept rebirth. But I do not see how the above violates some sacred Buddhist principles resulting in the fatwa Vidyārāja has pronounced above.

BTW, avidyā is not held to be the cause of existence in dependent origination, because that would make ignorance/avidyā unconditioned itself.

Since the Sautrantikas strictly define nirvana as a cessation, a non-existence, would you deny them the claim they are Buddhist because they do not support your eternalist vision of nirvana?

Batchelor feels that his view is dependent origination. He derives that view from the Buddha. Dependent origination is the essence of the Buddhist view for most people.

BTW, there are many people who think Dolpopa's view i.e. gzhan stong, is a corrupt view of Buddhadharma.

So there are two things which are not mentioned in the four seals: belief in rebirth, and belief in a transcendent existent nirvana. These two beliefs of yours are not required in order to consider someone a follower of the Buddha's teachings.

Batchelor practices that portion of Buddhadharma that he can accept. That makes him a follower of Buddhadharma whether you like it or not. He accepts that all conditioned phenomena are impermanent, that all afflicted phenomena are suffering, and that all phenomena lack self. He probably also accepts that nirvana is peaceful. In other words, I am quite certain he accepts the four seals. Among the four seals there is not one word that mentions rebirth. He takes refuge in the Buddha, Dharma and Sangha. 

I am quite certain that Buddha, being kinder than you, would find room for Batchelor among his students. 

He just has problems with literal rebirth because he is a physicalist, just as you are a substance dualist. From my point of view, you are both wrong.

The point here is that we need to be aware of the fact that we are following narratives, preferring one narrative to another. There is not much meaning to the term "awakened one" if there is no narrative connected with their awakening. This is why there are compelling narratives around the liberations of Shakyamuni, Padmasambhava, Tonpa Shenrab and so on. 

If we prefer so-called "early Buddhism" to Mahāyāna, or vice versa, we are giving preference to one story over another.

Taboo sexual practices? Like having sex? With real people? Vajrayāna is just more practical, that's all. And in terms of violence, all Buddhists did in those days was appropriate the symbols of ritual violence and procedures that were well known in their culture. 

What I think most people ignore is that prior to the rise of Vajrayāna, there was a huge Puranic revolution that popularized and made available many rites and rituals that previously have been the precinct only of ritual specialists i.e. Brahmins. Buddhists used these rites and symbols, even making arguments for why Buddhist homavidhi was more effective than that of traditional Brahmins. The fact is that Buddhist ritual specialists increasingly took business away from Brahmins. In the context of Indian culture, anyone sufficiently expert in the general lines of Vajrayāna ritual, derived from Brahmanic dinācarya anyway, could replace a Brahmanic priest. This was not true in the day of the Buddha. Buddhist rulers for example continued to rely on Brahmin priests for state functions, etc. It is only after the fall of the Gupta that we see the rise in Vajrayāna texts, and this corresponds to the breaking of traditional patron/priest relationships in Northern India, and the replacement of the old order with new Buddhist ritual experts.

That's the point -- enlightenment, awakening, is just a story. We all subscribe to different stories of awakening. Some people like to imagine that their story is more solid, more real, that the stories of others. Certainly I have been guilty of this. 

Basically, the fact that there is a story of awakening at all is the essence of Dharma. What does not matter very much are the details, except to you, the practitioner. If you ask me what story of awakening I like, I will very swiftly tell you that I like the story of awakening as it is presented in the teachings of self-liberation, Dzogchen. I like it more than the story of awakening presented in the path of renunciation or the path of transformation. I like it more than the story of awakening presented in Samkhya, Trika, Vedanta and so on. The vehicle of self-liberation is my preferred story. I can't convince you to accept my story of liberation anymore than I could have been convinced of it when I was committed to Buddhism as a religion by someone else. Likewise, I cannot convince any one here of any story about liberation they are not disposed to believe. 

But the one thing we share is that we all subscribe to narrative about liberation otherwise we would not be here discussing these issues. And that is why there is no closed Canon in Buddhism, why there never can be. 

Buddhists, like all other religionists, like to think that they are the only ones who have a true story. Among Buddhists, all assert their preferred story of liberation as the best, or most practical, or the only possible, or the most historically accurate, and so on. 

We Dharma practitioners demonstrate our commitment to our preferred stories by the choices we make, and the practices we do. But in the end we are merely making a commitment to a narrative of liberation we have decided to accept. And that is completely subjective, personal and non-verifiable. No one's putative awakening is verifiable by any objective, empirical standard -- and in these conversations about liberation we all behave as if there were some objective criteria by which liberation can be measured. This is absurd. Every standard by which we can measure liberation and awakening is a complete and utterly arbitrary mental line drawn in space. All of our narratives of liberation come from space too, just like clouds billowing in the sky.

Basically, it is really pretty simple.

In fact, the first text to mention cakras is the Hevajra tantra -- even though the idea of nadis is very ancient. The notion of prāṇayāma and pratyahara, etc. are found in the Majjihma Nikaya and so on. 

You need to read Davidson's book, he addresses the majority of your concerns quite well. 

In this respect, there is a pan-Indian yogic culture, a toolbox of realization if you will, used by all schools who have different understandings of the results of that practice. 

Buddha did not reject yoga, for example, he was a yogi. There is very little difference between how practice is described in the Yoga Sutras and what is described in Pali Buddhist scriptures. Though many people imagine that Patañjali was responding to Buddhists, I think this is a naive assumption.

Ronald Davidson has pointed out several shortcomings of Sanderson's theories in Indian Esoteric Buddhism. 

I like what Dan Martin says, when defending Bon as a form a Buddhism:

"Eventually, and with the help of a very small band of Buddhologists who have been speaking rather too softly over the years, we will find out that Buddhism has always been a religion of continual revelation...the canonizers of Buddhist scriptures, if they were looking for integrity, would have done well to be satisfied with parts of one or two sūtras, much as our contemporary researchers for 'original Buddhism' would have us do. Then we today would be in a much better position, since ninety-nine percent of the Buddhist scriptures could be relegated to that great and greatly ignored category of 'apocrypha', could be safely dispensed with, just as the Bon canon as a whole has itself been pre-dispensed with."

The immediate cause for suffering and anxiety is the three afflictions. There are three ways to deal with these: renunciation, transformation or self-liberation. 

The latter two require instruction by a qualified guru. The former does not. In my estimation, the latter two are more effective in this day and age, as we have already discussed elsewhere.

Sounds like we are dealing with a not-even-marginally-adequate-in-terms-of-qualities guru here. And the implication of your post could lead one to believe that you disapprove separating oneself from a guru of questionable merits. 

Actually, it is really, really easy to learn how to construct a mandala, read a liturgy, perform some mudras, ring a bell, wave a vajra around in the air and play a damaru, etc. Along with that, dress up in some traditional robes, look Tibetan, and walla, now you are a Guru. 

The hard part about being a guru is guiding people along the path of Buddhahood when you yourself are not a Buddha — and that is where the pitfalls and dangers lay. Guiding people without conditioning them, helping them to understand and then open up their innate capacity for awakening is not easy. Frankly most so called "gurus" these days are just marketing religion in the name of awakening. 

Anyone can learn a ritual or two. Waking up is a different matter.

Hi Phil:

Dzogchen is not, as is commonly assumed, merely a teaching about the nature of the mind. It is, by itself, a separate vehicle and path to liberation, complete and independent from beginning to end. 

Can it be approached gradually, via lower vehicles. Sort of. But it is possible, and in my opinion best, to practice Dzogchen by itself as a complete path. It is not a path for superior people, it is a superior path for inferior people.

Does Dzogchen have some common features with lower yanas such as refuge, and so on. Of course. But it is different in how it approaches such things.

Who knows? I know another person who claims they experienced rigpa by merely being in Tulku Orgyen's presence without him even uttering a single word, before they have even received a single word of Dzogchen, and according to this person, when TU was asked about this experience later on, this person claims that TU confirmed that it indeed was rigpa this person experienced. This person is also not a person who is setting themselves up as a teacher, etc. 

The only really important question a person should ask, and then only to themselves "Would I take teaching from this Mr. Bertelsen?" There are three answers, yes, no and "wait and see". 

At this point I do not really see what the benefit to this continued discussion is. I certainly think that Mr. Bertelesen would prefer it if we not make him a continued subject of our scrutiny, because as far as I can tell, apart from naively sharing his experience in a book, he is harming no one that I can see. After all, this is just religion and people can believe whatever the hell they want. Some people believe that Trungpa was a horrible person, other people believe he was a saint, for example. The same is true of HHDL. In the end we are merely left with our own judgements and speculations and these judgements and speculations harm us much more than they harm their object.

5. thal ba'i be con
6. thal ba'i rgyun

9. thal ba'i rlung
10. rin po che'i rlung thal ba
11. 'du ba'i thal ba
12. dung ldan thal ba
13. skar ma'i thal ba

Each one is called a buddhafield, because each one also has a teacher, retinue, teaching, etc. 

While the commentary on the text indeed glosses "thal ba" as brdal ba in this context i.e. "spread out", however, Norbu Rinpoche maintains that "thal ba" means "beyond". 

What the text says is that there are eight types of thal ba'i gnas. 

1. 'jig rten khams (durgatiloka)
2. shing khams (kṣetraloka, buddhafields)
3. dam bca' skyobs
4. skyon gnas
5. 'pheb pa'i sa
6. sbyor ba
7. grags
8. song ba'i gnas

No, he is referring to the so called "thal ba'i gnas", of which there are thirteen. thal ba may mean "galaxy" or it may mean "universe". It is certainly broader than a solar system. 

Within these thirteen thal ba are so called "fields" (kṣetras, zhing khams). The term zhing khams is often translated as "pure land", but that is inaccurate -- there are both pure and impure kṣetras. A better term is "buddhafield", since a kṣetra is defined as the field of activity of a given Buddha or bodhisattva. All of the zhing khams mentioned in these thirteen thal bas contain buddhas. 

In these thirteen thal bas and their buddhafields it is maintained that Dzogchen teachings are presently found during this epoch.

Its ok, it just sounds weird to me, and honestly, it does not really convey the genitive sense of sems kyi chos nyid i.e. the dharmatā of the mind, which is in my opinion what the term sems nyid is generally glossing in Tibetan.


Author: Malcolm
Date: Wed Aug 28, 2013 10:33 pm
Title: Re: Jes Bertelsen?
Content:
You can render it this way: the mind essence is the entity of the mind. 

In Tibetan it is always redundant, "the mind itself is the essence of mind" is also redundant. 

That is why it necessary to look for context.It depends on whether nyid is rendering eva i.e. just so, etc. or tā as in chos nyid.

For example "'DI DAG GIS NI SEMS NYID GZUGS SU SNANG BA NYID DU BSTAN TO" "Both of those are the mind itself (or just the mind, only the mind) shown as appearing as matter/form" This is clearly an "eva" usage. 

Here however we have a sems nyid aka sems kyi chos nyid:

	
SGRON MA GSAL BAR BYED PA ZHES BYA BA'I RGYA CHER BSHAD PA:
RANG GI SEMS KYI CHOS NYID LA GNAS PA NI RANG GI SEMS KYI ROL BA'O "Abiding in the nature [dharmatā] of one's mind is the play of one's mind"

Or 	
DBU MA RIN PO CHE'I SGRON MA ZHES BYA BA:

GANG GI TSE GZUGS LA SOGS PA'I DMIGS PA RNAMS SEMS LAS PHYI ROL NA MI SNANG BA DE'I TSE RANG GI SEMS KYI CHOS NYID LA NGES PAR GNAS PA'I SEMS NI 

GNYIS SU MED PA'I YE SHES ZHES BYA

When the perceptions of matter and so on do not appear external to the mind, at that time the mind that definitely abides in the nature [dharmatā] of one's mind is called "non-dual wisdom". 

So basically, the issue is distinguishing sems nyid as cittaiva and sems nyid as a gloss for citta dharmatā -- and sometimes that can be difficult. 

For example, if we take your example and apply the principle that sems nyid here means sems kyi chos nyid, your sentence in both instances makes more sense "The dharmatā (nature) of the mind is the primal nature of the mind" and "The dharmatā (nature) of the mind is the essence/entity of the mind". It becomes a little strange if we say "The mind itself is the primal nature of the mind" or "The mind itself is the essence/entity of the mind" -- so the cittaiva does not work here.

Sems nyid is a translation of cittatā or citta dharmatā. The tā suffix can mean essence; it can also simply mean "is"; or also "itself" -- as you know it clearly depends on context.

Content:
Yes, rig pa can be called "recognizing the nature the mind". You always have "the nature of mind". 

Of course, there are Dzogchen teachings which criticize this approach however, because it is held that buddhahood cannot be found in the mind. 

So calling rig pa "the recognition of the nature of the mind" is quite provisional.

In the grand scheme of things there is almost nothing one can do to stem the suffering of others in samsara. Not even Buddha can remove the suffering of others. However, one can remove one's own suffering. And for this reason these sorts of conversations, in the grand scheme of things, are critically important.

The suffering of samsara is horrible. 

Actually understanding what the term "rig pa" means is important for those who wish to end their suffering, since all Dharma paths, both Hindu and Buddhist, define the cause of suffering as ignorance (avidyā, ma rig pa) and the cause of liberation as knowledge (vidyā, rig pa). 

Understanding the distinction between Mahāmudra and Dzogchen is important for those who wish to follow one path versus the other, for whatever their personal reasons may be. For others the distinction may not be important.

The definitive source of Dzogchen teachings is a Buddha by the name of Garab Dorje. He taught the tantras of the three series, sems sde, klong sde and man ngag sde. Secondarily, there are the various instructions that attached to these three series, such as the Vima snyin thig and so on. Finally, there are the surviving commentaries on these various texts. Then there are commentaries written by early Tibetan masters such as Vairocana and Nub Sangye Yeshe, etc. Finally there are the commentaries of Longchenpa. 

This taken together can be understood as the definitive sources for Dzogchen teachings. 

Of course, without a living Guru, one cannot receive transmission into Dzogchen teaching, and without that transmission, all these books are just so much dry tinder.

No, the teaching of Dzogchen is actually very simple: the difference between a buddha (awakened without the performance of even the smallest virtuous deeds) and a sentient being (wandering in samsara without initially having performed the least non-virtuous deed) is the simple recognition or non-recognition of one's own state. 

There is, according to ChNN, no possible way to remove all the negative karma accumulated for countless lifetimes in samsara. So it is impossible that a teacher likewise can do this for one, from the perspective of Dzogchen teaching.

Here is an alternate translation with the comments of Geshe Sonam RInchen:

"So long as the understanding of appearances As unfailing dependent arising and of emptiness Free from all assertions seem disparate, You still do not comprehend the Subduer's thought."

The understanding of the dependently arising and unfailing way in which causes and conditions produce their effects is a cognition of conventional reality, while the understanding that everything is empty of true existence is a cognition of the ultimate mode in which things exist. The way in which these two understandings apprehend their objects differs. So long as they seem incompatible and your understanding of a thing's dependently arising nature appears to undermine your understanding of its emptiness of true existence and vice versa, you still have not gained insight into what the Buddha intended to reveal nor have you found the correct view of the Middle Way. This is an indication that you must continue to persevere."

Geshe Sonam Rinchen. The Three Principal Aspects of the Path (Kindle Locations 1283-1287). Kindle Edition. 

He continues to explain:

In the eleventh verse he mentions emptiness "free from all assertions." In the twelfth verse he refers to an understanding which "destroys through certainty the way the object is perceived." These phrases may be variously interpreted. "The mainstay of misconceptions" is generally viewed as true existence itself." The qualification of emptiness as being "free from all assertions" may be taken to mean that words cannot describe emptiness as it is. It can also refer to emptiness free from any assertions of intrinsic existence. Some early masters in Tibet, who subscribed to the Madhyamika view that everything is empty of inherent existence, found it difficult to posit conventional existence. They contended that since all phenomena are empty, they cannot be specified as this or that, as either existent or non-existent, and that proponents of the Middle Way hold no position, since they propound emptiness free from all assertions.

Geshe Sonam Rinchen. The Three Principal Aspects of the Path (Kindle Locations 1295-1300). Kindle Edition. 

Here, Geshe Sonam Rinchen clearly differentiates the view you attribute to the Gelugpas from the actual Gelug view with this statement "Some early masters in Tibet, who subscribed to the Madhyamika view that everything is empty of inherent existence, found it difficult to posit conventional existence. They contended that since all phenomena are empty, they cannot be specified as this or that, as either existent or non-existent, and that proponents of the Middle Way hold no position, since they propound emptiness free from all assertions."

But this statement is not the Gelug view. The Gelug view is that emptiness is the mere absence of true existence i.e. "the understanding that everything is empty of true existence is a cognition of the ultimate mode in which things exist." Further, the Gelugpas claim that not only is this a view, it is the Prasangika view. The Gelugpas never claim that Prasangikas do not have a view. Quite the opposite in fact.

It is about time you started offering some citations in defense of your novel presentation of Tsongkhapa's views. 

The only thing I can imagine is that your Geshe is a renegade with the Gelugpa school, someone who has decided to follow Ganden Chophel's perspective. But Ganden Chophel's views and those of Tsongkhapa are at complete odds with each other.

This was hardly Tsongkhapa's most important guru. Can you name even a single practice passed down in Gelug from this master? This master is mainly significant for Nyingmapas because on the series of questions Lhodrak validates Dzogchen for Tsongkhapa. But Tsongkhapa was not a Dzogchen practitioner. 

Arguably, Tsongkhapa's most important Guru would be been Lama Umapa (Kadampa)(, from whom Tsongkhapa received the short lineage of Vajrabhairava, as well as many instructions from Manjushri. Other important masters would have been Lama Dampa Sonam Gyaltsen (Sakya), from whom Tsongkhapa received Cakrasamvara and Rendawa Shonu Lodo (Sakya) from whom he received Guhyasamaja. He also received the transmission of Guhyasamaja and Cakrasamvara as well as Naro Chos drug from Drikung.

Tsongkhapa has not single work in his corpus devoted to Mahāmudra alone. 

Gelug Mahāmudra was developed many centuries later by the First Panchen Lama.

Gelug 101: "does not exist in the ultimate, does not exist in the relative". Tsongkhapa explicitly rejects the analysis of three and four in your list because according to him they are merely double negations. 

What you have presented is the non-Gelugpa presentation of freedom from four extremes, which is explicitly rejected by Tsongkhapa in Lamrim Chenmo and elsewhere as being incorrect. Tsongkhapa only rejects inherent existence, the subtle object of negation -- he never advocates rejecting existence, the coarse object of negation.

The first person to use this term in Tibet was Kawa Paltseg. He uses the term dbu ma chen po to refer to spros bral, freedom from extremes. His presentation of Madhyamaka bears no observable commonalities with gzhan stong.

The Sakyapas follow Kawa Paltseg's point of view, and refer to their Madhyamaka as great Madhyamaka also. The Gelugpas also refer to Lama Tsongkhapa's point of view as Great Madhyamaka.

So basically, everyone in Tibet refers to their preferred system of Madhyamaka as "great".

Title: Re: Views of Shentong and Dolpopa

Strains of gzhan stong exist in Sakya, Kagyu and Nyingma. 

gZhan stong is fundamentally a new mantra (sngags gsar ma) school position, having arrived to Tibet with the 11th century translator, Yumo Mikyo Dorje, as a oral instruction related to Kalacakra. So from that point of view, gzhan stong and Dzogchen are historically unrelated. 

gZhan stong, along with the Jonang tradition of Kalacakra, was imported into the Kagyu via a 17th century Nyingma Lama named Rigzin Tsewang, who was the root guru of the Karma Kagyu Lama, Situ Panchen. Situ Panchen was originally disinterested in gzhan stong, so the story goes, but because his view was a bit nihilistic, Rigzin Tsewang advised Situ Panchen to adopt the gzhan stong view in order to extend his life. After that, gzhan stong view spread widely among Karma Kagyu in Eastern Tibet. However, the lineage did not widely spread amongst the Nyingma school itself until the time of Khyentse and Kongtrul. Because Kongtrul was such a strong exponent of gzhan stong, many Kagyus and Nyingmapas adopted gzhan stong as their own view. However, as far as Nyingma goes, just as many did not. Presently, Nyingmapas are evenly divided more or less between those who follow the "freedom from extremes" Madhyamaka position set forth by Kawa Paltseg in the early 9th century and neo-gzhan sting stong as presented by Kongtrul. 

In general, since the madhyamaka system of the two truths is incompatible with Dzogchen, what need to mention the Yogacara system of three natures? However, just as a person can maintain a sutrayāna view of Gelug prasangika (for example, Jigme Lingpa) and still be a Dzogchen practitioner, one can also maintain the view of gzhan stong and be a Dzogchen practitioner -- since your intellectual views are pretty irrelevant if you are a Dzogchen practitioner, or even a Vajrayana practitioner. The standard early Nyingma view (i.e. Rongzom, Rogben, etc.) is that the view of tantra in general and Dzogchen in particular is higher than that of madhyamaka in general.

Pabhongkha, when he was younger, had a close relationship with one of the Zimog Tulkus of Nalendra Phenpo, from whom he received most of the Sakya traditions he favored (such as four faced Mahākala, and so on). 

Apparently (since I have not actually read his bio), he had a vision of Vajrayogini who encouraged him to merge the stream of Naro Khachö teachings&nbsp;with the view of Tsongkhapa. 

In one sense, Yogini was an ideal practice for this -- it (unlike Lamdre) does not have any extensive instructions of view on its own, being purely a practice cycle. So in Sakya, Yogini is practiced in the broader context of the Lamdre view. One common approach is that Hevajra is used for working on creation stage, and Yogini for completion stage. 

Secondly, Pabhongkha was a specialist in Cakrasamvara, and Yogini is the essence of Cakrasamvara practice. If one practices Yogini, the entire Cakrasamvara mandala is included.

Basically, the pre-Pabhongkha tradition of VY is unchanged from the Sakya presentation. But Pabhongkha made a number of changes to the tradition based on his own intellectual ideas of how the practice should be brought into line with the broader Cakrasamvara tradition. 

Since Pabhongkha made fundamental changes to the tradition, Sakya lineage masters will not bestow the uncommon Vajrayogini instructions on someone who has only received the tradition from Pabhongkha lineage. They [meaning HH Sakya Trizin, Jetsun Kusho and others] will require you to receive both a two-day empowerment in Hevajra or Cakrasamvara as well as Vajrayogini blessing from a major Sakya lineage holder as a prerequisite even if you have received these in Gelug.

Also, HH Dalai Lama is not fond of the fact that Vajrayogini has eclipsed more traditional Gelug practices and has stated this.

Title: Re: Buddhism beyond the nation state
Content:
Presently, Buddhism has become a nationalist banner for young Tibetans inside of Tibet, so Gray is mistaken. In fact, under the Chinese hegemony, Buddhism, especially the Nyingma school, has become widely identified with the struggle for Tibetan independence in large part because Nyingma legends are based on the Tibetan Imperial Period -- and in coordination with that is a very popular cult of Gesar as guru, deva and dharmapāla. 

As for westerners who use the sobriquet "Tibetan Buddhism", this is not really nationalistic -- it is connected with the source of the brand i.e. Tibet, as opposed to Japanese Buddhism (Zen, Shingon, Tendai, Nichiren), etc., or Chinese Buddhism (Chan, Pure Land, etc.). 

Many westerners adopt the styles, customs and costumes of the nation their Buddhism derives from: for example, in Zen, Chan, Son, Theravada, Sakya, Kagyu, Nyingma, Gelug etc. They even adopt the individual customs of different sects. 

But this adoption and adaptation is largely free from political overtones. For example, I am sure no western practitioner of Zen really takes the ultra nationalist positions of their Japanese forbears. 

In fact, what I think you are witnessing is merely a phase in adaptation of a regional Buddhist teaching which can be grouped into three rough phases: curiosity; exploration and adoption; maturation and evolution beyond that cultural source of a given teaching. 

Some Tibetans, like Trungpa, tried to build cultural separation from the source culture of his teachings right from the beginning. Most of the Shambhala Buddhists I know are only very dimly aware of Tibet and really do not care much about it. They are not encouraged to learn Tibetan and they are actively discouraged from having direct contact with Tibetan teachers. 

Other Tibetans, like Chagdud, Lama Dawa, etc., are very interested in having their students preserve the uniquely Tibetan forms of the Nyingma school.  

Some other Tibetans, like Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, assert their Dharma teachings is beyond cultural limitations, etc., but maintain separate organizations for the academic study and preservation of aspects of Tibetan cultural knowledge such as medicine, astrology, etc.

So the stereotype you paint here is rather limited and feeble. The forms of Dharma that come from Tibet have been in the West long enough so that now various different organizations are starting to stand on their own without much support from Tibetan institutions. 

In general, those organizations most tied into Tibetan culture are the Gelugs and the Kagyus because they funnel large amounts of money from Taiwan, Europe and the US to monasteries in India.

Indian tantric texts themselves this give triad of teachings, so it is not some invention of Tibetans. If your goal is adherence to some Indian idea of tantric practice, then your best bet is to become educated in the Sakya school's tradition. Four of the five founding masters of Sakya were conversationally fluent in Sanskrit and studied with the great Indian pandits of their day who came to Tibet. As far as the Sakya school is concerned, its early textual tradition is a direct import of 10th/11th century Indian Buddhist tantrism and its procedures and values. Granted, the Sakya school's practices underwent consolidation and streamlining, but is in general very faithful to how things were being done in India during the 10th and 11th century, especially in lower tantra.

In the Tibetan tradition, there are two levels when it comes to tantra -- the ripening empowerment and the liberating instruction. You are not really qualified to practice sadhana without instruction i.e. the liberating instruction. Beyond this, upadeshas are necessary, which define the key points of practice that arise from the experience of realized masters in the lineage. So generally, to be fully equipped to practice in a given Indo-Tibetan practice lineage such as Lamdre, Naro Khachod, etc., (no matter what school) or even Yogatantra such as Sarvavidyā, you need three things: empowerment, instructions and upadeshas.

There is no _path_ of transformation in common Mahāyāna. The method of common Mahāyāna is called the six pāramitās. 

Phenomena remain afflictive even for ārya bodhisattvas until they reach the pure bhumis (8-10). After this point, Bodhisattvas only take rebirth in the so called pure abodes, but this takes two incalculable eons to acheive, and an additional one incalculable one to move through the rest of the bhumis while the last trace of the jñeya-avarana is removed. The kleśa-avarana is removed at the end of the seventh bhumi. 

In other words, there is no rapid method in common Mahāyāna which ensures liberation within one to sixteen lifetimes.

I am surprised you are asking this question. Sexual misconduct is defined by time, place, person and orifice. In terms of persons, it only defines married persons or persons spoken for (i.e. betrothed persons) as well as minors as well as person with whom engaging in sexual activity is inappropriate, such as non-consenting adults, in the case of rape of an adult (given that all sexual contact with minors is considered misconduct). 

Secondly, there are many passages in the tantras which claim that passion can only be removed with passion, just as fire is removed with fire and water is removed with water, for example, in the Hevajra tantra, etc. Many such passages exist. The criteria for differentiating common vs. uncommon Mahayāna, i.e., Secret Mantra, is whether one is in the possession of the proper method or not.

There is no prohibition against having sexual partners outside of marriage even in sütra if one is also not married nor an exhortation to be married, even in sūtra, much less Vajrayāna. 

The non-virtue of sexual misconduct does not mention anything about freely consenting free adults having relations with other freely consenting free adults. Further, alcohol is not mentioned amongst the ten non-virtues at all. 

And, if you have a proper method, wine and sexual partners are not a problem (nowhere did I imply multiple sexual partners -- but even that is fine providing the criteria mentioned above is met). 

Finally, Padmasambhava's advice that one's conduct be fine as a grain of sand does not mean following rules; rather, it means being aware of circumstances and acting appropriately at all times.

It is not really that secret at all. 

The origin of the practice is Bari Lotsawa, passed through the Kagyu lineage (Gampopa apparently extended his life with this practice) until it rejoined Sakya during the period of Tsarchen Losal Gyatso. It was one of Khyentse Wangpo's very important practices and he supposedly possessed a thangka of White Tara that could speak. 

It is a very wonderful practice, but it is quite complicated in terms of the visualization. Khyentse Wangpo composed a teaching manual on it, that is spread out over one week or so. 

The essential visualization of the protection cakra is combined into Dzogchen Community Tara practice. So receiving this initiation and practice is a good support for the DC practice.

There are various accounts of Virupa, and they do not all agree in particulars -- for example, one version of the mālā story holds that he threw his mālā away because he became realized. Also, there is a pun in Sanskrit that few people notice: the waste products of the body are called "mala"; a rosary is called a mālā. So when Shri Dharmapāla threw his mālā in the mala, he was making a statement about his realization i.e. since he had overcome his mala, he no longer needed his mālā. 

You really need to read Rin po che ljong shing if you really want to understand the Tantric path of the Sakyapa school. In that book you will discover that in Vajrayāna (according to the Sakya school) there are three grades of heat (weak, medium, strong) on the path of application (rather than four grades as in sūtra i.e. heat, peak, etc.). Here, Vajrayāna practitioners are supposed to engage in "unconventional behavior" -- first in the their rooms, etc. 

As for Dzogchen, all I can say is that in general Dzogchen practitioners are not governed by rules at all, there are no vows or samayas to follow in particular, no paths and stages, no particular conduct to adopt or reject. As long as you are not indifferent and mindful, you don't need rules, vows and samayas.

I am maintaining that in the path of renunciation, Mahāyāna included, attachment to those desire objects [of the three realms] is abandoned by abandoning those objects themselves directly. When those objects are abandoned, attachment to them no longer arises i.e. no contact, no sensation; no sensation, no craving. 

In the path of transformation it is a little different. While contact with impure material sense organs with impure material sense objects [all considered part of the upadāna rūpaskandha] results in craving, etc., contact by pure sense organs with pure objects [all transformed into a pure mandala] does not result in craving. 

In the path of self-liberation, there is no need to relinquish or transform anything since [ideally] there is no grasping at all. If there is any grasping [whether internally or externally], self-liberation is not possible. Of course the path of self-liberation is a path, and therefore, there is specific way to train to reach the level of being totally free of grasping.

You are not correctly presenting Loppon Rinpoche's thought:

"The second general topic is the Pāramitāyāna practitioner making that basis into a path by giving it up."
 -- The General Presentation of the Divisions of Tantra folio 12/a. 

Clearly in this treatise he is claiming two things there is a basis to be given up, and he defines that basis as the five desire objects:

"If it is asked what that cause is, it becomes many things when analyzed extensively — aggregates [skandha], elements [dhātu], gateways [āyatana], etc. In brief it is the five kinds of desire objects. If is wondered how is it summarized into five; the creator of samsara and nirvana is the mind. Its objects are six or twelve, but all are just the five [desire objects] themselves and what follows those, apart from which there isn’t anything else. Therefore, these five are the basis." 
-- folio 11/a

He later states:

"... as such, if is wondered whether the basis of samsara and nirvana is shared or separate, it is shared.
Now, if one thinks “Doesn’t the one who wishes nirvana give up the basis? If that is so, [the basis] cannot be shared.”
Indeed, it is true [the basis, i.e. the five desire objects] is given up. Since it is necessary to make [the basis which is] given up itself into an object, since that is so, [the basis] is also proven to be the basis of nirvana."


Thus, your citation (which comes in the section where secret mantra is defined through the fact that is does not give up the basis [the five desire objects]) cannot be understood in the manner in which you are citing it because it directly contradicts the intention of the author, irrespective of what you personally believe to be the intention of Mahāyāna.

Some educational posts on Tibetan History:


"Tibetan intransigence persuaded the British to give up their exploratory mission into Tibet. Instead Britain secured China’s recognition of its military takeover of Burma, and reciprocated by recognizing China’s claim of suzerainty over Tibet.

Tibetans were deliberately excluded from all the conventions and discussions that took place in those years between the British and China concerning Tibet or Sikkim. In 1893 when the Trade Regulation talks were held in Darjeeling, the Tibetan cabinet sent a senior official, Paljor Dorje Shatra to keep an eye on the proceedings. Shatra’s presence appears to have been resented by the British. Some English subalterns dragged him off his horse and threw him into a public fountain in the Chowrasta square."

http://www.jamyangnorbu.com/blog/2013/0 ... dependence


"Tibetans can legitimately view the events from 1876 to 1904 as the first chapter in their modern history. Most accounts of this period, largely written by British officials or scholars tend to downplay native resistance and patriotism and ascribe them instead to Tibetan religious fanaticism."

http://www.jamyangnorbu.com/blog/2013/0 ... dependence

"Academic scholarship may not generally lend itself to moving or inspirational writing, but there are exceptions. Edward Gibbon’s, The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, is probably the greatest work of history written in the English language (Hugh Trevor-Roper) and a literary masterpiece praised for its narrative clarity, biting irony and elegant prose. It was a book that woke people up to a whole new way of viewing antiquity, especially in relation to the development of religious institutions – the Christian church in particular.  It was also the defining work of history that came out of the European Enlightenment.

Tsepon Wangchuk Deden Shakabpa’s Advanced Political History of Tibet deals with events, places and personalities that have, of course, less resonance or significance to the rest of the world, especially at the moment when China is being hailed internationally as the next global superpower, and the issue of Tibet has been relegated to a kind of oblivion, more distant and inconsequential (it sometimes appears) than a chariot race at the Hippodrome in ancient Constantinople."

The point of taking a vow of celibacy is not to allow contact of your penis with a vagina., etc. 

Anyway, I could spend my time and find many citations that prove that in terms of Mahāyāna view and conduct, the five desire objects themselves are something to be abandoned for many reasons, some having to do with becoming free from attachment, others having to do with the developing samadhi, etc. But I am going to stop here because I have clearly made my point about why Mahāyāna and Vajrayāna differ on the point of eliminating contact with desire objects themselves.

You are totally missing the point. We are discussing why Mahāyāna is a path of renunciation. We are not discussing integration in terms of how that is presented in Dzogchen teachings, not at all. Mahāyāna conduct is completely based on abandoning sense objects, as we can see from many citations. It is critical to understand this point. 

When we say that Mahāyāna is a path of renunciation, we are saying we are abandoning the five desire objects, because that is how we are going to abandon attachment to them.  The Vajrayāna path of transformation exists for people who are too weak to abandon the five desire objects because their craving is so strong. 

It is really simple: the links of dependent origination in this life function in this way --&gt; contact [sparśa] --&gt; sensation [vedana] -- craving [tṛṣṇā] --&gt; addiction [upādāna] --&gt;

The easiest way stop craving is to sever contact with a given sense object, for example, an alcoholic and alcohol.

Śariputra: likewise, bodhisattva mahāsattvas welled trained in the illusions of Mahāyāna attain the experience of illusory phenomena. Though free from all afflictions, they enjoy the five desire objects [pañcakāmaguṇa] from the perspective of great compassion in order to ripen sentient beings to be disciplined, but they do not associate with those [five desire objects], they are not moved by those. 

Śariputra: bodhisattva mahāsattvas describe the faults of desire objects with many similes: desire objects are a conflagration. Desire objects are totally inferior. Desire objects are murderers. Desire objects are  enemies. Desire objects are invaders. Desire objects are like straw huts. Desire objects are like the kimpakā fruit. Desire objects are like the edge of a razor. Desire objects are like cinders. Desire objects are like poison leaves. Desire objects are like sparrows. Desire objects are like cesspools. 

As such, Śariputra, though bodhisattva mahāsattvas comprehend desire objects thoroughly, for the purpose of ripening sentient beings who lack skillful means, [they] are remorseful from the five desire objects, and in order to free those [sentient beings] from the five desire objects, [bodhisattva mahāsattvas] expound upon [the faults] of the five desire objects in detail. 

-- Śatasāhasrika-prajñāpāramitā

The point, dear friends, is that in Mahāyāna, just as in Śravakayāna, order to give up attachment to the five desire objects, the five desire objects themselves are given up as part of the path. This is why in Vajrayāna tradition, common Mahāyāna [as opposed to uncommon Mahāyāna Vajrayāna] is clearly described as a path of renunciation because it is a path of renunciation. 

Honestly, why is this so hard to understand?

This is not a refutation of my point. This is merely an sectarian observation that standard presentation of the śravaka path is not a path that results in the generation of full buddhahood. 

As for your other points -- the path of Mahāyāna really no different than that of śravakayāna -- and is a path based on the renunciation of sense objects and has no other path than that. 

You can dance on books all day and you will never alter this fact. I can give you a hundred citations from the very sutras and texts you cite [that the bodhisattva path is path of renouncing sense objects], and still you will never retreat from your point of view. 

It is good that you are devoted to prajñāpāramitā, but the pāramitā path just a path of renouncing sense objects. 

I will leave it here — The Sāgaramatiparipṛcchā-sūtra states:

"Bodhisattvas who possess prajñā are to be reproached about the accumulation of merit; without the method, they do not endeavor in generosity, discipline, patience, diligence and concentration. They indulge in proliferation, thinking ‘the perfection of prajñā is extraordinarily supreme, the other perfections are inferior’."

I did not do the former. Where Jeff and I disagree is that over whether the basic rules of monastics can be altered. I don't think so. 

If you don't want to follow all the rules of a Bhikṣu as best as you can -- then don't become a bhikṣu, that is what I am saying. Indrajala is basically saying that he feels that the only ordination that is necessary is the śramanera or novice ordination. He is also saying Vinaya should be revised to reflect that. 

There is certainly an avenue for people to only receive the dge tshul ordination. Many very high lamas only ordain up to that level, for example. But I don't think the Vinaya rules should be revised, and it is unlikely they will be in Theravada and Mulasarvastivada since that would require a council of Vinayadharas and I just don't think it will happen (as it shouldn't).

Really? 

The Vajrapañjara-tantra states:
Created by passion, the worldly
shall be liberated by the same passion.

 Śrī Guhyasamāja
The passionate desiring wisdom
always rely on the five desire objects

Śrī Hevajra-tantra states: 
The savage actions of people
bring bondage by such and such;
If one possesses the method, by just those [actions] 
one shall be liberated from the bondage of becoming

Śrī Guhyasamāja:
All the desired pleasures
are what one serves with desire; 
make offerings to oneself and others
with the yoga of oneself as the deity

You don't change afflictions, you train in pure vision. By slowly transforming your vision, since ordinary vision is caused by afflictions which generate concepts, counteract that with sadhana practice, completion stage etc. 

As The Hevajra states:
Since the poison has been eliminated by purification,
these objects to be relied upon are reliable

You use afflictions just as they are, but by changing how you relate to the world, by transforming your world, slowly you realize the state of Mahāmudra without giving anything up at all.

Vows are intentions. We don't need the theory of avijñāpti, etc. When you take a vow, you make an intention to follow that vow. Except, apparently in this day and age, people take vows with no intention of following them at all.

To be a Dharma person, the essence of vinaya is non-harming, the essence of Mahāyāna is bodhicitta, and the essence of Vajrayāna is pure vision -- one does not need to take many vows at all follow this -- but if someone takes vows, they should try to follow them. If they can't follow them, they should not take them.

It is unrealistic for lay people (and even bhikṣus) to abandon sense pleasures in this day and age, therefore, it is best to use a method where sense pleasures are used for one's own purposes as part of the path, hence the reason for the Vajrayāna path of transformation. Of course if you do not have Vajrayāna methods you try and be free from accepting and rejecting ala Chan and Zen, but that is a slow path since it lacks skill methods, from a Vajrayāna perspective. 

I should add, no one takes desire [or the other afflictions] as a path except for people who wish to continue to cycle in samsara. One can take sense objects into the path through using the sadhana method if you did not achieve liberation through receiving empowerment.

While I applaud your idealism, the reality is harsh. There simply is not enough support for Western monastics, and the large scale experiments thus far, FPMT, etc., have been marked by spectacular failure for the most part. 

I really think that monasticism of virtually every kind is a fading institution because most people do not see it as relevant -- part of this has to do with the dominant Protestant-based culture of the US and northern Europe.

It can't be economically efficient. 

Monastics, in Buddhadharma, by definition are dependent on others for everything. Monastics are forbidden to dig in the ground, so they cannot feed themselves. They are forbidden to handle money, so they really ought not work. In fact, monasticism, of the Buddhist variety, is pretty unsustainable. 

In fact, the economic burden imposed by the enormous plethora of monastics in the early period of Śakyamuni's Dharma was one of the reasons Ashoka cracked down and assisted the Vaibhajyavadins in "defrocking" many thousands of monks. Having homeless mendicants creates a financial burden that most western communities are not interested in supporting and in reality, cannot support. 

Support of the monastic community in Buddhadharma arises from the belief that one will accumulated merit by supporting monastics. There are simply not enough western Buddhists to effectively do so in the West. And frankly, most dana given by Westerners goes into gold for statues and stupas, not into the support of monastics.

There is renunciation, the wish to be free from samsara. That is one thing. Then there are paths of renunciation, where for example, you follow many rules about what and who you can touch, and what and who you cannot touch and so on, what you should wear, what you should wear. 

The former [renunciation] is necessary in every path, and especially it is necessary in the Kali Yuga.

Look around, it is not like there are thousands of arhats, or first stage bodhisattvas. We are not in India in the Pre-Gupta phase, when realization was relatively easy. 

We are at the stale end of the dispensation of Śākyamuni. Hell, most [Mahāyāna] people here don't even believe the texts they follow were actually authored by the historical Buddha. 

95% of all the westerners that really try to do the Bhikṣu thing give back their vows. It is a little different with bhikṣunis, because they are more ideologically motivated [which is also not exactly renunciation]. 

As a great Sakya master put it "What's the use of the cutting the hair on your head if you can't cut the woolly mess of concepts?"

I know a lot of bhikṣus -- and every last one of them is worldly and lacks renunciation. Not one of them lives according to Vinaya. It is different in Theravada, of course. But that is ethnic Buddhism, as far as the bhikku Sangha goes -- and even then, renunciation is in short supply in Theravadin monasteries as well.

Desire objects are not confined to sex. Bodhisattvas in Mahāyāna training are not supposed to enjoy any sense objects for their own benefit, only if it will benefit others. The general attitude in Mahāyāna towards sense objects is illustrated by Candragomin:

Objects and poisons are alike, their result is unpleasant and unbearable.

Nonsense, Tibet was a victim of several factors: western colonial policy, specifically, Britain's presence in India. Tibet was also subject to Qing dynasty in the 18th and 19th century, who poisoned several Dalai Lamas to maintain control over Lhasa (there was a lot of money in the Tibetan salt and tea trades). The Qing deliberately kept the Lhasa government weak and under their control. The primary reason that Kham and Amdo were not under the Lhasa Gvt., is that they were territories of China from the early 18th century onward, not because Khams was filled with bandits. 

In fact, it was the 13th Dalai Lama who threw off the shackles of the Qing (which is why he is considered a hero) and tried to modernize the army and so on without success.

A Mahāyāna monk (or layperson) is someone who, in addition to Pratimokṣa vows, also has Bodhisattva vows. A Vajrayāna monk (or layperson) additionally has samaya vows. Where the lower vows contradict the higher vows, one follows the higher vows.

The fact that virtually all late Indian Vajrayāna tantras and transmissions, as well as late Mahayāna developments such as the Abhisamaya-alaṃkara tradition, etc., are absent everywhere but in Tibet, Nepal and Mongolia means that no other tradition has all paths taught in India. Thus, the statement can be read as a true statement. It does not mean that other Mahayana traditions do not present a complete path to Buddhahood, it just means that in Tibetan Buddhism one has available all paths that have ever been taught under the rubric of "Buddhism". That cannot be said of any other tradition. It is a simple fact.

Tibetan Buddhism contains the complete path for awakening for every single conceivable layer of the development of Buddhism in Buddhist history, Hīnayāna, Mahāyāna and Mantrayāna (including a few developments, such as Dzogchen that do not at all exist outside of Tibetan Buddhism). That is what is meant by "complete". 

No one intends by complete that Tibetans translated every Indian text. We know this because the record of eminent translators mention that there were many sutras, tantras, and so on that were not translated in Tibetan, such as the Kalacakra in 500,00 lines; The Hevajra Tantra in 500,00 lines, and so on. So obviously, Tibetans themselves are aware that they did not manage to translate every text. But what they were able to bring to Tibet was a complete path path covering all three yānas (as defined from a 8th--10th century Indian Vajrayāna perspective). Yes, of course, we all known including Tibetans, that Tibetan Buddhism was a snapshot of late medieval Indian Buddhist culture during its decline phase. 

Further, Merely bringing Abhidharmakosha, Abhisamaya-alaṃkara and one Tantra say, Kalacakra, would constitute a complete transmission of Indian Buddhism.

The origins of Dzogchen are given in the man ngag sde tantras, mainly the sgra thal gyur and its commentary. The account of the origins of Dzogchen is mythological in scope and involve the twelve teachers prior to Garab Dorje. AFAIK, ChNN takes this account literally, as fact. His twist, if you will, is adding the name of Tonpa Shenrab to that list as a Dzogchen nirmanakāya. This is not without precedent in Nyingma, since as you will recall Guru Chowang also asserts that Tonpa Shenrab is a nirmanakāya who taught the liberative vehicles as well in his gter 'byung che.

Of course, most of the people here talking about Dzogchen have little or no facility in Tibetan, and therefore, are quite limited in their scope. 

These days, the definitive read on Dzogchen is held to be Longchenpa's four treasuries of the dharmadhātu, reality, subjects and supreme vehicle. Dzogchen is a very precise teaching and in this end, even when people disagree about the best method of pedagogy, they do not disagree about meaning.

They wanted to question him on the basis of their misunderstanding of a point of history he had explained in one of his books i.e. that Tonpa Shenrab existed before both Shakyamuni and Garab Dorje, and therefore, they concluded he, ChNN was stating that Dzogchen has its origin in Bon. Of course ChNN explained to them to the history of the 12 ancient masters of Dzogchgen beginning with Nangwa Dampa, who are much more ancient than Tonpa Shenrab. 

The three, abashed, then requested Dzogchen teachings from ChNN, who replied to the effect he does not teach Dzogchen to people who come to debate with him about.

(Leaving aside Zen, which is actually more widespread than Vajrayāna Dharma), Vajrayāna is more popular because it promotes liberation in a single body and a single lifetime.

Yes, you have read books influenced completely by a post-14th century read on Indian Tenet systems. 

For example, the eleventh century Nyingam scholar, Rongzom Chozang, writes in his seminal intro to Mahayāna systems:

When the Yogacara assert the characteristic of emptiness of dualistic false conceptualities, emptiness is not asserted to be anything other than the other dependent. 


Or:

Also in the system of the Yogacāra, the mind and mental factors of the three realms, the characteristic of the falsely imagined is not an object and also is not a subject, [6/a] but a tenet system of being the characteristic of a mere self-reflexive cognition empty of both [subject and object] is asserted. 

And then he includes a paraphrase from Asanga's Mahayānasaṃgraha to support his assertion. 

Or, when summarizing their final view:

When the [Yogacāra] tenets are summarized, all [schools of Yogacāra] claim “Non-conceptual primordial wisdom possessing the suchness of being empty of duality substantially exists as ultimate.

Thus, your claim that Tsongkhapa was the first to marginalize Yogacāra as cittamatra is shown to be unfounded. Also Sakya Pandita demonstrates the same thing as Rongzom. 


Or Kawa Paltseg's lta ba'i rim pa bshad pa, written in the later 8th or early 9th century places Vijñaptimatra [i.e. Yogacāra/Cittamatra] below Madhyamaka:

The vehicle of characteristics has three divisions:
Vijñaptimatra; Yogacara
and Sautrantika Madhyamaka. 
The Vijñaptimatrins assert that [the appearance of] a man of [a misperceived] cairn
does not exist like bamboo horse, 
the deluded appearance of one's own consciousness;
assert that the ultimate is a moment of wisdom;
and are in accord with Yogacāra Mādhyamika [in terms of] the relative.
[But Mādhyamikas] assert the ultimate as non-arisen emptiness,
and the Sautrantika [Mādhyamikas] assert the relative as mere illusion,
seen as appearing from the perspective of the object. 
Since it is sublime, freedom from the two extremes
is asserted to be great Madhyamaka. 


Now, the difference between Yogacara Madhyamaka, formulated by Shantaraksita and so called Sautrantika Madhyamaka (meaning Buddhapalita, Bhavaveka, etc.) was well known at this time. But Yogacara itself was considered inferior to Madhyamaka, and Yogacara, Vijñaptimatra and Cittamatra were all considered syonyms in Tibet up until the time Dolbupa. 

This text, incidentally, gives the first appearance of the term "dbu ma chen po" that we know of. 

So it is just wrong to claim that Tsongkhapa was the one who "margianalizes" Yogacara as cittamatra.

For key terms my glossaries will contain definitions derived from original and ancient Dzogchen commentaries themselves. My method is to base myself on how these terms are actually defined in Tibetan by the ancient masters as much as possible. While I will not be providing the texts themselves, my translations contain references to the Tibetan page number on every page, so someone with some facility in Tibetan can go and look in the original and see how I have translated something.  

Like many practitioners of Dzogchen I study "Kama" and pratice terma. 

I do not spend much time on later Dzogchen texts because they are all 100 percent derivative of ancient texts. About as modern as I get is the 14th century in general. Everything in Dzogchen has completely developed by that time. Longchenpa is not really at all original in terms of Dzogchen. He merely represents the culmination of the development of snying thig tradition, some might argue he is the fruit of that tradition. 

In terms of actual content, there is nothing original in Dzogchen following the revelation of the Mkha' 'gro snying thig by Tsultrim Dorje in the early 14th century (which is notable mainly for the way it combines anuyoga into Dzogchen, not because it is especially novel in comparison with the Vima snying thig). Everything that follows is just restatement, a defense against polemics or a minor clarification.

It was only after the 14th century that a rennovated "Yogacara" was presented by some Tibetan scholars such as Dolbupa, etc. Prior to this, in general, Tibetans in general considered Yogacara "cittamatra". I can provide numerous examples going back to the 8th century.

gnas lugs renders two Sanskrit terms: bhutatā and tattva, for example Longchenpa's famed gnas lugs rin po che mdzod is given a Sanskrit title by him: tattvaratnakośa. I do not know why translators from Tibetan persist in translating "gnas lugs" as "way of abiding". Thus it is pretty clear the title of the text ought to be translated "Treasury of Precious Reality". 

Gnas lugs in this context simply means "reality". 

Ālaya and gnas lugs are equivalent in Mahāmudra teachings in both Kagyu and Sakya.

The third sense of gnas lugs, often overlooked, is "anatomy", for example, when we talk about the rtsa'i gnas lugs i.e. the anatomy of the channels, and so on.
