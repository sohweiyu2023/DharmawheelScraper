The point being that Dzogchen practice does not involve the two stages. Dzogchen practitioners might have various reasons to resort to practices from the lower vehicles, for example, keeping the fifth precept if they have a problem with alcohol.

And don’t forget Shri Simha being quoted by Manjushrikirti as being part of a group that dismissed the creation stage as being unnecessary, or for the timid, since the necessity of that is really what we are discussing.

You are confusing Dzogchen practice with Dzogchen practitioners. Dzogchen practice does not entail sadhana practice, though many practitioners practice anuyoga sadhanas, etc., and even maintain monastic vows, because we don’t use Dzogchen as a limitation.

ChNN made it quite clear that Dzogchen was a stand alone path, not an add on to Vajrayana. He never taught pujas as absolute requirements or samayas. He did, as you say, teach many Dzogchen adjacent cycles, as supports, in keeping with Manjushrimitra’s observation that there is also an indirect path of dzogchen through symbols. But he always maintained Dzogchen is an independent vehicle, entirely self-sufficient and complete, like the other nine yanas.

Many teachers maintain lineages they don’t primarily practice because they contain important teachings. For example, Guhyagarbha has an important chapter on Dzogchen, chapter 13. That does not mean that Vimalamitra’s path was Guhyagarbha. Vimalamitra primarily spent his time practicing rushen, trekcho, and thogal. 

There are also lineages of Yamantaka, Zhitro, etc., that descend from Garab Dorje, but he wasn’t practicing these. He didn’t need to.

One must make a distinction between practicing deity yoga as a complete path as opposed to using deity yoga for temporary benefits, like removing obstacles, life extension, and so on. One can use the two stages as a complete path, however that is not the path of Dzogchen proper. 

The distinction is between employing sems as the path or ye shes as the path. The former is based on concepts, the latter is based direct perception.
