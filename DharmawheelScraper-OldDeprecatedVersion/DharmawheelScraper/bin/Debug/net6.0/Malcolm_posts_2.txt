It is quite possible to give a lot of instructions on Dzogchen teachings, while at the same time discouraging people from practicing them until they reach some imaginary level. 

Garab Dorje never said "practice a lot of śamatha, then practice vipaśyāna, and then maybe you will be ready for direct introduction." He also never said, "practice prostrations, then bodhicitta, then vajrasattva, etc."

There are many different versions of the song of the vajra. ChNN said he had collected more than 20. 

But the Song of the Vajra is the essential practice of Dzogchen Community. ChNN told me personally that it was his main practice. 

The version we use is virtually identical to the one presented by Longchenpa in the link you provide, and the minor differences can easily be accounted for as scribal errors. This SOV is called "The nondual transcendent state of Samantbhadra and Samantabhadra. In other transmissions, Samantabhadra and Samantabhadri each have their own, slightly different version. 

Since the version we use comes from ChNN's dreams, he wrote it down exactly as he heard it over many different years and in many different transmissions in his dreams. Therefore, we consider it authoritative. But that does not mean the other versions are invalid. They are all valid because they come from slightly different transmissions. 

The melody we use is unique to him, and when he asked his uncles about it Tibet, before he went into exile, they did not know the melody that we use today. Adzom Drukpa however, used to sing it, but his melody was quite different than one ChNN heard in his dream when he was a boy. 

We can understand the importance of SOV because it is the main mantra of the liberation through wearing tantras, and because it used in many Ganapujas related to Dzogchen teachings, for example the Zhitro Ganapuja in the Gongpa Zangthal, etc.

Was actually written by Costantino Albini, not by ChNN, thought it was edited out of retreat materials. In any case, it is just an approach to the four samadhis of sems sde. Even so, it depends on direct introduction. Also, properly understood "released śamatha" is just the second stage, mi g.yp ba, not moving, which is the integration of movement with stillness. Actually, though these things are presented as gradual, the four samadhis of the Kham system of sems sde are not actually gradual, just as the four symbols of klong sde are not gradual, and the four equipoises of man ngag sde are not gradual. All three series depend on working with the transmission of direct introduction. If someone is teaching about Dzogchen without giving their students introduction, then what their students are practicing is not Dzogchen at all, not even a little bit, this is axiomatic.

Nevertheless, his students think it is is a prerequisite and have told me he insists on it in his retreats. There are people out there trying achieve perfect śamatha in retreat because they believe that is what BAW wants before moving on to Dzogchen. There must be a reason why so many of them think this and act accordingly, right? 

In any case, I am just reflecting what Longchenpa says and what my own gurus have taught in relationship to that. People are free to do what they want and follow who they want. It's not like achieving perfect śamatha according to the middle Bhāvanakrma is a bad thing, it just isn't Dzogchen at all.

All you need to do is look over these transcripts, and you can see that BAW clearly insists that one must, as a preliminary, focus on perfecting śamatha. 

But this is not the path of Dzogchen and it never has been. Longchenpa again:

Here, the special path of the essential core (snying thig) is superior in five ways to the common meditations employed as the path: (1) There is no distinction between sharp and dull in faculties because vidyā is nakedly realized. (2) There is no dependence on analytical wisdom because pellucidity is directly realized by one’s sense organs. (3) There is no hope for meaning in intellectualism and rhetoric because vidyā that is beyond words is realized to be pellucid. {420} (4) Other than whatever appears as positive and negative delusions, there is no basis for confident clinging and grasping to appearances because the three kāyas are realized to be path appearances. (5) View, meditation, conduct, and result are seen as obscurations of vidyā because naked vidyā is pellucid. Therefore, since there is no basis for confidence in the śamatha and vipaśyanā of the repose of a calm mind, [the path of the essential core] is superior. 

And the Sound Tantra:

There are neither dull nor sharp in capacity.

There are three essential books you need to have to understand ChNN's presentation of Dzogchen: the Guruyoga book; the Precious Vase, and the Song of the Vajra book. Now that you have received transmission from YSN, you can purchase these books and learn from them. Many Dzogchen practices such as the separation of samsara and nirvana as well as the semzins can be practiced with no further required transmissions other than a direct introduction. So now it is up to you. You practice these things, you gain some experience, and then you will have something to ask about. In the meantime, without some experience, you will not have any real valid questions. First things first, however. Learn Song of the Vajra. It is the supreme method of discovering your real nature.

The term semzin is a translation of the term dharāṇa, as as it sounds, it is a prelude to dhyāna and samādhi. 

There are twenty-one semzins mentioned explicitly in the the Dzogchen tantras and there is a smaller subset identified by . They are divided into three groups: the first group of seven are for placing the mind in a calm state; the second group of seven are for parting mind and body; and the third group of seven are for entering into dharmatā. Then there is rushan practice. But as I already mentioned, Longchenpa criticizes the approach of normative śamatha and vipaśyanā, which is object-bases. You might object, the semzins are object based as well. However, the semszin are structured in a logical sequence which indeed is more efficient, and allow one to easily discover the natural dhyāna of rig pa, which after all is the point. 

This is far more effective than trying to achieve perfect śamatha, which is still based in mind, and is without any method of nakedly exposing rig pa.

If it isn't trekchö, it isn't Dzogchen. A beginner's practice should be focused on developing trekchö, systematically using the semzins and rushans. Sure, one can also apply Dzogchen view to the cultivation of the first dhyāna or also deity yoga using the six limb approach, but in reality, klong sde and man ngag sde are faster and more certain than these sems sde approaches.

The idea that one needs to spend months and years on developing śamatha according the middle Bhāvanakrama of Kamalaśila is misguided, from the point of view of Longchenpa. Longchenpa very specifically criticizes this approach in chapter 10 of the autocommentary of the Treasury of the Dharmadhātu.

This has nothing to do with what you agree or disagree with Jules. There is considerable room for improvement in your understanding of Dzogchen. For example, are you going to disagree with Vimalamitra when he states:

Thus, ignorance (ma rig pa) depends on knowledge (rig pa) and delusion depends on nondelusion. As such, knowledge (rig pa) itself becomes ignorance (ma rig pa) and nondelusion becomes delusion.

Or the Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra, pg. 196

Ignorance (ma rig pa) is realized essentially to be knowledge (rig pa);
concepts are realized to be the state of dharmatā;
the five attachments and aversions are the five pristine
consciousnesses;
the five objects are realized as the pure five lights..

Or, on page 274:

Vidyā (which can neither be clarified nor obscured)
and (the various appearances of) ignorance
are inseparable, realized to be one entity.

Or page 286:

Both knowledge (rig pa) and ignorance (ma rig pa) are also concepts of grasping.

Or page 354:

“The example for vidyā and ignorance is the form of water and ripples—
depending on conditions.

Other examples that are used for rig pa and ma rig pa being the same entity are water and ice, etc. 

At the time when the basis stirred, Samantabhadra never entered into delusion, but in the first moment, he experienced ignorance—the ignorance of the same identical cause and the connate ignorance. Khenpo Ngachung affirms this in his notes on Nyoshul Khenpo's thogal teaching, folio 17/a, when Nyoshul Khenpo discusses the liberation of Samantabhadra: "Both of those [ignorances] existed for Samantabhadra, but wisdom (prajñā) arose at that juncture."

The whole point of Dzogchen is to understand how ignorance arose and how to reverse that process. You keep on inventing artificial criteria which are not reflected in the tradition and certainly are not consistent with how my teachers have taught Dzogchen teachings. Since I don't want to insult your teachers, I can only conclude that you have not studied hard enough and have been content with a superficial understanding the subject.
