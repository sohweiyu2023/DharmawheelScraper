To what is this awareness intrinsic? 

The term rang gi rig pa means "own's own vidyā", one's own knowledge." 

It is used this way again and again in hundreds of Dzogchen texts written in Tibetan. Some western translators got a hold of the term, and with no justification whatsoever, decided that the "rang gi" meant "intrinsic", and "rig pa" meant "awareness." Now, rig pa can, in certain contexts, be translated as awareness, but not universally, and not in this context. 

Rig pa, vidyā, knowledge, is paired against ma rig pa, avidyā, ignorance. Knowledge or ignorance of what? One's own nature, the basis, essence, nature and compassion/energy.

Well, China is not the navel of the world.

Your argument runs as follows, "The Chinese did write about it, therefore it did not exist." 

Tibet was of interest to China solely because Tibetans threatened their interests on the Silk Road. Other than that, China had no interest in the Tibetans, this, more than anything else, explains the lack of mention of Tibetan in Chinese annals. 

This is not the case with "Khotan, Samarkand, Koguryo, Japan and SE Asian nations..." where China had active trade interests.

As for Tibetan Ministers, well, they were soldiers; and even in the time of the 5th Dalai Lama, there were certain kinds of animal sacrifices done in Lhasa. This does not mean that the population as a whole were not interested in Dharma.

There is no doubt that Tri srong De'u bstan [742-797] was a Buddhist king. He built Samye, etc. 

This idea that something only valid if there is an external source is a little silly. It means for example, the Spanish are the only arbiters what we may know about Mexican civilization. 

What are the external checks on the Chinese Civilization? According to your theory, all of Chinese history is suspect since unless there is external corroboration of something in a foreign source.

Everyone has some insights, that does not make them qualified to teach Dzogchen or even Vajrayāna. 

It is not easy to be a teacher —&nbsp;this means you are responsible for your students progress. 

There are still a few really qualified teachers of Dzogchen around such as Chogyal Namkhai Norbu. Why waste your time with anything less? I know Jax's point of view very well —&nbsp;he constantly criticizes Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, he does not like Song of the Vajra, Vajra dance as well as the secondary practices that ChNN communicates, etc. This merely demonstrates something about Jax and nothing at all about ChNN's teachings. 

Anyone can write a nice book about Dzogchen —&nbsp;its words are very easy to understand and fun to repeat. But there is a difference between a Dzogchen master like Chogyal Namkhai Norbu and someone like Jax. You can observe this in their conduct and activity. CHNN never expresses anything but respect for his own teachers and others. Jax puts himself on a pedestal and likes to criticize people who he has taken teachings from without cause. This speaks volumes.

The Bonpos assert that Tibetan script is derived from Zhang zhung smar script, from around 100 BCE. Given that Tibetans engaged on one of the most amazing cultural self-immolations during the 9th century, and given considerable evidence that Tibetans were familiar with writing prior the 7th century based on their being a vassal state of Zhang Zhung, disregarding for a moment the origin of Zhang Zhung smar script, the Tibetans certainly knew what writing was at a very early date. 

The idea that Thonmi Sambhota "invented" Tibetan writing is an error. He adapted an earlier system based on his exposure to Sanskrit. It is likely therefore that while in general Bhrami must have formed the basis for all scripts in Zhang Zhung and Tibet, it is very hasty to claim that writing did not exist in Tibet prior to the 7th century, especially given the clear accounts of the books of Bonpos being burned by Buddhists during the late eighth century from both sides.

The intiation text connected with the 13 Golden Dharmas states very clearly that Avalokiteshvara bounds Ganapati under samaya, and threatened to split his head open if he disobeyed and did not adopt the three trainings (discipline, samadhi and wisdom). This initiation text explicitly refers to Ganapati as a 'jig rten pa, i.e. a worldly one. 

The account of Ganapati in the book, dam can bstan srung gi rnam rthar composed by the 18th century savant, sle lung bshad pa rdo rje, repeats the account in the above text, nearly word for word. 

Based on this, we can see that it is generally considered that Ganapati is a worldly protector bound under oaths.

You are really missing the point. When you observe anger arise in your mind, as a Vajrayāna practitioner, this is understood to be wisdom. It is not "turned" into wisdom, it always was. Such afflictions are poison because they are not recognized —&nbsp;when they are recognized, they have no power, and therefore, one does not act in ways that produce karma. This Vajrayāna method is very indirect, because it requires a lot of conceptual effort, but in principle it is the same as the the idea of liberation through recognition in Dzogchen. 

For example, you become angry, but if you are a Vajrayāna practitioner, you cannot be angry at your own mandala, so when you apply the practice "all appearances are the deity" this cuts the force of anger.

One has to very precise, because different Dzogchen texts say different things depending on context. 

The problem is that some people attempt to explain Dzogchen without understanding the principle of different texts and series, and so make a sort of stew of things. 

Another problem is the modern intellectual fad of considering the bodhicitta texts such as five earlier lungs translated by Vairocana to be the "authentic original" or "radical" Dzogchen. 

As you said, it is better to find an authentic master such as ChNN, Loppon Tenzin Namdag, etc.

Title: Re: Dzogchen & Vipashyana on thoughts
Content:
The problem here is mostly around definitions.

What is meant by "mind"? What is meant by "awareness?" What is meant by "wisdom."

One can certainly find many Dzogchen texts that assert mind and wisdom are mutually exclusive. For example, one of the texts in the Pellucid Transcendent State of Samantabhadra cycle declares:

The general dharma systems assert buddhahood for the mind. The system of the Pellucid Transcendent State of the Great Perfection does not assert buddhahood in the mind. The mind is the basis of accumulating various traces. Buddhahood is self-originate pristine consciousness [rang byung ye shes] that is free from thought. There is no place for traces to accumulate in the pristine consciousness that is free from thought.

It then cites a text called Molten Silver:

Observe the mind with the mind, there isn’t anything to see;
likewise, even though the nature of the mind is understood to be empty, this is not buddhahood;
that removes afflictions, but does not increase wisdom.
Hoping for buddhahood in the mind is like a feather being carried by the wind. 

It finally distinguishes that mind and pristine consciousness [ye shes] have different results:

The results are not the same: the mind is mounted on the vāyu, and the mental concepts of the merged vāyu and mind move wildly. An undercurrent of concepts arise, accumulating as an undercurrent of traces. The present cause of birth in samsara is always engaging in the dualism of an apprehended object and an apprehending subject through combining both mind and the breath. Since one possesses a mind of an apprehended object and an apprehending subject, concepts arise in the mind. Since various concepts proliferate, temporary concepts arose. Since the five poisonous afflictions arose in the mind, they increased to eighty-four thousand. Since concepts proliferate in the mind, in every instant of time, one hundred concepts arise and on hundred cease. Therefore, the wheel of suffering is uninterrupted. The result is the ripening of the three lower realms.

Pristine consciousness self-originates from the beginning, is without breath, is pellucid, free from the mind, limpidly clear, non-conceptual and completely blissful. Since it is without arising and ceasing, it does not move. Clear in uniformity, unchanging and uninterrupted, clarity and non-conceptuality, bliss and emptiness are the same. The result is self-appearing perfect buddhahood.

So, one needs to be careful.

Pretty much everyone in Tibet, including common people. I mean look, just examine the bio of Milarepa —&nbsp;what was he famous for? Rites for summoning hail connected with the planetary god, Rahula. Everyone in Tibet knows this, it is part of the common culture. 

Wrathful rituals to dispatch demons as well as enemies are part and parcel of Tibetan religious life. There was a whole class of ritualists called Sogdogpas whose main job was ritually repelling Mongolians. 

Rites known as Zor, which translates to something in modern parlance like "magical bomb," but literally means "sickle" or "scythe", are very popular. They are popular because people believe they work. 

There is for example in Gelug history, the example of using abhicara rites to kill one of the Karmapas before he had a chance to reach the Chinese emperor.  A famed Gelug master was concerned that if the Karmapa as allowed to reach the Qing emperor, , things would be bad for the fortune of the Gelug school. 

There is much less erotica in Tibetan Vajrayāna than its Indian forbear, because the Tibetans were rather prudish, but have a rather violent character and are pretty war-like. They have just sublimated most of their aggression into religious and business pursuits, and they are self-consciously aware of this to a high degree.

Yes, there is the rnam thar of Virupa, which while committed to writing in the late 12th century, certainly was communicated orally from the mid 11th. There is the songs of Jetsun Dragpa Gyaltsen which make fun of going to pilgrimage to Bodhgaya since a) it is controlled by Hindus, and b) one is likely to be murdered by hostile hill tribes on the way. 

Also the 12th century bio of Padmasambhava reports a great deal of hostility between Hindus and Buddhists, and the stories of the 84 mahāsiddhas are full of magical battles between Hindus and Buddhists. There is even the 13th century confrontation between Harananda and Sakya Pandita. In short, Tibetans knew very well that India was a hostile place for Buddhists, which is why they largely ceased going there for anything other than trade purposes by the 13th century. They also received regular reports of Hindu hostilities from refugee Indian Buddhists who frequently took refuge in Tibet as late as the 15th century. 

Generally these accounts —&nbsp;dating from the 11th through 13th century — portray Buddhism as being under siege by wicked Hindu Kings, with accounts of violence, sorcery and contests.

The explanation of the symbolic import of abhicarya rites and so on was confined to mundane practitioners who had not achieved siddhi.

However, the criteria for being able to engage of rites of liberation on more than a symbolic level requires that the practitioner be a siddhi in fact. You should examine the story of Virupa, as his tale has the largest number of hostile and violent interactions with Hindus.

Title: Re: Definition(s) of "non-dual"
Content:
In Madhyamaka, ultimately there is no duality because neither existence nor nonexistence, self and other, etc. is established in the ultimate. 

However, the final statement, "they are able to destroy the self-grasping in the minds of others"  is not consistent with the premise, "because they have realized emptiness, they know that a duality of self and others does not exist."

Further, there is the added problem —&nbsp;Buddhas have realized everything to realize, and have abandoned everything to abandon, they have perfect compassion which is unlimited. For what reason then have they not destroyed self-grasping that exists in the mind of all sentient beings? Therefore, I don't think that this statement above can be taken seriously. It also contradicts the statement of the Buddha:

Misdeeds cannot be washed away by water,
the suffering of living beings cannot be removed with the hand,
my realization cannot transferred to another,
but by showing the true nature of things, there will be liberation.

This is not how things are presented in Dzogchen, or for that matter in Sakya or Nyingma. In both Sakya and Nyingma for example, the nirmanakāya is not considered to be the "Teacher". There is only one teacher, Buddha Samantabhadhra/Vajradhara. This single teacher, the dharmakāya, called Samantabhadra, emanates the Samabhogakāya, in this case Vajradhara, who in turn emanates the nirmanakāyas such as Śākyamuni. I am fairly certain the Kagyus also present things in this way.

If you don't understand the five aggregates, you will never attain buddhahood. Why? Because you will never understand what absence of self really means in any concrete way. 

The four or five elements are phenomenological descriptions of matter (hardness, liquidity, heat, motility and absence of obstruction), they are not considered things in themselves, at least, not in Yogacara on up. 

If you do not understand the five elements, you will not understand the meaning of rūpaskandha. 

Myriads of people do not attain buddhahood.

The point is not whether the description is literally precise in all its details, however, the fact is that it describes an Indo-centric view of the world where Jambudvipa is the southern most continent relative to the landmass of the Himalayas. 

BTW, the four continents and the eight minor continents are all described in the Abhidharmakosha.

It is not a strawman —&nbsp;there is no support at all in sūtra or tantra for the tulku system in Tibetan Buddhism. 

This is a different issue than the general teaching that variegated nirmanakāyas will appear for the benefit of sentient beings. No method for recognizing these is provided in the sūtras and tantras. Why? Because nirmanakāyas know they are nimanakāyas. They do not need a process of confirmation.

The Buddha taught three paths: the path of renunciation which is common to Hinayāna and Mahāyāna; the path of transformation which is general Vajrayāna and the path of self-liberation, which is also termed Atiyoga. 

The principles of the higher paths often seem to contradict the principles of the lower paths, but in reality, they are all aiming at the same point, buddhahood. If someone does not have faith in a path, for example, karmamudra, they should leave it aside and not criticize it, because many masters in India and Tibet have attained complete buddhahood through practicing this path. One should be careful not to criticize Vajrayāna teachings, because one will abandon the Dharma if one does so.

But since this is a sea product, I don't think there is an issue, especially if you get it from a traditional source where it is beach harvested, rather than a fishing byproduct. It is used for kidney heat and illnesses of the brain.

I have no interest in Tibetan cultural reform. We are in agreement that any modifications of Tibetan culture should come from Tibetans, not Americans, Europeans or Chinese people. This however does not prevent us from observing that some Tibetan cultural institutions maybe are not all that they are cracked up to be. 

It is important to recognize however that there are Tibetan cultural practices, like recognizing tulkus, that are not actually part of the Dharma. Can anyone point me to a reference in either sūtra or tantra, Nyingma or Sarma, that says, "In the last 500 years of the Dharma, the only way the Dharma will be preserved is through recognizing small children as the reincarnations of dead masters"? 

The funny thing too is that people somehow believe tulkus get better training than ordinary people. Really, this is a fantasy. The fact is that young tulkus are often put to work at a very young age raising money for their monasteries, and as a result, they often have very inferior training compared with normal scholars in shedras. 

Of course we have to understand that the practice of recognizing tulkus began with the second and third Karmapa, and these masters were fantastic. Then it became a big fashion, and within 200 hundred years, tulkus were being recognized everywhere. 

We also should understand that the 5th Dalai Lama's recognition, by his own account, was completely fraudulent. He was also a fantastic master, but he certainly was not the reincarnation of the fourth Dalai Lama.

The idea that you have to live this hardcore ascetic lifestyle to become a realized person is a myth. You do not need to spend years and years in retreat. I know many people who have spend years and years in retreat and they are just as screwed up now as when they went into retreat, and just as ordinary. I also have done long term intensive retreat (3+ years), and while it was an awesome experience, I certainly did not come out of it a realized person. At least according to my master, there is no need for this. As long as one applies the the teachings in a consistent way to one's life, integrating view, meditation and conduct,  then one will eventually attain realization. Anyway, most of us will attain realization in the bardo, not in this life.

I honestly don't think you will find much of a difference between training people recognized as tulkus and those who are not. Why? Because the vast majority of tulkus are not recognized by realized masters such Togden Urgyen Tenzin.

Basic human decency does not require these romantic fantasies in which you indulge. It merely requires caring for others more than oneself. Countless fools have murdered and caused the murder of others in the name of honor, chivalry and valor. Such romantic fools will continue to do so, sadly.

ChNN in this case is really convinced his son is the reincarnation of his other uncle, the least known Khyentse incarnation. [people should read The Lamp That Enlightens Narrow Minds]. For a while. Yeshe was listed with his father as a teacher in the Community. Then he apparently decided he did not want to be in that role anymore, so he had his name removed. This was after My Reincarnation was aired all over the world. 

Characteristically, ChNN. while confident of his son's "pedigree", chose not to subject him to a monastic education. 

AFAIK, CHNN's son and daughter will inherit the responsibility of continuing their father's legacy. Who knows what it will look like. I have no idea, myself.

Ngondro in Sakya is connected with one's sadhana practice and done within that context, adding mandala and guru yoga in their appropriate places. 

For example, the lengthy Ngondro commentary by twentieth century Nalendra master, Ngalo Khechen, does not present an independent ngondro text, but rather, frames the ngondro recitations within the context of the Hevajra sadhanas, and also includes the manner of doing Ngondro for Naro Khachod, Yamantaka and Tsembupa Chenrezi. According to him, for example, prostrations are better done with the guru yoga accumulation, not refuge. 

Nevertheless, in Sakya, the idea of counting accumulations is a rather modern innovations. In the past, when embarking on a long retreat, one would devote some weeks or months to ngondro. 

Deshung Tulku's ngondro is indeed a modern composition, and is influenced by Kongtrul's ngondro, but it is not the classical way Ngondro in Sakya has been done. 

Ngalo Khenchen's text is highly influenced by Paltrul Rinpoche, containing long passages quoted from kun bzang bla ma'i zhal lung.

In general the tantras of secret mantra do not distinguish between sukra and ojas. However, the principle reason for seminal continence in Vajrayāna practice is that for men, semen is the basis of experiencing a blissful sensation. 

In reality, what one needs to conserve is ojas. ChNN's Birth, LIfe and Death discusses the issue of the difference between semen [khu ba] and ojas [mdangs] in some detail and recommends releasing the former while conserving the latter.

In the Dzogchen intimate instructions, for example, the Khandro Nyinthig, this distinction is fully articulated, and there are techniques for conserving the latter while releasing the former. 

In general, practitioners of Dzogchen do not have to worry about the issue of seminal retention unless they are suffering from ojas depletion [ojas is mainly depleted by stress]. They are more concerned with other kinds of bindus, the "ultimate" ones; not the the ones that come about from eating food.

In Tibetan medicine it is stated that forcefully trying to suppress ejaculation leads to stones and even impotence. So, guys, if you feel it move, it is better to let it go.

Likewise, the five aggregates have always been the five buddhas and so on.

The very meaning of the Tibetan term Dzogchen, "Great Perfection," refers to the true primordial state of every individual and not to any transcendent reality.

My analysis of the problem is precisely the reverses of yours: Most Tibetans cannot grok that we are obsessed with finding something greater or outside ourselves. It is so fundamental to their view, they even call themselves "nang pa", insiders, because they are convinced that the sole cause of all problems in the world come from inside, not from outside.

My point still stands —&nbsp;when one masturbates, one is not harming anyone else, no more than eating food harmful to anyone else. 

The criteria of why the ten nonvirtues are nonvirtuous has to do mainly with how the seven physical nonvirtues impact others around us. 

Masturbation is a transgression only for monastics, while it may be included in sexual misconduct from a preceptual point of view, it has to be considered primarily a transgression of disobedience. Sexual misconduct is a natural transgression because it harms others. Since masturbation does not fulfill this requirement, it is therefore not part of sexual misconduct. These days it is a little hard to justify oral sex and anal sex as sexual misconduct as well, from the natural nonvirtue point of view. I think in general this is why there is just not much heat about it. One does not hear Buddhist teachers railing against fellatio and cunnalingus, etc., in the same way they trip out against eating meat and drinking alcohol...speaking of which it is time for me to go have dinner...

You do not need a source. Do the action of animals cause them to fall into lower realms, yes or no? Animals cannot take precepts, nor train in them, nevertheless their virtuous and nonvirtuous actions have karmic consequences. Therefore all actions are either virtuous, nonvirtuous or neutral, inherently so. 

However, you can understand this from Vasubandhu's discussion of alcohol with regard to lay persons were he makes a distinction between transgressions by nature and transgressions through disobedience. 

We can understand then that the precepts concerning killing, stealing, lying and sexual misconduct are all vows linked with natural nonvirtues, the breaking of which are transgressions by nature  —&nbsp;the rest of Hinayāna Buddhist vows are transgressions through disobedience.

Again, this is not very specific. yes, mouth, anus, etc. 

In short, it is extremely silly to make broad declarations for the Tibetan tradition on the basis of one text by an Indian author which is not supported, AFAICT, in sūtras found in the Tibetan Canon. 

Sexual misconduct should be defined on the basis of conduct that is harmful others. We can see in the instance of minors, those under the protection of others, the spouses of others, in places where public offense will be taken and so on, that there is clear harm to others. But we cannot see this in the case of masturbation. Frankly, it is a little difficult to see how oral sex is harmful to others as long as it is consensual. I would suggest that morays around nonharmful sexual conduct are strictly cultural and may be adjusted to suit cultural climates. In general the ten nonvirtues all depend on how one relates to other sentient beings. It is very easy to see why malice, greed and ignorance are harmful to others, as motivators for killing, stealing, sexual misconduct in general, as well as lying, harsh speech, calumny and gossip. But is very hard to see where consensual sexual acts can fit here as nonvirtues unless one is a monk or a nun.\

What you fail to understand is that the ten nonvirtues are defined as "natural" in so far as it does not matter if you are ant or an anteater. They have nothing to do with trainings, and everything to do with establishing what creates eudaemonic environment for everyone. Precepts are abstracted out of those, and of course, we can understand that consuming alcohol, for lay people, is the only prohibition which is by command, rather than through observing inherency. When you say that masturbation is sexual misconduct, you are making the claim it is inherently nonvirtuous, like killing, stealing, lying and assaulting minors.

Nonsense. For example, Mahāyāna monks may handle gold, but are forbidden to eat meat; Hinayāna monks are barred from handling gold, but may eat meat, and so on it goes. 

Mahayanists may even violate monastic vows without actually losing them, if situations call for it. 

If someone is a Vajrayāna practitioner, then all sense pleasures are acceptable conduct. 

There is no such thing as a universal training which applies to all practitioners.

You have yet to demonstrate that avoiding masturbation, for lay people, is a) a rule for training b) akusala c) not conducive to awakening and conducive to bad rebirth. 

In which hell or preta realm does one take rebirth for masturbating? Why is there complete silence on the issue in Abhidharma?

Why is there complete silence in the issue in sūtra, apart from the one Chinese sūtra you can produce? Maybe it is really not so important.

You seem to fail to understand that these things are not absolutes. The principle of Hinayāna conduct in general is not harming others. You will fail to convince me that masturbation harms others [or oneself for that matter, unless it is a symptom of a pathology]. In this case then, we can really discard the idea that masturbation is sexual misconduct unless of course one does it in public, in front of a Buddharūpa, and so on.

As to your first question, it depends on the understanding and maturity of the practitioner. A 13 year old boy needs different teachings than a 70 year old man. Sutras are like medicine —&nbsp;if one has a specific illness, one applies an appropriate diet, conduct, medicine and therapy. If one has a specific problem, one applies to Buddha's teachings to that problem. But there is no such thing as one teaching that suits every person. 

Your next question can be answered for example, by looking in the Abhidharmakośabhaṣyaṃ. Theravadins for example, do not accept the antarabhāva because they reject the sūtra in which it is taught since it is absent from their own canon. Vasubandhu points that many sūtras have been lost, and then proceeds to argue the point for the antarabhāva on logical grounds. 

I don't generally given much importance to sūtras in the Chinese canon if there is no corresponding Tibetan translation. In fact, I tend to ignore them altogether.

There are many skillful paths for many different people. There is not only one path for everyone.

I think it is pretty clear that Garchen Rinpoche wants students to attend in person or by live webcast. As far as recordings go, I imagine that his thinking runs as follows, "if beginners, new people, want to practice, they can get an idea from watching an online recording, and perhaps there is some positive connection made to the teaching and if they recite the mantra, there is no harm."

But for example, HHDL makes it very clear that watching Kalacakra online does not grant one the empowerment. Also CHNN makes it very clear that empowerments that rely on substances cannot be given via webcast. Other Lamas may have a different ideas about this, but I really think in general all Lamas will agree that there is no way one can receive an empowerment from a recording of an empowerment. I am quite certain, for example, if you wrote ChNN on this subject, he would say very clearly to you that you cannot receive any kind of transmission from a recording. 

And one thing I am pretty clear on is that no one receives empowerments or a lung from a recording.

The terms for Sanskrit and Tibetan respectively are rūpa and gzugs. It is become a common thing for translators to translate rūpaskandha as the "form aggregate", but it is not accurate and does not correspond with the definition of form in English "configuration, formation, structure, construction, arrangement, appearance, exterior, outline, format, layout, design." What does correspond is "matter", i.e. "constituent, raw material, element, component."

When we are taking about the rūpāyatana, the sense base of form, however, the object of the eye, then form is perfect, i.e., "configuration, formation, structure, construction, arrangement, appearance, exterior, outline, format, layout, design."

Words are relative, but they important in that they shape our understanding. If the terms we use are not accurate, how can our understanding be accurate? Geshe Dhargye never thought about these things in English. He did not know English. The fault lies with his translators.

You are completely missing my point. My first point is that no one's qualifications to be a teacher has ever been established or refuted on a board such as Dharmawheel, and so on. My second point is that as long as someone can get some Tibetan to vouch for them, it is very difficult to make an argument that someone is an "inauthentic" teacher. 

Those of us who have studied the actual history of Tibetan Buddhism, such as yourself, should understand that charges of charlatanism are quite wide spread among all four schools. We should also understand that charges of charlatanism have never ever prevented anyone from gathering students, building monasteries, funding stupas, statues, pujas, shedras and so on. The Shugden affair should prove that much to everyone. Do most of us here regard Shugden as inauthentic? Yes? Do most of us here regard teachers who promulgate this practice as inauthentic? Yes. Does that stop Shugdenpas in the slightest? No! The same thing applies to Michael Roach, and other "controversial" teachers. 

Truly, the people who loose the most in this game of authenticity are the self-appointed purveyors of imagined authenticity. In order to question the authenticity of another teacher, first one must prove that one is in fact an arbiter of such authenticity. None of us here can do this. Because of this, accusing this women of being a fraud or a charlatan is a losing game. It is also unfair, and even sexist. 

Honestly, the best practice is that when someone you know personally approaches you in private about this or that teachers credentials, then you can give your opinion —&nbsp;but making a public spectacle out of someone who is regarded as a teacher by others is simple bad form. I know, because I have been involved in this practice in the past and now regard it as folly. 

You will recall that even Chogyur Lingpa in the beginning was derided as a charlatan. It was mainly due to his association with Khyentse Wangpo that his revelations were found acceptable.

Frankly, I have noted a process, repeated often in western organizations, where after building a student base (even if considered charlatans), said organizers are then granted full legitimacy by some Tibetan, sometimes famous, sometimes obscure. 

The process runs as follows; build students, present them to a lineage teacher (with donations to favored charities of course), have the lineage teacher recognize you as the teacher of said group of students, eventually gain recognition as a reincarnation or an emanation (or failing that, just be titled Lama So and So) —&nbsp;boom, you have arrived. Now you can confidently get articles published in Buddhadharma, Shambhala Sun, Tricycle, and land that Harper-Collins book deal you have been craving so that you can crack into the "Barnes &amp; Nobles" Buddhist scene. 

In Tibetan Buddhism, as anywhere else, success is rewarded with accolade and failure is rewarded with obscurity, and it really has very little to do with puritan notions of authenticity, as much as we may wish it to be otherwise.

Title: Re: Mantra Liberation Through Hearing ("Ha Gan Ga")

The reasoning is the same as the following "If one has sufficient faith in some tantra one wants to practice, one can receive the empowerment from the book." This reasoning is condemned by the Buddha in the tantras themselves. The Buddha teaches in the Mahāmudratilaka Tantra:

Without empowerment there is no siddhi,
just as pressing sand yields no oil. 
If someone reveals the tantras and agamas with pride
to those who lack empowerment,
as soon as [both] master and disciple die
they go to hell even if they obtained siddhi. 


The commentary to this tantra, the Śrīguhyārthaprakāśamahādbhūta-nāma, states:

...the disciple upon whom the empowerment is correctly bestowed becomes a suitable vessel for the topics of the profound intimate instructions of the body and so on. Without that however, if the meaning of the tantras is revealed to one who lacks empowerment, it is said the master and the disciple have a root downfall.

One should be very aware of the faults of not receiving empowerment. For example, The Mind Mirror of Vajrasattva Tantra states:

Where will accomplishment be without relying on the empowerments of secret mantra? For example, like a boatman without a paddle, how will one be able to cross to the other side? 

The Self-arisen Vidyā Tantra states:

The faults of not obtaining the empowerment are as follows: in the bardo one is alarmed, panicked, exhausted, impeded, and also one can lose consciousness. 
While one has not left the body of traces, migrating beings will not see one as worthy of respect. One’s merit will be small, one’s life short, one’s enjoyments of living will be few, one will be powerless and many obstacles will occur. Nothing will be accomplished. Those are the faults of not obtaining the empowerment for the practice of Secret Mantra. 

So people who are interested in Vajrayāna should think very carefully about what is valid and what is not valid, one's path depends on it. In this respective, a conservative approach will never harm one.

I think that characterizing Nozick, and for the matter Hayek, as "libertarians" is short-sighted. Certainly libertarians who have misread these two guys have held them up as influences. 

Hayek's main bugaboo is the planned economy, and his main observation is that a planned economy cannot fairly predict all needs, and therefore, it becomes defacto unethical favoritism; whereas in an unplanned economy, the chips fall where they may lay. However, it is not the case that Hayek was completely opposed to regulation, social programs and so on. 

Nozick, it seems, was not very interested in defending his book on any level. Rawls and he were good friends, and I suspect that in Nozick's case, ASU was an intellectual exercise rather than a intellectual commitment. One interesting outcome of his book however, is that he asserts in ASU that we do not have the right to slaughter animals, and he apparently was himself a vegetarian.

Milarepa says in one of his songs that he was stabbed in the chest by Mahāmudra, and stabbed in the back by Dzogchen. 

I am of the personal opinion that Kagyu Mahāmudra as we know it today is largely the creation of Gampopa (following the opinion of the famed 13th century Drugpa Kagyu master, Yang gong pa). 

As far as Longde goes, well, Dzeng Dharmabodhi lived in Lhodrak and had close connections with Kagyus living in that region. In terms of the famous posture of Milarepa, it could either be a Longde posture or the position used in the practice called "vajra waves."

This is not a statement of acceptability. He is taunting the tīrthikas for being afraid. He says in the commentary:

Just as whatever is shown by the term "nonarising" (including its reasoning) will be free from fault, also if you assert [such] a self, the dispute will about a mere name. What conflict will there be with your so called "supreme self" and our "nonarising?"

But he immediately says:

Those terrified of selflessness still dwell in it even though they are terrified;
just as those who are terrified of space have no other place to dwell.

You can see very clearly he really thinks these tīrthikas are idiots for he says in the commentary:

Just as some fools are terrified of and frightened by space, they dwell in that space since no other place is seen [in which to dwell]. In the same way, also those terrified by selflessness, are supported on and dwell in that selflessness because there is no support other than that. 

Honestly, it is really too much to believe that Bhavaviveka has a positive attitude towards these people. He thinks they are both frauds and fools. 

He is basically saying, contrary to your perspective, that by adopting the two truths and adopting the terminology of nonarising, Advaitans are merely arguing themselves into a ridiculous corner where they have no choice but to abandon their concept of para atman. It is not we who are adopting their self, it is they who are adopting our reasoning about the two truths. This is why he earlier castigates them for stealing the teachings of the Tathāgatas and claiming it for themselves.

H. Nakamura holds that Śaṅkarācārya is earlier than Śāntarakṣita, that is, prior to 750 CE. 

As far as your other statement goes, 1) Kamashila specifically identifies this as the position of the Advaitans [གཉིས་མེད་པར་ལྟ་བ], followers of the Upanishads [གསང་བ་པ་རྣམས], i.e. Vedantins. 

There is no substantial difference with what is presented here and Śaṅkarā's thought:


			
		
				
			
						Dakshinamurti-Stotra-With-Manasollasa.tiff (66.63 KiB) Viewed 3160 times
		
		
		
			

15. Consciousness is of two kinds: Nirvikalpaka or the
undifferentiated consciousness illumines the Thing itself,
while Savikalpa or the differentiated consciousness is
manifold as illumining the designations, etc.
http://sacred-texts.com/hin/dast/index.htm

Therefore, when Śāntarakṣita says their error is slight, he actually is saying their error is huge for proposing that consciousness, something impermanent, is permanent. 

One can hardly read this text as any thing other than  refutation of the parama-ātma postulated by Śaṅkarā.

Yes, he says the tīrthikas recognized the value of the Buddha's system of two truths and claimed it for themselves, albeit, fraudulently. So he is not happy about this. He states in the following verse that one should not mistake the two systems, just as one should not mistake a gem composed of metal for a real jewel. He states in the Tarkajvālā [268/ab, (D 3856) dbu ma, dza 40b7-329b4]:

Just as someone claims "a gem made of metal resembles a precious gem", though it's surface is polished, that cannot withstand burning, scratching, grinding and so on. Since they are completely different, whoever is skilled in recognizing precious gems will generate the perception of which is precious. In the same way, since [the tīrthika position of] self, permanence, all pervasivness and oneness contradict their opposite, [the Buddhist position of] no-self, impermanence, non-pervasiveness and multiplicity, they are completely different; the one who is skilled in recognizing reality generates the perception of which is reality. Therefore, it is like showing the tail of the deer to sell horse meat. 

In other words, what Bhavaviveka is saying that the Advaitans fraudulently misrepresent the teaching of the Buddha, and worse, cast it to mean the opposite of what it actually means, using the example of a merchant who displays something of high value to pass off something of no value.

Actually, sometimes "kyi" does not function as a genitive in the sense that we understand it in Latinate grammatical terminology. Here it does not, it sets off a clause. 

Anyway, here 'od gsal is not a gloss for clarity anymore than bde chen is a gloss for bde ba. 

It is a play on words. 

The normal sequence is bde ba, gsal ba, mi rtog pa, not bde chen, 'od 'gsal, mi rtog pa. 

Bde chen, great bliss, is something at the ulimate level, just like 'od gsal, not the level of transient experience like simple bde ba. And mi rtog pa can be either.

The first has no underlying Sanskrit term. But in simple terms it means the imputation of something as real, a fact, and so on, a conventionality because in our everyday perception world this or that seems to function properly. As Madhyamakas, we accept what people say about the world as long as that is not analyzed. We define relative truth fundamentally as a the object of a pre-analytic perception. Ultimate truth, at least the nominal ultimate, is an object of a post-analytic perception, in other words, whatever remains in our perception after analysis is taken to be true, real, irreducible and ultimate. 

Dependent or extrinsic existence (parabhāva) is defined by Nāgārjuna as a species of svabhāva, a deferred svabhāva. Nāgārjuna is observing that there no existence (bhāva) not included in either svabh̄ava or parabhāva. That being the case, when inherent existence is not established, neither is existence and nonexistence.

No one has said that we are confronted with the unreality of phenomena at the get go. No one says that we should be content to merely say "Everything is unreal" and leave it at the level of concept.

Nāgārjuna does not have a position from the tetralemma. He uses it to eliminate all positions. For example, in the Lokātītastava he writes:

There is no arising from self, nor from other; without both how can there be arising?
It is reasonable for an existent to exist, but it is not reasonable for it to perish. 
Since it is reasonable that a nonexistent does not exist, it will never perish. 
It is not reasonable that there is a result from some perished cause,
and there is [no result] from [a cause] that has not perished, therefore, you [the Buddha] have asserted that arising is like a dream.

No need to be confused. For example, the Buddha says in the Ārya-śraddhā-balādhānāvatāra-mudrā-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

Mañjuśrī, furthermore, there are five acquisitions of solace in the purification of the first stage (bhumi) of the bodhisattvas. If it is asked what are the five, they are as follows. There is the acquisition of the solace of "I abide in the knowledge of the middle way inseparable with extremes. I will also place others in the knowledge of middle way inseparable with the extremes. In that regard, the middle way inseparable with extremes is that which is the nature of the extremes because there is no other middle way apart from the nature of the extremes. Since there is no middle way apart from the nature of extremes, the nature of extremes itself is the middle way. Since one knows the middle way of the nature of extremes, all phenomena are the middle way."

There is the acquisition of the solace of "I abide in the knowledge of the space inseparable with the nonbeing of space. I will also place others in the knowledge of space inseparable with the nonbeing of space. In that regard, space inseparable with the nonbeing of space is that which is the nature of the nonbeing of space. If it is asked why that is so, it is because space does not exist apart from the nature of the nonbeing of space. Since there is no space apart from the nature of the nonbeing of space, the nature of the nonbeing of space itself is space. Since one knows space of the nature of nonbeing of space, all phenomena are like space."

There is the acquisition of the solace of "I abide in the knowledge of the child of a barren woman inseparable with the nonbeing of the child of a barren women. I will also place others in the knowledge of the child of a barren woman inseparable with the nonbeing of the child of a barren women. In that regard, the child of a barren woman inseparable with the nonbeing of the child of a barren women is that which is the nature of the nonbeing of child of a barren women. If it is asked why that is so, it is because the child of a barren woman does not exist apart from the nonbeing of the child of a barren woman. Since there is no child of a barren woman apart from the nature of the nonbeing of the child of a barren woman, the nature of the nonbeing of the child of a barren woman itself is the child of a barren woman. Since one knows the child of a barren woman of the nature of the nonbeing of the child of a barren woman, all phenomena are equivalent with child of a barren woman."

There is the acquisition of the solace of "I abide in the knowledge of a mirage inseparable with the nonbeing of the mirage. I will also place others in the knowledge of a mirage inseparable with the nonbeing of the mirage. In that regard, the mirage inseparable with the nonbeing of the mirage is that which is the nature of the nonbeing of the mirage. If it is asked why that is so, it is because the mirage does not exist apart from the nonbeing of the mirage. Since there is no mirage apart from the nature of the nonbeing of the mirage, the nature of the nonbeing of the mirage itself is the mirage. Since one knows the mirage of the nature of the nonbeing of the mirage, all phenomena are like a mirage."

There is the acquisition of the solace of "I abide in the knowledge of right view inseparable with wrong view. I will also place others in the knowledge of right view inseparable with wrong view. In that regard, right view inseparable with wrong view is that which is the nature of wrong view. If it is asked why that is so, it is because right view does not exist apart from nature of wrong view.

I objected to your claim that things were "real" as well as "merely existent" when you responded to my statement "gnas lugs med pa", i.e., there is no reality, no gnas lugs, bhutatā, etc. Saying there is no reality means that when one has examined phenomena, one finds they cannot be found to be real in any sense at all. Phenomena are found to be empty imputations, illusions, dreams, mirages, etc. Haribhadra, the famed 7th century commentator to the Abhisamayālaṃkara stated that everything is illusory, the paths, stages and even buddhahood. 

It may have escaped you, but you are actually arguing that things are not empty. And if you assert that things are merely empty of inherent existence, then what you are arguing is that the ultimate is a nonexistence.

You can say that things are "conventionally real", but this does not help you. Why? Because once again, "conventionally real" amounts to nothing more than the assertion that something is "real" because two sentient beings beings agree on the identity of a shared appearance. And that also does not match now the term is used in English. "Real" in the OED means, "...actually existing as a thing or occurring in fact; not imagined or supposed" or as it is used in Philosophy, "...relating to something as it is, not merely as it may be described or distinguished."

In reality, a thing that is a conventional truth is true only in so far as it is functional. For, there is no "car" in a car. We use a number of parts, assemble them and create something we call a "car", using those parts to perform a function. But when we analyze those parts, we can find no car in them, nor separate from them. The "car" as such does not exist apart from our imputation of a car upon some parts, just as there is no person in the aggregates or separate from them. "Car" and "Malcolm" are imputations of an on a collection of parts and have no reality other than as an imputation. This means that the reality of cars and malcolm's is strictly conventional.

This why conventional truths are relative truths, "concealer truths" if we follow the etymology of samvṛtti, because their real nature is concealed by our deluded perceptions of things.

Truths are cognitions of objects, so yes, the emphasis is on the cognition, nevertheless, the definition is incomplete without including the object. 

For example, a mirage is the object of a deluded cognition of the presence of water in the distance. The perceived object does not exist, and yet it still appears; when that appearance of investigated, no water is found which corresponds to that appearance. 

"...such deluded cognitions perceive objects as existing inherently, whereas they are in fact empty..."

Such a distinction is not made by a worldly person. Worldly people do not think in terms of "inherent existence." 

The problem with Wayfarer's perspective is that he believes that there is something in phenomena that can survive analysis, which he calls "mere existence." In reality, nothing can survive ultimate analysis, not even buddhahood. 

Relatives truths are by definition cognitions of objects which have not been subjected to ultimate analysis. The cognition of any object which can survive ultimate analysis is an ultimate truth. 

The real point is that whatever arises from causes and conditions is cannot survive ultimate analysis. For example, in the Hinayāna presentation of two truths the cognition of a vase is relative truth; when this is shattered with a hammer, the cognition of the shards and so on are ultimate truths. Likewise, the cognition of water is a relative truth; but the cognition of coolness, wetness and limpidity are ultimate truths. 

When this is brought to the level of Madhyamaka, we can see that all things that arise from cause and conditions are equivalent with mirages, dreams, illusions and so on. Just as in a puppet show a bunch of rocks, sticks and paper is made to appear as elephants, warriors and so on through the "mantra" of the illusionist (meaning his narrative), likewise are phenomena appearing through causes and conditions. So too when the it is understood that the illusion is a mere spell cast through skilled manipulation of bits and pieces of rocks, wood, string and so on, one understands that the illusion are unreal, and phenomena are also like this. When the basis of the illusions are investigated, they too are found to arise from causes and conditions and therefore are essentially unreal. There is no end to such analysis because there is no end to deceptive appearances. 

I can't continue since I have to go out of town for a day or so, but I will leave you with this: whatever arises from causes and conditions does not exist in those causes and conditions nor separate from them, just as a self does not exist in the aggregates nor separate from them. Nevertheless, just as things are designated dependent on causes and conditions without really being there, selves are designated dependent on the aggregates without really being there.

It [wisdom] is also relative since it is a cognition and is not a permanent cognition [apart from a buddha's wisdom] and also comes about through causes [which is also true in the case of a buddha's wisdom].

Yes, I understand. The problem with the way you were taught is that you were taught to accept a residuum, called "mere existence," which accounts for your crypto-realism on the one hand, and you were taught to negate something other than the thing before you, which amounts to subtle nihilism because the way you were taught Madhyamaka maintains that an absence is ultimate [the famous non-affirming negation], the absence of inherent existence, i.e., the emptiness which is the absence of the true existence of things, on the other hand. 

Gorampa for example, critiques in detail the subtle nihilism present in the Gelugpa view that you follow, as does Mipham. You should read them both. 

I was taught old timey Madhyamaka that was not corrupted with those new-fangled fifteenth century innovations delivered by a "Mañjuśrī" channeler (Lama Umapa).

I am not stuck on the first extreme, I am not asserting non-existence is the ultimate. The point is that absence of the four extremes, which is ultimate, is not arrived at through a mere assertion, it is arrived at through examination. It is a conclusion, a result of analysis, not a hypothesis about the ultimate (unlike smcj's perspective, which is just a proposition, an proffered theory). It is not an idea you hold in your mind, "Oh the ultimate is free from four extremes." Why? Because when you turn your analysis to the ultimate, no ultimate can be found which is itself free from the four extremes. At the point, your proliferations should cease. As Sapan famously quips, "If there is something beyond the freedom from extremes, that is an extreme."

Yes, there is nominally something to negate, appearances. Nāgārjuna's arguments run in three phases: first, self-arising is negated; then, arising from others is negated; and finally causeless negation is negated. Of these three types of arising, the second is what we conventionally term "arising."

This is why, at the conclusion of the first chapter, Buddhapalita notes:

Because results, conditions, and nonconditions do not exist, descriptions for arising are merely conventional.

Suchness is not established. The Ārya-varmavyūhanirdeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra states:

The dhamadhātu is difficult to imagine,
it does not come or go, 
the dharmadhātu is not the aggregates,
nor the elements or sense bases.
Since there is no place to abandon,
it is unmoving.
The suchness of the dharmadhātu,
it's natural purity, does not exist.

In the same vein, the Mahāsiddha Virupa concludes his Doha:

...the two truths don’t exist in the dharmadhātu, the dharmadhātu does not exist. 

Indeed, the Ārya-ghanavyūha-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra says:

The suchness of all phenomena
arises through power of mutual relation,
the yogins seeing in that way
clearly see it as suchness. 
The perfected nature 
is the dharmatā of phenomena;
all phenomena do not arise
as the substantial entities of the imputed:
empty, insubstantial,
beyond the the extremes of existence and nonexistence, 
similar with illusions and dreams,
like fairy castles,
like opthalmia and like mirages. 

In other words, suchness, here described as the perfected nature, the dharmatā of dharmas, cannot be established apart from those very dharmas. If those very dharmas are not established, how can their suchness be established? When the relative is not found, what ultimate can be said to be established? The two truths are only established from the perspective of we ignorant fools. 

This tendency to reify the ultimate is very pernicious. For this reason, Nāgārjuna clear states in the Sixty Verses of Reasoning:

This pair, samsara and nirvana, does not exist.
Thorough knowledge of samsara is said to be nirvana.

I already stated this before: when one does not propose something as existent, one cannot be accused of being an annihilationist. I have not proposed any claims of non-existent, I have merely removed claims for existing existents, as Buddhapalita remarks in his comments on chapter 5 of the MMK

We do not claim aggregates, sense bases and elements are nonexistent, but we do eliminate the claim that existents exists. 

He also remarks at the end of chapter five:

In order to prove an unknown topic with a known topic: most worldly people say that space does not exist in any way. Thus, partisans claim "All of those proliferations are like space." The intent of such as statement is "All of those are nothing at all." For that reason, it is proven that space is emptiness in order to elucidate the example, "The remaining five elements [dhātus] are equivalent with space."

In other words, in MMK:5 (the analysis of the dhātus), of the six dhātus —&nbsp;earth, water, fire, air, space and consciousness — only space is actually subject to analysis. Why? Since Nāgārjuna shows:

Therefor space is not existent,
it is not non-existent, is not the characterized,
is not a characteristic.
The remaining five elements [dhātus] are equivalent with space

Buddhapalita discusses this passage:

Why is that so? When investigated, the characterized and the characteristic does not exist, and also there is no other existent not included in the characterized and the characteristic. If the existent does not exist, also the non-existent does not exist. Therefor, although space is not existent, it is also not non-existent, although the characterized does not exist, also the characteristic does not exist. Thus, if even a subtle thing called ‘space’ came to be, when counting whether anything in those four [alternatives] is valid, because those four [alternatives] are not [valid], therefor space does not exist. 

For this reason, characterizing the Madhyamaka position that "there is no reality" as annihilationist is inappropriate.

You have just shunted off inherent existence onto something else, a so called dependent existence, which is refuted quite handily by Nāgārjuna in the chapter 15 of the MMK. 

In other words, your view holds that things are real. But how? In what way can things exist? You propose things are not self-sufficient, but when examined, even this dependency cannot be found. Why? Causes do not exist at the same time as their effects, but they also cannot exist apart from the time of their effects. As Nāgārjuna states:

Existents do not arise from existents, 
existents do not arise from non-existents;
nonexistents do not arise from existents,
nonexistents do not arise from nonexistents:
where then is there arising? 

In the end, so called "mere existence" is just a convention, and is not real since such conventions will not bear analysis. If you imagine that there are some existents that can bear analysis, you have not really understood the Buddha's intention.

It was mis-stated, my bad. What I should have said, is that since one cannot find anything in the relative according to any of the four extremes, there is nothing in the ultimate that can be said to be free from the four extremes. In other words, since the four extremes do not exist in the relative, also there is no ultimate free from extremes, and is that is inexpressible. 

The best thing you can say is 'gnas lugs med pa", there is no reality.

The point is, that one cannot say anything about the ultimate that is free from extremes, much less assert that it is immune to Madhyamaka analysis. The moment you make a proposition about the ultimate, you have fallen into an extreme. If you claim the ultimate is atman, that is an extreme; if you claim the ultimate is a nonaffirming negation, that is an extreme; if you claim the ultimate is an affirming negation, that is an extreme. 

When you understand that the ultimate is free from all extremes, then you understand that it is not only beyond mind, it is also inexpressible. The problem with the gzhan stong pas as well as the Gelugpas is that they sound like a couple of kids bickering, "Is so!", "Is not!", ad nauseam. 

Since nothing can be found to exist by any of the four extremes in the relative, nothing can be ascertained in the ultimate according to any of the four extremes, and that is inexpressible.

To say that something is ultimate, irreducible, cannot be analyzed further, is unconditioned, etc. is precisely the same thing as saying "actually exists."

Since nothing in the relative is found to be free of the four extremes, nothing can be found in the ultimate that is free of the four extremes. You are claiming that there is something which is free from the four extremes in the ultimate, but such a claim is incoherent.
