The USA was founded as a slave-owning nation bent on exterminating an indigenous population. From whom did the Chinese get the idea they could do the same? The USA. Concentration camps, systematic genocide, the use of incarcerated labor were all modeled by our country first. 

Our only saving grace is democracy, which has slowly allowed us to transcend these sordid origins. But as Trumpism shows us, our republic is fragile and easily damaged. 

Tibet was an aristocratic autocracy where the nobility could injure the common folk with absolute impunity. There was no justice system, so while a thief might lose a hand or an eye, aristocrats just became more and more wealthy. The amount of child abuse in Tibetan monasteries was staggering, the amount of rape in Tibetan culture was likewise staggering. Murder was very common. Cruelty to animals was commonplace. Literacy was no more than 15 percent of the population. Now, was Tibet an incredible civilization with many redeeming qualities as well? Certainly, but all we see is the literary culture of Tibet. We do not see the Tibet of the average person, whose voices are only rarely heard in the writings of the elite scholars and yogis whom we admire so much.

I appreciate your attempt at an argument, but fact is that Nagarjuna only discusses two truths. There isn’t a single citation from Nagarjuna which you can use to justify such a position. The Buddha himself rejects to idea that there is a third truth. I cited the sutra passage in previous discussion with QQ.

The fourfold negation is not a formulation of three truths. It is a step-by-step negation of erroneous propositions about things. It is not in fact a postulate; Nagarjuna has no postulates. His dialectic is strictly negative. For Nagarjuna, there are only veridical perceptions, or false perceptions. There are no perceptions that are simultaneously true and false. Hence, there is no third truth, punto cerrado.

But I already provided you with your answer: in India, rather than attempting to codify a social ethic, Buddhists typically relied on the treatises, called niti shastras, that already addressed such issues. Likewise, I mentioned that the answers for theses issues will not be found in Buddhism, but rather in a robust formulation of secular ethics, as HH Dalai Lama has indicated in an entire book he wrote on the inadequacy of all religious ethical traditions to deal with social justice issues and so on.

One thing that often goes unrecognized when the idea that Europeans “stole” land from Indians is, as I mention above, the fact that European and Native concepts of “property” were completely unintelligible to each other. It is certainly the case that Europeans dispossessed, displaced, and often exterminated Native people, but the history of this is far more complicated than a simple reductionist trope. It’s also somewhat off topic for a discussion of Buddhist ethical theory,

Buddhist ethical theory is about personal conduct, and is not equipped or even intended to address issues such such large-scale, generational social justice issues. This is not to say that a Buddhist should not adress them, but there is virtually no guidance here from the Buddha.

In this respect Western discourse on ethics is more apt.

This set the stage for the eventual decline of bhikṣu ordination and the Ritsu school, so that within 500 years, there were no bhikṣus left in Japan. Eison revived bhikṣu ordination by ordaining himself since there was no valid ordination lineage left in Shingon.

It part of a progression that begins with mental focus (sems zin), concentration (dhyāna, bsam gtan), and samādhi (ting nge 'dzin). Translators try to deal with this usage in a variety of ways, none of which really capture the meaning, including my equivalent, "transcendent state" (from samati = dgongs pa). 

The term dgongs pa can mean intention, but in regular Tibetan, it is commonly just an honorific for mind/thought (sems).

I would revise that order, considering that more commentaries were written in India on the 8000 and 25000 line sutras than any other single text. There are no Indian commentaries on the Avatamska, etc., other than the Dasabhumika chapter, attributed to Nāgārjuna.

But the 10,000 line sūtra was published on 84000, so there is that.

So yes, the Geklukpas are saying nothing truly exists, and that things exist merely on a conventional level, which cannot withstand ultimate analysis.

They are not meaningless, they are merely conventional, with nothing ultimate holding them together.

What ties a stream together over infinite lifetimes from beginningless time is the false grasping at the aggregates as "I and mine." Nothing more is needed to account for the beginningless and endless (until awakening) series of births. After awakening of course, since the three kāyas are inseparable and because sentient beings are endless, buddhas do not abide in nirvana but continue to aid sentient beings in samsara for as long as there is a samsara.

His polemics against other buddhists are chapters 4 and 5, śrāvakas and yogacārins respectively.  

Following his polemics against Vedantins, he then goes after Mimamsa in chapter 10. Vaiṣesika is negated in 7 and 8, Samkhya in 6. He offers his proof of a buddha's omniscience in 11. Chapters 1-3 lay out his vision of Buddhist practice.

You either have the karmic disposition for Vajrayana or you don’t. And if you don’t it takes two asamkhyakalpas to hit the eighth bhumi, and one more for buddhahood. 

If you don’t receive Vajrayana empowerment there are no extraordinary means in sutra by which you might attain even the path of seeing in this life, and that is not related to guru devotion. There is no sutra that teaches guru devotion as a cause for rapid attainment of buddhahood, despite the encouragement to venerate teachers. It’s just part of general merit accumulation. So if you were a Vajrayani in a past life, but did not meet Vajrayana in this life (through lack of merit, since this is the only reason one would fail to meet Vajrayana again), there are no means by which you can “ride the fumes” of your past life practice of Vajrayana to realization in this life.

Empowerments taken in past lives are not a valid basis for practice in this one. Of the three vows, two are lost at death: personal liberation vows and samaya vows. 

No empowerment, no guru; no guru, no samaya. Claiming one is doing Vajrayana practice when one has not received empowerment is like claiming one is bhikshu without having received ordination.

The gnosis aroused by guru yoga depends on the introduction of the fourth empowerment. Without it, the seed of that gnosis is not planted. 

But those faithful students who persevered certainly received empowerments eventually, or at least they created a positive dharma link. 

The fruit of guru yoga is the realization of the great perfection or mahāmudra. Without introduction or empowerment, I very much doubt the necessary ground has been prepared nor the seeds planted to result in either fruit. 

I don't mean to be harsh, but for a tradition which holds up samaya all the time as being the foundation of the path, people seem to disregard it a lot based in this or that justification.

As it says in the Ornament of Mahāmudra Tantra:

Without empowerment there are no siddhis, 
like pressing sand for oil. 
Whoever explains the tantras and the upadeśas 
to those without empowerment,
both master and disciple
go to hell, even if siddhis have been obtained. 


Now, I am quite sure that even though there were those in the 70's and 80's who did ngondros and so on without empowerment, they received little if no explanation of the tantric subjects prior to being properly ripened. So, not I don't think you were being hoodwinked, I think you were being tested to see if you were serious.

Sorry, Japan just isn't that special in this regard. 25 to 50 million of those people lived in Europe. That's slightly less than six million people a year in various parts of Europe.

There isn't much literature that isn't more racist than the Mahāvamsa, the telling of the Buddhist subjugation of the indigenous population of Śṛī Lanka in the second century BCE by King Dutugamunu, but Rama's war against Ravana and his cannibal legions predates it by many centuries, how many, we just don't know, perhaps around 1,000 BCE. Supposedly, the earliest portions of the Ramayāna date from around 700-500 BCE. 

However, by the time such myths arrived in Tibet they have been so divorced from actual historical content, that their racism does not exist for Tibetans, who considered themselves, in one telling, to be descendants of srin pos and monkeys.

Why did Buddhism die out in India?

Anyway, all evidence suggests that anthropologically, rakṣasas were a tribe of ocean-going cannibals. They used to be the dominant people in Śṛī Lanka, before they were all exterminated from that island by Indians. The mythos of Ravana, Dasagriva being defeated and the rakṣasas being driven out is a deep Indian cultural trope, not confined to Hindus, but very prevalent in Buddhist sources as well. 

One interesting factoid: the language of Madagascar has only one cognate language in the world——the language of the headhunters of Borneo. 

Madagascar was colonized by Indians during the 8th century, who established colonies of Indian merchants on the island. Templeman speculates it was they who hired him to tame the indigenous people, known to us as "rakṣasa."

Northern Afghanistan used to be Shambhala. There isn't Buddhism there anymore either...

All that is negated in the Gelug presentation is svabhava,  not bhava, meaning that for them, the ultimate is a nonexistent and the relative is an existent. They never directly negate the table, only the table”s svabhava.

Tsongkhapa’s point of view is laid out very clearly in Lam Rim Chen mo. What I am saying is noncontroversial

In fact, Tsongkhapa makes this the key point of his system, claiming that one should  not use the coarse object of negation, existence (contra Candra), and only the subtle object of negation, inherent existence. This why his view slides towards the extreme of nonexistence, just as gzhan stong slides towards the extreme of existence, and is why the two positions are reflections of each other,

The Karma Kagyu school was put down much harder than Jonang, much harder, as a result of the defeat of the Karma Kagyu king of Tsang, who teamed up with eastern Tibetan bonpos in his attempt to overthrow the Lhasa gvt.. You should really read some detailed accounts of Tibetan history in the 17th century. It just so happens that the king of Tsang, Karma Tenkyong, also was a patron of Jonang. Arguably, the Sakyas escaped similar monastic censure in Western Tibet because of their distance and prestige. The Nyingmapas experienced an increase in fortunes during the same period, due to the patronage of the Great 5th. What is salient here is that gzhan stong was quite popular with Nyingmapas in Central Tibet, but no effort was effort made to suppress Lochen Dharmashri’s works, because his patron was the Fifth Dalai Lama.

That is not correct. The Gelugpas would install a number of Gelug monks at rival monasteries within the administrative reach of the Lhasa gvt. So, Jonang and Gelug monks, or Sakya and Gelug monks, etc., would inhabit the same monasteries, each practicing their own tradition. What is true is that in Central Tibet, block prints of Taranatha, Dolbupa, Gorampa, the Karmapa, etc, any one who criticized Tsongkhapa were locked up and forbidden to be printed. Thus however did not prevent the distribution of manuscripts. The actual situation on the ground was far more complicated than your simplistic assessment would indicate.

Definitely not. It seems to me you do not understand the term "bodhicitta" in its Mahāyāna context. In its Mahāyāna context is means the aspiration for awakening. It also has two subdivisions: relative bodhicitta and ultimate bodhicitta. Relative bodhicitta has two components: aspirational bodhicitta and engaged bodhicitta. Aspirational bodhicitta is the wish to attain buddhahood for the benefit of all beings. Engaged bodhicitta is the practice of the six perfections.  

Ultimate bodhicitta also has two components: the path and the result. The path consists of śamatha, or calm abiding meditation; and vipaśyanā, or insight. The result is the realization of ultimate truth: all phenomena, including nirvana, buddhas, etc., lack inherent existence.

Sanskrit literally means "refined language." Prakrit literally means "natural language."

Knowledge of Sanskrit was a marker of social class and educational attainment and the language was taught mainly to members of the higher castes, through close analysis of Sanskrit grammarians such as Pāṇini. Sanskrit, as the learned language of Ancient India, thus existed alongside the Prakrits (vernaculars), which evolved into the modern Indo-Aryan languages (Hindi, Nepali, Assamese, Marathi, Konkani, Urdu, and Bengali)."

Yes. As Mañjuśṛī said to Sachen, 

If you are attached to this life, you are not a Dharma practitioner. 
If you are attached to samsara, renunciation is lacking. 
If you are attached to your own goals, bodhicitta is lacking.
If grasping arises, the view is lacking.

Is that transpersonal gnosis dual or nondual? If it is the former, it cannot be an ultimate gnosis since it is dualistic; if it is the latter, dualistic appearances cannot appear within a nondual gnosis. Further, if dualistic appearances are manifesting in this gnosis, like reflections in a mirror, it must be a personal gnosis (as suggested by the term pratyatmyavedanajñāna, i.e. the gnosis that one intuits individually), rather than a transpersonal gnosis, because if it were a transpersonal gnosis everyone would experience it at the same time just as it was, and buddhahood would be impossible. If it is a personal gnosis, then dualistic outer appearances can manifest to it, without that gnosis becoming dualistic, and without outer, dependently-originated, apparent phenomena being "mind only." And this is what is means to say that all appearances are included in sugatagarbha, which is just the gnosis that one intuits individually (look it up). There is a difference between appearances and apparent objects, even in gzhan stong. Appearances are like the moon in the water, apparent objects are like the moon. No moon, no reflection; no water, no reflection. 

I suggest you stop tying yourself up in conundrums and go study these things in a proper way. Your self-study is just confusing you.

Caittas do not create cittas; cittas and caittas arise together and support one another. A citta arises when there is sensory contact with an object, either physical or mental. For example, when the eye organ and a form meet, there is an eye consciousness. When the mental organ and a caitta meet, there is a mental consciousness, etc. caittas are the objects of a citta. That’s how caittas support cittas.

So, 1) given that causes and effects are neither the same nor are they different, for example, milk and its curds; 2) given that moments are partless; and 3) given that nothing can arise from a single cause; and further, 4) given that when moment of mind ceases there nothing to prevent the arising of the subsequent moment of mind, your qualm is removed.

Any philosophical position necessarily entails a proposition concerning existence or nonexistence. I have never made a proposition concerning either.

Relinquishing views is not about relinquishing appearances. Further, without relying on conventional truth, one cannot understand ultimate truth. And if one does not understand ultimate truth, nirvana cannot be realized. So what is ultimate truth? Dependently originated things are empty. Empty of what? Extremes of existence and nonexistence.  What are views? Views concern existence and nonexistence. What cures them? Dependent origination. But your view constantly argues for the existence of this and the nonexistence of that. Therefore, you are not free from views. It’s why you spend so much time arguing and advocating for a view. You set up the pins, I knock them down. When you are free from views then you will stop setting up the pins and the game will be over.

The difference between you and the OP is that you clearly wanted to change your view, and understood already that you did not have correct view. So you tried to discover that. 

But in general, I would not recommend that people who do not understand the basics of Mahāyāna Buddhism seek to enter Vajrayāna right away. Otherwise, people who try to practice Vajrayāna without a correct view of emptiness simply wind up taking rebirth as rudras, they either negate cause and result because they have an annihilationist view, or they negate cause and result because they have an eternalist view. But you are talking to someone who wept when first reading the Perfection of Wisdom sūtras, and whose hair stood on end when hearing the word "śunyatā."

Wrong view here specifically refers to not accepting dependent origination and karma with its results. 

There is also wrong devotion. What is that? Devotion which lacks wisdom is wrong devotion. Wisdom does not arise from outside oneself. 

As Nāgārjuna says:

Only those with the essentials of emptiness and compassion
accomplish awakening.

View is the basis of the path. WIthout a correct view, it is impossible for one's path to be correct.

It is not even possible to practice any Vajrayāna sadhana if one lacks conviction in emptiness. How can one practice Vajrayāna methods if one lacks confidence in Vajrayāna view? It is not necessary to be a Prasangika. It is simply necessary to have conviction in emptiness ala the Heat Sūtra. That is sufficient. 

Basically, if one reads the Heart Sūtra and is freaked out by it, rejects its message and so on, one is not a candidate for receiving Vajrayāna teachings, any Vajrayāna teachings, including Dzogchen.  

Buddha spoke about three gates of liberation: signlessness, emptiness, and wishlessness. He did not mention a fourth anywhere.

Well, no. He can't. Why? It is very simple. To take the vows of refuge, you have to abandon nonbuddhist teachers, which the OP clearly is unable to do. To take the bodhisattva vows, not only is one not to make a serious study of nonbuddhist tenets, but also one is supposed to avoid spending too much time on Hinayāna tenets and scriptures. And when it comes to Vajrayāna, wrong view is actually a root downfall, that is, abandoning the view of freedom from extremes. 

Telling this man he can become a Vajrayāna Buddhist without relinquishing his wrong views is like giving him a plane ticket for a nonstop flight to the hell realms. It is completely irresponsible, idiot compassion.

As for the first point: you don't really seem to understand the perspective of vows in Buddhism. A vow you make up yourself is not actually considered right discipline. It is a discipline, sure, but it is not connected with the eight fold path of noble ones.  

As for the second point, I addressed that. When you make offerings to a monastic, you are not really making offerings to a person; you are making offerings to an ideal—that people can awaken through the practice of discipline, samadhi, and wisdom. 

The Sangha represents that ideal. 

I suspect you have not studied these issues carefully, based on your answers. Clearly, at this point in your life, becoming Buddhist monk, a member of the ordained Sangha, is not for you.

First, one does not make these vows silently, in one’s head. There is no self-ordination in Buddhadharma, not even to become an upasaka.

You receive vows in specific rites, which vary from order to order, while the general outline is the same. 

Second, the object is free of affliction. Now, while today monastics are probably not even stream entrants, they still represent arhats. As such, they are representative of the Buddha’s Noble Sangha. 

But no one would argue there was no merit to supporting undernourished children, but not as much. Why? One has no idea how that person will turn out. The Sangha jewel is only virtuous.

It is only Vajrayāna that the example/ultimate wisdom pointed out/realized at the time of empowerment takes precedence over intellectual analysis. When this is realized, it is called mahāmudra or dzogchen. When one is a Vajrayāna practitioner, it does not matter much which intellectual view one subscribes to, whether Madhyamaka or Yogacāra, since the view at the time of the empowerment experienced is a correct, experiential Madhyamaka view. By practicing Vajrayāna practices such as the two stages, and so on, one cultivates this experiential view for a long while, eventually leading its realization.

Only if one accepts what religious hierarchs assert as true by mere fiat. 

I do however agree with the Karmapa in this respect, and I have said it before: Maitreya wrote treatises covering three distinct trends in Mahāyāna Buddhism: Prajñāpāramita, Yogācāra, and Tathāgatagarbha.  However, it is pretty clear that in his synthesis of these three trends, the Ornament of Mahāyāna Sūtras, that the tathāgatagarbha doctrines takes a serious backseat, as it is mentioned but once, not only in his root text, but also in the commentary by Vasubandhu and Shtiramati. 

Then there is the issue of whether the Uttaratantra was even written by Maitreya at all, and whether the commentary of Asanga was actually composed by him as well. And if it is the case that these texts were not written by Maitryea and Asanga (certainly the Chinese reception of these texts cast doubt on this), then the whole edifice the Extrinsic Emptiness proponents erect their arguments upon collapses because it is based on false authorial assumptions. I have already shown elsewhere that the convenient fiction of three turnings was of absolutely no interest to Indians writing on these subjects, and that there is no consensus about this idea among Tibetans. 

The fact is that the Yogacarins also took the Prajñāpāramitā sūtras and the Madhyamaka of Nāgārjuna to be definitive—for example, Asanga receives no prediction in the Lanka, only Nāgārjuna—and merely faulted so-called mādhyamikas for being nihilistic. Indeed, one of their most famous scholars, Dharmapāla, wrote a commentary on Āryadeva's 400, not to fault Āryadeva, but to show that mādhyamikas (such as Buddhapalita and Bhavaviveka) were not understanding the father and son Madhyamaka correctly. And of course then we have the example of the 11th century paṇḍita and polymath, Ratnakāraśanti, whose Madhyamakālaṃkāra (referred to by Tibetans as the sems tsam rgyan) tries to reconcile Nagārjuna with Maitreya and Asanga. The colophon of this translation itself contains a rare, vituperative polemic aimed at followers of Candrakīrti. 

I should also add, that Candrakīrti spends a fair amount of time trying to correct Yogacāra misunderstandings of their own terminology in such texts as the Introduction to Madhyamaka and its autocommentary.

A big green worm with rolling eyes
Crawls in your stomach and out your eyes
Your stomach turns a slimy green
And puss comes out like whipping cream

The ones that crawl out are fat and stout
Your eyes fall in and your hair falls out
Your brain comes tumbling down your snout

Your chest caves in and your eyes pop out
Your brain turns to saurkraut

That is the main point. Where they differ is in the posited result: one asserts a sort of intellectual recognition of the unity of all phenomena in an underlying ground; the other asserts merely that all sentient beings possess from the beginning the ultimate qualities of buddhahood, with for a moment suggesting there is some universal underlying ground at all. In this way, we can understand that while there are structural similarities between Advaita and Extrinsic Emptiness, the former is completely nonbuddhist, while the latter is a transitional school between Yogacāra and Madhyamaka in its attempt to reconcile the inner contradiction in the Yogacāra doctrine with Nāgārjuna's Madhyamaka.

The positions of Advaita and Extrinsic Emptiness are structurally similar, in so far as they both posit an utterly real ultimate in which the utterly unreal relative does not exist. 

Madhyamaka by contrast, merely argues that relative things are ultimately empty, without suggesting there is some ultimate reality that exists to be established beyond the emptiness of relative entities.

Part of the difference between the two is the tradition of tshad ma each master followed. Tsongkhapa followed the epistemological school of Sangphu founded by Phyapa with its complicated system of blo rigs; Gorampa followed Sapan, who rejected the former system in its entirety in his Treasury of Authority (tshad ma rigs gter). Sapan further asserted that Buddhist epistemology was of no value in liberation. 

The fundamental difference between Tsongkhapa and Gorampa boils down to simple difference of opinion over whether or not one is to give precedence to the object of cognition or the cognition. Chandrakirti remarks that all dharmas bear two natures, one ultimate and one relative. He then goes on to say that relative truths are objects of mistaken cognitions; while ultimate truths are objects of veridical cognitions. The Gelukpas stress the former, that is the object; the Sakyapas stress the former, the cognition. When it comes to faithfulness to the Indian treatises, Gorampa wins hands down, IMO. The vast majority of Gorampa's arguments concern how Tsongkhapa is overriding, through reasonings, the plain intent of the Indian masters—indeed, at one point, Gorampa basically faults Tsongkhapa for over-finessing many points needlessly. But of course, it is just this finesse that Geluks celebrate in Tsongkhapa's writings. 

I encourage you to study the Indian masters before getting wrapped up in Tibetan polemics about Madhyamaka. Then, once you have gained complete familiarity with the Indian masters, then return to the Tibetan masters and see with whom you agree.

Also, Thakchoe is a Gelukpa, his sentiments are plainly polemical and he does not really read Gorampa objectively. Gendun Chophel's presentation of Madhyamaka in Madman's Middle Way is far more objective.

As a long time Vajrayāna practitioner, I have to tell you this is something of a misconception.

The rest of the time, we try to maintain as pure a view of our guru as we can, understand the flaws we see to be impure vision. But keep in mind, as a Vajrayāna practitioner, we are also supposed to have a pure view of all sentient beings, not only our teacher.

Holding up western historiography as the pinnacle of human intellectual culture is basically racist. Thus kind of historiography erases indigenous traditions and sensibilities because it is predicated on dominance, as I mentioned before. So it is to be resisted because it is harmful to our tradition, since this kind of historiography insists that only one set of facts can be accepted.

The above argument is extremely silly and barely tenuous. The notion of lineages was carried from India to Tibet, China, and Central Asia by subcontinental Buddhists, principally by Vajrayana practitioners such as Amoghavajra, but also monastic abbots. Everyone seems to forget that in 845, a Taoist empower destroyed 200,000 Buddhist temples, and sent up millions of texts in flames. Relying on the sparsity of Dunhuang to prove anything definitive about Buddhist history in China shows a paucity of reason and is at best specious. A better argument for the survival of the southern school is that it was in the southern hinterlands and so escaped suppression.

If you wish to measure the validity of your practice through the erasures necessitated by adopting a settler colonialist perspective on Buddhist history, go ahead. But I think you will find that such histories are mainly concerned with coercion and the assertion of dominance and power over their subjects, and not really "facts." The very way you posed the question shows this, "but at least some level of recognition of the need to be able to communicate Buddhism on the highest levels of human intellectual culture of our times would be beneficial."

Amitabha is a nirmāṇakāya, with respect to Sukhāvati. His identification of being the dharmakāya is a Vajrayāna doctrine, connected with the 
lotus buddhafamily of Guru Rinpoche: Amitabha is considered to be the dharmakāya; Avalokiteśvara is considered to be the sambhogakāya; and Guru Rinpoche is considered to be the nirmāṇakāya. But this is inapplicable to this discussion, since Amitabha being discussed here is the nirmāṇakāya.

This does not mean they were accurately translated. In fact, in this early period, when Saṃghavarman was working, the third century CE, translation into Chinese was still in its infancy. Given that we have a Sanskrit version that the Tibetan reflects very well, it casts doubt on the accuracy of the Samghavarman's translation on this point. We would need to compare it with later translations of the same text to see if there is a correspondence with other recensions of the text.

Thus, Amitabha also actually attains buddhahood in Akaniṣṭha Ghanavyūha. Further, unlike Sukhāvati, Ghanavyūha has no śrāvakas, since even arhats have afflictive obscurations. There is a great deal more that could be said about this.

But to summarize, there is no justification at all in commonly accepted scriptures for your two central claims: 1) "[Y]ou are learning from the Dharmakāya itself;" 2)"[It] is instantaneous and beyond the need for methods that can be calculated in the normal sense of duration and ascension." 

As to your comment on your two citation, "In East Asian Pure Land thought, there are nirmāṇakāya aspects to Sukhāvatī but it is inseparable from dharmakāya." 

This is unsupportable as well: the first contradiction is that if Sukhāvati is nondual with the dharmakāya, then the dharmakāya must be compounded, because beings take birth there. The second contradition is that If Sukhavāti is nondual with the dharmakāya, then it is impossible for sentient beings to attain birth there, and the aspirations of Bodhisattva Dipaṃkāra cannot be fulfilled. Both of these negative consequences arise from asserting that Sukhāvati something more than a nirmāṇakāya buddhafield. In fact, that whole point of Sukhāvati is that it is a nirmāṇakāya buddhafield, because 1) all learned people understand that even noble bodhisattvas from the seventh stage on down cannot see the sambhogakāya, must less those of us on the paths of accumulation and application, and because 2) not even bodhisattvas on the pure stages can perceive the dharmakāya since they have remaining knowledge obscurations. Since Dipaṃkāra's vows are specifically aimed at ordinary sentient beings, it is simply an exaggeration to make the two claims you have made, since they lack a basis in scripture and they cannot be defended with reason. 

These rebuttals should not be seen as a negation of Bodhisattva Dipaṃkāra's vows, nor should they be seen as a rebuttal of the aspiration to attain rebirth in Sukhāvati. Rather, they are merely proffered in order to correct misconceptions that birth in Sukhāvati is somehow a short cut to buddhahood—it is not—or that birth in Sukhāvati relieves one of having gather accumulations and perfect the perfections, and so on, the normal duties of a bodhisattva on the path. In fact, as it is well known and as you admit above, some who are born in Sukhāvti do not hear the voice or see the face of Amitabha for five hundred years. This is crucial because the Tathāgatānāṃbuddhakṣetraguṇoktadharmaparyāya states that a single day in Sukhavāti equals a kalpa in the Sahā world. This means that those who are stuck in lotuses in Sukhavāti must remain there for the equivalent of 182,500 kalpas (500 * 365) in human time. Of course they don't suffer, but still they are trapped, cannot hear the dharma, see the Buddha and so on. This is an unimaginable amount of time. 

Further, this assertion of yours that the Large Sūtra is the last remaining sutra after the Buddha's doctrine is questionable, and lacks scriptural support, despite the Chinese translation of this text. 

What is known as the Large Sūtra in the Tibetan canon does not affirm this, It merely states, "In the future, until the sublime Dharma utterly perishes, this great Dharmapariyaya will be truly praised by all the buddhas, extolled by all the buddhas, and conferred by all the buddhas." But there is no mention at all of it being the last surviving sūtra at the end of Śākyamūni's dispensation, as the Sanskrit (See Gomez, Land of Bliss: Hawaii, 1996, pg. 108: section 150) also bears out.

This isn't possible. Only buddhas can perceive the dharmakāya. Not even tenth stage bodhisattvas can perceive the dharmakāya. And, Amitabha's buddhafield is most certainly a nirmāṇakāya buddhafield. This means that the Buddha's statement in the Lanka about buddhas attaining buddhahood only in Akaniṣṭha Ghanavyūha should be observed: 

"Perfect buddhahood is attained there,
the emanated ones attain buddhahood here."

Jñānaśrībhadra comments, "The exhibition of the nirmāṇakāya's buddhahood lacks the fortune and the conditions of exhibiting the sambhogakāya, but if the nirmāṇakāya's buddhahood is not exhibited, sentient beings of the desire realm will lack confidence."
 
Further, the great Tibetan Buddhist master, Tāranātha (as well as other masters) clearly identifies Sukhāvati as a nirmāṇakāya buddhafield in his reply to one Geshe Paldan Śākya, "The Kusmalatagarbha buddhafield mentioned in the ninetieth chapter of the Avatamska Sūtra is the nirmāṇakāya buddhafield of Buddha Vairocana, not Akaniṣṭha Ghanavyūha, because it is explained that the buddhafield of Buddha of Vairocana has definite dimensions and is newly made, like Sukhāvati." In other words, Sukhāvati is a conditioned buddhafield, unlike the sambhogakāya buddhafield of Akaniṣṭha Ghanavyūha. 

In the context of birth in Sukhāvati, no one there directly receives teachings from the dharmakāya, other than in the sense that they hear the words from the tongue of Buddha Amitabha. And of course, many beings there are not so blessed, since they reside inside of lotuses which block their sight of Amitabha Buddha for what are in human terms, eons. So while your enthusiasm for Amitabha and Sukhāvati are indeed laudable, it is misconception to claim, as you do, "you are learning from the Dharmakāya itself, it is instantaneous and beyond the need for methods that can be calculated in the normal sense of duration and ascension." Sukhavati is a pure buddhafield, but it is a nirmāṇakāya buddhafield only, it is not beyond time. 

You are correct in asserting however, that from the vantage point of Sukhāvati one may obtain teachings from other nirmāṇakāya buddhafields with more ease.

All supreme nirmāṇakāyas have life spans that are in line with the lifespan of humans in the age into which they are born, just as they are born into either brahmin, kṣatriya, or vaisya families depending on which are more respected at the time.

Nope, but it is an absurd position that the Buddha would certainly not support, since the Buddha spent a lot of time trying to convince people that karmic ripening could be pretty horrible, and that they ought to do their best to avoid being born in lower realms and so on. So I think that we can conclude that there is no pervasion in MOP's statement:

"Whatever happens, it is good"

To break this down:

All events are good;
The holocaust is an event:
Therefore, the holocaust is good.

You can try this at home:

All events are good;
The ______ is an event:
Therefore, the ____ is good.

For example:

All events are good;
The war is an event: 
Therefore, the war is good.

As opposed to say:

All events are good;
The birthday party is an event:
Therefore, the birthday is good.

The above shows that the pervasion or concomitance does not apply in the minor premise; this means the major premise, "all events are good" is flawed and refuted. I merely showed through a consequence that the premise was flawed. It is not my fault his proposition is untenable as written.
