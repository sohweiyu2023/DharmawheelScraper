Nāgārjuna's intent is not solely to reduce opponent arguments to absurdities. If this were all he was interested in, Nāgārjuna's Madhyamaka would have no value and would be mere sophistry.

Instead, Nāgārjuna's project is correct deviations from a proper understanding of dependent origination. This is made clear in the maṅgalaṃ of the MMK.

As for your first question, yes, all beings experience so-called mother luminosity at the time of death. But if they have not practiced a path, so-called child luminosity, they will not recognize the mother, and so the mother and the child do not meet. 

As for your second question, the experience of luminosity itself is insufficient to eliminate afflictions. One has to recognize and remain in that luminosity. 

Luminosity is already the nature of your mind, so it is quite clear that luminosity does not eradicate afflictions. Only insight has that power.

This is why I stated that really there really was no combined Zhitro sadhana in Yangzab, in general. It just isn't the same system as say the Karling Shitro, etc. 

I've received this empowerment from Ontul Rinpoche. I've also received the lung for all the basic texts in Yangzab, again from Ontul Rinpoche. 

There are other systems where this is the case as well, for example, in the Khandro Nyinthig, there is a five buddha family peaceful deitiy practice, but no wrathful deity practice, other than Yogini and Hayagriva. Yangzab is actually a branch of the Khandro Nyinthig. 

In reality, the Yangzab Shitro is more like the Guhyagarbha system, where there are separate sadhanas for the peaceful deities and the wrathful deities.

There is a manual on how to combine the mandalas in order to give the empowerment.

The Longsal Tantra sums it up rather nicely:

By maintaining the view of trekchö
one reaches the ultimate result, thögal. 

And:

There are two in the trekchö:
neither a hair of meditation
nor a second of distraction. 

There are two in thögal:
light practice 
and dark practice.

And:

Since the supreme critical point of buddhahood through understanding
is this unsurpassed trekchö, 
that is the meaning of distinguishing mind and vidyā. 

And:

For example, like a polished mirror
in which any kind of image is clear. 
if the meaning of trekchö is not clear, 
even though thögal arises, it will have subject and object.

And:

Without trekchö, there is no thögal. 
Without thögal, there is no trekchö.

And

Understanding that outer and inner phenomena have always been empty, 
trekchö and thögal are inseparable.

Again, it quite depends on what one wants use one has for a database. For example, I can't think of a single company that would trust any of their secure data in a shared node database of the kind that bitcoin employs. At this juncture, it seems that the best use for blockchain databases is logistics tracking in a supply chain. But blockchain databases begin to degenerate in performance when the datasets become large and complex. 

A relational database is as secure as the network it is set up on and the servers in which it sits. It is generally much superior to a blockchain database in terms data integrity (aka normalization), speed, and so on, when working with multiple data points in a complex environment. Its performance can suffer if encryption is required on tables in the database itself. But encryption load can also be downside of blockchain databases. 

So again, it just depends on the application. Remember, everything looks like a nail to a hammer.

In the Commentary to the Tantra Without Syllables, pp. 166, it is stated:

Since the reality of inexpressible Atiyoga cannot be illustrated by the path of the partisan tenets of the nine vehicles, it naturally cannot be illustrated by their different terminologies. Therefore, since there is no grasping to the different objects of the five sense gates in the mode of being of entities, it cannot be confirmed with words. Therefore, it is explained that yogis who adhere to words are deviating into the common vehicles.

The actual rule of the Ganden Phodrang started in 1642 with the execution of Karma Tenkyong, the king of Tsang, and ended in 1704 with the abduction and probable execution of the 6th Dalai Lama in 1706. It was born in the bloodshed of the war of king of Tsang. The 7th Dalai Lama was politically weak, as were the 8th-12th. 

The political situation of Tibet was precarious at best, and actually saw very few periods of overall peace and prosperity. We can see this actually in the flourishing of the first renaissance in Tibet, from 1000 to roughly 1250. Then again, from roughly 1400-1500. Otherwise, Tibetan history was filled with a lot of war, violence, and power struggles.

There are a variety of opinions out there.

He maintained that only direct introduction and so-called "meaning empowerments" could be given online. There are a number of other teachers who happen to agree with ChNN's stance on this point. 

In the end, one has to follow one's own feelings. No one should be surprised if they attended an online empowerment, live or recorded from one teacher, only to be told by another teacher the latter do not consider that a valid means of empowerment.

What Rongzom is making a distinction between is the pristine consciousness of the basis, which he equates with self-originated pristine consciousness and nonconceptual pristine consciousness, which is relative and arises from concepts. 

So what does he say "self-originated" pristine consciousness is? He states that is the luminous nature of the mind. This is the only kind of "pristine consciousness" a buddha can be said to posses. But we also posses this, right now. 

He details three basic kinds of gnosis or pristine consciousness: non-conceptual, pure-mundane, and self-originated. The first two are two types of gnosis with which we are generally familiar. The third is the so-called "self-originated gnosis." 

Rongzom is arguing merely that all phenomena are self-originated gnosis:

"Observe that all experiential ranges self arise as self-originated pristine consciousness." Experiential range refers to the experiential range of the sense organs of the six migrating beings. Self-originated pristine consciousness refers to the fact that since all formations are peaceful by nature, pristine consciousness self-originated.

An extrinsic gnosis is one obtained from outside, like a guru or a book. Self-orginated gnosis is a gnosis one discovers for oneself.

Nice try. It’s not that matter is mind stuff, but with the action of sentient beings in the world, matter, the four elements won’t arise. The reason the universe forms (repeatedly) is due to the afflictions and karma of sentient beings.

I honestly don't know what is says in Gongcik, I have never studied it. 

I know however that Gampopa's view of gnosis is more or less the same as Rongzom's. You can discover this by reading chapter 20 of Gampopa's Jewel Ornament of Liberation, where he dismisses the idea that the twin gnosis of a buddha are anything but illusory and do not exist ultimately. He summarizes his position as follows:

"That being the case, the Buddha is the dharmakāya. Since the dharmakāya is nonarising and free from proliferation, it does not possess gnosis. Now then, if it is said that this contradicts the teachings in sūtra that that there are two gnoses, there is no contradiction. Just as when an eye consciousness arises appearing as blue, it is said "blue is seen," likewise, that gnosis that becomes the dharmadhātu is maintained to be the gnosis of how things are. Since the gnosis that knows as much as there is to know is relative, it is defined as an appearance for those to be tamed."

So, in this way, we can see that there is little difference between Rongzom and Gampopa's perspectives.

The two samadhis are the same: what is different is the person who is in those samadhis. In the case of hindus, that samadhi is not liberative, think of it as super-śamatha. In the case of a buddhist, it is the samadhi that arises beyond the āyatana of neither perception nor nonperception, the highest state of samsara, and is the samadhi that destroys all remaining traces of latent affliction, hence it is called "vajra-like."

Since the mainline of Madhyamaka schools accept the Śravakayāna model of cognition, a sense consciousness only arises when the sense organ meets a sense object, this itself is a confirmation of the idea that Madhyamaka conventionally accepts object which exist independent of the mind. 

Similarly, in the Dzogchen tradition, it is held that outer objects exist conventionally.

However, the term "realist" is problematical. Madhyamaka is not a realist school, unlike the lower three tenet systems.

Being free of vikalpa is not liberation, this is why Hindu nirvikalpa samadhi is not liberation, but when someone has insight into emptiness, then there is no difference between nirvikalpa samadhi and vajropama samadhi, they are in fact the same thing.

One can certainly decide one no longer wishes to follow them, but there is no way to formally return them without incurring a downfall, unlike monastic vows, in which you can return them to the person who ordained you, or failing that, a senior member of the ordained sangha.

Hi Magnus:

I addressed this discrepancy above. Some people consider arising without a seed syllable "Dzogchen development," but it is really just instant anuyoga creation stage. In Dzogchen proper, there is no creation and completion stage. In Dzogchen proper, there is no deity to create at all. Not understanding this point, many people mistake terms like "Dzogchen generation" for the actual practice of Dzogchen. You can ascertain this by looking up creation/generation stage in the index of the Tantra Without Syllables. But in particular, the deviations of the nine yānas are explained on pg. 180-181.

“Oh Vajrapāṇi, listen!
The vehicle of the great āgamas of Anuyoga
maintains that two aspects, the dhātu and pristine
consciousness,
are held to be the vajra of inseparability.
The entryway is either instant or gradual.
The view to be realized is inseparability.

If it is asked what is instant entry,
deities are not created, but perfected by merely recalling
the essence.
If it is asked what is gradual entry,
having gradually entered the dhātu and pristine
consciousness,
one obtains the result on the stage of Vajradhara.

Self Arisen Vidyā Tantra, pg. 188. 

There are two approaches in Anuyoga. In the instant approach, there is no practice of the three samadhis and no summoning of a jñānasattva. 

In the gradual approach, the three samadhis are summarized by the recollection of Samanbhadra, Samantabhadri, that is, pristine consciousness and the dhātu respectively, whose union results in the child, the seed syllable. In gradual Anuyoga sadhanas, there may be nominal jñānasattva, but the view is emphasized that there is no actual separation between the samayasattva and jñānasattva and nothing actually is invoked.

There is only one explanation of the three inner tantras: a Nyingma one. There is no such thing as a "Kagyu approach to the three inner tantras."

There is only one thing conducive to liberation: seeing through the obscuration of self-grasping through realizing emptiness, which burns up afflictions. 

Creation stage is something predicated on an Abhidharma model of a putative person, unlike Ronald McDonald. A deity is not an integral person anymore than we are. This is demonstrated by the Guru's three seats, for example, from whom we take empowerment, the five buddhas, their consorts, the male and female bodhisattvas, and the ten wrathful ones. We do not actually receive empowerment from a guru as an integral person, because an integral person is just a fiction. To break down that fiction, we substitute another fiction: the mandala. To break down the fiction of the mandala, we use the completion stage.

If Ronald Mcdonald is taught by a Buddha in a tantra as a means of purifying the aggregate of sensation, then sure. If not, then I am afraid you are shit out of luck. 

The reason we have a completion stage is to eliminate the conceptuality of the creation stage. The creation stage is meant to substitute impure conceptuality with pure conceptuality. The completion stage is meant to eradicate even pure conceptuality. Imagining oneself as a deity is just an exercise in conceptuality that also must be overcome.

Further, there are many sūtras, where based on the pranidhanas or aspirations of a given bodhisattva, their resultant buddhafield will admit the aspirant. For example, the Medicine Buddha pureland can be accessed by minimally reciting the Bhaisajyaguru dhāraṇi seven times a day, etc.

There are no similarities between what the mystics of other traditions believe and what the Buddha taught and what has been practiced and realized in Buddhadharma since time immemorial. It is for this reason, for example, that the Rig pa Rang Shar divides vehicles into vehicles of samsara and vehicles of nirvana. Outside the nine yānas, everything else is a samsaric vehicle.

Again, since you are hard of hearing: being an atheist is one thing; being a followe of atheism is another. 

For example, I don't believe in emptiness, but things are empty. 

I don't _believe_ there is no God since the doctrine of dependent origination excludes the possibility of such a being. I don't believe in dependent origination, it is obvious that all compounded entities arise dependently. As such, that makes me an atheist, but it does not make me a believer in Atheism, mainstream or otherwise.

The only sentient beings who can attain liberation are human beings. This is why a human birth is called "precious." Hell beings, pretas, animals, asuras, and devas cannot attain buddhahood. 

For this reason, whether hell beings, pretas, asuras, and devas exist or not is irrelevant to the path.

Monastics, in Tibetan Buddhism, only recite prātimokṣa on Posada days. 

However, there are many daily prayers they might do, depending on the monastery. Typically a Sakya monastery day begins with puja to Tārā, which will included a daily recital that reaffirms both prātimokṣa and bodhisattva vows. The Triskandha Sūtra is a common recitation, for example. And since most monastics are Vajrayāna practitioners, their sādhana recitations will take care of maintaining their vows. But it really depends on school to school and monastery to monastery.

Not surprisingly, both scientific skeptics and theists whose ideas of God center primarily on the notion of "intelligent design" have found Darwinian ideas religiously incoherent.

Definition of atheist
: a person who does not believe in the existence of a god or any gods : one who subscribes to or advocates atheism

While some argue against defining Buddhadharma as atheist, Muslims, Christians, theists in general understand Buddhadharma as an atheist tradition. For Buddhadharma, devas are just sentient beings who, when they exhaust their merit, fall into lower realms, nothing special at all. We believe in devas with about the same fervor as we believe in leprechauns, kobolds, elves, and fairies.

As an atheist, I do not believe that any version of theism—whether poly, pan, or mono—leads to liberation. I go for refuge to the Three Jewels. Whether there are mundane gods or not (not to mention the existence of a supreme being) is quite irrelevant. 

Buddhism in atheist because we eschew refuge in all versions of theism, no matter what adjective one places before it.

So basically, you are claiming that to be an atheist is necessarily to be a physicalist along the model of Dennet, etc. 

Samantabhadra is not some external buddha in a concrete sense, other than as a symbolic name for the realization of dharmakāya. Sambhogakāya likewise is just a name for realized speech, but it does not exist somewhere "out there." Buddhafields are just other planets and dimensions that have been "prepared" in some fashion by a bodhisattva on the stages. 

But none of these were created by an omnipotent supreme being; moreover, our liberation does not depend on our relationship with some "savior," unlike theistic religions.

Inference and direct perceptions can be confirmed by second parties. This is the basis for empiricism. 

For example, I see smoke, and infer there is a fire. I tell another there is smoke, and thus, there must be a fire. They investigate, confirm there is a fire and let me know that indeed my inference was correct. Hence, there was a fire which produced smoke, and it occurred independently of my specific experience of it.

He is actually criticizing theism in this passage. Theists maintain there is a first cause, an unmoved mover, a creator who exists apart from its creation. Here,  THT is actually engaging in what most Christians since the 3rd century CE would classically consider a heresy. 

He is making that point that there must be some link between a cause and its effect, so in this respect, he is rejecting the the idea of the uncompounded creator. There are many arguments in Buddhadharma against such an uncompounded creator, which I am sure he knows well. So in this passage he is trying to lead this person into a Buddhist view. If you accept that a creator is not separate from its creation; it follows the creator, like the creation, must arise from a cause. If a creator arises from a cause, then what kind of a creator is this? Such a creator is just a noncreator, since it too is created from a cause, and is in fact an effect. 

He is also saying that people tend to see ultimate principles in their own image: flowers see flowers as ultimate, etc. But it is not a defense of theism in Buddhadharma at all.

A common doctrine of theistic religions is ex nihilo creation by a supreme being. There is no sūtra which teaches such creation of the universe or living beings.

They are for Gorampa as well, providing tathāgatagarbha is properly understood. But if for example the nine examples are not correctly understood, he states the TTG sūtras are provisional. 

Also, the reason Longchenpa claims the TTG sūtras are definitive has to do with how he understands them in relation to Dzogchen. He also defines Prasanga Madhyamaka as the definitive view. 

In general, however, the Buddha himself declares the tathāgatagarbha doctrine provisional, that is interpretable, in the Lanka Sūtra.

Clearly, Dogen perceives stages in zazen, for exmple, on page 859 of Tanahashi translation.

The Shamathayana referring to the Buddha’s attaining awakening in one session is the one I was referring to. 

For ordinary people, vipashyana first, then shamatha.

In any case, no matter what one’s rhetorical stance, all Buddhist equipoise practice ultimately comes down to a union of shamatha and vipashyana.

Otherwise, are we expected to believe the magical theory that merely  sitting in a Soto Zendo somehow is sitting in the state of Buddhahood? Or that merely sitting in a posture is Buddhahood? Clearly you can see the ridiculous consequences emerging from such a stance. Obviously Dogen didn’t believe this.

I think the author is trying to point out that there is a bit of a Pizza effect happening here. D.T. Suzuki imported William James' notion of religious experience from his book Varieties of Religious Experience to Japan; this interested the Kyoto school, Sanbokyodan, etc., this in turn caused the latter tradition to export a version of Zen to the West which is profoundly informed by Western ideas about religious experience. Varieties of Religious Experience was catalyzed by William James' experiments with Nitrous Oxide.

Clyde, I think the disconnect you are seeing is that in Japan, Soto is a religious institution, a major function of which is to do funerary rites, etc. They serve a client population with rituals. I am sure this is also true with Rinzai, etc. 

These services are not generally requested by Westerners, some of whom seem to think they are going to become enlightened or think they already are, regarding "practice" as a performative demonstration of their innate enlightenment.

And some academics, while not personally interested in practice, like Robert Mayer, nevertheless do excellent work.

The Indian mind was a lot more flexible about such issues. This is why one sees tropes shared with the Ramayāna that show up recontextualized in a Buddhist context, for example, to explain the origins of the Buddhist protectress, Śṛīdevi Mahākālī.  Śṛīdevi is known originally named Sita Śankhapāla. She elopes with Dasagriva aka Ravanna, having been tricked into it by Dasagriva's sister, Remati. Umadevi (the worldly manifestation of the protectress Ekajati), her mother disowns her, and Sita Śankhapāla takes on the form of a rakṣasī as a result, etc., eventually to be tamed by the Brahmin Vararuci. Since as far as I am concerned this is a myth and the myth of Sita's abduction by Ravanna have equal standing as a myth, I don't worry about it too much. In Tibet, different schools have different accounts of the taming of Rudra, all based on Indian sources, they are often in conflict about details, and no one blinks an eyelash. Indeed, in the same school different tantric cycles will have differing explanations of the taming of Rudra, and again, no one bats an eyelash. The validity of the practice has more to do with whether one can manifest siddhis from it, rather than whether or not it fits some neurotic compulsion to reconcile different narratives. For example, in Shingon, it is maintained that the tantras were first revealed by Vajrasattva in an iron towed in South India. In Tibet, in the Sarma schools, it is generally maintained that the tantras were also revealed in South India by a king who travelled to Oddiyāna and received them a siddha yoginī who was descendent from Nāgas. In Nyingma, it is generally held they were first revealed by a king in Zahor named Dza. While there is a bit of bickering back and forth between the Nyingmas and the Sarma schools over the accuracy of the interpretation of the King Dza account, not one really cares that much. Then, of course, the Bonpos claim they are the source of everything, but no one pays them much mind either. When Buddhists resort to the services of Bonpo Lamas it is because the latter have siddhi, not because Buddhists accept Bonpo history. But talk of siddhis will get you shut down pretty fast in the Academy.

Content:
In the Indian Buddhist tantras preserved in the Kengyur, there are 93 mentions of vajrayāna; 2 mentions of guhyamantrayāna; and 21 mentions of mantrayāna. 

In the Indian commentarial literature preserved in the Tengyur, there are 461 mentions of vajrayāna; 75 for guhyamantrayāna; and 191 for mantrayāna, but many times, mantrayāna and guhyamantrayāna are quite close to each other in proximity, meaning that the former is often a contraction of the latter. 

I would say, that since the Vajramāla commentary and other texts equate Vajrayāna and Mantrayāna, Vajrayāna is clearly the more widespread and widely used term in Indian sources, and therefore, mere force of usage in Indian literature favors the use of the term Vajrayāna as an overall name for this Buddhist textual movement.

In Tibetan sources one often see "Secret Mantra Vajrayāna" (gsang sngags rdo rje'i theg pa).

To add to this, the earlier tantras transmitted to Japan are quite few in number, compared with the very large amount of tantras transmitted to Tibet at exactly the same time (800 CE). The term "vajrayāna" was already widely used in India by this time even for so-called "lower tantras" like the Subāhuparipṛcchā Tantra, or "yoga tantras" like the Vajraśikhara tantra, in which is found the term "vajrayāna," though not in the incomplete version translated by Amoghasiddhi.

If I understand what she has been saying here for more than a decade, she is criticizing what she sees as historical revisionism in Japan, which in her view has had a deleterious effect on how the Soto tradition is understood in the West by both academics and practitioners, resulting an anti-intellectual, enervated interpretation of Shikantaza that is more of a faith-based practice than authentic zen, and does not represent the actual practice of the Soto school over the centuries.

The consequence of this is that one is only realized during shikantaza. How does this escape the equipoise/post-equipoise division? And if there is a division between equipoise/post-equipoise, this means that there are stages.

Mahāyāna, as a self-conscious movement, begins with Nāgārjuna. Why do I say this? Nāgārjuna was the first identifiable author that we know of in the history of Buddhism to defend the sūtra tradition we call Mahāyāna. This is why he is the most important Mahāyāna figure, apart from the Buddha in Mahāyāna sūtras. Of course there were Mahāyāna sūtras prior to Nāgārjuna, but he was the first person to articulate a polemical defense of Mahāyāna and the first historical person (by western criteria) to give Mahāyāna a serious intellectual platform.

The middle way is inexpressible. It's beyond convention. That's the point. 

If you are claiming that the term "the middle way" is merely a convention, thats fine. The words "middle way" have a function. But those words are not the inexpressible middle way taught by the Buddha in the sutras I mentioned.  

If something has a function, it is compounded, and impermanent. There are no permanent, functional phenomena. Buddhanature is not a functional phenomena, if it were, it would be compounded.

In the Kagyu tradition, there are also many commentaries, but I am not sure which Indian commentaries they regard as authoritative. JKLT wrote a commentary on Hevajra that is supposed to be quite good, but I have not read it.

Not only that, but the things I mentioned are quite acceptable conventionally. Why? Because they are functional, arthakriya. For example, if one does not accept space, there can be no extension and all material entities must occupy the same location, etc.

But as Nagārajuna cogently points out in the MMK, 

Since arising, abiding, and perishing are not established, the compounded are not established;
since the compounded have never been established, why would the uncompounded be established?

Ārya-dharmasaṃgīti-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:


Child of a good family, so called "suchness, suchness" is a term designating emptiness. The empty neither arise nor cease. 


As for QQ:

Ārya-aṣṭādaśasāhasrikā-prajñāpāramitā-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

If one is diligent in the emptiness of ignorance, one is called diligent. If one is diligent in the emptiness of ignorance, formations, consciousness, name, form, six sense bases, contact, sensation, craving, addiction, becoming, birth, aging, and death, one is called "diligent." If one is diligent in the emptiness of all dharmas, one is called "diligent." If one is diligent in the emptiness of compounded and uncompounded phenomena, one is called "diligent." 

The Sūtra of Great Liberation (no Sanskrit title, so probably translated from Chinese):

That being the case, child of a good family, the Buddha is the the dharma, the dharma is the sangha. The sangha is uncompounded. The uncompounded is emptiness. The emptiness of the uncompounded, the emptiness of the compounded, the internal emptiness, and external emptiness, the emptiness of the large, and the emptiness of the small are alike as emptiness, and not otherwise. 

As for the middle way, the so-called middle way is inexpressible as we see in such sūtras as the Ārya-kāśyapa-parivarta-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

Kāśyapa, if it is asked how one undertakes the dharma according to the approach of a bodhisattva, it is as follows, true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way. 

Kāśyapa, If it is asked what is true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way, Kāśyapa, the true discernment into the absence of identity, true discernment into the absence of a sentient being, the absence of a creature, the absence of a life, the absence of a person, the absence of an individual, the absence of a human, the absence of a man. Kāśyapa, this is called "true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way."

Kāśyapa, furthermore, the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way is not discerning permanence nor discerning impermanence in matter. Kāśyapa, likewise, it is not discerning permanence nor discerning impermanence in sensations, perceptions, formations, and consciousness. Kāśyapa, this is called "orrect discernment into the dharmas of the middle way."

 Kāśyapa, further, the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way is is not discerning permanence nor discerning impermanence in the element of earth, and likewise, is not discerning permanence nor discerning impermanence in the element of water, the element of fire, the element of air, the element of space, or the element of consciousness. Kāśyapa, this is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way."

Kāśyapa, further, the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way is not discerning permanence nor discerning impermanence in the eye sense base, and likewise, not discerning permanence nor discerning impermanence in the ear, nose, tongue, tactile, and mental sense bases.  Kāśyapa, this is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way."

Kāśyapa, "permanence" is one extreme, "impermanence" is the second extreme. Whatever is between those two extremes cannot be investigated, demonstrated, cannot be a support, cannot appear, cannot be made known, and cannot abide. Kāśyapa, this is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way." 

Kāśyapa, "self" is one extreme, "nonself" is the second extreme. Whatever is between those two extremes cannot be investigated, demonstrated, cannot be a support, cannot appear, cannot be made known, and cannot abide. Kāśyapa, this is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way." 

Kāśyapa, "correct thought" is one extreme, "incorrect thought" is the second extreme. Absence of thought, absence of intention, absence of mind, and absence of consciousness, Kāśyapa, this is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way." 

All dharmas of virtue and nonvirtue, mundane and transcendent, with sin and without sin, contaminated and uncontaminated, compounded and uncompounded are just like that. 

Kāśyapa, "afflicted" is one extreme, "purified" is the second extreme. Whatever is  nonacceptance, nonexpression, or nonspeaking of those two extremes,  Kāśyapa, this is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way." 

Kāśyapa, "existence" is one extreme, "nonexistence" is the second extreme. Whatever is between those two extremes cannot be investigated, demonstrated, cannot be a support, cannot appear, cannot be made known, and cannot abide. Kāśyapa, this is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way." 

Kāśyapa, "samsara" is one extreme, "nirvana" is the second extreme. Whatever is between those two extremes cannot be investigated, demonstrated, cannot be a support, cannot appear, cannot be made known, and cannot abide. Kāśyapa, this is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way." 

Kāśyapa, I have explained to you, "Through the condition of ignorance arise formations; through the condition of formations, consciousness; through the condition of consciousness, name-and-form; through the condition of name-and-form, six sense bases; through the condition of six-sense bases, contact; through the condition of contact, sensation; through the condition of sensation, craving; through the condition of craving, addiction; through the condition of addiction, becoming; through the condition of becoming, birth, through the condition of birth, aging-and-death, misery, lamentation, suffering, unhappiness, and the arising of disturbance. As such only a great mass of suffering arises. 

Because ignorance ceases, formations cease; because formations cease, consciousness ceases; because consciousness ceases, name-and-form ceases; because name-and-form ceases, the six sense bases cease; because the six sense bases cease, contact ceases; because contact ceases, sensation ceases; because sensation ceases, craving ceases; because craving ceases, addiction ceases; because addiction ceases, becoming ceases; because becoming ceases, birth ceases; because birth ceases, aging-and-death, misery, lamentation, unhappiness, and disturbance cease. As such, this whole mass of suffering ceases." 

Kāśyapa, knowledge and ignorance, those are not two, but are inseparable as two aspects.  Kāśyapa, knowledge of this is called the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way. 

Likewise, formations and the cessation of formations; consciousness and the cessation of consciousness; name-and-form and the cessation of name-and-form; six sense bases and the cessation of six sense bases; sensation and the cessation of sensation; craving and the cessation of craving; addiction and and the cessation of addiction; becoming and the cessation of becoming; birth and the cessation of birth; aging-and-death and the cessation of aging-and-death, those are not two, but are inseparable as two aspects. Knowledge of this is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way." 

Kāśyapa, moreover, the true discernment into dharmas of the middle way is not making dharmas empty with emptiness, dharmas themselves are empty; it is not making dharmas without characteristics with the absence of characteristics; dharmas themselves lack characteristics; it is not making dharmas free of aspiration through aspirationlessness, dharmas themselves are without aspiration; it is not making dharmas unfabricated through nonfabrication, dharmas themselves are not fabricated; it is not making dharma not arise through nonarising, dharmas themselves do not arise; it is not making dharmas unproduced through nonproduction, dharmas themselves are unproduced; it is not making dharmas lack inherent existence through lacking inherent existence, dharmas themselves lack inherent existence. And such discernment, Kāśyapa, is called "the true discernment into the dharmas of the middle way."


And the Mahāparinirvana sūtra:

Bodhisattvas teach the middle way. If it is asked why, though all dharmas do not exist, it is also explained they do not not exist, and are not ascertained to be the same. Why? Consciousness arises by means of the condition of eye, form, light, mental factors, and the intellect. Also it is definite that consciousness does not exist in the eye, the form, the light, the mental factor, nor the the intellect, nor in between. It does not exist, it does not not exist, but because it arises from being dependently produced it is said "to exist." Because it has no inherent existence, it is said "not to exist." Therefore, the Tathāgata has said that though all dharmas do not exist neither do they not exist.

and the Ārya-mahāyānopadeśa-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

Abandoning all views is entering into the middle way, seeing all dharmas as equal. 

But one does not need to propose a third truth to understand this.

Arya-pratyutpanne buddha-saṃmukhāvasthita-samādhi-nāma-mahāyāna-sūtra:

Bhadrapāla, in that way, any son or daughter of a good family who wishes for perfect full awakening and any son or daughter of a good family who wishes for personal awakening, or any son or daughter of a good family who wishes for arhatship, they must investigate those dharmas. After they investigate those dharmas in that way, dharmas should not be investigated as pacified, nor should they be investigated as not pacified. Why Bhadrapāla? Because nothing is destroyed and nothing is born. If one conceives "all dharmas are pacified" in dharmas that are totally unestablished, this is one extreme. If one conceives "all dharmas are not pacified", this is the second extreme. 

Bhadrapāla, not perceiving, not conceiving, not establishing, not thinking about, and not engaging these two extremes—pacified and unpacified—is the middle way through the explanation of the mundane relative in a manner of enumeration, however, in the ultimate, the extremes or the middle are not perceived. Why Bhadrapāla? As such all phenomena are like space, equal with nirvana. They cannot be annihilated, cannot be destroyed, are not permanent, and do not exist forever. They do not abide in a region, they do not abide in a direction, they are without characteristics, and cannot be enumerated. Since they cannot even be approached by the learned through enumeration nor perceived, all phenomena are called "non-enumerable."

Correct. The first teaching I attended by CHNN, in 1992, he very carefully went into what it meant to “hold a lineage.” The idea of “lineage holders” is politics, more about intellectual property than anything else. The ability to transmit teachings depends on whether one has realized the meaning of a teaching. That’s it. Therefor, students have to be very discerning about whom they choose to,follow. The criteria for being able to give teachings is very clearly laid out in the tantras. That should be our guide, not lineage politics.
