The opening mangalaṃ of the MMK captures the entire meaning of the text:

I prostrate to the most sublime of teachers, 
the Perfect Buddha,
by whom dependent origination —
not ceasing nor arising,
not annihilated nor permanent, 
not going nor coming,
not different nor the same,
the pacification of proliferation — was demonstrated as peace.

If this is understood, the whole of the MMK will be understood with ease.

Correct. Why? Every time you take any empowerment into any deity, you are promising to take that deity as your yidam until you achieve awakening. So, when you have taken Dzogchen teachings, you should understand how to unify everything into one practice, and doing so fulfills all commitments. However, if you do not have this understanding, then it is better to be more judicious.

Of course, such instructions by HHDL, etc., are meant to discourage the merely curious.

Quite honestly, this is not what all the great masters of the past have taught. This practice 1) comes from lower tantras. 2) it arises from lineage provincialism.

For example, while it is the case that Vajrabhairava and Yamantaka are separate lineages, etc., there is not point in practicing both. There is no point in practicing the Sakya and the Gelug transmissions of Naro Khachö&nbsp;separately. There is no point in practicing two different forms of Hevajra, Vakrakilaya, or Kalacakra. 

The way to unify all commitments is in Guru Yoga. If you understand this, you understand the real point of the teachings. 

It is said that when Atisha came to Tibet, he thought he had nothing really to share, until he noticed one day that Rinchen Zangpo was practicing different several mandalas a day. Then Atisha realized he had a purpose and advised Rinchen Zangpo (many years his senior) to focus on one mandala, commenting, "Tibetans practice one hundred mandalas and realize none, whereas Indians practice one mandala and realize all."

But you have to understand the Nāgārjuna clearly shows that such an account of phenomena arising through causes and conditions is incoherent. 

There is a reason that the most important moment on the path of a bodhisattva is the understanding gained on the eighth bhumi, patience for the nonarising of phenomena. 

The ultimate conclusion of Madhyamaka is that nothing arises, yet everything appears. E ma ho!

In my opinion, irrespective of this or that empowerment, special or not, as long as one remains interested in the path, than all of your samayas are intact, whether or not you do this or that visualization or chant this or that mantra. 

Your vows are all rolled up in one question: are you interested in liberating yourself for the benefit of all sentient beings or not? If yes, then you have samaya. If not, then not. 

There are acts which can break your path commitments, but these also can be restored. Vajrayāna samaya is not whips and chains.

There is no such lexicon in Sanskrit either. 

There are no degrees of reality or existence. There is no state where something is partially real and partially unreal; partially true and partially false. 

In order for one to be a nihilist, one has to assert something that becomes nothing. As stated, Madhyamaka does not claim things do not exist; it merely removes the claim that this and that thing exist.

It is developing that spirit of generosity that perfects generosity, not whether one actually has anything to give.

Title: Re: The posture
Content:
Well, you do have to bear in mind that Jundo's teacher thinks the goal of seated practice is to cause a spontaneous alignment of the vertebrae of the spinal column resulting in a balanced "body-mind" which, according to him, is the essence of Soto practice. Here is his own summary of his theory of Zazen:

When he was 29 years old he left the palace in search of the meaning of life, and after several years, when he was 35 or 36, after adopting a simple method of physical practice that balanced his body and mind, he discovered what he had been searching for; he found that the world exists just at this time and in this place, and that the whole universe is splendid just as it is. For many years he taught his disciples about the simple practice and what it meant as the essential truth that all human beings should know. Gautama Buddha was not a god, but a man. And he taught that we can all return to our original state, which is serene and peace- ful. His teachings are not spiritual, but essentially humanistic; with this simple practice we can all attain our perfection as hu- man beings.


And:

What do we experience in Zazen?

Zazen is the simplest form of action, and when we are practicing
Zazen we do not intentionally think about anything or concentrate
on our feelings and perceptions. We sit in a simple nondiscriminating
state where our body-and-mind are balanced and
undivided. However, in order to discuss the state in Zazen we
cannot avoid making divisions and categorizations. In spite of
these categorizations, the actual experience of Zazen remains a
wholistic one.

We can describe four aspects in the practice of Zazen. They
are: 1) Different from thinking; 2) Making the body right; 3) Oneness
of body-and-mind; and 4) Oneness with the Universe.

1. Different from Thinking
The state in Zazen is without intention and is different from thinking.
This statement sounds strange as we normally believe that
we are always thinking. We avoid intentionally following a train
of thought during Zazen by concentrating on maintaining the
posture. Of course spontaneous thoughts and images arise in
our consciousness during Zazen, but they are not important.
When we notice that we are thinking about something, we should
simply stop. If we correct our posture, the thought or perception
will disappear and our consciousness will slowly become clear
and we will feel peaceful. In this peaceful and balanced state,
we are in the state that is “different from thinking.”

However, if we intentionally try to attain the state that is different
from thinking, we can never do so. When our consciousness
is full of thoughts and feelings during Zazen, we should
leave our state as it is. Our worries will bubble to the surface
and evaporate into the universe! In this way, by concentrating
on the posture, we will return naturally to our original state
during our practice.

2. Making the Body Right—a Balanced Autonomic Nervous System

In Zazen we sit on a cushion on the floor with both legs crossed,
and with our lower spine, upper spine, and head held straight
vertically. Keeping the spine straight has a direct and immediate
effect on the autonomic nervous system that controls many of
our body’s functions. Its effects include control of heart rate and
force of contraction, constriction and dilatation of blood vessels,
contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle in various organs,
the ability to focus the eyes and the size of the pupils, and the
secretion of hormones from various glands directly into the blood
stream.

The autonomic nervous system is composed of two subsystems:
the sympathetic and the parasympathetic nervous systems.
When the sympathetic nervous system is stimulated, our
heart rate increases, arteries and veins constrict, the lungs relax,
and our pupils dilate; in short, we become tense and alert. When
the parasympathetic nervous system is stimulated, the opposite
happens; our heart rate decreases, arteries and veins dilate, the
lungs contract, and the pupils constrict. You can see that the two
systems prepare the body for an active or passive response—
sometimes known as the “fight or flight” syndrome. When the
effect of the two systems on the organs is in balance, we are neither
ready to fight, nor ready to run away; we are in a normal
state.

The parasympathetic nerves emerge from the spinal chord
at the base of the spine (the second, third and fourth sacral vertebrae)
and through the cranial vertebrae in the neck, whereas
the sympathetic nerves emerge from the spinal chord through
the middle vertebrae in the back (the T1 to L2 vertebrae). 
Keeping the spine normally upright, with the
head sitting squarely on the top of the
vertebral column minimizes the compression
of the nerves of these two systems
at the points where the nerves
emerge through the vertebrae,
and ensures an uninterrupted
supply of blood, allowing them
to function normally. When the
parasympathetic and sympathetic
systems are both working
normally, they function in
opposition to give us a state of
balance of body-and-mind; not
too tense, and not too relaxed,
not overly optimistic or pessimistic;
not too aggressive
and not too passive. It is this physical state of balance in the
autonomic nervous system that give rise to what we call a balanced
body-and-mind.

In addition to this, sitting in the upright posture, where the
force of gravity acts down through the spine onto the pelvis, is a
position in which our body’s reflexes can work efficiently to integrate
the functioning of the whole body.

3. Oneness of Body and Mind in the Present Moment
Usually we think there is something that is called “mind” and
something else called “body” and that the two are separate, although
they have a great effect on each other. In Buddhism we
believe that body and mind are two sides of one entity, which
we call “myself,” but that we actually cannot fully grasp. We
believe that every mental phenomenon has a physical side, and
every physical phenomenon has a mental side. We do not believe
in the independent existence of something called “mind”
that is separate from the physical body, brain, nervous system,
and so on. When we sit in Zazen, because we do not concentrate
on thoughts, or perceptions, our body-and-mind exist undivided
in the present moment. When our mind is in the ordinary state
and our autonomic nervous system is balanced, we are in the
“balanced state of body-and-mind.”

4. Oneness with the Universe
When we are practicing Zazen, not only can we say that bodyand-
mind are one; we are also sitting in the state where there is
no distinction between ourselves and the external circumstances—
the world around us. Most people have at some time
experienced this simple feeling of oneness with everything, and
in Zazen we can notice that it is not just a feeling, but the actual
state of things in the present moment. When we are sitting in
Zazen we are one with the Universe, and the state includes all
things and phenomena. In that sense, although we are experiencing
the state, we cannot grasp it intellectually. We cannot
describe it completely. We call the state “ineffable,” or “dharma,”
or “truth,” or “reality.” But even these words are inadequate to
describe the simple and original state that we return to in Zazen.

Yes, it is quite unreasonable to have a subforum in a Buddhist forum in which it is allowed for people to attack the very foundations of Buddhadharma, and secondly, in a Mahāyāna forum, to attack the foundation of Mahāyāna. 

For example, Kim would like there to be some standard outside of Mahāyāna for Mahāyāna critiques of arhat path and so on. When evidence is provided from Mahāyāna Sūtras and treatises, it is dismissed as invalid. But this is quite ironic —&nbsp;here, in a Mahāyāna forum, evidence from Mahāyāna sūtras themselves are not counted as sufficient evidence for the Mahāyāna position. Amazing and disgusting.

Conventions are the imputed nature. Appearances are the imputed nature in the dependent nature. 

The mapping of the two truths to the three natures is a Tibetan thing. 

There is no mention at all of the the two truths in the three of the five treatises of Maitreya. The two truths are mentioned briefly in the Uttaratantra and once in the Sutra-alamkara. Any discussions about relative and ultimate truth are generally confined to Vasubandhu's Yogacara commentaries, etc., apart from Asanga breifly discussing them in his Uttaratantra commentary. 

Basically, it appears that Yogacarins tried to come up with an explanation of emptiness that completely bypasses the idea of the two truths.

It is pretty clear that conventions depend on appearances. In other words, there has to first be an appearance upon which a convention is settled. 

Relative truths are appearances to a misapprehending mind, while conventions are designations made on the basis of appearances. 

Thus, when it is said that something exists conventionally, this means no more and no less than a group of people have agreed that a given appearance bears the identity which has been agreed upon. Thus appearances do not depend on conventions, but conventions certainly depend on appearances. As such, they are a step removed from perception. Appearances are perceived, conventions are not, the latter are superimposed on appearances.

Yes, this is indeed Kongtrul's opinion, no one disputed that this was his opinion. What is under dispute is whether his opinion about Longchenpa is correct. I don't think that it is, and I think there is ample internal evidence in Longchenpa's writings that he was not a gzhan stong pa. As we have already seen, he identifies Candrakirtī has the one who holds the definitive view of Madhyamaka on page 798 of the grub mtha' mdzod. He declares on pg. 821, in the section devoted to explicating Candrakīrti's perspective:

 This principle is the pinnacle of all views of the vehicle of causal characteristics.

It is simply inconsistent to maintain that someone who clearly articulates that the pinnacle of cause vehicles views is Prasangika belongs to the gzhan stong persuasion. Longchenpa does state on page 900 that:

In response to including the needs of those of lower intelligence, this garbha is empty because it is empty of faults, conditioning and so on, but it is not an emptiness that discards the phenomena of its qualities, as already mentioned:

The characteristic of distinction is
is that the element is empty of the temporary [afflictions],
the characteristic of the absence of distinction
is not being empty of unsurpassed phenomena. 

The pure element that has the nature of the limit of reality is unconditioned like space. The happiness and suffering of samsara (supported on karma and affliction) appear like clouds. Moreover, the suffering because of improper afflicted mental activity is like a cloud. Since karma appears without any nature, it is like the aspect of a dream. The aggregates generated by karma and affliction are explained to be like illusions and clouds to remedy the grasping to one extreme of clinging to self. After that, since there arise five faults of clinging to the reifications of grasping to extremes in emptiness, in order to remove that, the tathagātagarba is explained...."

But frankly, the above statement by Longchenpa is simply not sufficient to place him in the gzhan stong camp, especially with reference to his declaration of the definitive Mahāyana view above, and in light of the fact that he clearly indicates the purpose of the tathagatagarbha view is to make the Mahāyāna path acceptable to those of lesser intelligence.

Or, practicing a sadhana in Ati style we have to consider Anu-ati because though we are resting in Dzogchen view at the end, still we are practicing some sadhana with an aim to get somewhere.

The view of Mahāyoga is that even though the mandala is primordially present, we need to practice reconstituting it, as it were, building it up and then plugging it in over and over again. In the view of Anuyoga, we don't have to keep plugging the mandala in, we plug it in once, and then just remember it when we want to. If we are practicing a sadhana Ati yoga style, we don't even bother visualizing anything, we recite the words, knowing that just thinking about the deity is sufficient, there is no need to meditate on it, and then we recite the mantra resting in our natural state, which is all the deity is anyway.

In the practice of Mahāyoga, there is still a summoning of the wisdom being, because there is still an idea that wisdom, even though it is innate, is something to attain.

What is novel is your idea that gzhan stong is merely concerned with explicating the teachings of the Uttaratantra, but this perspective is incredibly anachronistic and wrong headed as we can see from the historical progression of the master who gave gzhan stong its foundation [Dolbupa] and the various scholars who followed his lead.

This question is a non-sequitar. First of all, there is no ultimate "deity" — if it has hands, colors, eyes, legs, a torso, etc., it is something relative. If you are referring to the continuum of a bodhisattva like Mañjuśrī, it is not something which exists in one place that can be summoned to another place. 

Secondly,  Mañjuśrī's continuum cannot displace your own, no matter how hard you try to practice divine pride. But with practice, your continuum can become the same as Mañjuśrī's continuum, and depending on your chosen vehicle, with more or less effort. 

And, the higher up you go in the yānas, more and more emphasis is placed on personal experience and direct perception, and increasingly less is placed on testimony and inference. 

My personal opinion is that since Ati yoga places the most emphasis on personal experience and direct perception it is the best vehicle for westerners, among all the available Vajrayāna options. But that is just my orientation. Other people like imagining themselves as this and so on



And that is all well and good, very excellent paths, very excellent practices, all practiced with full attention and carefully can result in Buddhahood in a single lifetime, but Dzogchen is still faster and more direct...

Neither Mañjuśrī or Avalokiteśvara are concrete external entities at all in the context in which you mention them. 

"Divine pride" is a temporary method belonging to the creation stage, and as such it is a conceptual meditation, prophylactic in nature, meant to replace our ordinary sense of self. But this is not the end of the path, in order to attain buddhahood, we still must depend on the direct perception of the nature of our minds that both Mañjuśrī or Avalokiteśvara symbolize. But there is no external Mañjuśrī or Avalokiteśvara that merges with our minds. To believe there are means that one has utterly missed the point of the teachings completely. Even the summoning of the wisdom being into the commitment being is just a reminder that our real state has always been naturally perfected as a mandala, but there is no actual wisdom being that is summoned.

No, the fact is that Vajrayāna rites seem dead to people because they have no understanding of Abhidharma at even a minimal level, and thus do not understand the process of mandala creation as being a means of ritually transforming one's continuum and its aggregates, elements and sense gates into a mandala of awakened beings. The process is entirely symbolic and is not magical or supernatural in anyway at all. 

Ray's particular point of view is informed by something of an obsession with shamanism. But Tibetan Buddhism is not shamanism and is not principally concerned with communicating with non-human beings in general. But this seems to have become important to you somehow, an article of faith.

This is not at all true. The Buddha began all his teachings with something that everyone can see without having faith at all. Sarva dukkham, all is suffering. 

In Buddhadharma we do not go from lack of knowledge to knowledge, we go from verifiable knowledge to verifiable knowledge. 

The message of Dzogchen teachings is that one can have direct knowledge of one's primordial state, aka the basis, long before one can speak of realizing dharmakāya -- this direct knowledge is made into the path.

We don't need to fully realize the dharmakāya. We just need to have personal experience of the positive benefits of the Dharma, then we don't need "faith" because we have experience. 

In any case, you are asking the wrong question; it is not about the material world, per se. It would seem to be about the conditioned vs. the unconditioned. However, we don't take refuge in space or cessation, so it is not a question of conditioned vs. the unconditioned.

In Dzogchen, for example, one goes for refuge in one's own knowledge, i.e., rang rig la skyab su mchi'o or something to this effect is very common in Anuyoga level sadhanas. 

The real refuge is realization. When one begins to experience the positive effects of the Dharma in one's life, then one can have increased confidence in the Buddha's realization, and thus his Dharma. But the Buddha never wanted anyone to merely have blind faith and leave it at that. Buddha wanted people to see for themselves.

Depends on what level of refuge you mean, ultimate or relative? 

If the former, no, since only the dharmakāya, or realization of a buddha, is a true refuge. As your favorite book, the Uttaratantra makes clear, neither the Dharma nor the Sangha are true refuges since they are impermanent and conditioned. 

If the latter then there are all kinds of things that I can show you that are "true" refuges.

SMCJ seems to be arguing for some emotive kind of faith, a bhakti approach, tears streaming, etc. While such descriptions are certainly to be found in every description of Guru Yoga in traditional manuals, reading them over and over again in a hundred manuals, one comes to understand that these are literary themes meant to instill the point that we should feel deep gratitude to our gurus. It certainly does not mean that everytime we think of our teacher we should be overwhelmed with emotions. 

To illustrate my point further, most of the Tibetan teachers I have come into contact with deride the faith of simple Tibetans as being grounded in ignorance. They understand that kind of faith will never win with Western Buddhists who have a four hundred year history of the Enlightenment, and who, because of our vastly superior educational opportunities in the West, are never going to believe in Meru Cosmology merely because some teacher insists that we must. 

We do not live in a world with a Christian worldview anymore, despite smcj's insistence that all problems Western Buddhists face is our rejection of Christianity [or in my case, an utter lack of interest and connection with it], we live in a world dominated by a scientific worldview, with all of the faults and qualities inherent to it. 

Buddha's message is still "come and see for yourself." The further we get away from that message, the further away we get from the Dharma.

Title: Re: dharmapala vs yidam?
Content:
A dharmapāla is generally a bodhisattva in a wrathful, and usually non-human form, who has taken an oath to protect the Dharma. 

A yidam on the other hand is a method of practicing the path based on a sambhogakāya manifestation of a buddha. 

Some dharmapālas, such as Mahākāla also double as yidams, that is, they can be practiced as both depending on context and need. 

Wisdom dharmapālas are considered dharmapālas who are on the pure bodhisattva stages. Worldly dharmapālās are those who are not on the bodhisattva stages at all. The latter are generally powerful beings of the preta class who have been bound to the Dharma as losers in a conflict with a mahāsiddha such as Padmasambhāva. They frequently need to be reminded of their vows.

No, it is necessary to get past intellectualism and proceed with direct perception, that is the main point. There are two ways to approach that, the upāyamarga and mokṣamarga, i.e., the paths of method and liberation respectively. The former depends on  empowerment, and the two stages; the latter depends in direct introduction —&nbsp;but the main point is illustrated in the following way. In sūtra — and this applies to gzhan stong as much as anything else — the understanding of dharmatā is like a painting of a moon. The understanding of dharmatā in the path of method is like seeing a moon in the water. The understanding of dharmatā in the path of liberation is like looking at the moon directly from the start. 

Since gzhan stong is principally a sūtrayāna tenet, it requires a lot more faith. The teaching of sugatagarbha,for example, exists to remove five faults, it does not however mean that faith in sugatagarbha constitutes entering the path.

The first Tibetan to use the term was Kawa Paltseg, ninth century, and he used it refer to the Madhyamaka that was based on freedom from all extremes. More or less everyone had this usage until Dolbupa gummed up the works in the 14th century with his brand new "Uma chenpo."

Because of the popularity of Trungpa, when he introduced the gzhan stong/rang stong distinction in his seminaries, the term "Great Madhyamaka" became associated in western minds with gzhan stong. This was further reinforced by Hookham's book and by the Big Red Book, accompanied by a fairly aggressive campaign to promulgate gzhan stong as an alternative to Gelug Madhyamaka.

You are assuming that Longchenpa's views and Mipham's views are monolithic, cut from the same mold. They aren't. You can't just paste them up side by side without taking into account the vast differences in environment that produced them. 

Longchenpa is writing in a fairly polemic free environment, a full 100 years before the major controversies raised by Tsongkhapa and his opponents. He was mainly writing in an environment where Nyingma teachings in general were being somewhat neglected and provided a basis in scholarship for many of the teachings of Dzogchen. That being said, Longchenpa's writings also seem to have been neglected for quite a long while, perhaps because during this period Nyingma was institutionally weak. 

Mipham is writing at the end of 400 years of trenchant polemics between Gelugpas and everyone else. The vast majority of his critiques in the Original Mind Trilogy are being leveled at Gelugpas who presume to interpret Dzogchen through the lens of their own educational background. For example, the main recipient of criticism of MIpham is a guy named Jawa Dö ngag, who was a student of Zhabkar and Paltrul, who also had a Gelug background. 

The whole of the Original Mind series is a recording of Mipham's oral teachings in response to that fellow's interpretation of Dzogchen. Indeed, we can see a great deal of similarity between the ideas about Dzogchen that are being rejected by Mipham and some ideas about Dzogchen advanced today by HH Dalai Lama.

The point of view of both Dzogchen and Lamdre is that qualities are present in the basis in the form of a potential, but are not present as fully expressed. The latter is the gzhan stong perspective, which you can read about in Mountain Doctrine and other places. 

The difference is pretty well established in this way: in Dzogchen, the qualities are expressed by realizing the nature of the basis. Those qualities do not exist prior to realization. 

In gzhan stong, the qualities already exist, and are revealed merely through the removal of afflictions. 

In Dzogchen, afflictions become the five wisdoms through the process of realization; in gzhan stong the afflictions are absolutely different than the five wisdoms, the removal of the former reveals the latter. 

Moreover, the gzhan stong pas, the basis and result are undifferentiable. Mountain Doctrine, ppg. 89 states, "These say that this which is the body of attributes, matrix-of-one-done-to-bliss, element of attributes, omnipresent in all three states, is the very perfection of wisdom, the undifferentiable entity of the basis and fruit, the buddha lineage, and say that it exists at all times and the basis of all phenomena..."

No, the first turning concerns the four noble truths, etc., as the Samdhinirmocana Sūtra very clearly states:

At first, since the Bhagavan demonstrated the aspects of the four noble truths to those correctly participating in the vehicle in the deer park called Ṛṣivadanam, the amazing Dharma wheel he turned first was amazing, a corresponding Dharma had not been turned in the past by any deva nor any human. However, that Dharma wheel that the Bhagavan turned was surpassable, contextual, of provisional meaning, and a basis for contention.

gzhan stong pas claim that the qualities of the result are fully manifested in sentient beings, from the beginning. 

This is how Mipham characterizes it:

From the perspective of the mode of appearance, the basis itself never ripens as the result, and since that non-ripening is not the actual dharmakāya, since this present basis is not the buddhahood that manifest the ten powers from the mere cause of the dharmakāya, it may be considered that “dharmakāya of the basis” is not "the actual one.” Nevertheless, from the perspective of the just the time of the original basis, since the conventions of liberation and nornliberation do not exist, while there are no sentient beings, there are also no buddhas because liberation and delusion are totally impossible [in the basis]. 

When the appearance of the basis arises from that, there are two paths, liberation and delusion, that are produced from this appearance of the basis. Liberation arises from realizing the basis just as it is. Delusion arises from not realizing the basis. When the appearance of the basis arise, when one arrives at the liberation of the initial state of original purity, since realization is manifest buddhahood, the ten powers are actualized. Therefore, though the qualities of nirvana such as the ten powers and so on that do not exist in the basis exist as a primordial endowment, other than those who have reached the ultimate realization, buddhas, when even the bodhisattvas of the tenth bhumi cannot see the manifestation of all qualities, what need is there to mention ordinary sentient beings [being able to see them]? That being so, the difference between all the qualities of the basis being manifestly apparent or nonapparent is not from perspective of just the basis. [4/a] It is necessary to make a distinction in dependence on the appearances of a buddha, one who realizes the basis just as it is, and a sentient being, the one who does not realize that.

Hence we can see there is truly a great chasm between the view of gzhan stong and the view of Dzogchen.

There cannot be something free from extremes. 

Dolbupa's great middle way avoids extremes precisely in reverse of the way Tsongkhapa has it. For him freedom from extremes is arrived at in the following way. He tries to avoid eternalism by asserting that relative phenomena are never held to exist more than conventionally, being intrinsically empty; and he tries to avoid nihilism by asserting that ultimate phenomena are held to have always existed, being extrinsically empty. 

Here, what Longchenpa is referring to is the standard four fold negation of the extremes found every in sūtra on up to to the Dzogchen tantras, like the Realms and Dimensions of Sound Tantra [sgra thal 'gyur]:


The amazing, miraculous pristine consciousness
did not exist before, does not exist later, has not existed from the start;
is at present beyond all conceptual objects, 
having the nature of the emptiness that is free from extremes.

I am aware of this, and I find no solid backing for Kongtrul's views regarding Longchenpa in particular. 

As for Rangjung Dorje, he had an interesting approach to the three natures, but I don't really see how his writings show the same approach to the three natures as Dolbupa's and Tshan Khawoche. He also never uses the term 'gzhan stong" himself. The fact that in a 16th century commentary on the zab mo nang don one can read a defense of the Karmapa III as being a gzhan stong pa merely shows that this appellation is subject to doubt since it is not clear in his own writings.

Damn autocorrect....


All Mipham is saying is that there are two perspectives, how things are and how things appear. From the perspective of how things are, "it is necessary to propose that the universe and beings are primordial buddhahood and meditate in that way."

From the point of view of how things appear, the basis, path and result are divvied up by wisdom according their features: the basis concerns proving the validity of buddhahood. This is why, for example, we have the account of Samantabhadra's buddhahood and the account of the delusion of sentient beings. There is also a practice, and also the culmination of the purification of the delusion which gave rise to sentient beings in the first place. Since only deluded people are concerned with liberation, the path of Dzogchen is very much concerned with correcting the delusion that arises from ignorance [ma rig pa] by remaining in the knowledge [rig pa] of how things actually are, i.e. that the universe and beings are primordial buddhahood. 

We are not approaching practice from the point of view of accepting something that is not true, i.e., that the universe and beings are impure, etc. But we must acquiesce that this is indeed how things appear to us, and that as long as things appear in this way to us, we are under the influence of the two obscurations, which while temporary and not innate, conceal from us our actual state.

Well, I am not so sure they are helpful views at all; many argue that gzhan stong presents a distortion of the Yogacara school, and many argue that Gelug Madhyamaka presents a distortion of the Madhyamaka school. I don't think it is necessary at all to get involved with these Tibetan presentations of sūtrayāna tenets, especially because they involve issues that are never seen in the Indian milieu. It is really sufficient to practice Secret Mantra alone, since in any case its presentation of emptiness is superior to that of sūtra.

Whether one's view is eternalistic [like the gzhan stong pas, etc.], or annihilationistic [like the Gelugpas, etc.], as long as one is following the methods of Secret Mantra, it does not matter very much. But this does not mean as a consequence that people can feel free to disregard the consequences of conventional analysis, since then it would make no sense for Dzogchen tantras to exhaustively analyze various views for their deficiencies.

In other words, in sūtra, it very much matters whether one's post-equipoise view is in line with one's actual view in equipoise. In Mantra, it does not matter that much. Nevertheless, tenets are analyzed in Dzogchen and Mantra in general since these conceptual views prevent people from appreciating and experiencing the real view.

Yes, the summary by Jonang Kunga Drolchok, taken from Tsan Khawoche's book. 

Also, it is very important to remember that the Palpung version of gzhan stong was drawn from Jonang, via the Kathok master, Rigzin Tsewang, who then conferred the teaching on Situ Panchen, and it is this direct lineage that Kongtrul is heir. 

The whole gzhan stong project, beginning with Tshan Khawoche, was to reconcile the teachings of the three own natures with the the two truths of Madhyamaka, with a view towards proving that the former illuminated the latter with respect to the notion that buddha qualities are inherent and not newly developed on the path. 

incidentally, it may seem like I care deeply about this topic, but I don't. All of this stuff is sūtrayāna. If one is a Vajrayāna practitioner, it does not really matter much what view one holds conceptually, since that is not and never will be the real view. The real view is the view introduced by the guru, either in a formal empowerment or as a intimate instruction, and personally known for oneself.

The so called "primordial state" aka the original basis is called "the basis" because it has not been realized. When that is realized, it is given the name, "the result." "The path" is just the method of realizing that, which in the case of the Great Perfection, is the intimate instructions of the direct introduction and their application. 

Florin's point of view is influenced very much by "sems sde", which is primarily about the basis. Your point of view is more influenced by man ngag sde, which is more concerned with the methods of realizing that basis.

Another useful snippet from Mipham:

According to that principle, though from the perspective of ultimate reality it is necessary to propose that the universe and beings are primordial buddhahood and meditate in that way, from the perspective of the conventions of the mode of appearances, the differentiation by wisdom into three — the basis, the reasoning that buddhahood is valid; the path, the time of practice; and the result, the culmination of purification — are asserted up to the Great Perfection. Also the treatises of the Great Perfection purpose buddhahood once the fives paths of trekchö and the four visions of thögal are finished, but in terms of the mode of appearances, they never assert the accomplishment of buddhahood without finishing the path. When these two are differentiated, after the darkness of doubt about the topics that any of the vehicles of the cause and result have difficulty realizing, since there arises the appearance of confidence knowledge that cannot be diverted, this differentiation is very important.

It is pretty straightfoward according to Mipham:

In the realization of the Great Perfection that the three times are not time, there are no phenomena of the ten directions and three times that are not perfect. Therefore, this is the dharmakāya at the time of the basis, but because the temporary afflictions have not been purified it has not ripened into the nature of the result.

While maintaining the position, “This purification of any obscurations is the feature of the time of path. This total purification of obscurations is the feature of the time of the result,” is in accord with the mode of appearance of sentient beings, from the perspective of the mode of existence of dharmatā, it is not possible to move even slightly away from abiding in state of uniformity which lacks any divisions of dualistic phenomena such as division by three times, division into pure and impure, sentient beings and buddhas, and so on.


Thus, florin and krodha are both correct. Florin is correct from the point of view of mode of reality [gnas tshul], kyle is correct from the point of view of the mode of appearances [snang tshul] for sentient beings.

If you are, like Dolbupa, etc., going to claim a) claim that all five treatises of Maitreya are definitive and b) present a version of the doctrines contained in three of those source texts which is at great odds with the very source texts you claim to follow, it is quite likely that you are going to be taken to task for your exegetical excesses. When this is noticed, you cannot fault the person who is noticing this. That would be similar to blaming a reader for a spelling error in your own composition merely because he or she noticed you made a mistake. The main point is that the three own natures are used by gzhan stong to try and prove the ultimate is empty of the relative (a key doctrine of the gzhan stong view) and so on, deforming both Madhyamaka and Yogacara simultaneously.

Yes, his translation is certainly challenging. 

I hope at some point to bring out a new translation of this this text, as well as the second of the trilogy, An Investigation into the Meaning of the Luminous Original Mind, the Differentiation of the Basis, Path and Result of the Great Perfection entitled Illuminating Wisdom. 

The first text, which Hopkins translated, is very citation heavy; this text is very argument heavy, with not so many citations. The third text is a dated collection of various comments made over the years by Mipham on the subject, gathered into a single text. It is my hope to comb through that third text and present illuminating passages, perhaps as footnotes, which expand the topics in the first two texts. This is my present side project. I think that the gnyug sems skor gsum, aka the Trilogy on Original Mind, is a very important series of texts. In it, Mipham corrects many misconceptions about Dzogchen. One thing he especially attacks at length is the idea that the so-called "original mind" is a subtle mind, rather than what it actually is, the nature of the mind, whether that mind is subtle or coarse.

BTW, however challenging Hopkin's translations may be, he is to be highly commended for being the first to bring this into English, as well as Mountain Dharma by Dolbupa.

I don't have a problem with the Uttaratantra. I accept it as a definitive summary of the Buddha's teaching in sūtra, just as I accept Nāgārjuna's Madhyamaka as the definitive statement of Sūtra Mahāyāna Buddhist view. There is no contradiction between them. 

What I can't accept is 1) any hermeneutic based upon the so called three turnings of the wheel interpreted as historical epochs in the life of the Buddha, since this hermeneutic is directly contradicted by Maitryeanatha in the Sutralaṃkara 2.1, and thus is a still born hermeneutic; 2) I cannot accept the gzhan stong presentation of the three natures which is demonstrably distorted and incorrect. In other words, I do not accept the basic groundwork upon which the gzhan stong view is erected. 

To enlarge on the first point, there is no Indian source, none at all, for any of the various schemes to bracket this or that Mahāyāna sūtra into the second two turnings mentioned in the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra. Therefore, to say that the "Yogacara" sūtras belong the third turning, or the "Prajñāpāramita" Sūtras belong to the second, or the "Tathagātagarbha" Sūtras to the third etc., is entirely speculative. All we can say is that the Agamas belong to the first, and Mahāyāna sūtras belong to the second and third; but of the latter, we have no inkling of what sūtras are to be included in the second and third turnings, since as Maitreyanatha points out in the Sutrālaṃkara 2.1.a:

Not previously predicted, arising simultaneously...

And that is where we stand.

Moreover, the default attitude towards men in the justice system is based on the high incidence of men in the legal system being there because assault and rape are perpetrated by men on women. That being said, according to the Bureau of Justice itself, between 2006 and 2010 65 percent of all rapes and sexual assaults go unreported.

Sexism and racism are a function of power differentials. Sexism is not just biases like "A women's place is in the kitchen." That is too simplistic. 

Gender disparity includes all kinds of issues, like unrecognized household work, the fact that there are very few women in STEM occupations, which are 90% men; that professions where women dominate are sorely underpaid, and even then, women in these positions make less than their make counterparts. 

In order to prove that there is systematic sexism against men in our society, you would have to also demonstrate the power differentials through which such disparities happen. Claiming for example that most military casualties are male, for example, is a clear result of barring women from active combat duty until just a couple of weeks ago. 

There is no sexism against white men. There are consequences for white men, such as a diminishing power differential in our society that causes some white men to feel discriminated against, but anyone who thinks that there is sufficient gender parity in this society to make the claim that there is a serious problem of discrimination against men is just laughable, the sort of ignorant silliness one sees on Fox and Friends. 

And yes, there is a connection between racism and sexism, both are a result of patriarchy, so indeed sexism and racism do go hand in hand.

These negations are not necessarily understood the same way by everyone. But it has become fashionable to assume that the Gelug definition of a non-affirming negation is the one that is universally meant. For example, Rongzom clearly defines the affirming negation as a proof of your own position, whereas a non-affirming negation is the rejection of another's position. So for him, the Madhyamaka only uses the non-affirming negation, they do not use an affirming negation at all since they have no position to prove, viz existence or nonexistence. {He criticizes Madhyamaka however, also, for other reasons]. 

Basically both rang stong and gzhan stong are easily refuted just by looking at the MMK. The refutation of rang stong is:

If there were something subtle that was not empty there would be something subtle to be empty;
but as there is nothing not empty, where is there something to be empty? 

The refutation of gzhan stong is:

Since arising, abiding and ceasing are are not established, the conditioned is not established, 
if the conditioned is not established, how can the unconditioned be established?

There is no object of refutation not included in these two stanzas of the MMK, and they are unassailable. Simply put, gzhan stong is a view more crude than real Madhyamaka. It can be a stepping stone to a more subtle view, but it is not itself that subtle.

I think the entire usage of the three own natures is entirely problematical, and even though they interpret it differently than Maitreya, Asanga and Vasubandhu, it still causes their doctrine to be involved in internal contradictions. Longchenpa avoids these problems by adhering both to Prasanga Madhyamaka as the definitive view and the Tathāgatagarbha sūtras the definitive sūtras. 

I would not really consider Rangjung Dorje a gzhan stong pa. But he was one of the first Tibetans to use the three own natures novel ways in his texts. 

The other problem I have with gzhan stong is their overly dogmatic adherence to a historical scheme of the three turnings, a scheme which is not derived from Indian Buddhism at all, but rather from Wonho's vast commentary on the Samdhinirmocana Sūtra. There is absolutely no evidence that the tathāgatagarbha sūtras should be considered part of that turning at all. The only people who make this claim are Tibetans. I have done a lot of research in the canon on three turnings, and the way it is used by Buton on down basically is without any Indian precedent.

The Sakya position, at least as outlined by Gorampa, is that neither clarity nor emptiness can be considered suitable basis for tathāgatagarbha, i.e. a suitable basis for liberation. It can't be clarity, because in the Sakya system, clarity is considered conditioned; it can't be emptiness, because that would be the same as an arhat's cessation. The union of clarity and emptiness can be considered tathāgatagarbha because that union itself is unconditioned. But Gorampa would never admit that tathāgatagarbha is conditioned. To claim so is to contradict the Buddha directly. Why? For the simple reason that the tagāthagarbha is a just a name for dharmakāya encased in afflictions; but that dharmakāya is always unconditioned.

Specifically it was Mamo dances performed at a harvest festival. Nevertheless, to this day the main practice of the Khon remains Nyingma. The reason for this is that once Khon Khonchog Gyalpo buried all these Nyingma teachings in a stupa, he had a dream where the protectors told him to remove Kilaya and Yangdag from concealment and to maintain the practice in the Khon family in perpetuity. The main eight deity Sakya protectors also come from terma lineages, as witnessed by their inclusion in the Rinchen Terzö. \

So are we going to maintain that all of these formerly secret practices that have now been published, such as Mahamudra, Lamdre, Dzogchen, Kalacakra, Lama Chopa, etc., are all finished because their details can be found in any major library? I think not. The teachings of the Dharma do not not become ineffective because they are disseminated. They become ineffective, if, like medicine, they are not taken. 

In any case, what causes problems in the lineage is not publishing books, that is the least of it. Problems in a lineage come when a) the guru is not a qualified one, b) students fight with each other.

Right, but in sūtrayāna, they maintain that it is the merely the absence of inherent existence of things, a natural purity, for example, the way Gyaltsab Je describes it in his commentary in the Uttaratantra. 

There are also problems with Vajrayāna definition given by the Gelugpas, since this subtle mind is conditioned, whereas tathāgatagarbha is clearly unconditioned.

Well, they certainly lose their mystery. But this is not a bad thing. 

One, we have to recall that these texts were never secret from an elite set of people in India and Tibet. 

Second, we have to realize that tantras as texts are artifacts, books written down by human beings, with all the limitations that entails. 

Third, masters such as HHDL has said that tantric secrecy can actually be harmful to the teachings in the present epoch, because secrecy inspires fear. 

Fourth, texts like Dzogchen tantras are very tame in comparison with some of more "anti-nomian" Indian tantras. The former have virtually no erotic imagery, virtually no descriptions of rites of magic and sorcery, unlike say Hevajra or Kalacakra, or even Guhyasamaja and many of the lower tantras. If Dzogchen tantras were kept secret, it is because they present a narrative of liberation and buddhahood that is not consistent with the gradualist Buddhism that became the state religion of Tibet.

False view in Dzogchen is quite simply any view of existence or nonexistence. For example, the Self-Arisen Vidyā Tantra states:

Such false views as those
are held to be gathered into four:
tīrthikās, extremists, 
hedonists and cārvākas. 
The system of explaining these is as follows:
tīrthikās maintain permanent eternalism;
extremists maintain partial eternalism, partial annihilation;
hedonists maintain that annihilation is total annihilation;
Cārvākas maintain the annihilation of karmic results.

As such, the three hundred and sixty views as well
can be gathered into four categories. 
Further those can be included
in eternalism and annihilationism. 
Those can also be included in meaningless nihilism.
This is the extent of the worldly views.

No. If buddhas appear "apropos" of people's karma, that means buddhas are just delusions. Indeed, as Vidyādhara Mañjuśrimitra wrote in his seminal Meditation of Bodhicitta:

Because the awakening of the sugata does not exist, his magical apparitions appear to the deluded, similar to an illusion. 

For those of you who do not know who Mañjuśrimitra was, he was Vidyādhara Garab Dorje's main disciple, credited with dividing Dzogchen tantras into three series according to emphasis.

So, therefore, the two truths, and the whole gzhan stong/rang stong debate along with them, remains completely irrelevant to Dzogchen.

The title, Myriad Worlds, is a western title, not Kongtrul's title. It is just the first part of the Shes Bya Mdzod, lit., The Treasury of the Knowable. 

Now then, if we take your line of reasoning, that the whole book is about the basis, how do you cope with the absurd consequence that Vajrasana, Vulture Peak, will exist in the basis, but the rest of the world will not? [see 143].

Instead, the notion of a basis [gzhi] is really only brought up in chapter iv. It begins on 173 by saying:

It is taught in scriptures that worlds and beings
Are created by various actions influenced by subtle and proliferation [emotions].

He then continues by listing the various approaches to the how the world and beings are created in various tenet systems. He then gives the Kalacakara account on 176:

"Most agree that in the formation [of the world], the mind is the agent..."

This whole section, up to page 181, takes the individual mind as the basis for the formation of the universe. 

He the shifts to Hinayāna and Mahāyāna cosmology from 182 until 195.

He then introduces what he terms the ultimate view concerning the origin of samsara and the Dzogchen view. 

The first is a detailed presentation of dependent origination. On 198, in the section on the relationship between dependent origination and the eight consciousnesses, he writes:

"The beginningless nature of the mind is clear, empty, [and] unobstructed,
but its nature is not recognized... 

Thus far, the basis described in the whole book is the mind or the nature of the mind. 

It is only at the conclusion of this section that Kongtrul begins a description of the Dzogchen teaching on the basis. And there is nothing there which validates your interpretation that it is a so called transpersonal basis.

The basis is nothing other than the self-originated pristine consciousness mentioned above. Also the ignorance that gives rise to the eight consciousnesses, etc. is just the ignorance [ma rig pa] which is the manifestation of rig pa itself, as mentioned on 215. So for example, he states on 222 that the five wisdoms of rig pa manifest as the five aggregates and so on. Not the five aggregates of all sentient beings, just your own five aggregates. Likewise, they then arise as the five afflictions, etc. Paragraph 2 on pg. 224., summarizes the six sets of five that arise from and are present in rig pa.

I don't see how this could possibly apply to so called sems sde texts. The rhetoric of "bodhicitta" in sems sde is identical to that found for example in the Guhyasamaja. 

Second, we have no evidence whatsoever of any thögal like teachings being written down by anyone until the early 11th century, whether Buddhist or Bon. 

In terms of unique doctrines, the most unique thing in Bonpo Dzogchen is ZZNG's emphasis on sounds, lights and rays, which really only figures in the ZZNG, and it pretty much absent from other Bonpo Dzogchen cycles, based on a electronic word search conducted on the other two main cycles of Dzogchen in Bon. 

While I would have no complaints about sourcing Dzogchen in Central Asia, within the sphere of Indian cultural influence, I see absolutely no evidence which links Dzogchen doctrines with teachings generally outside of Buddhadharma and the Indian context.

You should read Nozick, Anarchy, State and Utopia, where he sets out the minimum conditions for a state, and why this is more desirable than anarchy. 

We have discharged our task of explaining how a state would arise from a state of nature without anyone’s rights being violated. The moral objections of the individualist anarchist to the minimal state are overcome. It is not an unjust imposition of a monopoly; the de facto monopoly grows by an invisible-hand process and by morally permissible means, without anyone’s rights being violated and without any claims being made to a special right that others do not possess. And requiring the clients of the de facto monopoly to pay for the protection of those they prohibit from self-help enforcement against them, far from being immoral, is morally required by the principle of compensation adumbrated in Chapter 4.

Depends on what you mean by old. Chronologically, it is a terma that was probably revealed during the 13th century.

However, the Khandro Nyingthig is a self-described commentary on it, and since it dates to the early 14th, it is a good guess that this tantra was revealed in the 13th. It seems the first cycle of teachings that mention its existence is the Khandro Nyinthig. Also, in the 14th century, Dorje Lingpa revealed further tantras with similar names.

No, this is not accurate. 

Another form of contraception approved by the FDA – the copper Intrauterine Device CuT380A (Cu-IUD) – is effective as an EC when inserted up to five days following intercourse. Copper ions released from the IUD create an environment that is toxic to sperm, preventing fertilization.14 Copper can also alter the endometrial lining, but studies show that this alteration can prevent implantation, but not disrupt implantation. Because Cu-IUDs prevent rather than disrupt pregnancy, they too are properly classified as contraceptives, not abortifacients.

In other words, IUD's create a situation where the sperm is basically poisoned.

Chapters sixty-two through through eighty-eight describe all of the preliminaries from contemplating the time of death through the separation of samsara and nirvana. Chapter eighty-nine explains the secret empowerment, and ninety covers creation and completion, while chapters ninety-one through ninety-eight cover trekchö. Chapter ninety-nine covers the third empowerment and the practice connected with passion. The rest of the tantra concerns thogal. In other words, the tantra maps various practices in relation with the four empowerments — elaborate, unelaborate, very unelaborate and extremely unelaborate. 

So what are the first sixty chapters about? All kinds of things. Chapters 1-46 are concerned exclusively with Dzogchen theory. Chapters 47-60 are all about the guru and disciple and conditions for transmission.

You are not asking the right question -- of course, for sentient beings there are images in the mirror. As our friend here reminds us, we are not trying to recognize the mirror, we are the mirror. Whether or not there are appearances in the mirror, the nature of the mirror, its potential, always can reflect. That is what we are interested, not the status of the images, if there are any.

Od' sal taught for example in the Jñānavajrasammucaya tantra is the same thing we are discussingL:

That which arises from luminosity
is “mind,” [citta] “intellect,” [manas] and consciousness” [vijñāna]
which forms the foundation of all phenomena.

And:

Further, luminosity is nonabiding,
does not cease nor does it arise,
ultimate, the limit of reality. 


Here, in order to explain the reality [gnas lugs] of all phenomena, since that which arises from luminosity is a nonconceptual knowing awareness arising (at the same time as a subtle vāyu) from dharmatā, the dhātu of naturally pure luminosity, the mind is the basis of everything [aḹaya, kun gzhi]. The mental consciousness [manovijñāna] expands and contracts. Consciousness possesses an eight-fold group. 

The foundation of all phenomena is bodhicitta, an unchanging vajra that is equal with space.

This is basically the same thing that Dzogchen is getting at, with the difference that here in this tantra, bodhicitta is defined as the union of the relative and ultimate. Dzogchen however dispenses with the distinction altogether, regarding it as a deviation. An ancient commentary found in the Bairo brgyud 'bum on The Soaring Great Garuda [one of the five earlier extracts translated by Vairocana] explains:

[T]o demonstrate the deviation of madhyamaka: here, since the two truths have been inseparable from the beginning, the two truths are not presented individually even conventionally. Having divided up the dharmatā and dharmin into relative and ultimate, training in the ultimate as supreme is the deviation of madhyamaka, as it is said:

Since phenomena and nonphenomena have always been merged and are inseparable,
there is no further need to explain an “ultimate phenomenon”.



Needless to say, the luminosity discussed above is not the luminosity discussed in the completion stage of the Guhyasamaja.

"From the beginning, the sudden approach is to train on the non-arising ultimate without alternating [with relative truth]."

Abandon bias and concepts about the real. If one remains vividly, neither self nor other exists, commoners and āryas are equivalent and the same.If one remains in unchanging stability, from then, on do not follow letters and scriptures.

Great Tantra Clarifying The Meaning of Freedom From Proliferation states:

In the context of explaining the illustrative examples of that basis, it is said to be empty and pervasive like space; immaculate like a crystal; unchanging like a vajra; the source of all blessings like a jewel; unimpeded illumination like the heart of the sun and so on. It is the opposite of ignorance [avidyā] and inertness, existing as nature of a veridical consciousness, it is knowledge [vidyā]. Since it is beyond cause and condition, it is self-originated. Since it does not arise adventitiously, it is the pristine consciousness that has become the nature of the vidyā that has always existed. It is the basis from which all samsara and nirvana appear.


Self-originated pristine consciousness is nondual emptiness and knowingness, termed "the nondual dharmadhātu and vidyā." Pristine consciousness [ye shes, jn̄āna] is the core of the mind, self-arisen, unconditioned, uncontaminated, unaffected by the three times. When it is not recognized, then through that ignorance its potentiality becomes mind, dependent origination and all the phenomena of samsara. When it is recognized, one is the peer of Buddha Samantabhadra.

No, because dependent origination starts from not seeing your own state. 

Many followers of Dharma perceive dependent origination to be an external fact or law that governs the production of phenomena. 

But from a Dzogchen point of view, dependent origination only begins from the phase of ignorance called the imputing ignorance [kun brtags ma rig pa]. Prior to this, there is no dependent origination to speak of. For example, for a buddha who sees things just as they are, there is no dependent origination at all. The Guhyagarbha states:

Buddhas themselves never find
a phenomena other than buddhahood.

Since there is nothing to designate as being produced from a cause or generated by condition because the great emptiness that has always been self-originated is intrinsically luminous, it is self-originated pristine consciousness. That is the mind of dharmatā or the luminous pristine consciousness.

The Tantra Gathering The Definitive Meaning Of The Great Perfection states:

Due to the three times existing in the mind, 
before, after, and present occur in life. 
Due to transmigrating existing in the mind, 
therefore, birth and death arise for the body. 
Due to various illness, happiness and suffering
being one’s mind, it ripens as samsara. 
Therefore, the mind is not buddha...
Unrealized confused people
claim “the dharmakāya is my mind.”
Therefore, other than the words, they do not understand the meaning.

This latter term "individually selfcognizant wisdom" is incorrectly translated. The term is so sor rang gi rig pa'i ye shes or pratyatmyavedanajñāna. 

There is an important citation in the Inlaid Jewels Tantra that clarifies the difference between these two:

Untainted vidyā is the kāya of pristine consciousness. 
Since intrinsic knowing [rang rig, svasaṃvedana] is devoid of actual signs of awakening, 
it is not at all the pristine consciousness of vidyā [rig pa'i ye shes].

No, it is not the same as the Yogacara concept, they hold that as truly existent, albeit empty of subject and object, as Mipham says here in Liquid Gold:

The Cittamatrins deconstruct both subject and object in a mere empty intrinsically knowing pristine consciousness. 

The difference is, as he says:

When the pairing of the dhātu and vidyā is deconstructed, there is no focal point upon which to grasp. Once it is understood that the final premise, “this is ultimate,” is deconstructed in the state of inexpressible emptiness, one enters into the nondual pristine consciousness that all phenomena of the inseparable two truths are of the same taste.

Actually, Mipham addresses this. One, the problem is what is meant by "view." In the Commentary On Liquid Gold he states:

Though all the objects of analysis of other kinds of analysis are doors for getting near pristine conciseness, pristine consciousness cannot be seen with them in and of themselves. All the activity of intellectual analysis obscures the pristine consciousness that is beyond thought by shackling it in the web of mind, just as a caterpillar spins its own cocoon. 

He continues later by stating:

In the same way, when examined from the perspective of the emptiness that is free from all proliferation of the four extremes that is explained in the Perfection Vehicle, since there are no phenomena not pervaded by that emptiness, there indeed is a good argument that confirms that if there is a view better than that, that view would become a proliferation.

However, when examined from the perspective of realizing the dhātu (the object to be realized), or the method (great bliss), the view of mantra is very superior because the mind is very near the reality of the object [the dharmadhātu].

Why is the mind very near the reality of the object? After the first statement I presented above, Mipham claims:

Here [in the Great Perfection], since the pristine consciousness that exists within oneself is immediately apprehended just as it is with the intimate instruction of the critical point of the introduction, it becomes intrinsically clear to oneself without the need to be involved in a huge net of conceptual fabrications. That being so, once the result of all progress is attained, there is no rationale in hoping for another vehicle.

Thus the view in Dzogchen is the direct perception of pristine consciousness introduced by the guru, it is not a result of intellectual analysis.

It means simply that the appearance of the insentient and the sentient is a delusion, and that in reality there is no such distinction at all. This is why I replied to Rita's question, "I've read some references to insentient life being enlightened. What does this mean?" with "Nothing." From a Dzogchen point of view it is meaningless to say that the insentient, living or otherwise, becomes enlightened since the categories of insentient/sentient are themselves predicated on a dualistic error and vanish in the state of buddhahood.

We have been over this before. There is no doubt that the message of the Lotus Sutra is that women can become Buddhas. Nevertheless, the Nāga princess changes her gender to male, and then proceeds to Buddhahood. She does not attain Buddhahood in a female form:

At that time the members of the assembly all saw the dragon girl in the space of an instant change into a man and carry out all the practices of a bodhisattva, immediately proceeding to the Spotless World of the south, taking a seat on a jeweled lotus, and attaining impartial and correct enlightenment. With the thirty-two features and the eighty characteristics, he expounded the wonderful Law for all living beings everywhere in the ten directions.

Then the assembly there all saw the daughter of the nāga king instantly transform into a man, perfect the bodhisattva practices, go to the vimalā world in the south, sit on a jeweled lotus flower, and attain highest, complete enlightenment, become endowed with the thirty-two marks and eighty excellent characteristics, and expound the True Dharma universally for the sake of all sentient beings in the ten directions.

It is just a mirror — it will reflect a golden Buddha statue or a golden bedpan with equal indifference. It will not discriminate this image and say "This is sacred" and reflect it more brightly, nor will it discriminate another image and say, "This is profane" and dim the image. The mirror reflects everything equally well without discriminating whether it is good or bad, large or small, etc. Why? Because the function of a mirror is to reflect anything placed before it.

Even if one believes that every word in the sūtras was spoken by the Buddha, this does not mean they all need to be accepted. Otherwise we are no better than fundamentalist theists who insist that every word of their holy scriptures was spoken by God. 

In any case, since the appearance of Buddhas and the words that they speak are delusions conforming to the expectations and inclinations of those to be tamed, if the Buddhas enunciate sexist things, it is the flaw of the disciple to be tamed, not the Buddhas. Even if this is the case however, and we use this a rationale to excuse the Buddhas of culpability for such words and attitudes, those words and attitudes must still be confronted, not wished away with platitudes and vain apologetics. 

That said, when we find things in the sūtras and tantras that are injurious to our sisters in the Dharma, they should be confronted, no matter who is supposed to have said them.

Quite honestly, the word never crosses my lips nor comes to mind with regard to the Dharma. I think in terms of what is liberative and nonliberative. I don't think that there really is anything in Buddhadharma that is "inviolable", "sacrosanct", etc. In fact, I think the term "sacred" is pretty dualistic. In order for something to be sacred, there has to something profane. 

Of course I respect what other people hold to be "sacred," as long as it is not harmful to sentient beings. But since all phenomena are already perfect, where is there any room at all for the sacred or the profane? If you argue that we don't live in such knowledge and therefore, it is important that we have "sacred texts," "sacred rites," etc., you have just rendered your "sacred rites and texts" profane and mundane since they are only relevant to the ignorant and deluded.

But Europeans were so callous in their disregard to the First Peoples here, they willing wrote down accounts of murder and pillage without a second thought. 

Documented policies of genocide on the part of US administrations can be identified in at least four distinct periods: the Jacksonian era of forced removal; the California gold rush in Northern California; the post– Civil War era of the so-called Indian wars in the Great Plains; and the 1950s termination period, all of which are discussed in the following chapters. Cases of genocide carried out as policy may be found in historical documents as well as in the oral histories of Indigenous communities. An example from 1873 is typical, with General William T. Sherman writing, “We must act with vindictive earnestness against the Sioux, even to their extermination, men, women and children … during an assault, the soldiers can not pause to distinguish between male and female, or even discriminate as to age.” As Patrick Wolfe has noted, the peculiarity of settler colonialism is that the goal is elimination of Indigenous populations in order to make land available to settlers. That project is not limited to government policy, but rather involves all kinds of agencies, voluntary militias, and the settlers themselves acting on their own.

That which is considered inviolable is that which considered sacred: a shrine, a trust, a place, a word, bond, etc., generally because it has been blessed, but also because there may be some inherent quality which some place or thing seems to hold: such as a tree, a mountain, a spring, a river and so on., which will be ruined if it is despoiled. 

The thing is, there is no adjective like "sacred" in Dharma texts (with perhaps the possible exception of brahma, i.e. brahmacarin, etc.) This, I submit, accounts for why there is so much disagreement among Western Buddhists about what is sacred and what is not, precisely because there is very little guidance on the subject from key source texts.

Meanings are invented, consensual and conventional. 

As for your second sentence, it is very questionable that metaphysical naturalism is necessarily grounded in utilitarianism —&nbsp;I think you are making too broad a claim. For example, take this definition in which there is no species of utilitarianism mentioned:

Naturalism, in recent usage, is a species of philosophical monism according to which whatever exists or happens is natural in the sense of being susceptible to explanation through methods which, although paradigmatically exemplified in the natural sciences, are continuous from domain to domain of objects and events. Hence, naturalism is polemically defined as repudiating the view that there exists or could exist any entities which lie, in principle, beyond the scope of scientific explanation.

Buddhadharma [and Jaindharma] in this respect is also a species of metaphysical naturalism —&nbsp;in Buddhadharma there is no mystery precisely because "whatever exists or happens is natural"  and there does not exist nor could exist "any entities which lie, in principle, beyond the scope of Dharma explanation."

In other religions however [sans philosophical Taoism and Confucism], there is a profound mystery, God, through whose agency all things are created. 

Indeed, this is one of the reasons why Buddhadharma is so appealing to westerners with liberal educations. The naturalism of Buddhadharma and philosophical Taoism fit well into our already metaphysically naturalist predilections. 

HH Dalai Lama exemplifies this view with his confidence that indeed science can explain confirm, and justify any and all Buddhist beliefs, but even more than that, he recommends abandoning any Buddhist tenets that are directly contradicted by scientific explanation and found to be definitely false from a scientific point of view.

This is quite patronizing. All people have an intuitive sense of their own rights and the rights of others, they do not need to be "taught", nor do they "mimick" once they have been taught.

Rights are inviolable and inalienable [i.e. inherent], and do not depend on being granted by some deity —&nbsp;a deity, who in any case, a large majority of the leaders of the American revolution did not believe in at all.

And as Nāgārjuna points out, "arising from causes" is incoherent.
