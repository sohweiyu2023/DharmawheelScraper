FYI, the body of light is an option, not a certainty, and as the Buddha pointed out in the Vajracchedika, and as Rongzom Pandita cites, if you think you can see a tathāgata by virtue of their signs, you are very mistaken.

Liberal Democracy never aimed at creating an enlightened society at all. It aimed a creating a society that was based on the recognition of common rights of human beings. Fortunately, its premises allowed the notion of who was a human being to expand, and thus under Liberal Democracy, rights have been increasingly extended towards those whose rights were not recognized under its original formulation. But the creation of an enlightened society was never at its base. Fascism and Socialism, on the other hand, have pretensions towards transcendence and enlightenment.

"Crazy wisdom" is exclusive to Tibetan Buddhism. It was a term coined by Trungpa. It is pretty modern. 

The idea that one must tolerate unusual behavior from one's guru is well established. What is not so well established is that converts tend to bring a certain fanaticism with them into the new faith to which they have converted. Is this idealism exploited? Yes, but this is little different than new recruits in an army who suffer all kinds of abuse at the hands of the powers that be to turn them into malleable foot soldiers. So, I still argue that power and its abuse is the real issue here, and claims of "Cultishness" are a distracting red herring.

It is not surprising at all that Trungpa created an army, the Vajra Guard, and that it remains the chief expression of Shambhala International's will to power. Attempts to create enlightened societies always end in tears.

There has always been room for Mahāyāna teachers to engage in conduct that seems to not conform to lower Buddhist ethics. Of course, some people use this laxity as an excuse to indulge their afflictions. This is not the intention of the situational ethics of Mahāyāna. 

We should not differentiate this kind of behavior engaged in by religious leaders from the same behavior committed by people in secular settings. When we find the same kind of behavior happening in corporate settings, we don't label such behavior "cult behavior." We call it what it is: abuse of power. 

 The behavior of Harvey Wienstein, etc., and Osel Mukpo, Sogyal, Trungpa, Joshu Sasaki, Eido Shimano, etc., was aided and abetted at all levels by people who depended upon them for power, money, or status, or all three.

They pick the teachers with whom they have karma, qualifications actually have very little to do with it. 

If you do not have the karma to study with this or that "highly qualified" lama, no matter what you do, you will never be able to attend their teachings. It is sort of like the conception of a child. If the gandhavara, the bardo being, does not have proper karma with a certain set of parents, there is no basis for a conception. 

Nothing we say about this woman has any relevance to her or her students. She found a Tibetan lama to back her, learned Tibetan, gained academic credentials, etc. In order to question her credentials, you have to question his, and so on and so forth. 

In the end, it all comes down to what oneself accepts and rejects. 

The tantras do not say, "Examine master so and so for his lineage recognitions, endorsements, associates, etc." What do they say? They mention nothing about lineage heads, etc.  They only mention the personal qualities and learning of the prospective master in question.

Tsuglag Trengwa (Gtsug lag 'phreng ba 1504-1566) writes in his Feast For Paṇḍitas (mkhas pa'i dga' ston):


A billion fields of Kusumatalagarbhālaṃkara 
exists in each pore
of Vairocanasagara. 
Every particle of his body is similar.
Every particle of that field is as numerous. 
Vairocana is the sambhogakāya
of Śākyamuni. 
Where ever that kāya and buddhafield reside,
that buddhafield combines all into one,
said to be the field of every sambhogakāya. 
In this manner, where ever space pervades, 
also the buddhafield and kāya of the victor exists.
In the absolute definitive meaning, however,
the kāya and buddhafield
are immeasurable, and no limit can be apprehended.

The above is standard late Indian Buddhist cosmology, and has come to be the standard Mahāyāna cosmology of Tibet. 

You can search how it is treated in Chinese Buddhism with this:

There are a billion planets in the Sahaloka. Each planet has a Mt. Meru, 4 continents, sun and moon., etc.

If the manifestations are impermanent, how can wisdom be permanent? A permanent entity (wisdom) can not give rise to an impermanent manifestation (display). Further, if wisdom is free from the four extremes, also its product, the display, must be free from the four extremes, not established in any way, being itself similar to an illusion or a mirage. 

Further, you make it sound as if there are two phases: being in the dzogchen state and not being in the dzogchen state. Since there is nothing that is not in the dzogchen state, how can there be a phase of being in the dzogchen state and not being in the dzogchen state?

ChNN asserts that these substances "charge one's energy," meaning in translation, cause a disturbance or agitation in one's rlung. An ordinary person cannot maintain one pointedness if their rlung is disturbed. If the rlung is agitated, the mind will be agitated. Agitation is actually a product of excess rlung, just as lethargy is a produce of deficient rlung.

A pratyakṣa (mngon sum) is a simple impression upon the senses, a direct perception or a cognition, take your pick, since they are synonyms. These are defined as nonconceptual in Buddhadharma. Since you are posting in the Dzogchen forum, you need to understand this word and concept is critically important in Dzogchen teachings, as well as important in Buddhadharma in general. For example, the direct, nonconceptual cognition of the ultimate truth is called yogapratyakṣa, yogic direct perception, etc. 

Concepts are assembled out of these direct perceptions by the mental factors. For example, in the first moment of observing a blue cup, there is no concept of cup or blue, etc, there is only a naked cognition of a blue shape. The fact that one is perceiving a blue cup is assembled by the samjñā skandha. The vijñāna skandha is always nonconceptual consciousness by nature.

Depends on whether one is discussing things from the point of view of the relative or the ultimate. And before you go tossing out the two truths, the Mdo bcu states:

By means of relative words and syllables
the ultimate is realized to be inexpressible,
therefore, the relative and ultimate are connected.

This is identical to what Nāgarjuna states about the relation between the relative and ultimate in MMK. Also the Kun byed rgyal po states:

By means of both the ultimate and the relative
both the definitive scriptures and the provisional scriptures
are explained with example, meaning, logical sign, and argument.

These are part of throwing karma, but the actual sensations we feel in these existences that are a result of karma are differentiated on the basis of whether their cause is virtuous or nonvirtue, and all nonvirtue ripens as pain in the body and all virtue ripens as pleasant feelings in the mind.

This is one reason that in Tibetan Medicine, for example, mental suffering is dealt with as a physical problem.

IN general, karma that ripens on the body is only nonvirtuous karma, resulting in pain. The karma that ripens on the mind is only positive karma, resulting in happiness. 

I am pretty sure that a cat suffering from a great amount of pain, near death but not quite there, would still resist your attempts to kill it, as would every creature. 

So in general, I am pretty sure euthanizing pets, for example, is not a course I would recommend. However, if an animal is rabid, there is little choice in the matter. I don't think there is any reasonable objection to killing diseased animals or animals that carry diseases harmful to humans, such as mosquitos, ticks, and so on. This is just common sense.

In Buddhist thinking, continuity is only accounted for by the logic of "neither the same nor different." For example, if a seed as utterly different than a sprout, there is no causal relationship between the two; so they cannot be utterly different. Since sprout will not arise if it is the same as the seed, a seed and a sprout cannot be the same.

But that is not what happens in your use of the tetralemma, you just make four mutually exclusive statements. You do not end up in inconceivability, you end up with four propositions about a rock. You'd get laughed out of Nalanda. 

Your use is like this: "A rock is water; a rock is not water; a rock is both water and not water; a rock is neither water nor not water." These are not four negations, which is what the tetralemma is supposed to be. These are four affirmations. 

A proper tetralemma is, for example, the tetralemma that refutes arising in the MMK:

An existence does not arise from an existent. 
An existent does not arise from a nonexistent. 
A nonexistent does not arise from an existent. 
A nonexistent does not arise from a nonexistent. 
Where can there be arising? 

This kind of properly formed tetralemma results inexpressibility/inconceivability because it leads one to it through negation, not through affirmation.

This is a non-argument. You can certainly call a dog a lion, but it will never roar, only bark. Diachronic changes in language do not impact the argument that conventions are called conventions because they describe functions. For example, we call an assemblage of mechanical parts a car due to its function, not because we think there is some ultimate carness. You can call it a motorized buggy, etc., but the point is that a car is car because it functions like a car. A rock or a stone, or whatever you want to call a mineral composite does not have buddhanature because it is not the function of a rock to attain buddhahood since a rock has no mind and is not sentient. A sentient being has a mind, and so is capable of the function of attaining buddhahood, not because there is some ultimate buddhaness. If there were ultimate buddhaness then we could claim that rocks have buddhanature. There is no ultimate buddhaness, thus, claiming a rock has buddhanature is no better than asserting that water is dry.

Because otherwise, as pointed out in the Samdhinirmocana sūtra, if one does not make a distinction, all nonveridical cognitions become cognitions of the ultimate, and this is a very negative consequence. It is not as simple as the summary statement makes it seem. The Buddha explain four reasons why stating the ultimate and relative are the absolutely same are faulty, as well as four reasons why stating they are absolutely different is faulty; but in reality, the first four faults are more grave than the latter four.

An example of a convention is something which is functional in the world. Arguments which do not stand up to convention are false arguments. 

Claiming that a rock has buddhanature violates convention because rocks do not have minds. It is that simple. 

For example, claiming that water is dry is a violation of convention; claiming there are four moons in the August night sky on planet Earth is a violation of convention; claiming that the pink elephants you see because of detoxing on alcohol are real is a violation of convention.

Your statement suffers from the problem of not distinguishing dharmin and dharmatā. While one cannot claim that dharmin and dharmatā, in this case a rock and its suchness, are absolutely different, neither can one claim they are identical. 

The Buddha discusses this problem in detail in the Samdhinirmocana Sūtra, in Chapter Three. One must distinguish between the ultimate and the compounded, but this does not mean they have no relation, like a sun and its rays. As the Buddha says in the Samdhinirmocana, the ultimate is the general characteristic (samanyalakṣana) of the relative. 

However, it is a category error to assert that the ultimate is the specific characteristic (svalakṣana) of a given relative entity. But even worse, if you assert the identity proposition "rocks are suchness," you are asserting that a compounded thing, a rock, is ultimate. That makes you a realist. 

The Buddha asserts that stating an absolutely identity or difference between the ultimate and the relative are both problematical. He concludes this chapter by stating:

The characteristic of compounded entities and the ultimate
is the characteristic of being neither the same nor different; 
those who conceive sameness and difference
are improperly oriented. 

On the other hand, the Buddha states nowhere that making conventional distinctions between dharmin and dharmatā is similarly fraught. In fact, as you know, Nāgārjuna points out that it is a great fault not to recognize the distinction between the two truths.

Yes, in fact Wonchuk does avow the authenticity of the Sanskrit copy with which he is familiar by pointing out flaws in the earlier translation at his disposal. This itself is a testimony to the fact that Wongchuk regards the text as authentic. If he did not think it authentic, he never would have bother composing a commentary. Esteemed paṇḍitas like Wongchuk don't waste their time writing commentaries on texts they regard as of questionable provenance. There is also the fact that he addresses the Heart Sūtra in his commentary on the Saṃdhinirmocana Sūtra when he discusses the different names used at the beginning of sūtras:

Some are also called by two names, such as the Mtshams sbyor rnam par grol ba'i mdo (unidentified) and Prajñāpāramitā-hṛdaya...The Prajñāpāramitā-hṛdaya is called two names [Bhagavāti and Prajñāpāramitāhridaya] because the compiler condensed it from the extensive texts.


Here, the sdud pa po, the compiler, refers to the hearer, "Thus have I heard...", i.e. Ananda. Whether we accept this or not, for Wonchuk, this text was compiled out of the extensive PP literature by Ananda himself.

A thought is a concept. Buddhahood is by definition free of concepts. Nevertheless, even concepts also have suchness. If one realizes the dharmatā of a concept, then one can say the seat of awakening can be found in a concept; but if one does not realize the dharmatā of a concept, one cannot say that the seat of awakening can be found in a concept. 

Any given entity can be can be the object of a veridical perception that accords with suchness, or the object of a non-veridical perception that does not accord with suchness. But the same perception cannot be both veridical, in accordance with suchness, and non-veridical, not in accordance with-- it must one or the other.

Dogen was fully within the Tientai tradition, philosophically speaking, so that makes his ideas less radical then they appear on first glance. 

Then the second problem one has to parse is what exactly does on mean by "buddhanature," if not tathāgatagarbha?

If by buddhanature, one means that everything is awakened intrinsically, then one has to parse exactly what awakening means, if not the absence of afflictions through insight into the reality of things.

There is no doubt that in South India, on the eastern side, Andra Pradesh there was considerable Mahāyāna activity.

What it at issue is the location of Oḍḍiyāna, and the northwest corner of India has always been considered the location of Dakinis, perhaps because in that region there were many people with red hair, a legacy of Alexander.

It certainly does not correspond with the Longde histories on the location of Oḍḍyāna. One, it holds Garab Dorje was a central Indian:

Now then, there was a Dharma protecting king of the Śākya clan named *Vimalacuḍa Śākyabhadra, his queen, Sublime (Dam pa). They gave birth to very beautiful and radiant daughter who has very attractive and entrancing. Her name in Sanskrit was Sarani.

Second it holds that Oḍḍyāna was to the west:

When Garab Dorje reached eight years, he said, “Mother, you are happy here. To the west of here in the land of Oḍḍiyāna is Dhanakośa Island on the shores of the great outer ocean. 


Third, there is the testimony of Orgyenpa Rinchenpal who visited Oḍḍiyāna in person in the 13th century. In order to get to Oḍḍiyāna he first traveled to Jalandhara in the Punjab. Oḍḍiyāna is described as being to the northwest of that city, and at the time of the thirteenth century, is described as being dominated by "Mongolians" speaking a Tajik language. 

In fact, as far as I can tell, Oḍḍiyāna is the Tibetan name for the region of Pakistan in general.  

Moreover, the Chinese traveler Faxian travelled to a place called Udyān, north of Peshwar, where people practiced mantra and what he considered a debased form of Mahāyāna. 

Also it does not correspond with seven line prayer.

The Missing Foundation was an industrial music band. KMFDM used to be part of that band for a short while. Pretty horrendous music. They were four guys. Not an anarchist collective. They were involved with anti-gentrfication movement.

As of 2005, Missing was a homeless guy in NYC.

There must be civil disobedience against these assemblies of fascists, and these people ought to be met in the street. If they provoke violence, which in fact is their chief aim, people have a right to defend themselves and those around them, as a recent court case connected with Charlottesville found. 

Now, if a nazi feels they've been unfairly punched in the face, give them their day in court so the full, disgusting facts of their perverted beliefs can be aired, as also happened in Charlottesville. I think they will have a hard time finding a jury willing to convict the assailant in many places in the US.

So, I am glad that Antifa shows up and shows that in the America, fascists do not get a pass. Their views are noxious, and in my opinion, are not protected speech when they are brought into the commons. If people wish to have sick Hitlerian fantasies in their double wides and chatrooms, I can't do anything about that. But at least we can keep their hateful speech out of public spaces. And until our legal system catches up with the 21st century, until that time I an glad there is a solid Anti-Fascist movement in this country, just as there was in the 1920's and 30's, when the ugly face of Fascism first reared its head in the world.

You did not understand correctly. The 18 Sem sde lungs are present in Tibet from the late 8th and early 9th century. The Kun byed rgyal po is probably not a translation, but a compilation and expansion of the five sems sde lungs. The rmad du 'byung ba tantra is similar, but ancient. There are many other Dzgchen tantras that were written down in the 9th and 10th century, but dating them is difficult. 

Then there is the Brahmin cycle, revealed as terma during the late tenth, early eleventh. 

Atisha seems to have passed around 1055. The 17 tantras were revealed 15 or 20 years before this date. According to tradition, the seventeen tantras were concealed in a temple about 30k north of Lhasa by Nyangban Tingzin Zangpo. The oral lineage was passed on separately from the texts. These were reunited when Dangma Lhungyal removed the 17 tantras from their place of concealment. He then passed the texts onto Chetsun Senge Wangchuk around 1065. Senge Wangchuk in turn transmitted them to Chegom Nagpo. Chegom Nagpo transmitted them to Zhangton Tashi Dorje in roughly 1108. Zhangton revealed the Vima Nyinthik when he was 21, in roughly 1118. 

According to the Nyingthig history, Atisha attained his realization through practicing Dzogchen, actually.

This is true. As a lineage, only they have preserved the entire creation and completion stage teachings as an integral whole. The Gelugpas preserve Kalacakra more as a state ritual. If one is seriously interested in Kalacakra, one must study the Jonang lineage of Kalacakra. Of course, that exists outside Jonang, HH Chogye Trichen, the late head of the Tsarpa subschool of Sakya, was expert in this lineage, as was Kalu Rinpoche. The Jonang lineage of Kalacakra spread from Jonang to Nyingma in the 18th century, then to Kagyu and then from Kongtrul, into all schools. However, outside of Jonang, there is little practice of the complete system. So your best bet to study this system in its entirety is to find a Jonang master.

Magnus's answer is correct, but there is a bit more detail to add. 

The Vima Nyinthig is a commentary on the material belonging to the 17 tantras, being a portion of the 119 intimate instructions, most of which are presently lost. The Vima Nyinthik is commonly considered "Kama," although it in fact is a terma revealed by Zhangton Tashi Dorje in the early 12th century. 

The Khandro Nyinthig is considered part of Terma, revealed in the early 14th century, and is a commentary and practice cycle upon a tantra called the Longsal Barma Nyima Gyud, which organizes the material in the 17 tantras into a progressive path, which includes general preliminaries such as Vajrasattva, practices related to Anuyoga, as well as Dzogchen specific practices. 

The Lung for the 17 tantras (as well as the Vima and Khandro Nyinthigs) still exists and is still transmitted. The 17 tantras themselves and related material are also termas, though considered part of kama, revealed during the two decades prior to Atisha's death, somewhere in the early 1040's.

These teachings are the most important teachings of the Nyingma School.

It is called secret because the practices may not be disclosed to those who lack the ripening empowerments. This is why the seventh root downfall concerns not disclosing the secrets of the practice of Mantrayāna to those who are unripened.

If you are a teacher, then you can take responsibility. But these things are secret and should remain so. "Secret" means not sharing them with people who have no empowerment. 

The reason why Vajrayāna is decline is not sex scandals with gurus, it because people do not keep secret what is supposed to be secret. Vajra recitation is a completion stage practice. It is therefore secret.

If you want to share secret vajrayāna instructions with people you don't know over the internet, who state very clearly they have no empowerments, no guru,and thus no samaya and little understanding, and in the process break your own samaya, please do so by private message.

If the person who introduces you to the nature of mind the abuses people, then he or she abuses people. You can either continue to keep your blinders on or you can acknowledge the truth. It won't change your recognition one way or another. 

On the other hand, many people fool themselves into believing they have encountered the mind essence, and equally, there are unscrupulous teachers who have no  qualifications to evaluate such an encounter, who lie to their students in order to appeal to the latter's egos. 

Since you bring up the fact that this is a Vajrayāna forum, these points of view must also be considered. The reality, Dear Magnus, is that no one can introduce one to the mind essence. You must discover it on your own, a guru is merely a guide who helps you with the process of self-discovery, but the actual recognition is your job. 

Here there is no method and wisdom,
the appearance of true reality,
can’t be described by another, the connate
cannot be found anywhere,
but one can understand it in dependence on the Guru, 
time and method, and from one’s merit.

This more consistent with the mind series. The Man ngag sde series maintains that appearances are the rtsal or potential of vidyā (rig pa). This potential becomes the mind when it mixes with the karmavāyu from our breathing. This point is discussed in the Treasury of the Dharmadhātu.

Title: Re: rtsal, shared samsaric vision, “other” sentient beings

I directed you to look at the Tshig don mdzod, chapter three. He introduces the chapter saying, "Then, the explanation of how buddhagarbha permeates the sattvadhātu and the way it is exists. 

He begins by quoting the Mirror of the Essence of Vajrasattva above. He then cites the Fine Inlay ofJewels:

Just as oil has always been naturally present in
sesame or mustard seed,
within the deceptive appearance of the bodies of sentient beings
the seed of the tathāgatas
appears with matching light. 

The Sound Tantra states:

The pristine consciousness of one's vidyā abides in the body, 
like oil in sesame seed. 
The glow and brightness of the body
has always been permeated with the moistness of pristine consciousness.



And the Self-Arisen Vidyā:

The transcendent state of perfect buddhas
exists in the forms of kāyas and pristine consciousness
in the personal continuums of all sentient beings.


Having introduced these citations, he turns to sūtras and tantras of the common vehicles, citing long passages from the Nirvana Sūtra, Hevajra, the Dohas and so on, concluding that all of these citations together, including those from the man nga sde tantras above, demonstrate the existence of the sugatagarbha element in the continuums of sentient beings. He then goes on to criticize those who maintain that sugatagarbha is merely the emptiness of the mind itself, and so on. He then goes on to describe how the tathāgatagarbha doctrine is definitive, and so on.  Finally describing how sugatagarbha is present as five kāyas, five pristine consciousnesses, the five lights, the five families, the five vāyus of pristine consciousness, the five qualities of essence, nature, and compassion, the five afflictions, the five aggregates, the five elements, the five sense organs, the five desirable objects, and the five qualities of the three doors, citing the String of Pearls Tantra which explains all of this. 

For Longchenpa the pristine consciousness of vidyā is nothing other than tathāgatagarbha. And according to ChNN, there is no Tibetan whose writings on the Great Perfection are more definitive than Longchenpa's. So we can understand the above to be ChNN's own view as well.

People think Trungpa was an authentic master, given the sheer amount of accolade he is accorded by highly respected Tibetan masters such as Dzongsar Khyentse and so on. Since they think Trungpa is authentic, it is not hard to understand why they think Shambhala is authentic. Since they think Shambhala is authentic, they think the teachers in Shambhala are authentic. 

Trungpa is kind of the third rail in Tibetan Buddhism. Many people do not actually approve of him, but since he built a very successful organization, no one in the Tibetan hierarchy will directly criticize him. For this reason, people will continue to be attracted to Shambhala. They have turned Trungpa into a very successful brand.

Kongtrul's review of Dzogchen "cosmology" is rather incomplete in the Encyclopedia (he gives a more detailed and complete overview in other places). Also the term "ground of being" has no correlate in Tibetan. It is an erroneous translation of the simple term "gzhi," that is, basis. 

Also, the nature of the original basis is ka dag, original purity, i.e., emptiness free from extremes. There are severn presentations of the basis in Dzogchen, the only non-erroneous one is that the basis is originally pure. Original purity is a special term for emptiness which has never been contaminated by ignorance.

"Primordial state" is how ChNN translates the term "gzhi." "Gzhi" simply refer to something we have not realized. If there is some real primordial state, then how does it exist, in whom does it exist, and in what way does it exist, without falling into the four extremes. If it does not exist by way of any of the four extremes, for what reason then it is a fault to say there is no basis? Actually, the assertion that there is no basis is precisely the meaning of Dzogchen, Mahāmudra, and Prajñāpāramitā.

The notion comes from a line in the root text. The Hevajra tantra says, "Buddhist tīrthikas who do not know Hevajra will never attain buddhahood."

As I said, Vajrayāna hyperbole. For example, Khenpo Acho, student of Dudjom Rinpoche, attained rainbow body in the late nineties through the practice of Vajrakilāya. His other main practice was Naro Khachoma.

No, this is just standard Vajrayāna hyperbole. Even if you practice this, there is no guarantee of rainbow body.  Rainbow body depends on the practitioner, not the practice.

Yes, as well as having done the retreats, etc. Nevertheless, giving samaya to students requires having an iron belly for dealing with broken samaya, and a guru who has no realization will just be ruined if they are not careful.

My point is that these stories are exceeding rare, and perhaps not the best examples for beginning students of Tibetan Buddhism.

Better make sure you can stab your wooden kīla into a rock before you attempt such feats. Otherwise, you just harm yourself.

BTW, at Lamdre, recently, His Holiness Sakya Trizen 42 made it quite clear that the guru/disciple relationship was not one of total, slavish obedience. That if one's guru asked one to do things that contradicted the Dharma, one should disobey.

My point is that if you do not like the conversation, you are not required to participate. 

The Tibetan tradition is not perfect, it has problems, mostly having to do with abuse of power, money, sexism, and position, and exploiting the teachings to support worldly positions of power, to gain money, exploit women, and to preserve position. The ancient mahasiddhas had no interests in preserving power structures of Indian kings, Buddhist and otherwise, nor the worldly power of the monastic institutions, nor with maintaining patriarchal power over women. Instead, they abandoned all of this. It is for this reason I find it ironic that antinomian stories are being used to uphold the very institutions for which these ancient mahasiddhas had no use. Don't you find this odd?

In fact, I have a friend who is a close student of the late Chatral Rinpoche, who spent, over the years, many months at a time in close proximity to him. According to my friend, Chatral Rinpoche was never anything but unfailingly kind to students, and when westerners came to see him for teachings, he would kindly explain that unless they learned Tibetan, there was no point in him giving them teachings. This is not to say that there are no tales of Chatral Rinpoche expressing anger, for of course there are those stories as well. But my friends experience of him was one of nothing but complete kindness and care.

No, Nathan, I am pointing out that 1) Tsang Nyon Herukas 15th century bio of Milarepa is just a religious novel, with little basis in fact. 2) That this narrative of Tilo/Naro being held up as the model of guru/disciple relationship is not healthy nor sound, since Naropa was already a highly advanced Vajrayāna practitioner. 3) The fact that Naropa did not achieve buddhahood in his lifetime because he disobeyed Tilopa over the issue of debate is preserved in the early Sakya tradition, 12th century, so only a century after Naropa passed. Tsang Nyon's bio of Naropa is also unreliable as history. 4) Naropa's tradition of Vajrayogini is one of the most important Sakya teachings, so no disrespect to either master is intended. 5) I will never shut up. You should have figured that out by now.

1) Naropa was already an advanced Vajrayāna practitioner when he sought out Tilopa. 

2) Naropa did not realize buddhahood, because in the end, he disobeyed Tilopa over the issue of debating Hindus. 

3) Tilopa did not actually personally abuse Naropa. He put Naropa in situations where Naropa acted out his egotism and got into trouble as a result. 

4) These stories are comparatively rare. In fact, in the entire history of the Sakya tradition, filled with masters who attained the highest realizations, none of these stories exist. I cannot think of any similar stories in the Gelug, Jonang, or Nyingma traditions either. For some reason, however, the Kagyu tradition's take on guru devotion, using Tilopa/Naropa, Marpa/Mila narratives, is frankly unhealthy and leads students the wrong way. I also cannot think of any stories like this in the Kagyu tradition following Milarepa, in fact. So why do Tibetans and westerners constantly invoke the Tilopa/Naropa refrain? It makes no sense and merely promotes a sense that if you guru does not beat you, you are not making progress. Beyond this, there is the fact that Milarepa story is a complete fiction, as the research of Peter Alan Roberts clearly shows based on the earliest bios of Milarepa. 

For example, let us take the case of Virupa. Virupa was a monk, Shri Dharmapāla, abbot of Nalanda, who practiced Vajrayogini for twenty years. He thought he was not getting anywhere. So one night he decided to quit and tossed his māla in the toilet. He had a dream of Nairatma, and she told him that he had erred, and that he needed to retrieve his māla from the latrine and wash it. You see, he had received empowerments of Cakrasamvara, but his master had died before Dharmapāla could receive intimate instructions related to experiences on the path. So he misinterpreted his experiences of heat on the path of application, and further, he was practicing the wrong yidam. So the next day, he encountered nirmanakāya Nairatma and her band of yoginīs, received the Hevajra empowerment and instructions, and achieved one bodhisattva bhumi after another for six consecutive nights, realizing the sixth bhumi. Now, Virupa was definitely a crazy yogi, everywhere he went he challenged people's expectations, but he did it with kindness, not anger— though when he reversed the Ganges, he might have flooded a hut or two, and when he stopped the sun in the sky, he might have damaged some crops. In his dealings with Dombhi Heruka and Kanha, it is recorded he showed them nothing but kindness. It is well known that among the 84 mahāsiddhas, when it came to manifesting magical powers, Virupa was the greatest. Finally, people became a little too freaked out by Virupa's displays of power, so Avalokiteshvara intervened and asked Virupa to stop. Of course Virupa assented, having converted thousands of Hindus to Buddhadharma and the practice of Avalokiteshvara in particular, and when he passed, it is recorded that he dissolved his physical body into a statue of Avalokiteshvara in South India. The point of all of this is that there is more than one model of guru/disciple relationships.

Another of the root downfalls is causing people to lose faith in the Dharma. You are going to have to explain to me exactly how it is that promulgation of these few narratives does Vajrayāna more good than harm, considering they are exceptions and not the rule. 

And further, those of us who extol such stories as that of Tilo and Naro, think carefully, could you handle Tilopa as your guru? And if you answer honestly, you will admit there is no way you can handle this. And if you can't handle this, for what reason do you hold this up as an ideal model of a guru and student relationship?
