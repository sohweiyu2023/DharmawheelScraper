Alternately, Saicho may have been reacting against the newly imported Indian Mantrayāna sense of listing teachings in terms of their hierarchy (just as Chan reacted to Mantrayāna by inventing a lineage of patriarchs going back to the Buddha). While Kukai did not resort to the Nine Yanas scheme (yet to be elaborated by the Nyingmapas) both masters (Saicho and Kukai) were clearly aware of the four tenet system in India and the subsequent need to classify Chinese innovations in a progressive scheme, albeit differently and for different reasons. And naturally Kukai selected a nice round number for his progressive ladder of Buddhist and non-Buddhist teachings in China and Japan, with Confucism and Taoism at the bottomg of the rungs. 

Kukai's "mantrayāna as the conclusion of all dharma teachings" is one alternative; Saicho's attempting to contextualize all teachings in light of Tien Tai Lotus hermeneutics is another. Of these two, Kukai's approach is ultimately the more Indian Buddhist, and Saicho's more reflective of indegenous developments in Chinese Buddhism.

These are dge tshuls, śramaṇeras. They are rab byungs i.e. pravrajitas, ordained persons. They are therefore part of the ordained Sangha and can participate in posadha. Pravrajitas consist of all śramaṇeras and śramaṇerikas, bhikṣus and bhikṣunis. 

Thus the term "rab byung" refers to all ordained persons. The colloquial term is "Trapa" i.e. shaveling. 

A pravrajita is someone who has undertaken formal ordination beyond lay pratimoksha. But there is no such a thing as a Mahāyāna pravrajita at least not in any Indian Buddhist tradition with which I am familiar. The reason is that Indian Buddhists held that Mahāyāna vows were held to supplement or transform one's pratimoksha vows, but not that they substituted for them, as it seems some Chinese Buddhists and later Saicho held. 

The literature of vows became very important in India after the 8th century because with the proliferation of systems of ethics between various of the shravaka schools, then in the two strands of Mahāyāna vows and finally within the successive layers of tantra series, it all started to become contentious and confusing. Nevertheless, Mahāyāna and later Vajrayāna vows were considered to float on the platform of Hinayāna vows which were considered indispensible.

The Brahmajala sutra is clearly based on the Yogacara bodhisattva vow tradition which is more formal and more heavily predicated on pratimoksha than the Madhyamaka bodhisattva vow tradition. According to Bhikshu Dharmamitra, in Chinese Buddhism one was not really permitted to take the bodhisattva ordination without being grounded in pratimoksha vows first, which is how the Yogacahara system works. The Madhyamaka system does not require a preliminary ordination. Lay pratimoksha vows are taken along with bodhisattva vows. 

However, not drinking and remaining celibate does not make a one monk, nor does a shaved head. The only thing that makes a bhikṣu is receiving bhikṣu vows in a qualified way, as I am sure you agree. 

Since there are no Mahāyāna bhikṣu vows, receiving a Mahāyāna ordination cannot make one a monk, in my opinion. Of course, this is a thoroughly Indo-Tibetan attitude.

Well, no. I think that he did not understand the importance of pratimoksha and did not understand that the consequences of his understanding was to relegate so called monastics to the level of lay people inadvertantly. Because of Saicho, we now have Japanese priests claiming equal status with bhikṣus in Buddhist assemblies just because they shave their heads and wear religious  costumes.

These nadis (aka ba men rva) are simply poetic descriptions of the optical sheath which houses the optic nerve. In Tibetan Medicine, the terms "dar skud", silk thread, is a common alternate term for nerves (rtsa dkar po). The fact that so called "ka ti" is identified as possessing the nature of fire is merely a reflection of the fact that in Ayruveda and Tibetan Medicine the eye posseses the alocaka pitta (mthong byed mkhris pa) and so on. 

There is no need to posit a mysterious central asian origin. Their origin is found in the seventeen tantras. The understanding of the seventeen tantras is wedded with a Tibetan (and perhaps earlier Indian) understanding of human anatomy based on Dissection. Tibetans not only inheritied descriptions of dissections from Hellenic Medicine; unlike Indians and Chinese culture, they did not have the same taboo around cutting up bodies. The Tibetan doctors therefore had a better grasp of anatomy in general than Indian and Chinese doctors from an early period in the history of Tibetan Medicine.

When the Buddha was prepared for cremation he instructed Ananda to let the brahmins carry out the rites since they knew what they were doing. Obviouslhy the Buddha was quite happy in many instances to give brahmins credit for their valubale ritual expertise. And I am sure it continued that way for a thousand years. In fact, we know that it did because even today that are families of Thai brahmins connected with the Thai Court who have Vedic ritual reponsibilities to the Thai royal family.

Well, yes and no. Stupas comes from the Buddha, but they were adapted by the Buddha to fit a different context then their original context. 

It is rather stupid to ignore the fact that Buddhism borrowed and repurposed many elements of a shared Indian cultural heritage or to try and explain it away with some complicated religious reasoning. 

Sang offerings, Sur offerings and so on don't exist in Indian culture, so it would rather dull to refuse to acknowledge that many native Tibetan, as well as some Chinese rituals, were converted to Buddhist use under the general rubric of "tö" (gto) rites. There is a whole list of these things for example, in the Karling Shitro in the section on cheating death. Mipham has a book where he discloses many of these kinds of tö rites (in connection with elemental calculation) which formerly were closely guarded secrets because many of them indeed would be considered sorcery and given their worldly origin, were sorcerous at one time. Then there is the famous book of calculation called the Svarodaya tantra, a Shaivaite tantra preserved in the Tengyur, which is a work mainly concerned with military prediction, heavily used by the Fifth Dalai Lama, and extensively commented on by Mipham. 

We have to recognize, if we are really being honest, that Buddhism makes use of many "cultural rituals" that do not ultimately come from Buddhas, but are adapted by Buddhas and other awakened beings to suit the needs and proclivities of sentient beings. Thus the four activities were borrowed into Buddhism when tantric Buddhism began to spread in India in the 7th century. You can even find polemical arguments about why Buddhist fire pujas are "better" than Vedic fire pujas, when the Brahmins began to complain that Buddhists were horning in on their game.

Further, the body is in a box that has a 12 inch border in front of it (the Buddha statue is 18 inch size) -- that edge is not the edge of a cushion, but is the backpeice of the alter in front of it. Using the Buddha staues as a measure, you can see that the seated body is somewhere betwee 30 to 36 inches high. When I am seated, butt to crown, I am 39 inches.

He is mistaken. Cakras and Nadis appear in pre-Buddhist upanishads. The famed number 72,000 nadis occurs in the Brihadaryanika, look up Hita. The early mentions of vāyus, cakras and nadis are all to be found in the twopre- Buddhist Upanishads, and perhaps other early Puranic literature I have not seen. There is no reason in this instance to assume an extra-Indian origin for these theories. 

Candali Yoga is based again an Upanishadic verse from the Candoga which is frequently cited in Buddhist texts discussing the difference between Buddhist tantric practices and Hindu corrollaries. In actuality, Candali Yoga is based on the Indian concept of the burnt offering. 

Moreover, Indian doctors were certainly aware of arteries and veins, the difference between them and so on. If anything, the notion of channels and cakras comes from Ayurveda. 

Please near in mind I am not opposed to influences of this sort on genera principle -- for example, the Chinese certainly invented pulse diagnosis, which spread to Tibet and finally to India. The Greeks invered Urinalysis, which spread to Tibetan and India (via Unnani), and so on. Mercury preperation certainly originated in China, and only spread to India later, as David Gordon White shows, based on Needleman. But there is no valid reason to suppose that cakra and nadi theory is based on Taoism.

Even that were SVS's POV, I would not be inclined to accept it. 

As a practitioner, I accept the what the tradition says about itself understanding that there are spritiual reasons for the various accounts of the lineage. 

As a scholar, I accept only what can be ascertained as a certainty according to the common perception of human beings. So for example, if I find a number of obscure tantras embeded in a terma cycle that are also found in the NGB, as I have, I have to assume the terton is borrowing them into his collection. 

I don't have a problem with awakened humans borrowing old texts and repurposing them or reviving them.

The reason Nagarjuna only cites from the Agamas in the MMK is that his audience are non-Mahayanists i.e. the person in the text with whom he is engaging in a dialogue  is a non-Mahayanist (many people do not realize that MMK is written in the form of an philosophical dialogue with the opponent's position being set forth as well). 

His mangalam, however, is taken right from the PP sutras. Not only this, Nagarjuna came from the hearland of Mahayana, Andhra Pradesh. His praises are clearly Mahayana works. Then there is the Ratnavali, which is a Mahāyāna work for certain, and so on.

This is the form that worldly advice shows up in Tibetan texts, for example, this slice of advice from the explanatory tantra of Tibetan Medicine:

Keep one’s word. After giving one’s word, it is necessary to follow through. 
Even though one has promised to engage in negative actions, do the opposite. 
Begin positive actions even though delayed. 
Investigate in the beginning, then commit for future benefits. 
Do not accept advice as true; accept it after thorough investigation. 
Think about what is being said, then speak. 
Refrain from telling secrets. 
Do not listen to [petty] woman, and control one’s gossiping mouth. 
Speak freely to without deceit who view one with kindness without deceitful words. 
Be steady, and be happy with present company. 
Do not permit enemies to be free, tame them with skill. 
Support one’s relatives and employees, look for a long while at [those who have been] kind in the past. 
Respect one’s elders, i.e. one’s teacher, father, uncle and so on. 
One mind should be in accord with one’s countrymen, friends, and constant companions. 
In business be strict; when necessary, behave liberally. 
Accept defeat if mistaken; be measured if victorious. 
If one is an expert, diminish one’s arrogance, if one is wealthy, understand it is sufficient. 
Do not scorn inferiors, do not be jealous of superiors. 
Do not depend on evil men, do not make enemies of sorcerers or priests. 
Do not use the wealth of others, and avoid [causes for] retribution and taking oaths. 
Plant one’s feet to have no regrets. 
Do not give power to evil persons. 
One’s mind should be honest, improve the basis of patience and openness. 
It is important to accomplish most activities in a timely fashion.

Bhavabhata and Bhavyakirit both hold that "This teacher (i.e. Śakyamuni) having attained buddhahood in the beginningless past taught the Cakrasamvara tantras, but later, after becoming the son of Śuddodana, did not teach it. Their reasoning holds that since Cakrasamvara is continually practiced by the heros and yoginis of the twenty four countries, even when eon forms and perished (the twenty four countries) do not form and perish so [the Cakrasamvara] does not disappear. Even though other dharmas may have also been taught in the beginning, since they are destroyed by the formation and perishing of the eon, since they disappear during the interval, they must be taught again by Śākyamuni.

A special feature of Cakrasamvara is that unlike Guhyasamaja, Kalacakra, Hevajra, etc., the mandala of Cakrasamvara is never withdrawn it is not necessary for Śākyamuni to teach it again as it would redundant.

In terms of the path, there is no difference at all between the Yogacara presentation and the Madhyamaka presentation, so this is a kind of redundant thing to say. 

The controversy is over whether there is a difference in view between Yogacara and Madhyamaka. 

gzhan stong pas are Tibetan partisans of Yogacara who assert a)there is a diference between Cittamatra and Yogacara, and b1) Yogacara is either higher than Madhyamaka b2) or is a form of Madhyamaka with a difference in emphasis. 

Basically, there are three alternatives: 

Madhyamaka is higher than Yogacara
Madhyamaka and Yogacara have the same meaning with different emphasis
Madhyamaka is inferior to Yogacara.

How could freedom from extremes be intrinsically or extrinsically empty, based on the Nāgārjuna citation I provided above?

Here is another one:

Since arising, abiding, and perishing are not established, the conditioned is not established. 
Since the condition is never established, how will the unconditioned be established?

Basically the rang stong/gzhan stong controversy is bullshit, and so is the prasangika/svatantrika controversy. 

If you want to understand Madhyamaka, don't read Tibetan accounts of Madhyamaka dating after the 13th century. And here, it is better still just to rely on Indian masters. The sole exception to this is Khenpa Shenga's treatises, which are just Indian commentaries turned into footnoted annotations of root texts.

I mean that there is no rang stong at all from a Madhyamaka perspective: Nāgārjuna states:

If there were something subtle not empty, there would be something subtle to be empty, 
as there is nothing not empty, where is there something to be empty?

I mean that there is no rang stong at all, apart from what the gzhan stong pas have fabricated. 

The gzhan stong controversy arose out of a need by Tibetans to reconcile the five treatises of Maitreya with Nāgārjuna's Collection of Reasoning based upon the erroneous historical idea that the five treatises were authored by the bodhisattva Maitreya rather than a human being (who incidentally was probably Asanga's teacher). 

In my opinion, the five treatises were a collection of texts meant to explicate the three main thrusts of Indian Mahāyāna sutras, Prajñāpāramita, Tathāgatagarbha, and Yogacāra. Four of the five are devoted to these three topics independently, with the Abhisamaya-alaṃkara devoted to Prajñāpāramita; Uttaratantra devoted to Tathāgatagarbha; and the two Vibhangas devoted to Yogacāra . The last, the Sutra-alaṃkara is an attempt to unify the thought of these three main trends in Mahāyāna into a single whole, from a Yogacara perspective. 

When these treatises arrived in Tibetan, at the same time, a text attributed tothe original Bhavaviveka, but probably by a later Bhavaviveka, translated under Atisha's encouragement, called Tarkajvala, presented the broad outline of what we know call today " the four tenet systems". 

In this text, the three own natures and so on were presented in a very specific way from a Madhyamaka perspective and labelled "cittamatra".

So, the gzhan stong controversy (with additional input from Vajrayāna exegesis based on a certain way of understand the three bodhisattva commentaries) is about reconciling Madhyamaka with Yogacara. 

Personally, I see no need to attempt to reconcile Madhyamaka and Yogacara. Madhyamaka is the pinnacle of sutra explication. But Tibetans did and still seem to need to do so, and they have passed on this need to their students. 

But from my perspective, one cannot go beyond freedom from extremes.

Since rang stong is just a strawman set up by gzhan stong pas, there is really no debate between gzhan stong and rang stong since there is no rang stong Madhyamaka except in the imagination of those who call themselves "gzhan stong" Madhyamakas.

And often enough translators decide to translate dbyer med as non-dual, even though dbyer med is asaṁbhedaḥ, inseparable. 

I am just a bigger pain in the ass than most translators and more insisitent that translations reflect and are completely consistent with buddhist view so that crypto-hindu notions stay out of our school.

"Non-dual" i.e. gnyis med/advaya means the absence of the duality of being and non-being. 

In Yogacara, it can mean absence of subject and object, but the reason for this is that ultimately there is an absence of being and non-being. 

Even when we talk about the inseparability of original purity and natural formation, kadag and lhundrup, this inseparability is actually predicated on the non-duality that I mentioned above. When we talk about freedom from the four extremes, the eight extremes and so on, it is all, in the end predicated on the absence of being and non-being. That absence of being and non-being is the essence of what the term "non-dual" means in Buddhist texts. 

It is not a translation or terminology issue, it is just a basic fact of Buddhist view.

The great 11th Nyingma scholar Rongzom points out that only Madhyamaka accepts that its critical methodology "harms itself", meaning that Madhyamaka uses non-affirming negations to reject the positions of opponents, but does not resort to affirming negations to support a position of its own. Since Madhyamaka, as Buddhapalita states "does not propose the non-existence of existents, but instead rejects claims for the existence of existents", there is no true Madhyamaka position since there is no existent found about which a Madhyamaka position could be formulated; likewise there is no false Madhyamaka position since there is no existent found about which a Madhyamaka position could be rejected.

The basic problem with the four thoughts is that they are presented in very meideval language and people become expert in artificial contemplations that do not reach their heart. 

You are going to die, sooner rather than later. 
Your friends and family are leaving you right now, not at some later time. 
Right now you could be practicing dharma, but you are wasting your time with worldly foolishness [jobs, families, car payments]
There is no happiness, anywhere. Don't delude yourself that there is. 
All your present happiness and suffering is a result of karma. If you do not want to suffer in future, practice Dharma. 

We all know the above are true, and we all make tons of excuses for not doing anything about it. 

If you are not in tears from practicing the above, your contemplation is not working into your heart.

"Non-dual" in Dzogchen in Dzogchen is no different than non-dual in Madhyamaka - it means that the categories of being and non-being are cognitive errors. 

Also in Dzogchen practice one does not seek to avoid discursive thoughts. One seeks to recognize their actual state.

By knowledge, we mean that you know what is being discussed. No need to gum up the works with fancy words like gnosis. In the beginning you need to acquire intellectual data. Then you need to apply it. This is all part of "rigpa". 

If you say that rigpa is only a "gnosis" than this makes things more complicated --it means in order to have that knowledge you must already be awakened. But this is not the case. Rigpa is the knowledge you have that allows you to wake up.  Rigpa is a complicated word in Dzogchen texts, and has different meanings in different contexts, but generally it just means knowledge, which in English is the antonym of ignorance (ma rig pa). Conceptual knowledge is inlcuded under the general definition of vidyā, this is a poorly understood point.

Shilajt, according to Tibetan Medicine, is cooling and balancing, and is used to remove heat. It can be used as a chulen, and it is present in many medicines since it enhances their effects. It is especially good for removing heat in liver and gall bladder. 

It is true that some in Ayurveda considers it to be warming, etc. However, in the treatise Astangha Hridaya it asserts that the taste of shilajit is bitter, and that it's effect is "not very hot", but its post-digestive effect is hot. 

So there there some slight differences in how this herb is understood, but in the main, the two systems are not really far apart in how the prepare and use this substance.

Rigpa is something that one slowly develops over time, until one has complete confidence in the meaning of the teachings. 

The term rigpa is used in different ways in Dzogchen teachings, so one has to be very specific. It does not have univerally applied meaning like "consciousness" for example. This is because Rig is both a noun and a verb in Tibetan, depending on the word ending.

Sakya Pandita addresses this question extensively in his reply to Nyemo Gomchen:


There are two kinds of Buddhist panditas and Buddhist kusalis i.e. the panditas and kusalis of the perfection vehicle will become Buddhas, but it takes a long time, three incalculable eons and so on. The pair of panditas and kusalis of the secret mantra vehicle quickly attain Buddhahood because of the arrangement of inner interconnections.  In addition, a so called “pandita” is described as “A scholar in the foundation of outer and inner objects of knowledge.” A so called “kusali” is described as “One who inwardly has the most dedication inwardly after severing all outer distractions.”

In terms of actual perfect Buddhahood: first, having become knowledgeable about all objects of knowledge the pandita has severed doubt through hearing, reflection and meditation. Then, because of severing doubt through meditating which makes samadhi essential, gradually attains Buddhahood after actualizing the Dharma of realization is a pandita. A kusali necessarily has the same basis, but when considered alone, a pandita is closer to Buddhahood.

Now then, if it is wondered whether there is a conflict with the statement in The Ratnakuta sūtra:

Compared with someone who listens for ten eons
and then gives explanations to others,
when someone who meditates for just a moment,
the merit of the latter is greater than the former. 

The intent of that: the intention is that mediation is when a scholar understands the meaning of the object of meditation, but without understanding what sort of beneficial qualities can there be? Also Vinaya states:

Don’t meditate in mountain retreats without being a master of the canon.

The Abhidharmakośa states:

Possessing basis of discipline, hearing and reflection,
is best applied in meditation.

And as the Āryācharya Nāgārjuna states:

Without relying on convention,
the ultimate will not be realized,
without realizing the ultimate,
nirvana will not be attained. 

Therefore, since it is said many times “…liberation is attained in this life by listening the categories from all the sutras”, it is said that “…if one is not liberated by hearing, later on one should meditate.”

What you are talking about is called "clarity". The mind can take it's own awareness as an object.Indeed, in all Mahamudra and Dzogchen meditation, this is precisely what is taken as the object. You may not be able to "get rid" of this clarity, but you will never find it or be able to say "This is it, this is not it". This clarity is also dependently originated since the mind is dependently originated. There is no awareness or clarity seperate from the mind. The characteristic of the mind is clarity. The essence of the mind is emptiness. These two are non-dual, and that is the nature of the mind i.e. inseperable clarity and emptiness.

Hi Greg:

dharmadhātu is chos dbyings or chos kyi dbyings. 

In tibetan, dbyings can mean "space". But dhātu can never mean space. Dhātu, in Sanskrit, means "a mine" or "a source". 

Some western translators naively translate "dbyings" as space because dbyings can have that connotation in Tibetan. 

But chos kyi dbyings is never defined in Tibetan by Tibetan masters as the "space of phenomena". 

It is often defined as a chos kyi 'byung gnas i.e. a source of phenomena however. One notable example of someone who gives "a source of phenomena" for dharmadhātu would be Longchenpa in the chos dyings mdzod.

Canto Twenty-Four 

Amazing!
Now then, sole fortunate dear children,
listen to this vajra song with joy and enthusiasm!
If realized in that way, the whole of existence
is the ultimate mandala of a book of advice
in which baseless, forever liberated non-grasping words
are written on the pages of various white and red appearances 
with the pen of vidyā’s self-originated primordial wisdom.

Having read the book in the state of non-dual appearance and emptiness,
the naturally formed maṇḍala of the billion world cosmos 
is wetted with the water of a natural downpour of heavy rain,
the lane is marked with the natural great lines,
and one’s footprints are images of colored sand.
One’s body is the form of the yidam deity of appearance and emptiness,
the empty sounds of speech is vajra recitation
and the self-liberated mind of the deity does not grasp memories or thoughts.
All motions of the limbs are mudras.
All food and drink is an offering of dharmatā.
All apparent forms are the form of the deity.
All loud noises and speech are music.
Naturally occurring samaya is not protected and cannot be harmed.
No matter what such yogins do,
since their instructions and creation stage along with 
commitments are perfect in the state of luminous dharmatā, [145]
there is no need to depend on dharmas of effort. 
Effortless siddhi is very amazing.
Rapid attainment is a special feature
of the great perfection, fortunate heart children.

As such, if one practices with confidence,
just like clouds disappear into space,
the mass of concepts of samsara and nirvana will be purified in the original ground.
Just like the disc of the sun is clear without any obscuration,
after one’s vidyā manifests the luminous dharmakāya,
one will be able to revive the dead and be able to understand what is hidden.
Having demonstrated various miraculous abilities,
one will tame migrating beings.
Having totally perfected all the qualities of the stages and paths,
the persons of the best capacity are liberated in this lifetime
and the medium are liberated in the bardo at the moment of death.
Having been liberated in the originally pure basis, after permanently dwelling
as the three kāyas and primordial wisdoms (that are never joined with one another or separated) in the dharmadhātu,
also send forth emanations to tame whoever is to be tamed,
performing the benefit of migrating beings without interruption. 

Bearing these words and topics in mind,
it is certain the sun of happiness will arise from inside. 
That one who sings a song of such realization,
appears to be the renunciate, Tsogdrug Rangdrol.
By this merit, may all the stains of the conceptual affliction
of ignorance of many fortunate disciples
be quickly purified into the originally pure original dharmadhātu
and the result be attained in this life.

"Many Native American tribes did practice some form of slavery before the European introduction of African slavery into North America; but none exploited slave labor on a large scale.[1]
Native American groups frequently enslaved war captives whom they primarily used for small-scale labor.[1] Some, however, were used in ritual sacrifice.[1] Although not much is known about them, there is little evidence that these slaves were considered racially inferior to the Native Americans who held power over them.[1] Nor did Native Americans buy and sell captives in the pre-colonial era, although they sometimes exchanged enslaved individuals with other tribes in peace gestures or in exchange for their own members.[1] In fact, the word "slave" may not even accurately apply to these captive people.[1] Most of these so-called Native American slaves tended to live on the fringes of Native American society and were slowly integrated into the tribe.[1]
Until European settlers arrived, these slaves were other tribesmen.[1] The situation of these enslaved Native Americans varied among the tribes. In many cases, enslaved captives were adopted into the new tribes to replace warriors killed during a raid.[1] Enslaved warriors sometimes endured mutilation or torture that could end in death as part of a grief ritual for relatives slain in battle.[1] Some Native Americans would cut off one foot of their captives to keep them from running away. Others allowed enslaved captives to marry the widows of slain husbands.[1] The Creek, who engaged in this practice, treated children born of slaves and tribal members as full members of the tribe rather than as enslaved offspring.[1] Several tribes held captives as hostages for payment.[1] Various tribes also practiced debt slavery or imposed slavery on tribal members who had committed crimes; full tribal status would be restored as the enslaved worked off their obligations to the tribal society.[1] Other such slave-owning tribes of North America included Comanche of Texas, Creek of Georgia, the fishing societies, such as the Yurok, that lived along the coast from what is now Alaska to California, the Pawnee, and Klamath.[2]
When the Europeans “discovered” the Native Americans they began to participate in the slave trade.[3] Native Americans, in their initial encounters with the Europeans, attempted to use their captives from other tribes as a “method of playing one tribe against another” in an unsuccessful game of divide and conquer.[3]
The Haida and Tlingit who lived along southeast Alaska's coast were traditionally known as fierce warriors and slave-traders, raiding as far as California.[4][5] In their society, slavery was hereditary after slaves were taken as prisoners of war.[4][5] Among some Pacific Northwest tribes, as many as one-fourth of the population were slaves.[4][5]"

"Greek tyranny in the main grew out of the struggle of the popular classes against the aristocracy or against priest-kings where archaic traditions and mythology sanctioned hereditary and/or traditional rights to rule. Popular coups generally installed tyrants, who often became or remained popular rulers, at least in the early part of their reigns. For instance, the popular imagination remembered Peisistratus for an episode - related by (pseudonymous) Aristotle, but possibly fictional - in which he exempted a farmer from taxation because of the particular barrenness of his plot."

More or less an archaic version of dictatorship of the prols.

Read Peter Allen Roberts' book on the bios of Rechungpa. 

The standard bio of Milarepa by Tsang Nyon Heruka, is quite late and stands a number of facts on their head when it is compared to bios composed by Gampopa, and so on (for example, Milarepa's mother is never mentioned, his father was alive, there was no evil Aunt and Uncle, etc. ). 

Basically, Roberts tracks all of the hagiographies of Mila in an effort to find out why Mila's main student, Rechungpa, and only complete lineage holder, was turned into an example of the "bad student" par excellence by generations of Kagyu monastics.

It is easy to get the scent of Dzogchen. But in reality, understanding Dzogchen is much harder. The biggest obstacle to understanding Dzogchen is thinking that we understand it. I do not mean it is impossible to understand Dzogchen, of course it is possible, but that understanding can really only be predicated on personal experience, and it is the extremely rare person who can understand Dzogchen based on a few teaching and a couple of months of practice. Most of us need to spend ten or twenty years.

Because even though Dzogchen is simple, it is extremely subtle. 

For example, you have to let go of letting go. You have to stop fabricating your non-fabrication. 

You have stop affecting your non-affectation. 

I know many, many so called Dzogchen practitioners in DC and elsewhere, both teachers and students. All of them are still, to some degree or another, under the influence of their emotions, their physical bodies, their karma and their circumstances. 

So the problem is not with the teachings, the teachings are perfect. The problem is with the practitioners. And the problem is in general that Dzogchen is far more subtle than students understand. The teachers know this, which is why they continue to encourage people not to think that Dzogchen is something so easy. Even a teaching like dependent origination is very subtle. How much more so is Dzogchen, which is where the teaching of dependent origination leads one in the end. 

So, Dzogchen words are simple, but their meaning is extremely subtle, and the practice of Dzogchen is not so easy. If you tell people otherwise, you are acting like a Mara.

The doctrine of Karma in Buddhism is an aesthetic moral theory. Moral actions garner pleasant results, immoral actions garner unpleasant results. Therefore, all happiness and all suffering is result of one's own moral or immoral acts in this or in past lives. 

If you can't accept that, than Buddhism will be a constant source of frustration for you and you will waste a lot of intellectual energy trying to get Buddhism to fit your needs. In the end, you will give up Buddhism. So, it is better perhaps not even to start. One does not need to be a Buddhist to meditate, or be a nice person,or even a profoundly spiritual, compassionate person etc. 

If you wish to be free of suffering and its causes, however, then Buddhism is your only solution.

Musk and musk deer leather, tusks, and so on, and so on are also very antiseptic and used for dispelling negative spirits. It is one of the main medicines used to repel spirit provocations too. Musk deer tusks at one time were used as needles for blood-letting since they will not cause infections. 

For sang offerings, it is not necessary to use an incense. One can use herbs, sage, juniper, etc. 

There are some incenses made for use in lower tantra that do not have musk. People who follow the system of lower tantra should use these.

Nope, absolutely not -- they are referring gla rtsi, which comes from the so-called "musk deer", Moschus moschiferus.

The musk deer belongs to the family Moschidae and lives in India, Pakistan, Tibet, China, Siberia and Mongolia. To obtain the musk, the deer is killed and its gland, also called "musk pod", is removed. Upon drying, the reddish-brown paste inside the musk pod turns into a black granular material called "musk grain", which is then tinctured with alcohol. The aroma of the tincture gives a pleasant odor only after it is considerably diluted. No other natural substance has such a complex aroma associated with so many contradictory descriptions; however, it is usually described abstractly as animalic, earthy and woody[3] or something akin to the odor of baby's skin.

Vegans and vegetarians should never, ever, use Tibetan Incense, because all good quality Tibetan incense has quite a bit of real musk in it. 

Musk is also a very important substance in Tibetan and Ayurvedic medicine.

Sang is usually offered in the morning. But can be offered at other times as well.

Juniper however is used because of its antiseptic properties and sang does mean "to cleanse".

That however is not how it works in Buddhism. This sutta is instructive:

At Savatthi. Then, early in the morning, Cala the nun put on her robes and, taking her bowl &amp; outer robe, went into Savatthi for alms. When she had gone for alms in Savatthi and had returned from her alms round, after her meal she went to the Grove of the Blind to spend the day. Having gone deep into the Grove of the Blind, she sat down at the foot of a tree for the day's abiding.

Then Mara the Evil One, wanting to arouse fear, horripilation, &amp; terror in her, wanting to make her fall away from concentration, approached her &amp; said, "What is it that you don't approve of, nun?"

"I don't approve of birth, my friend."


[Mara:]
Why don't you approve of birth?
	One who is born
	enjoys sensual pleasures.
Who on earth
ever persuaded you:
	'Nun, don't approve of birth'?

[Sister Cala:]
For one who is born
		there's death.
One who is born
		sees pain.
It's a binding, a flogging, a torment.
That's why one shouldn't approve
		of birth.

The Awakened One taught me the Dhamma
	— the overcoming of birth —
	for the abandoning of all pain,
		he established me in
		the truth.
But beings who have come to form
&amp; those with a share in the formless,
	if they don't discern cessation,
	return to becoming-again.
Then Mara the Evil One — sad &amp; dejected at realizing, "Cala the nun knows me" — vanished right there.

http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka ... .than.html" onclick="window.open(this.href);return false;

As is this one:

I have heard that on one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jeta's Grove, Anathapindika's monastery. Then Subha the student, Todeyya's son, went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, exchanged courteous greetings with him. After an exchange of friendly greetings &amp; courtesies, he sat to one side. As he was sitting there, he said to the Blessed One: "Master Gotama, what is the reason, what is the cause, why baseness &amp; excellence are seen among human beings, among the human race? For short-lived &amp; long-lived people are to be seen, sickly &amp; healthy, ugly &amp; beautiful, uninfluential &amp; influential, poor &amp; rich, low-born &amp; high-born, stupid &amp; discerning people are to be seen. So what is the reason, what is the cause, why baseness &amp; excellence are seen among human beings, among the human race?"

"Students, beings are owners of kamma, heir to kamma, born of kamma, related through kamma, and have kamma as their arbitrator. Kamma is what creates distinctions among beings in terms of coarseness &amp; refinement."

"I don't understand the detailed meaning of Master Gotama's statement spoken in brief without explaining the detailed meaning. It would be good if Master Gotama taught me the Dhamma so that I might understand the detailed meaning of his brief statement."

"In that case, student, listen &amp; pay close attention. I will speak."

"As you say, Master Gotama," Subha the student responded.

The Blessed One said: "There is the case, student, where a woman or man is a killer of living beings, brutal, bloody-handed, given to killing &amp; slaying, showing no mercy to living beings. Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, hell. If, on the break-up of the body, after death — instead of reappearing in the plane of deprivation, the bad destination, the lower realms, hell — he/she comes to the human state, then he/she is short-lived wherever reborn. This is the way leading to a short life: to be a killer of living beings, brutal, bloody-handed, given to killing &amp; slaying, showing no mercy to living beings.

"But then there is the case where a woman or man, having abandoned the killing of living beings, abstains from killing living beings, and dwells with the rod laid down, the knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, &amp; sympathetic for the welfare of all living beings. Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in a good destination, in the heavenly world. If, on the break-up of the body, after death — instead of reappearing in a good destination, in the heavenly world — he/she comes to the human state, then he/she is long-lived wherever reborn. This is the way leading to a long life: to have abandoned the killing of living beings, to abstain from killing living beings, to dwell with one's rod laid down, one's knife laid down, scrupulous, merciful, &amp; sympathetic for the welfare of all living beings.

"There is the case where a woman or man is one who harms beings with his/her fists, with clods, with sticks, or with knives. Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in the plane of deprivation... If instead he/she comes to the human state, then he/she is sickly wherever reborn. This is the way leading to sickliness: to be one who harms beings with one's fists, with clods, with sticks, or with knives.

"But then there is the case where a woman or man is not one who harms beings with his/her fists, with clods, with sticks, or with knives. Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in a good destination... If instead he/she comes to the human state, then he/she is healthy wherever reborn. This is the way leading to health: not to be one who harms beings with one's fists, with clods, with sticks, or with knives.

"There is the case, where a woman or man is ill-tempered &amp; easily upset; even when lightly criticized, he/she grows offended, provoked, malicious, &amp; resentful; shows annoyance, aversion, &amp; bitterness. Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in the plane of deprivation... If instead he/she comes to the human state, then he/she is ugly wherever reborn. This is the way leading to ugliness: to be ill-tempered &amp; easily upset; even when lightly criticized, to grow offended, provoked, malicious, &amp; resentful; to show annoyance, aversion, &amp; bitterness.

"But then there is the case where a woman or man is not ill-tempered or easily upset; even when heavily criticized, he/she doesn't grow offended, provoked, malicious, or resentful; doesn't show annoyance, aversion, or bitterness. Through having adopted &amp; carried out such actions, on the break-up of the body, after death, he/she reappears in a good destination...

This is the way leading to beauty: not to be ill-tempered or easily upset; even when heavily criticized, not to be offended, provoked, malicious, or resentful; nor to show annoyance, aversion, &amp; bitterness.

It seems the organizers made this one of the least non-sectarian Kalacakras in many years, at least this was the impression conveyed to me by a Tibetan monastic in attendance at the event. 

Other masters who have traditionally assisted HHDL with Kalacakra were not invited to attend this year, for example, HHST.

The serial moments of a mind stream carries past impressions. Under the power of samadhi these impressions will unlock one's pastlife experiences. 

If one develops sufficient powers of samadhi, one can also examine other people's minds and see into their past lives as well.

In order to become a fully awakened Buddha one must eradicated the three poisons caused by ignorance which result in rebirth in samsara.

There are two obscurations, the afflictive obscuration caused by the three poisons, and the knowledge obscuration. To attain the result that is the desiderate of Theravada, one must only remove the first. From a Mahāyāna perspective, one must remove both completely in order to become a Buddha. 

But in both cases, it is necessary to cease having rebirth in samsara.

That's fine but that is not the point. 

The point is that Buddha not only taught rebirth, but he defined the four types of awakened people [stream entrants, once returners, never returners and arhats] by how many rebirths they had remaining before they would achieve nirvana. 

It is true that he did not equate worldly happiness with belief in rebirth, since there were plenty of people in India during his day who also did not believe in rebirth. That is why he taught the brahmaviharas to lay people. The practice of them guarantees mental happiness whether one should accept rebirth or not. 

But that is not Buddhism. Buddhism is predicated on the goal of ending rebirth in samsara through the eradication of the three poisons, desire, hatred and confusion, which arise because of ignorance.

Ego simply means 'I' in Greek and Latin. However, we use it in English as a term derived from Freudian analysis (primarily). In this respect, this use of the term does not exist in Buddhism. In Buddhism, (as you note) there is no concept like the Western psychoanalytical personality per se -- only a sense of a mundane person or a transcending person, a virtuous person or a non-virtous person, driven by positive, negative or afflicted mental factors. There is no idea of a balanced personality, per se, apart from a person in good health whose dhātus (vatta, pitta, kapha) are well balanced.

However, all people are egoistic, since we all have our self-interest at heart, and atma-graha and bdag 'dzin can easily be translated as "egoism". Egotism, is mostly what Buddhist texts means by "pride".

One if its main uses is for disorders of the prana vāyu which often results in cycling depression. 

Vimala (Nutmeg 25) on the other hand is a medicine also used for vātta disorders, but mainly for sleep disorders. Vimala was originally created by Vimalamitra to combat provocations by Gyalpos. 

If you have trouble with rlung/vatta, one of the best treatments you can have is massage, especially ayurvedic massage with the proper oil. Also your diet should have a moderate amount of lamb, you should regularly take small quantity of ghee, avoid all caffeine, etc. Follow a diet and behavior for vatta person.

Because the experience of non-conceptuality more closely resembles the experience of emptiness. In other words, in sutra there are no methods for approximating the experience of realizing emptiness. In tantra there are many. 

Plus, you have to understand, that this experience is what is introduced during empowerment, and further, since the channels have been purified, the movements of winds are more subtle; and hence the mind is more subtle; hence the emptiness realization is more profound and more rapid. 

We are not asserting that the ordinary bliss of an average couple's intercourse could ever lead to the realization of emptiness more rapidly than dhyana. However, when connected with the method, it does. 

This does not contradict Nāgārjunas intent, since the experience of non-conceptuality is relative, and that relative experience is being used to point towards the ultimate.

Content:
"The hallmark of the intelligent design movement, however, is that it purports to rise above the level of personal skepticism. It claims to have found a reason why evolution could not have produced a structure like the bacterial flagellum, a reason based on sound, solid scientific evidence.

Why does the intelligent design movement regard the flagellum as unevolvable? Because it is said to possesses a quality known as "irreducible complexity." Irreducibly complex structures, we are told, could not have been produced by evolution, or, for that matter, by any natural process. They do exist, however, and therefore they must have been produced by something. That something could only be an outside intelligent agency operating beyond the laws of nature – an intelligent designer. That, simply stated, is the core of the new argument from design, and the intellectual basis of the intelligent design movement.

The great irony of the flagellum's increasing acceptance as an icon of anti-evolution is that fact that research had demolished its status as an example of irreducible complexity almost at the very moment it was first proclaimed. The purpose of this article is to explore the arguments by which the flagellum's notoriety has been achieved, and to review the research developments that have now undermined they very foundations of those arguments.

...

This, however, is not what is meant by "intelligent design" in the parlance of the new anti-evolutionists. Their views demand not a universe in which the beauty and harmony of natural law has brought a world of vibrant and fruitful life into existence, but rather a universe in which the emergence and evolution of life is made expressly impossible by the very same rules. Their view requires that the source of each and every novelty of life was the direct and active involvement of an outside designer whose work violated the very laws of nature he had fashioned. The world of intelligent design is not the bright and innovative world of life that we have come to know through science. Rather, it is a brittle and unchanging landscape, frozen in form and unable to adapt except at the whims of its designer.

...

Against such a backdrop, the struggles of the intelligent design movement are best understood as clamorous and disappointing double failures – rejected by science because they do not fit the facts, and having failed religion because they think too little of God."

Yes, it would seem Will's crusade for this book has more to do with his own prejudice and bias against what he perceives to be "scientific" materialism than anything else. 

He seems unable to accept that despite Meyer's protests, all of Meyer's arguments are in favor of a supernatural intelligent agent.

Sakya view -- butter comes from churning milk
Shentong view -- butter is fully formed in milk already.

In other words, the Sakya POV is that the qualities of butter must exist in milk from the beginning, otherwise, one could never get butter out of milk. Likewise, the qualities of buddhahood must exist in sentient beings from the beginning, otherwise, sentient beings could never be the cause of buddhas.

They may be inseperable, but they do not necessarily all appear together at the same time. In any event, there is no fault in asserting that sambhogakāya arises from the dharmakāya -- there is a saying in Dzogchen -- at the time of the basis, all kāyas are the dharmakāya; at the time of the result, all kāyas are the nirmanakāya. 

The three kāyas always exist on the basis of a sentient being's mind. If not, then the inseparability of samsara and nirvana would not be possible, and there would be no way for the three kāyas to manifest.

Well, most of the physical universe will be destroyed. There will remain a few "god" realms where sentient beings hang around until the container universe reforms. 

The 1002 buddhas are discussed in a specific mahayana sutra attributed to Shakyamuni. But this does not mean that all of reality is predetermined. 

It just means that according to this sutra Buddha made a prediction about the 998 buddhas to follow him. The next one, Maitreya, is expected to appear when the life span of human beings again increases to the span of 8,000 years (after it decreases to an average of ten years, etc.).

These kinds of cosmic epicycles are very characteristics of Indian religious thinking in general, and not particular to Buddhism.

The process of the liberation of Samantabhadra is proper to man ngag sde. You will not find anything about it in sems sde, at all, not even a little bit. You can read about it in the eleven topics of Dzogchen Nyinthig. 

The innate ignorance is not a "stain" per say. It is not an afflictive ignorance, it is a simple absence of knowing. 

Basically, at the point the basis arises from the basis, there is a neutral awareness present in the basis. That neutral awareness has no self-knowledge until the basis arises. While it is not aware of itself, it is in a state of non-afflictive ignorance. 

When it apprehends the five lights, it apprehends them either as its own display, resulting in nirvana, Samantabhadra, etc., or it does not, resulting in samsara. The Tantra That Uproots Delusion:

Knowing the energy of the svābhavakāya
as their own appearance produced buddhas;
being mistaken about their own appearance produced sentient beings.

Afflictive ignorance comes from the dualistic vision produced by imputing ignorance.

In order to understand this, you need to study the process of Samantabhadra's liberation. When you do so, you will discover than Samantabhadra was not always liberated.

Sure it does. The outer elements gradually come together again after the universe cools off, forms solar systems, planets that are capable of bearing life and then life forms evolve on the planets. 

It does not require design. 

Buddhism does not describe outer dependent origination in detail. But as long as one's version of the universe's formation does not included a creator or a first cause of any kind, then that version will be acceptable to Buddhism.

There are no first beings. 

Please read the third chapter of the Kosha where the collapse and formation of the universes is described. 

Basically, what happens is that at the end of the last eon, all sentient beings are reborn in the upper two form realms while the rest of the container universe is destroyed. There is a period of twenty dark eons, and then due to the traces of action the wind mandala forms again, and and after the container universe forms due to the traces of karma of sentient beings, a being is born from the upper two form realms into the brahma loka. He looks around, and being unable to remember the loka from which he took rebirth, and being unable to perceive it, thinks he is both self-created, created the whole shebang, and manages to convince everyone else who is reborn afterwards that he did create it all. 

The point, Will, is that dependent origination does not permit there ever to be a first anything. 

Adibuddha simply refers to the first Buddha of a given eon i.e. the Sambhogakāya. It does not mean some creator buddha, as you know.

I am betting Will might be a freemason, though, and while masonry is supposedly open to all of any faith (upon invitation, of course), one of the principle requirements is belief in a GAU, a Grand Architect of the Universe. Since Buddhism does not accept a GAU, Buddhists would be technically excluded from masonry on principle.

Relatively speaking, every instant is impermanent, even though the 'chain' of instants has no beginning. The point of dependent origination is that no conditioned entity can arise from anything other than another conditioned entity. All causes are themselves effects, and all effects are themselves causes. There is no room in the logic of dependent origination for a cause that is not an effect of some other cause -- hence there can be no beginnings of any kind at all.

One can easily observe that common people, not educated in tenets, generally believe their statements about the existence and non-existence of things. When a pot is broken, for them it is not a pot anymore. It may have become a broken pot, or shards, but for them the pot that was there is no longer there and has thus become non-existent in their mind. 

Likewise, they believe in simple reality of a pot that they can see. For them the pot "is". 

When it comes to people trained in tenet systems, this question is easier, because of of course, those who subscribe to various Buddhist and non-Buddhist tenet systems subscribe to various sets of beliefs such as those who assert arising from an existent, those who assert arising from a non-existent and so on. 

The Buddhas and Nagarjuna's target at based was really more oriented at the sort of naive realism that people have, especially in regards to rebirth. Naively, some people believe that they exist, and that they will continue to exist after death. Other people, on the other hand, think that after death, they will not exist anymore. 

The root of both these mistaken positions is "is" and "is not" -- for example "I exist now, and I will continue to exist after death" or "I exist now but when I die I will cease to exist". 

We can assume then, based on people's statements and training whether they are naive realists or not, or are trained in some tenet system.

When "is" and "Is not" are views, then they are wrong views and only wrong views. This of course is the reason for parsing "is" and "Is not" in quotations. 

When used simply in conventional discourse and not as views, then of course 'is' and 'is not' are not wrong views since they are not being presented as views. 

Your error is conflating the former with the latter.

"Is" leads to the view of eternalism. "Is not" leads to the view of annihilation. 

Nāgārjuna states:

‘Is’ is holding to permanence,
‘Is not’ is an annihilationist view.
Because of that, is and is not 
are not made into a basis by the wise.

I already explained this, the collective karma (actions) of the sentient beings from the previous universe, ad infinitum. This is all very clearly and consistently explained in Buddha' teachings.

Yes, this is true. This is based on many arguments you will find in Moonbeams of Mahamudra, for example. 

However, the lineage of these kinds of practices are still quite active in Sakya and Nyingma; and presumably, Gelug and Jonang.

Kunzang Dechen Lingpa emphasized that these practices were really quite important. In Nyinthig, the preliminary practice of cultivating bliss in the trio of bliss, clarity and non-conceptuality is consort practice, and Longchenpa devotes an entire text to it alone in Lama Yangthig. 

In the system of Ghantapada's five stages, first you work with a samayamudra (a visualized consort), then eventually you work with a karmamudra in the third, fourth and fifth stages. 

What has happened in Tibet is that the three gsar ma schools have each taken a monolithic approach to the raw material of the writings and teachings of the Indian siddhas and masters. These monolithic approaches ride roughshod over the intricate details and variety found in Indian Buddhist siddha praxis. Also, the dim view that Tibetan kings took of mother tantra, and the practices of "union" and "liberation", etc., really affected the way the Kadampas interpreted the Dharma. 

As far as Gampopa was concerned, he is really more into tattva than mahāmudra and so on, following the treatises of Maitripa. His nephew, Gomsthul asked:

"In terms of the view, what is common and what is superior?"

Gampopa replies:

"In common with cittamatra, everything is gathered into the mind. Cittamatrins however assert the mind as ultimate. Since the essence is that mind does not arise, [our view] is superior. Free from proliferation is common with Madhyamaka, [our view] is superior because of wisdom. The great vehicle of mantra does not assert aspects as true in common with the path of liberation; the mother tantra practitioners  meditate making bliss into the object. The practitioners of the great perfection meditates through making emptiness into an object. The practitioners of mahāmudra meditate through making equanimity into an object. Those are mental fabrications. 

Since reality (the essence that is not fabricated with the mind) is meditated, the essence is superior. 

The parts in common can be seen for yourself. If you understand what that practice has in common, the blessings are great."

Such is the nature of language and the reason conventional discourse, however necessary, is predicated on cognitive error. Relative truth, such as it is, is a product of a deluded cognition. The error that relative truth rests on are the two views "is" and "is not". Nevertheless, we need to resort to conventional discourse in order to communicate the flaws of conventional discourse and so it is necessary to resort to the use of the verb "to be" in all its many forms in order to form intelligible sentences. 

Blame the game, not the player.

It is because the creation stage of the five-fold mahāmudra is considered profound. Gyalpo Rinpoche considers this to be a really important point in his book:

Since that deity, the clear appearance of instantaneous awareness [rig pa skag gcig ma] includes all of the crucial points of the creation stage into one, the profound creation stage is mahamudra.

This is also the case in Sakya. Sachen says:

As such, if one understands the dharmadhātu,
spiritual practice possessing characteristics is not possible;
if one also meditates the creation stage with that [understanding],
[the creation stage] is spiritual practice without characteristics.

The Hevajra Tantra explains it very nicely:

Here there is no method and wisdom,
the appearance of true reality,
can’t be described by another, the innate
cannot be found anywhere,
but one can understand it in dependence on the Guru, 
time and method, and from one’s merit.

For example, Dombhi Heruka divides the innate into three aspects: cause, method and result. 

The cause innate is the nature of the mind.

The method innate is fifteen innate dharmas:

...the innate three ṇāḍīs in the body, innate trio of exhalation, inhalation and abiding of the breath; and the innate as the three poisonous afflictions of the mind6; nine dharmas. In those innates, there is the inner obstacles, the innate three combined diseases; the outer obstacles the innate three demons. 
Now then, the diseases are one, vata; pitta and blood both are counted as one; and kapha are three. The three demons are male class, female class, and nāgā. 
Now fifteen dharmas exist from the beginning of the body’s development, and therefore are the fifteen innate dharmas. 

The three innate experiences of bliss, clarity and non-conceptuality arise on the basis of these fifteen dharmas. 

And the result innate is the three doors of liberation i.e. "Because the samadhis of the trio of pleasure, clarity and non-conceptuality occur, the three ṇāḍīs and the three vāyus are brought under control; one is liberated from the illnesses and the three types of spirits, and one actualizes the three doors of liberation."

Often people have a very restrictive concept of what "sahaja" means. Also the channels in your body are sahaja, the fact that you have one face and two arms is "sahaja" -- that is why two armed, one faced forms of Cakrasamvara and so on are called "sahaja" i.e. natural. In sahaja practice, unlike lower tantra and sutra, we do not reject anything. 

Also, for example, the third Karmapa's commentary on Sahaja Mahamudra remarks that Sahaja Mahamudra is practiced in conjunction with Naro Chödruk. 

Etc. 

Finally, people have a funny idea for example that Tilopa hitting Naropa on the head was the end of Naropa's path. They don't realize that that was the beginning and it was only after that that Tilopa gave Naropa empowerments, practices connected with the channels and so on.

Method: mahamudra without tantra is just perfection of wisdom. 

Method, ultimately, is the most important difference between sutra and tantra.

If you argue that the difference between mahāmudra and perfection of wisdom is guruyoga, I will just respond that guruyoga is a unique method of Annutarayoga tantra. 

So it all boils down to method. Likewise, the difference between Dzogchen and Mahamudra is method. There are also differences in the way the basis is explained and so on, but mostly, the difference is in method. If you are not using Dzogchen methods, you are not practicing Dzogchen. For example, in Kalacakra one works with visions, but it is not the same as thogal, as Dudjom Rinpoche clearly points out in his book.

Now then, the whole concept of "other-power" in Jodo shin shu is really based on this simple principle. A person of shinjin is someone who implicitly trusts Amitabha's aspiration and says his  name once. This is the basis of the debate between "once-calling" and "many-calling".

Tibetan Nomads and the people of the Yarlung Dynasty are two distinct peoples, we agree.

But this is precisely my point, pots are not people. We are not going to learn very much about the roots of Tibetan culture and so on by looking at Zhang Zhung archaeology. We will probably not even learn very much about Bon. 

Bon however is a religion that calls itself "The original pre-Buddhsit religion of Tibet" and therefore, since it sites itself in Zhang Zhung, the motive for doing archaeology in that region is, at this point, inextricably bound up with the question of Bon in Tibetan culture.

Luhipa was the disciple of Saraha II aka Shavaripa. Sapan definitely situates him during the reign of the famed Buddhist king of Bengal, Shri Dharmapala, whose reign extended circa 775 to 810 CE. 

Luihipa was a scribe in the court of Dharmapāla until he met Savaripa. We do not know when Luhipa was active during this 35 year period, but since his retreat was 9-12 years, and since legend holds that Dharmapāla became a disciple of Luhipa, we assume a later date for Luhipa and put his encounter with Dharmapāla around 810. Supposedly Dharmapāla left his kingdom and took a job as a pounder of rice in what is now known as Orrisa becoming known as the siddha Demgipa. 

From Demgipa on, a significant feature of Cakrasamvara practice is the requirement that high cast practitioners take low caste occupations under low cast woman. 

In any event, we have a fairly firm range to date the Cakrasamvara tantra from -- given this we can presume that the Cakrasamvara must date to the early 8th century CE. Since it mentions the Guhyasamaja and a number of other tantras, we can date those, as well as Saraha I, the first Siddha, to the late 7th century CE. 

Also Situ Panchen asserts that Lohipa revealed the Yoginisamcarya tantra, which details the process of the sadhana practice. 

This has a happy consequence for the Mahamudra text in the Vima Nyinthig which mentions Saraha by name.

My statement is a common truism in archaeology i.e. plastic culture does not allow one to extrapolate very much about the people who made this or that thing. 

There are no Celts in the Danube today, that is the point. Likewise, people have this idea that somehow the key to early Tibetan history is locked away in Zhang Zhung archaeology -- but they are looking in the wrong place. The Tibetan people moved into the Tibetan plateau from the lower valleys of the east. This is clearly recorded in Tibetan migration legends of the four major clans.

It is hard to date these texts too. So we really cannot say anything conclusive with regard to gtum mo based on these texts. Further, we know that karmamudra practices predate gtum mo. So, pranāyama combined with karmamudra practices are present from a very early period. The point is, however, we don't know when gtummo practices entered Tibet. 

Quite early, if we accept most of the Kilaya tantras, etc as authentic. If not, then quite late. 

Davidson, I believe as  reference to this fact.

As I said, according to the shravakayana only. 

The Mahayāna account is that Buddha achieved full awakening countless eons ago.
