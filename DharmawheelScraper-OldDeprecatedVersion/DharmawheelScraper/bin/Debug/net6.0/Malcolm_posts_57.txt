As I said, bhumis measure qualities, paths measure realization. 

Since common Mahāyāna has no method connected with the human body, progress is measured by successive appropriation [via rebirth] of ever more refined bodies which are reflected in the gradual refinement of a person's continuum through the process of eradicating the two obscurations and gathering the two accumulations. These are a hard limitation which cannot be detoured around thorugh some conceptual and philosophical trick. 

Vajrayāna, including Dzogchen has a methods connected with the body, and the the resulting paths and stages are measurable via experiences which are described in detail in both Vajrayāna texts and Dzogchen texts. Someone who does not have these experiences does not have the corresponding realizations. These are a hard limitation as well.

From a Madhyamaka pov there no phenomena which do not dependently orginate. From a Buddhist Dzogchen pov, the basis is not established as something real. 

If you think there is something real that exists outside of time, you are deluded beyond hope of recovery. 

The reason we say that the basis is "outside of time" is that from the perspective of the basis itself there are no objects, and time depends on objects. If no objects or entities can be established, how can we talk about dependencies or time? But that does not mean there are no processes, because if there were no processes, the basis could never arise from the basis, and so on. 

There are a lot of differences between Bon and Buddhist Dzogchen. Since Bon Dzogchen is not fully grounded in Buddhism, it is a somewhat eternalistic in its presentation of these issues.

The basis possess three wisdoms, essence, nature and compassion. They manifest as sound, lights and rays. However, the Bonpos place much more emphasis on this doctrine than Buddhist Dzogchen does (where it mainly appears as an explanation of the experience of the bardo). 

My point was that the there are processess in the basis, whether you want to call them "causal" or not is really quite irrelevant. 

And actually Buddhist Dzogchen disagrees with this Bon assessment above. Padmasambhava states:

"Though the trio of essence, nature and compassion exist in reality, they occur as cause, condition and result because of ignorance."

But this is partly why I did not want to get into this. This topic is very complex, and is just a bunch of intellectual proliferation if you are not a practitioner of tögal. Just understand that there are processes in the basis. You can call them spontanous if you want. 

Padmasambhava again states:

The luminous part of vidyā in the basis stirs as the five lights. The karmic winds, the condition of vidyā, cause the colors to appear as a house of light. Since that is not understood as wisdom, delusion cognizing the part of dualistic appearances produces delusion about the duality of subject and object. 

Garab Dorje explains the reason why there is stirring in the basis in his commentary on The Single Son of the All the Buddhas Tantra:

At that time, from the naturally occurring blessings of the personal experience of the realization of the heart essence (snying thig), having recognized one's own state, in one lifetime, everyone will attain the result of Buddhahood. From now on, the emptied pit of samsara will not appear as the six kinds of living beings. For twenty thousand eons, sentient beings will not appear possessing a bodily form having severed the stream of samsara. After that, from the arising of the subtle latent defilements of different actions, samsara and nirvana will arise in the same way as before. 

Why is this possible? Again, the String of Pearls clarifies:

Luminosity itself stores traces.

Luminosity ['od gsal], the nature [rang bzhin], which is the naturally formed [lhun grub] aspect of the basis, stores traces. 

As I said, these issues are subtle, difficult and would take a long time to properly flesh out. Since these things take a long to time to flesh out, and since the explanation of the basis and the arising of the basis and so on and forth is really only relevant to tögal practice and is meant to provide a basis for understanding the result of that practice, delving into explorations of that topic prior to understanding the context of that explanation causes people to become trapped in a lot of useless conceptual proliferation. 

Incidentally, I do not appreciate the tone of your comments.

First, one has to distinguish the general theory of dependent origination from the specific theory of dependent origination. The general theory, stated by the Buddha runs "where this exists, that exists, with the arising of that,this arose". The specific theory is the afflicted dependent origination of the tweleve nidanas. There is however also a non-afflicted dependent origination of the path. For the most part, Madhyamaka covers the principle general dependent originationi order to show that all dependent phenomena are empty. Since, according to Madhyamaka, there are no phenonomena that are not dependent, the emptiness of non-dependent phenomena is never an issue, like hair on a tortoise or the son of a barren woman, since there are no non-dependent phenomena at all. 

Nagarjuna however does discuss the twelve nidanas, ignorance and so on, in chapter 28 of the MMK. 

The basis in Dzogchen is completely free of affliction, it therefore is not something which ever participates in afflicted dependent origination. Unafflicted causality in Dzogchen is described as lhun grub, natural formation. However, since there is causality in the basis, it also must be empty since the manner in which the basis arises from the basis is described as "when this occurs, this arises" and so on. The only reasons why this can happen is because the basis is also completely empty and illusory. It is not something real or ultimate, or truly existent in a definitive sense. If it were, Dzogchen would be no different than Advaita, etc. If the basis were truly real, ulimate or existent, there could be no processess in the basis, Samantabhadra would have no opportunity to recognize his own state and wake up and we sentient beings would have never become deluded. So, even though we do not refer to the basis as dependently originated, natural formation can be understood to underlie dependent origination; in other words, whatever is dependently originated forms naturally. Lhun grub after all simply and only means "sus ma byas", not made by anyone. 

Rigpa is not a phenomena, it is not a thing, per se. It is one's knowledge of the basis. Since it is never deluded, it never participates in affliction, therefore, it is excluded from afflicted dependent orgination. However, one can regard it as the beginning of unafflicted dependent origination, and one would not be wrong i.e. the nidanas of samsara begin with avidyā; the nidanas of nirvana begin with vidyā (rigpa).

There are other texts in the cycle of the dgongs pa zang thal that define the basis further: The Second Vairocana aural lineage from the dgongs pa zang thal cycle claries this:

Since the basis was understood to be emptiness that has been forever cleansed, the path was not deluded by conceptual dualism. Since the result, the great wisdom expanded, the example of the great empty essence is “like space”. The example for the great luminosity of one’s vidyā is like the union of the sun and moon.

The way the Adibuddha arose: that latent basis is not established at all. When the time arrived, since that previously explained trio of vāyu, vidyā and space separated, the energy of space self-originated as kayās; the energy of vāyu self-originated as speech, and the energy of vidyā self-arose as mind. Since the body, speech and mind originated as self-originated from that basis that was not established in any way, compassionate vidyā did not engage in pride, object and mind were not separated into two. The mind that grasps external and internal did not arise, there was no clinging to the non-dual, he recognized his own face, severed mental proliferation, reversed clinging into dharmatā, instantly understood objects of knowledge, and since wisdom arise in himself, he fully awakened. 

The point here is that the referred to basis is emptiness and it is not established in anyway at all. 

Because the basis is emptiness, dependent origination is not contradicted. 

The term dependent orgination is used differently in Dzoghen texts that in Madhyamaka. In Dzogchen texts it refers generally to post imuting ignorance state of six realms.

I was purely responding to your assertion that dependent origination does not equal emptiness. The two terms are in fact synonyms. 

I nowhere stated that I negated the conventionlly observed efficacy of karma and its results, nor would I. 

However, we can examine karma too if you like. Nāgārjuna states:

"Why? This action
does not arise from conditions,
and does not arise without conditions, 
therefore, there is also no agent. 

If there is no agent, 
how can there be an result which arises from an action?
If there is no result, 
where will a consumer be observed?

Just as the Teacher's emanation
is emanated through his consummate magical power,
if likewise the emanation also makes an emanation,
there is again a further emanation; 

in same the way, though that agent
performs an action, it has the form an emanation.
For example, it is like another emanation created by an emanation
making a [third] emanation.

Affliction, actions, bodies,
agents, and results
are like fairy castles
mirages, and dreams. 

I take Nāgārjuna's view. All phenomena are completely equivalent with illusions.

The week long cleanse in the rgyud bzhi is fine, very simple, but, in my opinion, is a little too simple. It is for a time when people were less toxified in general. 

Everyone, across the board, who is in reasonable good health, should so a cleanse in the spring and in the fall. Ayruvedic practitioners time it with two festivals, one that occurs in April, another than occurs in October. So that is when I do it to.

It is not real. This principle can be known (rig pa) by the mind, but cannot be realized with the mind. This is why, in Dzogchen teadchings, the realization of emptiness and the so called "full measure of rig pa" occur at one and the same time. At that time your knowledge of reality becomes complete.

You should seperate Vimala from Magnesium citrate by about an hour. Vimala may be used as needed. It can be made a little more effective by taking it with warm milk or a small spot of brandy, port, or other aged alchohol. Vimala may also be taken early in the morning to calm anxiety.

AFAIK, while there are spirits or demons associated with most diseases, called "disease lords", they are not specific to a given organ, but rather govern a class of disease as a whole. Religious practice is always a component in any Tibetan medical treatment. So, the answer is yes and no. Yes in general, no on the specifics.

Of these, killing, stealing, sexual misconduct and lying are covered in the vows, as well as intoxicants, for a total of five lay precepts or vows.

Never. It has to do with the theory of needle in Tibetan medicine -- i.e. it is used mainly for inflammation and heat diseases i.e. pitta and blood. It is considered a cold and rough therapy, not good for vata and kapha at all. So I always especially recommend that vata-deranged people generally avoid acupuncture unless there is serious reason for them to use it to cut the end of a heat disease. 

Tibet is a cold place, China is a hot place. There are more heat diseases in China than Tibet. Our Moxa is much more developed than Chinese moxabustion. Why? Tibet is a cold country.

All traditions are of buddhism are working towards the same goal, freedom from afflictions that are the cause of suffering. Some buddhist traditions, from Mahayāna on up, also aim at omniscience. 

Omniscience is not as scary as it sounds. A Buddhas omniscience is predicated on the fact that all objects of knowledge, including buddhahood itself, are completely illusory. 

This is also the view of Dzogchen i.e. everything, including buddhahood, etc., is completely equivalent to an illusion; not "like an illusion", as some people in Mahāyāna with a poor understanding hedge -- completely equivalent.

One: bodhicitta in sems sde is not something that is considered real; cit is sat i.e. real in Advaita. 

Two: there are two basic ways the term "non-dual" is used in Buddhism: free from subject and object perception (trivial) and free from ontic extremes (non-trivial). 

Three, sometimes the word "non-dual" in translation is misleading. Here is an example from sem sde. This:

rgyu dang 'bras bu gnyis las 'das
sems can sangs rgyas gnyis med pas
sangs rgyas sems kyis sgrub ma byed

It might be translated as:
Beyond the duality of cause and result,
since sentient beings and buddhas are non-dual,
buddhahood is not accomplished with the mind. 

But that translation would be a little wrong. 

A better way to render it would be:

Beyond both cause and result,
since both sentient beings and buddhas to do not exist
buddhahood is not accomplished with the mind.

What is the difference you ask? Here there is a pair, a cause and a result i.e. sentient being are a cause, buddhas are a result. But since neither exist, therefore, buddhahood cannot be accomplished with mind. 

These issues are often quite subtle.

As Nāgārjuna states:

It is extremely important that key concepts be treated with care. It is also very important to avoid using language shared with other philosophical systems. I know any number of people who really are under the impression that there is really no difference between Dzogchen, Advaita and so on. And mostly, it is because of this pesky word "non-duality". 

There is just as much danger of mental dulness and so with an eternalist view as there is with a nihilist view. In both cases, the conclusion will be reached that view is not important, karma does not matter, and so on.

There is no actual state or condition that is free from duality. If one should think that there is, one will have not understood one single thing about Buddha Dharma. 

Because people think there is a real state free from dualistic extremes, they fall into the pit of eternalism and grasping, never even recognizing emptiness correctly, let alone realizing it, and hampering their understanding of dependent origination. 

Thinking there is such a thing as a real state of non-duality is precisely the Advaita Vedanta, Trika and so on.

Appearances are often deceiving. 

While Tulku Thundup is certainly a qualified teacher -- he is not a native English speaker, I don't think he knows Sanskrit all that well, and he does not edit his own material. 

As I said, gnyis med is certainly used frequently in Buddhist texts, but it should never be translated as non-duality, since it is missing the -ity part i.e. nyid or tā. 

Because of imprecise translations there are many people indeed who think that basic message of Mahāyāna Buddhism, Zen, Dzogchen, Mahāmudra, and so on are exactly the same as Advaita. In particular this is demonstrated the by the convergance of Zen and Advaita in such teachers as Adyshanti, etc., and some of his students, such as Loach Kelley, who also has studied Dzogchen. 

Crystal is a book taught by a Tibetan in Italian, not his native language, translated on the fly by someone without deep knowledge of Buddhism in general [Barry Simmons] and edited by John Shane, also someone without a deep knowledge of Buddhism. 

While Crystal is one of my favorite books of all time, it is not without its flaws, and for this and that reason it was almost allowed to die. It was re-edited quite a bit, however, and has its present form. It is still not a perfect book in every respect. 

I also know a lot of people in Dzogchen Community who are confused about the difference between non-dual and non-duality. 

It is an important issue only because it is at the root of much confusion for so many people.

That reason why Norbu Rinpoche says this is because Dzogchen is predicated on an understanding of the human body that founded on medical ideas current in Tibet and India at that time. 

In Dzogchen,the rtsal or energy of wisdom, ye shes, is specifically stated to be located in the brain. And the brain is specifically stated to be the organ that coordinates input from the five material sense organs. This is symbolized by the presence of the mandala of the 58 herukas in the brain, just as the eight consciousness are symbolized by the presence of the 42 peaceful deities in the heart. 

Also, the two truths is not an important concept in Dzogchen, or as ChNN put it to me in person 19 years ago, "In Dzogchen there is only one truth, not two truths".

Why? This is a mere assertion on your part. 

Why limit one part of a Buddha's sensory apparatus when you don't, for example, limit his tongue? A Buddha's tongue, according to reports, can see and hear. Why should a Buddha's brain be restricted to some limitation if the rest of his body is not? 

The reason why buddhas are omniscient is that all objects of knowledge are illusory. Omniscience is not a function of memory addresses in a chip, after all. There should be no reason why having a human brain should limit a buddha at all. A buddha without a human brain however is an impossibility since possession of a fully favored human body with all senses intact and functioning is a defined precondition for awakening. It is also a defined precondition for receiving Vajrayāna empowerments. Why? If one's organs are damaged and incomplete, it is held that ones body mandala is incomplete and that one will not be able to fully awaken in a single lifetime via Vajrayāna methods.

For Nāgārjuna, stating that things exist is a statement that they inherently exist. 

Therefore, the only existence that Nāgārjuna was willing to grant phenomena was what we term a relative or nominal existence. Thus he is saying "...that the Earth, universe, and multi-verses do not intrinsically exist as such" "in a spirit of recognizing the universality of pratītyasamutpāda and sūnyatā".

The Rig pa rang shar tantra states:

"Child of a good family, at the time of nirvana when wisdom moves in the sky from the appearance of wisdom rising up from the basis having slipped from grasp of the body,vidyā moves in the sky traveling through the pathway of the eye. Furthermore, it should be understood in the following way: the vidyā from the heart dissolves into a thigle. The thigle dissolves into a lamp. The lamp dissolves into light. The light dissolve into a form. The form dissolves into a cluster. The cluster dissolves into wisdom. Wisdom dissolves into natural formation (lhun grub). After natural formation dissolves into great original purity, the stages are complete. The appearance of the manner of dissolution and the manner of liberation of those persons who have seen the truth is just like that."


The Great Tantra of Beatiful Good Fortune states:

Since the reality of vidyā and dharmatā
exist like the surface of a mirror,
never being obscured by the condition of ignorance (avidyā)
is called "great original purity".

This is a species of Buddhist doceticism. 

Dharmakāya, in brief, has several different versions. The basis version is that Dharmakāya is the complete realization of emptiness and the omniscience that springs from that realization. 

Sambhogakāya is, in this basic version, rarified form body which exists outside samsara and is responsible primarily for communicating dharma to advanced bodhisattvas. 

Nirmanakāya manifest to ordinary beings. 

These terms get used differently in Vajrayāna systems where the three kāyas are understood as different aspects of the nature of the mind, clarity, emptiness and the inseparability of the two.

If you are a lay tantric practitioner you need to practice the yoga of passion, perceving yourself as a heruka and your partner as a dakini (for example, Kalacakra and Vishvamata). The yoga of passion is not connected with the completion stage, it is connected with the creation stage, so there is no need to worry about losing semen and so on. 

As far as which orifice, etc., this is mainly a sutrayāna affair. There are no restrictions for a practitioner practicing the yoga of passion. The body of a deity is completely pure.

It is nevetheless, the correct one, and the only one that rescues Nāgārjuna from the fetter of being accused of being a terrible logician. In fact, the caturskoti is not all that important in Madhyamaka -- too much of if it has been made by Western enthusiaists of Nāgārjuna. 

In fact, the whole eight-fold negation of the mangalam is predicated on the fact that dependently arisen phenomena do not in fact arise, hence Nāgārjuna says of dependent origination: not ceasing, not arising, etc., when he praise the Buddha for teaching dependent origination.

Since phenomena do not arise , here again is a cascading negation of the other seven possibilities. If there is no arising, there can be no cessation, permanence, impermanence and so on. 

In reality it is very simple, but if one should approach these texts with the wrong set of assumptions about language and so on, they will seem very strange and illogical. If you approach them with the correct set of assumptions about language (i.e. Nāgārjuna's) based on a close read of the texts in either Sanskrit or Tibetan, freed from the constraints of later Tibetan polemics or later Sino-Japanese Buddhist metaphysical speculations ala tathāgatagarbha, it is all very straight forward and somewhat boring.

The Caturskoti itself is based on assumptions about language and meaning, that is why it is failure when subjected to formal logic as a simple formal statement i.e. -(x, -x, x+(-x), -(x+(-x))). 

However, the first statement (x) of the Caturskoti is not established, there is a cascading negation. This has to do with the linquistic parameters Nāgārjuna frames existence and non-existence in, in chapter 15 where he states quite explicitly that a non-existent is what people commonly call an existent that has changed its state into something else.

No, this is actually not correct. In order for there to be samsara in the basis, there must be ignorance in the basis. But there isn't. This is why it is said that basis is originally pure [ka dag]. The Rosary of Pearls tantra states:

within the original purity of the initial state,
likewise, how can there be non-delusion?
Therefore, pure of delusion from the beginning.


What you have presented above is a common mahamudra misunderstanding of what "basis" means in Dzogchen.

Basically there are, in the terminology of Dzogchen itself, three classes of vehicles; vehicles of the cause (sravaka through bodhisattvayānas), vehicles of the result (kriya tantra through anuyoga), and the vehicle beyond cause and result i.e. Dzogchen. 

We can classify them by path as well, renunication, transformation and self-liberation. 

Each vehicle is so called because it offers a complete path to liberation. One can attain the stature of an ārya through any one of the nine vehicles. In this respect, all nine vehicles stand alone and are independent from one another and may be taught as self-sufficient paths. 

So, it is an error to assert that Dzogchen is a seperate vehicle, but the others are not. All nine vehicles have the necessary teachings to bring someone to the state of being an ārya. 

Whether they can bring one to the state of perfect buddhahood, however, is a different story. Indirectly, all are capable of doing so. Only the three inner yanas can do so in a single lifetime.

In our world system, Dzogchen is part of Vajrayana, in general.

A proper understanding of emptiness is required, but not the realization of emptiness. If the realization of emptiness were required to have vidyā (knowledge of the basis), no one who was not an ārya on the stages could practice Dzogchen at all. 

The realization of emptiness is also not a requirement for the basic requirement of tregchö i.e. stable placement in a momentary uncontrived awareness (ma bcos pa shes pa skad gcig ma). A proper understanding of emptiness is required. 

Further, the experience of emptiness, while necessary, is not at all the same thing as realizing emptiness. The experience of emptiness is experiencing an awareness [shes pa] free of concepts, often referred to as recognizing the gap between two thoughts. If you follow the teaching of Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, terming this experience "dharmakāya", as some teachers do, is a big mistake. It is just an impermanent experience.

There are three explanations possible, given that Dzogchen tantras and traditions definitely state that Samantabhadra was intiallly subject to either one or two ignorances (ma rig pa, avidyā):

1) The Dzogchen assertion that all sentient beings attain "full awakening (sangs rgyas)" at the end of a given mahākalpa requires interpetation and must not be taken literally.
2) Buddhahood is, up to a point, in fact reversible.
3) Buddhas and sentient beings newly form at the beginning of a mahākalapa. 

All three possibilities present problems in terms of traditional Indian Mahāyāna Buddhology. 

This controversy first came to my attention when my Sakya khenpo mentioned it in passing in the early '90's.

It is a trivial point because time is merely a convention. There is no time or continuity at all, other than conventionally. In Dzogchen, that which is shared with Madhyamaka can be considered trivial since we are not discussing something unique and specific to Dzogchen teachings. 

Also the term "intrinsic awareness" is a translation misnomer that has, unfortunately, gained broad currency. Using the term "intrinsic awareness" for "rig pa/vidyā" is very limiting. First of all, the adjective "intrinsic is misapplied. Intrinsic describes a quality that something else possesses. For example, diamonds are intrinsically hard; gold is intrinsically shiny; water is intrinsically wet. [X] is intrinsically aware? The intrinsic awareness of what? Of what is awareness an intrinsic quality?

There are other problems to this translation which lead people to reify rigpa as some truly existing ground ala Advaita's brahman.

I think they uncritacally accepted the worldview handed down to them. I also think they had no tools to evaluate cosmological statements related to time and so on. 

Sorry, when it comes to measuring the physical universe, we have a better understanding of it than ancient peoples. 

In terms of eons, modern humans have only been out of Africa for 70,000 years or so. 

The rest of it is religious speculation. 

This of course does not mean that sentient life is confined to this planet, or that huge time frames mentioned in sutras are not relevant -- but there are issues with applying the fantastic numbers mentioned in sutras and so on to this planet and this crop of human beings. 

On the other hand, it is fruitless to provide substitute speculations. 

So we have to deal with two facts. Modern humans have only been present on the Indian subcontinent for at most 70,000 years. This fact stands in contradiction to traditional narratives about the history of Jambudvipa. 

We should default to modern understanding, since it corresponds with the perception of ordinary people and is all that can be confirmed with any empirical certainty. 

The beliefs of ancient Buddhist masters about the history of the world are pretty irrelevant.

Title: Re: Difference between recognizing rigpa & realizing emptiness?

I did. It is pretty straight forward. To put it another way, when a person ceases to reify phenomena in terms of the four extremes, that is the direct perception of emptiness. Until that point, their "emptiness" remains an intellectual sequence of negations; accurate perhaps, but conceptual nevertheless. 

The "recognition" of rigpa, which is simply the knowledge (rig pa) about one's state as a working basis for practice, does not require realization of emptiness as a prerequiste, and can't -- since if it did, no one could practice Dzogchen. '

In terms of the four visions, for as long as one continues to reify phenomena, for that long, one will never reach the third vision. This is the principal reason in modern Dzogchen practice, emphasis is placed on the basis through tregchö, rather the path, tögal. If you are a first stage bodhisattva and so on, then the four visions in Dzogchen will be very, very rapid. However, there is no gaurantee that one will realize emptiness merely through practicing tregchö. Of this reason then, practices such as tummo, etc. are also recommended.

not seeing the face of the mandala of the empowerment, 
corrupting his commitments, 
unable to respond to questions, 
little education, very proud,
the unqualified master is a student’s demon,
not being a master who can teach secret mantra,
he cannot teach dzogchen Ati.

Longchenpa adds:

"If one associates with such a Guru, one impairs all temporary good, and ultimately one falls into samsara and lower realms."

At least your prospective Guru must have a good education in secret mantra; that implies he has a good education in sutra. Sometimes, even a realized person is not necessarily a good teacher, more like pratyekabuddhas than bodhisattvas.

Well, we have a lot of evidence. 

One, there is a text by Sakya Pandita that describes very well how Indians in different regions of India such as central India and Kashmir pronounced Sanskrit -- and he was personally acquainted with 30 panditas. 

Two, Indians in the described regions still pronounce Sanskrit in the manner in which Sapan says they did 800 years ago. 

Three, pronunciation of Sanskrit is a major obsession with Brahmins since the proper pronunciation of the Vedas and vedic rites is considered crucial for their effectiveness. The similarities and (minor) differences in Sanskrit pronunciation between different brahmin traditions in India is well understood and mapped. 

Four, changes in pronunciation can be accurately mapped mathematically (and are). I am sure you have encountered structural linguistics. I am not arguing that everything Sausurre said is true, but there are regular rules to phonetic shifts in Indo-europoean lanaguages and nothing in the Indian subcontinent that makes a sibilant ṣ or ś shift to a fricative kh possible.

The regularity with which Tibetans mispronounce both ṣ and ś when they are present in the middle of Sanskrit words indicates this is a pronunciation that is not an Indo-European language issue and instread is a Tibetan linguistic issue -- for example, I have heard Tibetans mispronounce kośa (kosha, mispronounced "kokha") with the same regularity as they mispronounce aṣṭa (saying "akha") or say Bhekhenze for Bhaiṣajye. In other words, mono-lingual Tibetans have a hard time pronouncing sibilants present in the middle of words since in Tibetan there are no sibilants present in the middle of a word. A Tibetan who has no problem pronouncing "bud shing" (firewood, and two separate words) will mispronounce kośa everytime unless they have received specific Sanskrit training.

It is a certainty that no Indian master ever recited Bhaiṣajya as Bhekenze or supoṣyo as Supo kayo. This leaves only Tibetans to mispronounce these mantras and transmit them in that fashion. Which means if the mantra is effective for them in this mispronounced fashion, it is certain that if one receives the transmission and then corrects the pronunciation, it will be as effective.

Basically, the reason why your argument is fallacious is because if you argue that a Tibetan pronunciation of a mantra is effective even though it is incorrect, then there is no fault in reciting mantras properly. Why, because presumably the mantra was communicated to a Tibeten who pronounced kili as chili, there is no logical reason why a mantra transmitted by a Tibetan as chili pronounced kili will not be equally as effective (especially since it is the original pronunciation). You are arguing that it only one way i.e. Tibetans can mispronounce mantras and gain siddhi. But we cannot. This is foolish.

I don't agree. Why? Originally the mantra was mispronounced by some Tibetan who got it from an Indian teacher. His teacher said supoṣyo, he said Supo kaya. There is absolutely no fault in restoring the proper pronunciation. No blessings are lost, no sacred "power" is lost. In this respect I completely disagree with anyone who says one must recite mantras according to manner in which one's teacher pronounces them if that manner is not consistent with the rules of Sanskrit pronunciation. It is illogical to maintain this position. It is basically an argument for blind faith. In this respect, in my opinion, Sakya Paṇḍita's position is best. Of course people are free to choose what they wish to do.

In general, the Sakyapa approach is as Kevin suggested ie. Sanskrit pronunciation of Sanskrit mantras, according to all the Sakya masters I have studied with. No Benzar, Bazar, and so on. 

I presonally recite things as best I can according to how Sanskrit is pronounced by Varanasi brahmins. I fail of course, but I try. 

Not all mantras are in Sanskrit, there are some in Tibetan, and other languages, BTW.

It is not a Tibetan mispelling. 

The Tibetans deliberately employed tsa tsha dza to represent the Sanskrit ca cha and ja to differentiate Sanskrit words from Tibetan words. Thus, we are to understand that tsa tsha dza are to be pronounced ca cha and ja hence ཙིཏཏ་ should never be transliterated tsitta into English, it should only be transliterated "citta" since that is what is intended.

The mani is a dharani, so here is a sutra system for chanting it. Arapacana is also from sutra. 

The tantras you are mentioning are so called "kalpa" tantras, sections of sutra that are also classfied as kriya tantra, so again, no contradiction. Most of the mantras that Chinese people are chanting are from sutra or dharani texts. Many of these were also translated from Chinese into Tibetan. 

But this will not work with Vajrakilaya, etc. You must have the transmission. 

Medicine Buddha, Tara, etc., kriya deities from the Buddha and Lotus families may not require intiation (but that depends too), but mantras from the Vajra family of Kriya tantra definitely require initiation since they are connected with controlling Guhyakas.

Inseparability = tathāgatatagarbha. 

According to the Sakya masters, ālaya has two aspects -- its ultimate truth aspect is the dharmadhātu; its relative truth aspect is the  ālayavijñāna. Because the ultimate nature of the ālaya is the dharmadhātu, nirvana is possible. Because the relative truth aspect of the ālaya is ālayavijñāna, samsara is possible. Since the two truths are inseparable, samsara and nirvana are inseparable. 

Hence the special Sakya view is well known as 'khor 'das dbyer med, the inseparability of samsara and nirvana. Sūtra inseparability of samsara and nirvana may be found in the Heart Sūtra. The tantric view of inseparability of samsara and nirvana may be found in the Hevajra tantra.

Following Sakya Pandita, Gorampa, in the first section of his three vows commentary, very clearly shows that clarity cannot be tathāgatagarbha since it is conditioned; and emptiness cannot be tathāgatagarbha, since it is the extreme of cessation. 

Tathāgatagarbha, according to the standard, orthodox Sakya view is the inseparabilty of clarity and emptiness.

As to question two, Amitabha is the master of the family of the lotus family. Padmasambhava is regarded as an emanation, a nirmanakāya. Therefore, his Sambhogakāya manifestation is Avaokiteshvara and his Dharmakāya manifestation is Amitabha, just as for example, S̄akyamuni's family is the tathāgata family, his dharmakāya manifestation is Samantabhadra and his Sambhogakāya manifestation is Vairocana. 

As for Padmasambhava, this is an idea that comes from the treasure tradition. I don't think I have seen an early pre-treasure tradition text that makes this claim.

Yes, the way I see it, they actually are exaggerating the news items, the arrest reports and so on, trying to show those records in the worst possible light, and going to a lot of effort to dig up trash about one guy and publishing a lot of hearsay about him, some of which may actually be libelous. 

We only really have their story here. We do not have Cassidy's side of the story, do we? That is why I am saying that you are taking a side since you are only taking one source for your information. 

As I see it, there is nothing particularly wrong with writing a book about knife-fighting techniques. Not to my taste, but not illegal. Certainly I know a lot of Buddhists (including famous contemporary teachers) that are totally into weapons -- guns, knives, swords, you name it. 

Basically, how Buddhist is it to put someone in jail? Bodhisattvas are supposed to free people from shackles, not place them in shackles. Bodhisattvas should exercise patience and restraint, not engage in systematic group smear campaigns. 

In other words, I said he has some interesting things to say on his blog -- you come back with all this heavy stuff about why this is terrible. If Cassidy was just some schmuck claming to be a tulku and writing a blog, we wouldn't give any of this a second thought -- it would be at best a minor disagreement. But because he has a record, and he tangled with a wealthy religious organization, he is being screwed to the wall, and this is taking on much more of a life than it really deserves. Hell, G Gordon Liddy has interesting things to say sometimes (not often these days), and he makes Cassidy look like a cub scout.

I don't think the situation between him and his ex-wife is nearly as cut and dry as you claim. He was convicted of a crime for which he did not plead guilty. He entered an Alford plea. 

Whether you like it or not, you are taking a side. 

As far as E-Sangha goes, there are numerous people I know who used sock puppets for various reasons on E-Sangha who post here on Dharma Wheel. The only thing I can say about Cassidy is that when his ip was banned, he did not push it. He let it go with only minor complaints on his blog.

I have a dispassionate view about this. No one is better than anyone else. Everyone has done something frak up, either in this life or another. Cassidy has an army of people who hate him and talk shit about him. So, his karma sucks, he has pissed off a lot of people, seems to have a talent for it, and nevertheless, his blog is still of interest and has he interesting things to say, also boring things to say too. It is not like everything he ever wrote is fantastic. 

He is a Buddhist outlaw, perhaps that is why I have a bit sympathy for him. He is also in poor health, in jail, and has a bad ticker.

Good thing the issue of who has and who has not committed a crime is not up the FBI or the police. 

Whether someone has or has not committed a crime is something that is up to the courts to decide. However, sometimes, for reasons inpenetrable to others, people plead guilty to crimes they did not commit. Often, in the US, they are convicted for crimes they did not commit, while others, who are comitting crimes, go unpunished, due to reasons of status, money, power, or race.

When he read Adzom Drugpa's collected works, he found the same text,more or less the same, for over a hundred pages in length. Then he decided he was actually the reincarnation of Adzom Drugpa. He is also recognized as the reincarnation of a completely different Sakya Lama.

First of all "mind" here is short for "awakened mind" i.e. bodhicitta or the nature of the mind. It does pervade all of your own appearances. It is an all=creating king because all appearances are constructed by your mind and come from your mind, thus it is a king since it is the dominates all of this constructive activity. It's nature is inexpressible since it is empty from the very beginning and not established as something ultimately real in its own right. 

Also this book is sems sde class, which means it is commentary on the completion stage of Mahāyoga and does not really stand as an independent tradition. No one attains rainbow body through sems sde alone.

There are two answers to this question in Dzogchen. 

a) external phenomena are projections of minds. A mind is capable of projecting an appearance for another mind: classical example, the woman who meditates on herself as a tigresss and terrifies her village. 

b) external phenomena are a result of causes and conditions; their appearance is a result of traces -- for example, the liquid that has six different appearances according to how it is perceived by beings of the six realms. 

As far as the latter is concerned, Longchenpa observes that phenomena are not mental factors, as in yogacara.

Crimes &amp; Tulkus: Poisonous Snakes in Buddhist Robes
Some people have asked me if I’m the “man named Andrew Wilson” that a certain tulku is mentioning on her Web site as having had his house searched by the FBI for evidence relating to the purported crimes of another man named “William Cassidy,” aka "Tenpa Rinpoche." I am that Andrew Wilson. But I don’t know anything about any cyberstalking crimes by a William Cassidy. 

I do know something about being criminally cyberstalked, however, because for almost a whole year two saffron-robed psychopaths stalked me (although I’d blocked them and all their ilk) through various both official and anonymous Twitter accounts and through anonymous hate blogs on which they posted many of my Zen/Taoist “tweets” accompanied by the most outrageously foolish, not to mention slanderous, commentary. 

According to these two "Buddhist" stalkers -- a crazy looking lady wearing a crown and too much make-up and a mousy little man in monk's robes -- my Twitter page was actually authored by William Cassidy, and the various different handles and avatars I went through to try to get clear of their relentlessly negative attentions were all William Cassidy’s “sock puppets,” and my insistence on remaining anonymous behind names like “Akebonojishi” and “Mujinkyo” was all by itself absolute and conclusive proof that I must really be Tenpa Rinpoche trying to pull a fast one on the whole world. It seems not to have occurred to these racketeering co-frauds that my insistence on anonymity was precisely a way of trying to keep the emphasis off my "self" and on what I have to say (about Zen). But logic has never been the strong suit of religious fanatics. 

So incensed were the two bizarre and unwholesome Bogus-sattvas by my continued presence on Twitter that last spring and summer they resorted to harassing almost every single Twitter user who RTd or even spoke to me. Many of the people they harassed got quite spooked by it, so it became almost impossible at times for me to reach anyone with my notes and comments on Zen/Haragei. (A pity, since the techniques I show people how to do actually work, and nobody even has to pay to support my lavish Guru lifestyle.) They particularly swarmed, attacked and mocked anyone who dared to call me "Sensei" or thanked me for helping out with a specific problem. Their paranoia rose to an obsessive crescendo of mean-spirited ridicule and tiresome victim-babble that was endlessly echoed and amplified by a beggar's chorus of the organization's so-called nuns, each with her own Twitter page devoted to singing the Guru's praises and savaging the Guru's purported enemies. 

I've never experienced any Internet madness quite like it. The threatening rage and vituperation on open display from a rural Maryland rattler's nest of "Vajrayana Buddhists" was surreal, David Lynch-esque even. Many of the tweets were disturbing, threatening messages hinting obscurely at magical attacks, promising the most extreme karmic retribution, and prophesying a long stay in Vajra Hell. But there were also more routine threats of the "we-know-where-you-live" and "we-have-people-on-the-payroll-who-take-care-of-people-like-you" variety. (The "Mafia" style tweets felt especially dissonant coming from smiling nuns.) Naturally, I've already downloaded hundreds of pages of this stupefying horse-shit from Twitter and Google caches, and will be making it available to the right people as and when needed.

Those same two unbelievably sad, bewildered and angry co-conspirators now claim that even though it has been proven beyond any possible doubt that I was not, as they swore up down and sideways to everyone who would listen (including the FBI), William Cassidy himself, still I must somehow be connected to the man, who is sitting in jail right now -- and they publish their ignorant, libelous opinion about a person unknown to them along with my name on the official blog of their purported Sangha. Psychopath that she is, the tulku in question still often mentions me and sometimes RTs my tweets mockingly on her Twitter page, never mind that she is now and always has been "blocked," and uses the same type of inflammatory language about me she did all last year. Neither the mentally deranged tulku nor the emotionally and intellectually stunted monk capo have yet acknowledged any error in judgement, nor offered the barest hint of an apology. However, at some point they did quietly remove every last scrap of the "hard evidence" supposedly proving that I am William Cassidy they'd posted on their anonymous "Protecting Nyingma" attack blog. Huh! I wonder why they would do that!

The Deadly Viper Assassination Cult Buddhists
I've been posting Zen notes, poems and aphorisms on Twitter since the summer of 2009. In December of that year, two very strange people began cyberstalking and harassing me through multiple Web sites and multiple (mostly anonymous) Twitter accounts. Their names are Alyce Zeoli -- aka "Jetsunma Ahkon Lhamo," the controversial "founder and spiritual director" of an organization called the Kunzang Palyul Choling -- and David Williams, a so-called monk in that same purportedly Buddhist organization. 

The reason for these two weird people cyberstalking me, and relentlessly harassing anybody with whom I interacted on Twitter, is still mysterious. Although they often claimed that since my Twitter account was anonymous (as it was at the time, though clearly not anymore) I must have something to hide, and therefore was beyond any possible doubt an enemy of theirs named "William Cassidy" aka Tenpa Rinpoche, they also spent an inordinate amount of time and energy trying to argue with, contradict and debunk me on matters of Zen and "Buddhism." (Note: even now that they must know I'm not him, they still regularly mention and "retweet" my postings with mocking and derisory comments attached. Strange!) 

Unfortunately, I did not take their many threats seriously enough, and failed to contact the police. 

However, these two mentally disturbed people did not fail to collect any and every annoyed or exasperated counter-tweet of mine, some of them containing what might be considered by drawing room standards moderately rough language, though not so much so for the Internet, and these tweets they forwarded to the FBI with a complaint that I was cyberstalking Alyce Zeoli -– a person I'd never even heard about until the first of her childish insults appeared on my Twitter stream, and a person I truly wish I’d never had the displeasure of hearing about. 

Naturally, the two bizarre individuals in question neglected to inform the FBI about their own incessantly negative and provocative, often quite creepy, online activities against me and a few unlucky others. However, I've since downloaded hundreds of pages from Twitter and Google caches documenting just this. I expect to soon be making all of this puerile, repugnant cult material available for easy perusal by anyone with the patience and the stomach for it. 

The FBI's research department must be slacking off, because as a result of Alyce Zeoli's complaint a team of FBI agents in dark clothing broke into my Oregon home before dawn on the morning of February 15th, 2011 and handcuffed my girlfriend and I at gunpoint. This was rather traumatic for my girlfriend, who had no idea what was going on. Actually, I didn't either. The agents then read out a search warrant for our computer equipment and cell phones and questioned us both on the cheerful joint topic of "Jetsunma Ahkon Lhamo" and "William Cassidy." They also spent an inordinate amount of time searching the basement and greenhouse, as if they hoped to find explosives or a maybe a cache of Tommy guns. I told them they were raiding the wrong compound; they must have taken a wrong turn at Albequerque, because where they really belonged was the Kunzang Palyul Choling enclave in Maryland. They informed me that the FBI agent who filed the affidavit leading to the armed invasion of my home is based, surprise, in Baltimore. 

I later learned that on that very same morning William Cassidy was arrested in California and transported to Baltimore. He has apparently been sitting in the federal wing of a maximum security prison ever since, with motions for a trial on charges of "cyberstalking" Alyce Zeoli, who -- ironically -- out of her many absurd aliases and honorifics will perhaps become best known as the "Victim 1" of court documents, scheduled for this fall. (See U.S. vs. Cassidy.) 

Leaving aside notable constitutional issues, the government's whole case seems to hinge on the wild claim that Alyce Zeoli is a "victim" of cyberstalking and harassment via Twitter and various Websites run by William Cassidy. But if Alyce Zeoli and David Williams did online to William Cassidy and to others (me, just for example) precisely what they claim he did to her, the case falls apart like a gin-soaked cocktail napkin. "No crime, with no victim;/no jury will convict him." 

And the truth is that these two Kunzang Palyul Choling players at one time or another mocked, stalked, harassed, or insulted every single one my friends on Twitter. Alyce Zeoli is renowned both on- and offline for her tantrums and high handed arrogance, as well as for her belittling response to the merest criticisms; while David Williams is infamous for rude, persistent, laughably obtuse attacks on all who don't fall in line with his Guru's bizarre pronouncements. If William Cassidy deserves to be sitting in a jail in Maryland awaiting trial, then clearly Alyce Zeoli and David Williams deserve to be sitting in jail in Oregon awaiting trial also. Since when does the federal government arbitrarily take sides in Internet flame wars? 

I never saw William Cassidy cyberstalk anybody so I can't pronounce on that subject, but I can say this: Alyce Zeoli and David Williams are cyberstalkers extraordinaire –- and by deliberately misleading the federal government in their wildly successful attempt to put my life in danger and to deprive me of all civil, political and human rights, they’ve downgraded their profile to felonious liars and co-conspiring domestic terrorists. Eventually, one can hope, the federal government will wake up to their vicious act, soon after which cell doors will clang shut on these two smiling, saffron-robed vipers.

Even in so called Hināyāna schools, there is the recognition that the motivation to become a buddha is predicated upon the desire to benefit all sentient beings. 

Texts like the Ugraparipriccha, the Samcayagathas, parts of the Lotus sutra, and so on. Certainly, the Perfection of Wisdom sutras were in their initial form by 100 CE, and probably earlier.

It's most famous exponent, Nāgārjuna, dates to the middle of the 2nd century CE.

If anything, the influence is the other way around.

Not only that, but the cultivation of love and compassion was strongly recommended by the Buddha was a very important practice in all strands of Buddhist schools.

Yes, I have acknowledged this several times. The point I am making is that later Vajrayānists took this limitation seriously and proposed that early Mahāyāna was by definition a slow path, requiring incalculable eons to complete because there were no unique methods in sutrayāna to hasten progress on the path. 

Since Chan, Huayen, and so on do not add any new insights into the nature of reality, nor do they add any revolutionary new methods, any claims they make to sudden buddhahood are merely rhetoric and philosophical trickery.

No, the bhumis are measures of qualities, the paths are measures of realization. This is why the āryan path has only three phases: the path of seeing, the path of cultivation and the path of no more training. The ten bodhisattva stages are included within both the path of seeing (first bhumi) and the path of cultivation (first bhumi to tenth bhumi). The path of no more training is Buddhahood.

Again, this is just philosophical slight of hand, using the teaching of the emptiness of phenomena (shown above) to try and demonstrate that conventional phenomena are not effective borders on nihilism. 

Further, this supposes that practicing dana paramita and realizing dana paramita is sufficient for full buddhahood. It is not. It is sufficient for realizing the first bodhisattva bhumi, and that is all. As I mentioned above, the emptiness realized on the path of seeing and the emptiness that a Buddha realizes is the same emptiness. There is no difference at all in the realization of emptiness of a first stage bodhisattva and a Buddha. But there is a difference in affliction and omniscience. 

You might try and will it away with philosophical sophistries, but this is not the intention of Mahāyāna.

What I find important is that there is a serious discontinuity between the idea of buddhahood promulgated by certain extreme Chan masters and the rest of the Buddhist world. 

You seem to think the argument hinges on sudden verses slow. It does not. It hinges on whether buddhahood is accomplished by virtue of the two things all Mahāyāna sutras say it is accomplished by i.e. the practice of the perfections and the two accumulations. Vajrayāna differs solely from common Mahāyāna of India, in this respect, by virtue of the suggestion that there are means by which one can reduce the amount of time it takes to generate the complete two collections from the daunting three incalculable eons to one, seven or sixteen lifetimes. 

These Chan speculations you have introduced, on the other hand, hinge on philosophical sleights of hand that I have already pointed out. My point is that these philosphical speculations have no precedent in Indian Buddhism. 

Whether one accepts them or not is entirely a matter of personal choice. I don't accept them, since I think they represent a deviation from Indian Buddhism -- I do not believe that there was any person who became a Buddha without gathering the two accumulations in their entirety. 

In the end it is not a question of valid or invalid, it is a question of definitions. For me, a Buddhahood divorced from the two accumulations is impossible.

It's the old mode of appearance as opposed to mode of existence thing. For example, there is a glass of water -- it is perceived differently by beings of the six realms. If we say that the object, a glass of water is only a mental projection, there is no point is proposing that one object is perceived differently by different beings of the six realms. 

Now then, we can dismiss the idea of an objective reality without dismissing the idea of objects per se. 

Longchen rejects that idea that objects are mind because if they were, mountains should disappear when we cease to perceive them. But by the same token, objects, when analyzed, also cannot be found.

No, we just have the usual philosophical sleight of hand I mentioned above. 

The point that I am really trying to make is that Indian Mahāyānists took their own tradition seriously. For example, Nāgārjuna in the Ratnavali lists in some detail how much merit is required for each of the major and minor marks, when encouraging the king to cultivate merit. 

And three uncalculable eons is not even really a Mahāyāna number. It is a number which comes from the earliest ideas about the length of time it took the bodhisattva to acheive buddhahood. 

So on the one hand, we have the Indian tradition (Mahāyāna, Vajrayāna and the śrāvaka traditions) insisting that in order to become a buddha one must practice the paramitas for an insanely long period of time. And on the other hand we have a tradition a tradition in China which asserts all this is so much unnecessary proliferation. 

Saying that "qualities are present in the basis" is a meaningless statement. Butter is present in milk, but it does not come out all by itself, oil is present in sesame seeds but it does not extract itself. And which qualities exactly? 

Of coure what we are dealing with here is a specfies of tathāgatagarbha thinking, but even hear, I don't think that the type of instant buddhahood you see some Chan masters proclaiming can be justified on the basis of any Indian sutras, tathāgatgarbha or otherwise. 

Of course, this is the realm of religion, so no one can prove anything since it all boils down to belief.

But we do count Indian Mahāyāna, since Vajrayāna is an extension of Indian Mahāyāna. 

BTW, no one said it was impossible to become a buddha in this life. The notion is "is buddhahood in a single lifetime" a possibility? In India Mahāyāna, the answere is no-- Indian Mahayāna of whatever stripe requires three incalculable eons at minimumfor full awakening. In Vajrayāna, the answer is yes, since through special methods it is made possible. 

It seems to me that rather than providing methods, certain Chan masters who try to prove full enlightment in the span of a single lifetime, engage in a philosphical feints to support their conception, in general resorting to arguments by means of ultimate truth to try and prove their point, basically arguing the doctrine of paths and stages is an unnecessary conceptual limitation. However, when challenged, I don't see a coherent defense being mounted, which has lead me to believe that much like pure land buddhism, Chan is in fact a faith oriented school.

The difference is that the appearance and the apparent object are different, whereas in the Yogacara school, the apparent object itself is not held to exist apart from the mind, hence the sobriquet, "mind-only".

Well, the reason why they continue to translate it literally is that there is an important explanation connected with tha mal gyi shes pa. In this context tha mal means something like original, or uncontrived, and shes pa means awareness. So it is really talking about being in the experience of the nature of the mind. But you won't get this from book which is why it is important also to have the oral instructions.

Well, this is definitely not so. Sutra studies in Tibetan Buddhism is based primarily, though not exclusively on treatise authored between the 2-6th century. 

WHat is more accurate to say is that China, being an outpost of Buddhism, was in many respects out of the main stream of the development of Mahāyāna theory in India. What is also true, is that Chinese Buddhists tended to ignore Indian sastra literature, and prefer their own interpretations of Buddhist sutras to those of Indian masters. For example, Huayen masters really looked down on Asanga.

Pero is telling you is that the literal translation of tha mal gyis shes pa is "ordinary mind". It is a yogi's term. It means wisdom. So, in translations tha mal gyis shes pa is generally given it's literal rendering; but one is to understand the term through its meaning i.e. wisdom.

Not necessarily. While in Tibetan Buddhism a hard theory of karma is often held out, in Theravada Buddhism it is considered that people can be caught up in negative situations without necessarily having done anything negative to get there. In other words, being in the wrong place at wrong time is possible without it being a karmic thing. 

Being born as a human being is a result of good karma; but not necessarily everything that happends to one is a result of karma, some things are purely a result of blind causes and conditions that have nothing directly to do with one's karma.

Well, this is the problem with sorting out the Dharma for oneself. There is a Dharma teaching for whatever stage of practice one is at. But that is the point, one has to work with where one is at. 

So if you read a text that seems not to address your present state, well, put it aside. And that is a middle way. 

Having a teacher helps, but in the end one must integrate these things into your own practice. 

Rather then looking for a "beginners" Buddhism (since there really isn't such a thing), look for Dharma teachings that speak to you, and work for you in a practical manner. Take what you can absorb and leave the rest. 

In the end, great compassion is the essence of Dharma. Great compassion comes from compassion. Cultivate that, and that is sufficient.

The Dharma, as I understand, begins with understanding our real state and acknowledging it, and not having fantasies about samsara or ourselves. Dharma is not an all or nothing venture. It is progressive, and one only has to practice as much if it as one understands. 

For example, you are not ready to drink the Buddhist koolaid and buy rebirth, karma, and so on hook line and sinker -- you may not even really beleive in awakening. But what you can believe is your own experience, and the painfulness of desire, hatred and ignorance, as well as the joyfulness that connection with other sentient beings can bring.

The Buddha's own advice for people who were not able to adopt his perspectives about rebirth and karma automatically is that they focus their attention on cultivating loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and ultimately, equanimity. 

Once, in response to a statement by Shariputra that friendship was half of the life of a Dharma practitioner, Buddha replied that was incorrect, friendship was the whole of the life of a Dharma practitioner. Thus, cultivating loving kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity are Dharma practice and relationships forged on these bases are deeply fulfilling and satisfying. Not only that, any relationship, positive or negative, one presently is in can be immensely transformed by these four cultivations. Positive relationships are enhanced and deepened, negative relationships will weaken their grasp and one will come to a place of evenness regarding other people's suffering afflictive behavior, an eveness suffused with genuine care for others along with a sharp recognition of one's own limitations around helping others. Equanimity is not indifference, it is recognizing what one is and is not able to accomplish. 

In other words, we don't have to a) fix the world b) be emotional unavailable c) persist in unhealthy relationships -- instead we can slowly work at opening our hearts with love and compassion and work with where we are at the present moment without having to condition it with unattainable idealism. 

Learning calm-abiding or shamatha meditation is very helpful, since this trains us in mental stability. Shamatha creates a container where we are able to see how the mind thrashes, bolts, revolts, jumps around and so on. It gives us a pillar through which to measure the rest of our experience. We do not have to begin with hour long sessions, we can sit for 5 minutes. Then 10. Then 15, and so on. Following the breath is an ideal practice for beginners as well.

Anyway, the main point is that Buddhist practice is not about waking up to some abstract "enlightenment". It is about knowing one's own state, right here and right now and working with that, along with various means to do so. 

In short, understanding our present condition is Dharma practice, and it is the only Dharma practice we have.

No, if this were so then Buddhas would be afflictively attached to sentient beings, and they are not. The afflicitively-attached person owns their afflictions. There is no principle of samsaric co-dependence between Buddhas and sentient beings, which is what you are describing. 

BTW, there is no such a thing as "trying" to be non-afflictively attached. One is either afflicted, not afflicted, or possess patience regarding the arising of one's own afflictions. If one possesses affliction, it is better to recognize that fact and not pretend one is above affliction. 

Afflictions (desire, anger and ignorance) generally only function freely when one is not in possession of recognition of the operation of mental factors driven by affliction and b) when one's mind lacks stability. When one attains patience towards one's the arising of one's afflictions, they arise but lack force that propells one to act upon them. 

In terms of parenting or caring for others, when one is purely under the infleunce of affliction, to some extent that care is blind and filled with self-interest. When one's afflicted relationship is characterized with patience, one is better able to make universal choices affecting all involved without falling under the fog of blind selfish interest. When one is free from affliction, one's caring for others comes from a place of pure altruism and equanimity. 

Pretending that one is free of affliction is bullshit. That is not how afflictive attachment works. A realized bodhisattva possesses non-afflictive attachment towards all sentient beings. A non-realized bodhisattva possesses bias and attachment. If one is not realized, it is better to just recognize one's own state and work with it. 

I.e. if you are attached to your kids, don't pretend not to be, don't pretend you are free from suffering around it, and work with it. Bodhisattvas can work with attachment and desire -- the one thing they cannot work with is anger and hatred. From a Mahāyāna perspective therefore, attachment is workable and it is fine. If you combine your afflicted relationships with altruistic motivation, you can even bring them onto the path, and make them part of your path.

If we, who are not realized, have no way to infer what is correct and incorrect regarding Buddhist doctrine, than we are really screwed, aren't we? 

Citations are not sufficient, of course, one must also use reasoning, and a whole host of other things. 

There is no need to use citations in this respect, it is obvious to anyone who really thinks about it --1) realizing emptiness is not equivalent with becoming a Samyak Sambuddha, 2) realizing emptiness, period, is the emptiness realized by a Buddha. 

The ancient Chan masters are making the argument than the realization of emptiness is sufficient and there is not much reason to place a lot of emphasis on the path of cultivation (bhumis 1-10). Once in possession of the Gnosis of the path, that is the main point, and that is Buddhahood. 

There is a similar sentiment in Kagyu Mahāmudra -- which is why there are so many different presentations of the way four yogas (split into twelve) are mapped to the paths and stages. But in reality, the Mahāyāna paths and stages are irrelvent in Mahamudra, just as they are in Dzogchen. It is not the case however that there is no gradual progression in both mahamudra and dzogchen. The progression is not with respect to the ultimate, but rather, with respect to the person. 

Now then, the question inevitably arises "Is it possible for someone to fully awaken suddenly?" The answer to this question from a Mahamudra, Dzogchen and Chan POV is yes (and from a Vajrayāna POV, one's yogic progress through the stages can be accomplished in a matter of days, theoretically (for example, Saraha was someone who acheived full buddhahood suddenly; Virupa acheived the sixth bhumi in six days)). The caveat to this is that it is so rare as to be merely an academic distinction. In other words, sudden awakeners are possible, but rarer than visible stars at noon. 

The inexpressible realization of emptiness is the same in every respect from the moment of the path of seeing until full buddhahood. We can talk about afflcitive obscurations and knowledge obscurations and so on, but the real difference between buddhas and bodhisattvas on the stages is whether there is a difference in equipoise and post-equipoise. Buddhas are never not in a state of equipoise. Thus the notion of the two obscurations apply only in post-equipoise, not while in eqiupoise on the ultimate. However, this crucial difference is responsible also for the difference in qualities of a buddha and for example, a tenth stager. 

Thus, it is important to distinguish rhetoric from reality so that people do not waste their time on fantasies. And it is indeed a fantasy for 99.999 percent of people that they will be able to suddenly awaken into full Buddhahood.

One needs to make a distinction between afflictive attachment and non-afflictive attachment. Non-afflictive attachment comes from a place of concern and caring, valuing others more than oneself. Afflictive attachment is all about "I, me and mine".

From a Mahāyāna perspective, non-afflictive attachment is perfectly appropriate, indeed necessary. Afflictive attachment is just another cause of suffering.

Frankly, it is obvious that realizing the nature of the mind does not make one a buddha.

They reflect regional seperation, but not separation of difference in aspiration and intention. The vinayas of India are more similar than they are different from one another. The primary differences between them are in the number of minor rules, the cut and color of the robes, and the regional language of the school. 

Bodhisattva vow systems on the other hand are quite different in terms of aspiration and intention. The Brahmajala system in China is clearly in keeping with the Yogachara model, rather than the Madhyamaka model (which is based on the Akashagarbha Sutra).

I don't think you can really argue for a huge difference between Central Asian Buddhism (define were, first of all) and Indian Buddhism because of the strong Influence of Indian culture from Bactria all the way to Java and Modern Day Vietnam.

I would still think that they were not bhikṣus, nor even śramaṇeras, just lay people with shaved heads in robes. 

The Indian approach to these things was always layered. Whereas, the Chinese, cut off from the Mainstream of Indian Buddhism for the most part developed along lines very difficult for Indo-Tibetan Buddhists to recognize. For example, the Chinese obsession with elaborating individual sutra systems and so on. As you know, Indians, in the end, relied more on sastras than the raw material of sutras. Sutras were for devotion, sashtras were for study.

I think this goes a little too far. He told Ananda that it was ok to ignore minor rules without speifying which rules were minor. One assumes he meant rules like making rude noises while chewing, slurping one's soup and so on. 

But he certainly never said "If need be, revise Vinaya." 

Now, given that that are different ceremonies for conferring Vinaya, and different procedures for confession and so on, obviously the Buddha left much up to regional vinayadharas discretion. 

But I do not think one can infer from this that innovations like Saicho's would be considered wise or valid.
