No, mind cannot conceived without duality, because, relatively speaking, without an object and a sense organ, there will be no sense consciousness. Unless one wishes to asserted that all phenomena are "mind-only," one must accept this dualistic state affairs.

Umm, is one ever without the skandhas? Is there such a thing as a sentient beings that has no skandhas? 

Even the Buddha had skandhas. So according to your logic, the Buddha was hopelessly caught in dualism.

The Buddha taught very clearly that freedom from existence and nonexistence, from proliferation of extremes, was his teaching of dependent origination. There really isn't any other kind of absence of duality in the Dharma.

Not especially Kagyu, this is common in all schools. The inner body gives rise to external appearances because there is a correlation between them. For example, it is held that bardo beings, pretas, hell beings, and devas do not see the sun or the moon because they lack the red and white bodhicittas since they are apparitionally born.

Which skandha does "nondual awareness" belong to? "Self and other" is a knowledge obscuration, which even tenth stage bodhisattvas have.

Freedom from extremes means being free from reified notion of existence and nonexistence due to not understanding dependent origination. It does not mean rooting around like a dog or a pig in the garbage.

Conceptualization is the natural function of the mind. The mind conceptualizes automatically. As long as one is breathing, one is conceptualizing. Whether one is resting the mind or not, the mind goes right on conceptualizing. "Resting the mind" does not mean "rest in a concept-free state." Because people think it does, they incorrectly meditate, resulting in birth as animals or unconscious devas.

Some people have this idea that “resting in a nonconceptual state” means a state of absence of thoughts. But this is a very incorrect idea. The mind is always with concepts. It’s function is thinking. Since there can be no awareness in absence of a mind, it is clear that “resting in a nonconceptual state” does not mean being in a state with no conceptual activity. It means resting in state where one is not dominated by conceptual activity. It’s not possible to stop conceptual activity. Go ahead, try. Get back to me on that.

These two kinds of bodhicitta are common Mahayana teachings. Relative bodhicitta in Vajrayana specifically refers to bindu, the yoga of which cause the realization of ultimate bodhicitta. 

The rousing of bodhicitta is always a mind free of affliction, like a lotus that grows from muck, even in an afflicted person. How one rouses it is less of an issue than rousing it. Also, rousing bodhicitta in this life is taken as proof one has done so before. Unlike other vows, which expire at death, bodhicitta vows are only taken once. The afflicted state of an individual is of no consequence at all with respect to rousing of the two bodhicittas. After all, Shakyamuni Buddha first roused bodhicitta in hell.

Incense should be medicinally formulated. Its not just something to make your place smell better. There is a long ayurvedic tradition of inhaling smoke for lung health, etc. The origin of most incense in Buddhadharma derives from this tradition.

The only way to protect Dharma is to practice Dharma. 

If panhandlers in Buddhist robes were really a threat to the Dharma, the Dharma would have vanished more than 2000 years ago. There are have been imposter monks for as long as there has been a real Buddhist sangha. 

No, far more dangerous to the Dharma than beggars wearing religious clothes panhandling in the streets are corrupt bhikṣus, whose only discipline is wearing robes without maintaining the vows they represent, while they collect money from naive devotees for their various monastery projects.

Ordinary light is a product of either combustion or chemical reaction (fire flies), etc.

When we practice a deity, we imagine that it is in the form of light, but this light is the light of consciousness. We use visualizations to manipulate our physical body to produce various results, to experience various kinds of bliss, overcome illnesses, and so on. Sentient beings are composed of six things: earth, water, fire, air, space, and consciousness. Apart from these six dhātus, there is nothing else out of which sentient being is formed. It's pretty simple. 

When one becomes accustomed the Buddhist view of the elements as well as the formation of the body, then much speculation vanishes.

If someone holds that there are no physical correlates to nāḍīs, vāyus, and bindus, then they must admit such visualizations are entirely imaginary and have no basis in conventional reality and no effect on the body. 

Not only does such an assertion harm the basis of Vajrayāna teachings in general, it harms Dzogchen teachings as well. People who maintain such a view and call their practice "mahāmudra" or "atiyoga" are just practicing sutrayāna śamatha and vipaśayanā, which of course have no profound methods connected with the body. It is a farce to then discuss the harm to the body maṇḍala which may be entailed by surgery, suicide, and so on, since such a maṇḍala will also be just an imaginary conceptual construct. 

Certainly someone might decide that this presentation of the universe is medieval, does not correspond with scientific materialism and so on. That's perfectly fine. But then it does not make much sense for them to engage in the creation stage and completion stage, ganacakras to please imaginary ḍākinīs, torma offerings to imaginary dharmapālas, and so on, nor to engage in the practice of caṇḍḹī yoga, karmamudra, and so on, much less trekcho and thogal.

However, if you practice sincerely, and develop your positive qualities, you will likely attract a suitable partner with whom you can share the Dharma. Otherwise, frankly, as far as I am concerned, it is better to be alone than be with someone who does not practice the dharma, or at least have sincere faith in the dharma.

There are only six dhātus in the realm of buddhadharma, earth, air, fire, water, space, and consciousness. Anything that is not consciousness or space is matter. And in some tantric systems (Kālacakra specifically), even space is composed of matter. 

The body is composed of refined matter, which is processed out of the food that we eat. 

It is impossible to understand these systems of yoga without understanding the medical perspective of the human body that was held by the authors of the tantras, etc. People who ignore this just wind up creating a strange goulash of their own fabrications, not grounded in any text, based on whatever opinion  of day they are holding, as we see here.

Yes, in fact we do. And those channels are very explicitly described, in detail, in the commentaries, as physical entities subject to growth, persistence, and decay. After 26 years of age, the 72000 nāḍīs decay at a regular rate. 

The nāḍīs are held to be passageways. Passageways for what? Bindus, red bindus, white bindus, etc, which are moved around by vāyu (which just means air in Sanskrit). What do these bindus come from? Sixteen bindus come from our parents, eight red, and eight white. The rest comes from the food that we eat. Where do the five vāyus come from? The air we breath. 

When we practice completion stage practices, as I said before, we visualize these channels as made of light, in bodies that we visualize as made of light. However, the bindus that are contained within them are physical, no? I mean, otherwise, what is it in karmamudra that one is retaining, reversing, spreading, and distributing uniformly? Light? What is the bliss in the body one is feeling? Merely visualized bliss or is it physical bliss?

All these functions are governed in general by the air element, which manifests in our experience as the motile quality of matter. 

What has happened is that new age ideas about prāṇa have so infected our thinking, when we look at Buddhist texts, there are all these cobwebs we have ti peel from our eyes.

 In his commentary on the medicine tantras, Desi points out that the avadhuti, for example, is physical, but can only be identified in living bodies. 

In the dgongs pa zang thal, an outer, inner, and secret avadhuti is discussed. The outer is the spinal cord, specifically identified as such, the inner is the aorta, spefically identified as such, and the secret one is the very fine channel that Desi discusses. 

The descriptions of these things in the body are too precise and specific for them not to be physical structures in the body.

Not a gloss. The two obscurations are something to be purified in Vajrayāna. That does not mean they substantially exist. For example, Śākyamitra's Mahāmudrāyogāvatārapiṇḍārtha it states, "After migrating beings complete the accumulation of merit, they completely abandon the great mass of the two obscurations." Or Ratnarakṣita's commentary on the Laghusamvara, which states, "Gradually abandoning the two obscurations and accomplishing mahamudra to serve all migrating beings is the stated purpose."་ Even Tilopa states in his Mahāmudropadeśa:

For example, though darkness accumulates for a thousand eons,
the mass of darkness is dispelled by a single lamp;
likewise, a moment of the luminosity of one's mind
will dispel all misdeeds and obscurations gathered for an eon.

So, while one can certainly argue over method, one cannot argue that in order to attain buddhahood, one must abandon or remove the two obscurations.

Naropa, in his Sekkodeṣa commentary on the empowerments of Kālacakra, also discusses the need to abandon the two obscurations. In fact, he discusses four obscurations there, the usual two, plus obscurations of māra and samapatti. 

Frankly, you are just not going to find Indian masters who negate the necessity of abandoning the two obscurations and gathering the two accumulations. Even in the Dzogchen tradition, this is necessary, as Khenpo Ngachung points out. The means may be different but the necessity is still there.

The formation of all channels in the body are described in the tantras as being governed by the five elements. How could this be possible if the channels and elements in the channels (vāyu, bindu) are some woo woo form of ill-defined "energy"?

The way you visualize the vajra body does not correspond to how it physically exists in your body, just as the way you visualize yourself as a deity, sans viscera, does not correspond to how your body actually exists. 

There is no such thing as "energy." There are five elements, that is all. Vāyu is just the element of air that exists inside the body. If the vajra body is not physical, there would be no way it could cause pain, or in the case of the eyes, for example, be damaged by over exposure to light sources, etc. In fact, it  could not be damaged at all by anything, including surgery.

Dzogchen is Dzogchen, as they say gcig shes kun grol, knowing one liberates all. In this case, many lamas who have not mastered thogal beyond the second vision (and most lamas have not) nevertheless give Dzogchen empowerments and teachings. And, if you understand and have experience in Dzogchen, one does not need to "master" all these cycles to teach them (providing you have received them), since the basic points of Dzogchen man ngag sde are identical in every system. The main difference will be whatever yidams are associated with this or that cycle as supports. For example, ChNN freely picked and chose from what he considered the best from older termas, and presented them in that way, not bothering to or even thinking it necessary to give the entire cycle from which this or that Dzogchen instruction was drawn. At base, Nyinthig Dzogchen practice is summed up in four points: mind-training, rushan, trekcho, and thogal. The rest of it is ancillary. For example, to practice Yeshe Lama, all you really need is the empowerment of Thigle Gyacan, and the lung and rig pa'i rtsal wang of Ye shes lama. You don't need the entire Longchen Nyinthig. Just the Dzogchen portion.

The point is that there is a point on which all Mahayana schools agree: in order to attain buddhahood, one has to eradicate all taints. If one does not do this, even if one's practice is impartial compassion which benefits sentient beings, even if one's wisdom is that of a tenth stage bodhisattva, it is still contaminated, so not the highest.

Your time frame is too short. Think about all the nonvirtue we have engaged in since beginningless time. But even the force of all of that cannot prevent someone from being born in Sukhavati if at the time of their death they focus single-heartedly on Amitābha Buddha. There are various ways to parse how the Pure Land Sūtra are supposed to be read, but recall, even Angulimāla, after murdering 999 people, attained arhatship. And his sūtra is one of the main tathāgatagarbha sūtras. There is considerable precedent for the idea that one's conduct in life is not necessarily a negative, determining factor in whether one can take birth in the pure lands.

For example, when Mahāsiddha Virūpa (8th-9th century) was in South India, having been recruited as by a Hindu King for his expertise in Sanskrit, he was busted for prostrating to a copy of the Aṣṭasāhasrikā rather than a Śiva linga. One can well imagine that taking this sūtra as an object of devotion was extremely common, particularly among the educated, Buddhist elites. It's my personal favorite, along with the Saṃcayagathas.

When people cast doubt on vaccines, they increase vaccine hesitancy. When vaccine hesitancy increases, more unvaccinated people become infected, and increase the possibility of mutations. At base it comes down to public health vs. personal health. The idea that people have a right to not take vaccines (barring a demonstrable threat to their health that overrides the public interest) has already been settled by the supreme court in the USA in the 1905 Jacobson v. Massachusetts decision:

 “The good and welfare of the Commonwealth, of which the legislature is primarily the judge, is the basis on which the police power rests in Massachusetts,” Harlan said  “upon the principle of self-defense, of paramount necessity, a community has the right to protect itself against an epidemic of disease which threatens the safety of its members.”

The issue of compulsory vaccinations for attendance of school was settled in 1922, Zucht v. King.

This is not the case. When, during the Buddha's day, monks committed civil crimes, they were turned over the civil authorities.

Therefore we have to get along with other people who are not Buddhists. This means we have to accommodate and adjust to the presence of governments, media, tech, large corporations.

Cells are also composed of parts, there is nothing in the universe that is not composed of parts. So when those things are examined, they are found to empty. Empty does not mean "unreal," per se. It means empty of independent, aka inherent, existence. But things are also empty of dependent existence as well, since that is merely another form of inherent existence. Things are dependently originated, and thus they are empty and dependently designated. This is the middle way.

The Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom
In Sanskrit: Bhagavati prajnaparamitahrdaya
In Tibetan: Bcom Idan 'das ma shes rab kyi pha rol tu phyin pa'I snying po
In English: The Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom, the Bhagavati

Thus have I once heard:

The Blessed One was staying in Rajagrha at Vulture Peak along with a great community of monks and great community of bodhisattvas, and at that time, the Blessed One fully entered the meditative concentration on the varieties of phenomena called the Appearance of the Profound. At that very time as well, holy Avalokitsevara, the bodhisattva, the great being, beheld the practice itself of the profound perfection of wisdom, and he even saw the five aggregates as empty of inherent nature. Thereupon, through the Buddha's inspiration, the venerable Sariputra spoke to holy Avalokitsevara, the bodhisattva, the great being, and said, "Any noble son who wishes to engage in the practice of the profound perfection of wisdom should train in what way?"

When this had been said, holy Avalokitsevara, the bodhisattva, the great being, spoke to venerable Sariputra and said, "Sariputra, any noble sons or daughters who wish to practice the perfection of wisdom should see this way: they should see insightfully, correctly, and repeatedly that even the five aggregates are empty of inherent nature. Form is empty, emptiness is form, Emptiness is not other than form, form is also not other than emptiness. Likewise, sensation, discrimination, conditioning, and awareness are empty. In this way, Sariputra, all things are emptiness; they are without defining characteristics; they are not born, they do not cease, they are not defiled, they are not undefiled. They have no increase, they have no decrease.

"Therefore, Sariputra, in emptiness there is no form, no sensation, no discrimination, no conditioning, and no awareness. There is no eye, no ear, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind. There is no form, no sound, no smell, no taste, no texture, no phenomenon. There is no eye-element and so on up to no mind-element and also up to no element of mental awareness. There is no ignorance and no elimination of ignorance and so on up to no aging and death and no elimination of aging and death. Likewise, there is no suffering, origin, cessation, or path; there is no wisdom, no attainment, and even no non-attainment.

"Therefore, Sariputra, since the bodhisattvas have no obtainments, they abide relying on the perfection of wisdom. Having no defilements in their minds, they have no fear, and passing completely beyond error, they reach nirvana. Likewise, all the Buddhas abiding in the three times clearly and completely awaken to unexcelled, authentic, and complete awakening in dependence upon the perfection of wisdom.

"Therefore, one should know that the mantra of the perfection of wisdom - the mantra of great knowledge, the precious mantra, the unexcelled mantra, the mantra equal to the unequalled, the mantra that quells all suffering - is true because it is not deceptive. The mantra of the perfection of wisdom is proclaimed:

tadyatha - gate gate paragate parasamgate bodhi svaha!

Sariputra, a bodhisattva, a great being, should train in the profound perfection of wisdom in that way."

Thereupon, the Blessed One arose for that meditative concentration, and he commended holy Avalokitsevara, the bodhisattva, the great being. "Excellent!" he said. "Excellent! Excellent! Noble child, it is just so. Noble child, it is just so. One should practice the profound perfection of wisdom in the manner that you have revealed - the Tathagatas rejoice!" This is what the Blessed One said.

Thereupon, the venerable Sariputra, the holy Avalokitsevara, the bodhisattva, the great being, and that entire assembly along with the world of gods, humans, asuras, and gandharvas, all rejoiced and highly praised what the Blessed One had said.

For years I have observed many people here waxing nostalgic about Dharma kings. This fantasy is deeply embedded in the Tibetan Buddhist imagination, even in westerners. 

For example, such images permeate the lower initiations of Vajrayāna, superficially modeled on the coronation of an Indian monarch. Trungpa borrowed various customs from Asian countries, combined them with his imagination of British mannerisms, cooked this all up into a new dish, and served monarchism to western disciples. We still have people who take the Kālacakra empowerment stirred by utopian fantasies of a coming world paradise run by tenth-stage bodhisattva rulers, hoping to be reborn as soldiers in the army of Rudra Cakravartin. And of course we have famous Tibetan Buddhist teachers today who complain bitterly about Democracy on a regular basis. 

And more to the point, virtually all of our lineage heads were religious rulers. 

Of course, this sentiment is understandable in societies like Tibet, and basically everywhere else, which were run by despots, tyrants, and warlords. But such imagery, though evocative, is much less powerful in a Democratic society

Washington was a founder. I was responding to a specific claim about Washington, i.e., that people feared HE would want to become a king. Washington was no prince, he singly handedly started the war that ultimately led to the American Revolution, the French and Indian War of 1754-1763, and he owned slaves. My point was that no one feared that Washington had royal ambitions, despite a robust conversation about the undesirability of having a king at the head of the new republic.

From our perspective, a buddha intended it. And it really depends on how much one thinks "Buddhism" is only the recorded words of a particular human being who lived in India roughly 2500 years ago. 

But more to the point, we cannot expect our legends and myths to correspond to an empirical examination of facts in modern history, archaeology, and text criticism. And frankly, when it comes to practicing our traditions, we shouldn't really care. Empirical facts are part of impure vision, not the experiential vision of yogins and yoginis.

Well, practice five-fold Mahāmudra or Vajrayoginī in the Drigung system and find out. 

I suspect these claims of effectiveness are a kind of puffery. Their validity rests on accepting certain assumptions. 

The Laghusamvara system was certainly the most widely practiced tantric cycle in India. It has the most explanatory tantras, commentaries, and sādhanas. More of the Eighty-Four Mahāsiddhas practiced it than any other system. Today, it remains the most widely practice system in Tibetan Buddhism, extensively practiced in Sakya, Kagyu, and Gelug, with the central lineages in all three schools descending directly from Naropa, either through Mal Lotsawa Rinchen Drak (Sakya, Geluk) or Marpa Lotsawa (Dwagpo Kagyu, Geluk), and is practiced more widely than Hevajra, Guhyasamāja, Kālacakra, not to mention more obscure systems like Caturpitha, Mahāmaya, Candamahārośana, Buddhakāpala, and so on.

But more importantly, for Indians, the origin story of Heruka of the Laghusamvara has everything to do with the conquest of Shiva and Umadevi, sited in and around places in India that people actually travelled to and at one point, could identify with certainty. Later, when these pithas, upithas, and so on became less identifiable, the pilgrimage became an inner one, with the Ghantapāda body mandala system, etc. 

None of these claims can be verified in any sort of objective way for anyone but oneself.

Why? "Matter is empty, emptiness is matter; apart from matter there is no emptiness; apart from emptiness there is no matter, the same for sensation. perception, formation, and consciousness."

No one considers dramatizations to be lies. For example, Plato’s Socrates was based on a real person, but was used as a literary device to express Plato’s ideas. In other words, Plato always put the best argument in the mouth of Socrates, but there is little doubt that these words were rarely if ever the actual words of Socrates. Likewise, Mahayana arose at the same time as the Ramayana and so on, use similar themes, etc. Is the Ramayana or the Bhagavad Gita a lie? Did Ravanna conspire to steal Sita? Was there ever even a person named Ravanna or Sita?  If there was never a person named Ravanna, then what does that do to the credibility of the Lanka in your view? 

Or what about the fact that the Blazing Tongue of the Dakini tantra, the principle source on the origins of Mahakala and Mahakali, borrows the narrative of Shiva destroying Tripura in order to explain the origins of Mahakala and borrows the narrative of Ravanna  seducing Sita to explain the origins of Shri Devi and Remati? Is this a lie, or is there something else to be considered in these examples?

You seem to be making the claim that if the Mahayana sutras and tantras do not portray actual historical events, if tales of the lineage like Buddha flying to Oddiyana to meet Indrabhuti I, or giving the Kalacakra inside a stupa in South India, are dramatic stories rather than historical events, it’s all a bust.

Do you believe the Buddha flew through the air to Śṛī Lanka to have a buddy to buddy conversation with rakṣasa king, Ravana, as the Lankāvatāra portrays? Do you literally believe thousands of monks and bodhisattvas can fit on Rajagriha? 

More to the point, does it actually matter if these things happened in history, or is the content and message of these texts more important? 

If you decided that these events did not happen in history, that they were a kind of religious fictional narrative, would you lose confidence in Mahāyāna teachings? And if you did lose confidence in Mahāyāna teachings, wouldn't that mean the provenance of a teaching is more important to you than its doctrine? 

When it comes to history, I read historians; when it comes to tenets, I read panditas; when it comes to the meaning of sūtras, I read the charioteers, Nāgārjuna, and the rest; when it comes to Vajrayāna, I read the mahāsiddhas, like Virupa, Indrabhuti, etc. I am perfectly comfortable adapting my perspective based on what is useful in that moment.

While there are certainly texts in the Tenjur that define "yoga" in line with the idea of joining two things together, such as uniting method and wisdom, we also find definitions such as the one is a commentary on the Fifty Verses of Guru Devotion, "Yoga is a samadhi that transcends the world." Likewise, in the Yoga Sutras, we find the line, "Yoga is the cessation of transformations of the mind." Of course the philosophical base of the two traditions is not the same: the former being rooted in Madhyamaka, the latter in Saṃkhya, but the definitions are more or less the same. 

Given that there is no way to derive joining two things from "rnal 'byor" at all, one assumes that the idea of the Indian panditas of eighth century who assisted Tibetan translators was more oriented towards the resting in the natural state idea.

There was no writing in India, as far as we know, prior to the Mauryan Empire.

Speaking of Indian cultural habits, putting words in the mouths of historical, legendary, and mythical figures seems to be very much their habit. Somewhat like the way we write historical dramas with dialogue that John Adams, for example, never spoke in actuality.

Rnal’byor in no way means joining two things together. This is consistent with Ramasvami’s contention, where he is discussing Patanjali’ Yoga Sutras. 

In other places he agrees that the word yoga can mean jointing two things together, for example Bhakti yoga, etc. but the term “yoga,” as it was understood by Tibetans, under advisement from their pandita informants, meant “resting in the natural state.”

That depends on how it is etymologized. For example, Srivasta Ramaswami, my guru of yoga, explains  this word is often mistranslated by yoga scholars. We commonly hear that yoga means 'to yoke', from the Sanskrit word 'yuj'. But it is actually a derivative of the word 'yuja' which means 'peace of mind', or 'samadhi', which is the 8th limb of yoga.

Likewise, Tibetan, the early translators translated the term yoga as rnal 'byor. Rnal is from "rnal ma," which means perfect, true, and actual, and here, fundamental. 

"byor here means to settle. So in this context, yoga means "to settle into one's authentic fundamental condition."

You should check out Bronkhorst's historical work. 

The original system among Indo-Europeans was based on three main classes: priests, warriors, and farmers. The four class system was a later development, unique to India. Also, there was great fluidity between these three classes, meaning one could be all three. The main point is that Buddha's folks interred their important people in Kurgans. The Brahmins thought this was barbaric, and in early texts, referred to the people who lived in Magadha as demons, not even human. 

The Scythians, unlike their Iranian cousins, did not do homa offerings. Also, the warrior class was considered the foremost class, with priests and farmers, second and third. We see this in the Buddha's teachings in the Pali canon as well. After the Sakas invaded India in 145 BCE, after they gained power in Gandhara, they strongly supported Buddhism, and continued to enjoy power even after they were made vassals of the Kushana Empire. But there were likely Scythians in the army of Ashoka's father, Chandragupta Maurya. One presumes they were well-acquainted with the ill-fated Śākya tribe that was decimated by Kosalians during the Buddha's lifetime. 

Scholars such as Beckwith and Witzel make very convincing arguments that the Śākyas in Magadha are in fact Indo-Scythians from an earlier migration. 

Highland Scots, incidentally, claim to be descendants of the Scythians.

Yes, indeed he did. However, we can see in later literature a sort of brahminization of Buddhism, to the point where even creatures like nāgas are divided into four varnas, and so on, and brahmins being part of the deal in terms of royal rites in Thailand, and so on. So we tend to think of the Buddha as being a kṣatriya, when it fact it is unlikely that Buddha was part of the varna system at all, and thus such appellations are irrelevant to his actual social status. In other words, legend has it that Buddha left his royal heritage behind him. But as the chiefs of the Śākyas were elected, it is unlikely he had the obligation of being a royal heir, hence not a prince. In other words, later legends about the person of the Buddha are to him as Arthurian romances are to the original Arthur.

It is quite questionable whether the Buddha's tribe was actually part of the caste system. For example, his father, "the king," was an elected chief, and there was no hereditary kingship in the Buddha's tribe. So his being a "prince" is a western affectation that does not even begin to address his actual position in the Śākya tribe. The brahmins were simply not that present in Greater Maghada, and there is evidence that the brahamins to the west seriously looked down upon these primitives who buried their chiefs in burial mounds. While it is certainly improbably that kings of Tibet descended from Mountain Licchavis, what is true is that Tibetans adopted Iranian-Scythian custom of interring their btsan pos, chiefs, in burial mounds as well.

Definition of grace (Entry 1 of 2)
1a : unmerited divine assistance given to humans for their regeneration or sanctification

Now, I agree with both you and Zhen Li that "grace" is not an appropriate word to use in Buddhadharma, on the other hand, you can forgive people for seeing what is referred to as the "primal vow" as a form fo grace: "unmerited divine assistance given to humans for their regeneration or sanctification." And I guarantee you, despite your misgivings, many Westerners are inclined to see such concepts in light of "grace," just as many people confuse the Tibetan "byin rlabs (adhiṣṭhāna)", i.e., "conferred or transformed  through power," aka blessings, for something like grace.

The chariot can not be found in any of its parts, one of its parts or separate from its parts, therefore, there is no "chariot" at all, apart from an imputation, "chariot," upon an assembly of parts. The part you are missing is functionality. In order for a thing to be accepted as conventionally existent, prior to analysis, it must perform its imputed function successfully. Upon analysis, even if a given thing properly performs its function, it cannot be found in the collection of its parts, even though it still continues to function.

One may think: “We concede that our decisions are unreliable, but when we follow the decisions of the Buddha, we are infallible.” Then who decided that the Buddha is infallible? If you say, “The great scholars and adepts like Nagarjuna decided that he is infallible,” then who decided that Nagarjuna is infallible? If you say, “The Foremost Lama Tsong khapa decided it,” then who knows that the Foremost Lama is infallible? If you say, “Our kind and peerless lama, the excellent and great so and so decided,” then infallibility, which depends on your excellent lama, is decided by your own mind. In fact, therefore, it is a tiger who vouches for a lion, it is a yak who vouches for a tiger, it is a dog who vouches for a yak, it is a mouse who vouches for a dog, it is an insect who vouches for a mouse. Thus, an insect is made the final voucher for them all. Therefore, when one analyzes in detail the final basis for any decision, apart from coming back to one’s own mind, nothing else whatsoever is perceived.

The idea that someone can authorize someone else to teach Dharma is just institutional politics. The Buddha refused to appoint an heir. People forget that in their quest for external legitimization.

You are just making it worse, for example here the MPN delivers this sexist trope just before the passage we have been discussing: 

།རིགས་ཀྱི་བུ། གཞན་ཡང་རིགས་ཀྱི་བུའམ། རིགས་ཀྱི་བུ་མོས་སྐྱེས་པའི་རང་བཞིན་དུ་འགྱུར་བར་བསྒོམ་པར་བྱའོ༑ ༑ཅིའི་ཕྱིར་ཞེ་ན། བུད་མེད་ཀྱི་རང་བཞིན་ནི། ཆོས་མ་ཡིན་པ་ཐམས་ཅད་ཀྱི་རྒྱུའི་སྒོ་ནས་འབྱུང་ཁུངས་ཡིན་ཏེ། དཔེར་བྱ་ན། སྦྲང་བུའི་གཅིན་གྱིས་ནི། ནམ་ཡང་ས་ཆེན་པོ་བརླན་པར་ཡང་མི་འགྱུར། ངོམས་པར་ཡང་མི་འགྱུར་བ་དེ་བཞིན་དུ་བུད་མེད་ཀྱང་ནམ་ཡང་འདོད་པས་ངོམས་པར་མི་འགྱུར་ཏེ...[Toh. 120, vol. 54, f. 137a]

Sons of good families, and also daughters of good families, should cultivate the nature [rang bzhin, prakṛti] of a male. Why? The nature of women is the source through which all adharma [chos ma yin] is caused.For example, a single bee can never moisten the entire ground, and also can never be satisfied. Likewise, a woman's desire can never be satisfied...[more explication of the example]

The Tibetan translation from Chinese is very little different:

།རིགས་ཀྱི་བུ། གཞན་ཡང་རིགས་ཀྱི་བུ་དང༌། རིགས་ཀྱི་བུ་མོ་ལ་སོགས་པ་གང་ཡང་སྐྱེས་པའི་ལུས་མི་འདོད་པ་མེད་དོ། །དེ་ཅིའི་ཕྱིར་ཞེན། བུད་མེད་ཐམས་ཅད་ནི་སྡིག་པ་ཐམས་ཅད་ཀྱི་གནས་ཡིན་པའི་ཕྱིར་རོ། །རིགས་ཀྱི་བུ། གཞན་ཡང་འདི་ལྟ་སྟེ། དཔེར་ན༑ སྦྲང་བུའི་གཅིན་གྱིས་ནི་ས་ཆེན་པོ་འདི་རླན་པར་མི་ནུས་སོ། །བུད་མེད་ཅེས་བྱ་བའི་འདོད་ཆགས་ཆོག་མི་ཤེས་པའང་དེ་དང་འདྲ་སྟེ...[Toh. 119, vol. 52, f. 152b—153a]

Further, sons and daughters of good families should never not desire the body [lus] of a man. Why? All women are the source of all wickedness [sdig pa]. Son of a good family, further, it as follows: A single bee cannot moisten the entire ground, likewise, a woman is never satisfied by desire...

It is immediately after this example that we get to the passage that we have been discussing:

།རིགས་ཀྱི་བུ། དེ་བས་ན། ཡོངས་སུ་མྱ་ངན་ལས་འདས་པ་ཆེན་པོ་འདི་ཐོས་ནས་བུད་མེད་ཀྱི་རང་བཞིན་ལ་མ་ཆགས་པའི་སེམས་བསྐྱེད་པར་བྱ་སྟེ། སྐྱེས་པའི་རང་བཞིན་དུ་འགྱུར་བར་སེམས་བསྐྱེད་པར་བྱའོ། །ཅིའི་ཕྱིར་ཞེ་ན། མདོ་འདི་ནི། སྐྱེས་པའི་རང་བཞིན་དེ་གཤེགས་པའི་སྙིང་པོ་ཡང་དག་པར་སྟོན་པའི་ཕྱིར་རོ། །སྐྱེས་པའི་རང་བཞིན་ནི། མི་ཞེས་བྱའོ། །དེ་བཞིན་གཤེགས་པའི་རང་བཞིན་ནི། སྐྱེས་པའོ། །འཇིག་རྟེན་ན་སྐྱེས་པ་ཡོད་པ་གང་ཡིན་པ་དེ་དག་ཀྱང་བདག་ཉིད་ལ་དེ་བཞིན་གཤེགས་པའི་སྙིང་པོ་ཡོད་པར་མི་ཤེས་པའི་ཕྱིར་སྐྱེས་པའི་རང་བཞིན་མ་ཡིན་ནོ། །དེ་བཞིན་གཤེགས་པའི་སྙིང་པོ་མི་ཤེས་པ་གང་ཡིན་པ་དེ་དག་ནི། བུད་མེད་ཡིན་ནོ། །ཞེས་ང་ཟེར་རོ། །དེ་བཞིན་གཤེགས་པའི་སྙིང་པོ་བདག་ལ་ཡོད་དོ་སྙམ་དུ་ཡང་དག་པར་ཤེས་པ་གང་ཡིན་པ་དེ་དག་ནི། སྐྱེས་པའི་མཆོག་ཏུ་གཏོགས་ཏེ། བུད་མེད་ཡིན་དུ་ཟིན་ཀྱང་སྐྱེས་པའི་མཆོག་ཏུ་གཏོགས་སོ། །དེ་ལྟར་ན། ཡོངས་སུ་མྱ་ངན་ལས་འདས་པ་ཆེན་པོའི་མདོ་ཆེན་པོ་འདི་ནི་དེ་བཞིན་གཤེགས་པའི་སྙིང་པོ་སྟོན་པའི་ཕྱིར་དཔག་ཏུ་མེད་པ་ཡིན་ནོ། [Toh. 120, vol. 54, f. 137b]

Son of a good family, therefore, having heard this Mahāparinirvāṇa, one should generate the thought to never be attached to the nature of a woman. One should generate the thought to become the nature of a man. Why? Because this sūtra correctly explicates the male nature to be tathāgatagarbha [de bzhin gshegs pa'i snying po]. The male nature is called "man." The nature of the tathāgatagarbha is male. Where ever there are men in the world who do not know that the tathāgatagarbha exists in themselves, they lack the male nature. I call those who do not know tathāgatagarbha "women." Those who correctly know and think "Tathāgatagarbha exists in me," are the supreme among men, even such women who grasp this are included in the supreme among men. In this case, this great Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra is inestimable because it explicates tathāgatagarbha.

It is virtually impossible to sustain an argument that this passage is not predicated upon sexist attitudes towards women. Indeed, the composer of the sūtra sets up the entire passage by describing women as insatiable, and the source of all Adharma. It is not like passages written for bhikṣus that describe the perils of the female form, which are to be reversed by bhikṣunīs. It is clearly stating FEMALE BODIES are inherently WICKED as opposed to MALE BODIES that are inherently VIRTUOUS. You just don't get much more sexist than that. 

And there is the passage in the beginning where the upāsikās mentally denigrate their female bodies as wicked (བུད་མེད་ཀྱི་ལུས་ངན་ནོ་སྙམ་དུ་སྨོད་པ་ [Toh. 120 vol. 54, f. 7b]). Then there is the stock passage which declares a tathāgata only takes a male body, but displays both male and female bodies to tame sentient beings (དེ་བཞིན་གཤེགས་པ་ནི་རྟག་ཏུ་སྐྱེས་པ་ཁོ་ན་ཡིན་བཞིན་དུ་སེམས་ཅན་རྣམས་གདུལ་བའི་ཕྱིར་གཉི་གར་ཡང་སྟོན་ཏོ [Toh. 120, vol 54, f. 63b]), etc.

Now, of course I understand why you wish to maintain some sort of interpretive scheme to save the words of the text from clearly saying what they say. There is the passage where the Buddha explains his use of exaggeration with the word "all" with the following verse:

[1]All rivers wind through valleys,
all women are deceitful,
all groves are wooded,
and all lords are happy. [/i]

Naturally, Mañjuśṛī stands up and objects to this, and explains in short:

Not all rivers are winding,
not all women are deceitful,
not all groves are wooded, 
and not all lords are happy.  

After Mañjuśṛī's explanation, the Buddha responds with the analogy of medicine. Then there is the gender transformation of Kotaka's daughter, and the sūtra concludes shortly thereafter, at least in the Tibetan recension. 

And of course, the only gender that is subject to any negative tropes in this sūtra on the basis of gender are women. So, sexist. We really should poll women on this passage, to see how they feel about. I am pretty sure of the outcome.

Chinese translations often show stages of accretion in a given sūtra, where as Tibetan translations tend to show sūtra texts in their mature forms as they existed in Northern India, since sūtra translation in China started in the second century CE and only in the 8th century CE in Tibet. 

Because the Sanskrit of these texts is often hard to parse, having the Chinese and Tibetan are invaluable aids for translators, since they form a kind of commentary. We are still 100 years away from having the best translations we can muster. So we do our best.

Of course. However, that point is made more effectively in other sūtras than this one. It is not a central or crucial passage in main body of the sūtra's argument but it is sterling example of sexism in sūtra composition. We can, of course, attempt to forensically understand why this particular statement was made, but all we will really come up with, as we both agree, is that the passage was written at a time when women were more disenfranchised than they are now, at least in most modern countries. The significance of the passage is that it shows how disenfranchised women were when the Mahāyāna sūtras were composed. This is how we should understand passages in sutras where women are encouraged to aspire to be born as men; where buddhafields are described as desirable because beings there only have penises; other episodes where women undergo gender transformation merely upon hearing a sūtra, such as in the Māyopamasamādhi Sūtra, and so on. 

Anyway, we've beat this dead horse into dog meat...

There are too many places in the sutras where women are put down, their ability to attain buddhahood, and so on, denied, etc. Indeed, this what the samaya against denigrating women serves to correct. Simply put, in Vajrayana it is understood that to criticize women on the basis of their gender is to criticize wisdom itself. Since the Buddha would never do do this, we must accept such passages which criticize women on the basis of their gender to be errors of transcription.

Casual racism may not be ill-intentioned,  but it’s still racism. No one can ever say it is skillful. Likewise, the casual sexism that we sometimes find in sutras and tantras, reflective of another era, is certainly not intended to harm, but it is a product of harm to sentient beings—women—in any case. There is a passage in the Sandhivyakarana Tantra that runs something like“The single delightful vajra word is heard variously by different people according to differences in capacities,” meaning that everything written down about what the Buddha said is limited by how this single vajra word was received. The consequence of this hermeneutic strategy is that anything written down about what the Buddha said can be subject to critical evaluation, and anything found wanting is not a fault to be addressed to the Buddha, but rather to those who attempted to write down what they thought he said.

This is why such such words cannot be used as an inducement for women today, and frankly, given the fact the women during the time this sutra was composed were subject to strident masculine oppression in general, it is unlikely that such words would have been read or heard by women at all, further reinforcing their completely sexist content.  Why? The target of this statement is men, who fear feminization. The statement amounts to the sentiment, “if one does accept x doctrine, one is a sissy.”

Sure, signs such as seeing one hundred buddhas, visiting one hundred buddhafields, and so on, which are a sign of attaining the first bhumi, are straight forward and objective. 

Or alternately, signs such as the intense pain of pranayama practices and so on, which result when ordinary people practice completion stage practices related the nadis, vayus, and bindus, are also straight forward and objective, as are signs like smoke, fireflies, and so on, which are signs of the vayus entering the central channel. These are all "realizations."

The point is that people like to say "So and so is realized" without knowing anything about the person, other than just passing along rumors they have heard about this teacher and that. I can't tell you the number of ads I have seen for this and that teacher "praising them as highly realized" without specifying what that realization is. Calling teachers "realized" is just advertising puffery. 

My guru, Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, used to reject the idea that he was a rtogs ldan, a person possessing realization, and basically said that if any of his students wanted to prove they were realized they should be able to hold their hand in fire without it becoming damaged in anyway.

If you don't enjoy your practice, there is no point in doing it. 

The approach to so-called preliminary practices varies quite a bit from lineage to lineage. For instance, in the Sakya school, people are introduced to the practice of a major yidam, such as Hevajra, immediately, and rather than focusing accumulating ngondro, spend time learning the sadhana and focusing on maintaining the daily commitment. Generally, ngondro is something in the Sakya school which one does when one goes into a retreat. The Sakyapas did not even have a text on Ngondro specifically until the 1940's, written by a Nalendra khenpo who was inspired by Words of My Precious Teacher (full disclosure, I have translated this text and it is sitting at Wisdom, waiting to be edited). Even here, the explanation is combined with four sadhanas, and there was no separate text for Ngondro until Dezhung Rinpoche wrote one in the 1970's. 

The Gelukpas also have a different approach, their "ngondro" is Lamrim in its entirety, even though they have a special set of nine 100,000 practices, but they are not prerequisites for anything. They can be done anytime one has time.

The structured ngondro program is more characteristic of Nyingma and Karma Kagyu. Drigung is very heavy on ngondro accumulations, especially in how they present the Yangzab teachings, requiring, in the older manuals, 400,000 of each. Modern teachers like Ontul Rinpoche and the late Gyalpo Rinpoche, however, relaxed such requirements.  

As for "not my thing," lets say you received a Vajravārāhī initiation, but you prefer Vajrabhairava, which you have also received, there is no fault. 

In general, non-Tibetans develop this uptight attitude about "doing things right." Instead of developing a broad, open, relaxed attitude, they become puritanical, insisting on some sort of orthopraxy, becoming overly self-critical, as well as critical of others, whom they feel are "not doing things right."

In reality, Ngondro is a main practice. Why? It is just three different ways of relating the guru. Properly speaking, Mandala offerings are in fact part of guru yoga. If one understands the meaning of the dissolution of the refuge tree, one can even attain complete awakening merely doing refuge. Or, if one has sufficient devotion, as Virupa says, one can attain mahamudra realization merely by serving one's guru without meditating even for a single second.

Hate to say it, but there is no such thing as a Tibetan meditation cushion. You might be thinking of a so-called gomden, which Chogyam Trungpa had invented for Westerners. Otheerwise, the cushions we use in nearly all western Dharma centers are variations on Japanese floor mats and pillows via the Zen tradition.

What do you mean by “realize.” Why is it important to realize a dakini? What does that mean? What is a sufficient degree of realization?

Of course. Ngondro contains within it all the key points of creation and completion stage.
